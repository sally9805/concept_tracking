Section : Frightening the Public <p> It is man 's indomitable nature to scare himself silly for no good reason .  --  Calvin and Hobbes <p> <p> Home buying used to be a relatively simple procedure . Purchasers looked at the ads , visited the open houses , worked with a broker or tried negotiating directly with an owner . The concerns were mainly practical or aesthetic . Would the bank or savings and loan grant the mortgage ? Was the backyard big enough for a swing set and a garden ? Would the kitchen accommodate a breakfast table and chairs ? <p> Nowadays the concerns have turned into deep-seated anxieties . Does the ceiling have asbestos ? Is there radon in the basement ? Does the paint have lead ? Do power lines running close to the house pose a risk of cancer ? An industry of inspectors , contractors , and attorneys derives its livelihood from the disclosure and remediation of these problems , if problems they be . <p> Therein lies the rub , for the perception of danger and the reality of a safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it has become exceedingly difficult to differentiate between the two . The media assault the home buyer with stories of 30,000 lung cancer deaths traceable to radon exposure or the danger from asbestos , to say nothing of lead coating the walls of apartments . The more cautious analyses generally surface in the scientific literature , but these are rarely read by the average potential home buyer . <p> The following article provides a brief summary of three specters detailed in Haunted Housing ( Cato Institute , 1997 )  --  an overview of the research , the controversies in the press , and the effect in dollars and cents on the home buying public . Asbestos : An Over-Reaction <p> The best known and the oldest of fears revolve around asbestos , a mineral once prized for its ability to protect against fire , to deaden sound , and to resist friction . Used liberally in shipbuilding , in construction , and in automobiles , failure to acknowledge and protect against its potentially deadly effect on the lungs has led to a widespread and costly over-reaction , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it completely from industrial and commercial use . <p> Asbestos is a fibrous inorganic mineral occurring naturally in certain rock formations . ( As a result of weathering , fibers are even found in outdoor air . ) Of the six forms , chrysotile or " white asbestos " is the most common and the predominant fiber type , composing 90% to 95% of the asbestos used in U.S. buildings . Crocidolite or " blue " asbestos and amosite or " brown " asbestos appear most often in pipe and boiler insulation . <p> The risk of disease from accumulated exposure to asbestos depends not only on duration and level of exposure but especially on the length and width of the fibers , which influence the depth of their penetration into the lung . The " white " fibers of chrysotile are curly , often short , and very thin ; so they penetrate less deeply into the lung . Moreover , chrysotile , which is relatively soluble in the human cell , tends to deteriorate more rapidly . In comparison , the amphibole fibers of " blue " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier for them to burrow deep into the lung tissue and harder for the body 's natural defenses to remove them . <p> Studies of asbestos in occupational and non-occupational settings have led to a growing consensus among scientists that the " white " fiber is much less harmful than the " blue " or " brown " amphibole fibers associated with the majority of asbestos-associated lung diseases . Federal policy in the United States , however , fails to draw such distinctions ; and the widespread use of the all-encompassing term , " asbestos , " has blurred the differences . As a result , the complex question of appropriate responses to a possible threat has slipped from sight to be replaced , in many cases , by an all-pervasive panic . <p> Why Use Asbestos ? The fire-retarding properties of asbestos have been recognized for centuries . Widespread use of asbestos , however , had to await the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century with its need for insulation against high temperatures . Mining , milling , shipbuilding , and manufacturing found uses for asbestos . In the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and siding shingles . The automobile industry incorporated asbestos into friction devices , such as brake linings and clutch pads . Jointing compounds , gaskets , coatings , and sealants often contained asbestos . <p> In the home , prior to 1978 , decorative plasters often contained asbestos . An easily identifiable remnant of that era are the " cottage cheese " ceilings , with or without glitter , so-called because of their rough , pebbly texture . The troweled ceilings made construction cheaper and easier , substituting for careful and expensive sanding and multiple coats of paint ; the addition of asbestos made the plaster easier to spread . Asbestos insulated the many arms of coal-fired furnaces . Vinyl floor tiles often contained asbestos as did some patching compounds , adhesives , and mastics . To deaden sound , asbestos became an element of acoustical ceilings . Until the mid-1970s free-standing ovens and dishwashers were often wrapped in insulating blankets or sheets that contained asbestos . <p> Appliances are relatively short-lived and the new models are asbestos-free . American houses and public buildings , on the other hand , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building them is omnipresent . Unless old or substantially damaged , especially by moisture , these materials release few fibers into the air . In other words , the mere presence of asbestos containing material ( ACM ) , contrary to popular report , does not of necessity pose a risk . <p> The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) argued for many years , however , that the mere presence of deteriorating ACM indicated potential exposure . It insisted that " one fiber can kill , " adopting the so-called linear no-threshold theory , which assumes the risk of cancer is linearly proportional to the absorbed dose and that any exposure may carry some risk . Statisticians tend to view the model skeptically as a naive method of prediction , but the EPA has stood fast . Compounding the problem , the agency claimed that visual inspection of ACM would suffice in assessing a potential problem . In fact , the measurement of airborne fibers constitutes the critical factor in estimating exposures . With the passage of time and the accumulation of measurements , the latter view has largely prevailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and billions more on lawsuits . <p> Health and Asbestos . During the Second World War paints , plasters , and fire retardants containing asbestos delayed or prevented that most dreaded of naval disasters , fire at sea , easily caused by exploding shells . The process of applying those materials , at the insistence of government , exposed some four million shipyard workers , who often labored in cramped quarters with little ventilation , to dangerous levels of asbestos . In other words , there was a net tradeoff : the asbestos that saved the lives of seamen jeopardized the lives of ship builders . <p> Recognition of the health problems associated with asbestos was slow in coming , but shortly after the Second World War reports on the dangers of occupational exposure began to appear with increasing frequency . <p> In the 1960s , Dr. Irving J. Selikoff confirmed that exposure to asbestos increased lung cancer rates , especially among smokers . He made no distinction among the types of fibers and others followed his lead . In 1964 Selikoff chaired a symposium at the New York Academy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what one analyst termed " a pandemic of mediagenic disease . " <p> Cigarettes would bear a large part of the responsibility . Selikoff 's studies demonstrated conclusively that smoking increased risks from asbestos 80 to 90 times ; the media and , later , the EPA generally ignored that link . Selikoff himself kept the spotlight on asbestos as the culprit . As study followed study , however , it became increasingly clear that smoking while handling asbestos multiplied the risk , although the relationship between the two might depend on the type of asbestos involved , another connection either ignored or never made by Selikoff and the EPA . <p> The numbers of those affected mounted steadily . During the late 1970s , Selikoff estimated 40,000 excess deaths annually over the next decade attributable to asbestos . He was unable to justify the projections , however , and reduced the estimate , first to 20,000 , then to 12,000 and finally , in 1983 , to 8,200 . <p> Unfortunately the EPA came to rely heavily on Selikoff 's assertions , making no distinctions among fiber types and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate was the continuing focus in the media on asbestos , rather than smoking , as the prime cause of lung disease , even though many of the shipyard workers , the subjects of Selikoff 's original studies , had been heavy smokers of unfiltered cigarettes . <p> Gradually during the 1970s the federal government began to restrict the use of asbestos. ( * ) In 1978 , the U.S. Department of Health , Education , and Welfare launched a major campaign to promote public awareness of asbestos , especially among those who had worked in the shipyards during World War II . Unfortunately its wildly exaggerated estimates  --  50,000 deaths annually from asbestos  --  fanned the flames of public anxiety . Within three years , a highly respected group of epidemiologists and statisticians had demolished the inflated claims , reducing the figure to 4,000 cancer cases annually from occupational exposure , always higher than residential ; but the higher toll tended to stay in the public mind . <p> Focus on the Schools . Early in the 1980s , reports of asbestos in a number of public schools began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1982 , the EPA issued its rule on asbestos , requiring public and private elementary and secondary schools to inspect for asbestos . Congress followed suit in 1986 with the passage of the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Acts ( AHERA ) . Contrary to popular opinion , there was no sweeping requirement that all asbestos be removed . Only if asbestos-containing materials in schools were " significantly damaged " was removal dictated since frayed asbestos , it was believed , would release fibers into the air . Demolition or substantial remodeling would also trigger abatement . Otherwise the government required only that parents and employees be notified of the presence of asbestos . Predictably , employees and parents demanded removal . <p> The damage in dollars , anxiety , and elevated risk created by this approach has yet to be fully assessed . Local evaluations , generally based on visual inspection , an unreliable gauge of exposure , led to extensive removal operations . These increased ambient air levels of airborne fibers , raising the threat to abatement workers and to those who reoccupied the buildings , since the fibers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1988 the EPA 's price tag for about 107,000 primary and secondary schools was $3.4 billion . Removal from schools led to removal from all public buildings eventually pushing the estimate to $100 billion to $150 billion for removal and renovation . <p> The asbestos scare has impoverished many school districts , diminishing the quality of education . Gone are the computers , the smaller classes , the more up-to-date texts . There remains only the bill for the abatement contractor . <p> Public Dictates ; Private Costs . The regulation also had a ripple effect . In the commercial sphere , fearful that the EPA would eventually mandate removal of any and all asbestos , whatever its condition , many building owners decided to get rid of it , whatever the cost . The reluctance or refusal of banks to lend on asbestos-containing buildings , coupled with the concerns of actual or prospective tenants , undoubtedly hastened many such decisions . <p> On the housing front , the specter of asbestos complicated the purchase of a home , increasing costs for both buyers and sellers . Real estate brokers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspections became more frequent . Theoretically these benefited the buyer by providing him with more information and enabling him to make a rational appraisal of risk . In practice , thanks to entrenched fears , a finding of asbestos often produced panic and led to lengthy negotiations between the parties . In many cases , a coat of paint on the asbestos-containing troweled ceiling would have effectively encapsulated the fibers ; but the EPA had so thoroughly convinced the public that " one fiber can kill " that many sellers undertook expensive and dangerous removal projects or tried to split the costs with buyers who , especially in the frantic real estate market of the 1980s , were often desperate for housing . In other cases , the contract was simply rescinded , leaving the seller to search for other buyers and the buyers scrambling for another property  --  expensive and time-consuming enterprises . <p> Whatever the outcome , the toll in dollars and distress was generally needless . Moreover , asbestos remains in uncounted homes , in thousands of schools , and in hundreds of thousands of commercial buildings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree , however , that the level of risk from those sources is vanishingly small . <p> The Leviathan 's Response . The EPA and the Congress were slow to respond to the careful studies indicating that asbestos was not invariably lethal . In 1990 , however , the EPA did at last depart from its course of pushing for removal as the only permanent solution . In its " Green Book " of that year , Managing Asbestos in Place , the agency was still insisting that " all fibers are of equal concern " and that removal was required during renovation and demolition ; but in most other instances in-place management would suffice . Finally , in its 1992 " Advisory to the Public on Asbestos in Buildings , " the EPA made a startling admission . After years of claiming that " one fiber can kill , " it asserted : " The present scientific evidence will not allow us to state unequivocally that there is a level of exposure below which there is a zero risk , but the risk at these low levels in fact could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data indicating that disease was a function of the degree of exposure was having an effect . <p> The agency continued to press for a ban on the manufacturing , importation , and processing of almost all products containing asbestos . Fortunately for the many industries dependent on asbestos for its resistance to heat and friction , the courts struck down the ban . Nevertheless , fear of the material and of possible lawsuits led to the introduction of substitutes which may well be equally carcinogenic . Radon : Skepticism Warranted <p> In comparison with asbestos , radon qualifies as a newcomer in terms of housing specters . Colorless , odorless , and tasteless , it is produced by a nuclear decay chain beginning with uranium in rocks and soil . Since uranium ores are widespread , it is present virtually everywhere in the United States , escaping constantly into the atmosphere or into the water of deep wells . It seeps into houses through cracks in the slab or the foundation , so levels in the basement will be the highest in the home . Diffusion reduces the levels on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have disappeared. ( * ) <p> Radon generates fear because the EPA has alleged that it is a carcinogen , responsible for 7,000 to 30,000 cases of lung cancer annually . The public , however , has remained generally apathetic : perhaps 5% of homes have been tested ; fewer still have undergone remediation . <p> Historical Development . Radon was virtually unknown until the concern with nuclear weapons after the Second World War led to an expanded search for uranium , especially in the Colorado plateau . The mines were dusty , dirty , poorly ventilated " dog holes . " To make matters worse , most of the miners smoked . <p> Meanwhile studies in Europe and the United States confirmed that prolonged exposure to radon caused lung cancer . In the late 1960s , the U.S. Public Health Service set an occupational limit on the amount of gas to which an American miner could be exposed ; but radon remained a distant concern until the day in 1984 when Stanley Watras , an engineer , set off a radiation detection device on his way into work at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his home had a radon level 16 times that permitted uranium miners . The house sat atop on old uranium mine ; his neighbors had no such problem , foreshadowing later discoveries of " hot houses " and " hot spots . " <p> Suddenly radon became a domestic menace . The EPA , extrapolating from studies of the lung cancer rates of workers exposed to high levels of radon , asserted that radon in homes posed an equivalent risk , despite the quite different levels and conditions . In doing so , it adopted the linear no-threshold model already applied to asbestos . <p> As a result , the agency embarked on a long-term campaign to alert householders to the dangers of radon , to urge testing , and to push for remediation when radon reached an " action level " of four or more picocuries per liter of air. ( ** ) The Swedes and the Finns deal equably with a national average for indoor radon twice that of the United States  --  2.7 pCi/l as opposed to 1.3  --  but the EPA continues to assert that radon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , greeted such assertions with a yawn ; and the agency , frustrated , tried to sow toxic terror through its ads . Billboards in the Washington , D.C. metro screamed , " Call 1-800 ... RADON ; " in 1994 , the National Children 's Theater for the Environment , under a contract with the EPA , toured elementary schools in Pennsylvania and New England with a musical , " Jeff Meets the Intruders , " that is , Passive Smoke , Dust Mites , and Radon . Even more graphic was a television spot depicting a family gathering . Exposed to radon , the children turned to skeletons . That tactic backfired : the ad created such protest that it was dropped . <p> To publicize the " intruder , " the EPA , together with the U.S. Surgeon General , issued an unprecedented health advisory in 1988 , urging that every home be tested for radon . To inspect and test and to reduce " unsafe levels " would cost between $50 billion and $1 trillion , but the agency seemed unfazed by the prospect . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reauthorized in 1992 , articulating as a national goal that indoor air should be as free of radon as the outdoors . This was , of course , sheer nonsense since the pressure differentials of man-made construction will always suck in soil gases , giving rise to levels above those in the atmosphere where radon is diffused . <p> As a consequence , the EPA spent four years working with the National Association of Home Builders to develop radon-resistant construction standards for new housing . These emphasized the sealing of cracks in the slab and the installation of a 4-inch pipe running from the foundation through the roof so that the owner could install a fan for ventilation . The cost ? $350 to $500 for every new home , independent of the location and regardless of the buyer 's wishes or his pocketbook . <p> The Likely Culprit and the Solution . As with asbestos , the EPA notes consistently that the risk to smokers is greater than the risk to nonsmokers . Never , however , does it emphasize the link or suggest that changing one 's lifestyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of radon than expensive mitigation strategies . <p> One analysis notes that the elimination of smoking could control more than 90% of the lung cancer risk associated with radon without effecting changes in radon concentrations . A recent Swedish study notes that smoking and radon interact synergistically to increase risk since smokers in the highest exposure group were 25 to 30 times more likely to develop lung cancer than nonsmokers in the lowest exposure group . Smoking multiplies the risk , rather than just adding to it . <p> A reduction in smoking is certain to reduce the incidence of lung cancer , but the EPA has n't campaigned against cigarettes . Instead it campaigns for costly testing and mitigation procedures that , if successful , might or might not affect lung cancer rates . <p> A Shift in Perspective . Smoking aside , is it worthwhile to test and mitigate , given the uncertain results of testing , which vary with time of day and season of the year , and the expense of elaborate venting systems ? A number of analyses have suggested that the risk fails to warrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cohort of Finns for nearly 20 years , corrected for smoking prevalence , and concluded that there was no increased risk of lung cancer from indoor radon exposure . <p> Professor Bernard Cohen of the University of Pittsburgh first wrote in CR in 1986 of the dangers of radon as a carcinogen , supporting the position of the EPA. ( * ) Recently , however , he noted to the author that his ideas have changed , that he once believed in the linear-no-threshold theory and was much surprised when the data showed that it was wrong . <p> " On the contrary , " he states , " there is indisputable evidence that low doses of radiation enhance the body 's Biological Defense Mechanisms .... It has also been shown that low-dose radiation stimulates the activity of the immune system .... These observations completely negate the only basis for LNT Linear-No-Threshold and there is a clear suggestion that low-level radiation may actually be protective against cancer . " <p> The relevant data have emerged " from a compilation of average radon levels in homes for 1,729 U.S. counties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90% of the total U.S. population . The results show a statistically indisputable tendency for lung cancer rates , with or without correction for smoking prevalence , to decrease with increasing radon level .... " These results take into account the effects of over 60 potential confounding factors and indicate " that LNT fails in the low-dose region , grossly over estimating the cancer risk from low-level radiation . " <p> Unfortunately , many home buyers must continue to deal with the anxiety and expense fueled by sweeping official pronouncements on the dangers of radon at the levels normally found in homes . Professor Cohen does note that the EPA must follow the lead of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Council of Radiation Protection , but that the scientific community is trying to bring about changes in the positions of these organizations supporting LNT . <p> It is to be hoped that these will be forthcoming in the near future . In the meantime , as with asbestos , skepticism is warranted . Lead : Stop , Declare Victory <p> The saga of lead 's ill effects is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , interfering with neural development , depressing intelligence , and causing kidney damage . Over the past 25 years , as the dangers have become better known , the campaign to eliminate lead has gathered steam , spreading not only justified warnings but unjustified anxiety and expense . <p> That lead could pose a problem had actually been perceived much earlier . Benjamin Franklin warned printers ' apprentices against handling warm type . Painters were admonished to wash their hands before eating to avoid " painter 's colic . " The threat to public health , however , emerged in the 1950s when deteriorating lead paint was found to be the probable cause of childhood lead poisoning in older cities with their reservoir of decrepit housing and peeling paint . <p> Before federal action , in 1955 , the paint industry voluntarily limited lead in paint for interior uses to 1% by weight while local jurisdictions began adopting the same standard for their codes . However , lead-based paint was still widely used until , in 1978 , the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned its sale to the construction industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lead poisoning was the pewter used in tableware , cooking utensils , and storage containers . The seams of " tin " cans were often soldered with lead . In 1972 , the American Society for Testing and Materials restricted lead content in pewter to 1/20th of 1% by weight ; and the industry complied voluntarily . Catalogues and grocery stores began to carry notices , " Contains no lead , " while plastic began to substitute for " tin " cans and pewter plates . <p> Copper and sometimes plastic began to replace lead in piping systems and household plumbing . In 1986 , the Department of Housing and Urban Development banned the use of lead in solder and leaded brass on submersible pumps . Lead 's uses were contracting rapidly . <p> By far the most dramatic and effective action , however , was the EPA 's prohibition on lead in gasoline in the early 1970s . Levels of airborne lead fell sharply . In 1970 , automobiles spewed 200,000 metric tons of lead into the air in the United States . By 1991 and 1992 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to continue as the use of lead in gasoline has now been completely prohibited nationwide . ( Actually , the EPA deserves only partial credit for the dramatic decline . The automobile industry had actively promoted the restriction since lead in gasoline fouled the newly introduced catalytic converters . ) <p> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that the removal of lead from gasoline and from the lead in " tin " cans have been the major contributors to the decrease in blood lead levels over the past quarter-century . The levels of blood lead identified by the CDC as " levels of concern " have fallen dramatically , from 60 micrograms per deciliter ( 60 Mug/dl ) in 1970 to 10 Mug/dl in 1990 , a six-fold reduction . <p> Today , one of the most persistent sources of lead in the environment is still lead paint , especially in the inner cities . Two federal laws form the basis for regulation of lead paint : the Lead-Based Poisoning Prevention Act of 1971 , amended in 1972 , 1976 , 1988 , and the most recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Most important from the consumer 's viewpoint , the 1992 act required that a booklet be prepared for all prospective buyers or tenants of housing built before 1978 to notify them of the possible hazards of lead . After four years of debate between HUD and the EPA , a booklet for properties with more than four units was released in September 1996 and for other properties in December 1996 . <p> Sellers and landlords must now disclose all known information about lead in the property , deliver the pamphlet , entitled " Protect Your Family from Lead in Your Home , " to prospects and give them 10 days to conduct a risk assessment at their own expense . For sellers , landlords , and agents , failure to disclose or to deliver the pamphlet carries civil and criminal penalties , including imprisonment and a $10,000 fine . In fact , the real estate community had outdistanced the federal government : by 1996 roughly 30 states had already established disclosure requirements which , in general , referenced lead . <p> Twenty-five years of legislative battles about lead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable for the often rancorous debate between the housing approach and the health approach . The latter called for the screening of children to determine blood lead levels , identification and treatment of those with elevated lead levels , and the de-leading of their homes . The housing approach , much broader in focus , involved demonstration and research programs aimed at the de-leading of all housing that contained lead . The research eventually indicated that de-leading the nation 's entire housing stock would impose costs now estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars . Budget constraints have created a reality check : the federal government has largely consigned de-leading to demonstration programs and to the states . Even public housing , once a candidate for wholesale removal , must now be de-leaded only during remodeling and rehabilitation . <p> Although the debate on the benefits of universal screening continues , there has been a shift in lead policy akin to the shift in policy on asbestos . From " search and destroy , " the emphasis has shifted to containment , that is , making lead paint inaccessible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since lead paint is no longer in common use , lead dust now receives greater attention as a health hazard . <p> Weak Policy Foundations . Despite the dramatic drop in blood lead levels and emphasis on containment , rather than removal , EPA and HUD continue to view lead as a primary health menace still worthy of extensive expenditures . This approach is traceable largely to the work of one man , Dr. Herbert Needleman , a professor of child psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh . In 1979 , in the New England Journal of Medicine , he published a study purporting to show that children with relatively high , although not toxic , levels of blood lead had measurably lower IQs and performed less well in the classroom . <p> The study came in for sustained attack on the grounds that the data were allegedly manipulated to achieve the desired results . In 1992 , a University Hearing Board concluded that there had been " deliberate misrepresentation ; " the federal Office of Research Integrity essentially agreed , noting that there had been , quoting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , omissions , contradictions , and incomplete information ... ' " <p> For most research findings , such criticism would surely mean a diminution of support . It has not touched Needleman 's work , which has become a cornerstone of EPA policy . Needleman , meantime , continues to insist that lead poses a threat nationwide , despite the demonstrable drop in blood lead levels and the relegation of lead to the decaying housing of the inner cities . <p> Consequences . This high level of concern has had unfortunate and expensive repercussions . Despite studies which suggest that there may indeed be a level below which lead presents no danger and others which caution against creating undue anxiety , many states are adopting regulations aimed at eliminating lead , whatever the cost . Massachusetts is leading the pack with Draconian regulations requiring full de-leading . Landlords pay at least $5,000 to de-lead one unit and the cost can easily go much higher . They can expect little help . Federal grants that flow through the state cover administrative expenses , inspection , laboratory , and social services but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than lead paint on the walls  --  lead dust in the air , on the furniture , in the dust around the house or apartment . Difficult to control , it can last for years : children playing in the dirt pick it up , as do pets rollicking through the yard . Frequent hand washing can help , although the EPA has never emphasized hygiene . A more practical approach might be simply to leave the leaded paint in place and paint over it . But it has proven difficult to persuade legislators of the budgetary and health benefits this approach provides . <p> In addition , landlords now live in fear of a lawsuit alleging damage to a child . So great is the anxiety that many quietly refuse to rent to families with children , despite federal law banning discrimination . Such fears are depleting the low-income housing stock . It is far from uncommon to hear of an elderly couple who bought a duplex in the belief that the rents would supplement their retirement income only to discover that the property contains lead . Faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property and certainly greater than the rents for many years to come , they sell it at a loss or simply walk away , allowing the bank to acquire a burdensome piece of real estate . This scenario repeats itself frequently , for only owners of extensive properties can afford the expense of renovating units and the cost of a staff attorney . <p> The lead scenario now imposes greater costs than radon or asbestos . For asbestos , the more rational policy of " management in place " has reduced costs and avoided the risks to health created by removal . The skepticism with which the public has greeted radon seems to have contained costs , although the debate continues on the threat to health . The concern with children 's health has , however , overshadowed the great progress already made and left the door open for litigation that is reducing the nation 's stock of low-income housing . Given the low levels of lead in the environment , it would be appropriate to declare victory ; ironically federal and state officials keep moving the goalposts . <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration adopted standards for exposure in the workplace . In 1972 , the EPA prohibited the spraying of asbestos-containing materials for insulation. , fire protection , and soundproofing . Two years later it prohibited asbestos in pipe covering . In 1977 , the Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) banned patching compounds containing respirable asbestos . At no time , however , did the EPA or the CPSC present a coherent quantitative cost-benefit analysis of the risks involved . <p> ( * ) Radon itself poses no substantial health risks since it has a half-life of approximately four days , meaning that it will be exhaled before it decays . The problem arises from radon 's short-lived decay products , its " daughters " or " progeny , " which have half-lives measured in minutes to microseconds . Once in the lungs , they decay and release radioactivity , generally in the form of alpha particles which can penetrate lung tissue with ease . The distinction between the gas and its progeny makes little practical difference , however , since measurements of radon provide information about its decay products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radioactivity equivalent to one-trillionth of a Curie ; 4 pCi/1 would equal 8.8 disintegrations per minute . <p> ( * ) See " Radon : Our Worst Radiation Hazard , " April 1986 .
