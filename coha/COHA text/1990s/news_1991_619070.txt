<p> Throughout the fall , the state 's top educators met quietly with a small group of conservative politicians and businessmen to settle differences and forge a plan that would allow all California parents to choose which schools their children attend . <p> At stake were basic issues of civil rights and constitutionality : <p> Should public money be spent to send California children to private and religious schools ? To public schools outside a child 's own district ? Would a plan increasing choices mean better schools for poor children , or more segregation of rich and poor ? <p> Not surprisingly , the participants  --  including state Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig and state Assemblyman Charles Quackenbush ( R- Cupertino )  --  failed to resolve these questions . Instead , they set off a statewide battle between two competing education proposals , with one racing through the Legislature and the other toward the ballot box . <p> California 's struggle with the concept of school choice mirrors similar battles in several states over one of the most divisive and emotional issues in education today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by more than a decade of rancor , are trying to turn the rhetoric into reality for thousands of schoolchildren . <p> This year alone , 10 states enacted some form of legislation on school choice , and 37  --  in cluding California  --  had bills pending . Last year , seven states adopted such plans . <p> These developments suggest that the debate has taken a sharp new turn , in which policymakers once opposed to school choice altogether are now arguing about what form it should take . <p> " Five years ago , I would have recoiled at any mention of choice , " said Paul Warren , dean of the School of Education at the University of San Francisco . " But now , I have frankly come to the point in which ( I feel ) something needs to be interjected to effect change . Choice has that virtue . " <p> THE OPTIONS <p> The proposals cover a spectrum , from allowing parents to select any public school within a district , to letting students cross district lines , to providing tax-supported vouchers for private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even for religious schools . <p> The latter plan is the most controversial of all , raising not only legal questions about separation of church and state but the ire of public school officials who see it as siphoning off hard-won money and sending it to private enterprise . <p> In California , the voucher idea is at the crux of the debate between Superintendent Honig and Los Angeles businessman Joseph Alibrandi , who is pursuing a ballot initiative for 1992 in the hope that voters will want to spend their money to subsidize tuitions at private and religious schools . <p> Such a plan has been rejected consistently by state legislatures , most recently by Pennsylvania on December 10 . But it has strong support from President Bush , who has begun a national drive for this alternative . <p> COMPETITION <p> This so-called free-market approach is based on the supposition that schools , like other enterprises , perform best when forced to compete . Public schools , the theory goes , have become top-heavy with administrators and slow to change because customers  --  students and their parents  --  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piqued the interest of many in business , which have long been frustrated with the quality of American job applicants . <p> Among the most outspoken advocates for this ultimate version of school choice are John Chubb of the Brookings Institution and Terry Moe , a political science professor at Stanford University . In their 1990 book " Politics , Markets and America 's Schools , " they wrote : <p> " Private educators , trying to succeed in a market where parents can take or leave their schools , are compelled to organize their schools in ways that are most sensitive to and most effective in meeting parent and student demands . Generally this means concentrating resources at the school level . . . focusing sharply on tangible results , like academic achievement , and involving parents  --  who , after all , are doing the choosing  --  deeply in the school . " <p> Superintendent Honig , who heads the nation 's largest school system , favors allowing parents to choose from among public schools only . Taxpayer money for private schools " risks creating elite academies for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " If competition is supposed to produce savings , look at colleges , ( where ) costs are skyrocketing . " <p> Albert Shanker , head of the American Federation of Teachers , agreed that schools need more incentives but said public subsidy of private schools is wrong . Evidence that private schools educate the broad population better than public schools do is weak , he says . <p> " It is a value within our democratic system to let people choose , " he said , " but not a strategy for improving education . " <p> INCLINATION OF PUBLIC <p> Nevertheless , by 50 percent to 30 percent , the public favors using tax-financed vouchers for tuition at private or religious schools , with support strongest among nonwhites and inner-city dwellers , according to a Gallup Poll published in September . <p> Nationwide , a variety of school- choice models are in place . Among them is an 8-year-old program in one New York school district , East Harlem , that has been widely praised for improving performance and graduation rates . Once ranked 32nd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created theme schools for public students to choose from . <p> The district now ranks 17th . " Choice is not the one answer to any question , " said John Falco , an architect of the program . " But choice was a catalyst for us . " <p> The results have been less encouraging in Massachusetts , where the choice program extends beyond school district boundaries and allows unlimited numbers of students to transfer . <p> Each district loses nearly $ 5,000 for each student who chooses to go elsewhere , and three poor districts have lost $ 1.6 million so far . Last week , Governor William Weld allocated $ 2.1 million to school districts " particularly hurt by the state 's new school choice law . " <p> Since voters approved the program in September , just 28 of 361 districts have signed up . <p> PRIVATE SCHOOL <p> Among the most controversial experiments is one in Milwaukee , which pays for about 650 low-income students to attend private school . The year-old program is being challenged in court , but an independent evaluation issued November 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Test scores did not rise significantly in that program but parent involvement improved , according to the report by John Witte , a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin . <p> " Not only are the choice parents considerably more satisfied than Milwaukee public school parents , " he wrote , " they are much more satisfied than they were with their prior school . " <p> In California , students are often allowed to choose a school within their own district . But Honig recently threw his support behind a bill by Quackenbush that would allow students to attend any public school in the state . Only a limited number of children could leave a district , and no district would have to accept transfers . <p> The bill awaits a hearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee . No other school choice bill has progressed as far in the Legislature . <p> During Honig 's recent meetings with Quackenbush and businessman Alibrandi , former chairman of the California Business Roundtable 's education task force , Honig asked Alibrandi to support the Quackenbush bill . But the soft- spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school  --  public , private or religious . <p> He predicted his ballot campaign could win , despite setbacks of similar efforts in other states . <p> " This movement will sweep the nation like a wildfire , " he said . " California is the linchpin. "
