Heaven and Earth have sworn that the truth shall remain forever hidden . -I . B. Singer , " The Dead Fiddler " <p> TO AVOID CONFUSION , I must tell you that although this " true " story will begin with an account by a real person , Adah Williams of Greenville , Mississippi , of the surreptitious blessing of a grave on a farm called The Forest in Adams County , Mississippi , Miss Adah will vanish from my story . Do n't wait for her to reappear . Her presence , though essential to the story , is accidental . She would never have spoken to me of Dunbar Marshall 's grave if we had n't happened to spend two hours together one day in 1948 , driving south from Greenville along Highway 61 . And her curious tale set me wondering and asking questions about certain lives lived out in obscurity a long time ago . <p> It 's her account of the blessing of the grave that now , in 1994 , I recall most vividly , but entangled with that memory are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other time from someone else-fleeting memories of people I knew as a child , questions I asked years later that were answered or left unanswered-whole scenes that have mysteriously stayed with me . Of the people involved only two were still alive at that time , and they were very old . Now , of course , all are dead . That 's why I put true in quotation marks . I ca n't honestly say I am telling the truth-not for sure-and there is no one left to correct me if I 'm wrong . <p> But I know , or think I know , that Mr. Marshall lived for a while at Longwood ( another house near Natchez ) and died at The Forest . One verifiable fact is that he has a gravestone , dedicated to him by his wife , Fanny , in The Forest cemetery . Presumably he 's under it . <p> Before you hear Miss Adah 's story , let me tell you about Natchez and Longwood and The Forest . Think first not of Tara and hoopskirts and ruthless southern belles but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday night prayer meetings , of ladies and gentlemen and children in worn but respectable Sunday clothes gathering to worship God and to find some order and joy in a difficult world . Think , too , of early-twentieth-century poverty , of making do in a Depression that began in the riverine South with-what ? The end of the Civil War ? The advent of railroads and the loss of the river as a highway ? The feckless clear-cutting of that hilly land ? The coming of the boll weevil in 1915 ? All of these . Sixty years ago when I was growing up , everyone I knew went to church , and almost everyone was poor . Not hungry . Not in rags ( only the Negroes were in rags ) , but poor . <p> To me ours was never a doomish , a threatening poverty , but rather the comfortable limitations that may seem to a child to be-and be , at least for a while-security . In those days paint curled off my grandmothers ' ceilings . Drapes had not been replaced in years . Scraps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mantelpiece for use as matches , to light my aunt 's cigarettes from the fire glowing in the coal grate . ( Surely there was money for matches , was n't there , if there was money for cigarettes ? Or was the jar of spills evidence of Presbyterian thrift carried to its limits ? ) In any event , for us children , there were books ( mostly very old ones , it 's true ) and someone always ready to read or tell a story . And in the country there were lakes to swim in , creeks to wade , ponds with ducks to be fed , and woods to explore . <p> Here , on the outskirts of the town of Natchez , is Longwood-a wildly extravagant Moorish castle of a mansion ( Nutt 's Folly , people called it ) left unfinished in 1861 when war broke out . No one in the Nutt family ever again had the money ( or perhaps the hubris , either ) to finish it . Instead , they and subsequent descendants sold away or lost most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the top four floors ( still littered with scaffolding , dried-up buckets of paint , canvas carpenters ' aprons , ladders , and tools ) to mice and owls and bats and children 's explorations . I remember climbing among the rafters and floor joists and looking out from the windowed dome over abandoned fields and shaggy lawns , over thickets of gum and locust and pecan that I knew must once have been gardens , because in their seasons I could see unkillable spirea and daffodils and crape myrtles still blooming . <p> Here , too , is The Forest , another country place we occasionally visited-no more doomish or gloomish than Longwood . The main house-built by an ancestor named William Dunbar-had burned years before the Civil War , and the old carriage house had been converted into a long , low cottage with a gallery across the front ( I seem to recall , though I have n't been there in more than fifty years ) . There , in the 1930s , my great-aunt Marian Davis lived with her husband , Jamie , whom she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially liked going to The Forest because Jamie and Marian had a donkey they would let us ride . Hard now to think of anything less exciting-I could n't ever kick that passive beast into so much as a trot . But ride we did . The donkey existed : my sister has a snapshot of the two of us and a cousin sitting on him , our feet almost touching the ground . And then , when we tired of riding , while the grown-ups sat on the gallery in quiet and intimate conversation , we 'd explore the ruin of the old house-nothing left but two or three crumbling columns and the half-buried foundation-and wander through the family graveyard close by . <p> The graveyard is the focus of Miss Adah 's story . <p> We were driving south from Greenville , where we both lived , on a lush spring day in 1948 , primroses and vetch awash along the ditch banks , bean and cotton rows whirling by , green spokes in the dark , flat disk of the Delta . Miss Adah , an elderly friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as far as Vicksburg , where she would visit cousins ; I was going to Natchez to see my grandmothers , both in their late eighties , both lively still but undeniably fragile , moving toward death . We 'd been exchanging tales of mutual friends and family connections-as southern women are still wont to do when they begin to get acquainted . <p> " Natchez is n't a real town , is it ? " she said . " Faulkner might have invented it . " <p> Miss Adah was one of those gracious , self-confident women who used to be the products of regular army families . She sorted people out : officers , noncoms , privates , and foreigners . She 'd seen the world and could cope with it . And she 'd married a wealthy Delta planter and no doubt could cope with him , too . <p> " Well , " I said , " the landscape .... The woods . The Spanish moss . All those movie-set pre-Civil War houses . But-I do n't know-I see it differently . Longwood , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his three brothers ) lived at Longwood for a year or two when the boys were in high school . Before that they lived too far out in the country to go to school , and their mother taught them . But when they needed to learn geometry and trig and Latin to prepare for college , they rented the Longwood house . Near enough to town to ride their horses to school . Later my grandfather inherited a little money , and they bought a house in town . " <p> " Lived there ? " Miss Adah said . " At Longwood ? " <p> " So in a way , for me , " I went on , " there 's nothing Faulknerian about it . I see that finished ground floor as a home , with my grandmother 's furniture in it-the music box ; the square piano ; her little desk , littered with bills and letters to answer ; her brown wicker rocker drawn up to the coal grate ; the Bible on her sewing table , just as I remember it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nutt-Dr . Haller Nutt 's daughter-she always lived at Longwood , " Miss Adah said . <p> " No , I think-let 's see-I think she lived there sometimes . But I know my father and his brothers . . . She must have been living somewhere else when she rented Longwood to my grandfather . I seem to recall that sometimes she lived at The Forest . Maybe that 's where she was when . . . " <p> " But that 's impossible , " she said . " There was a madwoman living at The Forest . A madwoman named Davis . " <p> " Oh ? " I said . " But . . " <p> " Yes . I suppose she 's dead now , " she said . " A country woman , I think-plain-but I 'm not sure . Maybe from an old family . " <p> I 'd been about to say , " but that was probably later . " Now , though , I felt myself closing down . I would n't volunteer any more of my vaguely remembered family gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Adah had to say about a madwoman named Davis , who was in fact my great-aunt , whom I knew well , and who in my view was not mad at all . Feisty , yes . Vigorous . Opinionated . But not mad . <p> " A patch over one eye . Fanny said she had a patch over one eye . " <p> That was my great-aunt all right . She 'd lost an eye to glaucoma in her early fifties . <p> " I suppose Miss Julia must have moved back to Longwood at some point , " I said . " I do n't know . It was all such a long time ago . " <p> " Have you ever been out there ? " Miss Adah said . " To The Forest , I mean . " <p> " Yes . Mama and my grandmother used to take us out there sometimes when we were children . " <p> " So you know that old Mr. Marshall ( his wife , Fanny , was a distant cousin of mine ) lived there for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seeing an old gentleman sitting on the gallery-of knowing who he was because I 'd seen him elsewhere  --  where ? <p> " He 's buried in The Forest cemetery , " she said . <p> " Oh ? " <p> " I believe ( family gossip-somebody heard it from Fanny ) she was abroad when Dunbar died . They 'd been separated for some years , but they were always on friendly terms . Of course , " Miss Adah said , " they were both Catholic , so there was never any question of a divorce . " <p> My impulse now is to recall that I said , " Like Spencer Tracy , " just to be catty . But I do n't think the Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn affair was common knowledge as early as 1948 . I do n't know what I said or if I said anything . I was probably silent , watching the ribbon of highway ahead and the orderly crop rows spinning by , thinking of that graveyard-untended , if my memory was accurate , surrounded by a foot-thick , six-foot-high brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creak of the gate 's hinges when my sister and I struggled to push it open . Saplings had sprung up inside , and at one place the humped roots of a very old cherry-bark oak were tilting a gravestone . <p> " In any case , " Miss Adah said , " the story is that when Fanny got home , she went down to see about a stone for his grave . No one down there , I suppose , who would have been responsible for that . His immediate family were all dead . And there might not have been anybody with money to spare for it , even if someone had wanted to . But Fanny had her own money-from her father 's family . It was when she called on Dunbar 's parish priest , to hear the details of the funeral , that she found out he 'd been buried at The Forest , that . . . " A little shiver , as of revulsion , went over Miss Adah 's shoulders . She too was Catholic , as I well knew . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unction . No mass . Not in consecrated ground . " <p> " But why . . . ? " I said . " Why not in the Natchez cemetery ? " <p> " Well , I suppose they 'd have had to buy a grave space there , " she said . " And he was a Dunbar descendant , after all . He had a perfect right to be buried in the Dunbar cemetery . I suppose this Davis woman decided that was the cheapest place to bury him . As I said , none of his family was alive except for Fanny , and she was in Europe-had been for years . " <p> " Oh , " I said , " I see , " although I did n't . <p> " But what Fanny learned was that the burial service had been Presbyterian . No priest . No nothing . " <p> " No nothing , " I echoed , thinking to myself what Aunt Marian would say about calling a Presbyterian funeral nothing . <p> " Exactly . And when she went out to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady-flew into a frenzy . " Miss Adah broke off . " Do you know who she was ? " she asked . <p> I was beginning to feel vaguely disloyal to my great-aunt . I did n't like hearing her called " this Davis woman , " though I was perfectly sure she would n't give a damn what Miss Adah 's husband or anyone else thought of what she 'd done with Mr. Dunbar Marshall 's remains . It was just that my silence was beginning to seem sneaky . Besides , since Miss Adah had Natchez connections , the truth would come out . She 'd learn exactly who I was . <p> " As a matter of fact , " I said , " the Miss Davis you 're talking about is my great-aunt . I seem to have a vague recollection of seeing Mr. Marshall-everybody called him Cousin Dunny-at The Forest . But I did n't know he was buried out there , and I did n't know he had a wife . I never heard his funeral discussed . No reason why I should . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time when they tag along with grown people . " <p> One of those people , I was thinking , who die and disappear and whom you never hear mentioned again . And thinking , too , how lonely he must have been . No family . A Catholic among Presbyterians . No priest to hear his last confession . <p> " Mercy , " Miss Adah said , " I hope I have n't offended you . " <p> " No , " I said . " I 'm interested . After all , she does have a patch over her eye . And if she is n't a madwoman , she 's certainly set in her ways . " <p> " Well , I ca n't take it back , even if she 's your aunt , " Miss Adah said . " She flew into a frenzy . Told Fanny he 'd had a perfectly good Presbyterian burial with a Presbyterian preacher and if that was n't enough to get him into heaven , he 'd just have to go the other way . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt M. running a hand through her short gray hair as if to make it stand on end , cocking her head to favor the sharp , ferocious good eye , and saying ( firmly if not frenziedly ) to anything she disapproved of , " NO . " <p> " Fanny was humiliated , " Miss Adah said . " Not just humiliated . Undone . " <p> " I can imagine , " I murmured . <p> " But not defeated , " Miss Adah said . " Not defeated . Naturally she went back to the priest for advice , and-I 'm vague on this . I think . . . he may have tried to persuade your aunt . I remember now . But your aunt was adamant . Immovable . " <p> " Catholics have never had much luck persuading Presbyterians , have they ? " I said . " Or vice versa . " I was thinking of Foxe 's Book of Martyrs on the shelf in my father 's secretary , and of the note in my greatgrandfather 's family Bible regarding his grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church in the time of Mr. Erskine and Mr. Fisher 's Secession . " <p> " King Charles I , " Miss Adah said . " Was n't it you people who turned him over to Cromwell ? " <p> " I never understood that , " I said . " He was n't really Catholic , was he ? Just Anglo-Catholic . Church of England . Could n't he just as well have become a Presbyterian ? And then it would n't have happened . " <p> " Oh , he was a good Catholic , all right . He wanted the whole country to go back to the Church . And you turned him over to Cromwell . To be murdered ! And what about St. Thomas More ? " <p> " Not guilty , " I said . " Henry VIII . " <p> " Of course , " she said . " I apologize . " <p> " But then there 's Bloody Mary , " I said . " You all have your share of villains . " Yes . We were having this conversation about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's a toss-up whose ancestors were more bloodthirsty , " I said , but all she said was , " Hmmm . " <p> After a minute she went on . " Anyhow , Fanny took the priest and went out to The Forest . She thought they would slip in quietly and bless the grave and depart without saying anything to your aunt . But the gate-the main gate-was locked . Padlocked . Chained . " <p> I saw Aunt Marian again , slight but wiry , spikes of iron-gray hair fairly vibrating , mouth drawn down , characteristically , in a knowing half-smile as she snapped the padlock through the links of chain . <p> The Forest cemetery now is just a few yards back from Highway 61 , cheek by jowl with an oil-field equipment storage area littered with piles of drums and rusting pipes , the huge carcasses of flatbed trailers , pumping units with square heads and long necks like strange prehistoric birds . There are cylindrical oil tanks large enough to live in . One pumping unit cranes its neck over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tall central cenotaph is dwarfed by an abandoned storage tank pocked with rust . <p> In the 1930s , though , there was no four-lane Highway 61 . You came to The Forest on old 61 , graveled by then , but once a dirt track between shale bluffs , worn deep into the crumbling earth first by buffalo and the Natchez Indians and later by white settlers-by us . The scene Miss Adah described-Fanny and the priests coming back at night along that winding road , finding a place to conceal the cars while they did their workhas stuck in my mind for almost fifty years . For they did come back , toward midnight a couple of days later . It took Fanny that long to make the arrangements . They came in two cars of the period ( a Model A probably , if it belonged to the diocese , as it must have , and a Buick or Cadillac , if Fanny was driving her own car ) . I can hear the loud put-put and rattle of the Model A , the smooth purr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adah said there were two ) , and a couple of acolytes . They followed the ancient road , turned off on a dirt track Fanny had scouted out the day before with the help of two black men who lived on an adjoining place . They parked . No one would have seen them . Like the road , the track was sunk deep between its shale banks . And who , in any case , would have been driving down old 61 at midnight ? There , deep in the night , they met the two black men . The men lit their torches ( flambeaux , Miss Adah called them-they were doubtless fat pine knots ) and led the procession in , across a pasture at a point where the **26;595;TOOLONG fence was half down . All they had to do was push the leaning post lower and step over the strands of wire . They entered the woods then , Miss Adah said , and made their way to the cemetery . <p> " Ca n't you picture it ? " she said . " Imagine ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaming ! Censers smoking .... " <p> Really ! I thought . Really ! <p> They did whatever needed to be done to help Dunny begin his journey from hell through purgatory toward heaven , and then they left . Later , doubtless , masses would be said for his soul . Candles would be lit . Money would change hands from time to time over the years . <p> " So now , " Miss Adah said-with considerable satisfaction , it seemed to me- " a piece of the Dunbar cemetery is Catholic . " <p> It strikes me that there are going to be confusions and frustrations in this tale regarding kinship and identity . For those who , unlike most southerners ( black and white ) , are not used to keeping lists of relatives in their heads , I append here for ready reference a partial list of characters : <p> Grandmother One-my maternal grandmother <p> Marian Davis-her sister-in-law , my great-aunt <p> Grandmother Two ( Nellie ) - my paternal grandmother <p> John-husband of Grandmother Two <p> Corinne-Grandmother Two 's sister <p> Julia Nutt-friend of Grandmother Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fanny-Dunbar 's wife I could n't wait to ask Grandmother One what she knew about this midnight invasion . <p> " I do n't believe it , " she said . " I just do n't believe it . She was the madwoman-Fanny . If Marian had known she was doing that , she 'd . . God knows what she 'd have done . " ( My grandmother often said Oh , Lord or Lord knows , but God ? Only when she was really talking about God . ) " God knows , " she said again . And then , " Of course we all knew she 'd come down here . That she wanted the grave blessed or consecrated , or whatever they do . Marian told me at the time . And then , afterwards , later , I knew she 'd put a stone-a slab covering the entire grave . ... Marian did n't object to that . Although . . . Dedicated by his loving wife , Fanny ? It 's clear what she meant to imply : You people buried him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and buy a marker for his grave . <p> " But **25;623;TOOLONG Dunbar cemetery ? As if it needed it ? And after forty years apart , with never a peep from her ? Without the faintest indication that . . . Not , of course , that there was any reason for her to stay in touch with him . " She shook her head and was quiet for a while , pressing her lips together now and again , as very old people do , as if biting off an invisible thread . <p> Now , in 1948 , her lids drooped heavily over milky , almost sightless eyes . But when she was young , I knew from her wedding photograph , her gaze had been skeptical , ironic , compelling a response . " Look at this ridiculous getup , " she seemed to say , gazing out of the picture . " What do you think of it ? " Now , though , she saw only shapes , used her voice to draw you in . Sitting on her front porch , across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among squat live oaks , she 'd listen for a familiar step , recognize her passing neighbors by their voices , call them in for a chat . <p> It was still true that nothing much escaped her . <p> Across the street a troop of children passed , followed by two sisters in dark blue habits , carried along by the white sails of their wimples , rosaries swinging from their belts . She heard the marching steps . " Children going to mass ? " <p> " I reckon so , " I said . <p> " Who knows why they separated in the first place , " she said . " Fanny and Dunbar . But whatever the reason , they were separated . Even if they were not divorced . And as for that , my dear , the Catholics did n't have a corner on staying married and making your own discreet arrangements . I 'd be the first to admit that . Nobody got divorced in those days . But Fanny and Dunbar were totally separated , totally . Two years after they married-they lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour , and then settled in Italy , so we heard-two years later he came back here without a word to anyone about what had gone wrong . Not a word that I ever heard . . " <p> " But if he was n't a Catholic . . . " <p> " Oh , I suppose he must have converted when he married her . There would n't have been the possibility of marriage otherwise , given her family . " She shrugged . " As you know , conversion would never be a matter of convenience in our family , but it must have been for him . He certainly , as far as I know , never went to mass once he escaped their clutches . And then ! For her to come back here after he died and . . I " <p> " But why should Aunt Marian care what Fanny did ? " I said . " What difference did it make ? " <p> " Ah , that 's a puzzle , is n't it ? Why ? What difference did it make ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living at The Forest when Dunny died , was she ? Julia was in charge . She made the arrangements . But regardless of that , for Fanny to come back-to imply . . . As if Dunny had wanted confession and a Catholic burial , as if he 'd called out for a priest when he was dying . You see ? Fanny , after forty years of living a life of ease in Florence-yes , Italy . She stayed on after he came home , spent her life abroad . " <p> " But why Miss Julia Nutt ? " I said . " Why was she in charge ? What was her connection with Mr. Marshall ? " <p> " And how long had he been dead ? At least a couple of years . Ridiculous ! Did they think God had been hanging around waiting for the grave to be blessed before he could decide what to do with Dunny ? " She laughed and shook her head . " Not that I have anything against the Catholics , " she said . " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could n't have lived across the street from the cathedral for eighty years and not had some fellow feeling for . . . But you can keep that under your hat when you 're out at Nellie 's . " And then , " Poor old Dunny , " she said . " For that matter , he probably needed all the blessing he could get . " <p> Maybe she said that and maybe she did n't . I suppose it may just be that I have the memory now of wanting to sympathize with Dunny , consigned to the Catholic hell he had n't thought of in decades , crushed under the slab set in place by the wife he had n't seen for forty years . <p> " As for Julia 's connection , " my grandmother went on , " she was with him when he died . She buried him . If he 'd wanted a priest , she 'd have called one for him . " <p> " Oh , " I said . Now I began to remember . It was at The Forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , before Jamie and Aunt Marian lived there . She and " Cousin " Dunny , sitting on the long , screened gallery when my other grandmother had taken us to visit . Maybe that 's where she was living when my father and his brothers lived at Longwood . But had n't I seen her at Longwood. too ? <p> " But why ? " I said again . " What are you talking about ? " <p> My grandmother 's voice has almost left me now , imprinted though it was on my brain over and over again for almost half a lifetime . She could n't carry a tune in a bucket , but there were lyric and dramatic qualities to her voice , a range in pitch when she was telling a story , an expressiveness .... Ah , she seemed to be saying , what I could tell you about this fascinating world ! Ah , the perfidy of itl The high drama ! The tragedy ! And oh , how ridiculous we all are with our pretensions , how base with our betrayals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even us . ) <p> There she sits , Grandmother One , in a green-painted , rush-bottomed rocking chair . It 's afternoon , and she 's had her bath , carefully arranged her sparse white hair like a cap over her balding scalp and put on one of those thin , flower-sprigged voile dresses that old ladies used to wear in the spring and summer . Soon her daughters , my two aunts , will be home from work , bringing the day 's gossip , but now she has plenty of time for me . <p> " Ah , Julia , " she says . " What 's the connection ? Get me a cold biscuit , darling , and a glass of sherry , and I 'll tell you . In the sideboard . Lefthand door . " <p> She nibbled at her biscuit , sipped her afternoon sherry , gave me a sidelong glance . " Julia lived out there with Dunny , " she said .

" And I think he looked after the cows . " <p> Saying cows implied something modest indeed , something far less lucrative than cattle . Well , I thought , that was the sort of thing people did in rural Adams County-never mind that he 'd been on the grand tour with his bride , settled in Florence ( in a palazzo ? ) . When he came back to Natchez , he helped Julia look after her cows . What to make of all this ? God knows , as my grandmother would say in moments of stress . <p> " But you must have seen him when Nellie took you out to visit Julia .

" <p> Here is Miss Julia coming to call on Grandmother Two . It 's four o'clock on a summer afternoon in the late ' 20s . <p> Curious how one has precise and vivid memories stamped on the gray cells-of people one has known only as friends of grown-up relatives , with whom one may never have had the least personal connection . I remember , for example , a friend of my aunt 's who wore extraordinary , brilliant spots of orange rouge , round as dollars , on her cheeks , applied over a base of powder white as a geisha 's face in a Gilbert and Sullivan opera . I remember her dumpy figure , her guttural voice , the mole on her chin , even her white tennis dress , as precisely as if she were my mother and I 'd begun to memorize her on the day of my birth . <p> And I remember Miss Julia Nutt just as vividly . <p> Here she is , coming to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards in those days . Ladies , even poverty-stricken ladies ( and gentlemen , too ) , continued to call . <p> I ca n't remember how she arrived . Did she have a car ? Did she drive it herself , or have a chauffeur ? In this strange world and time-the late ' 20s in the South-one might have a chauffeur whom one paid five dollars a week and keep . I have the impression that very poor white people might not be able to pay their taxes , but they could afford chauffeurs and cooks . Is that possible ? But . . . I do n't know-I recall that there were also very , very poor white people who had no chauffeurs , no cars even , who drove into town in their buggies to " call " or to shop . These people , however , were looked upon as curiosities . Perhaps they were just eccentric-opposed to peonage and the combustion engine . <p> I see them-Julia and Nellie-in the wide hall of my grandmother 's house . They are embracing , and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're moving toward the horsehair sofa in the parlor , then sitting side by side , bending toward each other , talking . In this memory I would have been seven or eight years old , and they would have been in their sixties-very old ladies in my view , and probably in their own , though my grandmother would live another twenty-five years . <p> I hear the murmur of their voices . This grandmother 's voice is softer , has a more limited range than the other 's . She , too , is dressed in one of those flower-sprigged old-lady dresses-hers is always lavender and white , because she stays to the end of her life in semi-mourning for my grandfather , who at this point has been dead for five or six years . ( Does anyone in the world besides me remember that lavender was the color for semi-mourning , put on after a year in black and two in black-andwhite ? ) <p> I 'm wandering . I want to tell about my memory of Miss Julia . <p> She 's not in mourning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't recall her dress . I see instead the delicate band of ecru lace around her throat and the hint of lace at her wrists . She is erect , sturdy , high-bosomed , hawknosed , wattled-that 's the detail that almost escaped me-her wattles halfconcealed by the lace . Her softly wrinkled face is dusted , like that of my aunt 's tennis friend , with white powder . No round spots of rouge on her cheeks , though . Just the faintest hint of a flush . ( I suppose I must have noticed these cosmetic details because they were unusual . Neither my grandmothers nor my mother wore rouge or lipstick : my grandmothers because it was not done by women of their generation , my mother because , she said , my father did n't like makeup . ) <p> I hear Julia 's voice . Husky . Does she smoke ? I believe she does . Yes . I see her fit a cigarette into a holder and light it . But mainly I remember that two-inch-wide band of ecru lace around her neck , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrists . <p> I have no memory of eavesdropping on their conversation . I may have begun to listen , lost interest , and fallen into a reverie of my own contriving . In my other grandmother 's house , conversations among grown people were dramatic . One listened . Drunken men staggered into her stories , flew into rages , tore up the very sheets on their beds or threw their shoes out the window . Gamecocks were killed by mistake and put into the Sunday gumbo . The levee broke and the cotton fields flooded . Grooms abandoned their brides at the altar . And there is this : stories happened to people you knew . I was left with the distinct impression that the roomer who shredded his sheets was frustrated because my grandmother , a young widow at the time , refused to marry him . <p> But this grandmother , Grandmother Two , inquired of her friend whether the cows were calving or whether the lespedeza had been planted . Had the late freeze ruined the plums and figs ? Would there be a pecan crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They were both farmers , after all : since my grandfather 's death , Grandmother Two had supervised the operation of their farm . If these were the subjects of conversation , I would doubtless have lost interest . <p> I want to go back now to that afternoon 's conversation with Grandmother One . I 've gotten her a second glass of sherry and ferreted out the bourbon bottle to fix myself a drink . <p> " They were third cousins , " she said . " Or fifth . I 'm not sure . You 're distantly related to Dunny , too , of course . But no connection with the Nutts . She and Dunny must have been cousins on the other side . But distant cousins . If they 'd been first cousins , almost like brother and sister , you know , there would never have been any talk . No one would dream that first cousins could . . . could . . . " She broke off . <p> " Do you mean they were lovers ? " <p> " That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge not that ye be not judged . They had separate quarters , of course . Or so people said . At both places . He had his own rooms . This is hearsay , my dear . We were never intimate . I 'm . . . Well , of course it is n't exactly hearsay . I 'm telling you what Marian observed at The Forest . But whatever the truth was , nobody called . " <p> " What about you ? " I said . <p> " We were never intimate , " she said again . " But it was not an issue with me . You know . None of my business . " <p> " But . . . Nobody called ? You said Grandmother used to take us out there to see her . And she did . I remember . " <p> " Oh , Nellie ! I 'm sure she never allowed a word spoken against Julia . Never . " <p> And I was immediately sure of that , too . No word of censure was ever spoken against friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew would ever have left his bride at the altar . He 'd sooner have had a heart attack and died . Not a year had passed since she had explained to me that a young cousin had not been to call for some months because he 'd been on vacation in New Mexico . In fact , as Grandmother One had already told me , he and his lady friend had gotten drunk one evening in the cemetery-a lovely spot to share a drink , the loveliest cemetery in Mississippi-had stripped off their clothes to make love among the tombstones , and been arrested for committing a public nuisance . He 'd lost his job . She 'd lost all her tennis students . Grandmother Two said he did n't come back from his vacation because he had found such a tempting opening out there he could n't refuse it . I 've forgotten what became of the lady friend . <p> Is there any point in digging up these ancient scandals ? Not only my grandmothers but those two insouciant lovers are long dead . <p> But they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making . They had to leave town because somebody caught them joyously fucking ( and on his very own cemetery lot ) in the middle of a beautiful , moonlit April night . <p> And Grandmother Two had to not know it happened . <p> Aside from that , what were the police doing harassing peaceful lovers in the middle of the night in the privacy of the cemetery ? <p> Grandmother One was still thinking about Julia . " I 'm not much of a caller , " she said . " You know very well that I ca n't drive and never could afford a chauffeur . Here I sit on my front gallery in the six hundred block of Main Street , across from the cathedral , no distance from the Presbyterian church and the building and loan and Britton and Koontz Bank . Everybody eventually passes the house , and they 're always welcome to come in and visit . " She sipped her sherry , raised her head as blind people often do , seeming to listen for some faint signal , or to sniff the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Julia and Dunny in the evenings quite often . " she said . " They were always fond of the young men . " <p> What to make of that ? <p> " Your father 's bachelor party , " she said . She said nothing else for a few minutes . <p> I waited . <p> " Your father 's bachelor party was held at Longwood . Even I took a dim view of that . " She 's speaking of the drunken brawl held for the groom on the eve of his wedding . She shrugged and smiled as if to say , " I did n't really . " But instead she said , " I did . " <p> The front gate creaked . " Ah , " she said , " do n't I hear the girls ? Yes . " The girls were my sixtyish aunts , coming home from their jobs as secretaries , one to the vice-president of a bank , the other in an insurance agency . <p> I was left to consider the implications of my father 's bachelor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandmother One had made a clear statement . She had consigned Julia to the category of women who entertain men but not ladies . Shades of Belle Watling . <p> I have n't done justice to the stories Grandmother Two used to tell  --  or rather read aloud to us children . True , they were not about real people ; there was never the baffling but fascinating glimpse into the crisisplagued world of our grown-up family . But all the same , they rivaled in thrills the tale of the roomer who tore up his sheets and threw his shoes out the window . <p> Grandmother Two 's characters were distant and mythical people , and her stories had shape-endings and , at least implicitly , morals . There was the Covenanter ancestor whose sister-when he fled her house , pursued by King Charles 's troops-concealed under her voluminous skirts the League and the Covenant signed in the blood of the dissenters . There were the two children who wandered away from their lonely forest homestead and were murdered by Indians . And there was the gypsy boy picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lap of a wilderness bandit from whom he was rescued by a pious country woman who promptly began to teach him his catechism . In one of these tales a stern father , crippled by gout , ca n't pursue his daughter and her forbidden lover when they flee like Lochinvar and his bride into the wild Mississippi night , moss blowing , limbs creaking , owls screaming in the darkness . But the storm pursues them-wind is precursor to downpour . Crossing the Homochitto River , the lovers are swept away in one of those flash floods that rush without warning out of the southern hills . <p> Sometimes the heroes and heroines are animals : a boy frog named Joe who repeatedly gets into trouble from which he is rescued by Mrs. Crow , a splendid elderly crow-lady in a bonnet and black shawl ; a trickster rabbit escaped from the circus , shivering under the Chickasaw-rose hedge ; a bear who has gnawed off his toe to escape a trap . <p> Vengeful Catholics . Stern fathers . Disobedient daughters . Murderous Indians . Animals escaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . These were Grandmother Two 's characters , and she thought about them , wrote down their stories , and read them to us on weekday afternoons after dinner or evenings at bedtime . <p> Sundays , after Sunday school and church and dinner ( Grandmother carving the leg of lamb ; dignified , officious Hampton , her chauffeur , now in his white waiter 's jacket , handing the biscuits and rice and butter beans , tapioca pudding for dessert ) , story-reading was strictly from the Bible or The Christian Observer . Dominoes and checkers , croquet sets and packs of cards had vanished on Saturday night into closets and drawers . The Sunday funnies were put away to be read on Monday . If we were staying with Grandmother Two , Mother usually fled with us after dinner to Grandmother One , where you could read the funnies , play Parcheesi , and go to the Prentiss Club for an afternoon swim . <p> Those old Covenanters might seem to me as made-up as Bluebeard , but I was aware that their heavy hands still pressed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month or so ago thinking about Julia and Dunbar and Nellie , I have gone back to Natchez . I 've gone to the cemeteries at The Forest and at Longwood . Julia , I 've discovered , is indeed buried at Longwood , just a short walk into the woods from that astonishing fivestoried octagonal mansion with its copper-colored dome and carved finial . She 's surrounded by her kin-parents and cousins and the two nephews who inherited the house and sold it to buy food and clothes and whiskey . <p> She is visited now by thousands of callers : tourists who come from all over the world to see the house-widely advertised as a gem of Sloane architecture-and who wander in the woods and visit the cemetery and pay their respects to the dead . <p> I 've looked at old photographs and gotten out boxes of letters . Photographs : in the one of Grandmother Two that I like best , she stands in the photographer 's studio , trim and narrow-waisted in a formal riding habit and top hat , a tasseled crop in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course she rode sidesaddle ) falls in graceful folds . The trim jacket is buttoned up to the barely visible starched collar of her blouse with eighteen fabric-covered buttons and fastened at the throat with what appears to be a silver brooch in the shape of a riding whip . Tendrils of dark , curly hair escape under the stiff brim of her hat . She is poised , self-possessed , gentle , a half-smile on her lovely , strong , intelligent young face . She ca n't be more than seventeen or eighteen . In another , she 's a married woman seated at a spinet surrounded by her four sons , who gaze with uniform wide-eyed solemnity sideways toward the photographer . Nellie . her sad face in profile , her hair piled high and twisted into a French knot , looks at her sons . She wears a high-necked blouse in the style of the time , with long , cuffed , leg-o ' - mutton sleeves . I can barely make out , propped on the lid of the spinet , a dim picture-it seems to be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lid are small bronze figures-one a mounted Roman general , the other a woman carrying a water pitcher on her shoulder . I deduce from the apparent ages of the boys that this photograph must have been made not long after the death of Nellie 's only daughter , Corinne , at the age of five . <p> I 've also seen a photograph of Julia as a young woman , standing next to Nellie in a large group of tennis players who are disposed about a lawn , some standing , some sitting , in front of a columned house . She holds a racquet in one hand and looks directly into the camera . But her face is blurred . I ca n't make out either the features or the expression . <p> I have read the letters exchanged between Nellie and John Ayres , her husband-to-be , during their courtship and engagement , and later , after their marriage , when for periods of weeks or months he was working in a commission merchant 's office in New Orleans and she was at home , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of a pregnancy ) or in the deep country on their farm . <p> Almost every one of the playful early letters refers to Julia : " My best friend , " or " Julia sends her love and a saucy message which I wo n't relay , " or " Julia 's lieutenant is here . " ( Or is gone , or came to call . ) Often in these letters she uses Julia or her sister Corinne as a surrogate for herself : " Corinne tells me to say that she longs to see you-hopes you 'll soon return to our little town . " Or " Julia sends you . . . " not just a saucy message , but sometimes even a kiss . " Julia , " she writes , " is n't the kind of girl to be deeply distressed about any man , I reckon . " Of herself in one of the early letters she writes , " I am a very cold woman and would not have you deceive yourself by thinking otherwise . " " My dear Mr. Ayres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and signs herself , " Your friend , Nellie Henderson . " Later she writes " My dear Jack , " but still signs herself , " Your friend . " <p> Almost from the beginning he is direct , passionate . " My darling Nellie , " he writes , " My own dear Nellie . " And " You can not imagine how much I love you , " and " I would not have you believe me perfect nor rich .... You would be all I would have to live and work for . " And ( perhaps after the cold woman letter ) " I love you too much to have you marry one you do not love and there is no sacrifice I would not make to save you from such an act . " <p> The formal games of courtship continue into the engagement . She pretends , for example , not to know why he asks for her hand size . ( Gloves , like candy and flowers , were acceptable gifts in those days from a man to a young lady . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a period in the middle from which no letters remain ; if he was in Natchez , maybe none were written ) , they are engaged and then married . " My dear Jack " becomes " My darling husband , " " My dearest Jack " ( this in a period when women customarily called their husbands Mister ) , and , to me even more moving , " My dear old man . " One deduces that the cold woman has melted . <p> Julia is still a presence in these later letters . Nellie takes the babies and goes to Longwood to spend the day . But the correspondence centers now on planting time and harvest , on the chickens , the turkeys , the cows ( Lillie Langtry , their soft-eyed Jersey , has calved ) , on the scarcity of money , on the children : " Richardson is asleep and Sister is rocking the baby . " And , overwhelmingly , on her loneliness when he is away : " I long for the day when you 'll never have to leave me again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nellie falls silent . What happened to the lieutenant ? Did she spurn him ? Did he abandon her ? Or was he , in fact , Dunbar Marshall ? I do n't know . But what happened eventually , as we know from Dunbar 's tombstone as well as from ancient gossip , is that he married Fanny Bullitt . <p> What I did n't know-what neither Miss Adah nor Grandmother One told me , what I found out when I began just this year ( 1994 ) looking at old records and writing about these lives-is that not only were Julia and Dunbar " distant cousins , " but Fannie and Julia were first cousins . <p> Now I am trying to fit this fact into my ancient romance . Did Fanny steal Julia 's lover away ? Is that the tragedy unrecorded in Nellie 's letters ? <p> As I gather the fragments of this story , I have a choice : I could invent-I am a novelist , after all , accustomed to inventing . I imagine that Fanny was yielding and soft and treacherous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could set her off against Julia , whom I remember so well as a sturdy , high-bosomed , hawk-nosed , deepvoiced old woman , and think of as the girl Nellie had called " not the kind . . . to be deeply distressed about any man , I reckon . " The temptation is seductive . How deeply I would like to be able to tell you of Fanny 's betrayal of her cousin , of Dunbar 's escape from a hateful marriage , of her refusal to divorce him , of the climax : Julia 's defiance of convention when she welcomes him to her house , her arms , her bed . And , finally , of how Fanny , after Dunny is dead , comes back to claim him , to put her name on his gravestone in a last , furious act of possession-how God and the Catholic church are mere excuses for the acting out of rage and jealousy and a rivalry begun , perhaps , when the two women were children . Julia was cleverer , more lovable , stronger , nobler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't resist it . <p> But this is fiction-romantic nonsense . All I know is that Dunny left his wife , came back to Adams County , moved somehow into Julia 's life , began " looking after her cows " and occupying quarters in her house . I have heard that no one called except Nellie and the young men . And I know that , in defiance of her church and his marriage vows , they committed themselves to each other and for a lifetime honored that commitment . <p> Yes , her church . Like Fanny , Julia was born a Catholic . <p> Later there are wills from which one can perhaps make reasonable deductions . There was Longwood-and the eventual disposal of Longwood must have been on a number of minds . It belonged to Julia , and its value as a curiosity , as a family property , as a tourist attraction ( toward the end of her life when Natchez houses were beginning to be famous ) would have been evident to the nieces and nephews who inherited it at her death and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recall , was living there as a kind of caretaker and guide during my adolescence . One concludes , therefore , that Julia did not fall out with her family to the extent of disinheriting them . Perhaps , after all , they-the nephews in any case-were among " the young men " who continued to call . <p> Dunny left a will , too , as I discovered while nosing around the chancery clerk 's office . His estate was modest , but not so modest as I had expected , thinking of him as the man who looked after Julia 's cows  --  and her other needs . Some twenty thousand dollars in securities went to his daughter . Daughter ? Where did she come from ? No one had mentioned her . She and Fanny will remain shadows to the end of this story . <p> As I 've observed , Dunbar is not mentioned in Julia 's will . But surprisingly ( to me ) , my great-aunt Marian and her husband are : the will states that Marian and Jamie are honorable and trustworthy people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nor is Julia mentioned in Dunbar 's will . It is impossible for me to resist the supposition that the two of them talked to each other of their wills , that perhaps they decided together to let community and family finally have their due . <p> Here is another vivid memory from my childhood . It 's summer , and as usual we are visiting Grandmother Two . I see myself sitting beside her in the backseat of her old black Buick . At this point , if I am a small child , the Buick is not very old . Grandmother Two did n't lose her husband 's money until the failure of the Hibernia Bank early in the Great Depression . Thereafter her car got older and older . Hampton 's chauffeur 's uniform and the car 's paint faded together from black to an acid , purplish green ; but he managed to keep the car alive for years . In any case , Hampton is driving us to town . Now he has parked the car in front of the columned temple of Britton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed Grandmother out . She is wearing her white-and-lavender , flower-sprigged summer dress and white cotton gloves and is carrying a little white crocheted drawstring pouch-her reticule . Then we are at home again . She must have cashed a check to pay Hampton , or Ida , the cook , or the vegetable man-or all three . For some reason money is about to change hands , and she must count it out and handle it . <p> We are in the bathroom now , and I am standing by the basin watching a process that takes place every time money comes into the house . <p> " Why ? " I am asking . <p> She has removed her gloves . Her arms are bare to the elbows . She is bent seriously over the basin , but she turns toward me to answer my question , to tell me about germs and filth . <p> She is washing the money . <p> A few dimes and quarters and fifty-cent pieces lie glinting at the bottom of the basin . A number of bills ( ones and fives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were scarcer in those days than hundreds would be now ) float limply above the coins , and Grandmother picks them up and soaps them and rubs them together . She stirs the water , and the coins clink against each other . She drains the basin . She rinses the coins and bills and lays them on a towel to dry . <p> Grandmother Two is not crazy . She is a sane and gentle lady who manages a farm ( her husband and sister-in-law are dead now ) and a complex household consisting of her sister , her servants , and , this summer day , three grandchildren and a pregnant daughter-in-law . ( I 'm choosing for this memory the summer of my brother 's birth . ) Dinner is served every day at one . Hampton puts on his waiter 's jacket and hands the cornbread , removes the plates , brings in the dessert ( tapioca pudding again ) . After dinner we may play a game of casino , or Grandmother may read us one of her stories . Or we may wind the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " Humoresque . " Or pretend that the scatter rugs in the long , cool hall are pirate ships and mount an invasion of the parlor . At four Hampton will close the downstairs shutters and depart . Suppertime will come , and Grandmother and Mother will make tomato sandwiches and cut us each a piece of Ida 's delicious sponge cake . <p> Nevertheless , it 's true that she washes every coin and bill that passes through her hands . Can money be washed clean ? Can we drive the moneychangers from the temple ? <p> Has this anything to do with Julia ? With the cousin who went permanently vacationing in New Mexico ? <p> Here is one of Grandmother Two 's stories . This one she did not write down . But she told it to us-and not only she but my great-aunt , her sister Corinne . And since it was told in turn to my older sister , my younger sister , my brother , and me , as we each got old enough to hear and understand it , I heard it many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the link between her written-down stories and a world in which every coin must be washed before it can be touched . <p> In the early nineteenth century , Samuel Brooks and his wife Mary had two daughters ( or family tradition says they did ; I have n't checked the cemetery for their stones ) . Mr. Brooks was the first American mayor of Natchez , and another legend has it that in his Presbyterian zeal he closed down all the taverns and whorehouses and " gambling dens " of Natchez-Under-the-Hill ( as notorious along the river in its time as the stews of London ) and that the gamblers and pimps and prostitutes and riverboat men marched on his house to rout him out and force him to rescind his order , or else to kill him . One family myth ( so bizarre that it may be true ) is that a rock crashed through an upstairs window , and when Mrs. Brooks looked out and saw the mob , she began to scream . She screamed and screamed ( rocks flying , presumably , windows shattering ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bled to death . Family tradition does not record whether Mr. Brooks rescinded his order . <p> Never mind about that . The story I want to tell is about the daughters , who , to make a long story short , were to attend their first ball as young ladies , escorted , as was customary in those days , by their parents . <p> I think of Tolstoy 's joyous young heroines , doomed also to undergo great trials , of Katya and Natasha at their first balls ; and I think of my own first evening wrap-a scarlet woolen cape with gold-braid frogs on the shoulders , a dramatic cape that swept the floor when I made my entrance at a dance . <p> So : gowns had been ordered-trom Worth-from Paris ! I seem to recall ; but I must have made that up . The silks and braid , the velvets and peau de soie and moire taffeta probably came up on a riverboat from New Orleans , and the seamstress , perhaps , was " French " -a mulatto slave woman . Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at needlework , as my own Grandmother One was . <p> The young ladies came down . I pictured them , as the tale was told , sweeping down the broad staircase in my grandmother 's house in town , stairs that descended into a high-ceilinged parlor and airy open hallway . But they lived , in fact , in an earlier , Spanish-period house with low ceilings and narrow , enclosed stairs like a ship 's companion . <p> Father and Mother awaited them in the drawing room , admired their gowns , had them turn round to be inspected on all sides . Mother adjusted the lace of a shawl , tucked in an errant curl . Did she know what was about to happen ? Surely not . <p> And then the old man-the father , the Presbyterian elder , the sadist-folded his arms and addressed them . Was his voice gentle ? His mien fatherly ? " And now , young ladies , " he said . " Go upstairs . Take off your ball gowns and go to bed . You must learn to bear disappointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two 's grandmother . Who else could have passed along this story , made this comment on the character of Mr. Brooks-her father ? <p> Here I think about the lives of women in that long-ago time when marriage was the only career open to ladies . I think of all those real and fictional nineteenth-century tyrannical fathers , and I begin to think of my grandmother 's maiden sister and maiden sister-in-law , who for their own reasons used their own stratagems to avoid marriage-and stratagems they did have-or Corinne did , I know , because my father has told me about them . <p> These two women led busy , active , devout lives . One had her own money-half of the inheritance that enabled Grandfather to buy the house in town-and she helped him run the struggling farm , which belonged to them jointly . Often she stayed there alone , far out in the country , a mile from the nearest white family , when Grandfather was away and Grandmother Two was pregnant and staying in town with her parents . The other , Corinne , taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of course Sunday school ) . She gardened and called and read . ( By the time I came along , her favorite author was Edgar Rice Burroughs , her hero John Carter , Warlord of Mars . ) She looked after her aging parents and helped her sister raise four boys , all of whom regarded her , I know , as a second mother . <p> I think about them-these women-and I think about my grandmother and the lovely letters addressed to Dearest Jack , to My darling husband , My dear old man . <p> And I think about the courage and passion of Julia Nutt . <p> What 's essential , too , is to remember and understand , if we can , the depth and conviction and rootedness of Grandmother Two 's piety and the virulence of ancestral hatred of the Catholic Church . <p> I see again , on the sewing table by her wicker rocker , her worn Bible , the gilt mostly gone from the page edges and from the letters stamped on its limp leather cover ; and I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pray . We were not allowed to disturb her then . <p> I recall the reading aloud of Bible stories on Sunday evening  --  stories of how Elisha called out the bears to eat the children who made fun of him ; of how Jehovah drowned the armies of Pharaoh ; of how , over and over again , the Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord and were delivered into the hands of the Ammonites or the Moabites or the Philistines . And later how , when God relented , the Israelites fell on them ( whoever they were ) and slew them every one . <p> But Ruth , too , and Naomi . Ruth , who said , " Entreat me not to leave thee . " I recall again the mention in the Henderson Bible of those long-dead dissenters who " suffered much in the persecution of the church .... " <p> And I remember my visit years ago to Scotland , remember seeing the wreckage , the devastation of ancient abbeys and churches , the statues of saints left noseless and sometimes headless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier to Italy , had seen San Clemente and San Pietro in Vinculo and Santa Costanza and the duomos in Florence and Siena-the glittering mosaics , the carved pulpits , the great silver candelabra-and also the small , homely , pious men and women going about their tasks-sowing seed , plowing , baking , building-on the panels around the campanile in Florence . <p> And then , later , in Scotland , to see the awful noseless faces , the ruined abbey walls .... Ah , they were jagged stones in the middle of my life , even far as I believed myself to be from all those ancient passions . <p> Nellie was born a Henderson , a collateral descendant of Alexander Henderson , the Scottish divine who debated and prayed with Charles I for days , seeking his renunciation of the Catholic faith , and who , when he failed , turned the king over to Cromwell , " to be murdered , " as Miss Adah said . Henderson , some church historians record , took to his bed afterward and never got up . Seven days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his death . <p> For Nellie , the Covenanter has signed the League and the Covenant in his blood . His sister has concealed it on her person . The runaway lovers must drown . The straying children must be murdered . The young ladies must learn to bear disappointment . <p> I come now to Julia 's death and burial and the mystery that surrounds them . <p> She lived only two years after Dunny : both died relatively young  --  in their early sixties . I think she must have moved back to Longwood when he died ; that may be why I remember climbing among the joists and rafters there . Perhaps she gave up farming , since she no longer had him to help her with the cows . In any case , the snapshot of my sister and me on Jamie 's donkey tells me that by the time I was ten or so , Jamie and Marian lived at The Forest . I was ten in 1931 , the year after Dunny 's death , the year before Julia 's . <p> But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyterian churches played , or did n't play , in both these deaths-the funerals , and Nellie 's part in them . <p> Remember that Julia and Dunny-one born into the Catholic Church , the other a convert " for convenience " during his brief marriage-lived all their adult lives in what their church regarded as mortal sin . <p> Who decided to bury Dunny at The Forest ? Surely it was Julia , not Marian . Who conducted the service ? Not a priest , according to Miss Adah . Marian said he had had a Presbyterian funeral and if that was not good enough to get him into heaven , he could just go the other way . Did she say this out of loyalty to Julia and Dunny , out of knowledge of their private convictions ? Or possibly-this has just occurred to me  --  she knew the history of his marriage and took genuine pleasure in foiling his wife , whom she believed to be the villain of the piece . <p> And then : Presbyterian ? Where would Julia have found , in that rigid world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service over her fallen-away Catholic lover ? <p> There are no answers to these questions , but they are enough to set the novelist off in half a dozen different directions . <p> Perhaps-can it be ? - there was only Julia following his coffin to the dark , crumbling cemetery , only Julia standing by as the grave was filled . Or perhaps Nellie was with her . It may be that Nellie brought her worn Bible and read a psalm and said a prayer . It has struck me more than once , thinking about these lives , that Julia , out of deep knowledge of her friend 's character , may , to shield her from distress , have concealed from Nellie the depth of hers and Dunny 's indifference to what anybody 's church said or believed or attempted to enforce in the community they lived at the edge of . She was never " the kind of girl to be deeply distressed about any man . " Or about any church ? Or community ostracism ? Not those either , perhaps . But about her friend 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . <p> Again I must resist making up their story . <p> Two years passed . Julia died . Her funeral was held in my grandmother 's parlor . It was conducted by a priest . But of course ( outside the church , in a Protestant house ) , no mass could be said . <p> How do I know this ? I know it only because my mother chanced to tell me-years after my conversation with Grandmother One about the scandal of Julia and Dunny 's life together . Such a funeral was strange enough for her to remark on it , to speculate about why , to suggest that Julia , because of her life , was denied burial from the cathedral . ( We lived at the time in a small town in a neighboring state , and from what my mother said , neither she nor my father was privy to the arrangements or went to the funeral . ) " That must have been the only time a priest ever entered your grandmother 's house , " she said . <p> A priest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believable even for a moment that after Dunny 's death Julia went back into the Catholic Church , believable that she could call her whole life a sin and do penance for it ? That would be one explanation , would n't it , for the priest ? But such a thing is not believable , and for more than speculative reasons . If she had gone to confession , if she had been absolved , the lost lamb returned to the fold , she would have been buried from the cathedral with a proper mass . <p> " I 've heard of cases like that in those days , " a priest friend of mine said when I asked him to speculate about what might have happened . " If the dead woman was known to be an unrepentant sinner , and church burial was out of the question , some kind father might be willing to sneak in the back door and say a prayer over the body-wherever it was . No . It is n't surprising . " <p> " What 's surprising is who called him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a priest ? Did honor somehow require it ? Or could she find no one else , no one in her own or any other church to stand beside her and say a prayer at her friend 's coffin . <p> I am sure now that I remember my grandmother and Julia-and Dunny , too-on the gallery at The Forest on a long , hot summer afternoon . I recall an embrace and then the two women in intimate , quiet conversation . I hear their soft voices , Julia 's pitched a shade lower than my grandmother 's , the voices , it seems now , of ghosts , alive only in my head and only for the time left to me to remember them . I remember the call and response of those voices as I might remember music-the oboe making room for the flute and then meditatively answering ; and , like oboe and flute , they speak with deep emotion , but wordlessly . <p> Dunny sits a little apart from the women , dressed in shabby khaki pants and a collarless shirt . Is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission ? Hampton , I think , sits in the kitchen . I hear his deep , officious voice , condescending as a tuba . He too is in quiet conversation , with whoever presides over Julia 's household . <p> The evening draws in . My sister and I come back from exploring the graveyard and the ruined foundation of the old house . I hear the locusts ' stridulent , passionate calls rise and fall , as I have heard them all my life from the tree-shadowed galleries of the South . <p> Does it matter at all whether I recall or imagine this scene ? There they are . I know they are there , the three of them together , making their mysterious music . I want to convey the quality of their lives , of their friendship , but I can not . The secrets of a lifetime stand between me and them . <p> Instead I keep returning in my mind to one of the last times I spoke with Grandmother Two . She was ninety-four . Afterward I saw her only when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front door to see me out . Jintzy , the black sitter who looked after her those last feeble years , alert to prevent a fall , hovered in the background . Grandmother steadied herself on my arm . I bent and kissed her crumpled tissue-paper cheek , told her I 'd come again soon . <p> " You 're married , are n't you ? " she said anxiously . And then , " Of course . You were married here . I remember now . " <p> " Yes , " I said . <p> " All those camellias , " she said . " I remember all those beautiful camellias . " <p> " Yes . January . They were in full bloom . " <p> She gripped my arm with a strong old claw . " Have lots of children , darling , " she said . " Have lots of children . " <p> We were indeed married in her house . I came down the stairs in an ivory satin gown and sweeping veil of peau de soie , as I had so often imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball . <p> Lots of children ? Grandmother was confused . I already had three sons . <p> But .... Perhaps she was going back to the joyous and difficult and tragic years when her own boys were growing up , when her daughter died . Perhaps she was still wondering and grieving for her sister Corinne 's single life . Or perhaps she was thinking of Julia , who never had a child , could never have had a child . <p> When I saw her last , propped on a high hospital bed , dying of pneumonia- " the old man 's friend , " as people used to say-she was barely conscious , murmuring , whispering something I could not make out . Jintzy sat nodding , half-asleep , in a chair against the wall . Corinne sat in the brown wicker rocker with a Bible in her lap . She was reading aloud . All the time I stood by the bed she continued to read , or sometimes , lifting her ancient , ravaged , tear-streaked face , to repeat from memory : " Hear my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto thee . Hide not thy face from me .... " <p> " Juh . . . juh . . . juh . . . " my grandmother was whispering . " Juh . . . juh . . . juh . . " Hardly more than a breath . <p> " . . and my days are like a shadow that declineth ; and I am withered like grass . . . " <p> Over and over again : " Juh . . . juh . . " <p> " So the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord .... " <p> Jack ? Her darling Jack ? Her dear old man ? Or Julia ? <p> But no , it was Jintzy for whom she called , when she finally spoke . " Jintzy , " she said . " Jintzy , Jintzy , Jintzy , Jintzy . " <p> For the rest she was silent still . <p>
