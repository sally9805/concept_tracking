<p> Americans in the early years of the 20th century did n't exercise like we do today , but that 's not to say they did n't exercise . They did , probably more than you think . They just did n't call it exercise . In those days , it was more commonly referred to as scratching out a living . <p> Times have changed since then . Oh , how they 've changed . We 're not the rural nation we were at the turn of the last century . These days , we 're one big , happy global village . More and more , we earn our livings not with a good horse and a sharp plow , as many of our great-grandfathers did , but with a mouse pad and a keyboard . <p> Not surprisingly , our fingers are leaner and meaner than ever . Why , they can glide over those keys like Astaire and Rogers used to cut the rug and Willie Mays used to play center field . <p> Question is , what about our other parts ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we claim to be , as all those government agencies tell us we ought to be ? <p> We sure try . There 's no extreme some Americans wo n't go to to get in shape . We jog , we swim , we hoop and we hike . We squat , we bench , we downhill and we cross-country . We buy Air Jordans , Nordic Tracks , Ab Rollers and Universal Gyms . We roller blade , we line dance , we sweat to the oldies and we try to keep pace with Jane Fon da . We 've endured the Fat-Burning Workout , the 12-Month Total Body Workout and the Bathing Suit Workout . We do Jazzercise , Tae-Bo and cardio kickboxing . We 've even done the impossible in our neverending quest to be fit . We 've made a star out of Richard Simmons . <p> We do all those things , every week if not every day , but still the question remains : Do we do enough ? As we turn the page on the most enlightened century since the dawn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fonda is in great shape , but the rest of us , for the most part , are fitness wannabes . <p> Professional and college athletes are bigger than ever , and so is the average American . But the fact is , too many of us are bigger in all the wrong places . According to the latest figures from the Atlanta-based Center for Disease Control and Prevention , Americans are fatter than ever . The percentage of obese Americans - defined as being at least 30 percent over their ideal body weight - rose to 17.9 percent in 1998 from 12 percent in 1991 , an increase of 50 percent . <p> It 's true . Despite all we do , Americans as a whole are losing the battle of the bulge . We 're more inclined to stop at the Golden Arches than Gold 's Gym . We prefer 24hour drive-up windows to 24-hour Fitness Centers . We spend more time in chat rooms than weight rooms . <p> Oh , sure , we all want to be like Mike , but most of us would prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-pack and a bag of nachos within arm 's reach . <p> It 's not that we do n't want to get in shape . We 've just got other things on our minds . For the majority of us , exercise is a figurative term . We 're too busy running the rat race , too absorbed with chasing the almighty buck , to go walking , much less running . Heck , we do n't even get out of our comfy chairs any more to change the channel . Those svelte fingers of ours take care of that little detail , too . <p> ' We pay lip service to fitness , ' said Dr. Jay Coakley , a professor of sports sociology at the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs . ' Most people you talk to say , ' Oh yeah , I do this , I do that . ' But you ask people , ' Did you do it yesterday ? ' and what you find is that the data is very much different . It 's easier to get honest answers on questionnaires about sex than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Coakley , is how little we do despite how much we know . The benefits of ex ercise and fitness have long since been established , as have the health risks associated with a sed entary lifestyle . Yet the numbers suggest beyond the shadow of a doubt that , when it comes to break ing a sweat , people talk a good game instead of playing one . <p> ' I 'm really confused by a lot of the data , ' said Coakley . ' We 're much more aware of fat and all the things we should be doing , but the obesity data is going through the roof . We 're not only sitting , we 're eating fast food more than ever . We 're operating on schedules that preclude or inhibit us from prepar ing food we know we should be eat ing . So our knowledge is greater than ever , but putting the knowl edge into action in our lives does n't match what you would expect . ' <p> Some more numbers to sink your teeth into instead of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 1996 Surgeon General 's Report on Physical Ac tivity and Health , 60 percent of the country 's adults do n't achieve the recommended amount of physical activity , and 25 percent are n't physically active at all . And keep in mind , if anything , as Coakley suggests , those numbers are understated . <p> Before you ask , it 's not like the recommended amount of activity entails running marathons or try ing to make the Olympic swim ming team . <p> The report defines moderate physical activity as ac tivity that uses 150 calories of en ergy per day , or 1,000 calories per week . Some examples of such ac tivity : walking briskly for 30 min utes , swimming laps for 20 min utes , washing and waxing a car for 45-60 minutes , and pushing a stroll er 1 1/2 miles in 30 minutes . <p> Walking for 30 minutes ? Rolling junior through the park for a halfhour ? Seems like light duty , but at least 60 percent of us , and proba bly more , are n't doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , we want to look like Christie Brinkley and Chuck Nor ris . We know that folks do n't dig love handles . We 're well aware of all those reports from the feds on the infinite wonders of exercise . But still , no matter that the ad slo gan says , we just do n't do it . Not enough , anyway . <p> If only the report from the sur geon general stopped there . You read on and the picture of fitness in America gets even uglier . More than 60 million of us are over weight , and it 's easy to see why . Even when we 're at our peaks physically , we do n't exercise enough . According to the report , enrollment in high school phys ed classes dropped to 25 percent in 1995 from 42 percent four years earlier . The report also revealed that , during the average school week , only 19 percent of high school students are physically ac tive for 20 minutes or more in phys ed classes . <p> More daunting numbers : Accord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of American men and 55 percent of American women older than 25 are obese or overweight , the highest figures ev er recorded . <p> Perhaps the most troubling as pect of all is that we used to exer cise more . At least the surveys in dicated we did . According to Dr. Kenneth Cooper , whose 1968 book , ' Aerobics , ' helped launch the jog ging craze , 59 percent of the popu lation in 1984 claimed to be in volved in some sort of regular aerobic activity . An estimated 34 million Americans claimed to be regular joggers in ' 84 , a figure that 's dwindled to about 20 million . <p> ' We 've lost the enthusiasm we had in the ' 60s and ' 70s , ' said Coo per . ' We 're not wearing out , we 're rusting out . People are dying pre maturely and 75 percent of it is the result of an unhealthy lifestyle . We 're going to have to stop and re group . In the first 10 years of the next millennium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> Dr. Art Dickinson , an emeritus professor of kinesiology at the Uni versity of Colorado , was convinced in the mid- ' 60s , when the early ba by boomers were starting college , that America was on a steady course toward general fitness . No more . To hear Dickinson tell it , we had our opportunity and blew it . <p> ' Back in those years , I felt , ' Hey , as soon as we get one generation hooked on physical activity , then their kids are going to do it , and their kids are going to do it , " Dickinson said . ' But I was wrong . It did n't carry over . I really felt it was unavoidable , that we would have a very active population , but it has n't turned out that way . I 'm disappointed . ' <p> It 's not like there is n't a large segment of the American popula tion out there huffing and puffing . You may well be reading this after your 6 a.m. jog , something genera tions past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the middle stages of the century , when sol diers returned from World War II or Korea hopelessly hooked on ni cotine , people were more inclined to have a morning cigarette and a bottomless cup of coffee before heading off to their blue-collar worlds . <p> The paradox in all this is that the athletes we watch on our big screens are bigger , faster and stronger than ever , to say nothing of leaner , meaner and quicker . This is n't your father 's sports world . Take major league baseball , for instance . Today 's shortstops are typically bigger and stronger than cleanup-hitting first basemen of the ' 50s . Or the NFL , which has one team , the Denver Broncos , without a 300-pound starter in its offensive line . <p> It 's a far cry from the days when jogging was called running slowly , Chuck Taylor was the only name on a pair of sneakers , and the only weightlifting athletes did was 12-ounce curls at the corner tavern . Broncos scouting consultant Jerry Frei remembers those days . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coached at Oregon from 1955-71 . <p> ' It 's impossible to recognize the game , ' said Frei , whose staff at Oregon included future NFL head coaches John Robinson , George Seifert and Gunther Cunningham . ' In my day , you looked at people who fooled with weights as being very strange . Being muscle-bound was a negative . The term people used was ' country strong . ' Back then , the economics were such that you were liable to have a physical job . You were either out throwing hay bales or you worked in a cannery . You did n't get into playing shape until you came into camp . Now , it 's year-around weight training . It 's the only way you can compete . ' <p> Former Broncos defensive line coach Stan Jones , a Hall of Fame lineman for the Bears in the ' 50s , was one of the first NFL players to regularly lift weights . He owes his devotion to pumping iron to the fact that he was raised near York , Pa. , home of the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I started lifting in high school in 1945 , ' said Jones . ' The big thing in those days was to overcome all the negative stuff built up in people 's minds about weightlifting . When you heard the term ' muscle-bound , ' you thought of somebody who was Narcissistic , who liked to look in the mirror . There was also a fear of rupturing yourself . You look at all that 's changed since I played , it 's amazing we did n't kill ourselves . I remember they 'd never let us have water at practice . It 's a wonder our livers did n't give out from all those salt pills we took . ' <p> It 's not a natural evolution , this movement toward bigger and fas ter athletes . It 's been accelerated by year-around weight training , better nutrition and body-building supplements , most of which did n't come into vogue until the ' 90s . If there 's a poster boy for today 's professional athlete , it 's Mark McGwire , whose devotion to weightlifting and androstenedione attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just how much bigger is today 's athlete than the ones from genera tions past ? Consider this : There were no 300-pound players on NFL rosters in 1976 . In 1986 , there were 13 . By 1996 , there were 178 . Or take the case of Frei 's alma mater , Wisconsin , which three years ago fielded an all-300-pound offensive line for the first time in college football history . <p> The University of Nebraska is probably the most famous school in the country for its offensive line men . These days , the Cornhuskers routinely line up four or five 300-pounders to protect their quarter back . In 1966 , their offensive line weighed , from tackle to tackle , 228 , 215 , 223 , 205 and 264 . Take away the biggest of the bunch and you 've got your average halfback in today 's NFL . <p> Remember the Broncos ' famous Orange Crush defense ? It had two players who weighed more than 250 pounds - Barney Chavous , who was listed at 6-foot-3 , 252 , and Rubin Carter , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Broncos ' starting defensive tackles are Keith Traylor , who stands 6-3 and weighs 310 , and Trevor Pryce , 6-6 , 295 . <p> Amazing as it seems , the Broncos did n't hire their first **25;1515;TOOLONG coach until the early ' 80s . The move came more than 25 years after Louisiana State University hired Alvin Roy as the first strength coach in American sports . Roy , who ran a gym in Baton Rouge , La. , before being hired by LSU coach Paul Deitzel , was the first to make the connection between strength and speed . Before that , there was widespread apprehension about being too muscular . <p> Jones was in the distinct minority . He had the foresight to realize that weightlifting could make him a better player . At 255 pounds , he was one of the few NFL players to eclipse the 250 barrier in the ' 50s . He joined Lou Saban 's Broncos coaching staff in the late ' 60s , when the team weight room was n't really a weight room at all . Glorified broom closet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of weights sitting in a corner , ' said Jones . ' Guys used them once in a while , but it was nothing like it is today . Some guys would ask me about it , so I kind of got delegated to work with them . Lou did n't want it . He 'd say , ' I hate that weightlifting . Every time I walk by and they 're lifting weights , they 're breathing heavy . ' I 'd say , ' Well , Lou , I 'll tell them not to do that . " <p> These days , every college and pro team has a strength-and-condi tioning coach , most of whom have degrees in some aspect of physiolo gy . Not only that , they share infor mation with other members of their fraternity , leaving today 's athletes on the cutting edge of fit ness technology . If there 's an inno vative technique or nutritional sup plement that 's working for one team , the competition invariably finds out about it . And eventually , word trickles down to the colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 300-pound lineman during his days as the Broncos ' strength-and-condi tioning coach in the mid- ' 80s and early ' 90s . Now that Miller has moved on to the Atlanta Falcons , they 're the rule rather than the ex ception . <p> ' The biggest factor in all these big guys is that everyone shares in formation now , ' said Miller . ' The world is a lot smaller place these days . There 's so much structure now . The high school programs are unbelievable . Those coaches have learned from the colleges , and the colleges have learned from the NFL . ' <p> Those high school and college athletes do n't just want to be like today 's pros . They want to be paid like them , too . They want their own poster , their own endorsement deals , their own shoe line . Sure , it 's unrealistic to think it would ever happen , but there 's no denying that the incredible money associated with today 's sports world has serv ed to motivate kids to get bigger , faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seen the evolution . He came up to the big leagues dur ing an era when ballplayers sel dom , if ever , pumped iron . As he got older , he started to see his younger teammates hitting the weights . Now that he 's retired , he sees teenagers bulking up before they ever get to college or the mi nor leagues , much less to the ma jors . <p> ' Is money the driving force for these kids ? ' said Hurdle . ' Let 's look at the other side . What else would be the driving force ? Why do people play the lottery ? For the ed ucation system or the state parks ? I do n't think so . ' @p#
