The Caledonian Canal connects the North Sea with the Atlantic-and runs straight through some of Scotland 's most storied lochs. // At Inverness , the Caledonian Canal is already well above the River Ness , which flows close by in the valley below . In the distance , the mountains rise on each side , wearing shawls of snow above their flanks of heather and gorse . We round a corner and the chilly expanse of Loch Ness itself , 24 miles long and gouged deeply into the Western Highlands by ancient glaciers , spreads before us . But , while the mountains are breathtaking , our eyes tend to focus on the waters . Will we see the Monster , so sweetly named Nessie ? The mystery , the myths , the legends of this most famous of the Scottish lakes are palpable . The imagination feeds easily , readily on these dark waters . Halfway up the loch , where the brooding Castle Urquhart stands guard , the sense of history and mystery is complete . It is here , at Drumnadrochit , that most sightings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centre is now located . The first sightings were made in 565 A.D. and every year more sightings or curious ripples on the water are still reported . Scotland is a country full of romance and nowhere is this more evident than here . The best way to experience the full wonder and beauty of the region is to travel by boat along the Caledonian Canal which links the Atlantic Ocean with the North Sea . When the last ice age receded from Britain 10,000 years ago , it left behind a deep valley through the mountains of Scotland . Called the Great Glen , it was a lowland route that figures strongly in Scottish history . It was near here that the Battle of Culloden was fought , where the massacre of Glen Coe took place and where Bonnie Prince Charlie fled into exile . If that is not enough history for you , then think of the long Scottish tradition of creating the best whiskey in the world and the legend of the Loch Ness Monster . It has been posited that these two may be associated . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a famous engineer , Thomas Telford , who conceived the idea of linking these to create a water route across Scotland , saving ships from the treacherous seas around the northern tip . Construction began in 1805 , given impetus by a need to provide quick passage from the North Sea to the Atlantic for navy ships in the Napoleonic wars . The Caledonian Canal was a major engineering feat , taking ships up to the summit level in Loch Oich , 106 feet above sea level , and down again . At Banavie at the western end , Neptune 's Staircase is a flight of eight locks that takes the canal down to sea level and out into the Atlantic . Wild and magnificent Today , the Caledonian Canal is still used by fishing boats and small commercial ships , but its main function is leisure , attracting visitors from all over the world to see the wild and magnificent scenery-not to mention a possible glimpse of Nessie . The best way to experience the glories of the canal is by cruising on it . Caley Cruisers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ours was a brand-new 35foot motoryacht with the luxury of bow and stern thrusters to help in maneuvering in the locks . Photograph LOCH TO LOCK : Waiting for a fishing boat to clear Laggan Locks // We chose to moor , our first night , on the south side of the loch at Foyers . The Falls of Foyers , about one mile from the pier , were immortalized in verse by Robert Burns , but on a practical note there is a hotel that provides wonderful food and one of widest selections of malt whiskey I have seen . You are thankful it is downhill back to the boat . In the morning , the distant blue mountains turned to brown and green as the far end of Loch Ness approached with St. Benedict 's Abbey silhouetted against the hills . Originally a fort , the abbey is now a school run by Benedictine monks and has a commanding view of the loch . Alongside is the entrance to the canal section linking Loch Ness to Loch Oich , and the flight of five locks that run upwards like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ever-helpful lock keepers swiftly guide you through , and then the scenery changes : The mountains are still there , but close by the land levels out with a golf course and farmland , the latter dotted with the famous highland cattle and sheep . History is never far away , with the top locks at Cullochy marking the place where the troops rested after the Battle of Culloden . The white cottages contrast beautifully with the splendor of the scenery , and it is not easy to concentrate on driving the boat with so much to see . Highland specialties We passed through the swing bridge that carries the main Inverness-Fort William road along the Glen and then out into shallow Loch Oich where treecovered islands seem to float on the water . The channel was clearly marked by buoys , but you need concentrate on navigation . The ruins of Invergarry Castle are hidden among the trees on the north bank . A jetty here is a good place to stop to sample the traditional highland hospitality of the Invergarry Castle Hotel , where you can try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scottish country house . A " wee dram " helps with the degustation , as well . The Well of the Seven Heads at the head of the loch points the way into Laggan Avenue , a tree-lined section of canal where once again the pronounced " V " created in the mountains around Loch Lochy is visible . At Laggan Locks the last remaining ice-breaking tug to operate on the canal has been converted into a pub and cafe , making it a meeting point for boaters and locals . Good music and good malt whiskey can make the Scott II a very sociable evening venue . Loch Lochy , dominated by the peak of Ben Tee , is even more mysterious and silent than Loch Ness . The only stopping place is at the Letterfinlay Hotel where Bonnie Prince Charlie is reputed to have stayed . At the western end of the loch , Gairlochy Locks take the boats down two more steps , and then it is canal all the way to the sea at Banavie . Over on the port side the landscape is dominated by Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running close alongside the River Lochy to Banavie , where the charter boats turn around . A one-week charter is enough to make the 60-mile journey in each direction . The canal looks entirely different on the return trip . The vistas are constantly changing as the canal turns through the beautiful countryside , and in the open water of the lochs the rapidly changing light and colors of the Highland scenery create constant interest . There are shops , hotels or pubs at most stopping places , but you do need to plan your food a bit carefully to avoid running out of essentials . The charter boats are single-screw but easy to drive and maneuver , except in some of the strong wind conditions in the open lochs . The wind blows NE or SW , up or down the Great Glen , and it can whip up nasty seas in the open water . However , even if you have to wait , you will never tire of the wonderful scenery . A le If you do n't fancy driving your own boat and sorting out your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all for you . The Spirit is a converted Dutch barge , 100 feet long , that sleeps up to eight guests in double cabins . Large enough to ensure comfort , and with all food and drink included , it can take you on a one-way , three-day trip or a six-day , twoway trip along the canal with a variety of side excursions thrown in . The itinerary is very flexible . Special golfing holidays can also be arranged , where you play a different course each day and return to the Spirit at night . Whichever way you choose to travel the Caledonian Canal , it is a memorable experience . You can not finish such a vacation without a feeling of regret . It has a charm found in very few other places . As the Scots say when you leave their country , " Haste ye back !
