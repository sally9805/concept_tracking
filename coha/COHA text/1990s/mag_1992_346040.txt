A CENTURY AGO , WHEN AMERICANS HAD MORE AUSTERE sexual habits , they elected a President who was widely known to have had an illegitimate child . As a candidate , Grover Cleveland was mocked with the chant " Ma , Ma , where 's my pa ? Gone to the White House . Ha , ha , ha . " Yet Cleveland won the White House , occasioning his supporters ' memorable retort : <P> Hurrah for Maria <P> Hurrah for the kid <P> We voted for Grover <P> And we 're damn glad we did . <P> A hundred years later , Americans are more sexually permissive , but not , it seems , when it comes to their presidential candidates . The father of an illegitimate child could not possibly win the White House . In fact , Bill Clinton came perilously near to being politically destroyed by an allegation of adultery . Clinton escaped principally because Gennifer Flowers made a bad witness . It was possible to believe she was lying . Gary Hart , on the other hand , caught in sexual dalliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive . <P> Why ? Why should we care ? This is a country in which a sixth of all married adults admit to having had affairs , in which seduction trails only murder as the most popular form of TV entertainment , in which condoms are handed out in the high schools . Yet , as voters , we profess shock that our candidates should behave as we do . <P> As campaign coverage becomes saturated with questions of personal morality ( a.k.a. " character " ) , candidates respond with by now ritualized pledges of undying fealty to family and , above all , to " family values . " What is curious about these paeans to family , however , is that they come at a time when Americans seem intent as never before on taking the family apart . The divorce rate is more than twice what it was 30 years ago . More than half of , American children will live in a single-parent home sometime before age 18 . A quarter of all births in the U.S. occur out of wedlock , five times the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking : voters are demanding in their leaders the personal virtues that they decreasingly demand of themselves . The trend is not confined to matters of sex and family . There 's money too . The public has worked itself into a righteous frenzy over Congressmen overdrawing checks at the ( private  --  no taxpayer money involved ) House bank . This , while the American public , without any discernible protest , annually overdraws its national account by $400 billion a year , which amounts to the average family of four borrowing over $6,000 from its children to pay for its current indulgences . There is a word for the profession of virtue accompanied by practice of vice : hypocrisy . The usual complaint in democracies is that the politicians are hypocrites . The charge is old , common and true . But the equally valid charge , less often made so as not to offend , is that the people are hypocrites too . <P> And thank God for it . <P> Let me explain . In the best of all possible worlds , we would all both profess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we will have our vices . And it must be said that the modern vices of overindulgence ( dissipation and profligacy ) compare favorably with those of a century ago , which carried more than a tinge of cruelty . We no longer , for example , countenance cockfighting , child labor or the hanging of petty thieves .
