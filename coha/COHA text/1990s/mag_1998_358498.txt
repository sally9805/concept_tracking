In the gossipy literary circles of New York City , the half-life of an industry secret is generally the next lunch . That 's why the announcement last week that German media titan Bertelsmann AG was buying Random House was doubly shocking . Hardly anyone knew that the venerable American publishing institution , a supposedly sacrosanct division of Advance Publications , was for sale . The estimated $1.4 billion deal was negotiated surreptitiously over four months . Indeed , many Random House staff members found out about it by reading the morning newspaper . <P> The sale makes Bertelsmann , based in Gutersloh , Germany , the leader in American publishing . It 's just more evidence that in a world of global-media companies , assets do n't care what address they call home . Bertelsmann , known for its hands-off reputation with its other U.S. publishing division , Bantam Doubleday Dell ( BDD ) , will maintain the Random House name and keep the editorial operation independent . But the new two-volume division will get much greater leverage with agents , authors and booksellers . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed out last week . The combined company will hold 23% of what the industry calls trade books , the nearly $7 billion of nontechnical titles bought by general readers . The company , with $1.8 billion in revenue , will be double the size of the next largest house , Simon &; Schuster . " We 're all as surprised as the rest of the world , " says Jack Romanos , a top Simon &; Schuster executive . " To be perfectly honest , I 'm not sure we understand what it means yet . " <P> In selling a family jewel , Samuel I. ( " Si " ) Newhouse Jr. , chairman of Random House 's parent company , Advance Publications , proved that he could read a market as well as a book . And publishing is not a pretty story . Costs have been skyrocketing in a market shaken by high advances , torpid sales and power struggles with superstore book chains . In a statement , Newhouse said the company had reached a " decision to focus its efforts on the management and expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journals and cable . " <P> On the other side of the Atlantic , Bertelsmann had been quite vocal about its intention to acquire another U.S. company . The Germans perused the profit and loss statements of Simon &; Schuster , owned by Viacom , and of HarperCollins , controlled by News Corp. , but could n't make a deal . For Bertelsmann , the world 's third largest media company , the merger immediately establishes a long-sought commanding presence in the U.S. , the world 's largest media market . " Random House is a dream for Bertelsmann , " says Thomas Middelhoff , 44 , who engineered the deal just six months before officially stepping into the CEO 's job . " I was as surprised as everyone else , " says Sonny Mehta , president of Knopf , a prestigious Random House division . " I thought about it and said it 's a very logical partner to have .
