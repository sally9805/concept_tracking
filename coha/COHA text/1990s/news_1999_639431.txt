<p> DALLAS - Wireless technology could make the to-do list obsolete as shoppers interested in purchasing a book , compact disc , software program or anything else get in the habit of simply acting on their impulses , no matter where they are . <p> Already , it 's possible to place an order for any of those products using a digital cellular phone or hand-held organizer . <p> In the next few years , people who find their time increasingly precious will regularly order products while they sit around airport terminals or doctors ' waiting rooms , says Jeff Bezos , chairman and chief executive of Amazon.com Inc. , the Seattle-based online retailer . <p> Electronic commerce is changing the way the world shops , Bezos said . Within 10 years , about 15 percent of retail sales will be conducted online , up from less than 1 percent today , he said . <p> Traffic to Amazon.com 's site has been heavy this holiday season . But the company , which has been expanding warehouse operations in the past year , has been able to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with customer service , he said . <p> ' We 've done a very good job of satisfying customer promises this year , probably the best we 've ever done at holiday time , ' he said . <p> Here are additional questions asked Bezos : <p> Q. What 's your sense of how the season went for online retailing in general ? <p> A. You do extensive market research . It does n't take much to find people buy more this time of year . They buy gifts . It 's a shocker . We got prepared with 7 million square feet of gift wrap and 12 million feet of ribbon and 3 million square feet of distribution-center space - which is a lot , by the way . It 's hard to imagine , but that 's seven major distribution centers spread around the country . One of the unfortunate things is that , without naming any names , some of the e-commerce retailers put all of their effort into the more glamorous side of the business , which is the Web site . And they forget about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may not be as glamorous , but believe me , customers want it . Some companies that were new to this , maybe it was their first Christmas online , were a little overwhelmed . At this stage in the development of e-commerce , it 's clearly true not all e-commerce companies are created equal with regard to customer experience . The best way to choose where to buy online today is to talk to your friends and find out where they 've had good experiences and bad experiences . <p> Q. Are you concerned about the whole industry getting a black eye ? <p> A. I worried about that last year . This year , I 'm much less worried about it . We have more than 13 million people who have successfully shopped at Amazon.com . That 's a large enough critical mass . <p> ' Customers are smart enough to know that a bad experience at one place , they do n't have to write off the whole category . <p> Q. Amazon has expanded from its original mission selling books into music , video , toys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any product you 're certain Amazon will not be interested in selling ? <p> A. We have some policy areas . Two category areas are firearms and live animals . But we actually do have an investment in a company called Pets.com that sells live goldfish . So maybe the live-animals policy will go away over time . <p> Q. Last year , Congress imposed a three-year moratorium on new taxes covering Internet transactions . Would you favor extending it ? <p> A. I would . I think you should n't mess with something that 's driving the economy right now . <p> Q. As Internet-related transactions become a bigger part of the economy , calls for a variety of forms of regulation are likely to increase . People are particularly concerned about privacy issues unique to cyberspace . Do you think some forms of regulation are coming ? <p> A. I would expect so . In some cases , it might be for better . In some cases , it might be for worse . Either way , over time you should expect it . <p> ' I would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations while this thing is still small . Wait a little while and make sure you get it right . Privacy is going to be and should be an incredibly important issue . It 's not just the Internet . Modern technology is making a lot of things easy that used to be difficult . It 's really more about databases than the Internet . Some records have always been public . <p> ' You can go to the courthouse and see deed records and all sorts of things . But when you put it all on a database and make it easily searchable , it changes the whole feel . <p> ' Before , if you wanted to get that information , it was expensive and time-consuming . You 'd only do it if it was important , not just a matter of satisfying curiosity . There are a whole bunch of areas that will have to be looked at and reconsidered . <p> Q. Much of the selling on Amazon.com is based on the effective use of database technology , selling people something they do n't even know they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a critical advantage and also how you balance this knowledge with the privacy issue : <p> A. What we 're doing is personalizing the store for every customer . We 've already been doing a significant amount of this . We have something called instant recommendations . <p> ' If you 're a repeat customer , the store greets you by name and says click here for personalized book recommendations , toy recommendations and there are different links . <p> ' The way the technology works is called collaborative filtering . It looks at your past purchases and compares them with other customers in aggregate . It can make a reasonably insightful guess as to what other things you might be interested in . <p> ' This is one of the most loved features of our customers . They 're always surprised at how good it is in helping them find things . <p> ' Now , if a company like Amazon.com wants to be able to provide that kind of benefit for customers , then we have to earn trust with customers with respect to keeping that information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in physical-world infrastructure for warehouses , which surprised a lot of people , but what about stores ? <p> A. The problem with us doing that is nobody has discovered any kind of synergy between online and offline yet . <p> ' People talk about customers returning things to the physical stores . Maybe that 's a synergy . The problem is , ' Have you ever had a pleasant returns experience in a physical store ? " It 's not something people are seeking out to do . The second thing is , we as a company have no competency doing physical-world stores . These businesses are not similar . <p> ' A physical-world store selling toys is much more similar to a physical-world store selling tools or books than it is to an online store selling toys . <p> ' If we tried to do physical-world stores , we might mess it up . We do n't know how to do that . We know how to do e-commerce . <p> Q. Do you see a shakeout coming among e-commerce companies ? <p> A. The period we 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago - when single-cell life first exploded into multi-cell life . Every conceivable combination of life was created and the fossil record shows that . <p> ' It was the greatest speciation ever seen , but it was also the greatest rate of extinction ever seen . All these experiments are being done with companies online . There will be thousands of winners . <p> ' There will also be thousands of failures . That 's natural . I think it 's been happening over the last couple of years and it will continue to happen . ' @p#
