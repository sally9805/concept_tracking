LINK ( Still in his arms . ) Hello , William . WILLIAM ( Trying to recover . ) All right , all right , this is really an intrusion . This is really second-rate is what it is . I can not believe have I ever gone through your purses , have I ever gone through JENNY You were going to say " our drawers " ? WILLIAM No , no , I was n't , Jenny , I was n't going to say " your drawers . " I was pointing out that there are issues of privacy , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Link . ) Oh . Excuse me .

I do n't give the same thing , I do n't get the same thing . The me that is with each of you could not respond to the others . That self is faithful and would never betray you . You would n't want that part of me you do n't have , and were I not as complex as I am there would n't have been enough of each part of me for you to relate to , to care about , in fact , to love . ( There is a long , stunned pause . ) JONES What the hell is he talking about ? LINK He has many souls . JENNY He da three-souled man . WILLIAM Go ahead , Jenny , make fun of what you do n't understand .

You want to be carried into deeper water . JENNY Well I will admit that it 's getting pretty deep . WILLIAM Now I 'm not saying there are n't issues here . Matters of the heart , intimacies that I want to discuss with you alone , Jenny , and you too Jones , of course I meant you , too . JONES Okay now , I want to get down and talk some Georgia talk here you know , get right on down in the red dirt here and what I got on my mind is " am I is or am I ai n't your tuna melt ? " p. 10 WILLIAM I am what you need me to be , Jones . ( Link locks the door . ) What are you doing , Link ? LINK I am making here old-fashioned totalitarian state . JENNY ( Moving one chair away from the others . ) Sit down , William . WILLIAM I see no reason to sit down . JENNY Bill , do you remember when we very recently began seriously to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JENNY Do you remember saying you wanted a really big wedding ? WILLIAM Yes I do . JENNY And I said , " Honey , I just do n't know that many people , " and you said , " Sweetie , I could list two hundred family , friends , and business associates right now . " And I bet you ten dollars and , by golly , you sat right down and did it ! LINK He has good organizational memory , to do this he had to have such a memory . JENNY ( Taking a paper out of her briefcase . ) Now , Bill , this is the account of your activities today that I plan to fax to that list if you do n't sit down . ( He glances over the letter and sits down . ) I know it 's a little heavy on sexual specifics , but you have such a remarkably individual style I thought it made good reading . p. 11 JONES I am never dressing up like that again at 6 AM ! WILLIAM What precisely is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JONES Ah . JENNY What precisely ? Well , we want you to meet someone . LINK ( Russian ) Vlah-de-meer , vuh-(k)huh-de ! Puh-rh rahbaow-thts . ( Vladimir , come in ! It is time to go to work . ) ( Vladimir enters . ) Vladimir , I am wanting you to meet interesting person William . William , this is interesting person Vladimir . ( Vladimir clicks his heels and bows slightly . ) WILLIAM If you are planning to kill me or harm me , I would like it to be clearly understood that I am a lawyer , my friends are lawyers , my mother is a lawyer , my brother Don is a ferocious lawyer , and you will pay . P-A-Y . Pay . LINK I like this , William , this is very dramatic , but in this time we do n't kill you . This is very funny idea though . You make good Russian joke . Wait , one moment , I tell Vladimir . ( In Russian , Link communicates William 's fear . Vladimir laughs and slaps William on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " the lady and the tiger . " Behind two doors , the choice is yours . Here 's the deal . I will fax the aforementioned document to the aforementioned list , or Vladimir will tattoo on your butt our version of what you did today . ( Jenny hands William another piece of paper . ) WILLIAM What ? ! JONES Signed . JENNY And dated . WILLIAM You are kidding . JENNY Take a good look at Vladimir . Does he look like he 's kidding ? ( Vladimir opens his bag , takes out a small towel , and begins laying out the tools of his trade . ) LINK In Russia , this man is thoracic surgeon , but in America he is tattoo artist . Such is fate of Russian people . ( Russian . ) Niee plhts , moy droohg . ( Do not weep , my friend . ) ( He wipes his eyes . ) WILLIAM ( Still holding the paper . ) I am supposed to go through life with this tattooed on my butt ? JENNY William , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 JONES But they can take a tattoo off . LINK Not with Russian inks . WILLIAM I can not believe this is happening to me ! JENNY So you choose the fax ? WILLIAM You know perfectly well that would ruin my career . JENNY Well , see now , we just seem to be on the horns of a dilemma . JONES Your career or your rear . LINK The lady JONES Or your skinny white butt . WILLIAM How the hell did the three of you find out about each other ? LINK Vladimir is also private detective . WILLIAM ( To Link . ) And what made you think you needed a private detective ? LINK Because , my darling , I am Russian . JENNY So what 'll it be , Billy ? WILLIAM Can I have just a goddamn minute here ? JONES I 'm gon na wash your mouth out with soap . LINK Man must come to terms with tragic fate . Is good . Okay , while you think , Vladimir will sing you song of suffering and transfiguration from Ukraine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling . ) And I will read you Kama Sutra. p. 14 WILLIAM Oh God . LINK You say tonight our souls , our bodies will become one through Kama Sutra . This I do n't want to miss . ( Link begins reading the first few sentences of the Kama Sutra , " Man , the period of whose life is one hundred years , should practise Dharma , Artha , and Kama at different times and in such a manner that they may harmonize together and not clash in any way . He should acquire learning in his childhood , in his youth , and middle age he should attend to Artha and Kama , and in his old age he should perform Dharma , and thus seek to gain Moksha , i.e. , release from further transmigration . " Vladimir sings more softly and prepares , the women watch . William fumes and puts his head in his hands . Lights out. )
