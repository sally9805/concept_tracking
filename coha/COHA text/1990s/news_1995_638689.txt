<p> When you have one of the greatest trade names in the world , you do everything you can to exploit the brand franchise . <p> Denver-based Samsonite Corp . is the world 's largest manufacturer of luggage , but company Chairman Steven Green said last week that Samsonite has only barely begun to penetrate key markets around the world , including India and China . <p> Green , who steered Samsonite 's former parent in and out of bankruptcy in 1992 and 1993 , said the $ 635 million-a-year luggage company must grow in two directions . <p> " Number one , we have to take our core luggage business and move into new markets . For instance , there are 125 million people in India who can buy a Samsonite product , " said Green , a 50-year-old corporate bailout expert who shares a place on the Samsonite board with such financial luminaries as Carl Icahn and Leon Black , a principal in Apollo Advisors and formerly of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . <p> Samsonite 's second task is to introduce new products into new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods such as computer and camera cases , car-top carriers , motorcycle saddlebags and numerous other hard- and soft-sided products that can be manufactured by adapting the company 's luggage-making expertise . <p> The Post interviewed Green and other company executives before the firm 's annual meeting last week . <p> To illustrate Green 's points , Samsonite International President Luc Van Nevel said the company recently formed a venture in Europe to make and market shoes under the Samsonite name in Italy and Germany . Van Nevel is based in Belgium and is responsible for company production and sales outside the Western Hemisphere . <p> Leather goods , including belts and wallets , are being marketed with the Samsonite name in both Europe and the United States . " The corners on this wallet will never wear out , " said Thomas Leonard , Samsonite 's president for the Western Hemisphere , pulling a sturdy-looking Samsonite billfold out of his pocket . <p> Yet Samsonite 's move into diversified products poses special problems , Green acknowledged . Foremost among them are the unfamiliar channels of distribution for these goods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores and wallets and other leather products through leather-goods retailers . Samsonite has no experience with these routes of distribution , he said . <p> Instead , Samsonite 's distribution channel consists of luggage stores and the luggage departments of mass merchandisers and department stores . <p> For that reason , as important as new products are to Samsonite 's future , the company 's focus is likely to remain on luggage . <p> Samsonite 's dominance of the worldwide luggage market is staggering . The company 's product line includes luggage that carries the Samsonite , Lark and American Tourister names . <p> Green said Samsonite spends more on advertising and promotion than many of its competitors report as annual sales . <p> Still , the Samsonite executives say that while the company dominates the luggage industry internationally , it is not as profitable as it must be to compete in the global market . <p> The company 's profitability was depressed in the past year by imported bags that " flooded " the U.S. market as cheap , poorly constructed " clones " of Samsonite 's upright , wheeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vertical , " piggyback " luggage products in the late 1980s . Competitors have been developing immitations ever since , say Samsonite executives . <p> " We dropped prices ( to challenge the imports ) , and we have been developing products that will compete with them , " said Green . " That has had a material impact on the business . " <p> Expanding into new markets internationally " also costs money , " he added . <p> Last month , the company said 1995 second-quarter and six-month operating results continue to reflect a weak retail market , " increased low-cost foreign competition within the United States and higher raw material costs worldwide . " <p> Samsonite reported earnings before interest expense , taxes , amortization and depreciation for the second-quarter ended July 31 of $ 17.9 million , down 23.5 percent from comparable earnings in the year-earlier quarter . Sales for the recent quarter totaled $ 167.7 million , a gain of 5.3 percent over the sales volume in the same quarter of 1994 . <p> Company Chief Financial Officer Thomas Sandler said Samsonite wo n't start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of charging to earnings about $ 55 million a year in amortization of goodwill-type expenses . <p> That process , part of the bankruptcy reorganization of Astrum International Corp. , Samsonite 's former parent , should be completed by next summer , he said . <p> Green joined Astrum 's predecessor , E-II Holdings , about seven years ago . E-II was one of the infamous corporate stews of the 1980s . <p> " I sold a biscuit company , a pizza company , a louvered-blind company and a beef jerky company , " Green said , referring to the unloading of E-II , and later Astrum , assets . E-II filed for bankruptcy in 1992 and emerged the next year from Chapter 11 as Astrum . <p> Earlier this year , Astrum was dissolved and the company 's key remaining assets , Samsonite and Culligan Water Technologies Inc. , were split into separate publicly traded companies . <p> Commenting on the market in Samsonite 's debt securities , fixed-income analyst Herbert Lust III of Furman Selz Inc. said in a recent research report that unless the luggage maker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the company 's senior subordinated notes . <p> " While the current rate of earnings deterioration is saddening , no immediate default seems likely , " Lust added . " Therefore , the question is one of determining the market 's appetite for risk , and commensurate yield required . " <p> Icahn , Black and others who invested in E-II 's debt securities years ago understand the risk-reward equation that surrounds Samsonite . They invested in E-II 's bonds and subordinated debt when they were worth 22 cents and 9 cents on the dollar , Green said . <p> In the intervening years , as the company reorganized and the prices of the securities improved , they made tens of millions of dollars on their investments in the company . <p> Today , four investors - Black , Icahn , Green and Leon Cooperman of New York 's Omega Advisors - own about 85 percent of Samsonite 's common stock . <p> Despite the challenge that less expensive foreign-made goods have posed for Samsonite , Green remains a committed free trader . He is on President Clinton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encourages the expansion of U.S. exports . <p> If Clinton has " an opportunity to take a bow , it is because of what this administration has done on international trade , " said Green , who last week returned along with dozens of other leading U.S. executives from an international sojourn sponsored by Time magazine . <p> Green especially praised Clinton 's support of the NAFTA and GATT trade pacts . " I support the president 's re-election and to the extent he asks me to be active ( in the campaign ) , I will be active . " <p> Samsonite employs about 1,200 people at its Denver headquarters and factory complex . About 800 work in the production of hard-sided luggage and luggage fixtures . <p> Between a quarter and a third of the Denver plant 's output of luggage is exported . The company has spent more than $ 35 million upgrading machinery and equipment at the plant over the past 10 years . <p> Two-thirds of Samsonite 's total of 6,500 employees work outside the United States . The company has plants and warehouses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain and Italy . <p> Commenting on how the financial markets assess Samsonite 's future , Furman Selz 's Lust points to the luggage maker 's claim that it was factors beyond managerial control - " low-cost foreign competition " and " higher raw material costs " - that hurt the company 's financial results . <p> " The question remains : What can change these outside determinants ? " Lust said in his report . <p> " Between NAFTA and GATT , world trade has opened up and changed the competitive dynamic in the luggage industry . Investors have heard about how wonderful the Samsonite franchise is , how wonderful the product innovation is , how wonderful the macroeconomic prospects are . Now , they would just like to see some wonderful numbers .
