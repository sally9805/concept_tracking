<p> On the eve of the Hebrew holy time called Succoth , as thousands of Jews prayed at the sacred site known as the Western Wall , a double desecration took place . <p> A crowd of 3,000 Arabs , many carrying stones brought with intent to throw , took up position overlooking the worshipers at the wall . Amid shrieks of hatred inciting the mob to violence , the bombardment of stones began . The congregation fled in terror ; 28 of those in prayer were reportedly wounded . <p> That was the desecration of Judaism , designed to provoke police on the scene to bloody reaction . <p> The desecration of Islam was in the abuse of that religion by political calculators : to whip up fear in the faithful to trigger the attack , to provoke a panicked response from surprised and endangered police , and to sacrifice a score of Palestinian Arab lives in the cause of Saddam Hussein 's secular goal of regional domination . <p> Before joining the rush to the condemnation of Israel sought by the operation 's planners , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody episode , and who lost ? <p> Certainly the greatest losers are the score of Palestinian dead . The State of Israel also loses ; it had learned to contain the intifada with minimum force , but did not think it necessary to mass experienced anti-riot troops at this holiest of sites , never before the target of terrorists on this scale . <p> The winners ? Yasir Arafat 's P.L.O. , which had been languishing outside the media pale after aligning itself with the invaders of Kuwait . Suddenly he 's in the news again , not as an accessory to aggression but as the avenger of victims . <p> The big winner is Saddam Hussein , who has been seeking to change the subject from his money-grubbing conquest of Kuwait to a more messianic jihad . This most unholy man , scourge of the ayatollahs , has had difficulty fashioning himself as the leader of a holy war ; now he seeks linkage of his personal bid for world power to the Palestinian cause . <p> With the same poignant sense of public relations that had him patting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hussein promptly christened his newest missile " the Stone , " after the rocks hurled at the Jewish worshipers at the Western Wall . Tipped with poison gas or germs , the Saddam Stone will be aimed at Israel . <p> In that light of who won and who lost , and in the absolute predictability of Arab demonstrations and U.N . condemnation , logic suggests inexorably that this successful provocation was no accident . <p> P.L.O . apologists claim their rock-carrying crowd assembled to counter an Israeli religious group that wanted to build a new temple . Never mind that the Israeli courts had banned such a demonstrationby Jews , or that the police assured the Arabs that no march would take place . <p> The Iraqi-P.L.O. manipulators used that rumor nonetheless to whip up the crowd and give religious cover to their political incitement . They chose a religious target , undermanned by 40 guards - and those police unable to cope with the riot by using tear gas and the nonlethal weapons of intifada specialists . The P.L.O . got what it sought : enough of its hapless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> We wondered what the Iraqi dictator and his P.L.O . supporter were cooking up in Baghdad ; most suspected a terrorist attack on the Dhahran landing docks in Saudi Arabia . But that would have triggered this war 's Sarajevo ; by having Palestinian Arabs attack worshipers , draw fire and die in Jerusalem , Mr. Hussein distracted the West and discombobulated his Arab opponents . <p> He has now shown how he can use our hesitation to shift attention away from Kuwait and toward Israel . Mr. Bush , following the advice of James Baker and John Kelly ( longtime Saddam Hussein manipulatees ) , criticized the overreaction of Israeli police and merely regretted the worshiper-stoning provocation ; our allies will remove the " regret . " <p> The U.N . chastisement registers this Arab concern : that opposition to an expansionist dictator is not to be construed as approval of a democracy where worshipers are too-aggressively protected from organized stoning . Such hypocrisy belongs with the U.N . vote to condemn Israel in 1981 for taking out the Iraqi reactor . <p> This is another skirmish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hussein will probably attack Israel , as augured in this provocation , seeking estoppel of Arab participation in his defeat . <p> But his strategic diversion wo n't work . His complicity in the Succoth double desecration will be one more charge in next year 's war crimes trial .
