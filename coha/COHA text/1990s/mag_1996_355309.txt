For Willie Kennedy , a 72-year-old grandmother and former member of San Francisco 's Board of Supervisors , it was a clear-cut issue of racism : last March a Domino 's Pizza and a Mr. Pizza Man refused to deliver to her grandson William Fobbs at his home in a predominantly black area near Candlestick Park . The Domino 's franchise , like most Domino 's Pizzas across the country , used a software system that color-codes streets according to risk ; a large swath of Fobbs ' neighborhood had been " red-zoned , " meaning it was deemed too dangerous to serve . <P> Livid , Kennedy got the Board of Supervisors to pass the country 's first ordinance making it illegal for any firm to deny delivery to an address in its business service area . " These people feel that all black people are the same , " says Kennedy of the taxicabs , restaurants and furniture stores that redline service . " We all kill , we all maim , and therefore we should suffer . But there is crime all over this city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered in San Francisco in 1994 , it happened in a designated safe , or " green , " zone . <P> Last week , only days after the ordinance went into effect , the board voted to amend it and allow businesses to exercise " reasonable " judgment in delivering to certain spots . Kennedy called this a " stab in the back , " but board president Kevin Shelley insists the revision is needed to address legitimate issues of worker safety . Domino 's spokesman Tim McIntyre points out that Domino 's delivers to more inner-city areas than most chains  --  and says the computer system helps them do it safely .
