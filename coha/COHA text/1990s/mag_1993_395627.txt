Everything I have learned about love , I learned from my mother . For it is mothers who bend , twist , flex and break most dramatically before our uninitiated eyes . Fathers bear , conceal , inflict and sometimes vanish , or so the mythology of domestic union tells us . But mothers absorb , accept , give in  --  all to tutor daughters in the syntax and the grammar of yearning and love . My mother , Beatrice Lee Reid , fled poverty and Greensboro , North Carolina , in the late 1920 's , leaving an ex-husband behind . I learned of this prior husband offhandedly , in passing , a secret hoarded until I was nearly 20 . My mother arrived in Washington , D.C. , radiant and ambitious , and subsequently married two more men . The first of the two , Mr. Robinson , was benevolent and possessed a heart he swore was designed only to love my mother . But Mr. Harold Robinson , haunted by childhood demons and doubts , was an alcoholic who too often sank to the status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish , he drove away the woman whom in his irregular moments of lucidity and confidence he almost perfectly loved . Francis Sherman Golden was my mother 's third husband . He was steel-willed and eager to control the small fortune my mother had gained through gambling and hard work . Even more than he wanted to love Beatrice Lee Reid , Francis Sherman Golden longed to conquer and absorb her will . To my mother he must have seemed as large as Mr. Robinson appeared small . Francis Sherman Golden was my father . It is only now , inside the fluid boundaries of a good , loving marriage , that I can face and recompose the lessons my mother taught me about love . Her legacy to me is stark and contradictory . I watched the drama of my parents ' turbulent , tortured union and learned that it is n't love unless it hurts . My parents ' marriage was a symphony of passion and extremes . Both my parents were gamblers . They played the numbers and won often . I remember trips to Raleigh 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big winning my father would stand before a three-way mirror , peacock-proud , and be measured by a white salesman for a half dozen tailor-made suits . I remember the black Lincoln Continental he bought once and how it sat sleek and somehow fitting before our three-story rooming house , until it was repossessed three months later . And my parents gambled with their emotions too , perfecting arctic silences , filling the house with blasts of recrimination and accusation that echoed long into the night , crawling beneath my bedroom door and living inside my dreams . My father regularly stalked out of the house bags in hand , only to return a week later , my mother 's arms greeting him with trembling and faith . In the last , most awful years of this marriage I sometimes accompanied my mother on furtive yet somehow sacred visits to Mr. Robinson . In his cramped , tiny basement apartment they sat and talked openly , affection warming each word , the way I rarely saw my mother talk with my father . In the midst of what I now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation turn into a sensual , life-giving force . I watched my mother talk to her ex-husband and learned that love is sometimes remarkably straightforward and that love is feeling safe . Parents render lessons about love in subversive , ironic ways . My father often took me with him when he visited the women my mother accused him of having as lovers . These women doted on me , bribed me with candy and other treats and installed me in the kitchen or in the living room in front of their 19-inch black-and-white TVs while they catered to my father , my presence giving them one more reason to love him . These women taught me nothing , for I was too ashamed of my father to look at them . But when I went with my mother to visit Mr. Robinson , silver-haired and so light-skinned that he had sometimes passed for White before marrying my caramel-colored mother , I saw a man ravaged by alcohol and other demons , who nonetheless provoked in my mother a loyalty and compassion my father seemed not to need . Francis Sherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have felt in the wake of her break with Mr. Robinson . Once she hinted at the sexual reawakening my father inspired when they met in the first months after she left Mr. Robinson . My mother was a marvelously feminine , sexually confident woman who met more than her match in my father . They were combustible and electric together . This is what my mother meant when she said once that when she got up in the mornings , my father made her feel like she could tear up the house and put it together again . But during the years of their marriage , they never shaped a language to escort them from the horizontal to the vertical , from passion to navigating gracefully through the mundane . The deaths of my parents , a year and a half apart , as I was completing college , have given them back to me , in the years that have passed , truer , more clearly than they existed in life . I loved them when they lived . In the aftermath of their deaths I have tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limiting designations of mother and father . My own faltering , reckless , sometimes wise attempts at loving men have imbued me with an empathy for how hard it was for them to do what they did  --  raise me with love , even when the love they felt for each other was so fragile and so frequently mocked their best intentions . Because now I possess my own personal history of love failed and remade , marriage tried and reshaped , I recall my parents through the telescope of a memory whose lens is finally clear , magnifying , minimizing , but honing a sharper image of who they really were . I know now that my mother must have been irresistible to my father . When he met her she was just past 40 , a Black woman as restless and hungry for life as he . She had propelled herself from domestic worker to property owner , and her personal charisma rivaled his own , hovering around her like some expensive yet subtle perfume . I am the age now my mother was when she met my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unquenchable was her thirst for fulfillment . She had proved herself to herself . But she wanted more . DANCES OF RAGE I like to think that there must have been periods of contentment and satisfaction for my mother with my father . I just do n't recall those times as vividly as I remember the pain . I rarely saw my parents kiss , but I saw them fight more than I care to remember . The fights were the sorrowful , exhausted last-ditch efforts of two intelligent people for whom words simply did not work . These were not the kind of physical battles that blackened eyes or sparked blood from broken , peeling skin or produced maimed limbs . Rather they were a carefully choreographed dance of rage , as articulate in their own way as a blast of oratory . In the most vivid , awful memory , I am 8 years old and waking from a nap on the sofa one evening . I have been awakened by muffled yet clearly audible groans and a thudding , thumping sound . I woke , I remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was knowledge of what I would see once I opened my eyes . My father was pushing my mother , a sturdy buxom woman , dressed , I remember even now , in a fashionable print dress , against the flowered wallpapered living-room walls again and again . There were no fists , no slaps , just a continual pushing , he of her , against the wall as if to pin her there and capture or extinguish the source of her resistance , and her continued pushing against him . I sat on the sofa immobilized , shamed , afraid , hating , loving them both , willing myself to disappear , willing my body to move , but not moving because I 'd never been able to stop them before . Finally I transported myself out of the room away from them in my imagination , but was still racked by guilt because I did not try to stop them . What I remember most is that my mother , in those trysts of violence , always gave as good as she got . I remember too that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of his physical power . But mostly I remember that my mother refused to back down . TIME TO EXIT Like my mother , in my adult life I mastered the grand exit , the final cataclysmic leave-taking that was a combination kiss-my-behind and romantic heroine 's spine-straight stride into the future just beyond the horizon . When my mother left my father , she did it as easily , as sublimely as going for a Sunday drive . After the years of arguments , the fights , the test of wills , she was too exhausted , I imagine , to leave with anything other than grace and forbearance . I entered the house after school that afternoon , and she told me simply : " We 're leaving your father . " This was a statement I had spent much of my childhood dreading , waiting to hear , watching it take shape in the bickering , the sniping and the increasing absence of affection . That day my mother taught me that you can leave : It is never too late to do that . The rooming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would live her remaining years sorely regretting what she had lost . So maybe sometimes it is too late to leave , too late for the leaving to matter . But my mother would say leave anyway . So when I had to , I could leave a man when it was over because I had witnessed my mother saying good-bye to my father when nothing was left . But in the years that followed , when my father became a visitor in our tiny city-subsidized apartment and my parents became , miraculously , friends , my mother stoked and encouraged my loyalty to and love of my father , despite their past or perhaps because of it . She never allowed me to do anything less than honor my father . My mother exiled herself from three men whose names and legacies she had carried . With Mr. Robinson and my father , I watched her shape , in the aftermath of her flight , some facsimile of emotional equity , find the flickers of grace and charity that had sometimes activated even the most impenetrable moments of shared doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother to shape with these men so steadfastly after marriage what had been resistant and foreign when she was bound to them by love and law . Was marriage too confining a concept for Beatrice Lee Reid ? Did she require in the end autonomy and the love of a man ? Neither my father nor Mr. Robinson possessed the emotional integration , the proper mix of strength and vulnerability that my mother required . But the evidence , as I sift through the remnants of my mother 's life , like searching for a ghost , reveals that my mother was a woman of extremes , whose love thrived somehow on the off-center , the slightly distorted . My surrogate aunt , one of my mother 's oldest friends , who witnessed my mother 's life up close , who saw her fall for Mr. Robinson and come under the spell of my father , told me that one evening when she sat with my mother bemoaning the aftermath of a disappointing love affair , she swore , " No more men . Never again . " My mother looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , there is always going to be somebody 's feet up under my table . " This was a declaration of independence and a recognition of the necessity of mating , sex and love . That " somebody " would be sitting at my mother 's table , not theirs , yet they would be there because she wanted and needed them to be . " Your mother was her own woman in the end , " my aunt concluded , " but Mr. Robinson was n't strong enough to hold her . Your father 's strength came up against hers , and she would n't give in . " When I left my first husband and suffered several years of bitter , guilty estrangement because I am my mother 's daughter , there came a time when I had to give my son back his father , as my mother had given me mine back . Though my son and his father are separated by a continent , I fan the flames of their father-son love , retrieved , in time , I found . It is never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother taught me to leave , to stay and to forgive . I fell in love with and married the man who is my husband now because he is not afraid to feel or express affection . I love him because he can tell me what he needs and wants . My husband is as addicted to language , its possibilities , its power , as I am . And I fell in love with his ability to talk , was seduced by his skillful obliteration of the remembered silences of my parents ' marriage and of my first . My mother taught me how to find this man and what to do once I had him . For in her sojourns back to Mr. Robinson , she dramatized for me the excitement , the thrill of a man and woman sitting together , talking quietly , sometimes saying nothing verbally , allowing a gaze , a touch , to articulate what was too monumental and fragile to be said . Often my mother talked the most , and I saw Mr. Robinson listen , his dull , weathered demeanor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . My mother was teaching me that love is talking and it is listening too . Certainly I would have wished more happiness for my mother . But while I witnessed her marriage to my father , I was a spectator , biased and with vested interests . I was not resident inside the skin of their feelings . I could hear their voices but not always perfectly translate the text . And perhaps the respect they accorded each other in the end was a kind of love , the one they had been journeying toward all along . One February afternoon in 1971 my mother suffered a cerebral hemorrhage , from which she ultimately died six months later . She was 63 years old . The day before the stroke she had spent the afternoon with her special " man friend , " who lived several blocks from our apartment . When she entered the apartment that afternoon , some intangible aura of satisfaction blossoming around her , her movements energized and quick , I knew she had had sex . I could tell , for I was 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my senses humming the same splendid tune . But I was ambivalent , sometimes downright hostile to the idea of my gray-haired mother , arthritic , sometimes forgetful , having an affair with a man . But my mother had decided that she would live until she died . Throughout her life , every exit , every stand taken , every act of loyalty , every transgression forgotten , had stitched another panel in this belief . My mother lived and loved until she died . I am her daughter , and so will I. Marita Golden is the author of the memoir Migrations of the Heart and several novels , including most recently And Do Remember Me . <p>
