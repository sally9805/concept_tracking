Marc has seen men die trying to carry less weight in trade goods than his friend , Henri Bonga , will attempt to haul over nine miles of steep , rocky trail . <p> Here it is-the Grand Portage . " Marc turned from his friend , Henri Bonga , and studied the rocky trail . The nine mile portage was the most famous and brutal carry in all the North West Territory . This was the moment that Marc had been dreading since he left Montreal six weeks ago . In May 1800 , he 'd signed on as a voyageur with the North West Fur Company . His eight-canoe brigade had already paddled and portaged 50,000 pounds of trade goods across 1,200 miles of wilderness to reach the mid-summer rendezvous at Grand Portage . Rising each morning before 4 and laboring until dusk , the voyageurs were an elite corps who paddled 36-foot freight canoes up Canada 's Ottawa River and across Lake Huron and Lake Superior . Though the trip had toughened Marc , he feared that tomorrow 's carry would be more than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Henri asked , gesturing up the hill . " Though we call it the Grand Portage , the Ojibwa know it as Kitchi Onigaming . " Marc glanced back at the gray waters of Lake Superior and then turned to measure the rise with his eye . aI can see why the voyageurs who 've wintered in the North brag so much , " Marc said , hoping his voice did n't betray his fear . Though Marc was only 13 , he had managed every portage so far on their 1,200-mile paddle from Montreal . But the longest carry had been just over a mile . How could he portage his standard , two-pack load of 180 pounds up a " mountain " such as this ? he thought . To make matters worse , he knew that each voyageur was required to make four trips , delivering two parcels of trade goods to Fort Charlotte-the departure point for brigades headed north-and returning to the Grand Portage depot with two bundles of furs each time . " It 's a tough one , " Henri admitted . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's cheaper to cripple men . " He laughed and clapped Marc across his back . " And remember-you get a Spanish dollar for every extra parcel you carry . " Marc tried to laugh , but the best he could manage was a weak chuckle . The four trips up the hill and back would total more than 70 miles . Carrying anything " extra " was out of the question . His friend Henri had nothing to worry about . Legendary for his strength , Henri was a mixed-blood voyageur who was part French , part Ojibwa and part black . He never carried less than three packs-a 270-pound load-on any portage , yet he took even the steepest hills without effort . A quiet man , Henri prided himself on his bright red sash and his matching red cap . His cap was topped with a feather that made him look even taller than his 6 feet 6 inches . " You 've got lots of tough miles behind you , string bean , " Henri said , as they paused before the company storehouse . Henri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . It was late afternoon , and the day was unusually warm for Superior 's north shore . " Once you make the Grand Portage and paddle across the divide , you 'll leave the pork eaters behind and become a Hivernant-a winterer . " Marc nodded . He did n't mind Henri teasing him about being skinny . He did n't mind his canoe mates kidding him about his blond hair and blue eyes either , because nearly all the voyageurs were dark-skinned and brown-eyed . But he was tired of being called a pork eater . That was the name given to men who paddled the Montreal to Grand Portage supply route and never ventured farther north . The name came from the fact that they mainly ate dried corn boiled with pork fat , while the men on the northern routes feasted on pemmican and wild game . Marc and every FrenchCanadian boy dreamed of becoming hommes du nord or true men of the North , but his first step was to master the Grand Portage . Could he make it ? Marc and Henri paused before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was a flurry of activity inside . Crude jokes and shouted oaths accompanied the work of the clerks who were sorting goods for the upcoming trading season . " Of all the bumbling fools- " a self-important little clerk shouted , as he pulled a broken mirror from a pack . " Do you idiots kick your parcels across the portages ? " " We did you a favor by breaking that , sir , " Henri said , staring the clerk straight in the eye . " A favor ? " " That 's right . We spared you the pain of looking at your ugly face . " Henri threw back his head and laughed . Though the clerk looked ready to say more , after studying Henri 's huge hands he thought better of it . Marc knew that dozens of voyageur brigades passed through Grand Portage on their way to company trading posts scattered across the North West Territory . Some were traveling west to the Red River Valley , others to the Far North-the famed Athabasca . The assortment of kettles , blankets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knives , cloth , and ribbons that the clerks packed depended on the destination of each brigade . " We 'd better get back to camp , Marc , " Henri said . But Marc was looking over his shoulder at the portage again . " What was that ? " he apologized . " Let 's get back to camp , " Henri repeated . " O.K. , " Marc agreed , but his mind was still on the nine-mile hike that awaited him tomorrow . Marc knew what tough carries could do . He 'd never forget what happened to a man named Lucian Galtier back on the Grand Calumet Portage . Trying to lift more than his muscles could stand , he 'd ripped open his stomach . Though the men pushed his intestines back in place and bandaged his middle with some gingham cloth , Galtier 's death was slow and painful . Marc could still picture in his mind the lonely hillside where they tied a broken paddle blade into a cross to mark his grave . When Marc and Henri returned to camp , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roderick Mackenzie 's men had completed that afternoon . According to the men , he 'd portaged two parcels of trade goods to Fort Charlotte-a distance of nine miles-and returned with two bundles of furs in only five hours . When the feat was mentioned again over supper , one of Henri 's canoe mates , Martin Ballanger , declared in an intentionally loud voice , " I ca n't see why anyone would make a fuss over a little carry . " Marc hated Ballanger . He was a greasy little man with close-set eyes who refused to mind his own business . Mackenzie 's men , who were camped next to Marc 's crew , suddenly quieted . Finally a tall fellow stood up . " Would you like to match the effort , Ballanger ? " " Why waste my time ? " Ballanger scoffed . " But I know someone who could double that weight . " When the man laughed , Ballanger bragged even more . " I 'll bet he could even handle five packs . " " And who might that be ? Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guessing what was coming next , glared at Ballanger , but the weaselly man went on . " I was thinking of my friend here , Monsieur Bonga . " " Henri Bonga ? " Murmurs rose from the far side of the campfire , and a second man asked , " Did you have a wager in mind ? " " Put your money where your mouth is , " Ballanger grinned . Though everyone had heard of Henri 's legendary strength , the enormity of the task set the odds against him at three to one . The contest began at dawn . Every man , woman and child in Grand Portage came out to watch . A chorus of encouragement rose from the crowd , as Ballanger helped Henri strap three bundles on his back and two across his chest . Marc hoisted his own packs in place . The rest of Marc 's brigade had already shouldered their own packs and headed up the trail . Henri turned to Marc . " How are you feeling ? " he asked . Marc could n't believe Henri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lifetime , yet his main worry was his young friend . " I 'm as ready as I 'll ever be , " Marc lied , trying to show more confidence than he felt . " Take it one pose at a time , " Henri winked and started up the trail . Marc was amazed at the big man 's pace . He marched past the first poses , or resting places , without breaking stride . Two famous landmarks-the parting trees and the fountain-were soon left in the distance , and Marc had to jog to keep up . Only after Henri passed through an open meadow and reached the steepest part of the hill did he begin to breathe heavily . Marc noticed the backs of Henri 's leggings were dark with sweat . " You can make it , " Marc called , looking down at the worn stones of the footpath . An hour later , the big man looked beaten . After balancing his load on a short resting pole at the next pose , Henri tried to sit down . But his packs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ? " Marc asked . The big man was wheezing like a winded horse , but he still managed to nod and smile . A few minutes later , Ballanger arrived . He had lagged behind , worried about losing his wager . " You ca n't quit now , " he hollered . " The last flat is just over that hill . " " Why do n't you shut- " Marc started to yell at Ballanger , but stopped when Henri once again rose to his feet . " One pose at a time , " he whispered to Marc . The calmness of Henri 's voice and the steadiness of his stride told Marc that the big man would make it . He knew there was no stopping Henri , for he was whistling softly now and walking with the ease of a gentleman strolling down a garden path . Marc adjusted his packs and hurried past the astonished Ballanger . This was an event Marc did n't want to miss . When Henri arrived at Fort Charlotte , cheers sounded throughout the stockade . Marc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain a legend in the canoe country . Even before the freight was lifted from Henri 's shoulders , Ballanger was collecting his bets . " To the greatest voyageur ever , " a man from Mackenzie 's crew shouted . As the crowd pressed tightly around Henri and helped him with his packs , he looked worried . But as soon as he caught Marc 's eye he smiled . " You made it , lad , " he called out . Then he chuckled . " But do n't you think it 's time to set your parcels down ? " Marc suddenly felt the weight of his packs . He 'd conquered the most famous portage in the North West without even thinking about it Out of concern for Henri , he 'd forgotten the pain of his own carry . Now for the first time he realized his calves were burning as if they 'd been flogged , and his neck ached . " Martin Ballanger , " Henri spoke loud enough to get everyone 's attention . Ballanger was counting his coins like a greedy child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Turn around , " the big man commanded . To the amusement of both crews , Henri strapped a pack over Ballanger 's shoulders . Ballanger frowned silently as Henri hooked a second pack around his front and placed a third across his shoulders . When Henri reached for the fourth parcel , Ballanger croaked , " No . " As Ballanger crumpled to his knees , Marc grinned . For once the fellow was getting what he deserved . " Enough , " Ballanger cried , wheeling his arms to balance himself , " enough ! " When Henri swung the last pack onto Ballanger 's shoulders , the little man toppled face-first into the dust . The crowd roared . The only thing visible under the pile of packs was a single , coin-clutched hand . " Now our work is done , " Henri declared . Then grinning in Marc 's direction , he added , " It 's a fine day , indeed . What do you say we take a look at the Pigeon River ? "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
