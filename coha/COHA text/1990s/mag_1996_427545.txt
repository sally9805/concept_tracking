Corporations have more right to your data than you do <p> BEVERLY DENNIS IS AN OHIO GRAND-mother and bona fide American consumer . Several years ago , she completed a questionnaire for the Metromail Corp. , a direct marketing firm , in order to get free product samples . In her responses , she disclosed things like her income level , date of birth , the fact that she was divorced , her interest in physical fitness , and choice of " personal care " products , according to a lawsuit she is filing . <p> Dennis got more than free product samples . She got a " sexually graphic and threatening " letter from a convicted rapist in a Texas penitentiary . It turned out he knew quite a lot about Dennis , thanks to her questionnaire . He had written his highly personalized letter after being assigned the task of entering data from the questionnaire by a Metromail subcontractor . The use of inmates to answer 800-number calls , process consumer information , and even act as telemarketers , it seems , is widespread . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prison , " Dennis later said in an interview , certainly would n't have filled it out . " <p> Dennis is suing Metromail and the Texas criminal system for " outrageous disregard of public safe and dangerous invasion of privacy , " among other It 's hard not to feel that she has a point . <p> In fact , the manipulation of personal data that have fed into the maw of the information society is , to an oft-used metaphor , like making sausage . If we y knew what was involved , we probably would want as little to do with the process as possible . The is , we do n't have that option . The relentless and collection , compilation , and selling of personal information are built into the texture of everyday life . You may imagine that you can keep your distance from the vacuum-like data intakes by making shrewd choices about when , where , and to whom you disclose . But unless you 're prepared to adopt a lifestyle like Theodore Kaczynski 's , you 're wrong . <p> Beverly Dennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience caused by the misappropriation of her data . But there 's evidence that other types of misuse could be even more harmful . <p> With rising public anxiety about the victimization of children , for example , parents and other concerned adults are noticing how easy it is to get data that could be put to sinister use . To dramatize the point , a Los Angeles television reporter recently purchased from Metromail a list of 5,500 children , with their family names and addresses . Not to make the exercise too subtle , the reporter placed the order in the name of Richard Allen Davis , the man convicted for abducting , sexually assaulting , and murdering 12-year-old Polly Klaas . <p> It 's hard to say precisely where these particular data originated . We do know that lists like this are compiled from such sources as the " birthday clubs " that retailers encourage parents to enroll their kids in , subscription lists for children 's magazines , and toy store discount cards . What is almost certain is that whoever provided the information did not realize he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The most alarming uses of personal data often involve the least obtrusive forms of collection . Take getting a prescription filled . Increasingly , this involves feeding the patients ' and physicians ' names , along with other identifying data on the people and drugs involved , into a computer . Sometimes the acknowledged purpose of the data entry is to determine whether the charges are covered by insurance . In some places , laws require prescription data to be fed into government systems aimed at curbing prescription drug abuse . But whatever the ostensible purposes , people lose control over their information once it enters the data stream . <p> Often pharmacists sell information to " switchers "  --  operations that find buyers for such data . Some switchers , for example , collate information on users of specific drugs for sale to manufacturers of over-the-counter companion drugs . Then manufacturers direct advertising appeals to the targeted patients . Are these practices beneficial to patients ? Conceivably , if the companion drug helps . Can they be dangerous ? Quite possibly , for those who use the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But for most Americans , the issue here is probably not whether these practices are medically beneficial . It is that people whose data are appropriated in these ways have no say in what happens to their information . Indeed , it 's not even legally theirs . Patients may have thought that their prescriptions were a matter between themselves and their pharmacists , but that idea is going the way of vinyl records . There is just too much demand for personal information , and there are too ' many sophisticated techniques for getting it . <p> Some may consider this the inevitable by-product of living in an information age . But these leaks can lead to authentic tragedies . John Doe , an AIDS sufferer , was a middle-level manager of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority ( SEPTA ) . He had disclosed his condition only to his immediate superior at SEPTA , someone he trusted . But then other managers at the organization noted that Doe 's charges on the employer-backed prescription plan were unusually high and had his account audited . The investigation showed that Doe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The result for Doe was stigmatization at work over matters that he had every right to keep to himself . Doe had maybe a year left in his work life , his attorney Clifford Boardman told Newsday , and every day was important to him . This disclosure took away his peace of mind . A federal jury awarded Doe $125,000 , but the verdict was overturned on appeal . " We hold that a self-insured employer 's need for access to employee prescription records ... outweighs an employee 's interest in keeping his prescription drug purchases confidential , " the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded . <p> Businesses are increasingly realizing there 's a gold mine in personal data . Fortunes await those who can devise slick ways for distinguishing who should receive consumer credit , and on what terms ; or for identifying profitable customers for insurance companies ; or for specifying the best targets for marketing campaigns . These incentives have led to the growth of vast industries that depend on personal information as the essential raw material . <p> The sources for the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call to an 800 number is apt to disclose the caller 's phone number , giving resourceful data collectors access to the caller 's name and address . One phone company recently created an electronic system that flashes information about the social characteristics of the caller 's neighborhood . Internet transactions and website visits also may enable data collectors to infer the caller 's identity . Every product coupon submitted for a rebate , every warranty slip filed with a manufacturer , every credit card sale-almost any identifiable fact about an American consumer  --  may provide grist for the commercial information mills . <p> Not all the sources are commercial enterprises . Charities , magazines , hospitals , and countless other not-for-profit organizations sell their data . Activist groups from right to left often sell lists of their supporters or trade them with other organizations . The U.S. Postal Service now routinely releases customers ' change-of-address information  --  typically without their knowledge  --  to businesses who want it . <p> State motor vehicle registrars have long realized that records they compile  --  under legal compul-sion-of accidents , driving infractions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn a pretty penny releasing driver data to insurance companies and the organizations that serve them . It makes financial sense ; millions of requests per year at several dollars apiece help offset many a state budget deficit . Record Sale <p> A typical mailing list company trumpets the availability of information on " 83 million families , selectable by income , age , credit card use , mail-order buying , number ( and age ) of children , type of automobile , type of home .... " For an additional price , the same broker will provide " ethnic name selection , " guessing the ethnicity of those in their databases by statistical analysis of names . Customers may wish to select , for example , names and phone numbers of all the black accountants in Washington , D.C. , or contributors to gay charities , or purchasers of products for incontinence . <p> The ability to deal with vast numbers of individuals , while still attending to the fine detail of individual cases , yields stunning capabilities . And it 's most alarming with medical data . The rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among insurers , employers , and other businesses  --  to avoid people who might develop costly diseases have fueled ferocious appetites for personal data . <p> In a case reported recently in Time , for example , a banker serving on a state health commission pulled a list of cancer patients in his area , determined which ones had loans with his bank , then called in the loans . And as with the AIDS sufferer mentioned earlier , prescription and other medical records are increasingly accessible to companies carrying medical insurance for their staffs . This dual role-employer and provider of medical insurance  --  tends inexorably to bring data together from relationships most of us would like to see hermetically walled off from one another . <p> In April 1996 , Newsday reporter John Riley told the story of Veronica , a patient whose psychotherapy for depression was covered by her employer . Like many in the same situation , Veronica was alarmed to learn that , to extend the treatment , her therapist had to provide details of her problems to the managed care company paying the bills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmacists ... must feed patient information up the system 's food chain to insurers who may , in turn , share it with each other , with employers and with information vendors in a virtually unregulated process . " <p> This is not to say the manipulation of personal data has no advantages . We can be offered useful products and services we would otherwise miss . But what is at stake are the legal and social arrangements that will shape technological changes now in course . The current framework simply does n't reflect the realities of a world where personal information has become the essential raw material for several major industries . <p> Of course , there are some important protections for personal information . The Privacy Act of 1974 , which gave individuals access to data held by government agencies and allowed them to challenge its accuracy , was a positive step . If this law has a salient flaw , it is its failure in practice to achieve what was a key element of its original intent-to prevent data collected for one purpose from being used for other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nothing so comprehensive as the Privacy Actexists for private-sector data . Coverage is piecemeal and chaotic . The occasional checks on appropriation of personal data  --  such as the right to review your credit record to make sure it 's accurate  --  found in one sector are lacking elsewhere . As medical privacy specialist Sheri Alpert has commented , one 's choices of video rentals are better protected under current American law than one 's medical records . Under the " Bork law , " passed after that judges video rental choices were revealed during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings , video customers have the right to " opt out " from disclosure . In most other commercial areas ( most medical contexts included ) personal data belong to whoever has possession of them . Thus many hospitals , like the pharmacies we mentioned earlier , sell personal data from their records . <p> Americans are certainly realizing their privacy is increasingly at risk . In September , the database firm Lexis-Nexis found itself in the midst of a firestorm of public complaint after people discovered the firm was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maiden names , addresses , and the like . Librarian Robert Gitlin told the Los Angeles Times , " It 's private information that I do n't want released without any opportunity to consent . " <p> Though worsening , this problem is not new . For years , many have sought omnibus legislation to establish a blanket right to privacy . They have failed , though , because privacy is a contested value ; the interest in protecting personal data often collides with other legitimate interests . My desire to keep my medical history to myself , for example , will always be at odds with the interests of insurers in auditing the care I receive . Any reasonable policy would give both privacy and " right-to-know " interests their due . Righting the Wrong <p> That 's why we propose the creation of personal property rights that would supersede the commercial exploitation of personal information . Without express authorization from the subject , no personal data could be sold or traded from any file for any commercial purpose . Release of credit card data to credit reporting agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the resale of records from mail order firms to direct marketing firms would all be prohibited  --  unless the release of such data was explicitly authorized by the individual in question . <p> The immediate result of such a principle would be a new  --  and entirely healthy-set of choices and tensions . People would have to take careful stock of their interests in the use of their data , weighing privacy interests against other considerations . Imagine , for example , a consumer put off by a credit bureau 's collection of information on her retail accounts , or unable to resolve a dispute with the credit bureau over her records . She could choose to prevent the release of further data to credit bureaus , or to prevent the current bureau from selling further reports . The bureau might then have the right to report that the record was sealed at the consumer 's request , but no more . <p> Of course , consumers would have to weigh the consequences of their decisions  --  forgoing the benefits of having a credit record , or risking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would charge them a higher rate of interest . Similarly , those denying their medical histories to insurance reporting firms might well find access to some forms of insurance blocked , or the costs of coverage raised . Because many consumers would probably choose to reap the benefits of releasing their information , commerce would not come grinding to a halt . But this system would place the onus of decision squarely where it belongs-on the individual who provides the data . <p> The information industry would then have incentives to make their activities acceptable to the people whose information they take , instead of just collecting it without their knowledge or permission . The credit reporting industry would have to sell its services to the public-presumably by promising more accurate , open reporting practices and by calling attention to the benefits of having an active and complete credit record . Direct marketers would have to convince the public that their attentions were , on balance , an advantage to the customer . Businesses would need to convince customers that the sale of their information really worked to their advantage-if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One end result of this new right would be a decrease in the quantity of privacy-invading experiences , from junk telephone calls to unwanted appropriations of medical information , and a rise in their quality  --  that is , the potential they will actually benefit the individual concerned . <p> Some legislative straws in the wind suggest that public opinion may now be open to a right like the one proposed here . GOP Congressman Bob Franks has proposed a bill to require parental consent before children 's data can be commercialized . New Jersey state Sen. Richard Codey last February introduced a bill barring companies from renting or selling consumer names " without prior written or electronic consent " from the party concerned . About the same time , the Minnesota legislature was considering a similar bill applying to on-line service companies . <p> The courts are also starting to address the problem . In a case against Radio Shack , Robert Beken won $1,000 in damages for misuse of his personal data . Beken had written a contract on the back of his check to the electronics chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mailing list or send him any advertisements or mailings . The court rejected Radio Shack 's defense that the clerk accepting the check had no authority to enter into such a contract with Beken . <p> But we believe that court decisions or piecemeal legislation will never provide the protection that would be afforded by a comprehensive right . The right we propose would not categorically block any of the useful forms of data exchange underlying today 's information society . Nor would it prevent any organization from maintaining its own files on clients or customers  --  provided that the data involved were provided by , or with the consent of , those concerned . It would simply require their permission before their data could be released . <p> Who could take exception to the institution of personal data rights ? Only the vast industries that now appropriate personal data for free . Information-collecting industries have often sought immunity from privacy-protecting legislation on freedom of expression grounds . But it hardly makes sense to identify the same value in " commercial speech " as in expression of opinion on public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , for example , should detract from the right of journalists or others to obtain personal data on public figures for news stories or other forms of public discussion . <p> This measure would n't solve all the sticky policy dilemmas associated with privacy protection . Some personal data no doubt should never be marketed for commercial use  --  those on children , for example , or individuals ' DNA profiles . But establishing a general property right in personal data would create a potent new weapon for ordinary Americans to defend themselves against pressures on their privacy . With the information age hitting high gear in the 1990s , there 's only so much time to get the genie back in the bottle . Otherwise , we will just have to adjust to living in see-through houses on the information highway . <p> BY JAMES RULE AND LAWRENCE HUNTER <p> <p> RULE is a professor of sociology at SUNY , Stony Brook , and is an editor of Dissent <p> LAWRENCE HUNTER is a computer scientist at of Health , and the Washington , D.C. chapter Social Responsibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
