Every day , millions of dismayed Americans read the news that acid rain is creating an aquatic " silent spring " in the northeastern U.S. Thousands of lakes are dead , with thousands more soon to die . Acid rain is wiping out our forests . The perception of mounting environmental devastation has created an overwhelming sense of urgency . The feeling is , " For heaven 's sake , stop talking about it and do something before we kill everything ! " The trouble is , none of this news of impending environmental disaster is true . Political activists from the Sierra Club , National Audubon Society , and other organizations have worked diligently to create the public perception that it is . Some scientists have helped to fuel the flames of panic . In 1980 , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) stated that acid rain had increased the average acidity of northeastern lakes a hundredfold over the last 40 years . In 1981 , the National Research Council claimed that the number of acidified lakes would double by 1990 . However , National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research the " problem " realized that the publicly accepted claims of disaster were unsubstantiated . There was no scientific assessment of acid rain 's effects on which to base claims of disaster  --  or any claims at all , for that matter . Accordingly , NAPAP spent hundreds of millions of dollars to develop the first census of acid rain 's state-of-the-environment and found : * There are 240 critically acidic lakes out of more than 7,000 northeastern lakes , not the thousands claimed . * The average lake is as acidic as it was prior to the Industrial Era ( some have become more acidic , some less over time ) , not 100 times more acidic as claimed . * Only 35,000 of 200,000,000 acres of eastern lakes are critically acidic. * Most of this acidic water is in Florida . Yet , the rain in Florida is among the least acidic in the eastern U.S.  --  three times less so than in the Adirondacks. * The amount of acidic water is not changing with time ; thousands of additional lakes are not becoming acidic as claimed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal pollutant that creates acid rain has been halved  --  20,000,000 tons , rather than 40,000,000 per year . The new revisions will make no difference in the amount of acid rain 30-40 years from now . * All of the acidic lakes in the northeastern U.S. can be limed for $500,000 a year , compared to billions of dollars for an elaborate government acid rain program . Meanwhile , forest decline is extensive in many unpolluted regions of the world , whereas trees in highly polluted ones ( i.e. , metropolitan areas ) are largely unaffected . The nitrogen in acid rain is fertilizing 300,000,000 acres of eastern forest . This may have a negative effect for about 0.1% of the forest . Enhanced growth by nitrogen fertilization may result in increased winter damage for 300,000 acres of high-altitude spruce-fir forest . It is only common sense to conclude , therefor , that an expensive crash program to further accelerate the current rate of reduction of acid rain is not justified . Yet , in major media sources such as Newsweek and The New York Times , political activists passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAPAP has made no progress at all . They say that NAPAP was a waste of time and only has proven that acid rain is the " crisis " it was " known to be " prior to the inception of NAPAP a decade ago . In the few cases where responsible scientists manage to report the facts , it is claimed that NAPAP 's results are politically tainted  --  under-representing the effects of acid rain . It was in this atmosphere that Congress passed a new Clean Air Act in 1990 , in large part to allay manufactured fears of acid rain . What Congress is trying to cover up is the fact that this new legislation will cost our nation , conservatively , $40,000,000,000 a year . MANUFACTURED CRISES Acid rain is only one of a dozen manufactured crises ranging from toxic waste to chemical poisoning of food and global warming . Consistently , Americans are led to believe that they must submit to comprehensive regulation by an " elite " of environmental experts if our planet is to be saved . The real crisis , however , appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present world order  --  which places power in the hands of individuals  --  as foolhardy . They manipulate science and other institutions to convince Americans that it is necessary to sacrifice their rights of self-determination for some " greater good " like environmental protection . Environmentalism has become more than just a cause ; it is the preeminent American political party . Ron Arnold , author of Ecology Wars , reports that the major environmental organizations meet regularly to coordinate their activities . According to Rep. William E. Dannemeyer ( R.-Calif. ) , the top 12 groups that comprise the base of support for the Environmental Party are four times bigger than the combined Democratic and Republican Parties . " All told , the Environmental Party has an operating budget of $336,300,000 ( 1988 ) and a donor base of 12,959,000 . That 's nearly $250,000,000 more than the Republican and Democratic Parties combined and a donor base of some 10,000,000 persons more " About 90% of these funds go to support political activities , not ecological improvement . Yet , members of the Environmental Party have established themselves as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Planet Earth . Their opponents , usually American businessmen , are portrayed as Darth Vaders in three-piece suits  --  special interests opposed to the common good . The Environmental Party is difficult to argue with because it embraces a nominal cause that has no opposition . Who wants foul air , dirty water , and reckless disposal of toxic wastes ? Who relishes questioning it and being automatically labeled an enemy of Mother Nature ? The last group that wants to fight on these uneven terms is the business community . Nevertheless , confrontation can not be avoided because the Environmental Party has targeted free enterprise for extinction . If one deliberately were trying to create a means to destroy free enterprise ( and its attendant wealth and freedoms ) , one could not come up with a better killing machine than the Environmental Party . Indeed , from the very beginning , business and industry learned that fighting back in self-defense is even worse than doing nothing . Then , there are those who have decided that if you ca n't beat " em , join " em ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party comes from private-sector foundations . To understand government 's role as an Environmental Party ally , it is helpful to think of government as the business of regulation . Like all businesses , the business of regulation seeks expansion . Yet , even governmental growth is not risk-free . It has the inherent liability of incurring the displeasure of the consumer ( taxpayer ) by increasing the cost ( taxes ) of the product . Environmental legislation , however , is like manna from heaven  --  it is principally an off-budget tax . The government thus is perceived as working for the common good , literally for free . To government , the well-known Environmental Party line is an irresistible siren 's song : " Government must regulate all human activity . The masses must obey the environmental bureaucracy  --  it knows what is " best . " Sacrifice must be made for the " just cause . " There are only five to 10 years before it is too late to save the planet from the masses who inhabit it . " Crises are the time-honored formula by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who observed that " hastiness and superficiality  --  these are the psychic diseases of the 20th century and more than anywhere else this is manifested in the press . " Businessmen would do well to heed his warning , for they have few enough friends in the media these days . A report of the Media Institute shows that " Television almost never portrays business as a socially useful ... activity . " Americans love the underdog . Stories of the " common citizen " battling against unscrupulous capitalists and industrial giants are popular and pay big dividends for the media with little accompanying risk . The myth of the great lobbying power of the " timber barons , " " oil monopolies , " and " mining kings " support the image of a David vs . Goliath conflict  --  the battle between good and evil . Since the Environmental Party provides an endless source of prepackaged , easy-to-report disasters  --  clear-cut cases of conflict between good and evil for eager consumption by the public  --  it and the media are natural friends and allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public with a never-ending series of fictitious ecological disasters . Invariably , the businessman and free enterprise are to blame . The Environmental Party and the mass media also conspire to provide government with a clear mandate to micromanage all aspects of human activity . While scientific truth is not established by vote , political reality is . The Environmental Party , government , and mass media represent a triad of self-interest that excludes the public interest . They are succeeding in dismantling democracy and free choice where all previous efforts have failed . The only way to defeat them is by grass-roots activism through private special-interest organizations . These groups , though small and often unknown to the general public , can have an important influence on the issues , especially ecological ones that have become mired in politics and media hype . The brilliance of Environmental Party strategy lies in its ongoing attempt to discredit science and government and persuade the public habitually to place trust in the proclamations of these political activists . A survey by the Democratic research firm of Marttila &; Kiley , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1990 , found that only 15% of the American public trusts what government scientists say ; six percent trusts scientists seen as representing industry ; 68% implicitly believes political activists ; and 67% agrees with the statement : " Threats to the environment are as serious as environmental groups say they are . " Virtually all scientific research is funded by industry and government . Since the public no longer trusts these sources , it is apt to accept the " good faith " assertions of political activists as fact . DIVERTING ATTENTION FROM REAL DANGERS In 1990 , Pres. Bush planted an elm in Indianapolis on Earth Day . He claimed that the tree was a symbol of the environment , and of the " problem " of global warming . The " green " elite that informs the President got part of it right : The elm tree does represent a problem  --  the devastation resulting from the Environmental Party 's sham ecological ethic . The President 's elm also is representative of the specific dilemma faced by eastern forests : They may die soon  --  not from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . There are 150,000,000 acres of eastern hardwoods that have been assaulted in recent years by a variety of imported diseases and pests . Before the chestnut ( the most valuable tree in the eastern forests ) was eliminated by blight , an enterprising squirrel could have gone from Maine to Georgia on the branches of chestnut trees , coming down only to cross rivers . Oak , which has replaced much of the elm and chestnut , is being devastated by the gypsy moth . Beech bark disease from Canada is making its way across the rest of North America after being introduced into Nova Scotia from Europe . Meanwhile , the Environmental Party bemoans acid rain 's hypothetical risk to about 300,000 acres of high-altitude spruce-fir forest from winter injury due to nitrogen fertilization as being a major issue . Inflated fears about acid rain distract us from being concerned about the remaining 18,000,000 acres of spruce-fir forest that literally are being chewed up by imported insect pests . For example , 90% of the mature fir trees in the Southern Appalachians are dead or dying because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acres of red spruce in Maine and many more millions of acres in Canada . While the Environmental Party diverted our attention and resources to acid rain , in 1986 , the zebra mussel was introduced into our lakes from Norway . A comparison of the problems represented by acid rain and the zebra mussel is in order . It is probable that acid rain acts to increase the acidity of naturally acid , " fishless " waters . It also may acidify a very small percentage of low-productivity waters . However , the Environmental Party has portrayed lakes that cover a few tens of thousands of acres  --  most of which we now know to be naturally acidic  --  as an ecological Armageddon . The zebra mussel , on the other hand , is enormously proliferate and feeds on the plankton food base of aquatic ecosystems . It has no natural enemies . In just a few years , it has spread rapidly to eat the plankton base of the of the aquatic food chain , decreasing the productivity of tens of millions of acres of water . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply systems and industry . Biologists see no way to prevent the zebra mussel from taking over our more than 100,000,000 acres of high-productivity freshwater . If the Environmental Party were a genuine champion of the environment , it would not be preoccupied with multimillion-dollar acid rain controls or its other pet concerns such as the spotted owl and the snail darter . It would not embrace nominal environmental issues that are used to acquire control over vital industrial activities and would not ignore greater environmental problems just because they can not be used to achieve such control . The truth is that it is dominated by false prophets whose concern for the environment masks its real agenda , social engineering , and ultimate goal , power . During the debate over the Clean Air Act of 1990 , Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D.-N.Y. ) pointed to the key problem when dealing with the Environmental Party  --  the triumph of process over reason . He declared that " environmental legislation created over the last 20 years has typically forbidden any analysis of cost or has demonstrated no concern for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic and science to correctly identify difficulties or decide which responses might do more harm than good . It ruthlessly pursues any legislation that provides the means not just to control economic activity , but all forms of human behavior . The result is that the Environmental Party has become the absolute secular power of the country . Any activity can be construed as unacceptably damaging to the environment . Pull one fish out of a lake , cut one tree , or plant a field and you can be said to have harmed the environment . If you breathe , you exhale CO sub 2 and allegedly cause global warming . The Environmental Party did not acquire power all at once ; it took its lead from bureaucracy . Starting with the first Federal water pollution law in 1948 , government has given itself increasing authority to regulate everything from noise to wildlife . With the passage of the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 and Superfund ( the Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ) , government now has the authority to regulate literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government by gradually expanding control over well-known ecological organizations such as the Sierra Club , National Audubon Society , and National Wildlife Federation ( NWF ) . These groups began as bona fide organizations promoting wise use  --  i.e. , conservation of the land  --  but have abandoned , as former NWF president Ray Arnett and others have testified , conservation education for the more tempting pursuits of political advocacy and lobbying . THE NEW WORLD ORDER : COLOR IT GREEN What values do the Environmental Party advocate ? According to Ron Arnold , " America 's new-found sensitivity to nature came packaged in a strongly anti-industry , anti-people wrapper . It came with a gut feeling that people are no damn good , that everything we do damages nature and that we must be stopped before we totally destroy the Earth . " Environmentalist Dennis Hayes proclaimed on the first Earth Day , " We feel that Earth Day has failed if it stops at pollution , if it does n't serve as a catalyst in changing the values of society . " In his 1968 book The Population Bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreword by Sierra Club executive director David Brower ) , Paul Ehrlich called people a " cancer " on the Earth . He repeatedly asserted that " the battle to feed humanity is already lost . " He predicted that the planet would run out of food by 1977 , after which world population would begin to starve back to 2,000,000,000 by 2025 . To stave off this disaster , Ehrlich prescribed a form of global triage . He claimed that the Third World was hopeless and should be helped to die by denying food and technology and reducing the birth rate through mandatory birth control and sterilization . The nations that were not beyond hope would have only mandatory birth control . Government experts would decide who could reproduce . In 1968 , Ehrlich did not think that we were " mature " enough for this approach  --  yet . Now , nearly a quarter of a century later , the world has not come to an end . Undeterred by his enormous capacity for error , however , Ehrlich has republished his thesis ( The Population Explosion , 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has retained his hallowed status as a prophet of the future , even receiving the 1990 MacArthur Foundation genius award . With the help of Ehrlich and others like him , the Environmental Party is working hard to make its dismal world vision come true . For example , one of the 12 pieces of legislation it uses to rate Washington legislators is a bill to fund the United Nations ' program of compulsory sterilization in Third World countries receiving aid . The UN 's alliance with the Environmental Party does n't end with schemes to kill off or stunt the Third World population . The stated fundamental goal of its international convention on global warming is no less than the development of a statist global government that will control every activity of life in all countries . The leading 17 industrial nations have signed an agreement in principle to implement such a plan to stave off the alleged horrors of global warming , which is but another manufactured environmental crisis whose real purpose is social engineering . World-class agronomists , geologists , and environmental scientists of the UN 's Intergovernmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if global warming occurs to the degree and extent that the doomsday models predict , it will be of great benefit to the world ! What these IPCC data mean for the U.S. alone is an increase of $12,000,000,000 per year in food production , $30-50,000,000,000 per year in water resources , an increase in wood of 80,000,000,000 cubic feet , and more than $500,000,000,000 in wood by 2050 . ( These prospects may be merely academic , however , since a number of scientists admit that , if we look at the last 50 years , rather than the century average as is customary , temperatures are not increasing . ) Nevertheless , the well-publicized plans of the UN and the Environmental Party require Third World nations to place large areas into " forever wild " nature preserves to prevent their dire and , predictably , false warnings about global warming from coming true . Additionally , these countries will be denied use of their remaining natural resources by the banning of primitive slash-and-burn practices and modern agricultural and transportation technologies based on fossil fuels  --  ostensibly to minimize emissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action is to prevent Third World countries from becoming developed . The UN 's and the Environmental Party 's plan effectively blocks them from following the developed nations through the demographic transition to prosperity and near-zero population growth rates . The plan is a self-fulfilling prophesy . Underdeveloped nations will remain underdeveloped , and will retain low economic growth , high population rates , poverty , and concomitant environmental devastation . The Environmental Party has given us a new definition of social responsibility , one that has little to do with people and much to do with rain forests , sea turtles , dolphins , and spotted owls . It has also given us a new definition of man , one that has important religious significance . It was the misanthropic core philosophy of the new environmentalism in the 1970s that originally led Richard Neuhaus ( a founder of National Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam ) to write In Defense of People , in which he pointed out that this movement puts the " rights of nature " above the " rights of man . " Today , we also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world order , the lost rights of the many are concentrated into the hands of the " knowing few " who administer " the rights of nature . " The core of this environmental totalitarianism is anti-God , even though some general Judeo-Christian or other religious principles are acknowledged and even venerated by many Environmental Party members . It does not love people , science , or technology . It wants to replace God with its own authority and eliminate free choice . It worships Creation , but not the Creator . The Environmental Party does not respect the sanctity of science . It manipulates science as a tool of persuasion . It does not respect the sanctity of the environment . It manufactures environmental crises as a means of gaining control over the resources that support modern civilization . One of the outcomes of this siege on civilization is the destruction of the environment . The Environmental Party does not respect the sanctity of an individual 's right to self-determination . It holds that , given the truth , " we the people " do not have the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that ability . The Environmental Party views the present world order  --  which places power in the hands of the people  --  as dangerous and unacceptable . Its leaders must feel ironic satisfaction in using free and democratic institutions to force through a form of boot camp in which they break people down and remake them in a new " green " image . Those same leaders know that " the only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing . " Let us prove them right  --  not by doing nothing , but by defeating the Environmental Party 's bid for power .
