<p> Paul Verhoeven has a reputation as Attila the Director , slashing his way through mean streets and bed sheets alike , but in person , he looks more like a visiting professor in the film department of some Midwestern college . In conversation , the bespectacled 50-year-old Dutch director best known for the hyperviolent blockbusters " RoboCop " and " Total Recall " is breezy , quick-witted and , currently , energized by the furor over his new film , " Basic Instinct , " which opens today . <p> Since it went into production last winter , the brutal sexual thriller , starring Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone , has been the target of protests and disruptions by gay rights activists objecting to the script 's depiction of bisexual women and lesbian characters as crazed killers who hate men . The outrage is expected to continue in several cities today and some groups have threatened action at the Oscar ceremonies March 30 . <p> The Motion Picture Association of America 's ratings board also stepped into the fray , initially saddling " Basic Instinct " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial death , since most theaters ( particularly those in malls ) wo n't show NC-17 films , and media outlets refuse to advertise and most video outlets do n't carry them  --  all factors that substantially diminish a film 's potential profits . <p> The MPAA deemed " Basic Instinct " sexually explicit and extremely violent , citing a long sex scene between Stone and Douglas as " very graphic , very explicit and beyond the boundaries . " With his contract obligating him to bring in an R-rated film , Verhoeven did some prudent pruning  --  a task he 's practiced since he started making films here in 1987  --  both " RoboCop " and " Total Recall " were originally rated X for excessive violence . <p> " You can probably criticize ' Basic Instinct ' more for its overtly direct , over-the-top heterosexual sex , " Verhoeven says , noting that there are same-sex scenes in the movie , " but everybody thinks the problem will be on the other side . " <p> That " other side , " of course , is what the protesters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystery 's ending . Stone plays a brilliant , manipulative , bisexual author who is the primary suspect in a string of murders ; ironically , Verhoeven 's last Dutch film , " The Fourth Man , " also featured a brilliant , manipulative , bisexual author ( actor Jeroen Krabbe ) who is the victim of a serial predator . <p> When he first read Joe Eszterhas 's $ 3 million script , Verhoeven did n't foresee trouble . " It was a thriller with a new angle  --  instead of using heterosexual characters , it would prominently feature one bisexual character , which would give you new plotting points and elements , new possibilities from a dramatic structural viewpoint because suddenly other relationships exist . It was innovative , though the basic material is not that far away from movies like ' Sea of Love ' or Eszterhas 's ' Jagged Edge . ' " <p> " So I never saw Stone 's sexual identity as more than a plot point , " Verhoeven insists . In fact , after " RoboCop " and " Total Recall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something simple , not to relax  --  moviemaking is not relaxing  --  but to change moods , to go from a big symphony to a chamber orchestra . That 's how it felt to me . <p> " But everything about it was difficult from the beginning , " he says somberly . " It started as a controversy and it never stopped . " <p> Part of the problem , Verhoeven suggests , is that European filmmakers have long used sexual preference  --  " or lack of sexual preference "  --  as a plot device and , he says , " in the ' 60s and ' 70s , bias and prejudice that people had about homosexuality slowly disappeared , certainly in my country . " Gerard Reve , whose bestselling novel inspired " The Fourth Man , " is one of the most respected writers in Holland and has been openly gay since the ' 50s . " When I got ' Basic Instinct , ' I thought , here we have an American writer who feels exactly the same , realizes that sexual preference is not an issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pirated " Basic Instinct " scripts began circulating in Hollywood , and when gay rights activists saw them , the protests began . Precipitously , says Verhoeven . " Even as a director , it 's difficult to read a script , which is a blueprint . You build your house using the blueprint , and the house and the blueprint are very different , I think . " <p> Verhoeven was particularly upset with protesters who took dialogue out of context . " You can take lines out of the Gospel ' proving ' that Jesus was not an advocate of peace but a guerrilla fighter and Jewish insurrectionist , " he says . ( Verhoeven is currently developing several historical projects , including one about Jesus , another about the explorer-militarist Cortez , and a Crusades-focused epic starring pal Arnold Schwarzenegger . ) <p> After a midsummer meeting of Verhoeven , Eszterhas and representatives of the National Organization for Women , Queer Nation , Act-Up and the Committee United Against Violence , the screenwriter " saw the light " and decided " to make a better and more socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the script , changing the sex of three minor characters and having Douglas 's detective request permission before a rough heterosexual encounter . <p> Eszterhas insisted the changes did not affect " Basic Instinct 's " dramatic structure but Verhoeven  --  who unsuccessfully pushed for the inclusion of a lesbian love scene  --  refused to make any changes . <p> " It was an unnecessary move , " says Verhoeven . " I told him he was making something really good really bad . When Joe proposed his changes and when I refused them , that was the last conversation we had . " <p> The director says he 's bothered by critics ' lack of differentiation " between what is politically correct in a movie and politically correct in a character . A character is a character , and hopefully characters have some problems with themselves or the world because otherwise they do n't promote or propel any drama . If everybody 's wonderful , we would n't make any dramas . <p> " Like a lot of people , I 'm more attracted to the drama of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , " Verhoeven adds . " You need that as well for the old Testament or Shakespeare or the Iliad . ... That these people are not okay does not mean the script is not okay ; the script is using them to get to certain situations . " <p> In fact , no one familiar with Verhoeven 's Dutch films would have been surprised at his strange brew of explicit sex , brutal violence and extreme passion . His very first film , 1974 's " Turkish Delight , " was violent , sexual , replete with nudity and , like most of Verhoeven 's earlier films , based on a novel . It also garnered a Best Foreign Language Film nomination from the Oscar folks , who now may be wishing they 'd never heard of him . <p> Both " Spetters " and " The Fourth Man " feature hetero/homo sex scenes ( a violent homosexual rape in " Spetters " was severely edited to avoid an X ) . Verhoeven 's first English-language film , 1986 's " Flesh Blood , " also provoked a ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Verhoeven , who earned a doctorate in mathematics and physics at the University of Leiden , where he began making films with student friends , makes a return to sexual themes after their absence in " RoboCop " and " Total Recall " and , he says , " I shot it just as I would have shot it in Europe . " <p> Well , not exactly . In his Dutch films , Verhoeven has always included frontal nudity of his male actors . " I would have preferred it because I feel when you do female nudity , you should do as much male nudity , otherwise I feel it 's exploitive . At least we saw all the rest of Michael from behind . " <p> Douglas , who lost 25 pounds preparing for a $ 15 million role that exposes his best side , had a contract requirement forbidding frontal nudity . Showing Douglas 's front side " is not essential to the story , " Verhoeven notes . <p> As for the minor cuts  --  mostly what he calls " thrusting " scenes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie think what 's left is more than enough . We were always aware that certain shots we were doing would not be acceptable here , " but they were shot anyways and will be included in the European versions of " Basic Instinct . " <p> " The violence may be more of an issue in Europe these days , " says Verhoeven . " They are more critical of it there than in the United States . " <p> Verhoeven sees himself as an American filmmaker now and his biggest commercial successes have reflected the kind of visceral American B-movies he grew up on after World War II . <p> " It was a very simple thing that happened , " Verhoeven explains . " I felt strongly when I came to the United States that my knowledge of the English language was too limited to do really good dialogue . I felt that I was hindered in listening to people 's speech , that I could not get the nuances of the language , of the intonation . I could not really hear if people were talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So I decided it was much better to start with a movie where that was not essential . Also , I felt I did not know enough about American life to be clear about the cultural environment and sociological circumstances , so doing two movies set in the future was like a protection element . Who can check me out on the future ? It 's another world , and different rules . <p> " This gave me time  --  four years  --  to learn and to see what the United States was about , to listen , to try to have a better ear for dialogue , " Verhoeven says . " When I had done both movies , I felt it was time , that I was able to do something more normal , where people were in a normal environment . I had the feeling that I was standing backwards a little bit and concentrating on action , adventure and the future . Now I feel more confident  --  my basic emotions are more here than in ' Total Recall . ' <p> " Nothing here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
