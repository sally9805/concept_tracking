Well Favored Gentleman Chapter One Scotland , 1800 Someone held a knife to his throat . Ian Fairchild snapped out of his deep slumber and held himself perfectly still , eyes closed and breathing even in a parody of sleep . Someone held a knife to his throat , and it was n't the first time , but this time he 'd been caught by surprise . He had n't had time to make enemies in Scotland . He 'd arrived only today , and had found his father , the only person here who would gladly kill him , too sick to leave his bed . So who was who had slipped into his bed chamber as the hour struck midnight ? Carefully he opened his eyes a slit -- and stared into the face of a ghost . A lovely , feminine , fiercely determined ghost , if her expression was anything to go by . His eyes widened . " You 're an idiot , Ian . " He spoke aloud , seeing no harm in addressing a phantom and finding the sound of his own voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And he tried to move to prove it . He could n't . The ghost sat on his chest , the dream held him in thrall , and he could n't bloody move . A normal turn of events in a dream , he supposed . If only that steel pressed against his windpipe did n't feel so cold and so real . If only he did n't feel so . . . odd . More than sleepy , he was drifting , illogically relaxed beneath the threat of violence . He blinked , bringing the phantom into focus . Wisps of hair sprang defiantly from her hairline . Her features were angular : square jawline , sharp cheekbones , wide mouth . Her eyes slanted up , her brows slanted up , her snub nose rose to a little point . A fascinating face , one filled with character and lively convictions . Not ghostly at all . " I know who you are . You 're dead . You 're Lady Alanna . " Both of her hands gripped that knife . He could see them in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of her name . Fear cleared his brain for one brief moment . The tip of that imaginary blade seemed so very honed . " Careful , there . We would n't want a bloody accident . " " No accident at all . " Her voice was husky , touched by a defiant Scottish accent , and it sounded real , too . This was the most vivid dream he 'd ever had . " Lady Alanna . I did n't think I 'd get to meet you . You 're prettier than your portrait . " " A compliment from a Fairchild . " The dream knife nudged close to his jugular . " I value that as it deserves . Sharp-tongued and prudent as well as pretty . The portrait had portrayed her as a girl balanced on the cusp of maturity , looking eagerly toward the day she would inherit Fionnaway Manor . But she had disappeared on the eve of her seventeenth birthday , never to be seen again . In a bit of dream magic , she now appeared to him all grown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piquant features and her generous curves . It found a companion flame in the red of her hair , and her large eyes were the color of the sea before an encroaching storm . Yet she watched him as cautiously as one watches a trapped wolf . With justification . He could be a dangerous man , but she did n't know that . Her wariness came from having known his father , and from the Fairchilds ' well reserved reputation . His family were as famous as the Borgias , and for much the same reasons . The desire for money and power ruled them ; no crime was too heinous when committed in the name of the Fairchild pocketbook . Everyone he had met this day had watched him , waiting for his pleasant facade to peel away and show him to be as despicable as his father . For to day , at least , he had managed to recall the values his mother had taught him . But Lady Alanna and the residents of Fionnaway were right to treat him gingerly ; sometimes the Fairchild blood prevailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " boo " was almost irresistible . Only that nervous , two-handed grip on the knife stopped him . " You seem worried . What 's wrong , sweet lady ? " " You were n't supposed to be awake . " " I 'm a light sleeper . " " Yes , but the smoke was supposed to . . . " " To what ? " His mind suddenly sharpened , and he noted the haze around her figure . He noted , also , an odor he had not smelled since India . Hashish . Someone had tried to drug him . He considered the woman leaning one knee on his chest . She had tried to drug him , and she had done a very good job . He was drugged .
