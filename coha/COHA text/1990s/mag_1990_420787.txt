Section : SOCIETY RELIGION With babes in arms and doubts in mind , a generation looks to religion <p> Snuggled between a 12-story hotel and the Moorish-style city hall in downtown Pasadena , Calif. , All Isaints Episcopal Church is that rare thing within mainline Protestant denominations : a growing , babyboomer congregation . Ninety-eight percent of its 3,000 members attended college and more than half have schooling beyond a bachelor 's degree . Less than a third were born Episcopalians , but that hardly matters . This is the l990s , an age of mix ' em , match ' em salad-bar spirituality  --  Quakerpalians , charismatic Catholics , New Age Jews  --  where brand loyalty is a doctrine of the past and the customer is king . <p> What counts on the Sabbath Day , if a church or synagogue is to attract its share of the baby-boom market , is not the name on the door but the programs inside . All Saints , for example , bills itself as a " peace and justice church " and offers at least 20 " ministries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union Station Homeless Shelter to GALAS , a gay and lesbian fellowship . Consciously or not , they are doing God 's work here on earth ; the churches offer a structure for service . Other churches emphasize self-improvement : adult education , lectures and organized athletics dominate the weekly calendar . In many congregations , the path to God runs through the basement where the addicted gather for 12-step programs for recovering alcoholics , workaholics , chocoholics , the divorced , codependents and other victims of the fast-track 1990s . For singles , church is rapidly becoming the place of choice to meet and marry kindred spirits . <p> Above all , however , the return to religion is fueled by the boomers ' experiences of becoming parents  --  and the realization that children need a place where they can learn solid values and make friends with peers who share them . Kris Womer , 29 , did n't get much religion as a child but joined The Village Presbyterian Church in Prairie Village , Kans. , because " I wanted my kids to have the knowledge of religion I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this crazy world , any kind of positive influence you can give your children is worth the time . " <p> Like many of her generation , attorney Becky Tilden stopped attending church when she went off to college . " Sunday mornings at the sorority house consisted of talking about your dates of Saturday night , " she recalls . " People did n't go to church . " But after the birth of their son , Dan , Becky and her husband , Jim , also a lawyer , saw a need to make quality time for God in their dual-career lives . " Coming to church every Sunday is really important for our little three-person family unit , " says Becky . <p> For some who came of age in the ' 60s , the return to religion is tempered by their experiences in the counterculture . Writer Beth Clements has made the journey from childhood Presbyterian to postgraduate Buddhist to middle-aged Episcopalian . Because she had learned spiritual discipline through meditation , Clements found that she could translate " the rituals that I 'd listened to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and give them new meaning . " <p> Tried souls : That search for meaning is a powerful motivation to return to the pews . In the throes of a midlife re-evaluation , Ecclesiastes  --  " A time for everything under heaven "  --  is suddenly relevant . David and Deborah Robboy , both 43 , joined a fairly new synagogue in Portland , Ore. , last year when David felt a need to stop and reassess his life . " I 've reached a certain level of success , " he says , " and what does it all mean ? " Such are the questions that try men 's souls . And a congregation that addresses them  --  in a nonthreatening manner  --  is bound for glory . At Village Presbyterian , Pastor Timothy J. Galligan finds that " Boomers are looking for a religious experience that makes sense of their lives and gives them some answers to their questions . To the extent that a church can do that , it will be successful . " <p> Like an outsize herd of grazing sheep , the 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into during their much-studied march toward middle age . It was for them that their postwar parents moved to the suburbs , creating the new churches and synagogues that symbolized the ' 50s ' vaunted religious revival . Now once again involved with organized religion , they are altering the nation 's churches and synagogues in ways both troubling and hopeful . <p> According to the best study to date , funded by the Lilly Endowment , one third never left church at all ; many merely switched denominational allegiance . The most steadfast of these " loyalists , " reports sociologist Wade Clark Roof of the University of California , Santa Barbara , are conservative Protestants  --  people who were less mobile in their youth , less likely to attend college and , even when they did , less prone to taking up alternative lifestyles and enthusiasms . By contrast , liberal mainline Protestants suffered a serious hemorrhage  --  as many as one in four Methodists and Presbyterians switched allegiance or dropped religion entirely . Roman Catholics wandered in and out , becoming highly selective in what they would accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lost generation . Altogether , Roof concludes , about 43 percent are still unchurched  --  though most say they believe in some kind of God  --  and 24 percent are returnees to the institutional fold . <p> For keepers of the citadels of faith , it is these returning sheep  --  all 18 million  --  who offer the greatest challenge . The eldest , now in their 40s , are the easiest to understand . It turns out that the Forever Young generation did not escape the life cycle . Like their parents before them  --  verily , like generations before them  --  as people wed , aged , became fruitful and multiplied , they turned their attentions to matters of the spirit . One dropout , recalls the Rev. Alan Jones , dean of Grace Cathedral in San Francisco , figured it was time to come back when her 4-year-old pointed to a crucifix and asked , " What 's that man doing , Mom ? " Indeed , Roof 's study finds that couples with children are twice as likely to join a religious congregation than those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than childless spouses . Without a little child to lead them , most of the ' 60s generation would still be spending Sabbath mornings in bed . <p> No duty : The younger half of the cohort offers a different profile . They are much more likely than their older siblings to regard themselves as conservative and even " spiritual . " Their longing , however ill defined , is genuine , and now they 're seeking to satisfy it . They inspect congregations as if they were restaurants and leave if they find nothing to their taste . " Participation follows not out of duty or obligation usually , " Roof observes , " but if it fits their needs . " They do n't convert  --  they choose . <p> That message has not been lost on ambitious pastors yearning to " grow " a church . A group known as the Church Growth Movement ( CGM ) has sprung up , advocating an unsentimental , businesslike approach for clergy . " The marketplace is now the most widely used system of evaluation by younger churchgoers , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice that means polling , marketing and advertising . Evangelical Protestants , who have always been entrepreneurial , take those teachings as their own . " The No. 1 rule of church growth is that a church will never get bigger than its parking lot , " says the Rev. Gerald Mann , pastor of the 3,000member Riverbend Baptist Church in Austin , Texas . On Sundays , therefore , Mann employs a squad of off-duty police officers to direct traffic around the church 's 51-acre complex . <p> CGM experts judge a minister 's accountability not by his faithfulness to the Gospel but whether , as Schaller puts it , " the people keep coming and giving . " By that measure , the most successful churches are those that most resemble a suburban shopping mall . What works best , according to the CGM , is a one-stop church complex that offers an array of affinity groups where individuals can satisfy their need for intimacy yet identify with a large , successful enterprise . The ideal advocated by the CGM is the megachurch , total environment under a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a membership of 17,000 , tries to be all a megachurch can be . It supports 64 softball teams and 48 basketball teams and fields an additional 84 teams in volleyball soccer and flag football . There are also periodic golf tournaments and a year-round snack bar called Second Helping . The hub of this activity is the church 's Family Life Center , which is equipped with six bowling lanes , two basketball courts , an indoor jogging track , racquetball courts , weight and aerobics rooms , and separate areas for crafts and games  --  plus a music wing for its orchestra and 500-member choir . " Second Baptist is a place where I can go with my family to worship , where my wife can play and teach music and where I can play and coach basketball , " says Phil Elders . " It meets all my needs , both spiritual and physical . " Elders , 31 , is a former college player who joined the church in 1988 after going through bankruptcy . He recently ran Second Baptist 's conditioning programs for congregants , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball teams . <p> Texas , of course , is fertile Bible-belt country . But what 's a Baptist preacher with megadreams to do in California 's San Fernando Valley when his marketing surveys show that upscale congregants disdain the Baptist label ? Why , just drop the name . " People do n't like denominational tags anymore . All they want to know is , What 's in it for me ? " ' says the Rev. Jess Moody , pastor of what formerly was known as the First Baptist Church of Van Nuys . <p> When he took over in 1976 , Moody sensed trouble . The membership 's median age was 36  --  a danger sign , say Church Growth experts , that a congregation wo n't survive . " Our congregation looked like a cotton field , " Moody recalls . " We had so many white-haired folk sitting out there . " In 1986 Moody decided to build a new $6 million church in nearby Porter Ranch , and a survey of the upscale young families in the area helped him to find his way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going up in a former sheep pasture just off the busy Simi Valley Freeway and will be called , inclusively enough , Shepherd of the Hills . But Porter Ranch is horse country now , and Moody 's church , with its beamed ceilings , its stained-glass " hayloft " over the entrance , its huge stone fireplace and sizzler for serving breakfasts , will look like a divine dude ranch . John Myrick , 42 , and his wife find Moody 's church perfect for themselves and their five children . " There 's a spirit of putting people over doctrine and denominations , " says Myrick , an advertising executive . " The attitude is that they are for life , love and liberty  --  it 's more for things than against things . " <p> Moody has banished hellfire and damnation . And he 's dropped many of the standard terms of Christian theology . " If we use the words redemption or conversion , " Moody says , " they think we 're talking about bonds . " He still likes to wave a Bible when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his audience . The version he uses  --  and sells after services  --  is " Kwikscan , " which highlights the essential passages in boldface and requires no more than 30 half-hour sittings to read from Genesis to Revelation . " It 's a happy church , " says Paula Cracium , 31 , the daughter of a minister , who joined Moody 's congregation 12 years ago . " It totally accepts people as they are without any sort of don'ts and do 's . When our relatives visit , they all wish they had a church like ours . " <p> Not everyone can afford to build a new church to the latest specifications . But any congregation that wants to grow is learning to meet its customers ' needs . Roman Catholic churches are gearing up to satisfy the growing number of singles who are postponing marriage and parenthood and thus do not fit into the typical family-centered parish . The surprise is that many singles are responding favorably . At Atlanta 's Christ the King cathedral four years ago , 300 young college graduates responded to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now they are a parish unto themselves , complete with vacation trips , volunteer programs and special masses . There is even a small study group that looks into the foundations of the faith . " After you 've been out of college and done the bar scene , " says paralegal Sara Edstrom , 27 , " you reach a point where you say , ' There 's something more  --  what is it ? " ' <p> Lost sin : The rub comes when the subject turns to personal issues , especially sex . Networking with other young Catholics is fine , but priests have learned that returning singles still consider their private lives off-limits to confessors . They have a keen eye for the sins of society , " but as for individual sin , " observes Father Mark Gotwald , associate director of Milwaukee 's Young Adult Ministry , " it 's kind of lost . " <p> For most Jewish returnees , preparing their children for a bar or bat mitzvah ceremony seems to be the main reason for joining a synagogue  --  and for leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage . When asked why they are drop ping out after their last child 's 13th birthday , says Rabbi Edwin Farber of Temple Samu-El Or Olom in suburban Miami , " they give you a blank stare . They say , ' I joined , sent the kid to Hebrew school , but I 'm not religious ' . " What 's more , Miami-area rabbis are running into stiff competition from Jewish community centers , which provide a means of sustaining Jewish identity without the bother of religion . <p> The main problem , argues Brooklyn College sociologist Egon Mayer , is intermarriage . His extensive studies show that in the last 20 years , fewer than half of the Jews under 40 married another Jew .. " What are you going to go back to when the Jewish community has n't signaled its desire to have mixed religious couples in its midst ? " asks Mayer . " This is the most crucial question facing the community today . " <p> But there are returning Jews who take Judaism seriously and they are having their effect , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one tradition , " says Michael Strassfeld , coeditor of the popular Jewish Catalog series . " We 're saying , ' However you plug into this Judaism thing is fine ' . " There has been a modest revival of modern Orthodox Jews  --  congregations of successful , religiously committed Jews can be found from the Upstairs Minyan in Los Angeles to the Lincoln Square Synagogue in New York City . Reform temples find , often enough , that returnees want a strong dose of tradition , like davening in Hebrew . Some members of the Aquarian Minyan in Berkeley Calif. , are former Eastern religion enthusiasts whose gurus finally told them to explore the faith they left behind . What they discovered was Judaism 's own mystical tradition and a community in which they can meditate as well as observe inherited rituals . <p> For blacks , the question of religion is also a matter of roots . The last four decades have seen the rise of a black middle class which has entered the white professional world and its suburbs while retaining some of its ties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most blacks do n't want integration , " says Emily Tynes , 41 , a media strategist in Washington , D.C. One reason is politics : the black church speaks for the African-American community in ways that integrated churches can not . But even they are adapting to new demands  --  less hellfire in the sermons , more rap groups in the choir and plenty of day-care centers . " The changes in the black church have emerged not out of the pulpit , " says Lawrence N. Jones , dean of the Howard University Divinity School , " but out of the pews . " <p> Blessed witnesses : For earlier generations , the service was a stitch in time to hear the familiar word of God and to get right with the Lord . Those Sundays are long gone . " We 're a Biblically illiterate community , " acknowledges the Rev. Randall Updegraff Spleth , the 34-year-old pastor of booming Geist Disciples of Christ Church in Indiana . When Spleth uses parables from the Bible , he finds that " you constantly have to retell the story " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . Spleth makes sure " there is no time lag in his Sunday service " but has found a way to relate Gospel imperatives to an iconography his congregation readily relates to . In one recent homily , he contrasted the famous message of Christ 's Sermon on the Mount  --  " Blessed are the peacemakers "  --  with the RoboCops and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that today 's kids thrive on . His conclusion came with the force of a rude revelation : " We must raise our children to be witnesses to Christ in an R-rated world . " <p> What will become of those children is a humbling experience that young parents are only beginning to taste . After all , as children , they were led to church  --  and look how they turned out . " We want our children to make their spiritual choices in a context , not a vacuum , " says Sharon Kennedy , of Brooklyn , N.Y. , a lawyer and mother of three . She and her husband , Tom , joined the local Unitarian church , became active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're concerned that we 've given them a confused message , especially when they say they belong to a church that has no beliefs . But they 've learned to consider issues from a moral perspective . They 've learned about the importance of community . And they know there is more than one path to the truth . " <p> In sophisticated urban centers , the under-45 crowd tends to define itself as independent spiritual seekers and thus above the bonds of any one tradition . Among all those he has studied , Roof finds that 60 percent reject the notion that one should be limited to a single faith . Some religious folks have always shopped for churches , whether for doctrinal or social reasons . But until the postwar mobility took over , each denomination felt-and was-different . Methodists sang hymns like " Amazing Grace " and encouraged emotionalism in their services . Presbyterians prided them selves on scholarly sermons in the manner of John Calvin and , unlike the Baptists , did not talk about personal conversion . Lutherans and Episcopalians drank alcohol , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Unlike earlier religious revivals , the aim this time ( aside from born-again traditionalists of all faiths ) is support not salvation , help rather than holiness , a circle of spiritual equals rather than an authoritative church or guide . A group affirmation of self is at the top of the agenda , which is why some of the least demanding churches are now in greatest demand . <p> Wounded healers ' : In Chicago , the Unity Church attracts an average of 1,200 worshipers to its three free-form Sunday services . Each service includes a guided meditation to allow " the spirit " to affirm " unconditional acceptance of the self " " We are guiltless children of God , " says co-pastor Mike Matoin , " not a guilty child of the ego . " Like most churches these days , Unity is full of support groups , from Women Who Love Too Much to Overeaters Anonymous . " If it flies , we let it stay . We are all wounded healers , " says Matoin , who confesses to an addiction to Ho Hos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The quintessential boomer church may well be the Unitarian Universalist Association , which emphasizes , says UUA president William Schulz , " that each individual is the ultimate source of authority . " Never very large , the UUA now has 200,000 members and is enjoying its largest growth spurt in 20 years . Currently the Unitarians are running a three-city advertising campaign that captures perfectly the consumer ethos : " Instead of me fitting a religion I found a religion to fit me . " <p> It 's not easy making one size fit all . At Boston 's historic Arlington Street Church , long a seat of UUA radicalism , the Rev. Kim Crawford Harvie tries to invoke several traditions each December by celebrating the winter solstice , Chanukah , Kwanzaa and Christmas for Christians and others who are still awedby " the miracle of birth . " " At our best , we really try to celebrate diversity , " says Harvie , a lesbian and a single mother . But even she has been criticized for using the word humankind because it leaves out animals and plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roof discerns two disturbing tendencies . The first is that experts are hired to do the work because congregants have so little discretionary time . The second tendency is to create generational churches which ignore believers of other ages or classes whose needs and agendas do not match their own . <p> Theologically , the prospects are even blander . In their efforts to accommodate , many clergy have simply airbrushed sin out of their language . Like politicians , they can only recognize mistakes which congregants are urged to " put behind them . " Having substituted therapy for spiritual discernment , they appeal to a nurturing God who helps His ( or Her ) people cope . Heaven , by this creed , is never having to say no to yourself , and God is never having to say you 're sorry . <p> But as the generation ages , a deeper religious faith may take hold . Celebration of the self , after all , is a game young people play ; it is no way to deal with decline and death . Spiritual development takes time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer seem to encourage . Thank God for faiths that can help overcome addiction , loneliness or stress , for institutions that can help raise the children among us . But the quest for meaning and purpose does not end there . What the Lord requires of you , wrote the prophet Micah , is to do justice , love mercy and to walk humbly with your God . Those were never meant to be easy or ephemeral tasks . And they may be religion 's only true reward . As Jesus himself prayed to the Father before he died , " not my will , but thine , be done . " THE BOOMERS ARE BACK ! <p> At one time or another , roughly two thirds of baby boomers dropped out of organized religion . <p> But in recent years , more than one third of the dropouts have returned . <p> About 57%  --  43 million people  --  now attend church or synagogue . <p> More than 80% of the boomers consider them selves religious and believe in life after death . <p> The biggest group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The least likely to have returned are married couples without kids . Riverbend Baptist Church <p> Austin , Texas <p> Like any market-driven business , Riverbend Baptist Church surveys potential members with professional pollsters . They phone homes and ask if the residents go to church . If they say yes , the caller encourages them to continue . If they say no , the caller asks why and what kind of church might interest them . From these responses , the Rev. Gerald Mann has learned what to avoid : boring sermons , unfriendly people , too much talk about money and poor-quality child care . Says Mann , " Baby boomers have a mind-set of what a church is and we have to overcome their biases . " <p> Accordingly , visitors to the 3,000-member church can sample before they buy in , never get asked for money and always are sent away with at least a smile and a handshake .
