As the predominantly male audience watches transfixed , a scene shows two lusty sons of a rich landlord cornering a pretty , well-endowed maid in their plush bedroom . " Let me go , " she implores , but the men 's hands move toward her writhing body . The camera heightens the suggestion of what is to come without allowing the scene to become graphic ; there is no nudity , but there is plenty of screaming and leering .

Says he : " Because people live in a repressive society , they are sex starved . Filmmakers cash in on this .
