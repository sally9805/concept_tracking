<p> In the race for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors , there are 24 candidates , five open seats and a sense that much more than the roster of next year 's board is up for grabs . <p> This election marks the arrival of term limits in San Francisco politics . Under the new law , Supervisor Bill Maher can not seek re-election , leaving one open seat on the 11-member board . With only a few current board members holding to firm ideological positions  --  Supervisor Annemarie Conroy to the right , Supervisors Angela Alioto , Sue Bierman and Terence Hallinan on the left  --  no one is sure which way the election will shift the board 's moderate majority . <p> Two incumbents  --  Supervisors Conroy and Susan Leal  --  are viewed by some as vulnerable , although Conroy has fared well in some public polls . Both appointed to the board by Mayor Frank Jordan , Conroy and Leal are facing their first attempt at winning their seats in an election . <p> The other incumbents , Supervisors Carole Migden and Kevin Shelley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each is vying to be the top vote-getter in the election , a slot that brings the winner the board president 's seat and more power and prominence at City Hall . <p> Twenty challengers , many candidates of color , are trying to find room among the incumbents and edge one or two out of their seats . Six contenders are believed to have a serious shot : Sylvia Courtney , Tom Ammiano , Arthur Jackson , Mabel Teng , Alicia Wang and Bruce Quan . <p> The incumbents have greater name recognition and fund-raising power on their side , but as recent board elections have shown , none of them can necessarily count on getting his or her City Hall office back after November 8 . <p> * Annemarie Conroy has managed to stay a serious contender in a city where many of her most distinctive attributes would often be considered liabilities . <p> She is the lone Republican on the board in a heavily Democratic town . A Jordan appointee to the board and the mayor 's god- daughter , she has had a close working relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political embarrassments early on and has not gotten good marks in some public-opinion polls . <p> But the 30-year-old attorney has managed to benefit from what might seem to be political drawbacks . She has made the most of her access to the mayor 's office since starting on the board in April 1992 , working on issues such as cutting government spending and auditing various city departments . <p> Conroy pushed the city employee retirement system to hand over $ 30 million in overpayments in 1992 . Though then-Board of Supervisors President Kevin Shelley complained that Conroy unfairly took credit for a collaborative effort  --  a complaint others have echoed on different issues  --  many people credited Conroy for her savvy and tenacity and for ultimately delivering the deal . <p> Conroy has also ordered budget audits of the Water Department and the city 's compensatory time policy , which resulted in reports that identified potential savings of millions of dollars . <p> " I 've accomplished as much in two years as others have in four , " Conroy said . " The people who are supporting me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> * Susan Leal has worked to bring the efficiency of private business to City Hall , although she has sometimes found the worlds of business and politics do n't always work by the same rules . <p> A graduate of Boalt Hall School of Law , Leal , 45 , was an executive in a successful health- care organization before becoming a supervisor . When Jordan appointed her in June 1993 , Leal seemed like an ideal candidate to help expand the mayor 's appeal to Latino and gay voters . <p> But Jordan has presided over deep cuts in health spending and has had a rocky relationship with the city 's gay and lesbian community . On several hot-button topics , Leal has split with the mayor . <p> She opposed him on several key commission appointments , and she took a strong stand in favor of a 1993 resolution supporting the rights of immigrants , which Jordan vetoed but the board approved on an override . <p> Her record includes legislation ranging from a prohibition on compensatory time for city officials earning more than $ 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving General Assistance payments regardless of their immigration status . She also found money to keep open the Mission branch library , which houses the city 's biggest collections of Spanish books and audio tapes . <p> " We 've had our differences , " Leal said of her relationship with Jordan . " But I 've always been able to talk to him face to face and explain my positions . I 'm not a puppet , and I think he appreciates that . " <p> * Carole Migden is widely regarded as the front-runner to win the board presidency , which goes to the candidate with the highest number of votes . <p> Migden , 46 , swept into office four years ago as a pioneer  --  she was one of two lesbians elected to the board . Since then , her legislative agenda has become more conservative , from issues such as AIDS services and women 's health to capping wages for city employees . Her move toward the political center has won support from business groups and major corporations . Migden has raised more money than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' finance committee in 1993 , Migden worked with Jordan 's administration to plug a $ 184 million budget deficit . She also helped draft last year 's successful charter amendment that broke up the maligned city Public Utility Commission into separate transportation , water and power divisions . <p> This year , Migden co-authored a proposal that resulted in an agreement with unions to freeze public-employee wages for one year and to stop automatic pay raises . Her involvement in containing labor costs has not endeared her to unions . <p> Migden recently concluded a term as Democratic Central Committee chair , where she strengthened connections to state and national party leaders . She is considered smart , quick and a probable strong challenger to Jordan next year . But her high-gear personality and sometimes blunt manner has ruffled feathers at City Hall and even within the gay and lesbian community . <p> * Kevin Shelley , 38 , has been a leader on public-safety issues and proposals to open the process of government to the public . He authored the so-called " Sunshine Ordinance " this year that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wake of the shootings last year at 101 California Street , Shelley 's hearings on the city 's 911 emergency system resulted in a ballot measure to finance a $ 60 million emergency dispatch center . The measure had the support of Jordan and was approved by voters in June . <p> Shelley also authored tough gun control laws that ban the sale of weapons from homes and cars and prohibits the sale of exploding bullets . The legislation also requires gun dealers to obtain a city license . <p> But Shelley has been criticized for too often wriggling on issues . He tried to back out of support for an unpopular small-business tax last year . He continues to be a proponent of charter reform , but offered the motion this year that ultimately sank the latest reform attempt . <p> The son of labor organizer John Shelley , who was mayor from 1963 to 1967 , Shelley 's most loyal support comes from city unions . He resists the conservative notion of less government : " We all accept that government needs to downsize and economize , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people . Anarchies are n't there to allocate resources . "
