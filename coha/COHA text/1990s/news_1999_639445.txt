<p> Well , here we go . <p> We 're about to enter the year 2000 , and whether or not you think it 's the millennium , the end of civilization or just another loud party to be avoided , the next 12 months promise to be compelling for Colorado business . <p> As we do each year , The Denver Post convened a panel of experts to discuss what 's coming . What they said may surprise you . <p> That slight chill in the air , for example , is the cooling of the economy , especially outside the Denver metro area . And while technology seems to thrive limitlessly here , the cyber-boom may be bypassing too many of the area 's poor and minority populations . <p> A key to a better future clearly is education , to bridge the digital divide that separates haves from have-nots in technology . <p> Another important solution : better transportation , to get the people who need jobs to the locations where the jobs exist . <p> Other issues on the table : Did Denver Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal to sell the sports assets of Ascent Entertainment ? Will Colorado get too expensive to attract the best and brightest to its industries ? Finally , even nose rings and hoop dreams were discussed . <p> The panelists were : <p> Joseph R. Bell , executive director of the Bard Center for Entrepreneurship Development at the University of Colorado at Denver . <p> Virginia Butler , a partner in the Burks Butler public relations firm , and a community activist who serves on numerous boards and committees . <p> James Crowe , chief executive officer of Level 3 Communications Inc. , the information-carrier company that moved from Omaha to Broomfield last year . <p> David Solin , head of the Office of Economic Development , as well as international trade , for the administration of Gov . Bill Owens . <p> Moderating the session was Denver Post Business Editor Dan Meyers . <p> The same group will be featured a week from today offering broader predictions for the new year that will have just begun . <p> The Post : There are some signs of a cooling economy , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing and mining are flat or down already . Do you see this cooling coming and , if so , how are you dealing with it ? <p> David Solin : We see a slowing , not a real cooling . I would say that it 's a self-pacing mechanism , in fact , because we 've been going at such a quick pace the last eight years . So I think what we 're seeing is more normalizing in our growth . When you exclude the metro area , though , from the overall growth , there 's definitely a slowing . <p> When you exclude just the six-county metro Denver area from the state 's overall economic picture , there are some dramatic changes . Per-capita income drops 221/2 percent , unemployment increases by 43 percent . <p> And when you look at Colorado 's what I call the heritage industries , the mining , the agriculture and the travel and tourism , all are substantially lower than they 've been in the past . We 've diversified so well as a state . But if you 're looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . And certainly you can feel that if you 're in the outlying areas in the state . <p> Joe Bell : There continues to be a very strong entrepreneurial spirit , at least in the groups that I 've had an opportunity to work with . I know that there are a couple of studies going on in the state to create new business incubators . The incubators that are currently in the community are doing a great job , and they see a lot of activity . <p> More and more students are moving into the entrepreneurial environment . We 're seeing growth in the number of courses and diversity of courses that we 're offering . And I think that 's a strong indication of what their expectations of the future are , and direction that they want to go in . <p> We put about 500 ( students ) through the program in two and a half years . We 're going from three courses this semester to six next semester , and enrollment 's moving up quite nicely . <p> And one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent self-funded . The business community is very strongly behind the effort at the Bard Center , and we 'll continue to watch an increase in their level of commitment , not only in time but in dollars , which is the financial backbone . So I think that they 're betting that the future and the strength of our economy here in Colorado is entrepreneurship . <p> Gin Butler : The economy from a small-business standpoint is going well for us . We 're a small company . We 're the only African-American-owned advertising agency west of the Mississippi , I believe , until you get to one small firm in Dallas . And then you get to California . <p> I think the fact that we have been in business for 17 years , in a business where doors open and close daily , speaks for itself . And Susan Burkes , who 's my partner , and I are able to do economic development for people in our community because we have a strong policy that we hire women and people of color , and predominately people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will probably walk in and see a very multicultural staff . <p> Now when I get to my community-activist standpoint , I see a totally different story . And that is when everyone else is riding the crest of this wave , I look at communities such as Five Points , Globeville , Whittier , parts of Park Hill , where the unemployment is somewhere like - take a pick , whichever study you want to read - and that 's 12 to 20 percent unemployment . <p> So I get concerned about this economic boom that everyone 's talking about , and why that 's not affecting more people in Colorado . I 'm a business woman , and I 'm certainly enjoying it , but as a community activist , I keep going , ' What more can I do ? ' <p> Jim Crowe : The sector that we operate in , and the one , of course , that I 'm the most familiar with shows no signs at all , even remotely , of slowing down in any way . Our industry , information technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will continue to be in that mode for many years . <p> We 're limited like most of the companies in our business only by our ability to attract intellectual capital . All the financial capital is available that anyone would want . So I do n't see any kind of slowing , and do n't expect to see any kind of slowing anytime in the foreseeable future . <p> The Post : Colorado has lost a number of big firms , in terms of local ownership  --  TCI , MediaOne , KN Energy , and so forth . So does the loss of those firms rattle the economy , and does the future lie with smaller or larger firms ? <p> Butler : I do n't think that 's an either/or question . I think in order for us , as small business , to become more proficient and efficient , we 're going to rely on folks like Level 3 . For instance , just close to a year ago , and I 'm the partner that runs the business , it was a matter of : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more knowledgeable about information technology ? <p> And so what I did was become more knowledgeable about information technology . And had a whole new computer system put in the office . So I was able to grow my business based upon using the technology that folks like Jim provide . I 'm thinking that there 's a marriage here . I 'm a real proponent of partnerships . <p> Crowe : Just a comment first , so that you do n't think we 've gotten slow and bureaucratic quite yet . We were an idea two years ago . So hopefully we fit in the startup category . We just happened to have started out with a large plan , if you would , and a large set of ambitions , and we were fortunate that we got a lot of financing early on . <p> With that , I do n't think you can describe either large or small companies as exclusively attractive . We 're dealing with a business ecosystem , and you 've got to have a blend . There 's just no other way to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A good part of what we do , who we purchase from , who we work with , who we sell to , includes spectrum of companies from large to small . And any kind of economy of any size has got to have a mix of both . <p> With respect to your question about losing business in Denver to takeovers , mergers and acquisition activity , the real question is n't so much where the letter arrives , if it 's got ' corporate headquarters ' on the front . It 's where job activity occurs . I mean , I do n't see any immediate threat to TCI 's presence here , simply because they changed their name to AT &T.; I see a nice big building right around the corner from where I live , and it looks like we 'll be there for awhile . <p> So the real question is , where is the investment made ? Where are the jobs created ? And I 'm not at all certain ; in fact , I lean the other way in saying the activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good for the economy . It 's going to make folks more efficient , hopefully , create more jobs , more investment . <p> Bell : I was up in Boulder when Level 3 made the announcement that they were coming into town , and I looked at it as a tremendous boon for entrepreneurial activity . Everything from not only the suppliers but caterers , and everyone else . So they do walk very much hand in hand . We 're very lucky , because we have a wonderful mix of both some large and some small . And hopefully , some of the small have the same aspirations as Level 3 , to be that 2-year-old company that looks very much like that , and still saying we 're very entrepreneurial . <p> The Post : From the point of view of the governor 's office , is there a concern about the departure of the corporate flag ? Is that something that you think does have an effect on self-image , on perception from outside Colorado ? Does it matter ? <p> Solin : We 're always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's really not so much what address is listed on your corporate letterhead . It 's based upon the jobs you 're creating within that community . <p> There is also the corporate involvement in the community . Level 3 has been very involved in trying to help education systems in the state . They 've been very involved in the governor 's office , helping to advise the governor . I think that 's more important , if you have that type of involvement from your local businesses , than if they necessarily have the corporate location here . <p> The Post : Jim , you must have sized the place up . What were you told was important to do when you came here ? Was civic involvement one of the things that was made clear ? <p> Crowe : Top of the list was getting my edge sharpened on my skis . <p> Solin : You have your priorities in place . <p> Crowe : Then I got a bunch of audio tapes for the car , ' cause I knew I 'd be in there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location assessment . We had a lot of consultants who helped us through the process . We really had something of a unique situation . We had the financial resources to start out with a fairly large operation . But we had a blank sheet of paper . We did n't have any legacy or obligations to go anywhere , located in any particular position . This does n't happen a lot . Usually , there are some set of circumstances to push you one way or another . So we had a very detailed assessment . <p> But at the end of the day , the quantitative side can only tell you so much . And we had a team that visited the top half-dozen or so locations . Everybody in the room , and probably everybody that reads your newspaper , understands why we 'd want to choose Denver and Colorado . It 's the benefits , and the physical beauty , and the resources that are available here are unique . <p> In some ways , I think part of our biggest problem is the fact that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous position , that we tend to take it for granted , and I think we tend to compete a little less on the national basis than we should , for the kinds of things that will ensure we have the right kind of economy 15 years , 20 years from now . <p> When you kick the tires , you see so many good things here in Colorado . We may , if we 're not careful , not get more of our fair share of our intellectual capital that determines how Denver and Colorado are going to compete . <p> Butler : I have a concern about that , from a people of color standpoint . No. 1 , those that do have the intellectual capital and the intelligence , are certainly being - <p> Crowe : They can write their own ticket . <p> Butler : You bet . So that 's one issue . But what are we doing about those that are still in grade school and high school ? What would you tell me as a community activist ? <p> Crowe : We 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our country the information divide . Access to information . Those that have it and those that do n't . <p> Butler : What advice would you give me to help my community to do that ? How can I help ? What advice would you give me , not as an entrepreneur , but to say Level 3 is going to be looking for this , so Gin , if you 're going to be active in the community , here is the message you need to be taking . <p> Crowe : My view is that any individual of color or Caucasian , whatever the background , what they 're able to accomplish over time is determined by what they 're taught in a three- or four-year period from about 5 or 6 to 8 . You win it or lose it at that point . <p> Unfortunately , in my view the educational system in inner cities , in our country , is broken and needs to be fixed . It is n't that we do n't spend enough money . We spend about $ 6,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 percent more than the No. 2 country in the world . <p> But something happens between the time the money comes in the top and the time it gets to the student . And from my perspective , that 's the root cause . It needs to be fixed quickly and the biggest beneficiaries are those who go to school in the inner cities . <p> There 's no easy way . There 's no shortcuts . It 's got to start early and has to revolve around education . <p> Solin : I think that Gov . Owens is on the right step with the educational reform . One of the pieces in that educational reform package is to provide transportation funding so the child , in Colorado , can go to any public school you 'd like to . You do n't have to go to public school for a certain neighborhood . <p> We 're also focusing a lot on the information technology and training in K-through-12 . We start with children trying to have them expand their options , have them explore what different opportunities may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : And David , I would agree with that . All of this to me centers around our main topic , and that 's economic development and how to keep it solid in the state of Colorado . I keep telling people I 'm going to be drawing Social Security before very long , so I want all you folks working and paying Social Security , so I get my Social Security check . <p> How do we , in the state of Colorado community , get more involved from a state standpoint ? <p> Solin : The first step , Gin , I think in all honesty , is preparing to stop accepting the status quo education as sufficient . I think parents need to be more involved in watching what their children are learning in school , and not just be satisfied because the child comes home with an A on a report card , that the child is learning something . That A does n't mean what an A used to mean . <p> And the second step is , I think , this governor 's office is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specific type of educational change , this is a governor that loves to talk to you about it . <p> The Post : The media are not without responsibility here . The Post took a swipe at it with a series of stories last month on the digital divide . But as Jim said , we can all do more . <p> Let me shift gears . We just wrapped up - at least we think we wrapped up - a battle over who is going to own the sports teams of Ascent . My concern from an economic perspective is whether there was a message sent by the mayor that is troubling to anybody about the business climate in Denver , about the willingness of local government to insert itself into the business process . <p> Crowe : Anytime you talk about sports teams , you have to drop any illusion you 're talking about other kinds of businesses . I 'm not sure I 'd draw sweeping global conclusions when you 're talking about the local basketball team and hockey team . Anytime you buy , here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half million co-owners , and the mayor is certainly one of them . That does n't trouble me too much , nor do I draw too many conclusions from the mayor making a comment about something as visible as sporting teams . <p> The Post : Has the cost of living here , including but not limited to housing , started to affect the ability of the state to attract business ? And what are we doing about it ? <p> Solin : I do n't think the cost of living has necessarily risen to the level where it is in the Silicon Valley , or in ( Northern ) Virginia or New York . We 're still a very affordable market , but certainly we 've seen dramatic increases in the cost of living . <p> The question is not what is the cost of living , but what is the quality of life for that cost . And I think that Colorado still ranks very highly compared to those other locations . And I think that just like any other product , you can mark that product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the market is there for that product . <p> I 'm not proposing that we only have million-dollar homes in Colorado , let me make that clear . But people still get a very good value for the dollar , living in Colorado , and I think that as long as this is a market-driven economy in the United States , prices will fluctuate as people choose to live where they want to , and the demand increases . <p> The Post : Are n't businesses scrambling now for labor force ? <p> Solin : Well , that 's a national trend . That 's not just Colorado . Any good market in the country is having trouble finding the number of employees that they want . <p> Bell : I was at a national conference . It was truly a wonderful conference . And they had a number of very impressive speakers . A couple of senators , a couple of congressmen , two governors , the whole bit . The first speaker who got up talked about the labor shortage . And you 've got this diverse audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . And the first speaker talks about the labor shortage . <p> Where Jim 's had the frustration of finding the highly qualified IT , intellectual-background type , small businesses are struggling just to find qualified individuals with high school degrees , a certain level of computer proficiency , a certain degree of proficiency in regard to interpersonal skills . <p> I live in a neighborhood that 's very much a multicultural neighborhood . I sit on my porch and I talk to the kids going by , the six-year olds to the fourteen-year-olds . I say , ' What do you want to do ? What are you going to be ? How 's school going ? ' And they all want to be basketball players . <p> Nobody wants to be Bill Gates . So maybe sometimes we put the wrong emphasis on the correct role model out there . And maybe Bill Gates is n't the right one . I think Jim would be an excellent one . <p> Crowe : I 'd trade bank accounts with him , though . <p> The Post : Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a problem , next year , the decade to come ? <p> Bell : Yes . And I think Colorado is going to face that difficulty , because we are seeing an appreciation of cost of living here at a very significant rate . <p> We 're creating a number of high-paying jobs . But I think we 're losing some of that infrastructure that supports some of those high-paying jobs . And Colorado is going to have a struggle in that area , I think . <p> The Post : What do we do about it ? <p> Solin : I think the root probably lies in the educational process . I think it lies in some aggressive things that are being done in state government right now , that I think will make a difference , but I think there is a lag that we 're going to have to work on . <p> Butler : Cost of living . From a small-company standpoint , it 's certainly affecting companies like mine . The salaries that people are demanding are unbelievable . I was trying to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone , and greet clients as they come in the door . They were demanding $ 15 an hour . <p> And they talk about the cost of parking , cost of lunch downtown , and those kinds of things . And it 's affecting small businesses like ours . <p> One of the issues that I 'm finding : I also sit on the board of Curtis Park Community Center . And we have probably one of those most successful welfare work programs in the state . And so teaching them the technical skills and placing them in jobs has not been difficult . Where the difficulty comes in is life skills . We 're taking individuals that perhaps are third- and fourth-generation welfare . To them , the concept of an alarm going off , and I 'm expected to be at work at 8 o'clock , is not there . That is sad . <p> The things that I deal with over there is : take the rings out of the eyebrows , the nose , the lips , the four in the ear , and the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you 're trying to change me . ' ' No , but I 'm trying to tell ya ' you got to make a choice . ' <p> The Post : As a business owner/operator , how do you try to overcome that problem ? <p> Butler : I do n't hire them . Sorry , but I do n't hire them , because as a public relations firm , as a marketing advertising firm , you are judged by that first person that they meet when they walk in the door . I do n't care what 's going on in the back room , but my first impression of The Denver Post this morning was an elevator that did n't work . No , it really was n't bad , Dan . But we tend to do those kinds of things . <p> But I 've got to ask the question : how many of you in this room would hire a receptionist , the first person you see , that has four earrings in her ear , and one 's a diaper pin , or nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Crowe : Does she have a degree in computer science ? If she does n't , tell her to get one , then she can appear however she wants to . If we had any rules about body piercing , we 'd lose 25 percent of our work force . <p> Butler : Would you really ? Now , see that 's good for me to hear . <p> The Post : With Level 3 , you folks clearly made a calculation that there was work force to be had here . How , going forward , do you keep those folks coming in ? Were you serious about the 25 percent nose rings ? <p> Crowe : Well , that 's not a scientific sample but let 's just say that if you have the right skill set these days , you get to make the rules . <p> You know , if we were to do a check on people 's views of the desirability of various metropolitan areas , I doubt you 'd find those with the lowest cost of living and the cheapest housing as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your point , David , and simply say if areas invest wisely , they can develop very attractive areas , and I think Denver 's done a reasonable job in that regard . I think a good key to it is to continue to plan , or maybe be more aggressive in planning . If you do n't guide growth , you 're going to end up with some unintended consequences , and I think we have some of those here in this area . In terms of the housing , you can ask the question , ' Relative to what ? What am I competing for ? With whom do I compare ? ' In that regard , we 're competitive . <p> Solin : When you look at the state overall , the state 's cost of living , it 's substantially higher , again , in the six-county area than the rest of the state . If you as an employer are looking to come into Colorado , and hire an $ 8- to $ 10-an-hour workforce , and you called our office and said , ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or move into Boulder County , ' I 'd tell you it 's a terrible business decision for you to do it . <p> There are tremendous markets in the state for you to draw people from , where they can still afford to buy a house on that $ 10-an-hour salary . <p> That 's where we 're trying to help highlight some of the other areas in the state where you can still afford the workforce and the housing . But as we shift to the intellectual-capital employees , those salaries are substantially higher . <p> This is a market-based problem . It really is not a problem that state government as a whole can do much to solve . We can address the preplanning , such as the traffic . We can address the K-through-12 system , and try to continue to grow our own good employees . But ultimately the cost of goods is something dictated by the market and not by the government . <p> The Post : And it 's fair to say that Gov . Owens , even before he took office , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be interesting to see in three or four years what 's really happened with that . <p> Butler : We can all joke about being stuck on I-25 . But I think there 's another component here , and that 's transportation . And that 's RTD . <p> That seems to be another barrier for those communities that really need the jobs , and they would be willing to take the entry-level jobs to perhaps be able to be grown and developed and sponsored at a Level 3 or an AT &T,; but just ca n't get there . And until they 're in those jobs that are making that kind of money , they ca n't afford to go out and buy their own transportation to do that . <p> Solin : You know , if you look around this table , there 's five people and none of them are actually from Colorado . And yet we 're talking about Colorado 's future . And I think that 's actually one of the reasons that Colorado is such a strong state . We all left locations where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now building a state , in effect .
