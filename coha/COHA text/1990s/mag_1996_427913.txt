When I woke up , El Regiomontano , an express train en route from Monterrey to Mexico City , was chugging up a hill outside of San Luis Potosi . Opening the window shade of my Pullman berth , I squinted out at the blindingly sunny morning . In the sudden brightness , the scene outside my window burned itself into my memory like a snapshot . A farmer dressed in white stared at the train . Behind him a terraced plantation of tree-high prickly pear cactuses climbed the hillside in neat rows , their bright green pads and fat purple fruits glowing in the slanting rays of the early sunshine . The snapshot image came back to me as I wandered around Mexico City 's sprawling Mercado Merced looking at the produce a few days later . Standing beside a perfectly stacked column of cactus pads that must have weighed several hundred pounds , a woman wearing rubber gloves was patiently scraping the pads one by one with a potato peeler . Cactus pads are properly known as cladodes , but they are better known on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are eaten as a vegetable sauteed with onions , garlic , or cheese . But before they can be sliced and cooked , they must be scraped clean of tiny spines , called glochids , that grow in clusters and are barbed on the end . At a market stall nearby , I bought a purple cactus pear that was slit open for easy eating and trimmed of spines . The fruits , called tunas in Mexico , taste somewhat like honeydew melon . As I ate the tuna , I discovered that the fruit has a lot of seeds . My efforts to discreetly spit them out into a piece of paper caused howls of laughter among the prickly pear sellers . An amused tuna salesman finally demonstrated in a gulping pantomime that you are n't supposed to spit the seeds out , you are supposed to swallow them . The seeds are n't small , and I did n't have much luck chewing them , so I ended up swallowing them whole , like a mouth of pills . From their studies of mummified human feces , archeologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least nine thousand years . The Amerindians of Mexico and the American Southwest ate the fruits of at least fourteen different kinds of cactuses . In Mexico , the fruits and flowers ofwild cactuses , such as the strawberry cactus ( Echinocereus stramineus ) , are still harvested when they are in season . The flowers of some wild species are considered delicacies . But most of the cactuses eaten in Mexico are cultivated on plantations like the one I saw from my train window or in backyard gardens . In Mexico , some pitahaya cactuses , such as the Stenocereus , are grown for their fruit . But it is the Opuntia ficus-indica , better known as the prickly pear , that has become Mexico 's main food cactus . On my way home to Austin , the image of the farmer in his cactus field came to me again as I drove across the vast expanse of south Texas , a region where prickly pears grow in abundance . I had eaten nopalito tacos in Tex-Mex restaurants before , and I 'd seen prickly pear fruit in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . Was there such a thing ? Or did we actually import all our prickly pear products from Mexico , even though there were prickly pears all around us ? I made a few phone calls when I got home to see if I could find anybody who was up on the cactus business . Friends in the produce industry gave me the name of Jay McCarthy , a chef in San Antonio . I was told McCarthy was doing some interesting new things with tunas and nopalito and that he was working on a cactus cookbook . People were starting to call him the Cactus King . So late in the summer , I went to visit Jay McCarthy . The lanky , curly-haired chef told me the story with some amusement . The whole thing started when he bought some five-gallon glass jars to decorate a restaurant on San Antonio 's River Walk , where he once worked . McCarthy grew up on the island of Jamaica , where bars and restaurants often displayed big glass jars of rum-soaked fruit , which they used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in this Southwestern restaurant , substituting tequila for the rum . And what better fruit to soak in tequila than the prickly pear ? So McCarthy ordered a couple of cases of tunas . Within a few days of filling the jars , he found that the purple cactus pears had stained the tequila a deep scarlet tint , which looked great in the sunny bar . And when the time came to make cocktails , McCarthy was delighted by the blood red color and tart flavor he got when he blended the tuna-flavored tequila with the pureed , strained fruit pulp . McCarthy called the frozen prickly pear margaritas " cactus ritas " and put them on the menu . The drink quickly became the talk of the town , and before long , the restaurant was selling as many as 1,500 cactus ritas a week . But that meant McCarthy needed to find fifty fifteen-pound cases of prickly pears every week . During the July through September Mexican harvest season , this was easy enough  --  a case sells for twelve to fifteen dollars at that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can find one  --  runs as high as sixty dollars . McCarthy was desperate for cactus fruit , so he started asking around to see if there was an alternative source . That was how he learned about Peter Felker , of Texas A &M; University in Kingsville , Texas . Seeking to turn prickly pear cactus into a cash crop , Felker was assisting Texas farmers who were experimenting with a new , nearly spineless variey developed by Texas A &M; for the nopalito market . Felker hosts a yearly symposium for people interested in cactus agriculture . McCarthy informed me that the next seminar was just a few weeks away and suggested that if I wanted to find out more about cactus cultivation , I ought to attend . So on the appointed date , I drove down to Kingsville and sat in on the proceedings . There I met cactus experts from Israel , Mexico , and South America . I learned that although the prickly pear is a food source in semiarid countries all over the world , much of the scientific research in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Felker 's cactus seminar attempts to bring farmers , ranchers , scientists , and food professionals together to consider the prickly pear as an agricultural product instead of a nuisance . " I just planted ten acres of nopalito cactus , " laughed Robert Mick , a farmer from Sinton , outside of Corpus Christi . " Eighty years ago , my grandfather spent his days clearing our land of prickly pear . Now I 'm planting the stuff . " But this crop does not require prime farmland ; much of its appeal for farmers is that it will grow in marginal areas where other crops have failed . Even poor , rocky soil can yield as much as 18,000 pounds of fruit per acre . " I see it as an enormous opportunity , " Felker told me . " After all , prickly pear grows naturally on seventy million acres in Texas . We are already studying dozens of fruit-producing varieties , trying to find those that can withstand our winters . " During the symposium , Felker and Eulogio Pimienta ( an expert on cactus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Guadalajara , Mexico ) , examined specimens in the Texas A &M; test plots while I tagged along . They were carving up cactus pads looking for the causes of arious diseases : " How long have cactuses been cultivated in Mexico ? I asked Pimienta . " Roughly sixty centuries , according to the anthropologists ' estimates , " Felker translated . As they worked , I noticed that they were getting lots of spines stuck in their fingers . " How many of those do you get stuck with every year ? I asked . " Too many to count , " said Felker . " And if there 's one thing to educate the public about , it 's how to get them out . Use a pair of tweezers Your first inclination when you ca n't get hold of them with your fingers is to try to pull them out with your teeth . If you do that , odds are you will end up with one stuck for a fruit-bearing prickly pear that can withstand temperatures as low as 10deg Fahrenheit . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so many different varieties of prickly pear fruit in Mexico to experiment with . White tunas , yellow tunas , purple tunas , pink tunas , and green tunas are all popular varieties . By taking cuttings from many types , Felker has gathered the world 's largest collection of useful genetic sources for the cactus pear . After the symposium ended , the town of Kingsville sponsored a cactus cook-off , which demonstrated the plant 's culinary versatility . I was asked into service to help with the judging . While there were a few awful combinations , such as nopalitos with canned fried onions and canned cream of mushroom soup , most of the dishes we tasted were very good . A cold nopalito salad with oranges and jicama was the best of the show . Other standouts included a nopalito pie , which tasted like a tart apple pie , and a hot shrimp-nopalito casserole served in tomato sauce . The nopalitos looked and tasted a little like green beans , but with a pleasantly tart aftertaste . I had hoped someone would submit a tuna casserole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picnic tables in the public park eating our cactus dishes , I finally got an answer to my questions about cactus plantations in the United States . As it turns out , the spineless and fruitless variety of prickly pear grown for nopalitos is not the only cactus farmed in this country . Prickly pear fruit orchards , like the one I had seen from my train window , also exist in the United States . I was surprised by this news , but even more amazed by the story of how prickly pears got here . " Most people in the Southwest think that everybody who eats prickly pear fruit is Hispanic , " said Jim Manassero , the executive vice president of D'Arrigo Bros . Company of California . " Not so . Italians have been growing it since the sixteenth century . Sailors brought the plant back from the New World . In Italy , the fruits are known as fichi d'India , or Indian figs , and they are extremely popular in Sicily . " D'Arrigo Bros . Produce Company was founded in the early 1900s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a pushcart in Italian neighborhoods . The business thrived , and in the 1950s one of the brothers went to California to buy farmland where the company could grow agricultural products such as broccoli and prickly pear fruit , which were in high demand among their Italian customers , but were not being grown by American farmers of the era . With a 270-day growing season , the California fields now turn out about three million pounds of cactus fruit a year , sold primarily in the Italian American neighborhoods of New York , Boston , and Toronto . Demand for the fruit is high these days and is steadily growing . What 's more , in the wake of the Southwestern cuisine movement , the fruit has begun to break out of its ethnic niche . Now that innovative chefs have shown us how to make cactus fruit margaritas , salsas , jellies , and sorbets , people want to try these recipes at home . One large regional juice company , Knudson , now markets " lime-cactus quencher , " made with a yellow tuna , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Karen Caplan , a distributor of specialty produce in Los Angeles , thinks that prickly pear could follow kiwi as the nation 's next fruit fad . But first , she suggests a name change . To make the fruit sound more appealing to U. S. consumers , Caplan suggests that prickly pears , or tunas , should be called " cactus pears . " Unfortunately , the marketing expert had no advice on what to do with the seeds . Culinary adventurer Robb Walsh writes about food for the Austin Chronicle . <p>
