The royal farce continues . Last week the Queen of England 's corgis , gathered at London 's Heathrow Airport to welcome her home after a glum royal tour of Canada , passed the time by terrorizing a German shepherd employed by the police . The cop dog was rescued . Meanwhile , the ravening tabloids were already squaring off for the November confrontation between two royal tell-all books : Jonathan Dimbleby 's on Prince Charles , based on his recent TV program ; and the sequel by Andrew Morton to his 1992 super-best seller on the Princess of Wales , called Diana : Her New Life . <P> But the juiciest news last week appeared in the tabloid News of the World , which claimed Diana had made some 300 hang-up calls to a well-connected London art dealer , Oliver Hoare , 48 . Hoare feared the calls were the work of terrorists who knew his business is in Middle Eastern art . But according to the tabloid , a police investigation showed they were made from phones in Kensington Palace , where Diana lives , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone and from the home of her sister , Lady Sarah McCorquodale . <P> Just as with the Squidgy tapes and Camillagate  --  already part of the language  --  the Waleses were undone by the telephone . To deny the charges , mysteriously leaked to the paper , Diana took the unusual step of contacting a rival royals reporter , the Daily Mail 's handsome Richard Kay . Well , she almost denied them . Kay reported she had been in phone contact with the dashing Hoare at the time the calls began in September 1992 , just before the Waleses separated . Hoare was an old friend of the couple and , hoping to save the marriage , tried to negotiate between them . When Hoare 's wife answered , Kay wrote , Diana may have replaced the receiver  --  but 300 times ? Diana said she was not a nuisance caller and produced her diary , which shows that she was sometimes out on appointments when she was supposedly at home conducting phone war . <P> " I do n't even know how to use a parking meter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting quite shrewdly that " whoever is trying to destroy me is inevitably damaging the institution of the monarchy . " Diana is in an increasingly vulnerable position . Since her separation from Charles in December 1992 , she has searched for a private life . The media frenzy has continued unabated , however , and last December she announced her semiretirement from public activities . None of it has made much difference . She is still the most photographed woman in the world . <P> Diana , who has a strong will but a fragile temperament , may really have buckled under the strains that followed her decision to leave her old , privileged life as Charles ' rejected wife . No new life is open to her , and any attempts to get to know another man would be met with a furor . Observers of the British Establishment  --  a powerful force comprising senior Conservative politicians , civil servants , heads of financial institutions , certain members of the intelligentsia and the aristocracy  --  have noted how it is closing ranks behind Charles . In ' 92 Diana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfish , a spendthrift and maybe crazy .
