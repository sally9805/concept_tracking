Section : THE OBJECT AT HAND CRAYOLA CRAYONS TAKE US ALL BACK WITH THEIR FONDLY REMEMBERED LOOK , SCENT AND FEEL ON PAPER <p> BOTHER , NO PEN . DEEP AT THE BOTTOM OF my purse , I snag a purple crayon . Hey , I 'm a mom , and I scrawl big waxy letters on the back of an envelope . Thank heaven for the ubiquitous crayon . <p> The object at hand is one of only a few known to exist . It is an original box of 64 Crayola crayons from 1958 . It 's the rare baby boomer who does n't remember one like it  --  the first box with the built-in sharpener . It was given to the National Museum of American History ( NMAH ) last year at a celebration in Manhattan 's Rainbow Room to honor the 40th anniversary of the package . Bob Keeshan  --  Captain Kangaroo  --  was there , and press accounts appeared for days . Reporters waxed nostalgic over the box with its classic green and yellow chevrons . <p> " Can a brand-new crayon color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New York Times headline . We boomers : like everything else , we think we own the crayon . But the truth is , nearly everybody alive today probably made their first colorful squiggles with a Binney &; Smith Crayola . <p> It was 1903 when the crayon made its debut . Before that a child 's crayon was just a stick of colored clay or chalk . It looked nice but when put to paper , nothing much happened  --  not a pretty picture . Binney &; Smith was a small , 21-year-old firm , owned by Edwin Binney and C. Harold Smith . They were already in the business of making color . They owned the rights to a line of red oxides of iron for the red paint used by most farmers on their barns . And they were also sellers of tamp black and white chalk . <p> They had been among the first to solve the centuries-old problem of how to manufacture a really black black . The answer was expensive carbon black . Binney &; Smith likes to credit itself for figuring out how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the company won a gold medal for its carbon black display . <p> In 1902 , they cleared the dust from America 's classrooms with the invention of the then-famous An-Du-Septic Dustless Blackboard Chalk . The new chalk won Binney &; Smith another gold medal , at the 1904 St. Louis World 's Fair . <p> By this time , they were doing a brisk business selling their products in America 's classrooms . Besides chalk , they made slate pencils . But schools could n't afford artist 's crayons . The Easton , Pennsylvania , plant was already making an inexpensive industrial marking crayon out of carbon black and a durable paraffin . <p> Well , the rest is history . Color came to the classroom . It was Alice Binney , a former schoolteacher , who came up with the name Crayola . She combined the French word craie , meaning " chalk " with " ola , " derived from " oleaginous , " or " oily . " <p> One of the first customers was the United States government , which began shipping crayons to schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigments and the wax , as well as how they give the crayons their distinctive smell , is a closely guarded secret . But some basics are clear . <p> Pigments , produced from natural sources  --  slate yields gray ; metals , such as iron , yield reds ; various types of earth yield yellows and browns  --  start off as powders that are pounded , ground , sieved , then refined and heated . The temperature determines the shade of color . Since 1903 , more than 600 shades of Crayola crayons have been produced . <p> In June 1990 Binney &; Smith decided to retire eight of its old colors to make some of the more modern , brighter colors that children seemed to be searching for in their artistic palettes . Not so fast , said a few of Crayola 's veteran fans . One morning , a few weeks later , Binney &; Smith executives arrived at their headquarters to find picketers protesting the decision . The RUMPs , or Raw Umber and Maise Preservation Society , and the CRAYONS , or Committee to Reestablish All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the old colors were rereleased later that year in a special holiday commemorative collection , the groups were mollified . Not too long ago , " indian red " became the third Crayola color ever to be renamed , when Binney &; Smith decided that even though the name referred to the pigment from India , sensitivity required a new name . The new name , " chestnut , " selected by Crayola customers , seems rather dull when you compare it with the names that came in as close seconds  --  " baseball-mitt brown " and " the crayon formerly known as indian red . " In 1958 " Prussian blue " was renamed " midnight blue , " since most children had never heard of Prussia . And in 1962 , " flesh " was renamed " peach . " <p> Back at the National Museum of American History , a large storage-room drawer reveals the museum 's extensive crayon collection , ranging from the very old to some of the more recent , even including fruit-scented versions . There 's a box , dated 1912 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor sketching , " it says on the side , reflecting Impressionism 's emerging popularity . Binney &; Smith first marketed in two directions : to artists and to schoolchildren . Here 's the schoolroom version : " Good in any climate , certified non-toxic . " Here is a beautiful round wooden container that looks like a toothpick holder , full of crayons . And here is a beautifully crafted wooden box , its dovetail construction giving it the look of a treasure chest . The curator says that it is a treasure . It 's filled with the 1941-57 factory standards  --  the master crayons , if you will . And there next to the standards is a box of today 's " Multicultural My World Colors Crayons . " The smell of paraffin bombards me . The olfactory system engages . The hypothalamus clicks on . Look out ! Here they come-childhood memories ! <p> That familiar smell  --  a Yale University study on scent recognition once ranked crayons as number 18 of the 20 most recognizable scents to American adults . When I visit Binney &; Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that smell is making me feel like I 'm 8 years old again . The plant is running full tilt to produce for the back-to-school season . Three billion crayons are made here each year . Wooden pallets , each piled with cases of crayons waiting to be packaged , line the walls . Outside the factory is a row of two-story storage tanks holding liquid paraffin , which will be pumped into vats and mixed with colored powdery pigment . <p> Crayon molder Michael Hunt , from Bangor , Pennsylvania , is showing me how it 's been done since the very early days . Besides the paraffin and the pigment , Hunt tells me , the crayon also contains talc . " It 's like the flour in a cake mix , gives it texture . " His leather workman 's boots are mottled with orange wax . Both of us are wearing protective goggles because the wax that he is pumping from his vat into a 40-pound pail is at 240 degrees Fahrenheit . " Sometimes a little of it splashes onto my face , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cools off pretty quickly . " He deftly lifts the bucket out from under the vat and spills the wax out across the cooling table , a gentle wave rolling across the top as the wax settles into the molds  --  74 rows of eight . We 're making the giant " My First Crayons " that fit easily into the hands of preschoolers . <p> We wait the 7 1/2 minutes for the wax to cool . When a timer chimes , Hunt announces the crayons are ready . He runs a cutting device over the top of the molding table and shaves away the extra wax . Then he lays the collecting tray carefully over the top , lining up the holes he touches a button , activating a press from below , and the crayons gently rise up into the collecting tray . With ease , Hunt hoists the 3 1/2-foot-long tray of crayons around to the sorting table behind him and dumps the crayons there . On inspection , he pulls a couple of pointless runts from the rows and , with a wooden paddle , starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole old-fashioned process takes about 15 minutes . <p> Not too far away , a more modern , continuous-production operation is under way as a rotary molding table does all of Hunt 's handwork mechanically . The machine is making the standard-size crayons . Materials go in one end , and operator Elizabeth Kimminour receives dozens of the thin , paper-wrapped products at the other end . She lays them neatly into cartons to be sent to the packaging plant . <p> And that 's where I get a glimpse of the celebrated box of 64 being produced . Clicking and whirring , factory machines are endlessly fascinating for those of us who rarely see them in action . Grabbers mysteriously turn flat sheets of printed cardboard into boxes while plastic sharpeners , lined up like soldiers on parade , drop precisely onto a wheel that injects them into passing boxes , which somehow along the way end up with crayons in them . <p> Binney &; Smith is owned today by Hallmark Cards . And that company closely guards the Crayola trademark . ( Ms. Crayola Walker of Bellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County , Virginia , however , were graciously allowed to " borrow " the name . ) Many companies , particularly foreign ones , would like to capitalize on the Crayola fame , and copycatters try to steal all the time . In the NMAH collection , there 's an example of one such attempt  --  a party bag made to look very Crayola , but it is n't . Licensing of the trademark is common , however , with products ranging from software videos , sheets and bedding , to backpacks , wallpaper and wall paints , and even shoes that look like a box of crayons . <p> Back home again with my kids and a neighbor 's child , I announce that we are going to color . I pull three boxes of 64 from a bag and hand one to each child . In no time at all , their industrious minds  --  their entire bodies  --  are completely engrossed in their work . <p> I remember reading in the Binney &; Smith literature a claim that as a youngster , Grant Wood , who later painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early 1900s and won . The sunlight pours in through the window , translating color to vision . Claire is making a rainbow . She picks up a crayon . " This is ' thistle . ' It 's what Eeyore eats . " Next she chooses " dandelion , " " forest green , " " sky blue wisteria " and " tickle me pink . " Patsy is drawing a portrait of Jessie , and Jessie is drawing the flower vase on the teacart . I try to imagine the inner workings of their creativity . Optical images register on the tiny retinas at the backs of their eyes , electronic signals travel the optic nerves to their brains , the signals are interpreted and messages sent back . Suddenly I snap out of my reverie as Jessie , pondering the red crayon in her hand , says , " I wonder who decided red should be ' red , ' anyway ? " And then she thinks a minute and says , " Do you think it was George Washington ?
