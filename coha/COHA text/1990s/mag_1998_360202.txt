Bigger was n't only better during the 1950s and ' 60s , bigger was best . The Cadillac Coupe de Ville was as long as a city block , with tail fins extending to the suburbs . Elvis had big hair , the Beatles came along with even bigger hair , and the Jackson Five arrived with stupendously massive hair . <P> It was only natural that American business , seduced by the same belief that size matters , would reshape the corporation into the gargantuan mass called the conglomerate . <P> The men who built the conglomerates were vastly different from the reigning generation of bosses . They were classic outsiders  --  non-Eastern , non-American , non-Wasp and non-Ivy . Rebels such as James Ling , founder of Ling-Temco-Vought , Charles Bluhdorn of Gulf &; Western Industries ( satirized as Engulf &; Devour ) and Harold Geneen of International Telephone and Telegraph stormed America 's corporate towers even as students and protesters were laying siege to the nation 's ivory towers . <P> Theoretically , a conglomerate made sense because it could balance out the business cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somewhat perversely , both the tax code and the antitrust policy at that time encouraged the strategy . ITT bought the maker of Wonder bread . <P> Astute risk takers and charismatic salesmen like Ling , Bluhdorn and Geneen were among the first to see the opportunities . The bull market that began in 1962 was kinder to some companies than to others , leaving many quality firms relatively undervalued and thus takeover targets . " We had a lot of different sources of financing , " says Ling , 75 , of LTV , in its heyday the 14th largest company in the U.S. " But we usually swapped our companies ' stock for that of the firms we were buying . " <P> The frenzied stock exchanges drove the price of diversified firms higher than that of the separated parts  --  the opposite of what happens today .

" <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built it into Gulf &; Western Industries , a $2 billion marvel whose activities ranged from mining ( New Jersey Zinc ) to movies ( Paramount Studios ) . By 1969 , the former $15-a-week clerk was worth $50 million . <P> Ling , an Oklahoma high school dropout , went into the electronics business in 1946 with a $3,000 stake . To finance his earliest acquisitions , he hired salesmen to peddle shares of Ling Electric Co. door to door in Dallas and even set up a booth at the Texas State Fair . Brokers laughed , but investors did well . " The genesis of our business was diversification , " says Ling of his rapid expansion , which included everything from aircraft to baseball mitts . <P> No one bought more companies than ITT 's Geneen , who during the second half of the 1960s was called " the greatest businessman alive . " ITT made telephone equipment , ran hotels , built homes , rented autos , sold insurance , made grass seed and rented billboards . He believed in big and swore that " if risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to enjoy the ride . "
