New evidence explains how DNA conducts charge <p> Look at a long , thin piece of DNA and it 's not hard to think of it as a wire . Look more closely at its atomic structure and it 's even easier to think of DNA that way . <p> Two single strands twirl together into a double helix-a twisted ladder with rungs formed by pairs of complementary molecular bases . Electron orbits within the base pairs extend above and below each rung of the ladder , overlapping with their counterparts from neighboring rungs and creating a continuous pathway through the molecule . <p> Other polymers with similar systems , known as pi-stacks from the name of the orbitals that overlap , conduct electricity easily . For many years , researchers wondered , Could DNA do the same ? <p> Some provocative experiments done several years ago by Jacqueline K. Barton of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and her colleagues indicated that the answer is yes . Their results suggested that electrons move through DNA with amazing ease over long distances . In effect , DNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Many other researchers , however , were not so sure . Their own experiments suggested that electrons did n't travel through DNA with such impunity . The electrons took a slower pathway instead of a fast " pi-way " through the center of the DNA molecule , they believed . Barton 's experiments ignited a controversy that has endured to this day . <p> New evidence , however , may bring researchers closer to resolving this contentious debate . As scientists delve into the details of DNA 's electrical properties , they 've found the picture to be much more complicated than they originally thought . Researchers once on opposite ends of the spectrum of opinions are fitting the disparate results into a common framework . The question no longer is whether DNA can conduct , but how well and under what circumstances . <p> By understanding how charge moves within DNA , researchers hope to learn how radiation causes genetic damage and maybe even how DNA repairs itself . <p> About a decade ago , while at Columbia University , Barton and her colleague Nicholas J. Turro designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zip through DNA 's pi-stack . They chose two molecules that slipped in , or intercalated , between the rungs of the ladder . <p> First , they slipped an electron-donating ruthenium complex into the DNA helix . When the researchers shone light on it , the ruthenium complex glowed . Next , they added an electron-accepting rhodium complex , and the glow disappeared . <p> To come up with an explanation for these findings , Barton and her colleagues assumed electrons could travel within the pi-stack . Shining light on the DNA excites an electron in the ruthenium complex to a higher energy state ; when that electron falls back to its original state , the excess energy comes out in the form of a photon of light . <p> When the DNA also contains a rhodium complex , however , the excited electron moves to that complex , and no light emerges . <p> Other scientists expressed skepticism at the findings . Although some synthetic organic polymers do conduct electricity , biological molecules , such as proteins , had not shown such evidence of conductance . " To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The outside world did n't have any theory for this , " Turro adds . <p> Barton admits that the critics had a point . Her studies depended on a negative observation-the quenching of luminescence . That left open the possibility that the electron-accepting molecules might be clustering around the electron-donating complexes , thus short-circuiting the glow . <p> To address these concerns , the researchers tethered an electron-donor molecule to one end of a short strand of DNA . They found that the tethered molecule luminesced . When they also attached an acceptor molecule to the other end , the luminescence vanished . In these experiments , they felt certain that the intercalators would stay a fixed distance-0.4 nanometers ( nm ) - apart and that the electrons would have nowhere to go except between the rungs of the DNA ladder . <p> It had taken nearly 5 years of work to synthesize the molecules for the experiment , says Turro , but the results in 1993 convinced Barton and her colleagues of the reality of fast electron transfer through the pi-stack . <p> Contradictory results from other groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of transfer with an experimentally determined quantity they call beta . In proteins , beta is equal to about 1 , which means that electrons move along them only with great difficulty . Barton 's measurements on DNA revealed a beta of 0.2 , indicating that electrons zip along the strand with very little resistance . <p> Using a slightly different system of donors and acceptors attached to DNA , a second group at Caltech arrived at a lethargic beta value of about 1 . <p> Anthony Harriman of the Louis Pasteur University in Strasbourg , France , devised a system in which donors and acceptors intercalate into DNA , with random separations . He excited luminescence and traced how quickly the light died away . If electron transfer is fast , he argues , luminescence should fade quickly regardless of the distance between donors and acceptors . If electrons have trouble moving along DNA , however , the speed of decay should depend strongly on separation . <p> Using nearly 40,000 such measurements , Harriman assembled a statistical profile of the luminescence . " No other technique can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he claims . His results suggested an electron-transfer rate similar to that for a protein . <p> He casts doubt on the results obtained with tethered intercalators . " The molecules are so hard to make , no one has been able to duplicate the work yet , " Harriman complains . " If it 's so exotic that others ca n't repeat it , that 's a ridiculous state of affairs . " <p> Several other groups staked out a middle ground between the two extremes . They measured intermediate beta values . To them , DNA appeared to conduct better than a protein but still not as well as a true molecular wire . <p> For example , Frederick D. Lewis and his colleagues at Northwestern University in Evanston , Ill. , designed a molecular system to study how electron transfer depends on distance . Using only the paired bases adenine and thymine , they synthesized short strands of DNA having a molecule called stilbene at one end . Stilbene serves as an electron acceptor . At various locations along the strand they inserted the other pair of DNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served as the electron donor . <p> The researchers found that electron transfer indeed depended on strand length . They calculated a DNA beta value of about 0.6  --  which translates into a rate midway between the values obtained by Barton and Harriman . <p> Despite the reports of slower conductance , Barton feels that she and her coworkers have clearly demonstrated fast conduction through the pi-stack . She does n't rule out the slower conductances , however . " Everyone was getting different results , " she says . " If you think about the controversy , the mechanism had to be complicated . " <p> Theoretical work on the mechanism of the electron transfer has shed some light on this quandary . Assuming that electrons tunnel through the pi-stack , David Beratan of the University of Pittsburgh and his colleagues have modeled three experimental systems : Harriman 's , Barton 's , and one devised by Barton 's colleague Thomas J. Meade . So far , the theoretical models predict slow electron-transfer rates that drop with increasing distance between donor and acceptor molecules . Such models are consistent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , Beratan says . <p> He suggests , however , that more-sophisticated theoretical models may explain some of the discrepancies in these experimental results . Tunneling through the pi-stack turns out to be slow , but if the electrons travel by way of some other mechanism , they could potentially move much faster , says Beratan . <p> For example , Gary B. Schuster and his colleagues at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta have suggested a hopping mechanism , in which the charge leaps from the donor to a base to another base and so on down the line to the acceptor . In this case , Beratan explains , the electron could move very fast , perhaps rapidly enough to get the low beta value seen by Barton and her group . <p> In fact , the observations in any given experiment might result from a mixture of two mechanisms . Schuster and his coworkers have recently proposed that electrons travel via a series of short pi-ways in the DNA strand , hopping from the end of one pi-way to the beginning of the next . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) . <p> " The introduction of charge in DNA causes a distortion of the DNA strand to stabilize the charge , " says Schuster . This distortion brings the energy levels of the orbitals constituting the pi-stack closer together , thus facilitating the charge 's movement through the DNA strand . Furthermore , thermal motions of the DNA-known as phonons-push the charge down the strand . Schuster 's group calls this hybrid process " phonon-assisted polaron hopping . " <p> " We 've come to realize that DNA is not a static structure , " says Schuster . " Mechanisms that do n't consider this distortion are incomplete . " <p> Barton 's latest experiments , done in collaboration with her Caltech colleague Ahmed H. Zewail , support the importance of physical distortions and thus add to the evidence for a hybrid mechanism . <p> Zewail 's specialty is probing extremely fast chemical reactions with lasers . Using his technique , the researchers were able for the first time to directly measure the speed of an electric charge along a DNA molecule . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charge to travel 0.10 to 0.17 nm . However , the rate depends on the access that electrons have to the pi-stack . If the donor shifts away from the pi-stack , the charge takes 75 ps to travel the same distance . <p> " The sensitivity to the pi-stacking is extraordinary , " Barton says . She and Zewail describe their findings in the May 25 PNAS . <p> If DNA does conduct electricity , would n't Mother Nature have noticed ? " DNA is n't just some polymer , " says Barton . Its role as the carrier of genetic information suggests that organisms might take advantage of its electrical properties somehow . " The fact that DNA can transfer electrons probably has some biological implications , but no one knows what they are , " says Schuster . <p> Researchers can speculate , though . Since the 1960s , radiation biologists have wondered whether the effects of gamma rays can travel down DNA and cause damage . <p> In 1996 , Barton found that light shone on a tethered intercalator can oxidize pairs of adjacent guanines located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as tryptophans , can be intercalated into DNA , she adds . Perhaps some carcinogens wreak havoc with DNA by inserting themselves into the pi-stack . <p> Ironically , DNA might also repair itself with this process . Barton has found that electron transfer can fix a mutation known as a thymine dimer , in which two thymines on the same DNA strand bond together . <p> One encouraging finding suggests that cells might actually have the equipment to modulate the electrical properties of DNA . Barton 's group reports that an enzyme known as methyltransferase , which is ordinarily involved in DNA repair , can interrupt electron transfer by inserting an insulating chemical group into the pi-stack . The researchers report their finding in the June 16 Journal of the American Chemical Society . <p> The debate over electron transfer , at times , has gotten quite huffy . Is the latest evidence of a hybrid mechanism in DNA strong enough to settle the issue ? <p> " No ! " Barton declares . " I think the tide is moving in that direction , though . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , we can begin to talk about the mechanism . " <p> Though the exchanges between scientists researching this area are sometimes harsh , Barton feels they have lifted the quality of the research . " It pushes you to do better and better experiments . The more you learn , the more questions you have , " she says . <p> Schuster says that the saga of electron transfer in DNA exemplifies the scientific process : provocative initial observations , preliminary explanations , and finally , refinements of those theories . <p> " Science is a search for the truth , " he says . " Now , we 're beginning to circumscribe the truth . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A photon of light hits a charge-donating molecule ( red ) that has slipped into a strand of DNA .
