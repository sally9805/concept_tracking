<p> These are hard times for stock car drivers who would like to perpetuate the legend of the Alabama Gang , the unlikely bunch that roared out of little Hueytown , Ala. , three decades ago to dominate dirt tracks and superspeedways around the South . <p> Hut Stricklin , connected to the Gang by marriage , has not done much in 11 years to earn his place . He has n't won a race in 267 career starts and no longer has a full-time ride . <p> Steve Grissom , a Gang wannabe by virtue of his Gadsden birthplace , has n't won in seven years in Winston Cup and recently was released from his contract to drive the No. 41 Chevrolet . His winless streak : 128 . <p> The Gang lives on only in the record book . They will be remembered Sunday at the Winston 500 , when the Labontes can become the first brothers since the Gang 's Bobby and Donnie Allison in 1971 to sweep the two annual races at Talladega Superspeedway . <p> The Allisons , along with pal Red Farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traveled with their cars in a caravan and wiped out the competition at nearly every stop on dirt tracks in the 1960s and the speedways in the ' 70s and ' 80s . <p> " Back then , they certainly could call us a gang , " Donnie said , " because we 'd come in and take all their money . " Even if neither of them won , they 'd usually finish second , third and fourth . <p> The trio has nine victories at Talladega among them , five by Bobby . <p> In reality , they were the Miami gang . They had moved up to the Birmingham suburb after hearing that the tracks in Alabama and Georgia paid more for the same level of races than the tracks in Hialeah and West Palm Beach . <p> Bobby recalls taking $ 95 that he had saved on the road the first time . <p> " We left Miami and I was looking at my $ 95 and it was kind of going away . I said to Donnie , ' Instead of stopping to buy lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We keep passing these stands with baskets of peaches for 50 cents . We had peaches for lunch Thursday , peaches for supper Thursday , peaches for midnight snack , peaches for breakfast Friday and peaches for lunch Friday . <p> " We 're finally at Dixie Speedway . I ran fifth in the heat race , fifth in the semi and fifth in the feature . I told Donnie , ' I 'll go to the pay window , get out a couple bucks , we 'll go get a hamburger and we 'll sleep in the truck on the way back to Montgomery . So I go to the pay window . The guy counted me out $ 135 . That stack of money looked that tall . I celebrated with a $ 1.99 steak dinner and slept at a motel . " <p> No circle of friends has ever had more fun or success on race tracks . Or suffered as much tragedy . <p> Donnie 's career was cut short by a 1981 crash at Charlotte . Bobby 's career ended in a 1988 wreck at Pocono @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed to a second generation Gang , Bobby lost two sons to accidents . Clifford died in a 1992 practice crash at Michigan International Speedway . His brother , Davey , on the brink of becoming a star in the No. 28 car , was killed trying to land his helicopter at Talladega a year later . <p> Davey was going to watch Neil Bonnett , a family friend , practice at Talladega that day . In a cruel twist of fate , Bonnett was killed a year later during practice for the 1994 Daytona 500 . <p> Now , to get to Hueytown from Birmingham , you take an exit off I-20 onto Allison-Bonnett Drive . <p> The Allisons live out their painful pasts doing personal appearances at racing events and consulting for various race enterprises . Farmer suffered immensely , too . He was a passenger in Davey 's helicopter that day . His camper has a heart-shaped decal bearing the car numbers of Davey , Clifford and Bonnett and the words " Forever In Our Hearts . " <p> Farmer , who will be 67 on Thursday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his wife of 48 years , no longer goes to the track . <p> " I live with the memories every day , " she said . " You have to pass a room full of trophies to get anywhere in our house . I 've had my fill of going to races . It 's . . . too painful . Racing 's cost us too many dear friends and hurt two of them so bad they could n't get back in a race car . " <p> There have been young drivers in recent years who 've tried passing themselves off as members of a new Alabama Gang . Not so fast , Donnie said . <p> The Allisons and Farmer incorporated the Alabama Gang name two years ago . " We did it because of the people that were trying to use the name to solicit sponsors , " Donnie said . " We told them , ' Yeah , we 'll help you solicit sponsors , but the Alabama Gang corporation 's going make their fair share off it . ' " <p> The current crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  will never be card-carrying members of the Gang , Farmer said . " Back when we was racing , Bobby , Donnie and myself , we lived together in one apartment , we traveled together , we built cars together , we helped each other like brothers . They just do n't do that anymore . Everybody 's individuals now . " Bobby Allison In the last 10 years , Bobby Allison lost his racing career in a hellish accident , his sons Davey and Clifford in accidents , his wife to a divorce and most of his money as a race team owner . He can not remember big chunks of his life . <p> Although he walks with a limp , the result of his legs being crushed in the June 1988 crash at Pocono , he laughs at the thought of his daughter signing him up as host of a dance on a cruise in December . A pilot since 1967 , he uses his twin-engine Aerostar seven-seater like most folks use a car . He is back among his public . <p> But he can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I was enjoying life , but I do n't think that 's accurate . Life is a struggle , " Allison , 60 , said . " I still hurt every day . " <p> Allison is in the Talladega garage area , giving advice to ARCA driver Jimmy Kitchens . He is asked : Do you still like being around racing ? <p> " There are days that I do and days that I do n't , " he said . " There were days early on that I did n't want to be around and the team had my name on it and , of course , a lot of my investment in it . So they said I had to be there . " <p> But he would hide out in the team trailer , a contrast to his approach until 10 years ago . <p> " I was the ultimate people person , I thought , " he said . " Lots of friends , did lots of things . I was really busy . I was 50 years old , had won Daytona for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was doing the short racing . The eight days building up to the day that I got hurt at Pocono , I won two short track races and I did some personal appearances . <p> " I felt good , I felt healthy , I felt energetic and I was really enjoying Davey 's success . And I was hoping that Clifford would be able to follow along . Clifford was four years younger than Davey and had taken a little different route . " <p> He smiles as he remembers his boys . <p> " Davey was serious , always serious about racing . He wanted to race from the time he was a little-bitty guy . And he really pursued that , to the point that his mother threatened him one day that if he did n't do something else , have some other kind of enjoyment , she was going to whip him . <p> " Clifford , on the other hand , always was looking for whatever was the fun thing to do . The irony of life to me is Davey worked , worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . And Clifford played , played , played and got killed working ( in a track practice accident ) . <p> " Their personalities were unique and opposing to the point that Davey could be innocent when he was little and talk himself into a whipping . And Clifford would be guilty and talk himself into a raise in his allowance . " <p> Then he gets choked up , stares out in the distance to regain his composure and changes the subject . <p> There have been so many mountains to climb , beginning with the recovery from the wreck at Pocono that caused brain damage and serious memory loss . His recovery took years , and he still can not recall the Winston Cup races of ' 88 . <p> He said collaborating with racing writer Ben White on the book about his career , " Circle of Triumph , " brought back some memories . <p> " He and I talked quite a bit , " Allison said . " It was fairly early in my recovery and a lot of the conversations with him really helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory loss . Doing the book really helped me gain some of that back . " <p> He still has two daughters , his plane and his fishing . But he attributes the loss of his sons to the marriage breakup . <p> " The next divorce you see that 's friendly , call me collect , " Allison said . Donnie Allison Donnie Allison learned his lesson a long time ago . Be visible , and opportunity will come . <p> So he spends his weekends making personal appearances , working with a NASCAR truck team , golfing and fishing and hobnobbing in the garage area at Winston Cup races . <p> Allison , 59 , is involved with a group trying to put together a Cup team . <p> " The hardest thing about our business is speculation , " he said . " So many people want to do something , they 've got big plans and it never materializes . " <p> Allison is quite familiar what that sort of thing . <p> In 1981 , he suffered a severe concussion , a fractured cheekbone and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within six months but became NASCAR 's forgotten man . The downward spiral actually had begun earlier , when he was driving patchwork cars for obscure owners on pickup deals . <p> " After I got hurt , there was a period of time that I did n't go around the race tracks , " he said . <p> " I feel like now , looking back , 20-20 hindsight , that probably was a mistake . Once I got out of racing , I did not stay away . I 've been actively involved one way or another ever since . " <p> But he never felt forgotten by the public . " When I got hurt so bad , I got letters and cards from eight countries . " <p> Allison was perhaps the greatest crossover driver ever between NASCAR and Indy-car racing . He won 10 Winston Cup races . In 1970 , he finished fourth in the Indianapolis 500 and won the World 600 in Charlotte on the same weekend . He was NASCAR Rookie of the Year in 1967 and Indy Rookie of the Year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted came in the 1979 Daytona 500 , on the first nationally televised stock car race . He slugged it out with Cale Yarborough , with help from brother Bobby , after a race-ending wreck . Red Farmer The pit road area at Talladega Short Track is an unmarked patch of dirt behind a chain-link fence . When a car pulls in , it is not met by a uniformed pit crew . Drivers have to wave frantically to get the attention of their helpers . Winston Cup this ai n't . <p> Shane Rutledge has just pulled in with a flat tire on his beat-up Chevy . His two-man tire team is slow getting the lugnuts off . To let them know he is in a hurry , Rutledge keeps gunning his motor , unaware that he is trashing a legend . <p> The side-door exhaust is making a mess of Farmer , blowing red dirt in his red head , which is under the rear end of car F97 . Farmer is unscrewing some bolts to change the gearing . <p> " That was a rookie driver in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't realize what he was doing , " Farmer said . <p> NASCAR is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year with TV specials and lots of ceremony . Farmer , 66 , is celebrating his 50th year of racing , too , by playing in the dirt . He still races on dirt tracks around the South . On this recent afternoon , he is covered in grime , trying to keep a wounded machine moving in the Alabama Dirt Track Jamboree . <p> It 's just Red and a volunteer helper , Scott Meadows . One crew member is home with the flu , another is visiting his mother in the hospital . <p> Farmer wrecked the night before in the 30-lap late-model event.They 've changed gears , tires , springs and the entire front end from the wreck , just to get ready for the 40-lap Championship race that pays $ 3,000 to the winner . <p> " What else can we change on it , Scott ? " Farmer asked Meadows . " We 've changed everything but the number and paint job . " <p> Farmer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wrecked and was out on the fifth lap of the Championship , finishing his day by being pushed ingloriously to the pits by a tow truck . <p> Farmer is the last member of the Alabama Gang who still crawls through windows of race cars looking for the checkered flag . <p> " I never thought I 'd be racing 50 years after I started , " said Farmer , who has won nearly 800 features and has been recognized as one of NASCAR 's 50 greatest drivers . " When I was 15 years old , my mother figured I 'd never live to be 18 . And when I got 18 , she said I 'd never reach 21 , that I 'd probably kill myself . I was always kind of a wild child . If I had known I was going to live this long , I 'd have taken better care of myself . " <p> He can still beat drivers half his age .
