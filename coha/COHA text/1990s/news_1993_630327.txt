<p> Within 111 miles of this Wyoming village , you can bowl at the Oregon Trail Lanes , make a deposit at the Oregon Trail Bank , watch cars race at the Oregon Trail Speedway , wash the dust out at the Oregon Trail Lounge , spend a night in the Oregon Trail Motel , buy into Oregon Trail Estates or be buried at Oregon Trail National Cemetery . <p> But for the 359,000 souls who passed through here during three tumultuous decades of the mid-19th century , there was nothing to do but pitch camp for the night , then press on . Their destination was the west coast of America . Their goal was survival . <p> This is the 150th anniversary of the first and largest wagon train to cross the nearly 2,000 miles of prairie , mountain , desert and river between western Missouri and the Pacific Ocean . Dozens of celebrations , more than 100 package tours and several covered-wagon treks this summer are recalling the phenomenal six-month odyssey that tested the spirit and stamina of the American pioneer . <p> Behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . There were no streets paved with gold - the dream that lured European immigrants . Instead , the streets were lined with tenements , the people died from cholera and other diseases , and the important decisions were still made by the wealthy elite . <p> But to the west lay the frontier : free land for farming or ranching ; new villages that needed merchants , tradesmen and schoolteachers ; true religious freedom . It promised to be a fresh start . Getting there - that was the challenge . ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> I have had my helth tolerable well so far and am in no ways discouraged , but no man knows anything of the trip until he tryes it . It is attended with so much phatigue and danger that man knows not of , until he has had some experience . - G.W. Crane , June 12 , 1849 ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> The grand plan was to populate California , Oregon and Washington , a region not then belonging to America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed all of what is now Oregon . <p> The migration along the oregon Trail changed all that . <p> " When those floodgates opened , " notes Randy Wagner , " Britain backed off . By the end of 1846 , California and Oregon were de facto part of the United States . <p> " Those pioneers were achieving our ' manifest destiny . ' If those people had n't traveled when they did and if South Pass ( through the Rockies ) had n't been there , California , Oregon , Washington , Montana , western Wyoming and Idaho would now be part of Canada . " <p> Wagner - tall , slim and as natural in a cowboy hat as you 'd expect a 50-year resident of Wyoming to be - is the state 's sesquicentennial coordinator . He is also author of the Oregon Trail history on Wyoming 's 1993 maps and brochures . <p> Once the pioneers crossed the mountains at the wide South Pass of the Wind River Mountains , they set out on various routes west - the Mormons headed for Salt Lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But more of the main route , 487 miles , passes through Wyoming than through any of the other states on the Oregon Trail : Missouri , Kansas , Nebraska , Idaho and Oregon . <p> ( Oregon claims more than 500 miles , but that 's split into a couple of major routes . Also in dispute is the exact length of the trail , with the totals ranging from 1,932 miles up to something less than 2,100 . ) <p> When Wagner looks out over the plains , past the Platte River that largely dictated the route in Wyoming , he sees those Conestogas rolling along , the pioneers walking alongside . The wagons were for transporting their belongings and enough food and supplies to last the six-month trek . <p> After a few hours listening to Wagner , or standing in the 3-foot-deep wagon-wheel ruts here in Guernsey , or reading the historical exhibits at Scotts Bluff , Neb. ; Fort Laramie , Wyo. ; Fort Caspar , Wyo. , and any of dozens of other stops on the trail , you 'll picture the wagons , cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on the departure of the largest train of all : 1,000 people , about 5,000 head of livestock and 120 wagons left Independence , Mo. , in May , 1843 . The train members had been recruited by a missionary looking to populate his settlement at Fort Walla Walla ; by that September , most of them were settling along the Willamette and Columbia rivers , in what is now Oregon . <p> Later trains were recruited by mountain men and trappers , who often served as the scouts and guides . Within a few years , however , guides were not necessary to find what the pioneers always called " the road , " because the trail had been worn down by passage of so many feet , hooves and wagon wheels . <p> The trains that followed were never as large as that first massive expedition ; sometimes they were just five to 10 wagons . Except for the few places where the landscape demanded , the " trail " was really a corridor , with the wagons spread hundreds of yards across so that the people did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front . <p> They typically advanced just 15 miles a day ; the fastest wagon train might average a little more than 20 miles a day for the whole trip . Camp would be broken early , with a stop around 11 to let the stock graze . They would set out again around 2 or 3 , but would quit for the day well before dusk . <p> " These were rolling communities , " says Wagner , " doing the things that communities did , except on the move - births , deaths , weddings . " The common practice before the wagon trains was that you were born , grew up , worked and died within about 30 miles of one place . But the intention and sound conviction ( of the wagon-train members ) when they left Missouri was ' good-bye . ' Of course , leaving Missouri was also leaving the United States . " <p> And that meant leaving civilization - and doctors . As many as 36,000 people , about one in 10 travelers , died trying to make the trek between 1843 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> We have a great deal of sickness on the road at this time . We pass companies every hour of the day waiting for someone to get better or to die . - John H. Clarke , May 29 , 1852 . ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> The wagons were dubbed " prairie schooners " because the train spent weeks crossing the ocean of grass that was Kansas and " the sea of Nebraska . " <p> They needed the grass for the animals , and they followed the twists of the Little Blue and Platte rivers , so they could be close to water . The individual trains gradually grew smaller , as wagons broke down or were abandoned because their loads of supplies were used . <p> Historians still occasionally find bottles of patent medicine , and Wagner carries part of a rusted ox shoe in his truck . Mary Schmit , the operator of a restored hotel in Deadwood , S.D. , tells of growing up on a Nebraska farm near the Platte and of having her own abandoned covered wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( STAR ) <p> My wife and I carried our children up muddy mountains in the Cascades ( in Oregon ) , half a mile high , and then carried the cargo of our wagons up on our backs by piecemeal , as our cattle were so reduced that they were hardly able to haul up the empty wagon . - W.L. Adams , 1848 . ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> After their first 30 to 40 days crossing the treeless prairie , the pioneers would spot a landmark they called Chimney Rock , in what is now far western Nebraska . The column of sandstone stretched about 600 feet above the grasslands - so tall it was visible for two days before it was reached . <p> For the pioneers , it was a source of joy after weeks of tedium broken only by uncertainty . Over and over , historians relate , diaries kept by the pioneers refer to special places on the trail as " seeing the elephant " - maybe a reference to spotting some marvelous thing . Chimney Rock was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 470 feet over the prairie , though World War I artillery practice shortened it by 100 feet , and lightning knocked off a chunk in the past year . <p> Nearby , the Howard family operates the Oregon Trail Covered Wagon attraction . Visitors can take a brief ride in a horse-drawn wagon past some depressions in the ground said to be original wagon-train ruts and past a mound believed to be Pony express Station N0. 134 . Afterward , customers get a great steak-and-beans dinner . Or they can take a multi-day wagon train trip through the countryside . While they follow ruts , the contemporary passengers can only imagine what trail life was really like . <p> " The men generally thought it was a helluva lot of fun - a summer off from their regular duties , such as farming . Instead they got to go hunting , " relates Wagner . " Many , later in life , would reflect on it as the greatest summer of their lives . <p> " For women , it was the same old thing , cooking , sewing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different place every day . " <p> About 25 miles west of Chimney Rock is the next great natural landmark , Scotts Bluff , a great block of stone towering 800 feet above the river valley . The Platte raged through this area for millenniums , wearing away the sandstone - and in the past century , harassing the wagon trains . It has since been tamed with 12 dams beginning where it forms out of the melted snow from the Rockies . <p> Today 's travelers to Scotts Bluff National Monument , at the western edge of Nebraska , can walk or drive a twisting , paved road to the top for a spectacular view of the flatlands . The wagon train members were tourists , too ; and after pitching camp , many would troop over to this and other interesting formations along the trail - seeing the elephant . <p> About 60 miles farther along the Platte 's course is one of the fascinating sites that the train members made into a tourism stop : Register Cliff . A sandstone hill about 150 feet tall , much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dates and sometimes messages from those heading west . Still visible in script plain and fancy are such notations as : " J.W. Robb , 1852 , U.S. Post . " And inside a valentine heart : " Craig of Dubuque , May , 1850 . " <p> There are two other major " registries " - Names Hill and Independence Rock - in Wyoming alone . But Register Cliff was the first on the trail . <p> The cliff was about a day 's journey from Fort Laramie , originally established in 1834 as a trading post for fur traders . By 1849 , the stop had been bought by the government and converted to what would become a major Army post , to protect , restock and repair the wagon trains . It is now a fascinating National Historic Site , with numerous buildings dating as far back as the 1850s rebuilt and refurbished to represent the fort 's history . <p> At its busiest , in 1877 , about 750 men answered Fort Laramie 's roll call . That was about 3 percent of the entire Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the last outpost of civilization until Fort Bridger - about 300 miles , or two weeks ' journey , to the west . <p> The post surgeon and general-store owner , or suttler , could get rich dealing with the wagon trains . The doctor , already paid as much as the commanding officer , would charge civilians 50 cents to a dollar for treatment . The suttler could make $ 25,000 a year - more than eight times what the commanding officer was paid . <p> The Army was also authorized to help wagon train members who suffered the greatest loss on the trail - the death of the husband or father . If no single man or other family was willing to help the widow or mother , she could be given money , with the stipulation that she return to the nearest area of civilization . In other words , to turn back . <p> Of course , the vast prairies were already inhabited when the early fur trappers and traders arrived . For decades , the Plains Indians coexisted peacefully with the white emigrants along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wagons across the rivers . They traded with each other - manufactured items such as blankets and guns for fresh food and items made from the plentiful buffalo . But gradually the Indians came to realize that the wagon trains were not merely passing through but that more and more of the buffalo and the lands were being taken by the newcomers . <p> The lengthy wars with the Plains Indians began close to what is now Lingle , Wyo . On Aug. 19 , 1854 , Brevet Lt. John Grattan from nearby Fort Laramie took 30 soldiers to arrest a Sioux Indian for shooting a cow belonging to a Mormon wagon train . A shot was fired , apparently panic ensued , and all of the soldiers were killed , along with a Sioux chief . <p> There were numerous small and large battles begun by both sides throughout the vast plains , until all Indian leaders either surrendered or were captured and suppressed on reservations by the last decades of the century . <p> By then , the Oregon Trail had long ceased to be the corridor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emigration , but completion of the trans-continental railroad did . When the Golden Spike was driven in Utah in 1869 , it ended the need for each farmer or family to gather all their possessions and make the great crossing by foot or wagon . What had been a six-month journey became a six-day ride , soon cut to four days . <p> As for the trail itself , parts were used into this century . The western states would grade but not pave certain stretches . One man who had crossed the trail in 1852 as a teenager decided in 1913 to erect a series of simple granite markers . Typical of the hardy spirit of the pioneers , he was 75 when he began his two-year mission . Many of these markers are still visible on state and county roadsides . Recently , hundreds of other signs have been erected as part of the sesquicentennial . <p> If you know where to look , you can still see depressions - and even stand in the remarkable ruts worn through the sandstone . Ruts are clearly visible at Rock Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at several places in Oregon . <p> And right here in Guernsey , you can find the deep ruts easily enough : The entrance is just across the road from Larson Park , the municipal golf course . <p> Robert N.
