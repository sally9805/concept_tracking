TITLE : INDOCHINE <P> DIRECTOR : REGIS WARGNIER <P> WRITERS : ERIK ORSENNA , LOUIS GARDEL , CATHERINE COHEN AND REGIS WARGNIER <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : Catherine Deneuve lends glamour and gravity to a moving epic of the French in Vietnam . <P> IF YOU WERE TO SELECT AN AMBASsador of European culture , it might be Catherine Deneuve . If you were to choose a film to express the agony and ambiguity of Vietnam in this century , it should be Indochine . <P> The French have an itch to colonize . For centuries they explored , exploited and educated on three continents . Now their working tours of Africa , North America and Southeast Asia are over . The reverie fades like a holiday suntan ; the legacy lingers like a scar . Why should n't that wound , which France inflicted on itself and its colonial subjects , be diagnosed on a big screen ? Spurred by conscience , retrospection and , not least , the success of Hollywood movies about the U.S. war in Southeast Asia , French moviemakers are gazing into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is blurred by tropical humidity and nostalgie de la boue . Whatever the reason , the French view of Southeast Asia is less wide- and wild-eyed than Oliver Stone 's version in Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July . The perspective in Jean-Jacques Annaud 's The Lover is as cloistered in its 1920s Saigon love nest as the French were from awareness of the impending revolution . Pierre Schoendoerffer 's Dien Bien Phu ( yet to open in the U.S. ) meticulously restages the climactic French defeat as if it were all about artillery and not national destinies . The French are at times inhibited by good taste and historical scrupulousness . <P> Regis Wargnier 's Indochine takes a gentler , more comprehensive approach . It suggests that the French , at the twilight of their long rule in Indochina , saw themselves not as the region 's colonizers  --  ravaging its natural and human resources  --  but as its foster parents , nourishing a lovely , lorn child with the civilizing bounty of French culture . That , anyway , is Indochine 's explicit metaphor . Eliane ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raises Camille ( Linh Dan Pham ) , an orphan princess of Annam , as her own daughter . What could separate these two beautiful women ? Only the nationalist uprising of the 1940s and the women 's competing love for a handsome French officer ( Vincent Perez ) , a kind of Lieut . Pinkerton in this Mademoiselle Saigon . <P> Filmed in Vietnam , Malaysia , Switzerland and France , covering 155 minutes of screen time and 30 years of convulsive history , Indochine sprawls and enthralls . It has the breadth and intelligence of the David Lean epics from whose plots it borrows : the juggling of passion and politics in Doctor Zhivago , the muddle of racial emotions in A Passage to India , the grandiose failure of colonial outsiders in The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia . But Indochine 's vision is essentially feminine ; its ample grief is that of a mother mourning her lost children in a land shifting and receding under her feet .               @ @ @ @ @ @
