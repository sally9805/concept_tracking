Few people are knocking at Robert Wescott 's door these days to find out who might win the next presidential election . It 's still too early for that . But the door knockers will be back . For Wescott , 38 , a bespectacled forecaster recently named to a senior staff position on the President 's Council of Economic Advisers , is the originator of an uncannily accurate political rule : the incumbent party wins re-election only if Americans ' real disposable income grows at 3.7% or better during the 12 months prior to Election Day . Anything below that , and it 's curtain time . <P> Bill Clinton has two more years before Wescott 's rule kicks in . Some recent signs suggest that the sputtering recovery might just be starting to hum . Inflation is down to a barely visible 2.5% , and low interest rates are going lower . Last week Morgan Guaranty and Harris Trust and Savings Bank dropped their prime lending rate half a percentage point , to 5.5% . Under Clinton , unemployment has also fallen , from 7% to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new jobs each month  --  roughly twice 1992 's pace . Stocks are up to record heights . Investment in plant and equipment is hitting levels not seen since 1984 . Auto sales are at their highest since 1989 ; single-family housing starts are spurting . Says David Hale , chief economist at Kemper Financial Companies : " The U.S. economy appears poised for at least a temporary lift-off . " <P> But what about Wescott 's yardstick ? Despite the upbeat statistics , real disposable income inched ahead barely 2% over the past year . The ample supply of labor and efforts by companies to trim costs have held down wage and salary increases . " The United States is finally entering a period of sustained , moderate growth fueled by low interest rates , " notes Laura D'Andrea Tyson , Clinton 's chief economic adviser ( and Wescott 's new boss ) . " But we would still like to see higher employment , the creation of more permanent jobs and stronger American exports . " Tyson is forecasting modest 3% growth in the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is whether even that pace can be maintained . <P> Nearly every positive sign of renewed growth turns out to have a negative catch . The good news on unemployment is more than tempered by the alarming persistence of long-term joblessness . " Even reasonably healthy companies are cutting their payrolls , " Labor Secretary Robert Reich said recently . " In September , American businesses were slashing jobs at the rate of more than 2,000 a day  --  even though profits are rising . " As the wave of corporate downsizing continues , some 20% of those unemployed have been out of work at least six months , twice the level of the 1970s . Even low interest rates have a downside : they not only hurt retirees and others living on investment income , but they also encourage millions of Americans to shift out of federally insured bank accounts and certificates of deposit into potentially more lucrative  --  and certainly more volatile  --  equities and mutual funds . The long predicted  --  and long postponed  --  stock market correction could hit personal savings hard .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
