 | " Loonie there said it was dog . Ai n't no finer food , he thinks . Eats ' em all the time . War n't bad , was it ? " " That was my dog we ate ? " asked Morgan . " Likely , " said Patch . " Dogs is scarce as hen 's teeth in these parts . Wild Injuns eat ' em , too . " " Pa ? " Morgan turned to his father . Lemuel shrugged . " I 'm a-goin ' to kill him , " said Morgan , looking at Loonie . But he thought of the meal they had eaten and felt his stomach buck . He doubled over and vomited , tears streaming from his eyes . He staggered away from the campfire , deathly ill . " Shame to waste a good supper like that , " said Patch . Lem stood there helplessly , watching his son retch .

" He could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loon laughed soundlessly , his hands weaving curious images in the air as the sun died in cold flames over the horizon .  | Morgan stopped vomiting , finally . His face flushed and the veins stood out like ruddy ropes on his neck . He balled up his fists , wiped his mouth with his sleeve . He glared at Looking Loon , a rage flaring in his eyes . " Morg , " warned Lemuel . " You sonofabitch , " said Morgan , breaking into a run toward the Delaware . " Whoa there , " said Patch , sticking out a buckskinned leg . Morgan did n't see the barrier in time . He pitched forward , fell straight into the fire , skidded through it in a boil of sparks , scattered chunks of flaming wood and cherry-red coals . " Yow ! " exclaimed Morgan as a hot coal burned his stomach . The Delaware rose to his feet , put a hand on the buckhorn handle of his skinning knife . Lem reached for his own knife , but did not draw it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sparkling coals on his belly . " Simmer down , boy , " said Patch , still sitting by the fire . " Loonie there 'll slit your gullet and think no more of it than squashing a bug . " " He kilt my dog , " said Morgan , struggling to his feet . He brushed soot and ashes from his buckskin shirt . " He did n't know it was your dog , " said Patch . " And he did n't mean no harm . Fact is , he was a-tryin ' to do some good , give us all some vittles to fill our empty bellies . " " It ai n't right , " said Morgan , still glowering . " Sonny , you got some lessons to learn , " said Patch softly . Lem said nothing , but he kept his eyes on the Delaware , who still gripped the antler handle of his knife . " Whatcha mean by that ? " asked Morgan . Patch stood up slowly , careful to make no sudden move . He stood where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan . Sparks still glittered in the dry grasses around the fire and tendrils of smoke rose from some that had caught fire briefly , died out . " Well , now , that little dog of yours , he was a civilized dog , war n't he ? " " I reckon , " said Morgan sullenly . " My guess is he never would have made it to the mountains , nohow . They ai n't no laws out here and there 's lots of Injuns what love dogmeat . And , if Loonie there had n't of et him , then somethin ' else would have made a meal of him . Might of been a griz or a timber wolf or a painter , but sooner or later that dog would have wound up in one belly or another . " " I could of took care of him , " argued Morgan . " I can see that , " said Patch , smiling . " Ai n't no need to rag the boy , " said Lemuel , his voice stony hard .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A dog ai n't worth a man 's life , nor a boy 's either . " " I ai n't no boy , " said Morgan .

Ai n't no rules out here , Morgan Hawke , ' ceptin ' those you make as you go along gettin ' snakebit and ball froze and clawed and chased and shot at . Them 's the rules you live by or you do n't live long . " " Well , dammitall , " said Morgan , " he ought to pay me for my dog . " " Morgan , " said Lemuel . " Pay you ? " asked Patch . " For what ? For fixin ' your supper ? Fillin ' your belly ? " " I lost my supper , " said Morgan . " Ai n't Loonie 's fault . He did what he thought was right . Now you back off and do some thinkin ' on this . That Injun might not talk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaner'n a cornered painter when his back 's up . " Patch made a sign to Looking Loon . The Delaware laughed soundlessly and took his hand away from his knife . He held up his hand , palm out flat , in the sign of peace . " He wants to make friends with you , Morgan , " said Patch . " All you have to do is hold up your right hand to show him you ai n't got no weapon . " " I ai n't a-gonna do it . " " Morgan , " said Lem again . " All right . " Morgan held up his empty right hand . The Delaware grinned . He made signs with both hands , but neither Lem nor his son understood . " Loonie thinks you got sick on the meat . He still does n't know that was your dog . He 's sorry if his cookin ' do n't agree with you . " " What ? " asked Morgan .  | Lem started to laugh . Patch joined in . The Delaware bounced up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idiocy of it and began to laugh , too . He pointed to Loonie , then rubbed his belly . Loonie rubbed his own belly , then acted out the vomiting sickness . He danced around , showing them all what had happened to Morgan . Patch howled with glee . Lemuel doubled up , gasped for breath . Morgan laughed t ntil tears came to his eyes . Later , as he lay in his blankets , Morgan looked up at the stars . He could hear Patch snoring softly . His father was asleep beside him in his own bedroll . The Indian lay in a sitting position with his back against his saddle . Morgan did n't know if Looking Loon was asleep or not . He thought about Friar Tuck and the things that Patch had said . Perhaps the dog would not have survived the journey to the mountains in any case . But , it was sad to think of the dog in his last moments , probably wagging his tail and trying to make friends with the Indian . He hoped Loonie killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that . He would miss the dog , but he 'd get over it , just like he got over his mother . Almost . Lem , Morgan , Patch and Looking Loon rode into Independence the next morning . Camped just outside the settlement were several groups of men , some of them drunk , most of them noisy and full of ginger . Some shot off their fusils and shouted a greeting to the newcomers . But others stood around in morose groups , strangely silent , smoking their pipes like mourners at a funeral . " Somethin 's up says this chile , " said Patch . The Missouri was over its banks , its waters raging , tossing chunks of driftwood and trunks of trees in its turbulent maelstrom . A keelboat lay on its side , well off the bank , its hull  | caved in , a large gaping hole below the waterline . Several men encircled a man lying on his back . Two men were pushing on his chest and belly , slapping his face . The man on the ground was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa , is that man dead ? " asked Morgan . " I du n no , " said Lem . " He do n't look alive . " " Deader'n a stump , " said Patch . He and Looking Loon spoke in quick sign . " There 's Jocko DeSam , " said Morgan , pointing to a buckskinned trapper at the edge of one group . " I thought he was long gone up that river , " said Lem . " Ai n't nobody goin ' up that there Missoura , " said Patch . " Look at that keelboat stove in . " A tall man walked away from the group surrounding the dead man . He was smartly dressed in fringed buckskins , a brace of pistols tucked in his sash . The shoulders of his shirt were gaudily decorated with quillwork and his moccasins were colorfully beaded . He carried a large , knife , possibles bag , powder horns . The man looked at the newcomers and frowned . " Who 's that ? " asked Lem . " That tall feller ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slick as a buckhorn blade , wily as a timber wolf . That 's one of his boats a-lyin ' there . He had him three last I knew . " " There 's the other two , " said Morgan , pointing upstream . " They 're busted up , too . " Lem saw the boats . They were even more badly battered than the one close by . One of them had a tree driven through its hull . The other did n't look like a boat so much as a pile of broken lumber . As they rode closer , the noise of the river increased , roaring in their ears like a flood . Men were climbing over the broken hulks of the keelboats , salvaging their packs , food , weapons , p 56 traps , odds and ends . Several of the men onshore were clad in sodden buckskins , hatless , their hair flattened with dampness . The waters of the Missouri boiled with angry gray and black water . A man looking through the debris cursed in several tongues , angrily threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stuck . A man spread out his blankets to dry in the sun , shook his head as he looked at the destruction around him . Morgan and Lem saw DeSam arguing with a taller man , shaking his fist . " Same old Jocko , " said Lem . Lem and Morgan could not hear the voices above the roar of the river , but Jocko DeSam stopped shaking his fist at the taller man and turned toward them . Morgan lifted his hand in a tentative wave . Jocko turned from the man , waved back . In a few moments he called out to them . " Bienvenue , mes amis , " called Jocko DeSam , walking toward them . " You have come , at last . There has been much rain up on the river , look what she do to our boats . We have lost several horses and mules . Some men have gone to look for them upstream . But I saw a dead mule float by a few minutes ago , . nacre bleu ! " " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do now , Jocko ? " " Ah , some will fix the boats , but I am going to walk , no ? It will not be so fast , but c'est la vie , non ? " " We been lost , " said Morgan . " Maybe that is good , non ? The wind she blow and the twister , she tear everything up . " Several of the villagers stood next to trader 's tents , jabbering in low tones . " Light down , " said Patch . " Looks like there 's goin ' to be a pow-wow. "  | " What 's that ? " asked Morgan . " Talkin ' " said Patch . " Them as figger to use the river are going to have to go overland , either up it or straight acrost to the Platte . " " What about you ? " asked Lem . " All the same to me . I did n't figger to find room on a keelboat nohow . " Lem and Morgan dismounted . Jocko DeSam , whose real name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had first met the French trapper in Kentucky . All three had shared a jail cell together after a brawl in a hatter 's establish-ment . " Where can we ford ? " asked Lem . " Where did you come cross the river ? " asked DeSam . He showed no trace of the anger he had shown the tall man , who now seemed to be barking orders at some of the other trappers . " Way down yonder where the Osage feeds in . We just hopped from gravel bar to gravel bar . " " Ah , the gravel bar . She is always big trouble for the boats . But , I think we go up the river , non ? " Lem and Morgan exchanged looks . " Ai n't that where you broke up ? " asked Lem . " But the storm she has passed , non ? The river she will calm down like a woman when she is petted and we will find a place to cross . Even if we do not , we can always climb the hills like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to see the humor . They were going into a great unknown , and so far , they had seen that unknown turn savage . Jocko beckoned to them . He walked back to the rubble and picked out his horse and pack animals . Dick Hauser emerged from behind a broken keelboat and waved to them . Men looked at Jocko as if he had gone insane . " Wait 'll I get my horse , " said Dick . " I 'll ride with you . " p 58 " Ha , you are one crazy man , Dick , " said Jocko . " We go without the boat . " " I ai n't stayin ' around here , " said Hauser . " That goddamned Scotsman 's plumb crazy . " He jabbed a thumb toward the man the Hawkes had seen arguing with Jocko . Hauser was a lean , scraggle-bearded man , five foot nine or so , with a chaw of tobacco bulging one cheek . His buckskins were worn smooth , black from charred wood and streaked with grease from past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God almighty . " Lem smiled wanly . He felt nervous around Dick Hauser . He was a man he had thought dead , killed by Tuscarora Indians back in the Cumberlands , only to turn up alive and seasoned in St. Louis . His partner , Ormly Shields , had n't been seen , but Dick said that he had survived the war party as well . A tall man , dressed in a light capote , buckskin trousers and leggings , separated himself from a party of men working on one of the damaged keelboats . He walked towards Jocko and the Hawkes as Dick caught up his horse and pack mules . " Uh-oh , " said Jocko , " we are going to get the argument . Do you have your licenses ? " " Who 's that ? " asked Morgan , staring at the broad-shouldered man DeSam had been shaking a fist at moments before . The stranger carried a big knife thrust in a studded leather scabbard in his sash . The man wore a wide-brimmed hat with a large eagle feather jutting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It looked like a toy in his oversized hand . The man wore a neatly trimmed beard , large sideburns . His hair was thick and shorn just above the shoulders . A large birthmark colored his forehead like a swatch of rust or faded vermillion . " That is the Major , " said Jocko , sotto voce . " Old Angus himself . " p 59 Jocko had mentioned the Major before , back in Kentucky when they had first met . " Do you work for him ? " asked Lem . " Not anymore , " said the Frenchman bitterly . " Shusss ! Be careful . He 's now the booshway . " Before Lem could ask Jocko what he meant , Major Angus Llewellyn MacDougal was upon them , taller than the horses . " Och , Jocko , do you leave us with the boats to go on ahead ? " " Mail oui , " said Jocko DeSam . " We ride the river . " " Who is this boy ? " demanded MacDougal . " I hope he 's here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much too young to go to the mountains . And you , " he said to Lem , " if you 're going past this point , I 'll need to see your license . " Lem took papers wrapped in oilcloth out of his possibles pouch . Ile had obtained his trapper 's license from the French bourgeois , the " booshway , " just before leaving St. Louis . But Morgan had not been with him , and Lem had not gotten a license for his son . Usually , the brigade leader saw to it that all his men were licensed , but Lem had spoken to Pierre Choteau , Sr. , and gotten a license through the St. Louis Missouri Fur Company . Lem handed the license papers to the Major . MacDougal looked at them , frowned , then handed them back . " Those are just for you . The boy can not go . " " He 's my boy , " said Lem . " And he 's a-goin ' . " Angus scoured Lem with a raking look , cocking one eyebrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aye , and you 'll bury the lad somewhere between here and die land of the Crow . How old are ye , laddie ? " " I 'm fifteen , " said Morgan , bristling as he thrust out his chest . " We come all the way from Kentucky , my pa and me. "  | Calvin " Pappy " Roth and Nat Sullard joined DeSam 's bunc Major MacDougal watched the men go , the only sign of hi anger a clenched fist that he quickly flexed back to normal on everyone had seen it . He smiled to himself with the secreti smile of a man who has just set a concealed trap . As the small band of men and Hawke 's boy , Morgan , rod from sight , Angus walked over to a man working on one of the keelboats . Fletcher Bancroft was a short , muscular man with sloping shoulders , a heavy beetled brow , hair matted and tangled to his shoulders . He was bare to the waist and carried a ten-pound maul in his gnarled left hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannon . " We lost the bow gun , Major , " said the man . " Never mind that . How long before we 're in the water ? " " Two days , three maybe . " p 63 " I want one boat loaded and ready to sail on the morrow . " " Too damned soon , Major . " " Not soon enough , Fletch . Tomorrow . Put all available men on a single craft . You pass the word , then there 's something I want you to do . " " What might that be , Major ? " " I want you to get three men and go after Jocko . Bring him back to me . " " He wo n't like it none . " " He knows too much to go on ahead . I do n't want him as competition . " " You want me to kill him , Major ? " " That would be an acceptable alternative . " " How 's that ? " " Yes , if you ca n't get him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bring the lad back here , too . I 'll not have a young ' un muckin ' up the year 's work . We 'll put him in irons and send him back to St. Louis . " Fletcher grinned . He threw down his maul and started calling out to the men working on the keelboats . " Hear ye , hear ye ! " he yelled . " Gather ' round and listen up , you mangy bunch of gap-toothed louts . We got work to do ! " Angus smiled that strange slow smile of his . There was no warmth in it . It was the smile of a mourner at a funeral where his worst enemy was going six feet underground . A few yards away , Patch Sisco slunk back behind a stack of barrels . He had gone there to piss and had heard every word between Major MacDougal and that worthless scoundrel , I ' ! richer . But something about the Major 's behavior made him wonder if Angus was n't up to something . He had the odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto a stage , give a  | speech and then go off the boards to laugh at everyone in the audience . Dick Hauser joined Jocko , Lem and Morgan as they rode away from Independence . " Feller tolt me they was some pirogues cached up yond and some feller put a bullboat in the bushes thirty mil upriver . " " That is good , " said Jocko . " I will bet the prime beaver ple we can find a keelboat with some room if they put the boat t shore when the storm she hit . " " We might get lucky , " said Hauser . " We could n't fit all these goods in a pirogue , " said Lem . " No , but the river could carry some of us until we find a hi keelboat . There were three or four boats ahead of us . " " Seems like a lot of fuss . Horse can take a man anywhere . " Ah , but not like the boats , eh ? In the boats , a man can look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close non ? " Lem laughed wryly . " I think I 'd rather be on dry land , " said Morgan . " We will see , " said Jocko cryptically . Morgan rode away from the others , swelling up inside wi the immensity of the country , feeling dwarfed by the sk Cottonwood trees marked the serpentine course of the rive green beacons cutting a swath through wild prairie . Morg glutted himself on it , watching every waterbird take Sigh gazing in awe at the bluffs that seemed like monuments built I some ancient giant . He saw eagles and hawks , the lazy carouse of turkey buzzards , floating in circles on invisible currents air . He heard the yawp of a blue heron and watched its ungainly p 65 stride as it flapped across a sandbar , disturbed from its fishing by the passing horsemen and pack animals . Morgan felt his own muscles strain until it finally gained flight and soared above the trees , majestic at last . That night , they camped below some bluffs some fifteen miles upriver from Independence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard . " With the rocks behind us , we do not have so much to watch , eh ? " " You think Indians will attack us ? " asked Morgan . " I do not think so , but sometimes they are very quiet and when they do not want to trade , they like to take the hair and the goods for free . " Jocko laughed at his joke . Morgan looked at his father . Lem only shrugged and began to strip the mules of their cargo . Morgan thought it would have been better to have ridden to the top of the limestone bluffs where they would be able to see and hear anyone approach , but he said nothing . There were signs that others had been to this place before . There were burned rocks and flattened grasses , remains of firewood . For such a big country , it seemed to attract a lot of travelers . I lowever , he knew that once someone left the river , or rode away from a creek , such country would swallow them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to water , or die . The dank smell of the river wafted on the close summer air as dusk drew the shadows long and thickened in the grasses and on the ground . The littoral cacophony of insects shattered the silence and a great horned owl hooted like a rooster with laryngitis , its bass notes quavering in the distance . " No fires , " whispered Pappy Roth , as he strode up to the Hawkes . " Jocko says to stay quiet . " p 66 Pappy turned on his heel and went back to where the others were making camp for the night . " Pa , do you think we 'll see Indians ? " " No . Jocko probably knows what to do . Just keep your eyes open and do n't make no noise . " Morgan finished stripping Boots and helped his father unload the panniers from the pack saddles . He and I.cm hobbled their horses and put all the stock on a single tether line , anchored it to a cottonwood in sight of their camp . They broke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each night along their journey . " Let 's us find us a spot to ourselves , Morg , " said Lem , taking one of the wooden canteens and a leather pouch that they carried their " day grub " in . " Get some food in us and talk , just you and me . " Morgan grinned . Sometimes his pa made him feel full growed . They walked to a spot down the bluff where there was s slight depression , almost a cave . Lem hunkered down and searched through the " day grub " pouch for some dried elk and fried dough . " Set , " he told Morgan . " What you wanta talk about , Pa ? " Lem handed his son a chunk of brisket and an oblong pie of fried dough . He held an index finger to his lips . " Well , we done started , " said Lem , biting into anoth quarter pound of dried brisket , " and so far not much has go right . I got me a bad feeling ' bout this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pa ? " " Did n't say that , son . It 's just that it seems that Major fell back downriver did n't like us all goin ' none . And , they 's got t be some reason these mountain trappers go in such big bunches . " p 67 " Indians , likely , " said Morgan , chewing a morsel of suntoughened meat . " Likely . So , I think we better watch ourselves , ever ' step of the way . DeSam has got him a grudge with that MacDougal , and if you notice , he keeps watchin ' over his shoulder . " " I noticed . " Lem swallowed a half-chewed wad of elk meat . His Adam 's apple bobbed and rippled like a snake swallowing a field mouse . " We stay together all the time , you and me , Morg . Do n't trust nobody too much . " " Aw , Pa .... " " You just mind your P 's and Q 's , like I say . " " I will , Pa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Lem . " Like what , Pa ? " " I ca n't rightly say . But , I got me somethin ' pricklin ' at me like a itch . " " Maybe it 's because we do n't know where we 're goin ' , " said Morgan . Lem nodded . They spoke no more until they had finished washing down the last of their supper with the warm water from the canteen . DeSam called all of them together just before dark . " We all have the fatigue , no ? " he said . " But , we do not all sleep at once , eh ? Maybeso , we draw the grasses to see who take the turns standing guard . I will take the watch nobody else wants . We do the four watches . Dark to the tenth hour , the tenth hour to the midnight , the midnight to the third hour and the third hour until the light she break . We start with the longest blade of grass . Does it not make the sense ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blades of p 68 grass with his knife , handed them to Jocko . Jocko turned hi back on the assemblage and bit the grass stalks to vario lengths , counted out four blades . He fisted his hand , held the jutting grasses to each man . I I skipped Morgan . " We got us an extry two men , " said Dick Hauser . " We will have the two men on the last of the watch , " DeSam . " I want to draw one , " said Morg . " Non , " said Jocko softly . Morgan 's face reddened and he started to rise . Lem put hand on his shoulder , pressing him back down . " But , Pa . . . " " When you get a little more experience , " said Lem . " Aw , but . . . " Lem silenced him with a narrowing of his eyes , a slight shake of his head . Dick won the eight to ten watch , Pappy the ten to midnight Nat Sullard had the next shortest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to make the change ? " ask Jocko . They all shook their heads . " I will take the last watch with Lem Hawke , " said DeSam " I could do it with you , Pa , " said Morgan as the two walk toward their bedrolls . " I know , son . Let Jocko run it his way until he gets to know you better . " " But , I want to watch , too . " " Why do n't you ask Dick if he needs some he'p ? " said Le Morgan 's eyes flashed with light . He ran off to talk t Hauser while Lem laid out his rifle and pistols , checking t pans and flints . Dusk crept over the camp , shawling out the last of t  | estern light . Frogs croaked in the river bottoms , and insects wed a cacophony of sound . Lem sat there on his bedroll , stening to a whippoorwill yammering from a nearby tree . Morgan came back , a hangdog expression on his face . " Dick did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Set , then . If you 're a-itchin ' , best you start lookin ' . I done ilt four ticks and swatted two of the biggest ' skeeters I ever w . Lem scratched his leg , probed inside the tops of his occasins . He dug a tick out of his flesh and put a thumbnail to it . Morgan reached back over his shoulder , put a hand inside his shirt . He , too , found a tick and sliced it in two with his fingernails . " Likely , there 's more , " said Lem . " I can feel the little boogers , " said Morgan , searching in earnest now , under his armpits , around his back , in his crotch . Lein slapped at a mosquito . His palm smacked against his cheek . " Critters'Il eat a man alive , " he said . " They do n't bother me , " said Morgan proudly . " They just ai n't seen you yet , " said his father . A few moments later , Morgan heard a buzzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but missed . A second later , a mosquito was rawing blood from the welt . Later , the two stopped their bug hunt , having scratched emselves raw and slapped their faces long enough . " I do n't like it here , none , " said Lem softly . " Why , Pa ? " Du n no . Just a feelin ' . " " Feels kinda closed in , " said Morgan . " This close to the river ai n't good . " le was remembering the storm , thought Morgan . He could . ar the river now , almost like a whisper underneath the other p 70 sounds . It sounded far away , but he could imagine it in his mind , see its forbidding muddy waters swirling past the cottonwoods , nibbling at the banks , moving earth , turning it to . silt and sand . It was a powerful feeling he had about that river . It meant a journey to him , but it also meant adventure and danger . The river was everything and it was not tame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done to the keelboats . " Best turn in , " said Lem , sighing . " I reckon , " said Morgan , but he sat there for sever moments until he heard his father 's soft snores . Then , he lay o his bedroll , found the right position , closed his eyes . The night sounds soothed Morgan to sleep . Later , he was awakened roughly , and he thought he w dying . Morgan felt a hand over his mouth , smothering him . He struggled to rise , but powerful hands pinned him down . He smelled the foul breath of a man as he leaned down in the darkness . " Do n't make a sound , son . I come as friend . " Morgan whipsawed furiously , trying to break free . " Be quiet or you might be dead , " said the voice . He rec ognized it as belonging to the trapper they had met downriver : Patch . " Here 's your sack of possibles . I 've got you rifle . " Morgan stopped struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick . Just foller me , " said Patch , taking his hand away from Morgan 's mouth . " Where 's my pa ? " whispered the young man . " With Loonie . Come on , follow me . " " I do n't " " Shh ! " said Patch . " Where 's my horse ? " Morgan whispered as Patch guided him through the darkness .  | " Taken care of . Do n't talk no more . " Puzzled , Morgan allowed himself to be pushed along blind . is mind was still foggy from sleep and he wondered where Itch was taking him . Morgan stumbled and Patch had to pull on the youth 's arm to p him from falling . Morgan knew they were climbing up bluff Patch shoved Morgan down behind an outcropping of rock hl handed him his rifle . " You set real still , young ' un . If your teeth get to chatterin ' , you bite down on a stick . No noise . " Morgan nodded . He shivered , but he knew it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patch 's moccasins and then it was still . He knew the trapper had gone back down the spine of bluff . But why ? It was quiet for a few moments . Then , Morgan heard a moccasin scrape on stone . Something rustled in the brush down below , where the trappers were camped . Gradually , Morgan 's eyes adjusted to the darkness . Clouds hid the moon and stars , but there was enough light that he wild distinguish shapes . He could not tell what the shapes were ; he could only guess . The night changed everything , and was always fascinated by it . At times , back in Kentucky , when he was in the woods late , he would watch the shadows take shape and try to guess what they were . Or , when he went to the woods early in the morning , when it was still dark , he would mark each shape . Often , they resembled the heads or bodies of animals . Then , in the light , he would see that they were only trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made no sound as he looked around . He thought he ight be alone , but he heard someone breathing a few feet away . The silence took on an eerie aspect . He wished whoever s there would say something . Anything . He felt as if he was p 72 being watched . But he could n't see anyone 's eyes . He couldnt even see a face in the pitch-black hood of night that pressed him now with a slow , suffocating terror . Morgan slid his right hand down his side , searching for knife . He touched the handle , then something moved close him and he felt iron-hard fingers close around his wrist . Ili heart bumped as it skipped beats and his throat froze with s terrible lump that had not been there before . He felt a man 's hot breath on his face and then a ha clamped over his mouth . He felt himself being pushed bas ward , toward the edge of the bluff . He wanted to fight back , kick his attacker , but the man straddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to free himself from the grasp of whoever hold of him , but the man only increased the pressure . Morgan could n't see who it was , but he knew that in another few seconds he would be shoved over the bluff to fall to death far below in the empty , mindless dark .  | Morgan heard footsteps crunching softly on the loose stones op the bluff He heard a branch brush against a deerskin gging . " Leave him be , Loonie , " said Patch softly . Suddenly , Morgan felt a release of pressure over his mouth the Indian took his hand away . He felt himself being pulled roughly away from the edge of the precipice back to a sitting position . " I told you not to move , kid . " " Damn you , Patch , " growled Morgan . " If your nigger ever aches me again , I 'll gut him . " I le knew Patch was laughing because there was a change in man 's breathing , but the laugh was n't out loud . He saw two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that both them were probably laughing at him . p 74 Patch knelt down next to the boy . " Looky yonder , " he whispered into Morgan 's ear . He felt a hand at the back of his head . Patch turned the boy ' head to the east . " What is it ? " Morgan asked , his voice barely audible . He saw flames dancing in the darkness . On the river , or near it . " Torches , " said Patch in his ear . " Them coons was comin ' to grab you up and take you back to MacDougal . " " How come ? " " ' Cause the Major 's got forty kinds of bat in his belfry ' that 's how come . He wanted them niggers to cotch Jocko , t ( and drag him back . " " I do n't understand . " " MacDougal do n't have all his hinges in place , son . Now , you just set and keep your flap shut . " Morgan watched the torches disappear and reappear through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had felt odd before he was deeply bewildered now . It was as if he was not reall there , sort of dreaming . He felt as if he was watching something strange and evil and was powerless to do anythin about it . " Where 's my pa ? " he asked . " I got him in a tree . Jocko 's in another . You just sit tight , so You be quiet as a dead beaver or I 'll put the butt of my rifle your skull and put you to sleep . " It was quiet for a long time after that , except for the incessant sawing of mosquitoes . Morgan watched the torches until his eyes burned in their sockets . Then , they winked out . He thought the men might have dowsed them in the river , but he heard no hissing sound . The only sound was in his m and it would n't go away .  | Lem listened harder than he had ever listened before , trying to shut out the whine of a mosquito in his ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what they meant . Patch had n't told him much , only that some men from the Major 's brigade were coming to do them harm . He sat in the crotch of a cottonwood tree , a portion of his butt dead and bloodless . He did n't dare move , though he felt the sting of a mosquito 's needle on his cheek . He could not see Jocko DeSam , but he knew that he was sitting up in another tree like a raccoon , not twenty yards away . It was so quiet for such a long time that Lem thought he was no longer breathing . That everything in the world had disappeared or come to a halt . Then , he heard it . The soft rustle of moccasins on the grasses , the quiet rasp of ' skins brushing against bushes , the faint tink of rustled leaves . The noises stopped . Then , he heard a low whisper . He scanned the ground below , thought he saw someone skulking toward his bedroll . A second later , he saw shadowy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rifle to his shoulder , careful to make no sound . As the shadow bent down , he drew a bead from memory , for he could not see his sights in the darkness . Suddenly , without warning , Lem got the shakes . He had n't had those since he was a boy , the first time he saw a buck in his iron sights . And he had n't had them since . But he had them now . He could n't find a target , did n't know whether he was shooting a bear or a man . Sweat beaded up in his brows , dripped downward , stinging his eyes . Then , the night exploded with bright orange blossoms and the thunder of big bore rifles . Lem heard the deadly whisper of flints striking steel , the low whoosh of powder igniting in the p 76 pan . The camp lit up with dark shapes as men scurried out of the crossfire . The leaves rattled in the trees , lead balls thunked into limestone and burnt bark from cottonwood trunks . Lein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving his retinas glowing with fiery sparks . Lem heard men shouting , running . " Goddamnit , " he muttered . Stuck in the tree . Helpless as a pig on an iced pond . " Get the hell down out of that tree , Hawke , " yelled Dick Hauser . " By gar , they get away . " Jocko 's voice . Lem listened to the crash of men running through brush , the crackle of small limbs , the thrash of leaves . Rocks rattled down from the bluff and the dank breath of limestone assailed his nostrils , mixing with the heady scent of the mud and sandladen river swirling past banks thick with vegetation clinging to fragile moorings . Hawke dropped from the tree , bent his knees to absorb the shock . He gripped his rifle tightly , rocked back on his heels until he regained his balance . On the ground , he could see even less . The noises were drifting away . He stood there , not knowing what to do , wondering if he 'd knocked all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree . " Hawke , come on , " said a voice . " Who 's that ? " " Hauser . " Lem felt a hand touch his elbow . " Dick ? Where we goin ' ? " " After them bushwhackers . " " Hell , I ca n't see a thing . " " Foller me . " Dick stepped into the darkness and Lem had to jump after  | him to keep up . He followed Hauser more by sound than sight , but knew they were heading toward the river . Ahead , they heard shouts and the sharp crack of a rifle . Blindly , Lem raced after Dick Hauser . Sapling limbs slashed at his face , brush tugged at his leggings . He tripped , cursed silently . His breath burned hot in his chest and he gulped in air as the pace quickened . He wondered how Dick knew where to go in the darkness . Then , he saw dark sky , the silhouettes of trees growing along the river . A few moments later , Hauser stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in low , gruff tones . Then there was another rifle shot , followed , in quick succession , by two more . Bright flashes of orange light sprouted from barrels downriver . " H000waaay ! " shouted Jocko DeSam . " Come on , " said Hauser . " It looks like they got ' em . " " Who in hell are they ? " " Damned if I know . Thieves . Scundrels . " Dick walked downriver , Lem right behind him , holding his rifle at the ready . Nat Sullard and Pappy Roth stood looking down at the ground . Jocko was on his knees , turning over one of the men he had shot . There were three men stretched out , their chests soaked with blood . One had been shot in the groin as well . Lem 's breathing settled down and the fire in his chest subsided . His nostrils filled with the smell of dank river water and death . " One got away , " said Jocko , standing up . He stood his rifle on its butt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muzzle . " Goddamn dark . Ca n't see no goddamn thing . " He poured powder down his muzzle , going by instinct and feel . Then , he pulled a strip of patching from his possibles pouch . He stretched the cloth across the muzzle , fished a ball  | from his pouch and centered it , thumbed it down the barrel until it was flush . Grabbing his patch knife , he cut the excess patch away . With his wiping stick , he eased the ball six inches down the barrel , then rammed it home atop the ninety or one hundred grains of powder he figured he 'd poured . He seated the ball , then primed his pan , blowing away the excess powder , shoved down the frizzen plate over the pan . " Dick , strike us some light , " said Nat Sullard . " Let 's see who we got here . " Hauser stepped away from the bunch and knelt down . Lem heard the clatter of a tin box , the rattle of flint and steel . Dick scratched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few moments later , he had a small fire . Jocko tore cattails from the river , set them afire . He swung the torches over the faces of the dead men . " Know ' em ? " asked Lem . " That one , he 's Lucien LeBoef , " said Jocko with solemnity . He kicked the corpse in the side , muttering " Merde . " " This ' uns Dave Trask , " said Nat , pointing to the middle man . " And that other'n , he be Ernie Parsons , " said Dick Hauser . " War n't none of ' em no account . " Lem sucked in a breath . The men looked like lifeless husks , their faces gaunt in the fireglow , the eyes vacant , the skin pallid as if the blood had drained out of their heads . He felt queasy . Jocko DeSam looked over at Hawke , muttered something to Nat Sullard . Nat spoke to the others . Lem heard them stripping the dead men of their possibles pouches , moccasins , knives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a splash and turned around . He started toward the men coming after the second body , when Jocko stopped him and braced him by the shoulders .  | " What in hell are you doin ' ? " asked Lem . " That be as good a-buryin ' as they deserve , eh , mon ami ? " " Goddamnit , Jocko , you just killed three men . Why ? " " Ah , it is a long , long story , eh ? " " Well , maybe you better start explainin ' . " " Ah , oui , maybe so , it is a good time to talk of this and of other things . Come , we find Patch and Loonie and your boy . We hold the pow-wow , non ? " There were two more splashes and Lem shook his head . " There was another man , Jocko . I seen him , " said Sullard . " Yes , he is not here . Patch told me it was Fletch . " " Who 's Fletch ? " asked Lem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A damned snake , that one . I shoulda figgered this was his handiwork , skulkin ' up to our camp in the dark , sneakin ' up on us . " " I just do n't know if I want anymore of this , " said Lem . " All this killin ' , this treachery . " " Ah , mon ami , this is nothing , " said Jocko . " These men were the vermin , eh ? They kill plenty men before they get the number come up , non ? This MacDougal , he give Jocko the double cross and now he want to rub me out , put the grass in my mouth . " Lem did n't understand what Jocko was saying , but it was something to hold on to while he tried to settle his senses . He could not get the images of the dead men 's faces out of his mind , and he thought of the man Morgan had killed and wondered if he was not bringing his boy into a worse world than they left back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hauser . " We will light the fire and make the big pow-wow . We will smoke the pipe and make the talk , eh ? Maybe we burn the woodtick , is it not ? Come , Hawke , you listen to Jocko DeSam , eh ? He tell you  | plenty . " Jocko scraped a tick from the back of his hand , pinched it deftly between thumb and forefinger until blood oozed from its flattened body . Jocko tugged on Lem 's sleeve . They followed the torch back to the disrupted camp through the eerie shadows it cast , single-file , like men going to the gallows , silently , each with his own thoughts about the night 's foul work . Morgan followed Patch and the Delaware down the bluff . His brain was teeming with questions , but he was having too much trouble with his footing . The Indian and the trapper made no sounds with their moccasins , but Morgan kicked stones loose and he felt as if the bluff might slide out from under him and pitch him into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose up and enveloped Morgan 's face . He swatted blindly in front of his face to keep from breathing them in . He heard the other men coming back to the camp , their voices low-pitched , throaty with manly rumbles . Patch and Loonie disappeared in the shadows of the bluff , leaving Morgan alone by his bedroll . " Hallo the camp , " called Hauser . " We'uns be here , " answered Patch . Moments later , the band of men stalked into view , single-file shadows carrying rifles . " Dick , make us the little fire , eh ? " said Jocko . " The smoke she will make the mosquitoes go back to the river . Nat , you keep the eye out , non ? " " I reckon I kin , " said Sullard . Morgan slunk over to his father , whispered a question into his ear . " What happened , Pa ? " p 81 " I 'll tell you later , " Lem said quickly . Hauser soon had a small fire ablaze . The light flickered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards away , behind an Osage orange tree , his rifle nestled between a fork in the limbs , pointed toward the river . " Why would that damned Scotsman send those killers after us ? " asked Lem , looking directly at DeSam . " Ah , it is the politics , " said Jocko . " It is the goddamn fur , non ? Eh , these company , they kill for what they want . " " We do n't work for no company , " said Morgan , feeling his father 's anger , sensing that his pa was all by himself , that something had changed between him and the other men . " We ai n't done nothin ' to them . " " That 's right , " said Lem . " Was it you they was after , Jocko ? " " Eh , mebbe so , " said DeSam , shrugging . He waved a hand through an antic scrim of mosquitoes . The other men slapped their faces at random , scratched at woodticks crawling into their moccasins . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan . Young Hawke 's expression of consternation showed his puzzlement . His eyebrows knitted in a sudden scowl and he blinked like a barn owl . " Me ? " Morgan asked . " You tell him , Patch , eh ? " said Jocko . Patch walked over to the fringe of the glow thrown by the fire , hunkered down on his haunches . His hand slid down his rifle barrel and stopped at the brass trigger guard . " The Major , he 's got him some conscripts , " said the grizzled old trapper . " Young ' uns he totes up to the mountains . He buys ' em , trades for ' ern , do n't pay ' em much er nothin " tall . I reckon he had his eye on your boy all right . " " You mean he wanted to steal Morgan ? " asked Lemuel. p 82 " Likely he would n't call it stealin ' , more like teachin ' . Slavery 's what I calls it . Cheap labor . He 's cheated more'n one lad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Morgan swallowed an imaginary lump in his throat . He looked at his father . " Well , he better stay away from my boy , " said Lem . " He even looks at Morg cross-eyed , I 'll lay him out cold . " " I think we meet the Major again , " said Jocko . " I think he work for that bastard Astor . " " Time was you was askin ' me to hook up with him , " said Lem . " I did not know him so well , eh ? " replied DeSam . " I worked for him , I see him cheat the trappers . So , I cheat him . " " He do n't like Frenchy none , " said Patch , referring to Jocko . " The Major do n't like nobody much , " said Hauser . " I worked for him a season , too . " " What is this about Astor ? " asked Lem . " Who 's Astor ? " " Ah , he plenty rich man , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think this Major he work for American Fur . " " And who do you work for ? " asked Lem . Jocko did not answer right away . Sullard and Hauser looked at Lem , shook their heads , as if telling Hawke that he had gone too far . Patch stared at Jocko as if demanding an answer . DeSam heaved a sigh , shrugged . " It is late , " said the Frenchman . " I will take the first watch . " To Lem Hawke , he said privately , " Do not worry yourself over these little politics , eh ? You trap the beaver and let Jocko take care of the business , my friend . You and your son will make fine trappers , eh ? " " Are you asking me to work for you ? " " Well , do you have the license ? " p 83 " Yes . I got a license from Missouri Fur . " " Ah , then , do not worry . You trap , you work . Jocko will see that you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , winked at Morgan . He walked over to the fire and kicked dirt and rocks on it to put it out . The men wandered off to their bedrolls . Patch and Loonie disappeared into the darkness . " Pa ? " Morgan called from his bedroll . " What ? " " Do you like Jocko ? " " I du n no , " said Lem . " Makes no nevermind . " " How come ? " " We mean to go trappin ' anyways we can . Jocko knows the way . He can learn us how to do it . " " He might cheat you . " " He might , " admitted Lem . " But he 'd only do it once . " " Then what ? " " He would n't do it no more . " " How come ? " " He 'd be dead or cripped up so bad he would n't want to do it no more . " " Maybe we should go back home , " said Morgan , his voice lazy with sleepiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , son . This is home . Wherever we be is home . " " It do n't feel much like home . " " I know , " said Lem . " Get some sleep , son . Hard as this day was , tomorrow 's bound to be harder . " " Good night , Pa . " " Good night , Morg . " Morgan looked up at the pulsing silver stars . Mosquitoes buzzed around his head . He felt a tick burrowing in his leg . He  | was too tired to scratch it . The buzzing lulled him to sleep as soundly as if he had been drugged . He saw dead men in his dreams . One had the face of the man he had killed during the storm . Then the face changed and became the Major 's . And the face was laughing .  | The Missouri River still boiled , its writhing waters a yellowish brown , contrasting sharply with the slate-gray seethe of the Mississippi . Fletcher Bancroft and another trapper tugged on the boat hook . The body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught on a davit . Fletcher jerked the pole attached to the hook and Trask 's remains landed on deck with a thud . The river rats had gotten to Trask 's face , had dug out the eyes and eaten into the sockets . Part of his nose was chewed away . Major MacDougal joined the group of men looking at the waterlogged body of the dead trapper . " I told you to take care of this yourself , Fletch , " said McDougal , stepping close to whisper in the trapper 's ear . " They had us outnumbered , Major . " Fletch dragged the body away from the gunwale and spread the linsey-woolsey shirt .  | " Square in the breadbasket , " he said , pointing to the hole in the dead man 's stomach . A man stepped up close to the Major . He had swarthy skin , eyes black as raw coffee beans and a thin scar bleeding away from one eye as if a large tear had left a track . His lips had been mashed by countless fists and heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others carious . Jose Montez w . s dressed more like a sailor than a trapper , but he had been both . MacDougal nodded to the Spaniard , his eyes as cold as cave rocks . " That one of ' em you sent after Jocko ? " asked Montez . The Major nodded . " You sure that Hawke sumbitch was with DeSam ? " " And his whelp , " said the Major . " I swear I 'll have all their hides stretched on willow withes before I 'm finished with this expedition . " " Them Hawkes is mine , " said the Spaniard . " Montez , you have all the hair you want of the pap , but that boy looked to be prime goods . He did n't have a hand in killing your brother , anyway . " " He 's a nit from a louse , " said Montez . He looked at the bank as the keelboat slipped past , guided by men poling the boat , two on the rudder . Ahead , other men kept the horse herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped in the breeze , its long cordelle dangling like a tree snake from the masthead to the deck . Another boat followed , its goods stacked amidships in a long boxlike structure , lashed down tight , forty-odd men aboard . Montez had ridden up the evening before , just as the men in the Major 's brigade were loading the two keelboats . The men had pulled into the landing stages that same morning , early , cursing in the dark , shadowy figures in the p 87 swirling fog . Montez had gotten aboard the lead boat in time to help cast off the lines and set his shoulder to a pole . Then , one of the trappers had spotted the body of Trask , bobbing next to the bank , a leg caught by an exposed cottonwood root . Montez puffed on a thin cheroot , his eyes glittering with the feral brilliance of a man who started every day with a shot of gut-wrenching whiskey . His small-billed seaman 's cap sat atop a shock of thick , black curly hair . His loose homespun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his chest , coiled tangles that looked like wire springs . His hands were rough , the joints knotty , the fingers gnarled as twisted manzanita roots . Buckskin trousers , smoked over greasy campfires , snugged tight against his lean hips . He carried a Spanish flintlock tucked in his bright red sash ; a large knife hung from a wide belt with an ornate brass buckle . By then , everyone aboard the keelboats knew that Montez was the brother of Spanish Jack and that Lem Hawke had been responsible for burning down the tavern in St. Louis . Spanish Jack had n't made it out and had ended up ash and bone . His daughter , Willa , had told her uncle the whole story when Montez arrived from New Orleans . Now , Montez wanted revenge for his brother 's murder , for that 's how he figured it . He meant to rub out Lem Hawke at first sight . The Major had known both Montez and Spanish Jack . Like everyone else , he knew the story of the fire at Spanish Jack 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for seducing Morgan , had started a fight in Willa 's bedroom . During the brawl , Lem had either knocked over or thrown a lamp . The fire had spread quickly . Jack 's daughter , Morgan and Lem had gotten out , along with all the patrons downstairs in the saloon , but Spanish Jack had perished in the flames . Willa told the story that Lem had knocked her father out cold and had deliberately set fire to Spanish Jack's.  | " Fletch , throw that corpse back in the river , " ordered MacDougal . " Big ' Un , get ' em movin ' . " Big Mike Finnegan , patroon of the two keelboats , stood atop a large cargo box and yelled lustily : " You thar . Set poles for the mountains . " His clean-shaven head , his enormous girth and thick neck gave him the look of a hydrocephalic mushroom . Josie tossed his cheroot over the side just as Trask 's body splashed back into the river . He grabbed an oar and joined Fletch and four other oarsmen forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , braced for the first thrust . Forward , twenty polemen poised to port , preparing to shove off with their long , iron-clad poles . Mike swung the helm with one mighty arm , lifted the hunting horn hanging from a thong lacing his chest and put the mouthpiece to his lips . He blew the signal to start , a throaty mellifluous moan that increased in pitch and ended up in a vibrant tremolo that hung in the air like thick fog . The six oarsmen dipped their oars in unison . The polemen , facing the stern of the keelboat , slid their poles into the murky water , set them against the river bottom , threw the muscle and sinew of their shoulders against the curved sockets at the tip of the poles . They heaved , shoving the boat away from shore and upstream against the current . They slogged their way , in single file , toward the stern . Mike began singing a sea chanty and the polesmen picked up the melody . When they reached the stern , the patroon yelled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raced back to the bow , rammed their poles back to the bottom again and once more braced themselves against the sockets and pushed . The boats slid upstream , lumbering against the tug of the current . Major MacDougal stood by the cabin watching the men strain against the Missouri . His face bore no expression , but he p 89 looked at the eyes of the young men with the poles as they lunged aft and his eyes glittered like coals fanned by a whispering wind . They were strong young men , most coming back for their second season of trapping . On the western shore , the men with the horses and mules paced themselves , letting the animals graze and drink along the shore . Some of the men looked at the sky , dreading the next spring storm . Others rode off , singly and in pairs , to seek game for the brigade . MacDougal nodded silently in satisfaction as the keelboats gained headway . They were headed for the mountains , and among the men in his brigade , with its many internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served as his eyes and ears . None but he knew who they were . He suspected that Jocko DeSam would prove a problem later on . Those who had gone with him were of the same ilk , not to be trusted . In the fur trade , the Major knew , beaver were not the only animals that must be skinned ; competitors , be they few or several , were fair game . He now considered Jocko , Patch and his crazy Indian , the Hawkes , and the others who had ridden off with the Frenchmen to be competitors , possibly spies for a rival fur company . He looked down at Josie Montez , now just another oarsman earning his keep . That one could prove useful , MacDougal thought . Montez wanted to kill Lemuel Hawke . Perhaps he would consider killing the others who followed Jocko DeSam . As the work got harder , the men stopped singing , but Big ' Un kept up a steady chant as he steered the keelboat upriver , guiding the helm with one hand , swatting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , boys , " sang Mike . " Bear a hand there , Paddy . Let 's see your neck bow , Harold me boy . "  | The unwieldy keelboat , a hundred feet long and twenty feet wide , gained headway mainly through the efforts of the voyageurs . With their necks bowed , their heads nearly touching the track of the running board , they pushed with all their might to the stern . They followed the patroon 's commands to return to the bow for each new " set . " With its shallow draft , the keelboat did well on such a river as the Missouri . When the boat gained deeper water , the oarsmen took over the work of propelling the boat upriver and the sweat-soaked voyageurs could relax for awhile as they watched for treacherous snags , sandbars , floating trees . When they were well underway , Big ' Un ordered Fletch to set sail and they caught the wind and the men rested as the boat cleaved through rushing muddy waters , listening as the occasional thud of a log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hull . The mast stood a third of the way down from the bow and the sail was a tall square piece of heavy cloth . There were not many stretches on the Missouri where the sail could be used , since the river writhed like a giant snake through bluff-dominated prairie and there was often a terrible surprise waiting at each dramatic bend . And MacDougal , setting the glass to his eye , scanned the horizon beyond both banks and looked ahead for any sign of Jocko DeSam 's renegade party . He wondered if they would try to go to the Rockies by river or travel overland , out of sight , but not out of his raging , vindictive mind . Morgan Hawke was glad that they had left the river and were riding well away from the clouds of mosquitoes that had plagued them ever since breaking camp that morning . Morgan could see the trees that marked the river 's banks , the way they  | twisted through the stark , beautiful land , with its high bluffs like castle fortresses . Beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently in the morning breeze that was fanned by the heat from the rising sun . Jocko had decided , for all of them , that it would be better if they did not try and find a keelboat ahead to take them on . Instead , he said they would follow the river at a distance until they reached one he called the Platte . " There 's a man keeps lookin ' over his shoulder , " Lem told his son later that day . " I noticed it , " said Morgan softly . He and his father rode alone , following well behind Jocko , Loonie and Hauser . They had been delegated to handle the spare horses and pack mules . Jocko had said they would all take turns . Patch was well ahead of the party , followed by Nat Sullard . Pappy Roth had gone off hunting . " Seems like he done changed his mind oftener'n his shirt . " " You mean about the Major ? " " Him and a lot of things . " Morgan wondered what his father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; slow to speak , but when he did say something it was more like a riddle than fact . " Where are we going , Pa ? I mean did Jocko say ? " " Some river . " " He knows this country then . " " I reckon . " " How come Patch is ridin ' so far ahead ? " " Figgers to see we do n't get no big surprises . " " Indians ? " " Maybe . Nat tolt me this was all Injun country , but big enough so 's you might never see ' em . " " I hope we see some . " p 92 " Son , you do n't want to flap your mouth like that . Injuns , from all I hear , is trouble . All of ' em 's pure mean , ' cordin ' to Hauser and Sullard . " " You talked to them ' bout it ? " " This mornin ' whilst you was packin ' up . " They heard the sharp crack of a rifle far off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence for a few moments . The wide game trail they followed was trackless after the rains . To the north , the sky was more black than gray and the air seemed laden with moisture . The sun , wherever it was , sent a heavy sweaty heat down on them . " I 'll go see if he needs help , " said Lem . " You stay put . " Lem rode off , leaving Morgan to follow Jocko and the others on a march that roughly followed the river . Boots kept nipping at the rump of one of the mules . Morgan finally got tired of it and slapped his horse 's neck . Boots ' ears went flat for a moment and he shook his head . The mule brayed as if he was the one who had taken the blow . The country was strange to Morgan , so unlike any he had ever seen . Missing were the vast forests of Kentucky and Tennessee , replaced by tall trees wrapped in wild grapevines . When he glimpsed the banks of the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too thick to walk or ride through , and he avoided those places , swinging wide with the pack animals to avoid the fallen trees , huge giants that blocked his path . He looked in amazement at a place where several trees had fallen on top of one another . They were overgrown with shoulder-high nettles . He rode too close , once , and the nettles struck at him , stinging his wrists , burning into his skin like the sharp cuts of a whip . He got tangled in the climbing roses and buckthorn , and vowed never again to ride or walk anywhere near such dangerous plant life . Boots began to buck with the p 93 gouge of thorns before horse and rider were free of it . Morgan was covered with ticks , and though he brushed off those he could see , others burrowed into his flesh . Mosquitoes , swarming from fetid ponds created by the flood waters , found him , covered him with burning welts . A buck deer , flashing a white tail like a flag , burst from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those ahead . Instead , he was caught up with the beauty and grace of the buck as it bounded through places too thick for a rabbit to hop and disappeared into a swallowing darkness of thicket and vine . I le heard the faroff crack of a rifle and wondered if his father had found game . Perhaps his pa had seen the big buck with its fourteen-point rack , but the buck had not gone that way . Morgan found the image of the deer lingering in his mind and he wondered then why he heard no birds calling . Suddenly , a wave of lonesomeness swept over him like a silent tide and he felt alone and friendless , fatherless as well . " Then , Morgan heard the distant hammering of a woodpecker and thought of the forests of his boyhood in Kentucky . Sometime during the afternoon , when still he had heard no birdsong , Morgan was surprised by a loud screeching . Ahead , he saw hundreds of what he took to be flying leaves , all flittering from branches like butterflies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild parakeets startled by the riders ahead , dozens of them , flying erratically through the tall trees like leaves before the wind . As he watched the green birds dart from tree to tree , creating the worst racket he 'd ever heard , Morgan lost sight of the horses and mules . Moments later , he realized the animals had gotten ahead of him . He put moccasin heels to Boots ' flanks , rode two hundred yards around a bend in the treeline . The herd was not there . p 94 The other riders were nowhere in sight , either . Panic rose in Morgan 's throat , squeezed it tight . He felt a sense of suffocation . He stood up in the stirrups , trying to see far enough ahead to spot the others , or the animals in his care . It seemed suddenly quiet , with only the sound of his heartbeat thrumming in his ears . Dark clouds were moving in and Morgan felt a soft spray of rain against his face . The parakeets stopped their raucous screaming now that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ear , a whisper from the northwest , not yet heavy but freshening , cooling . Morgan wanted to call out , but the stillness , the emptiness of the land seemed too forbidding . He saw the swath through the grasses where the horses and mules had gone and kicked Boots again to hurry him along . He felt a pang of embarrassment that he had let the herd get away from him . He did not want the others to know that he had neglected his duty . On he rode , the anxiety in him increasing with each moment . He looked at the darkening sky , watched the clouds float like silent barges until they shrouded the sun . The trail petered out , as if the herd had scattered . There was no single swath any longer , but tendrils of paths recently trod , fanning out in bewildering directions as if someone had scattered the animals . The panic in him changed to fear . He clutched his flintlock , realized he had unconsciously folded his hand over the pan after the first kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a blackbird 's wing quill that fit the touchhole . He stuck it in the hole , kept his hand over the pan . He looked down , saw the fine patina of powder lining the tiny bowl and felt its dryness . I le looked toward the hidden river , the tall trees . If the horses or mules got into that , well , he would n't know how to get them out . p 95 Morgan followed a single trail and then he lost it . He stopped Boots and drew in the first deep breath he 'd taken since losing sight of the pack animals . His throat went dry . He heard the rain begin to spatter and Boots began to sway his head in annoyance as heavy drops stung his eyes . Morgan felt the darkness closing in on him . Ahead , he saw the distant horizon flash with lightning and seconds later heard the thundercrack booming like a cannon shot . The wind stiffened , but it was a warm wind and heavy now with moisture . Morgan went on , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed his way . Another staggered flash of light in the sky and the thunder boomed closer , warning of danger . Five minutes later , the rain burst over him like a waterfall and he could no longer see the trees . It was a steady , soaking rain , blinding , wind-driven , blotting out the land , driving it away from his eyes until he knew he was all alone , lost and caught in the open where the lightning could fry him like a moth caught in flame . Morgan felt suddenly , strangely , calm . He turned Boots to the right , toward the river , seeking shelter from the storm that broke over him with a vengeance . The fear was gone , but the loneliness , like a smothering blanket , left an ache in his chest as if his lungs had been singed . He wondered if his pa even knew that he was lost . Morgan slackened the reins , gave Boots his head . " Find us a place , Boots , " he said , patting the horse 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan , wilted the blackbird 's quill in his touchhole until it drooped limp as a rag . But Boots turned away from the river and Morgan heard it roar like a maddened beast as the raging water collapsed banks p 96 and snatched trees from the shore , snapped them like string beans and gobbled them into its maw . There seemed , just then , no safe place to go as lightning streaked the sky with silver lace and thunder cracked so close Morgan jumped inside his sodden buckskins . And the horse stopped dead in its tracks , lost and blinded by the surging , pelting rain . 97 Morgan realized why Boots had balked at going on . The horse had probably saved his life . Flooding waters roared through a deep gash in the land a few yards ahead . It seemed as if the river had changed course , gone wild , lashing angrily at everything in its path along an old dry wash . The flash flood cut a swath twenty feet wide , four or five feet deep , tearing chunks out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streambed . He heard , above the din , the scream of horses , the hysterical braying of mules , the shouts of men like ragged pennants of sound flapping and fading in the angry lash of the rain . The sounds were eerie , almost unearthly . So , too , the din of the boiling torrent that devoured the land as it rushed toward the big river . Morgan rocked backward in the saddle , the fear in him suddenly palpable , an iron thing so cold he could taste it in his  | mouth , so hard he could feel it pressing against his senses , numbing them like whiskey hot in the veins . He knew that if he stayed there , the flood waters would take the ground from beneath him , snatch him up like a rag doll and hurl him to a watery death , bury him in a grave no one would ever find . Turning Boots , Morgan felt the ground pull away from the horse 's hooves . Currents he could not see , burrowing under the earth , were nibbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Boots ; The horse moved as Morgan tugged on the reins . His eyes swept the terrain , squinted against the pelt of rain . He reined the horse in a tight circle , clapped moccasined heels to the animal 's flanks . With the roaring of the floodwaters in his ears , Morgan sought high ground , knowing there was little likelihood he 'd find any the horse could climb . The only high ground he 'd seen had been steep bluffs bordering the river . Beyond those , the land was as flat as a pine board . As he rode away from the flooded creek , Morgan saw someone waving to him . Just a shadow with the shape of a man , but enough to catch his attention . Turning Boots , Morgan guided the horse to the solitary figure . The man was afoot , stranded on a tiny island amid raging waters . " Ho , boy . Help ! " The man calling to Morgan was Nat Sullard . His face was streaked with mud , his buckskins torn and sodden . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . Morgan felt Boots fighting the bit as he drew closer . Then , the horse stopped . Another outlaw creek had formed , bursting through a new channel , slashing a separate course from the other , winding  | toward lower ground . Nat Sullard stood alone between two floods , horseless . All around him water surged , ravishing deep passages in the plain . " II ca n't get no closer , " shouted Morgan . " Look at it . It 's ever'where . " " You got a rope ? " " Nope . " " Come on , Morg . We did n't mean nothin ' . We was just jokin ' . " " Huh ? What 're you talkin ' about , Mister Sullard ? " " Just funnin ' ye . Now , come on now . It 's real important . " Nat 's voice quavered with fear . Morgan could sense the man trembling , shaking inside . Nat seemed to have lost his reason . " I do n't have no rope . This horse wo n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Morgan . Your pa would want you to . " " Where is my pa ? " " I do n't know . That water come down on us ' thout no warnin ' , God . Drownded , maybe . Morgan , you got to get me outta here . " " If you can get acrost that one stretch , " said Morgan , " I can help you . Give you a ride out of here . " " Hell , I ca n't swim , Morgan . " " Me neither . " " Dammit , boy , this ai n't no time to be holdin ' grudges . " " I do n't know what you mean , Mister Sullard . " " Oh , shit , " said Nat . " Where 's your horse ? Maybe I could go and fetch it . " " Swept off when it hit . Damn , boy , you goin ' to come get me ? " Nat 's voice rose to a hysterical pitch . As Morgan watched helplessly , Nat Sullard looked all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to shrink . The lone trapper began to blur before Morgan 's eyes as  | the rain fell harder than before . Wind-driven , the downpour lashed at Morgan 's face , stung his eyes . " Jesus , " said Sullard . " Maybe it ai n't as deep as it looks , " said Morgan , but he knew that was a lie . The water was deep and getting deeper . In another minute or two , he would have to ride away or the flash flood would sweep him up in its grasp . " You want to try and jump it , maybe grasp the stock of my rifle . " " Too danged fur , " said Sullard . " Where 's everybody else did you say ? " " Scattered ever ' whichaway , " said Nat . " Hell , boy , we did n't mean nothin ' . We was just a-pullin ' yore leg . " Morgan had no idea what Sullard was jabbering about . He wondered if Nat blamed him for his predicament . The man sounded plumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a sound that sent spiders scurrying down the nape of his neck . Just then , the waters surged and widened . A sudden rolling tide rushed toward the hapless Sullard . Like a battering wall , a two-foot-high wave careened from a point behind him , seeming to come from nowhere as if a giant had thrown out a bucket of water . " Look out ! " called Morgan . Sullard yelled something , but Morgan could n't hear him above the roar of water . He held on to the saddle horn as Boots turned , began to gallop away through the sheeting rain . " Whoa boy , " said Morgan , hauling in hard on the reins . Morgan saw the wall of water hit Nat in the back of his knees , pitch him forward into the swirling maelstrom . There was a terrible force in the water , an energy that belied its small size . The way it hit Sullard , cut him off at the knees , told young Hawke that . That small wave was more powerful than a span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw Nat flailing his arms , helpless against the surge of the flood . He wondered if Boots would be able to swim the swollen , surging wild creek . He slapped the horse 's rump and withers with the reins , dug his heels into its flanks . Boots kicked and sidled , but he would not go near the flooding waters . Morgan knew that if he threw himself into the rampaging waters , both he and Nat would go under . Helplessly , Morgan stopped beating the reluctant horse . He turned in the saddle , saw Nat swept away , farther and farther from where the island had been until he disappeared where the twin creeks converged once again . Morgan 's senses were jumbled , spun with fragments of distorted sensation , as if something was snatching at his mind , clawing all his thoughts to shreds . Seeing a man go like that , down and under and away . . . a terrible thing . Morgan felt helpless , small , powerless , as if he was anchored in stone . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that someone was watching him . Maybe God . God or someone was watching him . He looked around , tried to look up into the rain , but the water blinded him . He tried to shake off the spooky feeling , tried to erase the image of Nat Sullard 's arms flailing against the force that plunged him to his death . It was hard to breathe as he thought about Nat trying to suck in air and getting only lungfuls of water . " II 'm sorry , Nat , " he whispered , and then felt ashamed that he had said such a thing . To no one . No , he had the curious feeling that someone had heard him . Boots galloped to the west , away from the boiling , rampaging waters . Morgan gave him his head . Maybe the horse knew a safe place to go . Morgan let the rain wash away his tears , slumped in the p 102 saddle , broken by the death he had witnessed , beaten down by the maddening drum of the rain , scourged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flayed his face , stung his eyes . He hated the country at that moment . Hated it as if it were a living thing . But what about his pa ? He could see his father swept away like Nat , helplessly trying to swim , going under , drowning . But , he had heard voices , had n't he ? Maybe his pa and the others were still alive . Maybe they were stranded , too , cut off from high ground by the flash flood . He tried to remember from which direction the shouting voices had come when he had first heard them . He knew he could n't go back to the creek . Boots would n't go anyway . Still , he had to do something . Angrily , Morgan turned the horse , headed him on an angle that would take him toward the flooding creek higher up . I lc had no real sense of direction , could only bore into the rain using dead reckoning , hoping he would find a place above the wash where he could cross to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . His pa had told him about one he 'd seen coming over the Cumberland Gap from Virginia when Morgan was growing in his mother 's belly . Pa said it was mighty powerful and they were lucky he and his ma were on a hill when it swept through a big gully , washing away trees , wagons , everything in its path . His pa had told him about a family that had got caught in it . " You ever see one , get to high ground fast , " his pa had told him . But where was high ground ? The earth smelled dank , stank of dead animals and rotted vegetation . The land seemed flat , but from the saddle , he knew that there were small undulations in the surface . p 103 Boots did not fight him , so Morgan knew he must be headed in a safe direction . Then , he heard the voices again . Men shouting . Their voices sounded muffled in the incessant splash of rain . They faded and resurfaced on the wind currents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to ' em ! " someone shouted . " Damn you , Hauser , grab that rope ! " " Hawke , come quick ! " At first Morgan thought they were shouting at him , but as he rode closer , he heard the horses and mules clamoring with frenzied voices . The mules brayed in terror and the highpitched whinnies of the horses screeched on the wind like a thousand hawks in full cry . The men floundered in mud , their horses caught in the quagmire . Some of the pack animals were belly deep in the sinkhole . Patch and Loonie were trying to pull their mule out of ' the bog . Jocko was whipping his horse to no avail , trying to pull a pack mule onto dry ground . Dick Hauser , more muddy than the others , was twisted up in three ropes , horses pulling in opposite directions , panniers and packs askew , mud up to his knees . Morgan 's pa was trying to find a dry patch so that he could help Hauser , but he kept slipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud from head to toe , literally , and Morgan scarcely recognized him through the gauze of rain . " Turn loose of ' em ! " yelled Lem . " Dick , dammit , cut ' em loose . " Hauser , bewildered , tried to move , but the animals hemmed him in . They were terrified at being caught in the muck . Dick fell and got up again , even more encumbered than before . Finally , Lem clambered over to Hauser , grabbed one of his arms and jerked him free of the bog and the tangled reins . He  | dragged Dick up to high ground as the stock clambered to gain footing in the mire . Jocko DeSam floundered in mud up to his thighs . He cursed in French as he tried to catch up his horse . Packs were scattered on the edge of the quagmire , panniers rode cockeyed on the backs of the mules trying to find shelter in a grove of cottonwoods . Looking Loon and Patch Sisco dragged a foundering mule from the edge of the swampy bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped around a water oak 's trunk . Morgan rode over to them and dismounted . He helped pull the jenny out , then shouted through the rain . " Gim me the rope , Patch . I 'll help Jocko . " " Take it , son , " said Sisco . Morgan loosened the loop around the mule 's neck , gathered up all the slack . He ran to the other side of the slough and threw the looped end to Jocko . " Grab a hold " shouted Morgan . Jocko , sinking even deeper into the swamp , reached out for the rope . His hand failed to grasp it . Morgan retrieved it quickly , stepped closer to the edge of the bog . He swung the loop over his head and hurled it toward DeSam . Jocko lunged forward , grabbed one side of the loop . " Slip it around your chest , " said Morgan , as Patch and Loonie joined him . Jocko struggled , settling even deeper into the mire , until he was up to his waist . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hisself in a sinkhole , " observed Dave Sisco , " Damnfool pork eater . " Jocko rammed one arm through the loop . Morgan stood there helplessly as the Frenchman tried to get the other side  | around his shoulder . He seemed to be disappearing slowly into the sinkhole . The mud was almost up to his chest on his right side . " Get your other arm through , " Morgan pleaded . DeSam twisted , shrugged the loop over his other shoulder , then sank against the rope , exhausted from his struggles . " Hold on ! " Morgan bent his knees , pulled up the slack . The loop tightened around Jocko 's chest . Morgan crabbed backward , pulling hard . Loonie and Sisco stepped up and wrapped their hands around the bitter end of the rope . Their feet skidded on the gut-slick ground , but they managed to pull the Frenchman a few inches . Jocko 's hands kept slipping down the rope . The strands dug into his armpits , the loop squeezed his chest . He struggled to draw air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned around , leaning forward until he faced Patch and Loonie . He strained against the tug of the rope , feeling his slick-soled moccasins slipping on the rainsoaked soil . But , he felt a give and moved forward a few more inches . There was neither tree nor bush to wrap the rope around . The three men slithered to an angle , all tugging in unison . Jocko made no sound , except for the wheezing in his strangled chest . On the other side , Lem and Dick saw the struggle taking place , but had their hands full trying to rescue the panicky horses and mules still stuck in the swamp . " Let ' em go , Dick , " said Lem . " We 're only makin ' it worse . " Hauser , exhausted , sank to his knees , releasing the single rein in his hand . The horse backed up , tried to buck its way free of the mud 's suction . Lem grabbed him by one arm , dragged  | him away from the horses . The horses settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They began to move their legs up and down , heading toward firmer ground . " Maybe they 'll get out by themselves , " muttered Lem . Hauser could n't utter a word . When Lem released him , he sank to the ground , cold , wet and thoroughly discouraged . The rain made the rope hard to hold . Morgan 's hands kept sliding on the soaked strands . Patch did n't have much energy left . Loonie was conserving I his ; was n't much help . Morgan turned around to see if Jocko was making any progress . It did n't seem as if the rope had moved for the past two or three minutes . In fact , it seemed as if DeSam had slipped back an inch or two . The mud still gripped Jocko 's hips , but his waist was out of the sucking clutch of the quagmire . He looked like a dead man , though . Morgan sighed , tried for a better grip on the rope . " Jocko ? " he called . Jocko did n't answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shut up , " said Morgan . " Pull , damn you , pull . " " Testy , ai n't ye ? " Morgan shook his head to shed rain from his eyebrows and bent forward , girdling his waist with the rope for more leverage . He felt the rope move and his chest swelled as he took in an exultant gulp of air . Patch bore down , then , encouraged by the movement . Loonie , too , seemed to apply more effort to his piece of the rope . " We got him goin ' , do n't let up , " panted Morgan . " He 's a-comin ' , he 's a-comin ' . " It was true . Jocko slithered out of the tugging muck , his legs numb , useless . He twisted until he was on his back ; his feet p 107 broke free of the sludge , his moccasins buried somewhere in the bog . He looked like a corpse as he slid toward the bank on his back , his eyes closed , his chest barely moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamp . Patch loosened the noose around DeSam 's chest . " He ai n't hardly breathin ' much , " said Sisco . Morgan looked at the Frenchman . He looked blue in the wash of rain on his frozen face . " Jocko ? You alive ? " asked the young man . Jocko did n't answer . Across the bog , Lem and Hauser watched as the three men bent over the body of Jocko DeSam . Hauser rose to his feet . " He alive ? " called out Lem . Patch stood up , shrugged . He held the looped end of the rope in his hands . Morgan knelt down and began slapping DeSam 's face . He hammered a fist into Jocko 's chest . " Come on , Jocko , breathe , damn you . " Patch hunkered down , leaned his ear toward Jocko 's mouth . He listened for a few seconds , shook his head . " I do n't think he 's got no air in him , " said Sisco . " Deader'n a wilier stump . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collar of Jocko 's buckskins , began shaking him . " Do n't you die , Jocko , God damn you , do n't you dare die ! " Morgan 's high-pitched plea seemed torn out of his throat . Loonie 's eyes narrowed as he watched the boy shake the Frenchman as if trying to jar life back into his lifeless body . When Lem heard his son 's anguished cry , he started to trot around the bog . " Hell , son , " said Patch quietly , " what you gon na do if he do n't come tokill him ? "  | Jocko 's chest heaved . He drew in a breath and his eyelids fluttered . " Damned if Frenchie ai n't come back to life , " said Patch , wryly . " I done seen a miracle . " Morgan stopped beating on DeSam 's chest and rocked back on his legs , suddenly ashamed of himself . Lem and Dick arrived just as Jocko took his second deep breath and opened his eyes . " Yore boy done pounded the breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lem . " Jocko ? " said Dick . Lem glared at the man on the ground , then he looked up at Morgan . Morgan stared back at his father , a blank expression on his face . A feeling of lassitude surged through him . Jocko sat up , gulping air into his lungs . He rubbed his chest where the rope had left its marks in the flesh .  | " Ah , " he breathed . " It is good to be alive . " " The men around him , all except for Looking Loon and Lem , laughed . DeSam wiped rain from his face , squinted up at the sky . " Pretty soon , she stop , no ? " Morgan looked at the sky . The rain was slowing down , thinning out . " You sonofabitch , " said Lem . " You almost got us all kilt . Now we got to chase down stock . I got goods , goods bought and paid for , lost . I got to track it all down . " " Wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change the subject . Morgan saw that he was squirming over something . He wondered what his pa was so mad about . At the mention of Sullard 's name , Morgan squirmed some himself . Morgan cleared his throat . Everyone there , including Jocko , looked at him . " You seen Nat ? " asked Dick . " Hehe , " stammered Morgan . " He got carried off . " " Carried off ? " asked his father . " Flood , " squeaked Morgan . " I could n't do nothin ' to help him . " " Jesus , " said Hauser . Patch looked away , but Morgan saw the look in his eyes . Jocko DeSam paled visibly . " Having some goddamned fun were you , Jocko ? " taunted Lemuel Hawke . " That 's what your funnin ' done , you bastard . " " I did not know she was coming a storm , " said Jocko lamely . " Maybe we better straighten this out right now , " said Lem . " You want to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piss poor job so fur . You give me one good reason why we should pack with you . " Jocko lay there , panting . He seemed unable to get to his feet . " Yair , Jocko , " drawled Patch , " why do n't you tell Hawke there what you got up that sleeve of your'n . ' Pears to this old  | coon you been playin ' high and loose with what you been doin ' on this frontier . You bucked the major and he 's one bloodthirsty company bastard , but you did it sneaky and I do n't cotton to a man who runs out on a fair debt . " " Eh , Jocko , he pay what he owe , Patch . " DeSam glared at Sisco . " I been tryin ' to figger how you come to owe the Major any coin as it is , " said Patch , scrinching up his face . " You and him now used ter be close . You was his shadder , prac'ly ; his right hand . Now , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't make much sense . " Jocko heaved his shoulders in a Gallic shrug . " What are you drivin ' at , Patch ? " asked Lem . " Somethin ' mighty peculiar ' bout Jocko here cuttin ' out on his own , when he did . Either him or the Major 's up to something . I got sour poke in my belly ' bout it . " " Hell , the Major sent men to bring Jocko back and kill us . " " I reckon he did , " said Patch , but the look of puzzlement on his face stuck there like flies in spilt honey . Jocko looked up at Lemuel . " If I get up , you do not hit me , no ? " Lem clenched and unclenched his fists . " I 'm studying on it , " Hawke said . Hauser helped Jocko stand . DeSam 's sodden leathers creaked and rustled . Mud dripped down his leggings onto his bare feet . He swayed there , unsteadily , for a few seconds . Lemuel glared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rain became just a pattering , like light hail tapping on a sod roof , as scudding gray clouds thinned , blew eastward toward the Missouri at a fair clip . The wind flapped mildly at the men at the edge of the bog . Horses and mules still foundered , struggling to break free of the muck . " Major says you 're a spy for another fur outfit , " said Patch , p 111 skewering his quarry on words it seemed to Morgan he 'd held in his craw for a long time . Funny thing was , Jocko always swore by the Major , asked him and Pa to jine up with him back in Tennessee . Seemed Jocko was singing a different ditty now . " The chest , she hurts , " said DeSam . " I am trying to get the breath . " " You 're breathin ' same as me , " said Lem . " Spit out what you got to say . You workin ' for a company . Hell , it do n't make no difference to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' with is all . I heard tell of free trappers and company men and you been jumpin ' twixt and tween ever since I met up with you . " Jocko heaved a draught of air and sighed deeply . " Ah , what we must do , eh ? We have to play the games with the companies . We have to follow the rules or the booshway , he throw us in irons . My friends , you know what we must do to take the fur , eh ? " I do n't ken any of this stuff , " said Lem . " All I know is that you played hob with the stock and damned near got us all kilt , not to mention what you done to Morgan there . " " It is to test the boy 's mettle , no ? I play the little trick . I see what he do . " Smouldering sparks of anger flared through Morgan 's senses . " You done got Nat Sullard kilt is what you did , " said Morgan . He stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface . " Hold on now , Morg , " said Lem . " This is my fight . " He turned to DeSam . " That boy 's been tested a'ready , " he said . " Maybe I ought to give you some testin ' , Jocko . " Jocko shrugged , lifted his arms , turned the palms of his hands upward , as if in surrender . Lem relaxed his guard for a moment , indecisive . Jocko swung around , hauled back his right fist and drove it p 112 square into Lem 's belly . The air rushed from Hawke 's lungs as he doubled over in agony . His face purpled , swelled from the rush of blood to his brain . Jocko waded into him , swinging his left hand , which hooked into Lem 's right temple . Lem stag gered to one side . Jocko cracked his other temple with a right cross . Lem jolted sideways . Morgan cried out , but was frozen in place , rooted to the ground in surprise . DeSam kicked Lem in the groin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , pressing his advantage . The two fell to the muddy ground as the force of Jocko 's lunge drove Lem off his feet . Jocko grabbed Lem 's hair and jerked him forward . The Frenchman lifted his leg . Lem screamed as Jocko 's knee rammed suddenly into his genitals . He doubled up and Jocko kicked Hawke in the side , spinning him around . As Lem tried to gain his footing , DeSam threw Lem to the ground , pounced on him . He bit Lem 's ear , gouged at his eyes . Lem fought back , then , groggy from pain . He grabbed Jocko by the throat and pressed thumbs into the Frenchman 's windpipe . He drew his legs back and kicked at Jocko 's stomach . Morgan started to rush forward , but Patch grabbed his arm , held him back . " Let ' em fight it out , son , " he said softly . " Turn me loose , Sisco . II got to help my pa . " " You 'll only get hurt yourself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . Morgan wrenched loose from Patch 's grip and shoved the older man in the chest . " Leave me be , Patch ! " Morgan yelled . Loonie made a move to stop the boy . Morgan saw him coming and grabbed the handle of his knife . The Indian  | stopped . Patch nodded to Loonie , made a sign with his hands . Looking Loon held up both hands to show that they were empty . Morgan started across the mud-sogged ground , his moccasin soles slipping . He saw his father roll on top of Jocko , then go underneath the more experienced fighter again . Lem lost his grip on Jocko 's throat , stabbed frantically with rain-slick fingers to get a purchase on DeSam 's beard . Jocko grunted and plowed his right fist into Lem 's nose . Blood squirted from both nostrils . Pain brought tears to the elder I lawke 's eyes . Morgan reached Jocko just as the burly Frenchman was about to slam his fist into Lem 's face again . Hauser stepped up but Morgan batted Dick 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rush . He ringed Jocko 's neck with slender , deceptively strong arms , jerked him backward , wrenching hard to the left . Hauser rolled out of the way as Morgan and DeSam tumbled backward . Jocko flailed his arms , trying to get Morgan off his back . But young Hawke held on , squeezing DeSam 's neck as he twisted it sharply . " Aagh , " grunted Jocko , finally grabbing Morgan 's wrists , digging his mud-clogged nails into the flesh . He pulled mightily and loosened Morgan 's throttling hold . Lem scrambled to his feet , glared at DeSam as the Frenchman crabbed in a circle , regained his footing with a powerful thrust of his legs . Morgan , panting , pushed up to a squat , then stood up , fists clenched . " You want to see what I 'm made of , Jocko , you come on , " said Morgan , his voice a wheezy whisper . " Ah , the pup thinks he is a wolf , eh ? "  | " Morg , this is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on Jocko , " said DeSam . " Two against the one , eh ? " Morgan stood there , breathing deeply now , flexing his muscles as if to summon strength enough to overpower the burly Frenchman . " You come on , little boy . Jocko , he teach you how to make the fur fly , eh ? " The Frenchman , a grin on his face like a hideous stain , beckoned Morgan to engage him . Morgan gulped in a deep breath , lowered his head and charged . The trapper sidestepped like a dancer and slammed a knot-hard fist into Morgan 's left ear . Morgan 's head exploded with shattered fragments of bobbing lights . A dark blinding hole filled in the empty spaces . Tears stung his eyes and he choked on the sudden pain that flooded him like a grease fire . Jocko stuck out his leg . Morgan stumbled headlong but stayed afoot , the pain jabbing through his ear . He whirled , the rage in him a towering black funnel , fuming with heat . DeSam , surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off guard as Morgan charged again . Morgan barreled into Jocko , his head like a battering ram slamming into Jocko 's chest , knocking him backward toward the mudhole . Jocko tried to grab Morgan 's head , but the young man twisted free of the trapper 's grasp and grabbed Jocko 's leg at the calf . Morgan tugged the leg out from under Jocko and stalked in a short circle . Jocko fell , his leg seeming to twist out of its socket at the hip . Morgan pounced on his back , rode him into the ground . Jocko cursed in French just as Morgan grabbed the French- p 115 man 's neck and squeezed it with both hands . But the burly DeSam rolled underneath Morgan and broke the hold , leaving Hawke with two handsful of air . Lem , Dick , and Patch crowded closer , watching the young man and the Frenchman battle for position on the slick , muddy ground . Lem lunged everytime his son did , pantomiming his movements , growling instructions low in his throat . " Grab him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " yelled Hauser . Patch said nothing , but watched as Morgan slid away from Jocko 's grasping hand . " Damn little pup , " said Jocko , as he got to his feet and hurled himself in a low crouch after his young assailant . Morgan started to stand up , then hunkered back down to take the brunt of Jocko 's charge . Just as DeSam struck his knees , Morgan dove over Jocko 's back , but he was caught up short as Jocko grabbed an ankle with both hands . Morgan kicked free , but his forward motion was halted and he fell to the ground , knocking the wind from his chest . His ear throbbed as if a stake had been driven through it , clear to the brain . Jocko held on , twisted Morgan 's ankle . Morgan cried out in pain , kicked three times to free himself from the man 's iron grip . " Move , son , quick , " ordered Lem , crouching in a pugilist 's stance . " Get away from the bastard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reach . Jocko stood up , breathed in air like a blacksmith 's bellows . " Keep your hands off him , Jocko , " said Lem . " He start the fire , " said DeSam . " He can put it out if he want . " " Morgan , " said Lem to his son . p 116 " Leave me be , Pa . " Morgan 's eyes slitted . He wondered if he could whip Jocko . The man outweighed him . He was stronger . He seemed unbeatable . But , he did n't like being treated like a boy anymore . Maybe if he beat Jocko , the other men would look at him differently . Even his pa . It would be something to do , all right . Suddenly , Morgan felt strong . He felt a surge of strength through his muscles . He saw that he was as tall as Jocko . Yes , he was leaner , but a lot of the weight DeSam carried was fat . If he could just stay out of his way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down . Morgan would give him a sound drubbing then , beat him into the muck until he begged for mercy . " I 'm ready , Jocko , " breathed Morgan , a sense of lightness in his head , in his body . " Eh , Jocko he is ready , too . " Morgan filled his lungs . Then , he charged toward Jocko . But just as Jocko reared back a cocked fist to throw at him , Morgan glided out of reach . He jabbed a left to Jocko 's head , caught him on the jaw . It was a glancing blow , but it gave him satisfaction . Jocko spun around to catch Morgan , but the boy made an even wider circle . Morgan darted in and out , jabbing , ducking , swinging his head from side to side . He lashed at Jocko with light blows that seemed to cause no harm . But it was evident to the others that Jocko was irritated . They watched as Jocko grabbed for Morgan and came back with empty hands . Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untouched . He began to take more chances . I le darted in closer and used his feet . He kicked Jocko in the leg p 117 when Jocko was looking for a fist . He socked him in the chin when Jocko was bent over holding his knee . " You stop running , you little whelp cub . Jocko show you how to fight . " Morgan said nothing . Jocko stalked after him now and Morgan stayed out of his way . He kicked backward , once , when it seemed he was running away , and then he came up on Jocko 's side and rammed two hard punches into the back of Jocko 's neck . Jocko staggered under the blows and Morgan kicked him behind the knee . Jocko went down on one leg , seemed to struggle to get back up . Young Hawke followed up on his advantage . He kicked Jocko in the side , then kicked him hard in the face , landing the heel square on DeSam 's mouth . Blood oozed through the cracks in Jocko 's lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cheeks , each blow landing harder than the one before . Jocko held up his arms to escape the punishment , but Morgan , the fury in him hardened now to a cold metallic purpose , struck again and again until Jocko 's beard was running with blood , until his cheeks were mushy as apple pulp . " Assez , " yelled Jocko . " Suffisante . Arrete . " " He wants you to stop , Morgan , " said Patch . Morgan grabbed Jocko by the hair , held his head up and delivered one last smashing blow to his nose . There was a crack and blood gushed from DeSam 's nostrils like a crimson fountain . " That 's enough , son , " said Lem . " You 've done beat him . Beat him fair . " Lem looked around at the others to see if anyone challenged his assessment . p 118 Jocko slumped to the ground as soon as Morgan released his grip on the man 's hair . They all listened to the ugly sound of Jocko 's wheezy breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peppered the wet ground with tiny red spots . " What are you going to teach me now , Jocko ? " Morga mocked as he stepped away , panting for breath . Jocko waved a solitary hand in surrender . Lem walked over to his son , patted him gently on the back his shoulders . " You done mighty fine , Morg . " Morgan nodded , too weak to say anything . He started shake then and hoped his father could n't see it . It was n't fe but more like the excitement that came when he had big ga in his gunsights , something he could n't control . " You 'll be all right , " said the elder Hawke . " It 's like buc fever . Sometimes you get it when it 's all over . " Morgan looked at his father gratefully , nodded again . " Let 's get shut of this bunch , " said Lem . " Ai n't a damn o of ' em a bit of good . " " You mean go to the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . With a sight less trouble , too . " " What happened , Pa ? Why did you get so mad ? " " They played a joke on you , son . It was Jocko 's idee . They snuck up on you and stole the horses and mules . I did n't find out about it until it was too damned late . " " I thought they run off , " said Morgan , shaking his head . At that moment they all heard a rumbling , then the ghas sound of splintering wood and men screaming . " The river ! " yelled Hauser . " There 's trouble on the river Morgan looked off to the right . It sounded so close . had n't realized how near they were to the Missouri . All heads turned as the first cries for help wafted their p 119 And , above it all , the horrible sounds of men in agony , men screaming with their last breaths above the roar and tumult , the crunching sound of a keelboat being crushed by something big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree jutting out from the bank at a bend in the river . Too late to warn the helmsman , he knew . Instead , he cursed at the snag that caught the prow of the keelboat . The curse died on his lips , however , as the craft spun wildly in the current and slammed against the bank beneath the bluffs . One of the men yelled a warning and Angus looked up at the bluff . The rain had stopped , but there was a fine mist hanging in the air like shreds of gauze . Atop the cliff , a chunk of limestone slid down a crevice , then stopped . The chunk teetered , then continued its slide , dislodging other formations in its path . " Look out ! " yelled Fletcher Bancroft . " She 's gon na come right down on us ! " Josie Montez , manning one of the poles amidships , measured the angle of the boat , its position in the river and the p 121 course of the small avalanche in a single instant . His brows furrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw down his pole , backed away , headed toward the stern . If the rocks all came down and struck a ledge , they could strike aft of the bow . Men would be hurt , possibly killed . " Major , " said Montez . MacDougal looked at Josie , saw where he was going and moved in that direction . A huge section of limestone broke off the cliff and tumbled straight down , struck an outcropping and caromed out over the boat , landing on the foredeck of the keelboat . The craft shuddered like a wounded beast under the impact ; timbers shivered the length of the vessel . Wood cracked and splintered as the shower of rock smashed the cargo box , fractured deck planks and surged deep into the hull . Men at the bow scattered as they frantically tried to escape the destruction , but two of them were pinned by a large slab of rock that had sheared off another when it struck . The boat tipped queasily , throwing men against the gunwales , slamming them against iron davits , knocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the miniature avalanche , the whole side of the bluff seemed to teeter for a moment , then come apart as pieces of rock broke off , knocked other pieces loose and dislodged still others in random downward flight . Tons of soft limestone roared downward , smashing trees and rocks , exploding into fragments that flew off and struck the boat all along its length . The men on the second craft , behind the lead boat , tried to swing clear , but rammed into the stern of the Major 's vessel . The prow impaled itself in the lead boat 's scuppers , stuck there like a giant wedge , stuck fast as if it had been bonded there by nails and iron straps . Several men on the Major 's boat were struck by flying rock and shattered wood slivers . Some went down , bleeding pro-  | fusely from head and facial wounds . Men screamed and cried out in terror and pain as the keelboat broke up and began to founder . A man grabbed the side of his head and came away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a razorsharp fragment of stone . Those on the second boat scrambled over the sides and some leaped up on the railings and jumped into the swirling waters of the Missouri , following the men escaping from the lead boat . Those who could not swim sank like stones and drowned in a strangling silence deep under the current . " Men , do n't panic , " shouted the Major as he fought off choking clouds of dust . " Fletch , get some men and start throwing our supplies toward the bank . Get as much as you can off this boat and then get the hell off yourself . " " There 's no time for that , " said Montez . " This boat is going down . " " Montez , shut your mouth , " said MacDougal . " Men , get the traps off or you wo n't earn a penny this year . " Although MacDougal appeared outwardly calm , there was a shrill edge to his voice . The deck tilted under his feet and the boat seemed to sink deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , " said MacDougal . " Save your-selves . " Bewildered trappers stared blankly at MacDougal as he stumbled through the debris and climbed over the side of the boat , rifle in hand . In a moment , he was wading toward shore , fighting the pull of the current , leaning hard to port , straining to keep from being sucked under . He kept his eyes on the bluff above , as if ready to duck another shower of rocks . Other men began to crawl over the sides of the boat , following him . A few grabbed their rifles , others abandoned ship with celerity , forsaking their belongings as well as their injured companions . Fletcher led the pack .  | Josie Montez started to follow the panicky men , but the keelboat began to break up , the hull cracking in two amidships . The halves of the boat tilted and he was hurled to the port side , slammed hard against the gunwales . He fought for breath as the craft wallowed in its death throes , water filling its ballast compartments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the opposite bank , Dick Hauser clambered up out of the thick brush , halted . A floundering man , weighted down by wet buckskins , reached the bank and held up a hand . Dick stooped down , grabbed the man 's wrist and hauled him ashore . The man lay there for several moments , spitting water , gasping and choking . Dick knelt down beside him . " You gon na live , child ? " The man looked up at Hauser . " Who might you be ? " " Why , Dick Hauser . And you ? " The man sat up , wiped water from his face with a swipe of a swarthy paw . " Josie . Josie Montez . " " Then you 'd be Spanish Jack 's brother . " " You knew Jack ? " " I did . Drunk his grog enough . " " Were you there when he was murdered ? " Montez 's tone gave Hauser pause . He scratched his head . " Why , I do n't rightly recollect . I ' member the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the man who knocked my brother cold , set the fire and left him to die , " said Montez . At that moment , Patch and Looking Loon appeared out of the willows and brush where they had stopped and waited for Hauser to look around first , staring at the sinking lead boat , then at the stricken second vessel . They stopped when they saw Hauser talking to Josie Montez. p 124 " Well , I could n't help you there , " Hauser said warily . He got back to his feet and looked out at the river . Most of the surviving men on the lead boat waded ashore and gathered around the Major , who had walked well clear of the unstable bluff . Men from the second boat began to abandon ship in a more orderly fashion , making for the eastern shore , small clots of survivors sticking together like bewildered rabble . It was clear to them that their boat would be useless unless it could free itself of the sinking lead vessel . A few men foundered in deep water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Morgan and Lem emerged from the underbrush . They saw the men on the opposite shore and the bodies on the deck of the lead keelboat . " Pa , lookit , " said Morgan . " ' Pears that bluff done toppled down and broke that boat up , kilt some men . " " What can we do ? " " Do n't look like we can do much . I 'm think in ' it 's a damned good thing we was n't on that boat . Looks like the Major 's done got hisself some troubles that ai n't gon na go away right quick . " Morgan felt a surge of elation , despite the soreness in his legs and fists . He could see men on the deck of the lead keelboat who appeared dead or sorely wounded . There was an arm sticking out of the rubble next to the cargo box . The arm did not move ; the hand attached to it hung limply like some grave marker made of human flesh . The side of the bluff where the massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark scar . Dust still hung in the air and Morgan heard a series of low , pathetic moans coming from somewhere inside the boat . Men p 125 still scrambled over the side of the stricken vessel , some limping , holding onto their legs , others staggering like drunks , grasping bloodied heads , capless , their buckskins dark with sanguinous stains . There was a stench in the air that reminded Morgan of hog butchering , right after their bellies were slit and coils of intestines spilled out onto the ground like newborn snakes , all a-glistening , slick with an oily slime . Beyond , he saw men gathered around MacDougal . The Major looked up , seemed to catch Morgan 's eye . MacDougal scanned the bank where Morgan stood , as if looking for someone . Morgan 's gaze shifted upstream where Hauser stood with another man , a swarthy Spaniard who looked somewhat familiar . " What 're you lookin ' at , Morgan ? " asked his father . " That man with Dick . He look like someone we know ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't put him in no place . " The Spaniard looked downstream . " He 's lookin ' at us , Pa . " " I see it . " The Spaniard looked away , began speaking to Hauser . " He 's askin ' Dick about us , Pa . " " Aw , Morgan , you do n't know what he 's a-sayin ' . " " He 's pointin ' at us , " said Morgan . " Probably askin ' who we are . " It struck Morgan then who the man was . It was just a feeling , an odd feeling , like he had seen him before , but he knew he never had . His thoughts went back to that last night in St. Louis , when his pa had come up to Willa 's room and caught him naked with Spanish Jack 's daughter . He remembered Jack coming into the room , the fight , the broken lamp scattering fire p 126 and oil all over the bed , the walls . Spanish Jack was knocked cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner had died in the blaze that burned the building to the ground . " I 'll bet that 's Spanish Jack 's brother , " said Morgan softly . He heard his father draw in a quick breath , saw him look upriver at the Spaniard . " Damn . Might could be . Looks to be a Spanisher . " " Pa , let 's go . I do n't like it here . Ai n't nothin ' we can do . " " Yep , we best get on , " said Lem . Josie Montez called to them . " You there . " " Do n't answer him , Pa , " said Morgan . " He 's a-comin ' this way . " Morgan grabbed his father 's hand and pulled on it . Lem followed reluctantly . " Come on , Pa . " " I 'm a-comin ' . " Montez started toward them , then thought better of it when he realized he had no firearm . The Major started barking orders at the trappers on the opposite bank , urging them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to venture back to the boats , sheepish expressions on their faces . Some clambered aboard the second vessel and began throwing lines to those on shore . Others began rigging a line to the first boat , which was sinking badly , breaking up in the surging current . Pieces of sundered trees and other flotsam floated past , testifying to the power of the current with freshly fallen rain propelling it with enormous force . It wound past the banks , shouldering the boats up against the bank , surged on like an angry serpent mining a new path through the earth . " You there ! Hawke ! " Lem and Morgan halted , turned toward Josie Montez. p 127 " I will catch you ! " yelled Montez , holding up a clenched fist . " You will pay ! Goddamn you ! " " Let 's go , Pa , " said Morgan . " I ought to settle this now , " said Lem . " How ? " Lem patted the handle of the knife hanging on his belt . " No , Pa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly like a cold fog . Montez drew his own knife , held it up . He beckoned to Lem with his free hand . There was a grin on his face , visible even at that distance . " Some other time ! " Lem yelled . " You bet , cabron ! " Montez slashed the air with the blade of his knife . " I will kill you like you killed my brother ! " A muscle quivered along Lem 's jawline . His eyes narrowed for a brief moment . Then he followed Morgan into the under-brush . When they returned to the muddy buffalo wallow , there was no sign of Jocko DeSam . Some of the horses were missing , others stood disconsolately under still dripping trees , their heads hanging in weariness . After they caught up their own stock and mounted Boots and Hammerhead , Lem pulled the mules to the north . " We goin ' to the mountains by ourselfs , Pa ? " " I reckon . We got all what we need . " " But we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find what these fellers found , all right . " " How ? " " We 'll just foller the river until we come to the mountains . Then we 'll go up ' em and find the beaver , the mink and marten . " " Do you know how to cotch ' em ? " asked Morgan . p 128 " I can figger it out , son . Silas , he tolt me how to set the traps , bait ' em . I got me some castoreum in Saint Louie for bait . " Morgan remembered Silas coming to their farm , showing them a beaver pelt with its thick shiny fur . That was when Silas gave him the medicine horn , told them about the riches in the mountain streams . " What 's castoreum ' ? " " It 's beaver piss , I reckon . Silas says it plumb draws them to the traps set in the water . " " Must have a smell to it . " " It 's ' bout as powerful as skunk , I reckon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammerhead began to move around the perimeter of the mudhole . Morgan , on Boots , followed , checking the pan on his .64 caliber Kentucky-made rifle to see if the powder was dry . There was only a small amount and it was damp . He spent the next several moments wiping the pan dry , repouring fine powder in the pan , blowing away the excess . He checked the striking flint , adjusted it slightly so that it sat just right in the leather , not so firm that the flint would break when it struck sparks off the frizzen . Satisfied , he began to take notice of the country again . Later , Morgan 's thoughts drifted back to other times . " Pa , I got a question . " " You go right ahead , son . " " Are most people bad like Josie Montez ? Always wantin ' to fight or kill somebody for no good reason ? " " I reckon some of ' em is . " " Seems like we keep runnin ' into trouble ever'where we go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , " said Lem wryly . " You mean Willa Montez ? " " And your ma . " " Ma ? Ma bad ? " p 129 " She was n't bad exactly , son . She just did some bad things . Run out on us . Made some mistakes , maybe . " " I wish I could have got to know her better , " said Morgan . " Might have helped if she had stayed home more , not had all them fancy idees . " " I guess she did n't like us much . " Lem laughed harshly , but he knew his son was not trying to be funny . Morgan was so serious the way he said it and it was really was n't anything to laugh at . " I reckon there are some good people , Morg . They all probably start out good enough , but they 's hard lessons in this world and maybe some folks do n't take kindly to teachin ' . I figger a man goes bad because of what other men do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a-growin ' . Seems like it just keeps gettin ' passed along , the bad , until it 's real hard for a man to be good anymore . " " You mean it ai n't no use bein ' good , then ? " " You can be as good as the next man will let you , Morg . " " It do n't seem like nobody cares much . I mean , what 's inside a man , how a man feels about things . I seen more bad men than good since we left the farm . " " I reckon you have at that . " The sun showed for a moment , then clouds slid into the hole above the two riders to darken the sky once again . " Sometimes I wish we could just be all by ourselfs . " " Well , that ai n't growin ' none , Morg . It ai n't natural . You do n't learn no lessons . You get hard inside after seein ' enough meanness in the world . You get to knowin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own self . You do n't lean on nobody and you do n't let nobody lean on you . That 's what you learn if you 're payin ' attention . " Morgan chewed on what his father had said , but he was still trying to make sense of what had happened to them . Going  | down the Natchez Trace they worried about robbers and Indians , but the only trouble they 'd ever had was when they were in a town or around other men . And they had had nothing but trouble ever since leaving St. Louis . He wondered if going to the mountains was such a good idea after all . And he wondered , if they 'd ever make it out there alive , if they 'd get back to civilization alive . There were times , like now , when living seemed such a hopeless chore . A damned chore , like chopping wood and then seeing it all go up a chimney in smoke . And then have to do it all over again . The thought of it made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much to look forward to , even if they did make it to the mountains and got rich trapping beaver and such . They skirted a marshy spot full of cattails and blackbirds , a low place where the river made another bend . Scudding gray clouds still hid the sun , draping the country in gloom . " What about Silas , Pa ? " " Huh ? " " Is Silas Morgan a good man ? " " Good as any , I reckon . Why ? " " Oh , nothing . I was just figgerin ' if we ever saw him again how it would be . " " Why , it 'd be just fine , Morgan . I named you after him . He was always right with me . Your ma did n't like him much . " Morgan said nothing , but his thoughts scrambled wildly to find some meaning , something he could rest easy on , like a pillow , where it was all safe and quiet and there were no bad men in the world . They followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretching westward toward the falling sun . " I reckon we can find our way , long as we foller this here  | river , " his Pa said late that afternoon . It had been so quiet , his voice startled Morgan . " I reckon , Pa . " The sun was out again . Morgan 's buckskins and moccasins were dry . He was hungry and his belly growled at the emptiness . He kept thinking of the fight with Jocko , wondered where the Frenchman had gone . A few moments later , when the sun was an hour above the western horizon , he had part of his answer . They heard voices . Many voices . His father reined up , put a finger to his lips . Morgan rode up alongside his father , a puzzled look on his face . Lem slid out of the saddle . Morgan did the same . They tied up the animals to sturdy trees and took their rifles with them as they sneaked toward a hillock , crouching low . The voices grew louder . Lem lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top of the mound . Morgan slithered up beside his father . They looked down on a strange sight . There , where the river took one of its innumerable bends , a horde of men were breaking camp , tearing down hide and canvas shelters , packing up goods , loading them on horses and mules , storing them in pirogues and canoes that bobbed on tethers along the bank . Others were digging in the side of the hill that sheltered them from the view of anyone on the river . Overseeing all the bustle stood Jocko DeSam , atop the bank , pointing to caches yet undug . He barked orders in French and English . " Pa . . . " Morgan whispered . " I know . Jocko knew what he was a-doin ' all the time . Likely those men been a-waitin ' on him . " p 132 " What 's that those men are diggin ' outen that hill ? " " Looks to be trade goods or such . " One of the men dropped a box and several kegs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan asked . Behind them , they heard a soft , rustling sound . Turning , they saw Patch and Looking Loon walking up . They were carrying rifles , their stock tied near where the Hawkes had left their horses and mules . Patch crawled up beside them . Looking Loon stayed behind , crouched low . " Whiskey , most likely , " said Patch . " Whiskey ? " said Lem . " I thought ... " " Illegal as hell , " said Patch . " That damned Jocko . I knowed he was up to no good . " " What 's he do with it ? " whispered Morgan . " Swaps it to the Injuns for furs . Likely he 's got trade guns in those blankets , too . Injuns 'll pay dearly for such . " " Guns illegal , too ? " asked Lem . " Mebbe not , but you give a Injun a thunder stick and you 're jest askin ' him to use it on you . " Looking Loon slid up to them , silent as smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trappers began pushing off in pirogues and canoes , cargo piled high between two paddlers in each small boat . " We best get along , " said Patch . " Jocko wo n't like it none , us knowin 's he 's smuggling whiskey upriver past the booshway . " " I reckon , " said Lem . " You want company ? " Patch asked . " Just me and Loonie there . " Lem looked at his son . Morgan shrugged . " We 'll see how it works out , " said Lemuel . " This chile knows you been burnt by folks , " said Patch .  | " We mind our own business , me and Loonie . Do n't look in another coon 's poke . They 's some trails you might not know about yonder . " Patch nodded toward the west where the light was strongest in the sky now that the sun had disappeared behind a cloud bank . " Where you headed , exactly ? " asked Morgan . " Have to see when we get to the mountains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade if he knows what he 's a doin ' . " " I just do n't want to run into Jocko again , " said Morgan . Patch looked at the boy . " Why , I do n't reckon he much wants to run into you , neither , " said Patch , a wry smile playing on his lips . " But you never know for sure what 's around the next bend of the river , son . You know that Josie Montez will be on your trail ? " " Yeah , I know , " said Lem . " He 'd be a bigger worry than Jocko , I 'm thinkin ' . " Lem looked away . " Best we keep movin ' , " said Patch . " Montez got him a horse from the Major 's herd on shore , swam him to the boat for his rifle and possibles . Me'n Loonie 'll keep a eye or two on our backtrail . " Lem nodded but said nothing . The four men slid back off the hillock , walked to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fading away . Just before he mounted up , Morgan looked at Patch and Looking Loon as they rode off ahead . Maybe , he thought , Sisco was n't a bad man , like the others . The only thing he knew about the silent Delaware was that Loonie had eaten his dog . Morgan got sick to his stomach every time he thought about it . p 134 As if reading his thoughts , Looking Loon turned around and looked at Morgan , doubled up a fist , feinted with it , then ducked as if avoiding a blow . He then made the sign of approval with the same hand . And grinned wide .  | Patch pointed across the river . " See that lake yonder ? " he asked Morgan and Lem . Father and son nodded . " Lewis and Clark called it Sugar Lake . River takes a long northern swing here . If'n we cut across due west , we 'll meet up with it again . Take us less'n a week and we 'll gain some ground on Jocko and the Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fill your canteens . Ai n't much good water ' twixt here and there . " Morgan watched as Patch unslung a large furry pouch and walked to the river . " What 's that water jug made out of ? " asked young Hawke . " Buffler balls . " " Huh ? " p 136 " Shot me a buffler , made a canteen out of its ball sack , glued hide to it . Keeps the water wet and cool . " Morgan did n't know whether to believe Sisco or not . They filled their canteens at the river and rode on across the prairie . Patch led them with an unerring eye , always looking back to see if anyone was following them . Lem and Morgan did the same . Looking Loon ranged far ahead , scouting and hunting . The men fed on his kills of rabbit , squirrel , prairie chicken , quail and fawn at night under clear , star-flocked skies in sheltered depressions while the Delaware sat away from them , watching , listening . The silence was eerie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his shoulders . When the coyotes howled , he crouched closer to the fire until he got used to their plaintive singing , but the sound always startled him when he first heard it . " What made that bog you got caught in ? " Morgan asked Patch one night . " Old buffler wailer , son . Used to be a passel of ' em along the river , but the Injuns and trappers comin ' up the Missoura run ' em off . " " Are the buffler big ? " asked Morgan . " Why , I reckon some of ' em get bigger'n a horse , " said Patch . He made sign with his hands and Loonie grinned . " Will we see any ? " " Shore , son . And a mite more , too . If you see buffler , you 'll likely see Injuns . " " Are the buffler good to eat ? " " Best vittles on God 's green earth , " replied Patch . " Onliest thing is , the Injuns figger they own ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe in another place , so you always got to watch out where you are when you shoot a baler . " " You think we 'll run into Injuns ? " asked Lem , scooting p 137 closer to the fire . There was a chill blowing off the river and this was the first fire they 'd had that was big enough to warm a man . " Biggest trouble we 're likely to have is with them scurrilous Blackfoot , " said Patch . " Andy Henry come back to St. Louie last year with some ha'r-raisin ' tales . Near ever'body thought he was dead . " " Where are these scurry Blackfoot ? " asked Morgan . Patch did n't laugh . " Mostly where the fur be , but they 's places we can go , I 'm thinkin ' , and if we keep a sharp lookout , we can keep our hair . " " How 'd you find these places ? " asked Lem , backing off from the small fire . He no longer looked into it because it blinded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want to hear more about the Blackfoot , " said Morgan . " You ever heard of Colter ? " asked Patch . " Drouillard ? " " I reckon not , " said Lem . Morgan shook his head . " John Colter now . There be a mountain man . Ever hear tell of Manuel Lisa ? " " We 've heard about him , " said Morgan . " Back in ought seven , Lisa and a bunch traveled up this very river , built a fort at the mouth of the Big Horn , that 's a river what runs into the Missoura . He come back in ought eight with beaver a-plenty , and marten , mink , lynx , muskrat , too , got ever'body fired up in St. Louis , by gum , and General Clark hisself got George Drouillard , Tom James , me , and about three hunnert or more men to go up there and trap those beaver ponds . We got up to Fort Manuel , that 's what Lisa called it , went on up to Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' all over creation for the place , when them Blackfoot jumped us . Kilt three men who was scattered out scoutin ' trails . They robbed them , they kilt them and then come on the rest of  | us a few days later . Kilt a whole bunch , including Drouillard . Some of the brigade pulled out , but some of us stuck with Andy Henry . " But them damned Blackfoot swarmed down on us again and took the heart out of all of us , scattered us all over them mountains like wild partridge . Henry , he set out for the Snake and I come back to St. Louis with nothin ' to show for it . Last year , I went back up the Missouri with the Major and we done pretty good . We thought Henry might have lost his hair , but he showed up last summer lookin ' like a hard winter , which he done had . He come in with forty packs of beaver . That gave us all heart and here I am again , ready to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Lem . " Oh , they 'll be lookin ' after their huntin ' grounds , but I learnt somethin ' last winter . They do n't much like them high places when the snows come in thick , but the beaver , why , they do just fine in their mud-and-stick lodges . I got me the idee to go some deeper into those mountains . I stuck it through last winter , and Lisa said it was the worst he 'd ever seed . So , we might stay out of the way of the Blackfoot , least until spring . " " I hope so , " said Morgan dreamily . Lem looked at the silent Delaware , wondering if he understood what Patch had been saying . Looking Loon did n't appear to show any interest in the conversation . He just sat there , grinning idiotically . " How come you got an Injun partner after all that trouble with the Blackfoot ? " Lem asked . " Oh , Loonie , he ai n't like them other Injuns . He 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Blackfoot , neither . His brother was one of them kilt with Henry 's bunch . Loonie would as soon kill a Blackfoot as a snake . "  | Morgan did not count the days , but marked their passage westward by the rivers Patch Sisco pointed out to them . They passed the Platte , the Nodaway , the Tarkio , rode north and camped one night at the confluence of the East and West Nishnaboina rivers , just to avoid running into other trappers . They rode south again , following the Missouri . Patch pointed out Council Bluffs to them , rode around a hunting party of Otos , always staying well away from the Missouri until nightfall , when they filled their canteens . Everyday they saw deer and the wide paths of buffalo herds . Morgan wondered when they would see buffalo , but he kept silent . He began to get a feeling for the land that was strange to him . He had never before seen so much space all at oncethe land , the sky , the distant horizon , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ground no one had ever trod before . Every sunrise was startling to him , each sunset more spectacular than the one before . It was sometime in June when they camped on Soldier River , and a few days later , they saw Blue Lake , and beyond , Blackbird 's grave . It was early July , the days having passed in a haze of sun and rain and always the land stretching out before them and receding behind them . Morgan 's pulse beat faster and he began to feel a part of the country as if it was where he was supposed to have been all his life . He played cruel tricks on Looking Loon , hiding one of his moccasins while Loonie bathed , putting bugs in his possibles pouch when the Delaware was n't looking , sticking a live blacksnake in his saddlebag where he kept his dried food . Loonie acted surprised each time he discovered something alien among his belongings and yet he never did more than flash Morgan an idiotic grin . " You ought not to tease that Injun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean no harm . "  | " One of these days you 'll go too fur , and he 'll get his dander up . " " I do n't think he 's got no dander to get up , " Morgan cracked . Morgan shook Patch 's shoulder gently . This was the morning the old trapper had promised to take the boy hunting . Loonie had told Patch of a water hole laced with deer tracks , some two miles from camp . Morgan and Patch had scouted the hole the night before , selected spots where they might sneak in and wait for game should the wind be right . Fog hung in the tall grasses , motionless in the still dawn . Patch stepped softly , following a swath that only he could remember from the night before . Morgan stepped in his tracks , careful to make no sound . His ears seemed tuned to the slightest sound . The silence was acute . They came to the edge of the water hole . The cream light in the eastern sky barely made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pond , each separated from the other by a distance of fifty yards . Patch grabbed Morgan 's shoulder , turned him toward the knoll on the right . Morgan nodded and set off for his spot . Patch disappeared in the high grass . When Morgan sat down in the grasses , he could not be seen . The wind was at his face . He looked off to the left and could not see Patch , but knew he was sitting there , hidden in the swale . The land lit up gradually , the shadows pulling across the water hole , gold touching the tips of the grasses , turning them tawny , the pond taking on a pink glaze . Morgan listened intently , heard the distant piping of a bird he could not identify . Then , he heard the rustle of grasses and his senses tautened like rawhide drying in the sun . A mosquito sang in his  | ear , but he sat stockstill , peering toward the sound of the whispering grasses . The pond lay in a shallow depression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to come down into it . The walls would slow them down if they tried to get out in a hurry . Morgan studied the pond carefully , figuring all the ways a deer might run if he and Patch missed their shots , or if something spooked the animals before they could touch off shots . Minutes snailed by in an agony of waiting . Finally , the grasses parted and a deer stepped out of the swale . It stood there , stiffly , sniffing the windless air , its ears flicking as they moved in half-circles . Morgan 's heart froze as the deer , anterless so that he could not tell if it was a buck or a doe , looked straight at him . Then it lowered its head and moved toward the water hole . A moment later , another deer came out of the same swath , not so warily as the first , but moving slowly , its slender legs jerking with each step . When the second deer got to the water and bent its head to drink , Morgan took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right . It had already slaked its thirst and stood rigidly still , its head facing off to the east . Morgan figured Patch would take the one closest to him . Slowly , he brought up his rifle , careful not to slide the barrel against the grass . He stopped his motion as the second deer lifted its head , water dripping from its chin and muzzle . Morgan held his breath , listened to his pulse tap out the seconds as time crawled by slower than a snail through thick grass . It seemed to him that the deer could hear his heart pounding , that they could see him holding the rifle he had not yet aimed . Finally , the second deer dropped its head down to the water and began to drink .  | Morgan eased the muzzle of the rifle downward , fixing his right eye on the blade front sight . He held steady on the deer 's flank where its heart should be , just behind the shoulder . He let his breath out in a silent whisper . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trigger , squeezed . The flint struck the frizzen , showered sparks into the pan . There was a goof as the fine powder ignited , shot flame through the touchhole to the main charge . The rifle roared and bucked against Morgan 's shoulder . White smoke and orange flame belched from the muzzle . The smoke obscured the two deer and everything between Morgan and the water hole . Morgan heard another explosion to his left a split-second after he fired and knew that Patch had taken his shot , as well . Morgan listened for the sounds of hoofbeats , but heard nothing . He rose up , grasping his medicine horn . He stuck the plug in his teeth , pulled it free . He poured fresh powder into the palm of his left hand , mounded it up over an imaginary ball . Quickly , he drew his fingers into a cone , poured the powder down the barrel . He shook the loose grains from his palm , brought the rifle up , tamped the stock to knock the powder to the bottom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed them over the muzzle . He started the ball with his thumb , took his wiping stick and rammed the load home , tamped it down tight . He shook fine powder from the smaller horn into the pan , blew the excess away . The smoke cleared as he walked toward the water hole , reloaded , the frizzen knocked down over the pan . He checked the leather scrap and flint to see that they were tight and straight . Patch met him where the two deer lay , their hearts smashed , their eyes glazed with the frost of death . " You shoot true , son , " said Patch . " So do you , " replied Morgan , looking at Patch 's deer . Its  | tongue was caught between its teeth . It had dropped in its tracks , a .62-caliber ball through its heart . " With a little seasonin ' , you 'd do to ride the river with . " " What 's that mean ? " asked Morgan . " Means a man can count on you . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's full of wooly worms . " " I hope so , Patch . " The two men gutted out their deer , skinned them and used the hides to carry the choice chunks of meat back to camp . Along the way , they stopped to rest on a knoll . It was still early and the earth smelled sweet and summery . Bees plumbed the wildflowers and prairie birds chortled in the greening grass . " Let 's take a look at that powder horn you got there . " " That 's my medicine horn , " said Morgan , making no move to hand it over . " Set store by it , do you ? " " I do . " " How 'd you come by it ? " " A friend of Pa 's give it to me . " " Looks like a bufller horn , all right . Kin I look at it , son ? " " Sure , " said Morgan . He slipped the medicine horn from his shoulder , handed the carrying thong to the old trapper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mighty fine work , " he said . " Good polish to it . " Morgan said nothing , but beamed inwardly at the compli-ment . Patch studied the symbols , cocked his good eye , brought it close to the horn . " These be Absaroky markin 's , " he said . " Crow . You got yourself a Crow powder horn , son . " " I know . Silas told me . " " Silas Morgan . He might of got it off one he kilt , or he could 've traded for it , I reckon . He say which ? " p 144 " No , I reckon not , " said Morgan . Patch handed the powder horn back to Morgan . " Do you know what those markings mean , Patch ? " " Big medicine , fur as I know . Maybe you might need it . " " What do you mean ? " " Nothin ' . " But , there was something in Patch 's craw . Morgan noticed lately that Sisco watched Lem a lot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't spying , exactly , but Patch showed an uncommon interest in Lem Hawke . " Is it somethin ' about my pa ? " Patch jumped as if startled . An expression fled across his face too fast for him to hide it . " He 's packin ' him a load is all . " " What do you mean ? " " The man keeps lookin ' over his shoulder and at night he do n't sleep good . " " I seen you lookin ' over your shoulder , too . " " Ai n't the same . He 's lookin ' for something what ai n't there . " " Ai n't nothin ' there when you look , neither , " said Morgan . " I know what I 'm lookin ' for , " said Patch . " And , he still do n't sleep real good . Like he 's fightin ' someone in his dreams . " " He 's always done that . " " Always ? " " Sincesince Ma left us . " " He ought to get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ' em much , I reckon . " " Welp , he 'll find him one , maybe . I think he 's got Josie Montez on his mind some , too . " " Pa ai n't afraid of nobody , " said Morgan .  | " Might be he ought to be a peck afraid of Josie Montez . That ' uns got a scalp or two on his belt . " " He better not try to stick Pa . I 'd shoot him dead . " " Montez ai n't the kind to walk up to a man and say what for . He works best at night behind a man 's back . " " You do n't worry about us none , Patch , hear ? " " I hear you , Morgan . " Patch opened his mouth as if to say something else , but he closed it quickly . He got up , then , hefted his meat and set off for their camp . He noticed that they took a different way back and Patch stopped every so often to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground and put his ear to the earth . Everytime he did that , the hairs on the back of Morgan 's head bristled and he shivered with the odd chill of it .  | Josie Montez waited until after Jocko DeSam had beached his dugout on the sandy bank . He had been riding along the river 's course watching the Frenchman and his companion , staying just out of sight until the two decided to come to shore . He had long since lost the trail of the Hawkes , Sisco and the Delaware . But , he knew that DeSam 's bunch were strung out for miles on the Missouri , way ahead of the Major 's brigade . DeSam climbed out of the boat , lashed its prow to a tree near the shore . Dick Hauser , in the stern , grabbed his and DeSam 's rifles and stepped over the gunwale onto the bank . He handed DeSam 's rifle to him and looked downriver . Another craft rounded the bend : a canoe carrying three men and goods . Montez rode up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you leave the Major 's brigade , " said DeSam in English . " I thought you would come by boat . "  | " Let us speak the tongue , " said Montez in fluent French . He looked at Hauser , cocked his head . The other boat , a canoe , shot onto the shore a few yards from where DeSam 's dugout lay tethered . The three men spoke in rapid French , secured their craft and began unloading their cargo , carrying it to a stand of cottonwoods . The river rose and fell with its own surging pulse . This was a wide point and the water flowed gently , calmly . The sky was cloudless , blue as periwinkle , the air , warm and summery , seethed with insects , mayflies and yellow-winged butterflies . Two more canoes carved a path to the shore and beached upstream . The babble of voices speaking in French drifted through the willows and cottonwoods , strangely disembodied . " But , yes . Jean Lafitte taught you well our language . " " Jean taught me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you get the goods I had brought up for you ? " " They are in the boats . We found the cache , as you said we would . We went by the forts at night . It is good . " " Smuggling is my trade , " said Montez . " And Lafitte ? What has become of that pirate ? " " He prefers to be called a privateer . He did not fight for the British at New Orleans . He helped the Americans . " " Andy Jackson ? I heard in St. Louis that the American soldier won . " " They made him a major-general . He won the battle with ease , but the war was already over . There was a treaty , but the American government did not sign the papers . Many British died . " " And which side did you fight on ? " " I fought with Jean . He is going to ask for a pardon . " " Ah , fat chance . " " He will get something , " said Montez. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of canoes rounded the bend , skidded across the flattened waters , twisted toward shore . Upstream , a plover piped a plaintive curlicued trill at the presence of intruders as men stalked the shore for firewood . " You want me to go away , Jocko ? You and him do n't want me to know what you 're sayin ' , I know . " " We are old friends , Dick , " said DeSam . " It is easier for us to talk in French , non ? " " It do n't make me no never-the-mind , " grumphed Hauser . " If you and him want to talk that gibberish , it 's right fine with this old coon . " DeSam ignored Hauser , who began unloading the dugout . " This whiskey you sent me will buy many furs , " said DeSam . " I do n't give a Spanish curse about furs , " said Montez . " I am after bigger game . " " Ah , Lemuel Hawke , the greenhorn . You have been tracking him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in this country . The trails criss and they cross and they lead into bad places . It is not a place for trackers . You follow the river , she takes you where they must go . Everybody , he follows the river . You want this man , eh ? " " He murdered my brother . His life must pay for Jack 's . " " That is one way to look at it , my friend . " " There is another ? " " You do not care about the furs , but the beaver skin is money . This Hawke , he has no money . Let him get the furs . When he comes to trade or sell to the bourgeois , you kill him and take what he has . Then you have the revenge and you have the money . "  | " Killing the two pigeons with one stone , eh , Jocko ? " " Revenge lasts but a moment , no ? The money lasts a little longer . " Montez laughed drily . " Besides , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said DeSam . " What you say ? " " The boy , Morgan . I do not think he will be a camp-keeper , that one . He will trap . He will get the furs , too . You take them . " " Jocko , Lafitte could learn something from you . " " Ah , that is so , " said DeSam , his chest swelling . " Maybe you are right , " said Montez . " Maybe I will catch this Hawke when he has something to give me . " " You will probably have to kill the boy , too . " " I have already thought to do this . One , two , it makes no difference . " " As long as they are not together when you do it , " DeSam said . " What is this you say ? " " I think they will both fight hard if they are together . It would be two against the one , non ? You shoot them like the turkey . First one , then the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , that is good , I think . " Jocko made a gobbling sound . Both men laughed . Nearby , where the Nemeha River flowed into the Missouri , men dipped buffalo-hide pouches into the lesser river 's depths , bringing forth water for the cooking fires . Clouds in the western skies glowed with an apricot tinge . A prairie wind  | blew warm and sweet from the west , redolent of tall grasses and sugar in the stems , tasting of summer flowers . The days were sweet except when it rained or the squalls rose up on the Missouri , driving the men to shelter . The nights , most of them , were just as sweet under fair skies strewn with stars , a gibbous moon gliding like a silent wraith 's eye across silver-shadowed velvet . Morgan wondered at the change in the country , the sights of strange birds and the tracks of unknown animalsthe badger , the prairie chicken , the coyote . Morgan hated unpacking the mules every night , packing them back up the next morning when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumbing grease on raw patches worn by rope and leather , on wounds caused by the constant rubbing of the panniers against their hides . Bone-weary , his head still spinning images of the sights he had seen that day , he crawled into his blankets and let the tiredness seep out while he watched the stars , trying to detect their faint movement . He smelled the buffalo chips , the reek of a skunk , the fetid stench of beasts he had never seen . When at last he slept , he dreamed of beaver and elk , of mountain goats and furry things shining on a rainbow-colored hill deep in the Rockies . Another night he dreamed of the buffalo bones they had seen that day , still a-wonder at their size and multitude . At one place , he suddenly noticed that the skulls were all facing toward the east . " Injuns hold that the buffler is some kind of special animal , made just for them . They thank ' em when they kill ' em and promise to feed their kin when they die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Morgan . " They turn them skulls so the spirits can see how they treated ' em after they kilt ' em . " It was very spooky for Morgan to hear this from Sisco . He felt as if he was riding through a graveyard and could almost feel the spirits of the buffalo in the air . The Indians were strange people ; they knew things that nobody else did . Morgan noticed that the bluffs along the river had changed , lost their trees . Now , they were grassy and stark against the skyline . The air had a dryness to it , beating warmly against his face . The land was an ocean of grass as far as he could see and sometimes the silences filled his ears like whispers of far-off waves seething on a seashore . There were times when he felt swallowed up by the country , lost in it . He knew they had come a long way , would go a lot further before they came to the beaver ponds in the mountains . He felt hopeless some days and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wished , at odd moments , in the silence of his mind , that they would see a road , or a house , a person waving to them . When these wavery , half-formed images appeared , he felt smothered by a powerful homesickness , a deep sense of loss and a fear of never returning to civilization . He wanted a girl to talk to , someone to touch , to hold him , to say hello or ask him how he was feeling . He had to take deep breaths and put such thoughts from his mind , for they were fearsome thoughts , dark and foreboding , as if something terrible would happen to him and no one would ever know that he had left the earth . No one would ever find his grave or his bones , and if they did , it would not matter , for no one would know that he had wandered into the wilderness and died . Worse , no one would care . Patch and Looking Loon led them over old game trails ,  | mysterious highways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of the big river . Morgan derived some comfort in knowing that living creatures had passed by and that , probably , other men had hunted the creatures and eaten them and then gone on living . They swam in blue lakes , rode past a few silent graves of unknown men that pulsed with meaning for young Hawke . The graves had no markers and Patch did not know their names . Morgan felt himself being drawn deeper and deeper into a strange land with loud eerie silences , endless skies and deep nights when the sky was black and sparkling with winking stars , cold and distant , mockingly quiet in a hushed ocean of space . " That be the Big Sioux River , " said Patch , one day . " We 've been makin ' good time . Likely see buffler any day now . " Morgan looked around for any signs of buffalo . He saw only a young killdeer trying to take flight , the last of its baby-down clinging to its wings , the orange fuzz glowing with sunlight . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffalo , piles of dung , some fresh , that littered the trail for miles . " Might be we 'd better bunch up some , " Patch told Lem and his son . " Where they 's buffler , they 's Injuns . " " Where are the buffalo ? " asked Morgan . Patch shrugged . " They 's liable to be anywheres . This is fresh sign . They been here . They come and go . And , if they 're in a hurry , they do n't care what 's in their way . " That night , they made no fire and camped well away from the junction of the James and the Missouri rivers . Patch explained that they were deep in Indian country and needed to stay quiet and listen to every sound . " You might hear a bird what ai n't no bird , " he told the Hawkes . Morgan stayed awake a long time , listening to every night  | 3 sound . He finally closed his eyes , fell asleep in the soft wash of silence . Toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled out of his blankets , grabbed his rifle from force of habit . He groped blindly in the dark for his possibles pouch and powder horns . The ground shook and there was a distant rumbling , like muffled salvos of thunder . Morgan 's throat tightened in fear and his stomach quivered with a sudden spasm . " Pa , " he shouted , breaking the constriction in his throat , " earthquake ! " " Be quiet , " said Lem , a disembodied voice in the thick pitchblende of night . Morgan 's senses clamored to make sense of the sounds and the tremors in the earth . He strained his eyes trying to see in the darkness . He saw only dark shapes , drew in dust through his nostrils , tasted grit in his mouth . He breathed in the thick aroma , tried to isolate it . It was like nothing he had ever smelled before , an invisible steam , thick and gamey . " Steady , son , " whispered Patch , so close to Morgan that when the youth turned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it ? " asked Morgan . " Buffler , " grunted Patch . " Listen . " The rumbling sound grew louder until it was a thunder in Morgan 's ears . The dust in the air thickened . The dawn sky paled as a milky light bleached the eastern horizon and the streak along the skyline spread . Morgan saw the dust hanging in the air like a smoky cloud . " Get your mules packed , your horses saddled , " Patch said to the Hawkes . " We do n't want them bufller to trample us . " Morgan 's blood surged at his temples . He heard the pounding of his heart beneath the low rumbling of the distant herd .  | Lem stepped to his son 's side . " Stay close , " he said . " Let 's catch up those mules . " " Feels like that earthquake back in Kentucky , " said Morgan , as they headed for the feeding mules . The animals were dim shapes in the pale dawn light . " But Patch says it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending down to untie a hobble . " Where we goin ' , Pa ? " Morgan found the other mule and grabbed its trailing halter rein . " Either away from ' em or right close , I reckon , " said his father . As the sky lightened , father and son worked faster , loading the panniers onto the pack mounts , stringing rope through the 0-rings . Within fifteen minutes , they had their horses saddled . " Check your priming pan , " Lem said to Morgan . " Already did , Pa . " Lem grabbed the lead rope from his son . " I 'll pull the mules , son . You stay right close . " The two climbed into their saddles . A moment later , Patch rode up , his flintlock laid across his pommel . Morgan thought he looked different , and as the trapper turned toward the east , Morgan saw that Sisco had smeared his face with dirt . Looking Loon loped up , his rifle hanging from a thong looped around one of two saddle horns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patch . " But this be Pawnee country . That herd might be chased or it might be running towards somethin ' . No way to tell , rightly . But , we got to be mighty careful . If you shoot a shaggy , stay with it until we can skin it out . " Patch paused . " I declare , this coon 's mouth is plumb waterin ' . " Morgan laughed nervously . " Where are they ? " he asked . " Off yonder , five miles or so , I calcalate . " " They sound close . " p 155 " If they was real close , you could n't hear me a-talkin ' , son . You 'll know when we get onto them . " They rode through dust thick as rain , toward the sound of the running herd . Morgan did n't see how there could be that many animals in the whole world . Patch did n't hurry , but followed behind Looking Loon , who kept his horse at an easy walk , as if he had time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears and he fingered the trigger guard of his flintlock , eager to see a buffalo through the veil of dust and bring it down with a lead ball . He wondered if they would see Indians , Pawnee or Sioux , maybe Blackfoot . He lost sight of Looking Loon , then Patch disappeared , too . It was then that Morgan realized that he was deaf to all but the sound of the huge surging herd . It was like standing under a pounding waterfall , like being in a cave high on a hill where the thunder boomed and echoed until you were inside the thunder and the thunder was inside your head . " Pa , " he croaked , trying to keep his voice from shrilling to a high pitch . " Pa , " he called again , more loudly . But Lem had disappeared into the dust and Morgan had no bearings . It was as Patch had said : nobody could hear him now , even if he shouted . He could feel the herd 's hoofbeats through the ground and through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel the earth shaking under him , making his hair stand on end . Morgan 's horse balked , tried to turn away from the herd . " Boots , dang you . " The horse danced in place for a moment , then stepped forward in a slow , sidling gait . Boots turned his head and shook it vigorously . The horse 's eyes were wide , the whites as bright as boiled hen 's eggs .  | Morgan felt a rush of air against his face . At first , he thought it was from the unseen buffalo , but the breeze freshened and he knew it was the morning wind , rising off the earth . He saw his father 's back , then , dimly beyond , the shapes of Patch and Looking Loon . The dust wavered , then wafted to the southwest and lifted so that he could see a long way . The sun 's rim slid above the eastern horizon . Then Morgan saw a sight he would never forget . A dark wave undulated like a shaken blanket , rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what it was , for he had never seen anything like it . He realized , a moment later , that he was looking at a vast migration of buffalo and when he took his eyes off the main body of the herd , he saw individual animals , with their shaggy humps , their oversized heads , horns sprouting from curly tangles of wooly hair . Then they swung toward him . Boots tried to back away , but Morgan dug his heels in the horse 's flanks and yanked down on the reins . Ahead , Lem and Patch were halted , his father leaning over , listening to something the trapper was saying . A few yards from the two men , Looking Loon waited in silence , watching the herd stream by like a river gone mad . Suddenly , Boots swung around , fighting the bit . " You ornery cuss , " said Morgan . Then , his face went white and he froze , letting the horse have his head . Several buffalo sheered off from the main herd and , led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard his father shout something , but he could n't hear the words over the clamor of the herd . Boots bucked and fishtailed , jerking Morgan out of the saddle . Morgan 's hand gripped his rifle . He landed with a thud square on his butt as the horse galloped away in panic .  | The giant bull , followed by dozens of bellowing buffalo , changed course and headed straight for the downed youth . For a frozen second , Morgan thought he must have landed in hell and the devil was bearing down on him , steam jetting from his nostrils , eyes black as anthracite.  | More and more of the shaggy beasts left the main body of the herd , following the lead of the huge errant bull . From their vantage point , Lem and Patch could see the stream of bison clearly , dozens of others following blindly after its maverick leader . " What in hell is that out front ? " asked Lem . " That 's the biggest bull buffler I ever seed , " breathed Patch with a reverence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scrambling to his feet , saw that there was no place to run . He glanced down at his lock , saw that his fall had jolted the flint loose ; it had slipped sideways inside the leather and hung crooked in the gooseneck cock . He jammed the flint back in the jaw as he rose to his feet , but he knew it was still not square . He thought it would probably shatter when he pulled the trigger . The buffalo bull was no more than fifty or sixty yards from p 159 him , shrinking the distance at a nerve-grating pace . There was no time to bring the rifle to his shoulder and take aim . Morgan gritted his teeth , swung the rifle to bear on the bull and cocked the hammer . He prayed silently that the powder in the pan was still dry as he slapped the frizzen in place with his thumb . He thought of the sight on the end of the barrel , saw it lined up at the bull 's chest . When the charging animal was ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pan , peppering Morgan 's face . He did n't even feel the heat . White smoke and flame belched from the muzzle , obscuring the charging bull and the other buffalo from his view . He turned and began to run , bore to his right , in the opposite direction the herd was running . Patch and Lem both raised their rifles at the same time when they saw Morgan fall . " I 'll take the big bull , " said Patch . " You try and drop the cow directly behind it . " They each took aim . Just as Morgan fired his rifle , Lem squeezed off a shot . He did not hear the report from Patch 's rifle , and a cloud of flour-white smoke mingled with his own , so he knew the old trapper must have fired at the same time . " Got him , " said Patch , triumphantly . " I ca n't see a thing , " said Lem . " Me , neither . Not no more . " " Where 's Morg ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of buffalo turn back in toward the main herd slightly , and as the smoke cleared , they saw Looking Loon riding hard toward the place where they had last seen Morgan . " Load it back up fast , " said Patch , pouring powder down the barrel of his rifle . " I got to get to Morgan , " said Lem. p 160 " You better have something to shoot , then . We got us trouble , son . " Lem heard it then , the high-pitched yelps , the ki yi yi yi of many voices . The hairs on the back of his neck stiffened and he brought his powder horn to his mouth , bit the stopper and pulled it free of the spout . His hand trembled as he shook powder into his rifle barrel . He had no idea how much powder he had poured , but he let the horn dangle and fingered a ball and patch from his possibles pouch . Out of the corner of his eye , he saw Sisco ramming his own ball down with his wiping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loading . Patch rode off , toward the place where Looking Loon had gone , leaving Lem to finish seating the patch and ball . The cries of the Pawnee hunters rose and fell in the thunderous roar of thousands of hoofbeats . Lem heard no gunshots , figured the Indians must be hunting with bows . He could see only buffalo as he rode toward the place he had last seen his son . " Morgan , " he called and knew that his voice was lost in the din of the passing herd . He dodged a lone cow , its hump bleeding from a single arrow that jutted from its hide , waggling like a feathered semaphore . He rode through patches of blowing dust , smelling of buffalo and trampled grasses , plowed earth and mangled flowers . He saw the big bull , lying dead on its side , its blue tongue lolling from its mouth , dark blood streaks drying on its shaggy coat , its great head cocked at an angle , eyes shiny glass , smoked up from death . A dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all with different markings , in various colors , on their shafts . Strips of rosy flesh hung in tatters from one of its black horns . Lem stared at the hulk , measured it in his mind , weighed it . His facial muscles pinched in a look of amazement . His mouth  | went slack . He saw no sign of Morgan , felt a slight wash of relief that his son did not lie dead underneath the enormous bison . " Over here , " called Sisco . Lem saw the cow he had shot . It had veered off its course and gone several yards behind the bull . Next to it , on the ground , he saw Morgan . With a heart that felt as if it was sinking through his chest , he rode up on Patch , who was kneeling next to Morgan . " The boy 's all right , " said Sisco . " Got him a knot on his head the size of a quail 's egg . " Lem dismounted . He and Patch helped Morgan to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms . Lem reached out to break his fall , but Morgan pushed his father 's arms away . " I 'm just fine , Pa . " " You look kinda peeked to me , " said Lem . " You able to ride ? " asked Patch . Morgan nodded . He ran a patch down his barrel with the wiping stick , began to reload his rifle . " Let me get some vittles off ' ' n that bull and we 'd better skeedaddle . When them Pawnee women come up to skin out the kills , they 'll raise a holler . We 'll have so many Skidi braves on our butts , we 'll think we was hit by a swarm of Georgia hornets . " " Boots run off , Pa , " Morgan said , after Patch ran over to the dead bull . " I know , " said Lem . " You ride with me and we 'll find your horse . " Morgan climbed up behind his father . " He took off thataway , " said Morgan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood alone , reins dangling , as if waiting for its master . Lem rode up alongside  | Boots , and Morgan jumped into the saddle . He leaned forward and grabbed up the reins . Buffalo streamed past like a great surging river , their thundering hooves beating strong in Morgan 's ears . He gaped at them in awe , feeling the immense power they generated , admiring their speed and grace . They did not seem driven , but surged forward of their own volition , kings of the prairie , lords of the earth itself . He wanted to chase after them , ride among them , try and capture the feeling of running before the wind , racing in their midst like one of them . He had the strange feeling that he could become like them , could feel their hearts beating inside his own , feel their muscles and sinew as part of his own body . He felt lightheaded and giddy just looking at this tide of beasts flowing over the prairie like unchained lightning . It was their giant pulse that hammered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his veins ; it was their savage blood flooding his heart like wildfire , pumping through his flesh like volcanic lava . " Morg , come quick , " called Lem . Morgan shook his head free of his wild thoughts , saw his father down on the ground next to Patch . They were both looking at the dead bull 's chest . He rode over , dismounted . " Son , looks like you brought this bull down , " said Patch , pointing to the chest wound . " Them balls in its sides did n't do no more'n scratch his curly hide . " Morgan stared at the hole . Patch stuck his finger through it , grinned . " Mighty fine shot , Morg , " said his father . " Let 's get us some boudoins and cut out his heart and liver , " said Sisco . " Then we best hightail it for other parts . " " Ai n't we gon na get any of his meat ? " asked Lem . " Not if we want to keep our hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no mistaking the look of warning on Sisco 's face . The Hawkes helped Patch turn the buffalo over on its side . As they watched , the old trapper cut through the animal 's belly . He slashed into the dead flesh with brute force , ripped downward toward 's the bull 's tail . Working quickly , he pulled twenty or thirty feet of lower gut out of the bloody maw , cut it near the anus . " Strip out that shit , Morgan , " said Patch , " press it all out best you can whilst I get the heart and liver . Might even take a cutlet or two from under its spine . " Patch handed Morgan the slimy intestines . They slithered through his fingers , fell to the ground . Reluctantly , he picked up the serpentine mass . " Do it over yonder , " said Lem , pinching his nose . Morgan carried the intestines a few yards away , began to work the fecal matter out the cut end . Patch cut the heart free of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then forced the body cavity wider and reached in , began cutting filets , sawing them , slashing them loose . He took one of the kidneys , then fell back , bloody and exhausted . " Best we pack all this up and get to ridin ' , " he gasped . " Tell your son he can finish working the boudoins on the way . " Lem nodded , dazed by all that he had seen . The buffalo still streamed by , but he no longer heard the yips of the Pawnee . " Here , son , " said Sisco . " You take this heart . Be good eatin ' when we can make us a fire . " Morgan took the bull 's heart . It was heavy in his hands , slick with blood , grainy with fat . He stuffed it inside his shirt . It felt slimy against his skin . Patch handed Lem the kidneys , stuffed the filets in a saddlebag . As the three men were mounting up , they heard a sound , then saw Looking Loon racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mane flying . Behind him , three young Pawnee braves chased him hard , yipping and yelling at the tops of their voices . Morgan raised his rifle . " Best not shoot yet , " said Patch . " Could be they 're just funnin ' . Pawnee blood runs hot when they 're a-chasin ' buflier . " " But they might kill Loonie , " said Morgan . " Yep , they might . " Looking Loon ran a straight course for them , then changed direction . Two of the braves followed as if they were pulled along behind him on strings . The third veered slightly to intercept the Delaware if he continued riding in the same direction . " They 're goin ' to catch him , " said Lem . " If you shoot , shoot at the Pawnee horses , " said Patch . " Why ? " asked Morgan . " Might not help . They hold their horses in high favor . But , if we kilt them young bucks , we 'd have Pawnee on our backs clear to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reins , turned his horse once again . He charged the lone brave riding to cut him off . This surprised the other two Pawnee , and they scrambled to change direction . The Delaware jabbed the butt of his rifle at the lone Pawnee and struck him in the chest , knocking him from the back of his pony . The brave somersaulted backward and landed on his feet . He shook his bow at Loonie , who wheeled his horse in a tight circle . " Let 's shoot them two horses out from under those bucks , " said Patch , bringing his rifle to his shoulder . Morgan had already taken aim on one of the braves . He lowered his sights , led the horse and squeezed the trigger . The ball struck the pony behind its right foreleg , smashing through ribs , tearing up arteries , shattering veins . The animal 's p 165 forelegs crumpled . The brave flew over the pony 's head , landed in a crumpled heap a few yards from the stricken mount . Patch shot the other brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards , then fell over , pinning the Pawnee 's leg underneath . Morgan heard a bone snap . The Pawnee 's face was expressionless and Morgan wondered at that . The pony was kicking all four legs , trying to regain its footing . Morgan was already reloading his rifle when Looking Loon caught up with them . The Indian looked at Morgan , grinned . He made the sign of a man wearing a belt . Morgan dropped his head , remembering . The buffalo bull 's intestines were wrapped around his waist like a sash , forgotten in the excitement . The bull 's heart bulged inside his shirt , staining the fabric with its blood . " Let 's light a shuck , " said Patch , spitting a fresh ball and spit-soaked cloth patch down his barrel . He rammed the wiping stick down as he prepared to ride away . Looking Loon spoke to Patch in sign . Morgan could make out some of it . The Delaware was talking about mounted men hunting , and he was indicating the Pawnee were close . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled his mount to the north . But their way was blocked . The herd had split and buffalo were streaming in all directions , scattering like quail before an unseen threat . Patch halted , and Looking Loon began talking to him in sign . Morgan watched as buffalo streaked past them , veering sharply when they saw the four riders in their path . " What do we do now ? " Lem asked Patch . " Looking Loon says that Pawnee split up this herd . Injuns 'll be ridin ' all through both main bunches , chasin ' after strays . " " So ? " " So , it looks like we 're caught in the middle . " " I do n't see no Pawnee , " said Lem stubbornly. p 166 " Pa , look , " said Morgan . " You boys hold steady now , " warned Patch . Lem twisted in the saddle , saw what Morgan had seen . Five Pawnee braves rode toward them from different directions . They met up about three hundred yards away and fanned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Looking Loon made several signs to Patch . Sisco nodded . " Yep , " said Patch aloud . " That 'll be the big chief hisself , Little Antelope . And , that 's his onliest son with him , that lean one wearin ' three eagle feathers in his hair . He be called Turtle . " " You know them ? " asked Morgan . " Sorta . " " They do n't look too friendly to me , " said Morgan . " They ai n't friendly at all , " said Patch . " Just hold back your water , boys . Do n't do nothin ' lessen I say to . " Little Antelope rode up to the dead and gutted bull , halted his horse . The other braves with him stopped at that place , too . The Pawnee chief looked down at the bull . He leaned over and broke off the arrow that was sprouting from its hump . He looked at it , then showed it to the other braves with him . They each grunted . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his voice pitched low . " He ca n't claim it , " said Morgan , sharply . " Keep quiet , " whispered Lem . Little Antelope rode around the bull while the other Pawnees sat their horses , none of them moving . They all stared at the four interlopers . Morgan saw that their faces were smooth , their features sharply defined . They wore only breechclouts and moccasins , carried knives and iron war hatchets , arrows in quivers slung over their backs . Each had an arrow nocked to his bowstring . p 167 Little Antelope began speaking , not to anyone in particular , but loudly , almost shouting . Morgan tensed , although he could not understand a word . He looked at Patch out of the corner of his eye . Patch sat his horse calmly , did not even twitch . Finally , the Pawnee chief rode toward them , stopped a few paces away . He pulled his arrow free from the string , laid his bow and the loose arrow across his bare legs . He continued speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the giant buffalo carcass several times . Then , he was silent . He glared at the four intruders , as if waiting for an explanation . " He said that this was a mighty bull , " said Patch . " He said the bull has strong medicine . That means it 's somethin ' right special , I reckon . He said he was a-chasin ' it , that he shot an arrer into it and the sting was no more than a gnat 's bite . He wonders who killed the bull with a thunder-stick . " Patch patted his rifle softly . " He wants to know who brought the bull down . " " How come ? " asked Morgan , his mouth dry as the dust he tasted on his tongue . " Du n no , " said Patch . " You tell him , " said Morgan . He drew air in his lungs , thrust his chest out . " You tell him I done it . " " He might not like it none , " said Patch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morgan shot his father a sharp look . " I 'll tell him what 's so , " said Patch . He began to speak in sign . He pointed to young Morgan , then at the bull . He told how Morgan was on the ground and how the bull charged him . He said that the bull tried to kill Morgan , but the boy held his ground and shot the great beast at close range . So close , his hands said , the boy could feel the bull 's hot breath on his face . The Pawnees grunted and made humming sounds in their throats .  | Little Antelope spoke again . His hands interpreted his words . " He says that you have strong medicine , Morgan . He wonders what you have inside your shirt . " Morgan withdrew the bull 's bloody heart , held it aloft . The Indians muttered in approval . " You take a bite of that heart and then offer it to Little Antelope , " said Patch . " That will show him you were the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store in respect . " " It 's raw meat , " said Morgan . " It might help us keep our hair , " Patch advised . " Go on , Morg , " said Lem . " Take a little bite , chew it good and swaller it . " Morgan braced himself , took a bite from the tip of the heart . He chewed the tough meat , held out the heart toward Little Antelope . The chief rode up , took the heart , bit into the middle of it . He wrenched loose a chunk of meat , seemed to swallow it whole . Little Antelope handed the heart back to Morgan , touched a fist to his chest . He rode up close , reached out , put his hand on Morgan 's rifle . Then , he looked at the medicine horn hanging at Morgan 's side . He picked it up , looked closely at the markings . " You have strong medicine , " the Pawnee signed while Patch interpreted . " You are young , but you are strong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not hunt here anymore . We will take the meat of this great bull and it will make us strong . You eat the heart and you will be strong . Go . " " I reckon we better go , " said Patch . He signed to Little Antelope that they were leaving . Little Antelope wheeled his horse and returned to the dead bull . He called loudly and women and children waddled up , carrying knives and hatchets . The Pawnees rode away , showing off their horsemanship ,  | before attacking the herd . Morgan watched Turtle ride alongside a large cow and shoot an arrow into it . The cow staggered and finally dropped . Morgan shook his head in wonderment . The four men caught up the pack animals and headed north , away from the path of the buffalo herd . Morgan saw the animals get smaller and smaller until they just blurred together and then became a thin line on the horizon that finally disappeared .  | They rode a great distance over gradually changing terrain and camped that night in strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if by a gigantic plow . They seemed to be , Morgan thought , on the edge of a dead world . There were no trees and the grass was sparse . They seemed to have lost the river somewhere in their travels . In the distance , Morgan saw great heaps of rolling land , and every so often , like beacons on a desolate landscape , small peaks that seemed like bumps on the land , hints of the great mountains beyond . Patch selected a campsite on high ground . There , they could see for miles in every direction . " What happened to the river ? " Morgan asked . " We 'll pick it up again , tomorry , " said Sisco . " Safer here for the time bein ' . " p 171 That night , they feasted on buffalo filets and boudoins , the rest of the bull 's heart and liver , and the kidneys . Sisco made a white pudding from the boudoins , what the French called poudinge blanc . He added the filets and kidneys to the stew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred in water enough to cook it through . They all ate portions of the heart raw at Sisco 's urging , both in celebration of the kill and as part of some ancient ritual Sisco told them about . " Injuns put great store in eating the hearts of animals they kill'specially if the animal is big and pow'rful and strong and brave . They say it gives ' em good medicine . " " This is a feast , " said Morgan . " You can still taste the shit in them boudins , " said Lem . " That 's what gives ' em their flavor . " Patch laughed . " Buffalo shit 's good for lots of things . " " Like what ? " asked Morgan , chewing the crackle-crisp boudins . " When their droppin 's is dry , you can use ' em to make fires . Boudins is prime vittles to a mountain man . " After that , Morgan ate more than his share . Looking Loon looked pained when the last scrap was gone . " That Injun dearly loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation . " You ask me , " said Morgan dryly , " he 'll eat anything . " Lem and Sisco laughed . Morgan thought about his dog , Friar Tuck , and wished , once again , that Looking Loon would choke on a piece of meat . The next morning , they stayed in camp , mending clothes , sewing broken harnesses , trimming hooves on mules and horses . When Patch said it was time to go , they mounted up and rode westward , coming upon the Missouri River in mid-afternoon . " Not far to go now , " said Patch . p 172 " Where to ? " asked Lem . " You want to see old Silas Morgan ? " " I reckon I would . " " We might just find the Crow , then . That 's likely when he 'll be found . " " Are them Crows friendly ? " " Sometimes . Hard to say . " Lem said nothing , but Morgan noticed his father was especially edgy the next few days . The land kept changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so gradual it might have been a trick of the eyes . One day , Morgan saw the broken country , the flatness all rumpled and gouged by gullies and washes and the hills jagging up , and beyond , so far away he had to strain his eyes to see , a long blue mass that he thought must be the mountains . They saw more buffalo , and elk , deer and antelope , often grazing on the same plain in fairly close proximity . Morgan was curious about the antelope . " Tastes like goat 's meat , " said Patch . " But , if that 's all you got , you can eat ' em . " He remembered Dick Hauser telling him the same thing at Spanish Jack 's in St. Louis . But he still had n't tasted antelope meat and he wanted to find out for himself if the meat did taste like goat . Morgan chased after several antelope , but they were too fast for his horse . Patch watched him with amusement . " You ai n't never gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , how then ? " asked Morgan . " You got to trick ' em . They 're curious critters . You can sneak up on ' em , to within a couple a hunnert yards , and lie down on your back , wiggle your legs in the air . They 's some who ties a cloth to their rifles and waggle it like a flag . The p 173 goats ' 11 come up close . Injuns , they wear antelope skins and steal up close enough to shoot ' em with arrers . But , you chase ' em like you 're a-doin ' and they 'll run circles around you , laughin ' all the time . " Morgan gave up trying to shoot an antelope , but he vowed that someday he would try one of Patch 's tricks . And , one day , the mountains were there , a dark mass on the morning horizon . The sight caught Morgan by surprise . " Are them the mountains ? " he asked Patch . " Sure as rain . " " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chile . " " When will we get there ? " " Why , ' fore you know it , " said Patch . And so it was . One day , they could see the mountains clearly , and Morgan would ever after remember the thrill of seeing their snowcapped peaks , their sawtooth ridges . They seemed born of the blue sky itself , huge muscular giants basking in the golden sunlight , distant , mysterious , alluring . Even his father grew excited as they drew closer to the Rocky Mountains . " That 's where we 'll make our fortune , son . " " You think so , Pa ? " Lem grinned so wide his face fairly shone . Jocko DeSam did not like Josie Montez . The man was full of hate . He was not a trapper . He had been useful for the smuggling , but now he was like a stray dog that would n't go away . Worse , DeSam could n't even kick him . For Josie was a dog that would bite , not tuck its tail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He constantly asked questions about Lemuel Hawke and his son , Morgan .  | " Where do you think this Hawke will go ? " he asked every day , as DeSam paddled in the bow of the canoe . Montez paddled , too , in the stern , but not when he was talking , thinking out loud . For days , DeSam had not known how to answer the Spaniard . Then , he remembered that day when he had first met the Hawkes , back in Nashville . Lem had talked about his friend who trapped in the mountains , a man DeSam knew , or at least had seen . Nobody really knew old Silas Morgan . He lived with the Blue Bead People , the Crow , up on the Yellowstone . The mountains were close now . DeSam could almost smell the heady scent of the evergreens , taste the crystal waters of the streams . But he had this Spanish millstone around his neck , this jabbering jay who talked incessantly of killing a man he had seen but once , did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montez , " we will talk , no ? I have the idea . " " You telling me to shut my mouth , Jocko ? " " You talk too damn much , Josie . " Montez laughed . It was like a knife scraping over stone . They dug their paddles in as the river took a wide sweep and then narrowed . The water ran swift in the narrows and corded muscles , swollen veins , stood out on the men 's necks . Their arms were strong from paddling against the current day after day , and they bucked the dugout through the narrows into tamer water , where the swirling pools were almost hypnotic as they scurried by and disappeared . " What is this big idea you have , Jocko ? " asked Montez when he had his breathing back to a steady rate . " I am thinking about it , Montez . " " A good idea ? " " Maybe , eh ? You want this Hawke feller pretty good . " " I want him pretty bad , amigo . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . " He did business with Josie Montez , but he did not like him . A man had very few friends in this country . And , often , he did not pick them . Friends happened , like storms or golden mornings . One did not choose . But one could choose one 's enemies , or those he did not want as friends . Montez was a dangerous man . There were many stories about him and his knife down in New Orleans . Some of the stories had been told by his brother , Spanish Jack . Others were carried up to St. Louis and out to the mountain camps by men who had survived Montez 's knife or pistols . " Well , maybe you will get your chance , Josie . You will have to hunt him , though . " " I am hunting him now , " said Montez . " This may be the easy part , non ? You hunt a man you can not see , a man who is maybe far away . " " He ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knifed the water with his paddle . Ahead , another dugout labored upstream , its men obscured by a cloud of deerflies or river gnats as big as houseflies . " In those big mountains , " said DeSam , " a man can hide forever . " He was thinking about Silas , who lived with those damned Absaroke , the Crow . Married to a squaw , he was more Indian than white now . Jocko had known several such men , and their women never took up the white ways . Old Silas seldom came to the settlements anymore , and then only to buy gewgaws for his woman , whiskey , traps and supplies . He never stayed long , did not frequent the tippling houses in St. Louis . Never talked about his life in the mountains . DeSam had seen him , once , hunting with the Crow , a half dozen of them . It was hard to tell them apart . Silas was just as lean , his skin just as red , darker even than some Crow , and p 176 without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He even spoke the tongue , for DeSam had heard him conversing with his companions in Absaroke . He knew the sign , too . He wondered if he should tell Montez about Silas Morgan , where he might find him . A smile flickered on DeSam 's lips . Maybe the Crow would not like this Spaniard any better than he did . He could picture Montez 's scalp dangling from a Crow lance . The thought gave him pleasure . The sun fell fast in the sky , sank behind the mountains . DeSam put in where several of his brigade had already landed and were setting up camp for the night . He was tired , but elated . Maybe he would get Montez off his back soon . They were not far from the Yellowstone . A few more days and maybe Montez would go looking for Lemuel Hawke and whatever happened would be God 's will . The dugout growled against the sandy shore . DeSam scrambled over the prow , waited for Montez to climb out . Together , they pulled the craft up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouches and goods , and turned it over on its side . " Now , you will tell me your idea , Jocko ? " Montez fixed the Frenchman with hard brown eyes . DeSam looked at the cloud-curdled sky , the setting sun just beginning to tinge the cloud-bellies a salmon-pink . The breeze on the river stiffened , and he knew there would be a chill in that July night . Two more dugouts rounded the bend , headed toward shore . The men in them looked exhausted , their shoulders drooping , their paddles spanking the water listlessly instead of carving in deeply . " I will tell you what you can do , " said DeSam wearily . " Come , we find a place to talk . " Some of the Frenchmen already on shore waved to DeSam , called out obscenities to him . He grinned and waved back . Their faces , even under their thick beards , were bronzed by  | the sun . Halos of flies and gnats surrounded their heads . They had started a cookfire and made it smoky to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of fresh blood . DeSam found a place out of earshot of the other men in his brigade . A small creek wound through a copse of cottonwood and alder thickets , streaming down through gently rolling land , the long grassy hills that buffalo had grazed for centuries . DeSam sat beneath a tree , the sores on his butt long since scabbed over until they were like leather patches on his skin . Montez squatted a few feet away , braced against another tree . Below , they heard the voices of the new arrivals mingling with those on shore , a blend of French and English words of greetings and insults . " This Hawke , " said DeSam , " he has a friend in the mountains . He talks about this man all the time . He will probably look for him and find him . " " Who is this friend ? " " His name is Silas Morgan . Hawke named his son after him . " " Where does this Silas live ? " asked Montez . " He lives with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will surely find Hawke , I think . " DeSam described Silas Morgan the way he remembered him . He said that he was a few years older than Hawke and that he was more savage than civilized . " Where do these Crow live ? " asked Montez . " The band he is with , I think , hunt along the Yellowstone , sometimes up on the Musselshell . But , I have seen them on the Judith , as well . They are wanderers , like all these tribes , hunters who follow the buffalo . They hunt the buffalo now and then will trap the mountains for furs when the snows come and the beaver coats they shine and become thick . " " You will go with me , help me to find this Silas , Jocko ? " p 178 " No , I do not want anything to do with the Crow . " " They are friendly , are they not ? This Silas lives with them . " " They are a good people . The women are very beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blackfeet and they do not like the Crow . The Crow do not like white men much . Some do , some do n't . " " How will I find these rivers ? " asked Montez . " I will draw you a map and you must leave the Missouri at the Musselshell and go south to the Yellowstone . They may be hunting on the Big Horn , which would be to the east . If they are not on those rivers , then you must double back and look for the Crow on some of the creeks . There are many creeks and they camp on all of them . " " I will be alone , " Montez mused . " No , there are those who trap those mountains where the rivers are born . You will find men who know where the Crow are . The Major will trap those same streams . He 'll put trappers all through that country , you bet . " " And where will you go , Jocko ? " " I do not like to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marias . " You will trade with the Blackfeet ? " " I will trade the whiskey for furs , " admitted DeSam . " When do we reach this Musselshell ? " " In a week or two . I would bet a day 's trapping that you will follow Lem up that river . Old Patch , he traps the Absarokes and he trades with the Crow . " " Bueno , " said Montez . " I will find Lem Hawke and kill him before the snow flies . " " Good fortune , then , " said DeSam in French . " Suerte , " said Montez . But he meant it for himself , for he  | would need all the luck he could get to find Lem Hawke and put a blade to his throat . Angus MacDougal and his keelboats struck the Platte River and went as far as they could go before the water became so shallow they dared not risk further voyaging . He sent the last keelboat back downriver , set off overland on horses , with the mules in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running out of summer and he was losing time . The Laramie range loomed to the south , reminding them of how small they were , how insignificant was their place in such a grand country . The men no longer sang the boatmen 's songs , but rode westward with determination , if not enjoyment . Angus loved every moment of it , for he saw beyond , saw the riches , the wealth the men could only dream about . They worked for him , for the Company , and they would never have more than enough money to squander in a day or a week after the season . Two men had drowned that morning , stepping off a sand bank into a deep hole . The water was low , but swift , and they were swept away before anyone could save them . It was too bad , but the party had to forsake finding their bodies . There was a sullenness among the others following the accident , but Angus knew they would soon forget . Both were older men with not much experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that maddened gleam in their eyes and he thought they might make it through a winter . At least they were not Scotsmen , he mused . One was a German named Ludwig something or other . The other had an English nameWilson , or Miller , he could not remember . Like so many others who came out West , they would leave no  | trace . Their families would probably never know they had died . For certain they could not know until he had gotten back to St. Louis next year and filed his report with the company . He would write about the incident in his journal that night after supper , when he was in his shelter with his candle and his books . Perhaps , Angus thought , he would play the pipes tonight , a dirge for the two who had died . It might not help the men 's mood , but it would help his own . He needed to hear the skirling in his ears , feel the moan of the pipes in his blood . He needed that reminder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trail trampled by buffalo , following Fletcher Bancroft , in the lead . Angus swabbed sweat off his forehead with a large handkerchief and cocked an eye at the setting sun . The clouds to the west were turning peach , rows of them flocked together like tattered batting . The river was streaked with gold and copper , veins of pale silver eeling through dark ripples , glazed at the edges by purple borders where the banks threw wavering shadows . They must make camp soon , he thought , for the sun fell quickly behind those mountains , leaving cold ashes in the sky , the lingering dust of the day hanging like gossamer shrouds over the distant horizon . Fletcher Bancroft shifted in his saddle , looked back at Angus , as if reading his mind . Angus nodded , stuck his handkerchief back in his pouch . There was no breeze and it was hot , dry as last year 's mud dauber 's nest . A man named Tom Sheets turned and looked back , too . He had known one of the men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . Once the two went under , though , they never came back up . Angus did n't ignore Sheets ; he just looked right through him , as if he was n't there . Tom had wanted to p 181 find the bodies , bury them . A singular waste of time in MacDougal 's mind . Sheets turned , said something to Ralph Parsons , who was riding alongside him . Ralph was Ernie 's brother . Parsons nodded . Ahead , where the land made a wide bowl , Fletch turned right , following a shallow ridge . He stopped at its pinnacle and dismounted . The men following him surrounded that central point and picketed their horses , unloaded their gear , leaving scattered piles far enough apart so that they could set up their shelters for the night . Fletcher began barking orders . A half dozen men brought up the pack train , rode some distance past the camp and started setting up a rope corral . Trask and Parsons waited until Angus caught up with them . " Major , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ought to lay up a day and get some rest . " " He 's right , Major , " said Parsons . " We must 've come fifty miles today . " " More like thirty , " said the Major . " A good stretch of the legs . " " Forty , " said Sheets . " At least . " " We got a late start because of those two men frolicking in the river , " said MacDougal . " That cost us five miles . We 've got less than an hour of sunlight left . I could have gotten back that five miles and you both would have cursed me when you could n't find your shitrags in the dark . We 're running late on flat ground , so stop your bellyaching . " " My butt feels like a chunk of rock , " said Sheets . " Soak your butt in the North Platte , " said Angus coldly . " Major , we 're all plumb tuckered , " said Parsons . " The men been prickly as nettles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like we have , grumblin ' and gripin ' . " " And did this do them all some good ? " asked the Ma- p 182 jor . " Did it shorten the miles ? Did it soothe your feet , Sheets ? " " Well , now there you go , Major , a-twistin ' everything up into knots , " said Sheets . " What the hell difference does a goddamned day make ? " Angus had put down such minor rebellions before . He enjoyed it , actually . It strengthened his position as a leader . He could feel the th ender rising in his chest , the thunder that every great orator possessed . A shame to waste it on two whining men , but they had been the ones to speak up , not the others , who were already making camp . Perhaps it was just as well that he had only these two to contend with at the moment . He felt like shooting them both , treating them like mutineers on the high seas . The Major was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reminded , once again , of Jacques Decembre 's defectionthat damned Jocko DeSam , who fancied himself a booshway . It was downright insulting . He and that riffraff , the Hawkes , would regret not working in his brigade . One way or another , Angus would have their hides . And if Sheets and Parsons did n't back down quick , he 'd skin them , too . " Gentlemen , " MacDougal said coolly , " I sense that you possess little appreciation for the task ahead of us . We 've a great deal of ground to cover and you 'll want the best beaver streams for yourselves . Keep your grouses to yourselves or you 'll get the poorest grounds to trap , I assure you . " Sheets opened his mouth , started to say something . Parsons reached out and grabbed his arm to stop him from making things worse . Nobody ever won an argument with the Major . MacDougal stared Sheets down , until Tom averted his eyes and hung his head . Parsons saw the look on the Major 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bastard , " muttered Sheets as he rode away . He could feel the Major 's eyes burning into his back . " I guess we ai n't as tired as we thought , " said Parsons . " I got me a good mind to " But Sheets never finished his sentence . The Major galloped past them , looking as fresh as when they had started out that morning . " Tomorry , " said Parsons , " he 'll log sixty miles in his book , you 'll see . " That evening , the brigade ate badger , geese , turkey and the river furnished their larder with catfish caught on bone hooks baited with earthworms or spoiled jerky . Tom Sheets cussed under his breath all evening long and did n't stop until he crawled into his blankets , but nobody paid him any mind . They knew he was just trying to get over the death of a friend he had made . After the fires were put out , the Major played the pipes for a half an hour in the darkness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly , crushed by the terrible loneliness they felt in that vast , desolate land , conscious that they were dependent on the Major for their livelihood . And that was just how Angus MacDougal wanted them to feelevery man jack of them .  | Morgan Hawke gazed at the distant horizon so long his father thought he must be in a trance . " I reckon them are the mountains yonder , " said Morgan . " Or just more hills like we been seein ' and ridin ' through . " " I reckon we 're gettin ' close , " said Lem . " Do n't appear to be too big . Probably no bigger'n the Cumberlands or the Smokies . " " Them ai n't the Rockies , " said Patch , overhearing father and son . " Just more hills , like you say , Morgan . " Looking Loon ranged far ahead of them , glad to be free of leading the pack mules , which he had done all morning . They had journeyed south after coming upon a huge bend in the Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lake . Patch led them south on a river he said ran out of the mountains . " Broad , ai n't it ? " said Lem . " This be the Musselshell , " said Patch . " We 'll run up it , see if  | we ca n't find us a Crow what knows where your friend Silas be . " " I wonder how Silas is doing ? " Lem mused aloud . Everyone but Lemuel called him " old " Silas . Even Hawke 's ex-wife Roberta had called him that , too . He wondered why . Silas was n't much older than he . But , he looked old . Always had , ever since Lem had known him . Maybe Silas was old , now that he thought of it . Forty-five or so . Could n't be fifty yet , could he ? Maybe . Morg had n't been born when old Silas left Virginny to trap beaver and such . And now Morg was all but full growed , so Silas had to be a graybeard . Hell , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a-rushin ' by . Morgan rattled the rope , jerked the mules into motion . Boots stepped out , snatching a tuft of twelve-inch grass from the prairie . Deer broke from cover , rising up from beds in the middle of a wide patch of grass . Their tails flashed golden in the sun and they disappeared , leaving narrow swaths in their wake . The deer were different from the eastern whitetails . They had large ears and seemed bigger , with gray hides , gray as winter wolves in full coat . " They call ' em mule deer , " Patch told him . " ' Cause of those big ears , I reckon . Chunky as hogs , ai n't they ? Mighty fine eatin ' . " They had seen buffalo and antelope every day for the past several weeks , and mule deer way off , standing like sentinals next to timber , or scattering from a waterhole that appeared like a mirage in one of the long shallow valleys in the rolling countryside . Once in a while , they 'd see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffalo were scattered , as if they had been hunted . Patch did not want to hunt them . " This be Crow land , " he said . " And the Sioux , they hunt here ; Cheyenne , too . Sometimes the Blackfeet come down to Jory Sherman 186 fight the Crow . This be dangerous country for whiteskins , and some red ' uns , too . " There were huge prairie dog cities everywhere . Morgan and Lem were fascinated by their numbers , their shrill , highpitched whistles of warning . And , still , there were no mountains , only endless hills where small , scattered herds of buffalo grazed or antelope ran . Yet , there were days when he was sure he could see mountains in the distance . At times , Morgan wondered if they were not just an illusion , a trick of the light . Most often they turned out to be low dark clouds atop distant hills . " When will we get to the mountains ? " Morgan kept asking Patch . " One day you 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'll be touchin ' the sky and have snow on their peaks prettier'n anything you ever saw . " To Morgan , they seemed to be crawling across the prairie . The land was broken along the Musselshell , scarred and welted like the back of a man flayed with a brutal whip . They passed several places where Indians had camped . Morgan looked at the sites with fascination . He could almost see the Indians in his mind . It was thrilling to ride over the places where they had lived . One day , Patch waved them back into a deep gully . Before they descended into the hiding place , Morgan and his father saw the Indians . They were far off and yelling exultantly . They were driving horses with mottled coats , twenty or so . " Flatheads , " Patch explained . " ' Pears they been after the Crow and got ' em some ponies . " " Did they see us ? " Lem asked . " I reckon not . Them bucks are full o ' themselves , braggin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em some horses and scalps . "  | " Why do n't the Crow go after them ? " asked Morgan . Patch shrugged . " Could be the Crow was hurt had , " he said . " Or maybe the Flatheads took all their horses . Injuns is funny . They do n't look on fightin ' like we do . It 's a sport . They make a big to-do about fightin ' , lots of singin ' and dancin ' , and when they do battle , they play it like a game , actin ' brave and strikin ' coup with sticks and warclubs . Do n't make much sense'cept to another Injun . " " Injuns is mighty strange , " observed Morgan . Patch almost laughed . He could tell from the look in Morgan 's eyes that the boy was fascinated by the redmen . " That they be , " agreed Patch . They waited a long time before Looking Loon signed to them that the Flathead had gone their way and were no longer a threat . But Morgan kept looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking Loon rode into camp one evening with a mule deer draped over his horse 's withers . The deer had not been gutted out . Usually , the Delaware made his kill , removed the legs and head , skinned it , butchered the animal and brought the meat back all neatly rolled up in its hide . Blow flies swarmed over the venison , thick as fur on a beaver . These insects had been their constant companions for weeks , attacking the meat from the time they gutted it to when they cooked it and while they ate it . The Delaware began speaking to Patch in sign , his hands moving so rapidly Morgan had difficulty in following him . But he knew that Loonie was talking about Indians and that he was excited . Morgan could n't tell by Loonie 's signs if the Indians were hostile , but at the end of his silent recital , Looking Loon grinned . " Looks like Loonie done found him a bunch of Crow , " said Patch . " He shot two deer , gave ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em we were here . He thinks they 've got a camp somewheres near , up the Musselshell . " " Are these the Crow what Silas took up with ? " asked Lem . " Loonie does n't know the difference ' twixt one tribe or another , but he says one of the Crow is a brave we 've run onto before . Name of Moon Face . I reckon he 's one of the Little Robe clan and that he be one of them with Silas last spring . We done some tradin ' . " " What do we do now ? " asked Morgan . " Sit tight , I reckon . Be the polite thing to do . This is Crow country and we got to ask ' em can we come through , do some trappin ' . " " How soon will the Crow be here ? " asked Lem . " Injuns got to do a lot of talkin ' and studyin ' on a thing before they make up their minds . Kinda like some of them Germans I knowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em none . " " Then we got no worries , " said Lem . " I could n't exactly say , " said Patch . " I 'd see my pan was primed and keep a weather eye cocked . Do n't make no sudden moves , but be ready , case they want to try us on for size . " " Did Loonie say anything about Silas ? " asked Lem . " He told ' em we were looking for Gray Hawkthat 's what the Crow calls your friend . " " And , what did the Crow say ? " " They did n't say yeah or nay . " " Maybe Silas will come with them , " ventured Morgan . Patch shrugged . But the old trapper kept his rifle close and they all checked their pans for dry powder . Morgan touched his flint to see if it was secure in its leather sleeve , tightened the bolt down a notch . Lem rubbed the sweat off his palms , stayed close to a stand of poplar for cover . p 189 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made no move to dress it out . Instead , he sat down and laid his rifle across his lap . He seemed , Morgan thought , to sit there in a trance . Patch set out some tobacco , trade beads and a half dozen iron tomahawks . He laid them on a Hudson Bay blanket , neat and orderly , as if he had done such many times before . " You might want to lay out some goods yourselfs , " Patch said to Morgan and Lem . " Injuns dearly love presents . " They waited for almost an hour before there was any sign of the Crow . Looking Loon was the first to hear the Indians approaching . His hands told Patch the Crow were nearby . " Here they come , " said the trapper . " Just be quiet and do n't get excited . " Let me do the talkin ' . " A half dozen Crow rode boldly into camp . They carried both rifles and bows , but they were not painted . Morgan thought they looked arrogant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shallow breath of stale air from his lungs . The lead Crow looked at the deer on the ground . He was a burly man with dark reddish skin , a handsome face , large straight nose , coal-black hair . He wore a breastplate of small bones , attached together with sinew in straight , horizontal lines . Beads dangled from the feathers that bordered the ornament . He wore a breechclout and beaded moccasins . His rifle was studded with brass tacks . It was a short-barreled flintlock . A single eagle feather dangled from its frontpiece . " I am Lame Bull , " he said in his native tongue . He signed his name to Patch . " You are One-Eye . " Patch nodded , signed that he was a friend . He offered Lame Bull and the others his gifts . He pointed to Lem and Morgan 's blankets .  | " Take , " Patch said in English . The Crow dismounted , strutted around the camp . " This deer should be gutted and hung up , " he said in Crow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he spoke rapidly in both sign and Absaroke . " Why are you here ? Where are you going ? Why do you ride through Crow land ? What are you looking for ? " Patch patiently answered all of his questions , speaking in English for the Hawkes ' benefit , making sign to Lame Bull . " We go to the mountains to trap the beaver for the white man 's shining buttons , " said Patch . " Moon Face there knows One-Eye . These two white faces are father and son . They look for their friend , Gray Hawk . They are from his mother 's country and they have a come a long way to see their good friend . Take these gifts and tell Gray Hawk we are here . " The Crow all seemed to disdain the gifts at first . Moon Face came up to Morgan Hawke and poked a finger in his chest , felt the muscles of his arms . Morgan bristled . " You just hold steady , Morgan , " said Patch . " He do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know you . " Two Crow examined Lem . None of them seemed interested in Looking Loon . The Delaware still sat there , his rifle across his legs , staring into nothingness . The other Crow looked at the mules and examined the horses , opening their mouths . They poked at the panniers , as if trying to see what goods were inside the packs . Morgan found that he could smell the Crow . They had a peculiar odor , a smell of smoke and grease that was very strong . " This one has no tongue , " said Lame Bull , pointing to Looking Loon . " He is not Crow . " " He is a human being from another tribe , " Patch said aloud , making the signs . " He is not white . " p 191 Lame Bull laughed at that . " My eyes can see he is not white , " he signed . " His skin is as dark as mine , but he is very ugly . " " Yes , he is ugly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Great Spirit has given him a brave heart in its place . " Lame Bull and the others laughed again . Then , the Crow began to snatch up the gifts , examining the tobacco and beads , talking among themselves . Moon Face fought over some tobacco and ended up with only a handful . Finally , to Morgan 's relief , Lame Bull made a sign that he could understand . " Bring that deer with you and come with us , " he told Patch . " Well , boys , we 're a-goin ' to the Crow camp , " said the trapper . " How far ? " asked Morgan suddenly . The Crow all looked at him . It grew very quiet . " This one has a tongue , " signed Lame Bull . " Does he also have a brave heart ? " " He kilt the biggest buffler I ever seed when it was chargin ' him . The buffler was bristlin ' with Pawnee arrers . He war n't more'n ten feet away when the boy brought the bull down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse , " said Lame Bull disdainfully . " He was standin ' like he is now . He did n't run . " Morgan read the sign perfectly . His chest swelled slightly . " You do n't need to brag on me , none , " he told Patch . " Injuns like braggin ' , " he replied . " They like it a lot . " Lame Bull called the other braves to him . He spoke in Absaroke for several moments . He did not make sign . Morgan saw that the others were listening intently . Finally , Moon Face and Lame Bull turned toward Patch . " We will return to our people , " said Lame Bull . " We will talk to them and we will smoke . We will take this deer because it belongs to us. " p 192 Patch 's eyes narrowed , but he did not translate . Morgan understood the sign anyway . " We go , " said Moon Face , his hand sign very curt . With that , two Indians lifted the deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bull spoke to them . The Crow mounted up and rode out of sight without uttering another sound . Looking Loon stood up . His hands began to talk rapidly to Patch . Morgan could not follow all of it , but he knew that the Delaware was saying that they should leave before the sun went to sleep . Looking Loon traced a path that would take them wide of the river but loop back toward the mountains . Patch did not reply to Looking Loon . Morgan surprised all of them by speaking to Looking Loon in sign . None was more surprised than his father , but he beamed with pride as he saw the look of approval on Patch 's face . " Why do we run and hide like rabbits ? " he asked . Looking Loon made the sign of a bird and jabbed at his head with a finger , made the circular motion , pulled at his topknot . " The Crow will scalp us . " " How do your eyes see this ? " asked Morgan . " My heart sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argy with him none , " said Patch . " Loonie gets a feelin ' in his gut now and again . He thinks them Crow are up to no good . " " What about you ? " asked Lem . Patch shrugged . " It do n't look too good to me . " " You want to run off ? " Lem asked . " Might be the best thing to do . Did you see Moon Face lookin ' at our packs ? That nigger might not want to trade for somethin ' he can get free . " p 193 " I was hopin ' we might see Silas , " said Lem . " Hell , they might have kilt him , " Patch exclaimed . " I never trusted the Crow much . There 's some as set store by ' em , but I just do n't trust ' em . Me and Loonie are pullin ' out . " " Pa , " said Morgan , " maybe we 'd better go with Patch and Loonie . " " I reckon we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ran fingers through his full beard . He had let it grow ever since they had seen Josie Montez . Morgan wondered if he had done it to hide his identity . If so , it sure had changed his looks . Morgan 's face was clean as a hen 's egg , although he had sprouted a few silken hairs on his chin that he had quickly plucked . He had a little hair on his chest , but it , too , was fine and blond , hardly noticeable . " Let 's get to goin ' , then , " said Patch . " Them red niggers could be back anytime . " " Damn , " muttered Lem . " I sure was hopin ' to see Silas out here . " In less than ten minutes , they had broken camp and were riding a wide loop away from the Musselshell . The sun set quickly , plunging the small party into darkness . Patch kept them all bunched together as they rode blindly on , putting distance between them and the river . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had risen , Patch called a halt . " Do n't unpack nothin ' , " he whispered . " Hobble the horses and mules . Me'n Loonie 'll take the first watch . You boys get some sleep . I 'll wake you in a couple of hours . " " It 's sure dark , " said Morgan , looking at the black sky , the tiny fingernail of moon . " That 's what they call a trapper 's moon , son , " said Patch . " Best time to hunt , catch beaver and such . " " It gives me the williwaws , " said Lem softly . p 194 " Me , too , " said Morgan . " You ca n't hardly see nothin ' . " " Take it as a good sign , " said Patch . " We do n't want to be seen now , do we ? Same as the wild critters what feed at night . Yep , that 's sure enough a trapper 's moon . " " I just hope it bodes well for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out their bedrolls , kept their rifles close by as they made ready for sleep . Morgan stared up into the Stygian sky , stared at the small thin moon . " Must be another month comin ' to an end , Pa , " he breathed . There was no answer . His father was already asleep . Finally , Morgan slept , too . Weighed down by eyelids heavy as stone , he sank into a deep slumber . Two hours later , he was yanked out of sleep . Not by Patch or Looking Loon , but by two Crow braves who jerked him from his bedroll , locked his arms behind him . He knew they were Crow because he could smell them . Morgan heard his father grunt , then saw him roughly handled by three more Crow . " You come , you come , " said one of the Crow in a thickly accented voice . " You speak English ? " asked Lem . " Come , " said the Crow again . Morgan heard a commotion . More Crow approached . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under restraint . " Boys , they found us , " said Patch . " We 're a-goin ' to the Crow camp with these fellers . " " No talk , " said the English-speaking Crow . Morgan felt a sinking feeling as his hands were tied . The Crow put their prisoners on their horses . Morgan knew their p 195 hands , too , were tied . There were at least a dozen Crow , he figured as they rode off . The moon , like a sliver of errant quicksilver , disappeared behind scudding , high-flying clouds .  | The sky lightened slowly under thick gray clouds . Morgan rocked in the saddle , fighting off sleep . His father shook him awake every so often when he began to lean over the pommel . " You 'll fall and break your neck you do n't stay awake , " chided Lem . They had been riding for hours in total darkness . The captives had no sense of where they were , having lost their bearings as soon as the Crow had taken them away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they talk among themselves . Shortly after dawn , the Crow halted at a small stream , deep in woodlands . Many bared their buttocks and defecated on low ground several dozen yards away . Others urinated , spraying the grass with yellow streams . One Crow untied their captives ' hands , motioned for them to pee or shit . After Morgan saw p 197 Patch and Loonie relieving themselves , he did the same . He stared at the Crow , wondering which one had spoken English to them . He did not see Lame Bull , Moon Face , or any of the other Crow they had met the night before . " Are these Crow ? " Morgan asked Patch , when they were back together , their hands retied , guarded by the watchful Crow . " Sure as it gets daylight in the mornin ' , " Patch replied . " Do you know any of them ? " " I reckoned them we saw yesterday war n't Little Robes . From talk I just heard , they were Filth-eaters . These here be Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or maybe they be mixed . They all got names like that , or Sore Lips , **26;0;TOOLONG . " " You understand their tongue ? " Lem asked . " Some . A little . These be talkin ' about that medicine horn of your'n , Morgan . Lookee yonder . " Morgan stared in the direction Patch was pointing . Three Crow were handling Morgan 's possibles pouch , his powder horns . One was examining his rifle , holding it to his shoulder . He felt his stomach jolt with a queasy roll of muscles . It felt as if he had died and was watching Indians paw over his belongings . One of the Crow was holding up Morgan 's medicine horn , speaking to the other two . Others wandered over , looked at the markings on the powder horn . Several spoke excitedly and the one holding the horn traced his forefinger over the symbols engraved in the buffalo horn . " Are they fixin ' to kill us ? " Morgan asked . " They ai n't wearin ' paint and ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . I heard Lame Bull 's name mentioned a time or two in passing . I ca n't figure this bunch out . " p 198 " I do n't like bein ' trussed up like a turkey , " said Lem , " a-waitin ' for one of them savages to slit our gullets . " " I reckon they could have kilt us long before now , " said Patch . " No , they 're a-takin ' us someplace . Could be worse waitin ' for us if they take us to be enemies . " " What do you mean ? " asked Morgan . " Oh , they 's lots of things they can do . Best you not know any of it . " " Bastards , " muttered Lem . Patch said nothing . The Crow stopped looking at Morgan 's personal belongings and the one holding the powder horn barked orders . The prisoners were handled roughly as Crow put them on their horses . Morgan , however , was treated much better . Two Crow helped him onto his horse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Patch . Patch shrugged . The leader motioned for Morgan to ride with him in the lead . Reluctantly , Morgan did as he was told . He looked back at his father , tried to look apologetic . The muscular Crow leader , like most of his followers , had long hair that fell past his waist , smooth skin , dark as highly polished leather . His eyes were dark as agates and shone with the morning light . He seemed not much older than Morgan himself . His moccasins were decorated with dyed porcupine quills , flattened and folded into patterns that formed ancient symbols ; his fringed buckskin shirt was beaded and quilled in bright colors . He wore a single eagle feather dangling from his black hair , just below the left ear . He sat his horse very straight and proud . " I am called Whistling Elk , " the Crow said , suddenly , taking Morgan by surprise . " White man name . " " You speak English . " " Gray Hawk teach Whistling Elk. " p 199 " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go camp . Many tipi . Many Crow . " " Is Gray Hawk there ? " " Gray Hawk say come . Lame Bull come get . " " Why are we prisoners ? " Morgan made sign to show hands being tied with rope . " No run away , " said the Crow . He looked sharply at Morgan to see if his words were believed . " A man do n't take another man prisoner for such a rea-son . " Whistling Elk shook his head as if he did n't understand Morgan . " Damn fuckin ' good , " he said . " Silas teach you that ? " " Silas damn fuckin ' good . " Before Morgan could reply , there was a commotion among the Indians . Their captors made bird calls which were answered from somewhere up ahead . The tweetering sounded back and forth until another band of Crow rode out of the woods to meet them . " Why , there 's Lame Bull , " said Morgan . " And Moon Face . Godamighty . " Lame Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Whistling Elk in Crow . He did not sign with his hands , so Morgan did not know what he said . Lame Bull 's band fell in with the Whistling Elk braves and they rode together until they reached the Musselshell again . Whistling Elk spoke no more to Morgan , but seemed to be looking for something that lay ahead . Morgan heard a horse galloping behind him , turned to see his father riding up from the rear . His hands were no longer tied . " Lame Bull untied us , " Lem said as he slowed his horse to a walk beside Morgan .  | " Whistling Elk there said they did n't want us to run away , " Morgan said . " That his name ? " " He 's the one who speaks some English . I think Silas taught him . " " That 'd be like him . Silas probably speaks Crow , too . " " Where do you reckon they 're takin ' us , Pa ? " " Patch thinks we 're going to a big camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much farther . These Injuns ai n't carryin ' no food and not much water . I 'm plumb parched . " " Me , too , " said Morgan . Whistling Elk turned to the Hawkes . " No talk , " he said . In moments , they rode onto a wide plain where horses grazed , tended by boys . They heard distant shouts and soon a group of young men galloped toward them . Beyond , where the river curved into a half loop , Morgan saw the tops of tipis , their hides stark against the distant mountains , bone white under the gray of the sky . The young braves rode back and forth , showing off Morgan marveled at the way they stayed on bareback ponies while performing all kinds of riding feats . One young man rode his pony backward , another crawled underneath his mount , holding onto its neck with encircling arms . Some ponies wore hair or rope bridles , others had none . A Crow stood up on his pony 's rump and waved to them , grinning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pretty fair riding , " said Lem . " I never saw anything like it , " admitted Morgan . Whistling Elk seemed impervious to the dazzling display of horsemanship , but some of the others in his band began to show off , too . Patch and Looking Loon caught up with Lem and Morgan . p 201 Soon , they saw crowds of women and children streaming from the village . They appeared first as brightly colored objects , then slowly took shape . Ahead of them , on a painted Indian pony , rode a man with a bearded face . " Pa , look , " said Morgan , pointing . " I see him . Looks like Silas , sure enough . " Lem grinned , slapped his thigh . " Is it ? " Morgan asked . " Really ? " " Who else ? " As the man drew closer , he began to wave . Lem and Morgan waved back . " Gray Hawk , " said Whistling Elk , in English . " Damn fuckin ' good . " Silas Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long it took him to reach their column . By then , they were surrounded by hooting and hollering Crow braves , all vying for attention from the Hawkes , Patch and the Dela-ware . " Hoo haw , " said Silas , as he rode up . Morgan had no trouble recognizing him , even though he was barechested and wore only a breechclout , a necklace , a quilled belt with a knife jutting from it , moccasins . " If you ai n't a sight for sore eyes , Lemuel Hawke . And , thar be your boy , Morgan , my namesake sure enough . H0000eeee ! " " Silas , you ai n't changed a bit , " said Lem . Silas rode close to Lem , leaned over and slapped him on the back , his carrious teeth visible through his thick beard . " And , there 's old Patch and his nigger , Loonie . How do , Patch ? " " Silas , you look fit , " said Patch . " I got it sweet , Patch . This old coon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Whistling Elk 's got your medicine horn . You give it to him ? "  | " No , he took it , " Morgan said , scowling . " They tied us up and brung us here . " " Well , " said Silas , " the Crow been a mite skittery lately what with so many white men comin ' in to their country . They got their hands full with other Injun tribes stealin ' their horses and women and kids . Scouts been comin ' in all month tellin ' tales . " " What tales ? " asked Lem . " Keelboats on the Missouri , the Platte . Trappers and traders , a passel of ' em , headin ' toward the Seedskedee and the Popo Agie . " Lem did n't understand a word Silas had said . " That would be the Major and his bunch , " explained Patch . " I figgered . Angus taught me a lot , but he 's a skunk all right . Jocko still trappin ' with him ? " " Not no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill us all . " " Well , now , we got to make some talk when we get you all settled , " said Silas . " I 'll see you get your goods back right quick . You got to watch them Filth-eaters . " As they topped a rise , Morgan gasped . There were tipis dotting the plain , rows and rows of them like strange conical houses . Horse herds grazed in bunches and dogs roamed everywhere . It was a chilling and a thrilling sight . Even Patch was impressed . " Heap of ' em , " he said . " Wo n't stay long . Big pow-wow . Lot of smoke and talk . Been goin ' on better'n a week . " " War talk ? " asked Patch . " Some , I reckon . We had a good winter , lots of prime furs . But , there 's talk of whiskey tradin ' , cheatin ' white eyes and booshway promises broke . Somethin 's goin ' on . " " I reckon , " said Patch laconically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the p 203 wonder of it , the maze of tipis , their poles scratching the cloudy sky , their lodge flaps open , buffalo skulls and totems painted on tipi hides . Women and children followed along , all talking and screeching , pointing and laughing . Morgan felt like he was in a parade . Boys tugged at Whistling Elk 's legs , asking him all kinds of questions , but he shooed them away like gnats and never told them what they wanted to know . " Looks like a one big mess , do n't it , Lem ? " asked Silas . " But all them tipis is in particular order . I spread my blankets with the Little Robe tribe over yonder . " He pointed to a cluster of tipis . Morgan noticed that each camp was a separate circle . " Me and Lame Bull will talk to Whistling Elk , see can we get your rifles and possibles back . Just keep ridin ' on toward that far circle of lodges . I reckon those are your mules and pack horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trouble , will it ? " Hawke asked . " I do n't reckon , " said Silas , but he did n't smile . " See you boys directly . " Silas rode off toward Lame Bull . Lem headed for the Little Robe lodges , followed by Morgan , Patch and Looking Loon . They were not followed , which seemed odd to Morgan . But as he looked again at the huge camp , he knew there would be little chance of escaping . Even if he had his rifle , he would be swarmed over by Crows the minute he tried to ride away . " Pa , are we prisoners ? " he asked abruptly . " Why , no , I do n't reckon . Are we , Patch ? " " I would n't make a run for it . Like Silas said , these niggers are mighty skittery . I do n't blame ' em none . " " Huh ? " asked Morgan . " We did n't do nothin ' to ' em . " Patch halted several yards from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan stopped their horses , knowing the trapper had something to say . Looking Loon reined up , too . p 204 Sisco moved his eyepatch to one side , rubbed his dead eye . Morgan thought it was a hideous sight . " I been expectin ' this , or somethin ' like this , " said Patch , speaking softly . " I been watchin ' the doin 's in St. Louis , listenin ' to all the talk . They 's big money in furs and there are them as do n't care how they get the beaver . Ever since Manuel Lisa come here to trade , way back before Lewis and Clark come up the Missouri , they 's been politics ahind ever ' move , ever ' brigade . " " Politics ? " Lem asked . Patch nodded , waggled a bony finger in the air . " Rich folks back East been puttin ' money into brigades , expeditions and such . Some say the government is behind some of it , or all of it . Not many white trappers out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Clark come home and started braggin ' on the country , how rich it was . " " Well , that 's why we 're here , " said Lem . " That 's why you come out here . And Silas . " " True enough , true enough , " assented Patch . " I hired on with some of those brigades and I seen cutthroats hire on and seen men kilt for furs and coin . Lisa and his bunch fought with the Rees and beat back the Mandans and bluffed their way through the Assinboines . I seen him back down chief after chief with his talk and showing them his firepower . He traded with the Crow down on the Yellowstone and they was glad to get his goods . But things have been changin ' the past few years . " " The Crows still want to trade , do n't they ? " asked Lem . " Silas has been livin ' and tradin ' with ' em . " " Silas come out here afore I did , " said Patch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A long time ago , he saw all the fur companies formin ' up and he did n't want no part of it . So , he become a red nigger and he 's probably saltin ' it away . I never p 205 could cotton to these red coons , and so I stayed with the companies until I seen what the Major was a-doin ' and how greed had got into Jocko 's blood . Ai n't but a question of time afore this is all ruint and the redskins come after usthe Crow , the Blackfoot , the Sioux , ever ' damn one of ' em . " " You think that 's what 's happening here ? " Lem asked , trying to swallow a knot in his throat . " You think the Crow are fixin ' to fight all the white men coming out here ? " Patch looked around him as if checking to make sure no Indian could hear him . His eye narrowed and the patch seemed to bulge with that dead eye trying to see right through it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years now . But , I never seed so many Crow in one place before . They 's somethin ' stirrin ' out here , somethin ' mighty peculiar and mighty dangerous . It 's like you get a feelin ' real deep down and you ca n't shake it nohow . These Crow are itchin ' for a fight , some of ' em , and maybe they 'll smoke the pipe and cool down , but I ai n't about to bet hard coin on it . " " You mean we might not get to trap and make our fortune ? " Morgan asked . " Well , I ai n't perdictin ' nothin ' , son . It 's just feels like somethin 's tightenin ' down and I do n't hardly know what it is . " " Be a damned shame , " said Lem . " Just gettin ' close and havin ' everythin ' blow up in our faces . " " Now , do n't get to jumpin ' the gun on what I say , " said Patch . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing . " " I 'm glad we did n't go with the Major , " said Morgan . Lem looked at his son in astonishment . Patch cracked a dry smile and winked with his one good eye . " Son , you 're beginnin ' to learn politics , " said Sisco . " And Jocko , " said Morgan , " he ai n't no better . " Patch nodded sagely . " Jocko DeSam learnt all he knows p 206 from Angus MacDougal , " he said . " Do n't you forget that none . Morgan sobered , looked back toward the main camp , trying to pick out Silas . Patch had made him very nervous and apprehensive . He expected to see every Crow in camp come riding down on them with knives and hatchets , screaming for their blood . He shook off the thought as he saw the children playing the hoop and stick game , chasing after each other in what looked like tag . Older boys tended the horses . It seemed very peaceful there . Maybe Patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all right . When he looked back toward the Little Robe circle , he saw two women walking toward them . They were followed , from a distance , by several older men , women and children . But the two women drew Morgan 's interest . They moved slowly and seemed shy . One was older than the other . They were whispering to each other and the younger one was giggling . " Looky yonder , " Morgan said , without pointing . " Two squaws are comin ' out here . " Lem , Patch and Loon followed Morgan 's gaze . They all stared , fascinated , at the two women . They had obviously spent a lot of time preening themselves . They wore elkskin dresses , tanned to a golden yellow , bright bead necklaces and painted shell earrings . Each woman had very long black hair ; small eagle feathers dangled gracefully from beaded thongs woven through their tresses . The older woman raised a hand in greeting . She was looking straight at Patch . The younger one hid her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I knowed that one . That 's Blue Shell , old Silas ' woman . " " Well , who 's the other one ? " blurted Morgan . " Never seed her before , " said Patch .  | " Morg , " warned Lem . " You ai n't int'rested in no Injun squaw . " The young woman looked up as she and Blue Shell Woman drew closer . She seemed to be looking straight at Morgan , who was staring owl-eyed at the most beautiful girl he had ever seen . She was so small and graceful , and her face was radiant with light . He failed to see the dark scowl on his father 's face .  | Jose Montez looked at the three men he had hired away from Jocko DeSam . One was a Mexican who spoke little English . His name was Felix Santiago and he had trapped with Manuel Lisa , was a veteran of many Indian battles . One was named Harold Bickham , thirty-five years old , who knew the mountains as well as any . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of the Cree tribe , but he had lived with the Cheyenne , deadly enemies of the Crow . They had four pack mules with them . Montez had bought one from a man who had two , paying too much , but knowing that he was the richer for it . He knew they might have to trade with savages or bribe them for information . Perhaps , as Jocko had told him , having trade goods , whiskey , beads , weapons , would come to mean the difference between life and death in this wild , untamed land . He had paid the men in gold coin and promised more if they p 209 led him to Lemuel Hawke . The three hirelings had one thing in common : all were greedy and all had blood on their hands . In that , they were not much different than himself . Indeed , over the weeks past , he had come to hold many of the men on the river in high regardnot for their qualities of character , but for their bravery and determination . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some foolish , some stupid , but willing to undergo extreme hardship in order to attain riches . He and his brother had been like that , willing to take risks , great risks , in order to live like men and not like the sewer rats , the dogs and stray cats of Spain . Montez also realized that he had gradually become more and more like the men he formerly scorned . He had regarded them as drifters enslaved to the booshway , men without backbones or men without cojones . Aimless men , without purpose . Yet , he realized now that while these companions had picked a hard journey , they remained fiercely independent while loyal to the booshway , DeSam . And so , he had become like them , at least for this journey , this quest for revenge . He had seen his reflection in the river that morning and it was like seeing the face of a stranger . He had grown a full beard , and now he felt as if he was wearing a disguise . The man he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , although he had no desire to wade in cold water and set traps for beaver and marten . It seemed curious , that was all , that he had unconsciously taken on the trappings of a mountain man even though he had never been to the Rockies before . Perhaps that was as it should be , Montez thought . He would descend to the level of his quarry , if that was necessary , and when it was over , he would shave off his beard and become himself again . Still , the shock of seeing that bearded stranger peering back at him made him wonder if he had not lost his  | mind . He vowed not to forget the reason he had come this far , that his brother was still dead and Lemuel Hawke must pay in kind , with his own life . Montez smiled in satisfaction as his hired trackers looked over another of the Hawkes and their companions ' camps , reading the sign left behind by four men . " They keep the watches , " said Doucette . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest and one ear that had been chewed into a shapeless mass of flesh . He wore greasy buckskins , thick-soled Cree moccasins and carried a large knife he had made from a wagon spring . Its handle was made of tough antelope antler , wound tight with glued buffalo hide thongs that gave his hand a solid grip . " The Delaware , he always sleeps by himself , away from the others . " " How close are we ? " asked Montez . Hal Bickham , stooped over the bent grasses , looked up at Montez . " Two days . " Bickham was lean , slat-chested , stood five foot nine inches in his boot moccasins . His buckskins had been patched until his shirt looked like a leather quilt . He had pale , vacuous blue eyes , deep-sunk in a cadaverous face . His nose had been broken more than once , and there was a thin scar on his forehead that indicated he had once come close to being scalped . His forelock was bone white , in sharp contrast to his rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tres dias , " he said in Spanish . Bickham scowled at the Mexican . Santiago was from Santa Fe , an outcast , a wanderer . He had the high cheekbones of the Yaqui , the vermillion smear of Indian blood reddening his dark skin . " Three , maybe , " said Bickham . He looked again at the crushed grasses . " They been movin ' fast , but I look for them to slow down some . They ai n't kilt no fresh meat in two days . "  | " That is right , " said Santiago , looking at the bones and gristle around a shallow hole that showed signs of fireblackening . " They did not make meat for two days . " Montez knew that he had to rely on these men . He could not read sign , could not track a man in such a wild place . He was more at home in the squalid back alleys of Barcelona where he and his brother grew up , or on the docks of New Orleans , the dark , bayou-scented streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slick and wet by the swampy nightsweat and his breath was only a part of the gulf fog . But he knew he had picked the right menhe had watched them for days , and had seen that they trusted each other . And , now , he would have to trust them for as long as he needed them . " There is little game , " said Pierre . " The Indiens , eh ? They have hunted much along this river . They drive the sumbitch game away . " Montez knew that to be true . They had seen only small animals all morning , antelope in the distance . There had been no deer or elk tracks , none fresh and no sign of buffalo . The sky was clouded up and he was afraid it would rain before nightfall . That would make the tracking harder , he knew . " I want to cut those three days by one or two , " said the Spaniard . " You do not know this sumbitch country , " said Doucette . " She makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind and tricks him , eh  --  ever ' damn way she can . Is it not so , mes amis ? " " You got that plumb center , " said Bickham . " ' Bout all you got out here is time , Josie . Days do n't make no difference . Ai n't nobody waitin ' for you to get anyplace . Ai n't nobody goin ' to get away , you stay on their track . If you ai n't expected , it do n't make no difference when you get there . " p 212 " What if it rains ? " asked Montez . " There would be no tracks . " They had encountered so many sudden rains on their journey , Montez almost expected it as a daily occurrence . " Then , " said Doucette , with a sly grin , " you have to track them in here . " He tapped his index finger against his forehead . The men chuckled at that , even Josie Montez . He knew what Pierre meant . The good hunter always had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hunted . He had already learned , from traveling with Jocko DeSam , that progress was made at the whim of the weather , the river , of nature itself . Impatience was a killer in such country . It was not a trait he nurtured , but he knew that he had better start practicing patience if he wanted to find Lemuel Hawke and cut his throat . Montez looked at the sky again , wondering if it would rain and delay the tracking . Finally , he resolved the questions in his mind . " We will go on , then , " he said . " Do you have any idea where those men are headed ? " Santiago shrugged , looked into the distance . Trees lined the Musselshell as it wound like a serpent through hilly , broken country . In the distance , behind clouds , the mountain ranges began . There were no boundaries , only those claimed by various tribes , and they moved around like the beasts in Eden , going where the game was , fighting with other tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a loss for anything to say . " They are headed where the river takes them , " said Doucette , and that was sufficient answer for Montez . For all of his life , he had done virtually the same thing . He and his brother , the one they called Spanish Jack in St. Louis , had grown up in the slums of Barcelona . Their father , Ernesto Montez , had been a petty thief , their mother a washerwoman . p 213 The family lived in poverty , but Ernesto always seemed to have pesetas enough to buy the wine . After he got drunk , he would beat his wife , Maria , until her screams went silent and she was senseless . When the boys grew old enough to protest , Ernesto beat them , too , not just with his fists , but with broom handles , wash paddles and iron burglar tools . Josie and Jack , known then as Pepe and Juan , learned their father 's trade by the time Jack was seven , Josie was eight . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal chicken and bread from merchants , how to steal purses in rich Roman Catholic churches . When Josie was fifteen , he ran away from home . One day he found Jack sleeping under a bridge and learned that he had run away from home , too . He also learned that Ernesto had killed their mother , bludgeoned her to death with a bar he used to pry open windows in wealthy homes when the owners were absent . Both boys lived on the streets , sleeping in country woods , stealing food and money , more than enough to fill their bellies and put fat on their ribs . They were husky and mean young men , wise in the ways of the streets and the back alleys , when they were shanghaied on a ship going to New Orleans . They jumped ship in New Orleans and found that thievery was just as profitable there as it had been in Barcelona . They saved their money , learned to steal not just enough for subsistence but enough to make a profit . They learned the ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had retired from the high seas and banded together a group of urchins whom he taught the finer points of larceny . " Do n't steal food from an untended wagon , " Blinky told them . " Steal the wagon , the horse , and all the goods . Then you are in business . You can steal from a wharf and load the goods p 214 in your wagon . You can sell these goods at market just like any other enterprising merchant . " Blinky was murdered one night as he slept . Jack learned that two of the ex-mariner 's men had done it , believing the old pirate had a sack of gold in his diggings . Jack killed them both , stabbing one in a fair fight , strangling the other with his bare hands in a blind rage . Those first kil ings had opened up other paths to him . He became well known as a man who would do anything for money and none of it had to be legal . Some of his clients were wealthy men , others were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed many a river in their lives . Jack was gone , now , but Josie would avenge his death as Jack had avenged Blinky 's . He had other rivers to follow before he gave up his ghost . But he wondered where the river would lead them . His scalp prickled as he thought of the stories he 'd listened to around the brigade campfirestales of savage Indian attacks , scalping , torture . He wanted to kill Lemuel Hawke , his kid Morgan , if necessary , and be done with it . The men he had hired were free to go their own way after they found the Hawkes for him . Beyond that , he could n't reason . All he knew was that he could get back to St. Louis on his own . He could follow the sun and the rivers back to civilization . Let these cursed half-wild trappers have this worthless , godforsaken land . Morgan 's eyes widened , his mouth opened , went slack . He felt a jellied quivering in his knees . The girl hung back behind Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . " Patch , " said Blue Shell . " You come back . " " Yes , Blue Shell . I come to trap the beaver . " Lem looked at p 215 the trapper , scratched the back of his head . He had never seen Patch act so polite . " Gray Hawk say you bring white friend . " " This be Lemuel and his son , Morgan . They are friends of Gray Hawk . " " Morgan ? Gray Hawk name Morgan . " Patch nodded . " This could be complicated , " he said to Lem . " Any suggestions ? " " I named Morgan after Silas . " " And now the Crow call him Gray Hawk . So , you got Morgan Hawke and Silas Morgan Gray Hawk . " " Let Silas explain it , " said Lem . Blue Shell wore a puzzled expression on her face . " Gray Hawk will tell Blue Shell about the white man 's name , " said Patch . " Ask her who her little friend is , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Patch . " Morgan , " said Lem , " you just remember that 's a Injun gal . You keep your pecker in your pants . " " Oh , Pa , that ai n't what I was a-thinkin ' . " " I know damned well what you was a-thinkin ' . " Morgan did n't want an argument with his father now , not in front of the Indian girl . She was still peering at him from over Blue Shell 's shoulder , shy as a mouse . The two women were joined by others , children , old men and women , all silently staring at the three white men and the Indian from an unknown tribe . Gradually , they began to speak among themselves and Morgan wondered what they were saying . He continued to look at the young girl with Blue Shell , taken by her beauty , fascinated by her long , raven-black tresses that reached well beyond her knees . She had glistening fawn eyes and smooth dark skin . She seemed , to Morgan , like something forbidden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p 216 A few moments later , Silas and Lame Bull , along with two other braves , walked up , leading their pack mules and carrying their rifles and possibles pouches . " Any trouble ? " asked Patch . " Some . You did the right thing , giving Lame Bull , and the others , those gifts . Them coons what tied you up wanted it all , ' pears like , but old Whistling Elk wanted to talk it over with his chief first . Otherwise you might not have no hair and be wolf meat . " Lem paled . Morgan shifted his attention from the girl to Silas as the mountain man handed him his rifle , pouch , the medicine horn and his priming horn . " See you still got it , " said Silas . " I wo n't never part with it , Silas . " " That 's another reason you still got your hair . That horn is powerful medicine , like I tolt you when I give it to you . " " I know , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Patch . Silas spoke to Lame Bull and the other two braves , Little Fox and Crooked Face . Lame Bull spoke briefly to Silas . " He is going to tell his family to put up a lodge for you . He wants to be your friend . He has told us about Morgan shooting a charging buffler with one shot . The bull gets bigger ever ' time he tells the story . He told Hunts the Sky , chief of the Little Robes , that the bull was as big as the medicine lodge and was breathin ' on your face when you dropped it . " Morgan laughed . " It was damned nigh that big , " said Patch . " And , it was a-blowin ' steam on his face , " said Lem , proudly . " Come on to my digs whilst the Crow make ready to feast you , " said Silas , suddenly serious . He looked over his shoulder p 217 toward the main camp . " There still may be some bad blood with Whistling Elk 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them whilst we chew the fat , catch up on past times . " Silas slapped Morgan and Lem on their backs . The crowd turned as if on a signal and streamed back to their lodges . The sky seemed to lighten and soon there was a break in the clouds . Shafts of light struck the tipis , made them shine like giant white beacons . Morgan could tell that the Crow had been hunting buffalo . Everywhere he looked , he saw big chunks of meat drying on willow racks , the tongues black and fat , the big black pots steaming , smelling of cooked meat . There were deer and elk , fresh-killed , hanging from pole tripods , gutted out , their heads lolling . Women were skinning some of the deer , others were tanning hides . There seemed to be plenty of food in camp , and the people seemed happy . All of it was a wonder to Morgan , seeing so many Indians all at once , seeing how they lived . They seemed , oddly enough , like ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lodges . The encampment was the strangest city he had ever seen , yet it felt just like a white man 's city , except there were no stores , no taverns , no permanent dwellings . " I see you met Blue Shell , " said Silas as they followed the others back to the Little Robe lodge circle . " Fine woman , fine woman . " " Who 's that girl with her ? " asked Morgan . " What gal is that ? " asked Silas , winking . " Aw , you know , Silas . " " I told him not to pay her no mind , " said Lem . " We do n't want no trouble like we had in St. Louis . " " Her name is Yellow Bead , " said Silas . " She ai n't never took up with a buck . Her pa was kilt by Blackfoot . She lives with her  | mother , Basket Woman . We all kind of help out with food and such . " " How old is she ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " said Silas . " Thirteen , fourteen summers , the way Injuns count , I reckon . " There was a buffalo skull , blanched white by the sun , the hide eaten away by worms , sitting on a large rock outside Silas ' lodge . The skull was painted with red , yellow and black lines , and decorated with mysterious symbols . Silas went past it , stood by the flap . " Go on in and set , " he said . " Walk to the left and around the fire . The Crow are mighty keen on ceremony . You got to do everythin ' right or they think you got a bad heart . " Morgan went in first . He was anxious to see Yellow Bead again . His heart was pounding as he ducked down and entered the tipi . He blinked his eyes , trying to adjust to the dim light . He waddled to the left , following the circular perimeter of the lodge . Blue Shell and Yellow Bead were stirring something in two pots hanging on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiling meat and herbs made Morgan 's stomach churn with hunger . The smoke from the fire went straight up through the smoke hole . The women seemed not to notice him . He waddled all the way around and sat down . His pa followed close behind him , then came Patch , Looking Loon and , finally , Silas himself . The tipi seemed spacious to Morgan . There were buffalo robes for beds , lots of deer and elk hides and bales of beaver , marten and lynx furs stacked up along one side . Silas ' flintlock rifle , his possibles bag , powder horns , tomahawks and extra knives in beautiful quilled scabbards lay on a platform of buffalo hides . There were cooking utensils , bowls , spoons and ladles all neatly arranged close to the fire . p 219 Lem looked around , too , then sat crosslegged like the others . " We got no chairs as such , " said Silas . " Just lay your rifles and pouches back along the wall and make yourselves comfortable . The women 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue Shell say something to Yellow Bead . Yellow Bead had her head bent so that he could not see her face . She picked up some bowls and horn spoons , handed them to Silas , first , then to Looking Loon , Patch , Lem , and finally , to Morgan . She put another bowl in the empty space next to Morgan . " Oho , " said Silas , " looky there . " " What ? " asked Morgan . " Looks like Yellow Bead 's taken a liking to you , Morgan . That 's her bowl she set there by your side . " Lem tried to conceal his sudden frown , but Morgan caught it . " Well , it do n't make no nevermind to me , " said Morgan quickly . He wanted no outburst from his pa . Inside , his nerves were jangling , his stomach quivering , and it was n't from a hungering for food . Blue Shell said something in Crow to Silas . Then , she looked at Morgan and smiled . " Yep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you done made a friend . Blue Shell says that Yellow Bead is plumb stuck on you . " " Well , Morgan ai n't takin ' up with no Injun gal , " said Lem . " Lem , " Silas said softly , " you ca n't keep on lumpin ' all womens in the same pile as Roberta . One bad woman do n't make ' em all bad . " " I ai n't never met a good ' un yet , " said Lem stubbornly . " Pa , do n't , " said Morgan . " I ai n't takin ' up with Yellow Bead . I just think she 's mighty purty , that 's all . " Lem said nothing , but he fed on bitter memories of his wife , Roberta , Morgan 's mother , who abandoned them and took up p 220 with another man . He still hated her . He hated all women , in fact , and he meant to see that Morgan learned how bad they were so 's he would n't get hurt by ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooking irons and carried it to a flat stone wrapped in deerhide , a kind of small table in front of Silas . She set the pot down and handed her husband the ladle , one that Silas had bought in St. Louis . " Let 's eat , " said Silas , dipping the ladle into the pot . Yellow Bead and Blue Shell waited until all the men had taken food , then served themselves . Blue Shell sat by herself , but Yellow Bead sat next to Morgan . " Buffler meat , " said Silas as they all began eating . " Best vittles a man ever tasted . " Morgan barely heard him above the beating of his heart . Yellow Bead sat so close to him , he could smell the fragrance of flowers in her hair , the earthy smell of her body under the white dress she wore . When he shifted position , he put his hand down and touched a pile of her hair puddled on the packed earth next to him . It was soft to his touch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ froze in his chest . He caught Looking Loon staring at him . There was a twinkle in the Delaware 's eye .  | Lem did n't believe Morgan 's excuse that he wanted to look after the horses . He suspected that his son wanted to do some sparking with Yellow Bead , who with Blue Shell had gone down to the river to do the washing . " Silas , " he said , after Morgan had gone away , " let 's go somewheres by ourselfs and have a smoke and a talk . " " Fetch your pipe . " Patch said he was going to see Hunts the Sky , chief of the Little Robes . He said he wanted to give him some tobacco and gifts , renew their friendship . Looking Loon stayed in the tipi to sleep . The two walked to a patch of timber , found a place where they could rest in the shade . The sun had burned through the clouds . There would be no rain that day . Lem gave Silas some tobacco for his pipe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Silas . " Tobaccer 's been scarce this summer . " " I 'll leave you ten pounds when we set out , " said Lem . Lem used his magnifying glass to light his pipe . Silas struck fire from flint and steel into his bowl , blew on the sparks until they caught . The tobacco was good and dry , gave off a strong aroma . " What 's on your mind , Lemuel ? " Silas blew a spume of smoke into the air . " I want you to show me the way to the mountains . Me and Morg want to pull out in the morning . We aim to trap beaver hard as we can . " " What 's your hurry , Lem ? You just got here . They 'll be feastin ' tonight , and likely all the clans will want you to visit ' em . Ai n't time to trap yet . " " We want to get settled , " Hawke said lamely . " Haw . Well , this old coon 's goin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be here in a week . The Crow got their buffler and will spend the rest of the summer in the cool high country . Some of the bucks will trap so they can do some tradin ' in the spring . Just hold your horses , Lem . " " We really want to get movin ' , me and Morg . " Silas sucked deeply on his pipe , rolled the smoke around in his mouth . He let it out slowly , then looked off through the trees . Snatches of laughter and ribbons of Crow voices floated on the afternoon air . The sun made dappled shadows in the copse of trees . Water splashed down at the river from swimmers playing along the shore . There was a peace in the air that belied the turmoil inside the man who sat across from him leaning against a birch tree . " Lem , you and Morgan do n't want to be goin ' off by yourselfs . I did it once't and paid dearly for it . Them mountains ai n't no place for greenhorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty partic'lar as to who comes into ' em and who comes out alive . " " You did it . " " Nope . I went with a brigade the first time . I went into the mountains on my own the next year and damned near died . These Crow saved my life , brought me out . " " What happened ? " " I shot me a elk with a rack big enough to hold a dozen coats and hats . Thought he was dead . They was snowdrifts higher'n a man 's head and it were wet snow , stuck to you like feathers to tar . Welp , that elk upped and ran one of them long tines through my gut . Burnt like fire and I had to stuff my innards back in my belly . It were the snow what kept me from dyin ' right off . I got back to my camp , no more'n a deadfall pine I rigged up for a shelter . I sewed my belly back up , but I was a-bleedin ' inside . I packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burnin ' no more . But I got the deleriums and the fever and some passin ' Crow heard me , thought I was makin ' big medicine . " Silas paused and Lem leaned forward to hear the rest of the story . " What did they do ? " asked Hawke . " They rigged a travvy and carried me down the mountains . It were the Little Robes and Yellow Bead 's pa made medicine over me . Her ma tended me with herbs and river clay until I no longer got the twitches ever ' time I took breath . " " That was a accident , " said Lem . " You ought to have known better . " " I was plumb hungry and crazy and cold . My old bean was n't workin ' right that day . I should have come up on the bull another way and had my fusil cocked . Point is , the mountains do n't ' llow many mistakes . I was lucky . If them Crow had n't come along , this old coon would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and Morg are goin ' . In the mornin ' , for certain sure . We 'll get to the mountains on our own . " " You talked this over with Morgan ? You might want to stick with Sisco . Him and that Delaware knows the country mighty well . " " Morg wants to get to trappin ' pretty bad . " " You ever trapped beaver ? " Silas asked , his voice lowpitched , deceptively smooth . " Now , you know we ai n't , Silas . But I been thinkin ' on it , studyin ' in my head what you tolt me about catching beaver and such . I reckon we 'll do just fine . " " Well , you could trade for your furs and take ' em back to St. Louis and get a fair price . Save you a heap of worrisomes . " " We aim to trade and trap , too . Ai n't that the way it 's done ? " " That 's so , " said Silas . " If you go off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's already been staked out . You might have to fight for the skins you take . " " Other trappers ? " " And Injuns . They 'll be a bunch a-trappin ' them streams . ' Less'n you got a map , know which is which , you could get lost or worse , get kilt . " " I thought there was plenty of room up in the mountains . " " They is , but it gets more crowded ever ' season . The Crow say they 's a big brigade a-comin ' up the Platte , Angus MacDougal 's bunch , and more on the Big Horn and up on the Milk and the Judith . Crow do n't like it none . I heard tell Jocko DeSam 's goin ' to trade with the Blackfeet up north . Runners come in the other day , sayin ' four men from his bunch are comin ' up the Musselshell , headed our way . " Silas looked at Lem closely . " Four men ? " " Mighty peculiar , ai n't it ? You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silas ' eyes narrowed and his teeth clamped his pipe tightly . He did not draw on it , but waited for an answer . " Didwas one of ' em a Spaniard ? " Silas took his pipe from his mouth . It was made of pink pipestone , a gift from Blue Shell 's father , Turns Back the Enemy . " The Crows what seen ' em knew three of the men . They been here before . They did n't know the other man , just that he was dark-skinned and had hair on his face . " Lem let out a shallow sigh . " Maybe it ai n't him , then , " he said . " Who ? " asked Silas . " Spanish Jack 's brother . Josie Montez . " " He 's a bad one . What makes you think it ai n't him ? " " I seen Josie once't . He was with MacDougal and Jocko . He di n't have no beard . " " Man can grow a beard in a week , " said Silas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Morgan better wait and see if he 's one of them four men . Be a heap safer here where you got friends . Runners said they was about three days ride from camp . " " I ai n't afraid of him , " said Lem . Silas knocked the dottle out of his pipe , banging the bowl gently against an ash tree . " You want to leave tomorry , I 'll point you toward the mountains . You 'll have no river to guide you once you leave the Musselshell , but you ai n't got far to go . " " We 'll be a-leavin ' , " said Lem . " Sorry to see you go , " said Silas . " Might not see you again . " " You 're just tryin ' to scare me , Silas . " " Hell , I hope I do . " He got up and Lem knew the conversation was over . He
