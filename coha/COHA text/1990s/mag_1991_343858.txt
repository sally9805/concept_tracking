With flying fingers , fine sutures and a potent arsenal of drugs , surgical teams have become so successful at transplanting organs that the demand for viable tissue has far outstripped supply . In 1967 , the first person ever to feel the beat of another man 's heart in his own chest survived for just 18 days after the operation . Today , more than eight out of 10 heart recipients live at least a year with their borrowed organs . For kidney transplants , first-year survival tops 90% . As success rates soar , doctors attempt ever more variations on the transplant theme : installing a new pancreas , lobes of a live donor 's lungs , even several organs at once . But rising hopes mean more people will be disappointed . Some 23,000 Americans desperately await replacement organs this year ; if current shortages continue , more than 2,000 of them will die before a donor is found . <P> The present golden age of transplants occurred only after researchers began tackling one of medicine 's greatest puzzles : How do you sneak a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dedicated to the proposition that all alien tissue is dangerous and should be destroyed ? On the one hand , doctors try to disable the body 's defenses just enough so that they will not reject the transplant . Here the trick is not to go overboard and completely cripple the immune system , leaving the body open to attack by deadly viruses and bacteria . On the other hand , they try to cajole the body 's defenders into accepting the graft as one of its own . <P> In 1980 , a single drug , derived from a Scandinavian soil sample , provided a stunning breakthrough in the effort to tame the immune system . Cyclosporine targets the killer T cells  --  the cellular commandos that seek out alien tissues after other defenders have marked them for elimination . Within a few years of the drug 's introduction , first-year survival rates for kidney recipients jumped from 50% to over 80% . Only a handful of drugs have had such an impact on the history of medicine . <P> But cyclosporine is not perfect . It damages the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctors try to minimize these problems by using the lowest possible dose of the medication and supplementing it with other drugs that suppress the immune system , including steroids . Two experimental drugs , FK-506 and rapamycin , may be many times more powerful than cyclosporine but have yet to prove more effective in clinical trials . <P> If everybody had an identical twin from which to harvest organs , such drugs would be unnecessary . Failing that , doctors try , where possible , to find the closest approximation of a twin : a good genetic match . In a feat every bit as heroic as cracking the Enigma code during World War II , immunologists have determined just what makes for a good tissue match . Research dating from the 1960s shows that the immune system has developed its own set of molecular passwords , called human leukocyte antigens , that identify every nerve , every capillary , every organ as either friend or foe . If a cell displays the right HLA molecules on its surface , the T cells will leave it alone . If not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
