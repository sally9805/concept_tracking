Can one , at this point , disentangle Dan Quayle from Dan Quayle jokes ? He seems to induce a short attention span in others , leaving them stunned with a serene vacancy . The New Republic has penalized with mock awards people who are foolhardy enough to speak well of him . Can anyone be taken seriously who takes Quayle seriously ? <P> As the polls show , Quayle has not recovered from the way he was shoved into the public arena under a rain of blows . Gallup reported last month that 54% of the public  --  including 43% of Republicans  --  said he is not qualified to be President ; 49% thought Bush should pick a new running mate for ' 92 . " My skills , " Quayle said recently , " have always been in negotiating and conciliating . " That sounds like wishful thinking from a man so long under assault , including the deadly assault of laughter . Like Charlie Chaplin in the ring , what can he do but crouch behind the referee and wave his gloves in vague call-it-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so badly in need of it . <P> When he was elected to the Senate in 1980 , Quayle told political scientist Richard Fenno , " I know one committee I do n't want  --  Judiciary . They are going to be dealing with all those issues like abortion , busing , voting rights , prayer . I 'm not interested in those issues , and I want to stay as far away from them as I can . " Yet Quayle was not raised among people who shied from extremes . He is the coeval of the cold war : the year of his birth , 1947 , also gave us the CIA , the Attorney General 's list of subversives and the internal-security program . When Quayle was five years old , Dwight Eisenhower carried Indiana with the help of Quayle 's grandfather , publisher Eugene Pulliam , and William Jenner , who were , respectively , the right and the far right of the state Republican Party . When the John Birch Society was set up in 1958 with the thesis that Eisenhower had collaborated with communism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quayle compared Birch Society founder Robert Welch to the legendary prophet Nostradamus . <P> When Dan Quayle was starting high school in Arizona , his neighbor Barry Goldwater was beginning his race for the presidency . When Richard Nixon ran for re-election in 1972 , Quayle 's father decided that Nixon , like Eisenhower , had betrayed the conservative movement  --  so Quayle pere supported the insurgent Republican right-wing candidate John Ashbrook . When Quayle entered the Senate , it was as the beneficiary of a conservative political-action- committee blitz that knocked off five liberal Senators that year ( including his opponent , Birch Bayh of Indiana ) . Quayle 's whole ( short ) adult life was spent cocooned in the modern conservative movement . He should have spread his butterfly wings as an ideologue , yet he came out talking compromise . That is the most striking thing about his intellectual formation .
