<p> An alliance of environmentalists works to create an international park in the Cascades of Washington and British Columbia . <p> The North Cascades straddle 70 miles of the Washington-British Columbia border , encompassing some of the wildest places left in North America . Jagged peaks crowned with spires rise out of the valleys to guard lush meadows and forests of giant trees . Hundreds of massive glaciers hang over rock faces and sprawl across steep slopes , feeding icy streams and lakes cascading into waterfalls . In the winter , fierce storms moving inland off the Pacific Ocean bury this lovely craggy habitat in snow and render it inaccessible to all but the heartiest travelers . <p> Although natives of the Upper Skagit and Chelan valleys had hunted and fished in these mountains for centuries , it took a long time for white settlers to penetrate the rugged terrain . You need only look at a map to imagine the experiences of the early explorers who named Terror Creek , Mount Fury , Mount Despair , and Damnation Peak . <p> Even as settlements rose in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided the range between Washington and British Columbia remained invisible  --  a mere line on a map . It climbed up and over ridges , bisected rivers , and split valleys . But as the settlements grew , each nation managed its side of the mountains differently , until the border became painfully obvious . <p> Activism and legislation protected the forests on one side better than on the other . The North Cascades National Park Complex , designated in 1968 in the United States , affords some protection for the range . As logging threatened forests near the park , additional lands were designated as wilderness areas in 1988 . But protection has not been adequate on the Canadian side . Outside of a few small parks , the land has been intensively logged to nearly 4,500 feet in elevation just north of the U.S. border . <p> Although the 49th parallel now separates a thick forest from a bare one , the scar unifies rather than divides Americans and Canadians . By spoiling the previously undisturbed face of the North Cascades and altering the region 's ecosystem , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to attain greater protection for the region . <p> Although the 1988 management plan for North Cascades National Park recommended that the park become the core of a protected regional ecosystem , and that discussions about an international park be initiated with British Columbia , nothing tangible materialized . But in 1992 , at the urging of the National Parks and Conservation Association , environmentalists from Canada and the United States joined forces to form the Cascades International Alliance . The goal , the alliance announced , was to establish an international park to protect the North Cascades . <p> The alliance consists of 11 conservation groups from the United States and Canada , renewing an association that began in the early 1970s . At that time , Seattle City Light  --  the public authority that supplies power to Seattle  --  in-tended to increase the height of Ross Dam , though it would have flooded thousands of acres of pristine wilderness in the Skagit River Valley on both sides of the border . Cooperative activism blocked High Ross Dam , and led to an agreement stipulating that the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle City Light . The agreement not only prevented the destruction of key recreational areas but fostered the Skagit Environmental Endowment Commission , which has maintained a limited forum on resource management among American and Canadian agencies since 1983 . <p> " What needs to be protected and how that 's accomplished is different now than it was then , " says Dave Fluharty , president of the North Cascades Conservation Council , one of the U.S. organizations in the alliance and a key player in the High Ross Dam controversy . " We had an international vision in the early 1960s when we pushed to establish North Cascades National Park , but we lacked the scientific arguments to do then what we can do now . " <p> With environmentally sensitive administrations on both sides of the border , this may be an optimal time to put forth a proposal for an international park in the North Cascades . " We 're very interested in participating in the pro-cess involving an international park and working closer with British Columbia on joint ecosystem management , " says Bill Paleck , superintendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the former environment minister for British Columbia , had also expressed enthusiasm for the proposal . ( Cashore was removed from office September 15 , but NPCA Northwest Pacific Regional Director Dale Crane is working to secure a commitment from the new environment minister , Moe Sihota . ) Once the official plan is drawn , international park designation will require formal agreement at the highest levels within both nations , involving negotiations between Washington , D.C. , and Ottawa . <p> With initial encouragement from managing agencies in both nations , the alliance is now tackling what is perhaps the most exciting phase of the campaign-the planning and development of an international park . After months of listening to interest groups on both sides of the border , the alliance envisions a preserved park core surrounded by differently managed land zones that work as a unit to protect the ecological integrity of the North Cascades , accommodate recreation , and allow limited use of forest resources . <p> The backbone of the plan is the park core itself  --  an area of maximum protection , comparable to a U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be preserved in their natural state . Hunting and resource extraction would be prohibited . The U.S. Department of the Interior and the B.C. Ministry of Parks would manage the park core in partnership . Once the core was determined , the park plan would incorporate a series of surrounding ecological reserves administered by the U.S. Forest Service and the B.C. Forest Ministry . Roads , recreational development , hunting , and resource extraction would be allowed in the reserves , as long as the ecosystem was not impaired . The final component of the park structure would develop sustainable resources , outside park boundaries , to enhance visitor enjoyment . Services and facilities for park visitors would encourage international attendance and help revive communities once dependent on timbering activities . <p> This innovative plan for an ecological international park does not have a real precedent . " The idea of a park and reserve , managed cooperatively by different agencies to support a common objective , is a new one , " says NPCA 's Dale Crane . " We hope it can be applied to ecosystem protection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace Park may come to mind as a model applicable to the North Cascades , the situations are not exactly parallel . <p> When Waterton and Glacier became an international entity in 1931 , they were already national parks and protected to the highest extent possible . Some of the lands suggested for the proposed Cascades International Park have not been adequately protected and require restoration . Management will rest coop-eratively among multiple agencies within the U.S. and British Columbia  --  some accustomed to managing parks and others to managing forest resources . Herein lies what may be the biggest challenge of this international park . <p> Park and forest management agencies have traditionally been at odds in both nations . In the United States , the Park Service strives to preserve the natural environment while allowing recreational activities , and the Forest Service seeks to balance multiple uses of the land with recreation . In British Columbia , the agencies are more polarized . While the Ministry of Parks functions much like the U.S. Park Service , the Forest Ministry operates solely for the purpose of resource extraction . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way , I believe both agencies can manage in consort , " says Walt Weaver , acting supervisor of the Mt . Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest , which lies to the west and south of the North Cascades Park Complex . " The truth is , as all of our budgets get more constrained , we 're going to have to work together coop-eratively to accomplish our goals . " <p> Two interagency transboundary agreements are already in effect within the North Cascades , linking forest , park , and wildlife agencies in Canada and the United States and laying the groundwork for ecosystem management under an international park plan . The Lower Fraser Basin/North Cascades Fire Management Charter authorizes wild-land fire coordination between both districts and manages the exchange of staff and resources for the entire region . The Interagency Grizzly Bear Recovery Committee is a joint U.S.-British Columbia effort toward recovering the grizzly population throughout the North Cascades ecosystem . While the Canadians are transferring grizzlies into the Canadian North Cascades from other sites in British Columbia , the Americans have decided , for the time being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The North Cascades ecosystem includes about 10 million acres of land that extends from the Columbia River in the east to Puget Sound in the west and from the lower Fraser River basin in the north to the Snoqualmie River in the south . Logging on both sides of the border , along with mining and grazing , dams , agriculture , and development , has degraded this ecosystem . Its health is best gauged by the condition of the wild salmon runs . <p> Wild salmon spawn in forest streams . After the eggs hatch and the fish mature , the salmon leave to feed in the ocean . They eventually return to the forest streams to continue the cycle . After a healthy salmon run , carcasses litter the rivers and gravel bars , providing food for eagles , bears , wolves , and other animals . Since the expansion of settlements in the region , the number of salmon has gradually declined . Salmon stock levels are critically low in some rivers and tributaries that originate in the North Cascades . A decline in salmon numbers means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing some animals to seek food elsewhere . Lack of proper habitat has placed both the grizzly and gray wolf on the endangered species list in the North Cascades . <p> The Endangered Species Act requires all federal agencies in the United States to participate in ecosystem restoration and enhancement . With time , the repair of streams in the North Cascades will increase healthy salmon runs and provide habitats that can sustain populations of grizzly bears and gray wolves . In Canada , however , where environmental legislation is inadequate , the ecosystem is at greater risk . Canada has an endangered species list , but laws do not back it up , making grizzly recovery a moral issue rather than a legal one . Mining and logging have devastated the upper river basins , degrading salmon runs and animal habitats . Unfortunately , Canadians do not have access to the legal processes available to Americans for challenging forest management practices . An international park with specially designated zones for resource extraction , mandated by both nations , is perhaps the best way to maintain the North Cascades as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an end in itself , " says Jake Masselink , assistant deputy minister of British Columbia 's Ministry of Parks . " It 's a means toward beginning cooperative stewardship in the region . " To have a scenic wonder like the North Cascades so close to one of the fastest growing urban regions in the West is a rare gift of nature . As growth continues-and all indications show it will  --  the need for wilderness places will become greater and so will the impact on them . Perhaps one international park , with pooled resources and a plan for regional ecosystem maintenance , can withstand the impact better than individual national parks . <p> But beyond the need for ecosystem protection , another significant reason for an international park in the North Cascades has to do with the place itself . The North Cascades harbors a world of beauty , inspiration , and challenge  --  a place of true wilderness .

Canadians do not have the same legal processes available to Americans for challenging forest management practices .
