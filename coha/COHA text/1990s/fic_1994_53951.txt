ON MOST DAYS WE THOUGHT of him as reliable , if we troubled to think of him at all as we walked the streets of this small coastal town . Our northwest harbor lies mostly wrapped with rain . Wind swirls the hallmark-mist of Pacific beaches lying north of California . The reliable James would appear walking toward you from the mist , like a specter risen from distant waves and on its course toward the haunting of a maritime museum , or a moored ship , or to blow wraith-like above rain-filled and empty streets . There seemed always something moist about him . He gave the impression of being soaked , as though a sheen of water silvered the sidewalks on which he strode . He would only , in fact , be on his way to work at a general store where the main preoccupations dealt with groceries . <p> And groceries being what they are , and James being who he was  --  which is to say , reserved and distant  --  we townspeople could scarcely have realized how that moist man might herald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James for our troubles ; and we will certainly not blame ourselves , but blame looks for somewhere to alight . We can say that trouble centers around the store , and the center of that store expresses the 19th century . The store rises Victorian and fanciful and filled with whispering shadows . <p> Today the place seems only a fey notion from long ago , but in 1870 its customers delighted in cathedral stained-glass windows through which occasional northwest sun painted sacks of feed with roseate glow , or bluely and greenly illuminated racks of corn brooms , new harness , axes , flour barrels ; the hodge-podge of items either useful or ornamental on which Victorian lives depended . <p> And , if there is a curse on this town  --  and if we are doomed in some peculiar way  --  ( because we recognize that to be human is to be doomed , but not necessarily in ways peculiar ) doom began when Able Andrewes came to these parts in the late 1860s . Guns of the Civil War stood stilled . Frontier spread before settlers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of languages : Italian , Chinese , Japanese , English , German , Norwegian , Swedish and French . Andrewes traced his ancestry to English gentry ; thus acted as a very proper type of gentlemanly adventurer  --  a bearer of the white man 's burden  --  and he existed comfortably among Oriental faces , Mediterranean faces , Blacks , Indians , Hawaiians , and Samoans . <p> His Trading Post , as he chose to style it , became the largest building north of San Francisco . It rose four stories , with peaked Victorian roof and fanciful gables . Although structurally a warehouse , ten cathedral windows offered the impression of a church . The trading post stood more certainly , and certainly more handsomely , than any of the town 's several churches . <p> The main floor displayed foodstuffs in kegs , barrels , loaves , bundles , and boxes . Spices and teas perfumed the store , while gas lamps provided light . Stained glass windows portrayed frontier trades : Indians bartering skins of sea otter , Chinese working lime , and , in this town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement rested what was then a modern miracle , a pulley-operated elevator capable of lifting a ton . The elevator carried new wood-burning cookstoves , pumps , bollards , ship fittings , bull tongue plows , wrought iron railings to surround widows ' walks ; heavy merchandise : ships ' anchors to carriage axles . Andrewes made claim that his Trading Post carried at least one of every item manufactured . <p> The second floor displayed hardware , rifles , steel traps for gathering pelts . The third carried furniture : Victorian love seats , armoires , beds with richly carved roses , dressers , commodes , pier mirrors , hatstands in walnut and oak . On the fourth floor Andrewes established living quarters . <p> There are still folk in this town who remember Andrewes as an old , old man greeting dawn above the eastern range of mountains . By then , any consequences of Andrewes ' actions lived among us . None of us can say that he engaged in criminal acts , but all of us know that he lived comfortably among those who did . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He discounted large orders of merchandise to men who dealt in marginally legal business , or in business that was neither moral or legal . People who remember Andrewes picture him standing on his fourth floor balcony , and he is clothed in proper Victorian attire . His hands reach toward the mountains , beckoning in the dawn , or , as some grumblers complain , calling for rooming light to dispel his self-inflicted darkness . <p> By then and honorably , he was long married , siring sons Edward and Charles . And , by then , he was more wraith than man . The fine English figure became diminutive over years . Late one night he visited his sons in their rooms , spoke to his sons kindly , then departed . His physician suggested that Andrewes wafted away on winds because he weighed less than his clothes . Andrewes disappeared in 1935 . <p> His sons , Edward and Charles , continued to mind the store and these two would , through the years , come to depend on their reliable employee James . <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus allowed to take you by the arm as we stroll past echoes of horror . Although I tell the tale as if " we , " the people of the town are speaking , it 's obvious a single person pens these words . I introduce myself as Baruch , a modem scribbler of records . During those times when I do not scribble , I make my living selling old books from a storefront on Ocean Street . Local opinion holds me as surly , aging , irascible , crusty  --  in short , a curmudgeon  --  and I foster the illusion . <p> But , Gentle Reader , since we are unlikely ever to meet , I need not be curmudgeonly with you . In fact , I beg your indulgence . <p> For a long time no one knew or cared where James spent his sleeping hours . If asked , we might suspicion that he never left the store . After all , did he not always range from cellar to fourth floor of that mammoth enterprise ? Did he not continually move , nearly ghost-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix ? The man and the store intermingled . Only recently did we townspeople begin to fear . Inquiry brought discovery . James walks as a symbol of fear more dreadful than any of us have , heretofore , owned the courage to imagine . <p> James , we now understand , steps nightly from his round of groceries , walks the short distance to the harbor ; is then swallowed by the tides , only to be spit ashore half an hour before the store opens . James sleeps , or walks , or God-knows-what beneath those waves . He in no manner resembles the living dead , is not a zombie . Such creatures walk the realms of the fantastic . About that reliable employee James , there is nothing fantastic . <p> We turn now , you and I , to a burden weighing heavy in this tale . That burden is the entire Victorian period , and Victorian dreams that toil and churn and thrust from the past ; the calamities and the curse . <p> They saw themselves , those olden Englishmen , as bearers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set forth as missionaries to dark races , bringing Bibles and rifles and machines . They acted , sometimes unwisely , and did not understand the effects of their actions . Nations fell before them . In their grandest hours they bowed to the highest forms of duty , for " duty " intertwined them like strands of rope . The proper Victorian feared failure to his duty more than he feared dying . <p> They also spoke of purity , were sternly fascinated with sex , and romantically fascinated with death . They dreamed of progress as they fashioned the Industrial Revolution . It takes no scribbler of antiquities to note Victorian styles still alive within us . Are we not bound by duty , ofttimes obscene ? Do we not bore the world with eternal tut-tuts and quacks concerning sex ? Have we not turned technology into a hotly forged divinity ? Are not most places close to them in spirit ? Do we not now pilfer souls , whereas Victorians boldly stole them ? Which brings us back to the reliable James . <p> Once the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after business hours , visited the store and asked James , " Whatever in the bird-brained world was he doing ? " ; which in this small town is the best we can manage in the way of diplomacy . James replied , but not distantly , that he " paid attention to his own business . " He added that he was " minding the store . " <p> The store has changed little during the 20th century , and to the store I went on behest of the mayor , for I am the town historian . James stood beneath soft light through stained glass . Fresh cabbages lay boxed at his feet . He made check marks on a packing list . His employers worked elsewhere : Edward handling receipts and deposits , Charles , who in his age is still sprightly , attending the cash register . Fatigue lined James 's face , but his erect posture denied tiredness that drove bone deep . Groceries encircled him . In the cellar , beneath our feet , ranged drill presses and parts for modern tractors . Above us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manila rope and fishing gear . <p> " The mayor is a proud though foolish man , " I told James . " He is also vexed . " <p> " The mayor runs a feed lot , " James replied in a soft voice . " He fattens stock . Nothing foolish about it for as long as folks need beef . " Always before , James carried a Victorian reserve . Now his voice held quiet compassion . Thin brown hair lay sideways across his skull in vague attempt to cloak a bald spot . Large hands with stubby nails carried callus from years of stocking merchandise . Brown eyes were guileless as a child 's , though somehow moist . In any dry goods store he would be directed to ready-made shirts and pants marked " medium . " <p> His reply slowed me for a moment . Although I 'm in trade , I 've never regarded my bookstore as a holy habitation . James spoke in Victorian terms . To him , the mayor 's feed lot justified the mayor 's ambitions . Victorians truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a great mercantile nation . <p> " Even were the mayor an angel , " I replied , " you beg the question . You are presently the only subject of conversation . Our ladies suggest iniquities , our loafers make uncomfortable jokes , and our banker fears for business . You will soon be the subject of sermons . " <p> " Business picked up last month . " James folded invoices and looked across racks of foodstuff like a father regarding a favorite child . <p> " Because you are notorious . " <p> " ' Afflicted ' is a better word . I could tell you more , but there 's enough sorrow in the world , so I 'll not add to it . Let us please allow ' afflicted ' to be the last word . " His was an anguished and weary spirit in a fatigued body , but only a sharp eye could uncover his distress . Victorians never blinked before a downturn in fortune . He lighted in me a spark of compassion . <p> " I am not as harsh as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is not ungentlemanly to accept assistance . " <p> It was he who viewed me with compassion , looking beyond me finally to our quiet streets . " There 's enough trouble for everyone , " he whispered . " I should say no more . " <p> Momentary terror walked across my soul . I stood among cabbages burnished with light through stained glass windows . Only the banality of the store shone true , for all else seemed filled with threat . The terror passed . My mind changed from fear to hideous and alien knowledge that said I grow old in an alien country . I age in a shameless nation of strange language , which has no respect for old men . <p> " I do not understand , " I told James in parting , " but fear that I will . " I stepped from the store and into our streets . <p> Was James a modem Jonah  --  swallowed by the tides then belched ashore  --  and was not Jonah 's sin the sin of Pride ? I walked toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victorian mansions glowered in company with rusting house trailers . A few split levels nested beside two storey frames ; yet Victorian houses dominated . Before the turn of the century this town lay awash in wealth . Its fortunes saw decline when the first transcontinental railroad drove to tidewater at a different port . These great houses rose from trade ; but trade not always luminous . Irish serving girls earned fifty cents a week , plus stingy room and board . Chinese bond slaves cooked lime and died in thousands . Indian and Malay prostitutes fell ravaged before sailors and disease . Fortunes flowered from that infamous poppy , opium . <p> I felt the press of antique darkness . Andrewes ' spirit still touches here . Too many people died badly in these parts . Some townsfolk claim to hear spectral voices in the wind , or distant weeping at the beginning of each new day . Dirges moan beyond the cause of simple avarice . In the name of progress young boys died from shanghai to merchant ships . Indian children saw their parents lynched . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chain and dropped them screaming overboard ; while in these great houses sounded tinkling notes from harpsichords , sounded the assured voices of wealthy men , the lyrical voices of their ladies . <p> At the harbor water moved like restless spirits . We live precariously beside this sea . Darkness rises from all horizons , but it is dark waters that beckon us . Every year a boat or two is drowned . Many , many hulks of sailing ships , coal burning ships , and modern steamers moulder beneath these waters . <p> What must James see beneath the waves ? Skeletons , no doubt , skeletons representing failed hopes . He must see fortunes in cargo , even cargo once destined for Andrewes ' store . Perhaps he wanders beneath crystal chandeliers waving in water above dance floors of ships ' salons . Our remaining piers stand above great darkness , and the pull of the sea draws that irrational part of our minds to self destruction . <p> IT 'S ABLE ANDREWES , " Mamie Worthy told me when I encountered her at our Carnegie library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of things . " Mamie is as old as Edward and Charles , which is to say she is eighty ; twenty years older than I. She takes her last name more seriously than she ought . In her case , duty asks inquiry into all of town life . She can trace the lineage of every cat and dog , can predict births occurring fewer than nine months after marriage , and knows when a preacher stumbles in prayer , and why . Mamie 's is not the voice of mirth , the voice of gladness . At the same time she is honest . <p> " I do not like you , " she told me , " but that 's not news . The news is why I do not like you . You are a lonely man who protects himself with loneliness . The rest of the town just thinks you 're a snot . " <p> " Yet , I like you , " I replied with all truthfulness . " With the length of your nose from prying I should not , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born and two years after James saw life . By then Edward was twenty , and Charles nineteen . How can Able Andrewes have aught to do with us ? " <p> Brightness faded briefly from her eyes . Her black dress , clean pressed and ankle length , seemed more alive than she . Sadness overcame her face . " I do not give a holy hoot what people do , " she told me . " If you think there 's a contradiction I 'll remind you that you are a grown man who digs at the past like a dog after small bones . You figure it out . " <p> " I like you , " I told her , " not because you offer pleasure or charm , but because until now you have always been honest . " <p> " You chose to remain in this town , " she said in a voice a little larger than a whisper . " Why ? " <p> " It has always been my home . " My response was not sufficient , but I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you away . Your answer will be found in the realm of Able Andrewes ' dreams . I 'll Say no more . " She turned from me . Her black skirts whispered like the tears of widowhood . <p> Victorian secrecy caused loneliness , and I returned to Victorian streets . Mamie is acute , though I resented her comments . I reminded myself that a man with books is never lonely . Because a man chooses not to marry , or sit at the local cafe and talk crops or business spells nothing . And , all men age in a strange land because styles change and youth is ignorant . The landscape of memory becomes more real than modem landscape . <p> Mamie seemed inhibited . I sought one who is not . Our town drunk in no manner resembles the humorous Irishman so beloved by storytellers . He is Swede Andersen , a tall and broad man in his day , who in other days fisted sail . Vessels with auxiliary sail coasted these shores into the 1930s . <p> " Mamie takes things personal , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrewes , it 's the store . Come to think of it , it 's both . " His diminished frame anchored the comer stool of our only tavern . Beyond windows , gray light walked the horizon . It wrapped around a fishing vessel swimming moderately heavy seas . Swede 's hands swell large around a beer glass , his knuckles dislodged in old accidents and fights . The rest of him seems no more than a cameo . <p> " How inebriated are you ? " <p> " As well as can be expected , " he told me , " but suds do n't make me talk . I 'd tell you anyway . " Eyes of thin blue , decorated with lines of red , watched the fishing vessel . " Damn fools , " he said about the fishermen , but his voice was filled with longing for the sea . " This business of getting old sure makes a leila think . " <p> " I have all afternoon , " I told him , " and the will to listen . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a wonder most of us ai n't with him for the stroll . We 're part of the store . You think I drink for fun ? " Swede watched a young couple with a small child as they passed along the boardwalk . " Kids figure the world got made an hour before they were born , " Swede said about the couple . " James sure thought that way . " <p> Swede 's tale meandered , but gradually told of waste and sorrow . It centered on a daily round of innocuous tasks and perceptions . At eighteen James left for college and found no joy . He returned claiming study as impractical . The reliable James took a job at Andrewes store . He became reserved and distant . <p> " So he made a punk 's decision at eighteen , " Swede said , " and never looked back . He became the world 's leading expert on that store ; every nook and cranny and item in stock . To this day he can still find button hooks that ai n't been used since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his actions . " <p> " It likely does , " Swede told me , " if you think about the Andrewes store and Andrewes . You probably figure that store stays alive because of the town , and you figure wrong . The store is what holds all the power here . The town stays alive because of the store . " <p> For a moment it seemed I owned someone else 's memory , or someone else owned mine . Once , long ago , I wished to really study history , and really write it . Now I only record the events of a Victorian town gone stale . <p> " We all stayed too long , " Swede said , " we stayed too long . Check with Mad Willie for the rest of it . He 's the only sane man in town . " <p> " And you are not ? " <p> " I 'm part of the store , " Swede said , and said it sadly . " So are you , but Willie , nope . " Swede returned to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiots , Willie is not easily found . I walked , knowing a day or two might pass before we met . One generally discovers Mad Willie in search for mushrooms and roots and herbs , or conversing with cattle in a near valley . His Indian and Filipino forebears combine in his sturdy frame . He strolls costumed in ragtag clothing from charity bins of churches . Animals delight in his presence , and children follow him until called away by fearful parents . <p> Gentle Reader , some Victorians were honest men and true , as , sometimes , are we . I must not debase a hundred years of toil without exceptions . And , when the rapacious 19th century gave way to the 20th , only the century changed . Victorian minds and values did not disappear because of dates on a calendar . Notions of " progress " continued . Nineteenth century trading posts would be replaced by a beatitude of goods in 20th century shopping malls . <p> And we , like they , write history every day while horror walks . We plant gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning bills while statesmen name themselves honorable men . This augers ill . Able Andrewes , gentleman , did not intentionally join in corruption , but corruption reaches forth and implicates . Victorians killed hundreds of thousands , while Andrewes ' trade built this town . Victorian houses , once gorgeous , line our streets . We live in them , preserve them , and our century kills millions . <p> I stood before dawn outside Andrewes ' store . James would soon arrive , and through the early streets our people passed : Paul Stenkey trudging toward the post office where he will sort and curse colorful flyers advertising goods , Madge Plummer to the weekly paper where she will report quibbles from city hall , and Jason Preston , young developer who is always three dollars short and two days late . I thought of long nights of correspondence at my store . Much of my income derives from rare books sold by mail to collectors . <p> Lights flared from the store as the Andrewes boys prepared for the business day . The store towered in darkness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The windows rose like candles , or like colorful lamps of Victorian pride . Red and purple and blue mixed with oranges , yellows , greens , and browns . Here and there a spark of crystal twinkled , and here and there other glass shone black as polished ebony . Figures in stained glass  --  fishermen and loggers , carpenters and peat miners , draftsmen and bartenders  --  seemed to move because of the mist , slowly counting days of endless toil . Far away a church bell tolled . <p> " Willie heard you calling , " a voice said behind me . I turned to find Mad Willie dressed as a harlequin ; faded yellow pants , red shirt , green cap . Willie may be mad , but he is well read , having mooched my castoff books for years . His broad , olive-colored face shone with enthusiasm . He carried bunches of wild carrots and wild celery . <p> " I did n't call . " <p> " You did , " he said , " or else it 's magic . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cows do n't miss much . Some are even Methodist . " He perfervidly began to explain bovine doctrines . <p> " We have a mystery unlikely solved by cows , " I told him . <p> " Unlikely solved by anyone else , " he told me , " plus some are Presbyterian . " He watched through dark mist as a milk truck pulled up before the store . The driver stepped slowly down , as if in dispraise of cows . " Miraculous , " Willie breathed . " You put in grass , and out comes milk and cheese and ice cream . " His delight sounded as large as his wonder . <p> " Something dark stalks this town , " I said . " James has become peculiar in his way . His reserve is gone and he speaks most kindly . Swede drinks but does n't care for it . Mamie is indifferent to events , and yet she pries . No one claims to fully understand . If someone does understand , that someone is n't talking . " <p> " James does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do yours . Able Andrewes does his , and maybe some of what happens is wonderful . " For a moment the man seemed sane . His lips lost their silly smile , and his broad forehead furrowed with concentrated thought . <p> " There 's wonderment to it , " I said with grim voice , " but other words occur . Horror and death , for two . " <p> " Celery , " said Willie , and not unhappily . " Apium graveolens . In the wild state it is as rank as me , but with broader leaves . It is indigenous to marshy places near the sea . With breeding and blanching celery tums tame . Three varieties are cultivated , green , white , and red . Green is best , but James is white . Very little of the red shows up around here . " <p> " You must be feigning madness , " I told him , " while playing court jester spinning riddles . " It is impossible to dislike Willie , but also impossible not to become impatient with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Willie said with dignity . " Do not speak of sanity and riddles in the same breath . Your sanity disappeared when you stopped fiddling . When questions cease , people buy someone else 's dream . " <p> " As James bought Andrewes ' dream ? " <p> " And Andrewes , no doubt , bought an even older dream , " Willie murmured , sounding his sadness . " Steam power was first used in 1698 by Englishmen , the same year Daniel Defoe suggested better roads and insane asylums . " Willie looked toward cathedral windows still illuminated by electricity , more than by the first thin light of dawn . " Borrow all good dreams , " he whispered , " but in the name of holy spirits do n't buy them . When you buy , you may own something good , but you also own whatever evil those dreams spawned . " <p> " James is not without honor , " I said , feeling somehow that I defended myself more than I defended James . <p> " James is in the thrall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes because he has nothing left to lose . And , the store is in the thrall of an elder dream . " He cocked his head as if hearing distant voices in the mist . " They sometimes wail at sunrise , " he trilled . " Sad spirits call from shallow graves where progress placed them . Oh , this town once produced evil , evil , evil , yes it did . " <p> " But Andrewes only bought and sold : " <p> " And Andrewes wished to honorably work , and honorably raise children , and honorably grow old , and honorably die . But when a man begins to slide it seems like all creation gets greased up for the occasion . Andrewes became implicated . The store became greater than he . The store became the dream . " Willie pointed to cathedral windows aglow with Victorian ideals , and with work of Victorian hands . His face wrenched with a silly smile , but his voice sounded low , bereaved , whispering horror . " And there he sits , there he sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choked , and pointed to a small space high on one window , a window overlooking the harbor . " See how slowly he works because he is old , " Willie said bemused , though still muttering as if through pain . " He is old , old , old , and yet he will never die because his sentence is not death , but dying . " Willie continued to point . " Dying but never dead for as long as dreams that put him there exist . " <p> Like cattle , we do not look up , yet walk beneath the stars . I turned to those windows I have passed for six decades , seeing but not seeing ; turned toward glass which held the small , black-suited figure of Able Andrewes , his soul become one with his windows . Andrewes , disappearing , but forever present . The dark figure hunched before an account book . A quill pen moved with glacial slowness , yet moved . About him other figures moved , but glacially . <p> It is the mist I told myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mamie know of this , did Swede ? How many knew , yet feared to give their knowledge voice ? Did James know ? And Charles and Edward , working each day beside this grim eternity ? <p> And yes , James knew , but with charity of newly discovered kindness kept quiet . <p> " Andrewes tends the store , " Willie said , " and so does James . The wild carrot , Daucus carota , a member of the family Umbelliferae . . . . " <p> I turned from Willie , knowing that I would soon be shaking ; knowing also , because I am old , that this horror must soon pass into a greater horror . Andrewes ' quill pen moved , although one must concentrate to see it , for the life of the windows breathes slowly ; ancient vapors ; Victorian men and ladies caught in near stasis between half-known dreams . <p> And , yes , James knew . I thought of my own daily round , and the rounds of others in this town while understanding James ; that master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , within the holds of sunken ships , and beside skeletons that once knew dreams . James , a creature of the store , inventorying drowned cargo destined for the store . James , a creature stepping always in behalf of the store , stepping more slowly each year ; but always stepping . That genius of inventory . <p> And yes , I knew that all of us are creatures of the store . We bought Andrewes ' dream . The store could not have gained such power otherwise . Now a violent circle closes with quiet violence . When the store became the dream , it made the dream immortal . We are trapped . The future becomes a dirge , helling through heat of day and frost of night above the bones of our fathers . <p> I might have been a prophet instead of a scribbler , or a true historian rather than a recorder of facts . I might not have been lonely . And , my fellow townsmen , what might they have been ? No matter . In a way I am not lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his stained glass - trapped with less grace than a bee embalmed in amber , for the bee is dead  --  while we are only , and eternally  --  dying . Mamie will eternally gossip . Swede will eternally drink . I will eternally sell old dreams as the newspaper prints old news . Able Andrewes , green grocer , will keep accounts . I turned toward the harbor . <p> The reliable James appeared , walking toward me through mist to become my comrade as we plod through time . From somewhere in the mist Willie hummed a hymn to morning . James stopped before me . <p> " It is n't so bad , " he said quietly . " But it does go on and on . " His moist eyes dulled beyond horror , could no longer see horror . For a moment he trembled , thus still knew some emotion . " People do need things , " he said , and visibly controlled his trembling , " but I suppose we should warn the children . " Then he tasted the futility of his statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaguely , and moved toward the store . <p> I felt not fear , but anger , and the need to strike . It was a loathsome need . No man of honor , no gentleman , could answer this blow with cruelty . When there is nothing left to lose , one must at least answer as James does , with kindness . <p> Thin sunlight cut the mist , and stained glass windows dulled before me , Gentle Reader ; dulled before me like slow movement through slow aeons . There was aught to say except give thanks  --  thanks  --  that  --  at least  --  you are spared : for surely you are wise , and do not buy other people 's dreams . Surely you , unlike we , are not tending the store ; are not , because of the store , enthroned by time forever , or , because of the store , forever perishing . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> <p> By Jack Cady <p> Jack Cady 's first story for F &SF,; " The Night We Buried Road Dog " ( January , 1993 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is also a nominee for the Stoker award and for the Hugo award .
