<p> When the mood strikes him , Robert Ybarra can spend hours alone in his dimly lit downstairs bedroom , waging adrenaline-pumping battles across the violent landscape of his computer screen until day and night become irrelevant and his mom begins to wonder . <p> Soft-spoken and bright , the 18-year-old Ybarra dropped out of high school to focus on his affinity for computers , an interest honed to a sharp edge on games mastered with shotguns , rocket launchers and other instruments of virtual destruction . <p> He is ruthlessly good , perhaps the best in Colorado at blasting his enemies to tiny , pixelated bits . <p> ' My mom 's always joking around : ' You 're not going to go crazy , are you ? " says Ybarra , an easygoing kid from a middle-class Colorado Springs neighborhood . ' But she knows I 'm a normal person . I 'm not going to do something like that . ' <p> Captivated by competition and propelled by technology , Ybarra belongs to an evolving pop subculture - one heavily weighted toward youth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , on the burgeoning popularity of violent computer games . <p> Investigations into recent high-profile killings have focused not only on the hard hearts of the youthful gunmen , but the hard drives inside their computers . Now , a tide of criticism suggests a connection between the carnage portrayed in so-called ' first-person shooters ' - games in which the player blazes through a virtual world - and a parallel violent reality . <p> Real-life teen gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold played the games before their Columbine High School massacre left 15 dead . And 14-year-old West Paducah , Ky. , shooter Michael Carneal , whose school rampage killed three , had a fascination with the games that has triggered a lawsuit by victims ' families seeking to hold manufacturers partially liable . <p> A handful of killers has grabbed headlines , but years of research so far reveal no conclusive evidence that the games breed murderers . <p> Indeed , a vast virtual society quietly and unobtrusively pursues a leisure-time obsession that has found a niche in teen bedrooms and corporate boardrooms . One British company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its investment-banker clientele as heavily armed space marines in cyber-battles described as being ' like a weekend of Outward Bound . ' <p> In the beginning , gamers cut their teeth on Atari and Apple IIs , or spent hours enthralled with Intellivision , Nintendo and other console games . More recently , the Internet has given them a worldwide playground utterly impervious to constraints of time and place . <p> Real-time chat provides a means of instant communication , and hundreds of interlinked Web sites chronicle the culture through its own alternative media , which gamers attend with the same ritual devotion mainstream culture accords the daily paper . <p> ' It 's all fused together with computers , ' says Jason Carlton , a renowned 21-year-old gamer from San Francisco . ' There 's no suitable analogy because there 's been nothing like it . The community has only been developing for half a decade . ' <p> Gradually shedding its stereotype as the sole refuge of computer geeks and societal outcasts , the computer game culture has come to embrace a wider demographic . <p> Although teens still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reached $ 5.5 billion last year , more adults - and women in particular - are discovering the virtual violence of cyberspace as a social , rather than anti-social , phenomenon . <p> ' For every loner who goes off the deep end , there are probably thousands who find a place they belong , ' says Henry Jenkins , a professor of comparative media studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and , as parent of a teen son and housemaster of a 150-student dormitory , an interested observer of pop culture . <p> ' It 's true of gaming communities , like any other - it opens up social interaction , even if the content of what they 're playing is aggressive , and the imagery is violent . This new form of play is not something we grew up with , and it 's viewed with suspicion because it 's new - and kids claim ownership .

Its creator , id Software of Mesquite , Texas , estimates that 15 million copies of the game have been downloaded worldwide . <p> Quake , a later id creation , and its subsequent incarnations have since surpassed versions of Doom as the game of choice in the competitive computer game culture in which Harris and Klebold considered themselves cyber-citizens . <p> The game itself has evolved from a strategic exercise in mass carnage , in which a player destroys dozens of artificial foes en route to his goal , to current versions that are largely multi-player affairs matching live opponents . <p> Locally or over the Internet , contestants match wits and weapons in individual and team formats . The multi-player , online capability has revolutionized first-person shooters with software engines that send players careening through the maze of graphics-intense environments with stomach-churning speed . <p> It also heightened the sense of community within the hard-core culture . <p> ' There 's a big social aspect , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 24-year-old single mom and avid player from Nova Scotia who works for the All Games Network , an online gaming site .

' <p> Local area networks attract gamers <p> The Internet remains the most heavily traveled route to competition , but enthusiasts also have developed a more concrete social outlet for their virtual society - the LAN party . <p> LANs , short for local area networks , provide the impetus for gamers to actually get together , link their computers and engage in a competitive communion that resembles a modern marriage of the microprocessor and the all-night poker game . From a gathering at a friend 's house to dozens of people pitching in to rent space in a hotel or a college , the LAN feeds the computer-game jones of the truly hard-core . <p> ' I never saw it as far out of the mainstream , ' says Charles Bedford , a Golden technical support engineer whose ' Bedlam ' tournaments blazed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular events . <p> In August , Bedford drove his prized red Corvette - vanity license plate BEDMAN , after his screen name - to Texas to participate in one of the biggest LANs of them all . The annual QuakeCon bash draws hundreds to what amounts to a convention of the computer game culture . <p> In January , Bedford and friends will host the millennium edition of their annual Bedlam tournament , a three-day event that is aiming for 300 contestants and likely will be the largest gaming LAN ever in Colorado . <p> On a less formal basis , kids such as 17-year-old buddies Ben DeLong and Jesse Migchelbrink , Arvada high school students , have stepped up their childhood involvement with computer games and spend hours playing in their homes - and even longer at LANs . <p> ' We 'll stay up for a few days at a time , ' DeLong says .

' It 's all about strategy . ' <p> A ' chess club kid ' in high school , Edwards simply loves the competition - particularly team games like the Capture the Flag variation of Quake . He also savors the virtual contacts with other players that turn into actual relationships when he meets them at LANs . <p> ' I 've met people who 'll be friends for life , ' he says .

But often , when people meet him at LAN parties , they find a kinder , gentler personality - although no less competitive . <p> ' Talking smack is just funny , ' Ybarra shrugs . ' People get ticked off , but sooner or later I just tell them to chill . The thing about talking smack is people get scared of you . But this is the way I am , kind of laid back . Even girls have said I 'm too nice . ' <p> At LANs , the games sometimes go on for days , often fueled by junk food or , at the far end of an extended competition , breakfast . <p> ' The beautiful thing is that everyone puts their differences aside , has one thing in common and gets along , ' says 23-year-old Pete Yellen , an Aurora systems engineer . ' It 's a real positive atmosphere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A cheap date for mom and dad <p> Todd and Aurora Ellison sit at separate computer monitors just a few feet apart , guiding animated figures through a maze of doors and walls and dodging the spiraling rays of enemies - online friends from across North America , connected to their Thornton home by the Internet . <p> They return fire with their own deadly blasts . When Todd drops his wife 's character with a nifty shot , he turns to Aurora and offers a sheepish smile . <p> ' Sorry , ' he says politely . <p> They are a mid-20s married couple - he 's a Web site designer and she 's a grocery checker - and consider themselves conscientious parents of two boys , 6 and 2 . They 're also hard-core gamers , and perceive a night on the ' Net playing Quake as a cheap date . <p> Sometimes they let their older son play , but they hammer home that it 's just pretend . <p> ' I try to teach my sons to respect others and themselves , ' says Aurora , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . ' But you ca n't shelter them and say there 's no violence . I 'd rather my kids get their aggression out on this ( computer ) , right here , than out on the street . ' <p> Todd holds up a shirt popular among gamers grown tired of the talk about how violence seeps from their games into impressionable minds . Made by the online gaming site Heat.net , it says : ' Cyber-bullets cause no pain . ' <p> But do they shape the minds of the kids who immerse themselves in the crossfire ? Studies over the past two decades have produced no concrete clinical correlation , but present a smorgasbord of findings : <p> Six percent of secondary school children questioned in a 1991 study were defined as ' pathological players , ' drawn to video games by what was described as a ' non-substance form of addiction . ' <p> A 1996 study of 900 fourth- through eighth-graders found that almost half of their favorite games fell into the categories of fantasy violence or human violence . Girls preferred the games with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In three studies examining a possible link between the games and real-life behavior , conducted between 1984 and 1992 , two found that heavy video-game use among middle- and high school students triggered aggressive attitudes , but one found that such play had a calming effect . <p> Two more studies , in 1995 and ' 97 , concluded that the popular notion that the games caused aggressive behavior was plagued by inconsistencies and lack of concrete data . <p> The reliability of any study of computer games is clouded by the rapid improvements in graphics technology that help the gaming experience more closely imitate real life . Consequently , the visual intensity of violent computer games is a constantly changing variable . <p> ' The reality of the game is subjective - it depends on how you view reality in the first place , ' says Jason Carlton , the San Francisco gamer who belongs to the nationally renowned Death Row clan . ' I like to watch scary movies , play scary games . But I can step away . Some might feed off it . It influences you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at a game and become murderers . <p> ' But maybe it was a catalyst . ' <p> Critics decry games ' violence <p> A wave of critics , led by former West Point psychology professor-turned-author David Grossman , believe the violent computer games are all that - and more . <p> ' The people who live on those computers are so isolated from reality that they 're able to convince themselves that their fantasy is reality , ' says Grossman . <p> He wrote a Pulitzer Prize-nominated book on the psychological cost of killing and more recently authored ' Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill , ' which specifically addresses the effects of violent media . Testifying at a post-Columbine Senate hearing that addressed the subject , he repeated his theory that violent computer games desensitize kids to real-life violence . <p> ' The overall dynamic of developing a fantasy world and turning their dark , twisted fantasies into your reality is what violent computer games introduce , ' Grossman says . <p> Not so fast with the point-and-click indictment , say others . <p> Jenkins , the MIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt politicians staged to frame the issue wholly out of context and , essentially , put pop culture on trial . <p> ' We heard senators talk about games they never played , movies they 've never seen , music they never listened to , ' he says . ' The fact that each generation attacks new forms of culture they 're not familiar with , and panics over the content calls into question whether it 's really leading us to hell in a handbasket . ' <p> Games a convenient scapegoat ? <p> Software makers such as id and Ion Storm , respective companies of Doom creators John Carmack and John Romero , remain mostly silent on the violence controversy they helped engender . But some computer gamers and industry figures advance another theory : first-person shooters are simply convenient scapegoats for incomprehensible crimes . <p> Garth Chouteau , a spokesman for game site pogo.com and a 2-year-old competitive professional gaming league , compares the current rumblings about violent computer games to the ruckus kicked up by rock ' n ' roll in the ' 50s . <p> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were doing stuff with it their parents did n't understand , ' he says . ' By default , that made it of questionable quality and virtue or moral background . If kids in 1956 had taken guns to school and done bad things , people would have attributed it to Little Richard and Chuck Berry . ' <p> If any single study gets to the heart of the controversy over violent computer games , it just might be one that addressed the information gap between young gamers and their parents . It focused not on the disparity in technical knowledge - which is growing - but basic cultural awareness . <p> The survey , done by the National Institute on Media and the Family , found that 80 percent of high school kids were familiar with the popular first-person shooter called ' Duke Nukem . ' <p> Their parents ? Only 5 percent had even heard of it . <p> Lawsuit blames games for shootings <p> When Jack Thompson talks about the makers of violent computer games , the Florida attorney bluntly refers to them as ' the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He calls the Columbine massacre ' the Pearl Harbor of America 's culture war . ' <p> Do n't tell him cyber-bullets cause no pain . <p> The lawsuit he and co-counsel Mike Breen have filed in federal court presumes just the opposite : that first-person shooters of the Doom and Quake variety are at least partly responsible for the actions of Michael Carneal , the 14-year-old boy who in 1997 shot eight classmates at his West Paducah , Ky. , high school and killed three of them . <p> The lawsuit , filed on behalf of victims ' families , names 25 assorted entertainment companies , including 18 parties involved in the design , manufacturer or distribution of violent video games . Thompson asserts that , ' certain entertainment products are the legal cause of certain harms . ' <p> ' I 've dealt with sociopaths in the entertainment industry since 1987 , ' Thompson says . ' These people have a motivation beyond money . It 's convenient that they make money , but they 're parading their perversion and getting off on it . ' <p> Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big hit when a sketchy profile of Eric Harris emerged in the media , casting the Columbine shooter as a social misfit who deplored a school where athletes were revered and jock culture celebrated . <p> But it was n't just his computer game playing that jolted public sensibilities - it was the possibility that he may have used the games to plot his rampage . In his America Online profile , he described himself as a ' professional doom and doom2 creator . ' <p> Harris designed different levels of the games , including one purported to represent Columbine High School . Level design is a common exercise among hard-core gamers , who consider it harmless fun - and sometimes profitable - to construct new venues for virtual violence . <p> Apartment a setting for game <p> Jason Spencer , a 23-year-old self-described computer nerd , surprised his mother one day as a teenager by firing up the family computer and showing her a level of Doom set in their apartment , including details of the surrounding garden and yard . Their three cats and a dog had been turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mom was fascinated by her son 's technical abilities . <p> ' I thought it was really cool he was creating , ' says his mother , Tanya McCandlish , a health care consultant . ' So I threw some things at him , like architecture . I still drop a line every now and then - ' Why do n't you take some architecture classes ? " <p> Her response is n't uncommon among parents who , if not particularly enamored with the games their kids play or the hours the games consume , see a redeeming value in the technology the games can teach - and the employment opportunities that know-how might open . <p> Spencer does dabble in architecture , if only by poring over Frank Lloyd Wright designs so he can lend futuristic style to his own creations as a freelance level designer for a software company . He snuffs out Camel filters in a skull-shaped ashtray and keeps a can of Dr Pepper close at hand as he painstakingly manipulates forms on a grid , creating interactive worlds where virtual dramas will eventually play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence , ' says Spencer , who shares an Aurora townhouse with his mother . ' When I got my first paying contract , it was like , ' Whoaaa ! " <p> With the April 20 Columbine massacre , Harris , with the help of Klebold , took the level-making exercise to real life . And within 24 hours , the Doom level of the high school Harris created had spread via Internet across the globe to gamers curious to see what the killer had wrought . <p> Technically , they judged it a bland and amateurish effort , reflecting Harris ' mediocre gaming abilities . For all his talk , Harris was not a particularly accomplished player , and those who encountered him contend that he lurked only on the fringes of the computer game culture . <p> Edwards , the 40-year-old Aurora player , says he saw in Harris none of the digital trash-talk he sometimes sees from younger players . <p> ' He seemed like everyone else , ' Edwards says . ' He respected me - maybe because I beat him every time I played him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark or black about the guy . The whole thing was shocking to me . ' <p> Kids can buy any game <p> What many critics of violent computer games find almost as shocking as the games themselves is that kids like Harris , Klebold and Carneal - or thousands of others who play first-person shooters - are able to purchase them in the first place . <p> In 1994 , the Interactive Digital Software Association , a leading trade group , established the Entertainment Software Rating Board - arguably one of the most thorough ratings mechanisms in the modern media . <p> And also one of the most ignored . <p> On its Web site , the association rates 3,917 computer games , ranging from ' early childhood ' to ' adults only . ' The vast majority - 73 percent - fall into three categories all deemed appropriate for kids . Of the remaining 27 percent , most are recommended for teens 13 and older , while fewer than 300 games are rated for mature players or adults only . <p> But who pays attention ? A survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year found that only 21 percent of retail and rental stores had policies about handing over mature games to minors . <p> While acknowledging the element of violence in some popular software , many gamers contend that first-person shooters are just high-tech descendants of fondly remembered childhood games - ' Cowboys and Indians ' comes up most often - in which violence has always been equally implied , but without the graphic spatter . <p> Pete Yellen , the systems engineer from Aurora , takes that theory one step further and reduces first-person shooters to a common denominator . <p> ' It 's just like playing tag when you 're a kid , ' he says . ' You 're just trying to click on a guy faster than he can click on you . It 's not about who can kill who . You 're just substituting the word ' kill ' for ' tag . " <p> Gore gets more and more realistic <p> That 's little consolation to critics who cringe every time faster processors and slicker graphics cards render more realistic gore . In the parlance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' which denotes a kill , and ' gib , ' which denotes an explosion of computer graphics into a colorful display of virtual viscera . <p> The subculture also has spawned phrases for informal competitions such as Midwest Massacre , City Kill , deathNET , FragStock , Gibstock and Hell-Fest - blatant references to violence that perfectly mirror the dark , self-parodying sense of humor built into some games ' marketing slogans . <p> Advertising has produced some of the most extreme examples of violent imagery . Some specific slogans were raised in the Senate hearings : <p> ' Blowing your friends to pieces with a rocket launcher is only the beginning . ' ' Let the slaughter begin . ' ' As easy as killing babies with axes . ' ' More fun than shooting your neighbor 's cat . ' <p> When it comes to marketing , they go for the jugular . <p> ' I think the biggest vulnerability of the industry is not the games , but the advertising , ' says MIT 's Jenkins . ' In looking for visually striking images , they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lot of the ads are clearly tongue-in-cheek . No one 's saying , ' Go shoot your neighbor 's cat , ' but it appeals to an anti-PC sense of humor . <p> ' We have to be careful the way we read the ads . But they are the weak point in the industry 's case . ' <p> Robert Krakoff , who at 61 resides in La Costa , Calif. - and at the far side of the gaming demographic - has worked as a consultant and brand manager in the computer game industry . And the former UCLA football player and boxer pulls no punches . <p> ' Research has been done , and the truth is gore sells , ' says Krakoff , who now helps market a high-resolution mouse aimed at gamers . ' Since Columbine , I 'm told they 've toned the advertising down tremendously . But the games have not changed . They still make them the way the end-user wants .

They argue the violence represents nothing more serious than the release of pent-up frustration and occasional adolescent angst . <p> It 's just a game , they say . <p> When the trials of teen life set in , Arvadan Ben DeLong cuts loose on virtual beings , who - despite their graphic deaths - can be regenerated with a keystroke . <p> ' Sometimes you get a purely disgusting gib and laugh at it , but it does n't translate to real life , ' Delong says .
