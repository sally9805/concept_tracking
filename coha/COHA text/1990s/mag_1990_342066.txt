Your connecting flight has been delayed another three hours , and you feel as if you are getting a lavender tan from the lighting . You are buzzed on cardboard coffee and too woozy from an airborne snackoid served on your incoming flight to risk alcohol . But do you despair ? Of course you do . Do you give up ? Certainly , by reaching into your flight bag and withdrawing one of this season 's airport novels . You know the kind . Literary wide-bodies with plenty of plot that allow you to leave the real world in the first half paragraph and stay away through several flight-delay announcements . No-qual prose and cereal-box characters are customary , though an occasional lapse into good writing does no harm . The Odyssey and Moby Dick , both wide-bodies before their time , would have been perfect airport novels . Herewith a random grab of half a dozen new airporters , none written by Homer or Herman Melville : <P> LADY BOSS , by Jackie Collins ( Simon &; Schuster ; 608 pages ; $21.95 ) , offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Slowly , languorously " the naughty parts of speech tumble about during the sex scenes . But why are n't the scenes sexier ? Never mind . The point of the story is to watch " darkly , exotically " beautiful but ruthless , yet sensitive and vulnerable female tycoon Lucky Santangelo  --  she heads a billion-dollar shipping company but does n't seem to go to the office much  --  knife her way to ownership of Panther films , a big Hollywood studio . This she does without telling her actor husband ( " Lennie was tall and lanky , with dirty-blond hair and ocean-green eyes " ) , who is having contract troubles with Panther . Alas , she fails to consider that Lennie 's fierce male pride will curdle when she reveals herself as his boss . Disaster ! And he . . . And she . . . <P> MEMORIES OF MIDNIGHT , by Sidney Sheldon ( Morrow ; 399 pages ; $21.95 ) , is one of a large and growing subgenre of evil-Greek-shipowner thrillers . Nasty fellows , those fictional Greek shipowners . This one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unfaithful mistress and her lover , Demiris ' pilot , be executed for the supposed murder of the pilot 's wife , beautiful , trusting American Catherine Alexander . But he is still angry , and he strides about his villa like Richard III , gloating in a long , italic aside about what he is going to do to Catherine , who lost her memory during a boat explosion and has been living in a rich , evil nunnery owned by Demiris . " It 's too bad I ca n't afford to let her live , " he whispers to empty air . " But first  --  my vengeance I 'm going to enjoy myself with her . " Reading Sheldon 's drivel offers an important reassurance : travelers who stick with Demiris and Catherine till the end can endure whatever misery the airlines throw at them .
