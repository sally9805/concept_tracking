Since taking over Fidelity Investments ' struggling Magellan fund last June , Robert Stansky has been the most watched man in mutual funds . Magellan , with $54.7 billion in assets , is the biggest fund in the U.S. Stansky is trying to revive not only Magellan but also with it Fidelity 's tarnished reputation as a money manager . He is making progress . Magellan 's year-to-date return of 13% is better than that of 56% of its rivals but still trails major stock indexes . He talked recently with TIME 'S Sam Allis . <P> TIME : The stock market has been all over the place lately . How nervous should we be ? <P> Stansky : I 'm not counting on a very smooth environment , or straight up or straight down . You get a lot of people with a shorter trigger these days . It 's not like you can go in and buy every stock and just wait until you hit the right price , where your only risk is time . The stocks that come up short in performance numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that get hit very hard and very quickly . <P> TIME : So what kind of an investment strategy does this situation call for ? <P> Stansky : It calls for a two-part strategy : No. 1 , you take what the market gives you . <P> TIME : Meaning do n't get greedy ? <P> Stansky : Meaning you have to be careful in valuations . There are companies out there today that are selling at five- and 10-year highs on valuations . <P> TIME : So we should avoid these stocks ? <P> Stansky : Not necessarily . It also calls for the same thing that I have done every day here , and that is worry about the company 's fundamentals . I ca n't do anything about a war in Algeria . Let 's look at the valuation of a stock relative to the companies in its group and then relative to the whole market . <P> TIME : The market has been led by big companies , and you own a number see chart . Will the FORTUNE 500 hold their strength ? <P> Stansky : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered better earnings growth than the overall market . How did they do that ? They improved the return on capital in the businesses . Expenses were held in control . They took cash out of the business . Bought back stock . Made acquisitions that hopefully will add to the revenue line . If they keep executing the way they have been , they 'll be fine . <P> TIME : Small-company stocks took a beating in the past year . Is there hope ? <P> Stansky : A lot of the small caps ' earnings did not grow as fast because they did n't have exposure to the lower dollar which spurs exports and international business . The multinationals here have 60% of their business outside the U.S. <P> TIME : Let 's talk about Magellan . Where are you invested now ? <P> Stansky : Since the beginning of the year , it has been 95% in equities stocks and less than 5% cash , which is the way I planned to run the fund . Five percent or less cash . <P> TIME : You 're comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm there now with the fund . I own what is in the fund today because I want to own it . Not because I was left with it . <P> TIME : Your predecessor had huge holdings in bonds . How did you sell that position ?
