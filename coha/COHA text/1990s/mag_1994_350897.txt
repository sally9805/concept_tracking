In L.A. Story , his prophetic film satire , Steve Martin portrays a weatherman who at one point is trying to enjoy Sunday brunch in a garden restaurant with friends . Suddenly the sunlit get-together is interrupted by an earthquake . As a neighboring table rattles past them across the floor , its traveling occupants keep chatting without even looking up from their arugula . " How strong is it ? " a guest at Martin 's table inquires blithely . " Oh , " Martin says with a shrug , " I give it a 4 . " <P> If only the rattled citizens of the real Los Angeles could be quite so blase . If only they could take their umpteenth aftershock so much in stride . Instead they are suffering sharp and lingering emotional tremors from the 6.8- magnitude Northridge earthquake on Jan. 17 that killed 57 people and caused $15 billion in damage  --  and they do n't mind showing it . The original hyperactivity  --  and some panic  --  has been followed by delayed shock and a period of numbness , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety . Few doubt that Los Angeles has been taking it harder than San Francisco 's Bay Area did after the Loma Prieta quake of 1989 , which was even greater in intensity  --  7.1  --  and caused 61 deaths . <P> Sherry McClure , 26 , a mortgage-bank clerk in Northridge , sleeps on the kitchen floor , ready to roll under the table when necessary . Phoebe Sharaf , a middle-aged Santa Monica social worker , refuses to go to the movies because she fears dark enclosures . Some Angelenos keep hard hats  --  or even heavy-duty salad bowls to be used as helmets  --  at the ready on their night tables . Others keep a packed bag in their car , parked outside the garage . <P> For many residents the new California dream is to flee the place . In a poll taken during the last week of January by the Field Institute in San Francisco , 26% of Southern Californians surveyed said they had considered moving away because of the quake , more than three times the proportion of Northern Californians harboring such thoughts after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said a Bekins Moving &; Storage Co. executive . " But we 're seeing a significant increase in business from people wanting to leave the area . " <P> With each of the aftershocks , which have totaled more than 5,000 of varying intensity , the fears have assumed a pervasive , even obsessive dimension . One store reported a sudden boom in $2,000 steel-canopy beds capable of withstanding " an entire collapsing roof . " Conversations are dominated by the quake . True tales of the fateful moment at 4:31 a.m. are told and retold : how in one Sherman Oaks home a water bed went wild , flipped its occupant against the ceiling and then heaved him against the wall as though to suffocate him . <P> Among the symptoms of L.A. 's post-traumatic stress disorder are uncontrollable flashbacks , nightmares , hypervigilance and anger about the lack of control over one 's life , according to Mory Framer , clinical director of the ! Barrington Psychiatric Center , which treated more than 1,000 victims . The Northridge quake left two special psychological scars because it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed , thus transforming those two refuges into places of lethal danger . " Here we are , supposed to go back to our homes and back to our beds , but now it is frightening there , " says Framer . Many people , his team discovered , have been waking up at exactly 4:30.
