As a former real estate saleswoman , widow of a judge and mother of a prosecutor , Mary Ann Downs had far more financial and legal acumen than most aging fraud victims . Even so , con artists had little trouble scamming her out of $74,000 . Why ? How ? Her story is a classic study in what makes fraud against elderly people , especially women , one of the biggest growth industries in America . Con men are bilking the elderly out of $40 billion a year , by one FBI estimate . <P> When her ordeal started , Downs was 77 and recently widowed and had just learned she had breast cancer . " I was really at the bottom of the barrel , " she says . " I was living in San Antonio , Texas , where I knew no one . I guess I was lonely . " Right there is a combination that screams " victim . " The American Association of Retired Persons ( A.A.R.P. ) figures that while anyone 60 or older is likely to be on at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 75 or older is virtually guaranteed to be . Like Downs , such women are often widows , lonely and suffering from ills that make them desperate for someone to talk to . <P> They are also usually home at midday and available to take calls from phony telemarketers , far and away the biggest class of crooks preying on the old . Downs ' first caller identified himself as Curt and spoke in the sympathetic tones that often win the trust of a senior . He commiserated with Downs over her troubles and then told her that her luck was changing : she had just won a prize worth tens of thousands of dollars . But to collect it , said Curt , she first had to buy something from a company called Professional Marketing Inc. in Las Vegas . <P> Downs sent a $200 check for a shipment of cosmetics . Instead of the prize , she began getting calls from other telemarketing firms  --  one in Utah , one in Louisiana and four more in Las Vegas . The firms belonged to a new breed of con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mooch lists , at prices ranging from $10 for an untested " lead " to $200 for the name of someone who has fallen for a whole series of scams . <P> Downs ' name must have been pricey . Chasing the ever elusive chimera of a prize , she ordered all sorts of overpriced junk : flimsy telephone-answering machines , tennis bracelets , money clips , hair spray and what was supposed to be two mink coats . " They looked like they 'd been made with rat skins , " says Downs . " I just put the stuff in a room and closed the door . " <P> To this day she can not really explain what happened . " I got into it , and I could n't get out , " she says simply . But she does admit she was terrified of telling her children . That anxiety keeps many other fraud victims falling for new scams in the hope of replacing some of the lost money so their sons and daughters will never know . Says Shelly Feldman , president of a Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their kids will say they ca n't handle their finances and they 'll be put in a nursing home . "
