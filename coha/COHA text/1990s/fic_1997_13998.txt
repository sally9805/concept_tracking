The actors come onstage . The actor playing OSCAR WILDE holds up a copy of De Profundis and reads : @x ( The Judge 's gavel ) NARRATOR 1 London , 3rd of April 1895 . Old Bailey Central Criminal Court . Regina vs . Queensberry . ( Gavel ) NARRATOR 2 ( holding up the book ) : The text of the trials are from the book The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde , compiled by H. Montgomery Hyde from shorthand notes from the trials . Other sources will be indicated . From The Star : NARRATOR 4 ( holding up a newspaper ) : Not for years has the Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey been so densely crowded as it is today . People begged , bullied , and bribed for admission . ( Gavel ) NARRATOR 1 Sir Edward Clarke , the opening speech for the prosecution : ( Gavel ) EDWARD CLARKE May it please you , my lord , gentlemen of the jury . We are here to try Lord Sholto Douglas , the 8th Marquess of Queensberry . NARRATOR 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The charge against him is that he published a false and malicious libel in regard to Mr. Oscar Wilde . The libel was published in the form of a card left by the Marquess at a club to which Mr. Oscar Wilde belonged . It is a visiting card of Lord Queensberry 's with his name printed upon it . p. 4 NARRATOR 1 The court accepts it as Exhibit A. EDWARD CLARKE The card has written upon it : MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY " Oscar Wilde : posing somdomite . " EDWARD CLARKE Of course it is a matter of serious moment that such a libel as that should in any way be connected with a gentleman who has borne a high reputation in this country . NARRATOR 3 From The Echo : NARRATOR 4 Several hours before the day 's business opened at the Old Bailey this morning people were using every effort to gain admission to the old court . Never , perhaps , have so many prominent persons been disappointed to find their prominence would not serve them to gain entrance to a criminal court . EDWARD CLARKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be amongst the finest writers of this century . He represents a form of artistic literature which recommends itself to many of the foremost minds and the most cultivated people.Mr . Wilde is a poet , a novelist , an essayist and a playwright . His last four plays have been great successes in the West End , and two of them are currently being performed there . NARRATOR 3 From The Evening News : p. 5 NARRATOR 1 The importance of being early was never better illustrated than at the Old Bailey this morning when long before 10 o'clock every seat where a pressman could sit had a couple of competitors for it . EDWARD CLARKE The Marquess of Queensberry 's claim to fame is that he patronized the man who designed the rules of boxing that bear his name : " The Queensberry Rules . " ( Laughter in the court ) SIR EDWARD CARSON My lord , I object . JUDGE Sir Edward , please . EDWARD CLARKE Now , the words of the libel are not directly an accusation of the gravest of all offenses  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense , but that in some way or other the person of whom those words were written did appear  --  nay , desired to appear  --  and pose to be a person guilty of or inclined to the commission of the gravest of all offenses . You will appreciate that the leaving of such a card openly with the porter of a club is a most serious matter and one likely gravely to affect the position of the person as to whom that injurious suggestion was made . NARRATOR 3 From Reynolds newspaper : NARRATOR 2 The words written upon the card were of such character as to be unfit for publication . p. 6 EDWARD CLARKE But the matter does not stop at the question whether the card was delivered , or whether the defendant can in any way be excused by strong feeling  --  mistaken feeling  --  for having made that statement.By the plea which the defendant has brought before the court , a much graver issue has been raised . In his plea of justification , the defendant has said that the statement is true and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for those who have put into the plea these serious allegations to prove to you , gentlemen of the jury , if they can , by credible witnesses , that these allegations are true.Witnesses will be called who will prove the publication of the libel , and my learned friend has the task of satisfying you that there was enough justification for the publishing of that card . NARRATOR 1 John Sholto Douglas , Marquess of Queensberry , how do you plead ? MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY I plead not guilty , and also that the libel is true and that it is for the public benefit that it should be published . I wrote that card with the intention of bringing matters to a head , having been unable to meet Mr. Wilde otherwise , and to save my son , and I abide by what I wrote . ( Upheaval in the court .

NARRATOR 1 Mr. Oscar Wilde examined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am the prosecutor in this case . I am thirty-nine years of age . My father was Sir William Wilde , surgeon of Dublin , and chairman of the Census Commission . I was a student at Trinity College , where I took a classical scholarship and the gold medal for Greek . I then went to Magdalen College , Oxford , where I took a classical scholarship , a first in " Mods " and a first in " Greats . " There I also won the Newdigate Prize for English verse . I took my degree in 1878 , and came down at once . From that time I have devoted myself to art and literature . In 1881 , I published a volume of poems , and afterwards lectured in England and America . In 1884 , I married Miss Constance Lloyd , and from that date until now have lived with her in Tite Street , Chelsea . I have two sons , the elder of whom will be ten in June and the second nine in November . EDWARD CLARKE Mr. Wilde , you have published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray . OSCAR WILDE Yes . EDWARD CLARKE You have also toured America and Ireland lecturing on art , or more specifically , what you call the English Renaissance of Art . p. 8 NARRATOR 2 From a lecture to art students given in New York : OSCAR WILDE I call it the English Renaissance of Art because it is indeed a sort of new birth of the spirit of man . Like the great Italian Renaissance of the fifteenth century , it possesses a desire for a more comely way of life , a passion for physical beauty , an exclusive attention to form . It seeks new subjects for poetry , new forms of art , new intellectual and imaginative enjoyments . In art as in politics there is but one origin to all revolutions , a desire on the part of man for a nobler form of life , for a freer method and opportunity of expression . This renaissance will create a new brotherhood among men by furnishing a universal language . EDWARD CLARKE Mr. Wilde , you have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed in the West End ? OSCAR WILDE Yes , The Importance of Being Earnest and An Ideal Husband . EDWARD CLARKE When did you make the acquaintance of Lord Alfred Douglas ? OSCAR WILDE In 1891 . He was brought to my house by a friend . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS My first meeting with Oscar Wilde was an astonishment . NARRATOR 3 From The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas , written thirty years later : p. 9 LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS I had never heard a man talking with such perfect sentences before , as if he had written them all overnight with labor and yet all spontaneous . He did succeed in weaving spells . It all appeared to be Wisdom and Power and Beauty and Enchantment . One sat and listened to him enthralled . NARRATOR 4 From a letter written in January 1893 : OSCAR WILDE My own dear boy , Your sonnet is quite lovely , and it is a marvel that those red rose lips of yours should be no less for music of song than for madness of kisses . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible way . He was continually asking me to dine or lunch with him . He flattered me , gave me presents and made much of me in every way . He gave me copies of all his books , with inscriptions in them . OSCAR WILDE Your slim gilt soul walks between passion and poetry . I know Hyacinthus , whom Apollo loved so madly , was you in Greek days . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS I was from the first flattered that a man as distinguished as he was should pay me so much attention and attach so much importance to all my views and preferences and whims . OSCAR WILDE Why are you alone in London , and when do you go to Salisbury ? Do go there to cool your hands in the gray twilight of gothic things , then come here whenever you like . It is a lovely place  --  it only lacks you.Always with undying love , Yours , Oscar . p. 10 LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS I will say of him that even if he had never written a line of poetry , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDWARD CLARKE When did Lord Alfred 's father , the Marquess of Queensberry , first object to your relationship with his son ? OSCAR WILDE In April 1894 , I saw a letter that he wrote to his son . EDWARD CLARKE This is the letter in question . It was written on Sunday , 1st of April 1894 , at the Carter 's Hotel . It reads : MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY Alfred , Your intimacy with this man Wilde . It must either cease or I 'll disown you . I 'm not going to try and analyze your intimacy , and I make no charge ; but to my mind to pose as a thing is as bad as to be it . With my own eyes I saw you both in the most loathsome and disgusting relationship . Never in my experience have I seen such a sight as that in your horrible features . No wonder people are talking as they are . If I thought the actual thing was true , and it became public property , I should be quite justified in shooting him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Queensberry , Carter 's Hotel , Albemarle Street : NARRATOR 2 From a telegram written on the 2nd of April : p. 11 LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS What a funny little man you are . MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY If you send me any more such telegrams , or come with any impertinence , I will give you the thrashing you deserve . If I catch you again with that man I 'll make a public scandal that you little dream of . Unless this acquaintance ceases I shall carry out my threat and stop all supplies of money . So now you know what to expect . EDWARD CLARKE What did you do when you learned that the Marquess of Queensberry objected to your friendship with his son ? OSCAR WILDE I said I was perfectly ready to cease the acquaintance if it would make peace between him and his father ; but he preferred to do otherwise . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS I treat your absurd threats with absolute indifference . NARRATOR 2 From a letter written the next day : LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS I have made a point of appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to go to any of these places whenever I choose and with whom I choose . If Oscar Wilde was to prosecute you in the Criminal Courts for your outrageous libel you would get seven years ' penal servitude . MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY If I thought the actual thing was true , and it became public property , I should be quite justified in shooting him at sight . Right now I can only accuse him of posing . p. 12 LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS If you try to assault me I shall defend myself with a loaded revolver which I always carry ; and if I shoot you , or if he shoots you , we should be completely justified , as we should be acting in self-defense against a violent and dangerous rough . I think if you were dead not many people would miss you . MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY I received your telegram this morning by post from Carter 's and have requested them not to forward any more , but just to tear any up , as I did yours , without reading it . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EDWARD CLARKE What happened next ? OSCAR WILDE At the end of June 1894 , there was an interview between Lord Queensberry and myself in my house . He called upon me , not by appointment , at about four o'clock in the afternoon , accompanied by a gentleman with whom I was not acquainted . ( As WILDE narrates , QUEENSBERRY enters . ) The interview took place in my library . He said : MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY Sit down . OSCAR WILDE I said : I do not allow anyone to talk like that to me in my house or anywhere else . I suppose you have come to apologize to me for the statements you made about me in that letter you wrote to your son . I should have the right any day I chose to prosecute you for writing such a letter . p. 13 MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY The letter was privileged , as it was written to my son . OSCAR WILDE How dare you say such things to him about us ? MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY You were both kicked out of the Savoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . OSCAR WILDE That is a lie . MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY You have taken furnished rooms for him in Piccadilly . OSCAR WILDE Someone has been telling you an absurd set of lies . I have not done anything of the kind . MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY I hear you were thoroughly well blackmailed for a disgusting letter you wrote my son . OSCAR WILDE That letter was a beautiful letter , and I never write except for publication . I said : Lord Queensberry , do you seriously accuse us of improper conduct ? He replied : MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY I do not say that you are it , but you look it . ( Laughter in the court ) JUDGE I shall have the court cleared if I hear the slightest disturbance again . MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY You look it , and you pose as it , which is just as bad . If I catch you and my son together again in any public restaurant I will thrash you . p. 14 OSCAR WILDE I do not know what the Queensberry rules are , but the Oscar Wilde rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY I will not . OSCAR WILDE I will have you put out by the police . MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY It is a disgusting scandal . OSCAR WILDE If it be so , then you are the author of the scandal , and nobody else.I then went into the hall and pointed him out to my servant . This is the Marquess of Queensberry , the most infamous brute in London . You are never to allow him to enter my house again . SIR EDWARD CARSON So far as Lord Queensberry is concerned , any act he has done , in any letter he has written , he withdraws nothing . NARRATOR 1 Edward Carson , the attorney for the defense : SIR EDWARD CARSON He has done all those things with a premeditation and a determination at all risks and at all hazards to save his son . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS His so-called desire to save me is pure hypocrisy : NARRATOR 2 From The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas : LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS The real object is to persecute my mother and destroy me . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lecher. p. 15 NARRATOR 4 From a letter Queensberry wrote to his son : MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY If you are my son , it is only confirming proof to me how right I was to face every horror and misery I have done rather than run the risk of bringing more creatures into the world like yourself . That was the entire and only reason for my breaking with your mother as a wife , so intensely dissatisfied was I with her as a mother to you children . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS My mother divorced him ; he harassed her for years and by turns neglected and ill treated us . He 's despicable and mad . MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY No wonder you have fallen prey to this horrible brute . I am only sorry for you as a human creature . NARRATOR 3 George Bernard Shaw on the Marquess of Queensberry : GEORGE BERNARD SHAW His pretended solicitude for his son and his alleged desire to save him were nothing but a hypocritical pretense . He was a Scots Marquess , Earl , Viscount , and Baron , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after his divorce , a maniacal hatred for his family . His real objective was to ruin his son and to finally break the heart of his ex-wife . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS My entire family is with you Oscar . You must prosecute . p. 16 NARRATOR 3 From Clarke 's unpublished memoirs of the trial : EDWARD CLARKE Mr. Wilde , you 've told me you are considerably in debt . Who will carry the cost of these proceedings ? LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS My family will be delighted to pay for all the necessary costs . My father has been an incubus to us all . We have often discussed the possibility of getting him into a lunatic asylum . He is a daily source of annoyance to my mother and everyone else . My family will be only too delighted to pay for all costs and expenses to try my father . NARRATOR 1 From De Profundis : OSCAR WILDE Of course his family never paid for the costs of the trial . MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY You must all be mad , and if you make inquiries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reeking of this hideous scandal of Oscar Wilde for the past three years . EDWARD CLARKE When was your next encounter with the Marquess of Queensberry ? OSCAR WILDE It was at the St. James Theatre on the opening night of the play The Importance of Being Earnest.Lord Queensberry had booked a seat for the performance . NARRATOR 1 From a letter to Lord Alfred Douglas : p. 17 OSCAR WILDE Dearest Boy , Yes , the Scarlet Marquis made a plot to address the audience on the first night of my play ! Henry Bourke revealed it , and I had all Scotland Yard to guard the theater . When your father arrived there  --  with a prize fighter  --  the police did not allow him to enter . EDWARD CLARKE The disturbance on the opening night of a new play could be a very serious matter to author and actors , and it would have been especially serious if it had developed into a personal attack on the private character of Mr. Wilde . OSCAR WILDE He prowled about for three hours , then left chattering like some monstrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This of course makes his conduct idiotic , robs it of dignity . EDWARD CLARKE The Marquess had done this in another theater on the night of the performance of a play . Not one by Mr. Wilde , but one that dealt with religious issues . At a certain moment in the play , as a character talked about religion , the Marquess got up from his seat and began shouting at the actor on stage . I encourage you to imagine the consequences of such behavior on the opening night of a new play . EDWARD CLARKE What happened next ? OSCAR WILDE On the 28th of February I went to the Albemarle Club and received from the porter the card which has been produced . p. 18 NARRATOR 1 The court calls Sidney Wright . SIDNEY WRIGHT I am the hall porter at the Albemarle Club . Mr. and Mrs. Wilde are members of the club . On the 18th of February the Marquess of Queensberry came to the club and said : MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY I 'm here to see Oscar Wilde . SIDNEY WRIGHT When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note on a card and said : MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY Give that to Mr. Wilde . SIDNEY WRIGHT ( He reads the card . ) : When Mr. Wilde came to the club on the 28th of February , I handed it to him . ( He does . ) He read it and appeared very distraught by its content . MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY Oscar Wilde , posing somdomite . OSCAR WILDE ( showing the card to WRIGHT ) : The Marquess 's spelling is somewhat unusual . NARRATOR 1 From a letter to his friend Robert Ross , written that night : OSCAR WILDE Dearest Robie:Something has happened . Bosie 's father has left a card at my club with hideous words on it . I can see nothing but a criminal prosecution . My whole life seems ruined by this man . I do n't know what to do . p. 19 NARRATOR 4 From Oscar Wilde by Frank Harris . An account of their meeting at the Caf Royal : FRANK HARRIS Oscar , Bernard Shaw is lunching with me tomorrow at the Caf Royal . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Bernard Shaw : GEORGE BERNARD SHAW Wilde came in and told us the story of the conflict.He finished by saying that he was taking the Marquess of Queensberry to court . OSCAR WILDE I 'm bringing an action against Queensberry , Frank , for criminal libel . He is a mere wild beast . FRANK HARRIS Oscar , you must not do anything of the kind . OSCAR WILDE My solicitors tell me that some of the things I have written will be brought up against me in court . Now , you know all I have written . Would you in your position as editor of The Fortnightly come and give evidence for me , testify that Dorian Gray is not an immoral book ? FRANK HARRIS Yes . I am perfectly willing , and I can say more than that ; I can say that you are one of the very few men I have ever known whose talk and whose writing were vowed away from grossness of any sort . OSCAR WILDE Oh , Frank , would you ? p. 20 GEORGE BERNARD SHAW He was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . Your evidence will win the case . FRANK HARRIS Anything I can do , Oscar , I shall do with pleasure . But I want you to consider the matter carefully . An English law court is all very well for two average men who are fighting an ordinary business dispute . That is what it is made for , but to judge the morality or immorality of an artist is to ask the court to do what it is wholly unfit to do . OSCAR WILDE My solicitors tell me I shall win . FRANK HARRIS Solicitors live on quarrels . Let us begin by putting the law courts out of the question . Do n't forget that if you lose and Queensberry goes free , everyone will hold that you have been guilty of nameless vice . The Crown could charge you with gross indecency and send you to two years hard labor . You must know that that could happen . You could go to prison for two years . OSCAR WILDE But Frank FRANK HARRIS You must remember that you are a standard-bearer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you lose you will make it harder for all writers in England . God knows it 's hard enough already , but you will put back the hands of the clock by fifty years . p. 21 OSCAR WILDE What should I do ? FRANK HARRIS You should go abroad , and as ace of trumps , you should take your wife with you . OSCAR WILDE You are right of course , Frank . You know it 's Bosie who wants me to fight his father . FRANK HARRIS Let Queensberry and his son fight out their own miserable quarrels ; they are well matched . OSCAR WILDE Oh , Frank , how can I do that ? GEORGE BERNARD SHAW I think it was about this time that Bosie Douglas came in . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS The day of the lunch at the Caf Royal I was very anxious that the case against my father would proceed and I resented any arguments in favor of its abandonment . I was terribly afraid that Oscar would weaken and throw up the sponge . GEORGE BERNARD SHAW At Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas got up at once and said : LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS Such advice shows you are no friend of Oscar 's . FRANK HARRIS What do you mean ? GEORGE BERNARD SHAW He turned and left the room on the spot . Then , Oscar got up and said : p. 22 OSCAR WILDE It is not friendly of you , Frank . It really is not friendly . GEORGE BERNARD SHAW And he too left the room . FRANK HARRIS I turned to Shaw and said : Did I say anything in the heat of the argument that would have offended Oscar or Douglas ? GEORGE BERNARD SHAW Nothing , not a word ; you have nothing to reproach yourself with . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS I stormed out of the restaurant because I feared I might not be able to convince you and Mr. Shaw and that you would argue Wilde out of the state of mind I had gotten him into . MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY You reptile ! FRANK HARRIS Once Douglas left I was suddenly struck by a sort of likeness , a similarity of expression and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not get it out of my head : that little face blanched with rage and the wild , hating eyes , the shrill voice , too , was Queensberry 's . MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY You are no son of mine and I never thought you were . FRANK HARRIS One thing was clear from our meeting . Lord Alfred had set his mind on Wilde prosecuting his father . It seemed as if he knew exactly how that was to be done . p. 23 LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS Sir Edward , you must put me in the witness box and allow me to testify against my father . NARRATOR 1 From The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas : LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS If not , we might as well throw up the case at once . He said : EDWARD CLARKE Make your mind at rest , Lord Alfred , I agree with everything you say . My idea of the way to conduct this case is to launch out at the very outset with a deadly attack on Lord Queensberry for his conduct to his family , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS I said : Yes , but you must promise faithfully you will put me in the box.He replied : EDWARD CLARKE I promise you I will ; you shall go into the box immediately after my opening speech . NARRATOR 2 From the unpublished memoirs of the trial by Sir Edward Clarke : EDWARD CLARKE I made no such agreement or promise . NARRATOR 2 A warrant for the arrest of Lord Sholto Douglas , the 8th Marquess of Queensberry , was issued the next day . ( Three strikes of the gavel ) EDWARD CLARKE In his plea of justification , submitted by the Marquess of Queensberry , he has said that the statement made in his card is true , and that it was made for the public benefit.In support of this plea he puts forth , amongst other things , the following proof : first , that Mr. Wilde published or caused to have published a magazine entitled The Chameleon , relating to the practices of persons of unnatural habit.And second , that Mr. Wilde published or caused to have published a certain immoral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Marquess alleges that this book describes the relations , intimacies , and passions of certain persons guilty of unnatural practices.Gentlemen of the jury , it would appear , according to this plea of justification , that what is on trial here is not the Marquess of Queensberry but Mr. Wilde 's art.Mr . Wilde , it is suggested that you are responsible for the publication of the magazine The Chameleon , on the front page of which some aphorisms of yours appear . Beyond sending that contribution , had you anything to do with the preparation or publication of the magazine ? p. 24 OSCAR WILDE No . Nothing whatever . EDWARD CLARKE The other question relates to the book The Picture of Dorian Gray . These are some of the reviews of Dorian Gray : The Speaker : NARRATOR 2 A work of serious art . EDWARD CLARKE The Glasgow Herald : NARRATOR 1 The book is a delight to the hand and the eye . EDWARD CLARKE The Echo : NARRATOR 4 The end suffered by Dorian Gray , his disintegration into a heap of muck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . Mr. Wilde has written the most moral book of this century . EDWARD CLARKE Mr. Wilde , would you care to add anything ? OSCAR WILDE No . EDWARD CLARKE In the next part of the plea of justification submitted by the Marquess of Queensberry , he names several young men and impugns your character with them . You have read the plea ? OSCAR WILDE Yes . EDWARD CLARKE Is there any truth in any of these accusations ? OSCAR WILDE There is no truth whatever in any one of them . p. 25 EDWARD CLARKE My lord , nothing more with this witness . ( Three strikes of the gavel ) NARRATOR 1 Oscar Wilde cross-examined by Edward Carson : SIR EDWARD CARSON Lord Queensberry 's conduct has been absolutely consistent all through , and if the facts which he stated in his letters as to Mr. Wilde 's reputation and acts are correct , then not only was he justified in doing what he could to cut short what would probably prove to be a most disastrous acquaintance for his son , but in taking every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry into the acts and doings of Mr. Wilde . You stated that your age was thirty-nine . I think you are over forty . OSCAR WILDE I have no wish to pose as being young . I am thirty-nine or forty . You have my certificate and that should settle the matter . SIR EDWARD CARSON You were born on the 16th of October 1854 . That makes you more than forty . OSCAR WILDE Ah ! Very well . SIR EDWARD CARSON What age is Lord Alfred Douglas ? OSCAR WILDE Lord Alfred Douglas is about twenty-four , and was between twenty and twenty-one years of age when I first knew him . p. 26 SIR EDWARD CARSON I hold in my hand a letter written by Mr. Wilde to Lord Alfred Douglas ; I will now read it for the court.My own dear Boy , Your sonnet is quite lovely , and it is a marvel that those red rose lips of yours should have been made no less for music of song than for madness of kisses .

Do go there to cool your hands in the gray twilight of gothic things , then came here whenever you like .

OSCAR WILDE I was fond of him . I have always been fond of him . Sir , this is a beautiful letter . It is a poem . I was not writing an ordinary letter . You might as well cross-examine me as to whether King Lear or a sonnet of Shakespeare 's is proper . SIR EDWARD CARSON Apart from art , Mr. Wilde ? OSCAR WILDE I can not answer apart from art . SIR EDWARD CARSON Suppose a man who was not an artist had written this letter , would you say it was a proper letter ? OSCAR WILDE A man who was not an artist could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARSON Why ? OSCAR WILDE Because nobody but an artist could write it . He certainly could not write the language unless he were a man of letters . SIR EDWARD CARSON I can suggest , for the sake of your reputation , that there is nothing very wonderful in this " red rose lips of yours " ? OSCAR WILDE A great deal depends on the way it is read . SIR EDWARD CARSON " Your slim gilt soul walks between passion and poetry . " Is that a beautiful phrase ? OSCAR WILDE Not as you read it , Mr. Carson . You read it very badly . SIR EDWARD CARSON I do not profess to be an artist ; and when I hear you give evidence , I am glad I am not . EDWARD CLARKE I object , my lord . I do n't think my friend should talk like that . JUDGE Sustained . Mr. Carson , please . EDWARD CLARKE ( to WILDE ) : Pray , do not criticize my friend 's reading again . SIR EDWARD CARSON Here is another letter which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read it ? OSCAR WILDE No , I decline . I do n't see why I should . p. 28 SIR EDWARD CARSON Then I will . NARRATOR 1 From a letter written at the Savoy Hotel : SIR EDWARD CARSON Dearest of all boys , Your letter was delightful , red and yellow wine to me ; but I am sad and out of sorts . Bosie , you must not make scenes with me . They kill me , they wreck the loveliness of life . I can not see you , so Greek and gracious , distorted with passion . I can not listen to your curved lips saying hideous things to me . I would sooner die than have you bitter , unjust , hating . I must see you soon . You are the divine thing I want , the thing of grace and beauty , but I do n't know how to do it . I have also got a new sitting-room . Why are you not here , my dear , my wonderful boy ? Your own Oscar.Is that an ordinary letter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pose as being ordinary , great heavens ! Ask me any question you like about it . SIR EDWARD CARSON Is it the kind of letter that a man writes to another ? OSCAR WILDE It was a tender expression of my great admiration for Lord Alfred Douglas . SIR EDWARD CARSON ( holding a magazine in his hand ) : Mr. Wilde , this is the magazine The Chameleon ? p. 29 OSCAR WILDE Yes . SIR EDWARD CARSON Why did you contribute your writings to The Chameleon ? OSCAR WILDE I was asked by a friend to do so . SIR EDWARD CARSON Would that friend be Lord Alfred Douglas ? OSCAR WILDE Yes . SIR EDWARD CARSON Why would he want you to contribute to this magazine ? OSCAR WILDE The publishers of the magazine are friends of him at Oxford . The Chameleon is an Oxford undergraduate publication . SIR EDWARD CARSON Lord Alfred Douglas himself also contributed to this issue of the magazine . Two poems , I believe . OSCAR WILDE Yes . Two very beautiful poems . SIR EDWARD CARSON In the magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Lord Alfred Douglas , there is a short story entitled ( reading ) " The Priest and the Acolyte . " In it a priest falls in love with a boy who serves him at the altar , and is discovered by the rector in the priest 's room . Then scandal arises . Have you read " The Priest and the Acolyte " ? OSCAR WILDE Yes . SIR EDWARD CARSON You have no doubt whatever that that was an improper story ? p. 30 OSCAR WILDE From a literary point of view it was highly improper . It would be impossible for a man of literature to judge it otherwise ; by literature I mean treatment , selection of subject , and the like . I thought the treatment rotten and the subject rotten . SIR EDWARD CARSON You are of the opinion , I believe , that there is no such thing as an immoral book ? OSCAR WILDE That is correct . SIR EDWARD CARSON May I take it you think " The Priest and the Acolyte " was not immoral ? OSCAR WILDE It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you think the story blasphemous ? OSCAR WILDE The story filled me with disgust . The end was wrong . SIR EDWARD CARSON Answer the question , sir . Did you or did you not consider the story blasphemous ? OSCAR WILDE I thought it horrible . " Blasphemous " is not a word of mine.In writing a play or a book , I am concerned entirely with literature , that is , with art . I aim not at doing good or evil , but at making a thing that will have some quality of beauty . SIR EDWARD CARSON This is your contribution to The Chameleon . " Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young . " This is one of those phrases : " Wickedness is a myth invented by good people to account for the curious attractiveness of others . " You think that true ? p. 31 OSCAR WILDE I rarely think that anything I write is true . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you say " rarely " ? OSCAR WILDE I said " rarely . " I might have said " never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . SIR EDWARD CARSON " If one tells the truth , one is sure , sooner or later , to be found out . " OSCAR WILDE That is a pleasing paradox , but I do not set very high store on it as an axiom . SIR EDWARD CARSON Is it good for the young ? OSCAR WILDE Anything is good that stimulates thought in any age . SIR EDWARD CARSON Whether moral or immoral ? OSCAR WILDE There is no such thing as morality or immorality in thought . SIR EDWARD CARSON " Pleasure is the only thing one should live for . " OSCAR WILDE I think that the realization of oneself is the prime aim in life , and to realize oneself through pleasure is surely finer than to do so through pain . I am , on that point , entirely on the side of the ancients  --  the Greeks . It is a pagan idea . SIR EDWARD CARSON " A truth ceases to be true when more than one person believes in it . " p. 32 OSCAR WILDE Perfectly . That would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the same truth could never be appreciated by two minds . SIR EDWARD CARSON What would you say would be the effect of " Phrases and Philosophies " taken in connection with such an article as " The Priest and the Acolyte " ? OSCAR WILDE Undoubtedly , it was the idea that might be formed that made me object so strongly to the story . I saw at once that maxims that were perfectly nonsensical , paradoxical , or whatever you like , might be read in conjunction with it . SIR EDWARD CARSON I will now move to The Picture of Dorian Gray . These are some other reviews of Dorian Gray . The Scottish Leader : NARRATOR 3 The novel portrays the gilded paganism which has been staining these later years of Victorian epoch with horrors that carry us back to the worst incidents in the history of ancient Rome . SIR EDWARD CARSON The St. Fames Gazette : NARRATOR 4 The Picture of Dorian Gray is a stupid and vulgar piece of work . Not wishing to offend the nostrils of decent persons , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is dangerous and corrupt . p. 33 NARRATOR 1 From The Soul of Man Under Socialism : OSCAR WILDE In the old days , men had the rack . Now they have the press . SIR EDWARD CARSON This is from your introduction to Dorian Gray : " There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book . Books are well written or badly written . " That expresses your view ? OSCAR WILDE My view on art , yes . SIR EDWARD CARSON Then may I take it that no matter how immoral a book may be , if it is well written , it is , in your opinion , a good book ? OSCAR WILDE Yes , if it were well written so as to produce a sense of beauty , which is the highest sense of which a human being can be capable . If it were badly written , it would produce a sense of disgust . SIR EDWARD CARSON A perverted novel might be a good book ? OSCAR WILDE I do n't know what you mean by a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest Dorian Gray as open to the inter-pretation of being such a novel ? OSCAR WILDE That could only be to brutes and illiterates . The views of Philistines are entirely unaccountable . SIR EDWARD CARSON The St. James Gazette : p. 34 NARRATOR 4 Mr. Wilde says that his story is a moral tale , because the wicked persons in it come to a bad end . OSCAR WILDE I never said my characters were wicked . NARRATOR 4 In this newspaper 's opinion , the work is unredeemed because it constantly hints , not obscurely , at disgusting sins and abominable crimes . OSCAR WILDE The books that the world calls immoral are the books that show the world its own shame . SIR EDWARD CARSON I will now proceed to read from Dorian Gray . This is from the segment when the painter Basil Hallward meets Dorian Gray ( reading ) : The story is simply this . Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon 's . Well , after I had been in the room about ten minutes , talking to huge overdressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone was looking at me . ( These last four words are spoken by both WILDE and CARSON as WILDE takes over narrating the story . ) OSCAR WILDE I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time . When our eyes met , I felt that I was growing pale . A curious instinct of terror came over me . I knew that I had come face to face with someone whose mere personality was so fascinating that , if I allowed it to do so , it would absorb my whole nature , my whole soul , my very art itself . I grew afraid , and turned to quit the room . It was not courage that made me do so : it was cowardice . I take no credit to myself for trying to escape.I struggled towards the door . There , of course , I stumbled against Lady Brandon . " You are not going to turn away so soon , Mr. Hallward ? " she screamed out . You know her shrill horrid voice ? She is a peacock in everything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up to the royalties , and people with Stars and Garters , and elderly ladies with tiaras and hooked noses.Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely stirred me. p. 35 SIR EDWARD CARSON ( taking over the narration ) : We were quite close , almost touching . Our eyes met again . It was reckless of me , but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.The Pall Mall Gazette : NARRATOR 3 The Picture of Dorian Gray ought to be chucked into the fire . OSCAR WILDE To say that such a book as mine ought to be chucked into the fire is silly . That 's what one does with newspapers . SIR EDWARD CARSON Here 's another section : I see Dorian every day now . I could n't be happy if I did n't see him every day . Of course , sometimes it is only for a few minutes , but a few minutes with somebody one worships is worth a great deal . OSCAR WILDE ( taking over the narration ) : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more romance of feeling than a man usually gives to a friend . From the moment we met , your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me . I quite admit that I adored you madly , extravagantly , absurdly . I was jealous of everyone to whom you spoke . I wanted to have you all to myself . I was only happy when I was with you . When I was away from you , you were still present in my art.One day I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you . It was to have been my masterpiece . It is my masterpiece . But , as I worked it , each flake and film of color seemed to me to reveal my secret . p. 36 SIR EDWARD CARSON ( taking over the narration ) : I grew afraid that the world would know of my idolatry . I felt , Dorian , that I had told too much . Then , it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited . The picture must not be shown.Do you mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man towards another ? OSCAR WILDE It would be the influence produced by a beautiful personality . SIR EDWARD CARSON A beautiful person ? OSCAR WILDE I said " a beautiful personality . " You can describe it as you like . Dorian Gray 's was a most remarkable personality . SIR EDWARD CARSON May I take it that you , as an artist , have never known the feeling you described here ? OSCAR WILDE I have never allowed any personality to dominate my art . SIR EDWARD CARSON Then you have never known the feeling you described ? OSCAR WILDE No . It is a work of fiction . SIR EDWARD CARSON But let us go over it phrase by phrase . " I quite admit that I adored you madly . " What do you have to say to that ? Have you ever adored a young man madly ? OSCAR WILDE No , not madly . I prefer love  --  that is a higher form . p. 37 SIR EDWARD CARSON Never mind about that . Let us keep down to the level we are at now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except myself . SIR EDWARD CARSON Then you have never had that feeling ? OSCAR WILDE No . The whole idea was borrowed from Shakespeare , I regret to say  --  yes , from Shakespeare 's sonnets . SIR EDWARD CARSON " I grew jealous of everyone to whom you spoke . " Have you ever been jealous of a young man ? OSCAR WILDE Never in my life . SIR EDWARD CARSON " I wanted to have you all to myself . " Have you ever had that feeling ? OSCAR WILDE No . I should consider it a nuisance , an intense bore . SIR EDWARD CARSON " I grew afraid that the world would know of my idolatry . " Why should he grow afraid that the world should know of it ? OSCAR WILDE Because there are people in the world who can not understand the intense devotion , affection , and admiration that an artist can feel for a wonderful and beautiful personality . These are the conditions under which we live . I regret them . SIR EDWARD CARSON These unfortunate people , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down to something wrong ? p. 38 OSCAR WILDE Undoubtedly . ( Three strikes of the gavel ) NARRATOR 3 Thursday , 4th of April 1895 . The second day of the trial.From The Evening News : NARRATOR 1 Today is the second day of the hearing of the prosecution of the Marquess of Queensberry for criminal libel by Oscar Wilde.The fame of yesterday 's performance , for it was little else , has gone abroad . Newspapers around the world have front page stories on the trial . In Paris , Le Temps : NARRATOR 4 This is how the English behave with their poets . NARRATOR 1 The New York Herald : NARRATOR 2 This is how English poets behave . NARRATOR 1 Today the cross-examination intends to leave the literary plane and penetrate the dim-lit , perfumed rooms where the poet of the beautiful joined with valets and grooms in the bond of silver cigarette cases . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS My father used the period right before the trial to hire two detectives to round up men who had been with Oscar . NARRATOR 3 From The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were warned that unless they testified against Oscar , they themselves would be taken to court . p. 39 NARRATOR 2 The court is in session . ( Three strikes of the gavel ) SIR EDWARD CARSON Lord Queensberry learned that Wilde had been going about with young men who were not co-equal with him in social position or in age . These men , it will be proved beyond doubt , are some of the most immoral characters in London.I refer above all to the man Alfred Taylor , a most notorious character  --  as the police will tell the court  --  who occupied rooms which were nothing more or less than a shameful den . Mr. Wilde , do you know Alfred Taylor ? OSCAR WILDE Yes . SIR EDWARD CARSON Is he an intimate friend of yours ? OSCAR WILDE I do not call him an intimate friend . He was a friend of mine . I have been several times to his house , some seven or eight times , perhaps . SIR EDWARD CARSON You used to go to tea parties there , afternoon tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rooms strike you as being peculiar ? OSCAR WILDE No , except that he displayed more than usual taste . SIR EDWARD CARSON Not the sort of street you would usually visit . You had no other friends there ? p. 40 OSCAR WILDE No , this was merely a bachelor 's place . SIR EDWARD CARSON Rather a rough neighborhood . OSCAR WILDE That I do n't know . I know it was near the Houses of Parliament . SIR EDWARD CARSON Taylor burned incense , did he not ? OSCAR WILDE Pastilles , I think . SIR EDWARD CARSON Incense , I suggest . OSCAR WILDE I think not , pastilles , I should say . In those little Japanese things that run along rods . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you know that Taylor had a lady 's costume  --  a lady 's fancy dress  --  in his rooms ? OSCAR WILDE No . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you ever see him with one on ? OSCAR WILDE No . I was never told he had such dresses . He is a man of great taste and intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good English school . SIR EDWARD CARSON Now , did you know that Taylor was being watched by the police ? OSCAR WILDE No , I never heard that . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you know that Taylor was notorious for introducing young men to older men ? p. 41 OSCAR WILDE I never heard that in my life . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you get him to arrange dinners at which you could meet young me OSCAR WILDE No . SIR EDWARD CARSON But you have dined with young men ? OSCAR WILDE Often . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you meet Charles Parker at his house ? OSCAR WILDE Yes . I met him at tea there . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you ever meet a man named Sidney Mavor there ? OSCAR WILDE Yes . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you meet Fred Atkins there ? OSCAR WILDE Yes . SIR EDWARD CARSON How many men has Alfred Taylor introduced you to ? OSCAR WILDE About five . SIR EDWARD CARSON Were these young men all about twenty ? OSCAR WILDE Yes ; twenty or twenty-two . SIR EDWARD CARSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if these particular young men had occupations . p. 42 SIR EDWARD CARSON Have you given money to them ? OSCAR WILDE Yes . I think to all five  --  money or presents . SIR EDWARD CARSON What was there in common between these young men and yourself ? What attraction had they for you ? OSCAR WILDE I delight in the society of people much younger than myself . I like those who may be called idle or careless . I recognize no social distinctions at all of any kind ; and to me youth , the mere fact of youth , is so wonderful that I would sooner talk to a young man for half-an-hour than be  --  well , cross-examined in court . NARRATOR 2 From Lord Alfred Douglas by H. Montgomery Hyde:In the first interview between Sir Edward Clarke and Oscar Wilde , Clarke said : EDWARD CLARKE Mr. Wilde , I can only accept this brief , if you assure me on your honor that there is not and never has been any foundation for the charges that are made against you . OSCAR WILDE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me your word as an English gentleman . OSCAR WILDE I do . NARRATOR 2 The thing that Clarke overlooked is that Wilde was an Irishman . p. 43 NARRATOR 3 This promise was made in the presence of Lord Alfred Douglas , who never thought to deny it or to alert Oscar to the danger he faced if the lie was disproved in court . NARRATOR 4 Lord Alfred Douglas was asked years later if Wilde often denied his homosexuality . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS Oscar was never in the least degree ashamed of his homosexuality . Of course we did n't have that word back then . But he talked openly about his desire for men . He gloried in it . He never denied it except , as George Bernard Shaw points out , " when legal fictions were necessary in the courts of law . " SIR EDWARD CARSON Among these five did Taylor introduce you to Charles Parker ? OSCAR WILDE Yes , he was one with whom I became friendly . SIR EDWARD CARSON How old was Mr. Parker ? OSCAR WILDE He was twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? OSCAR WILDE At Kettner 's . It was Taylor 's birthday , and I asked him to dinner , telling him to bring any of his friends . He brought the two Parkers . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you know that Charles Parker was a gentleman 's valet , and the other a groom ? p. 44 OSCAR WILDE I did not know it , but if I had I should not have cared . I did n't care two pence what they were . I liked them . SIR EDWARD CARSON Taylor accepted your invitation by inviting a valet and a groom to dine with you ? OSCAR WILDE That would be your account , not mine . SIR EDWARD CARSON What did you have for dinner ? OSCAR WILDE Well , I really ca n't recall the menu . SIR EDWARD CARSON Was it a good dinner ? OSCAR WILDE Yes , certainly . SIR EDWARD CARSON All for the valet and the groom ? OSCAR WILDE No , for my friends and for Mr. Taylor , whose birthday it was . SIR EDWARD CARSON You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILDE I entertained Mr. Taylor and his two guests . SIR EDWARD CARSON In a private room , of course . OSCAR WILDE Yes , certainly . SIR EDWARD CARSON You had wine ? OSCAR WILDE Of course . SIR EDWARD CARSON Was there plenty of champagne ? p. 45 OSCAR WILDE Well , I did not press wine upon them . SIR EDWARD CARSON You did not stint them ? OSCAR WILDE What gentleman would stint his guests ? SIR EDWARD CARSON What gentleman would stint the valet and the groom ? EDWARD CLARKE I object , my lord SIR EDWARD CARSON I withdraw the question . Do you drink champagne yourself ? OSCAR WILDE Yes , iced champagne is a favorite drink of mine  --  strongly against my doctor 's orders . SIR EDWARD CARSON Never mind your doctor 's orders , sir . OSCAR WILDE I never do . SIR EDWARD CARSON After dinner , did you drive Charles Parker to the Savoy Hotel ? OSCAR WILDE No , he never went with me to the Savoy at all . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did any improprieties take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none whatsoever . SIR EDWARD CARSON When did you first meet Fred Atkins ? OSCAR WILDE In October 1892. p. 46 SIR EDWARD CARSON How old was he ? OSCAR WILDE He was about nineteen or twenty . SIR EDWARD CARSON You dined with him ? OSCAR WILDE Yes . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you give Atkins a cigarette case ? OSCAR WILDE Yes . I found him a pleasant , good-humored companion . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you give Atkins any money ? OSCAR WILDE Yes , 3 15s. to buy his first song for the music-hall stage . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did improprieties ever take place between you and Atkins ? OSCAR WILDE No , none whatsoever . SIR EDWARD CARSON You knew a man named Ernest Scarfe ? OSCAR WILDE Yes . SIR EDWARD CARSON How old is he ? OSCAR WILDE He is a young man of about twenty . SIR EDWARD CARSON You had dinner with him ? OSCAR WILDE Yes . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you give Scarfe any money ? OSCAR WILDE Never . p. 47 SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you give him any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIR EDWARD CARSON When did you first know Sidney Mavor ? OSCAR WILDE In September 1892 . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you give Mavor any money ? OSCAR WILDE No . I gave him a cigarette case . SIR EDWARD CARSON Do you know Walter Grainger ? OSCAR WILDE Yes . SIR EDWARD CARSON How old is he ? OSCAR WILDE He was about sixteen when I knew him . SIR EDWARD CARSON What was his occupation ? OSCAR WILDE He was a servant at a certain house in Height Street . SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you ever kiss him ? OSCAR WILDE Oh , dear no . He was a peculiarly plain boy . He was , unfortunately , extremely ugly . I pitied him for it . ( The court falls silent . Pause . ) SIR EDWARD CARSON Was that the reason why you did not kiss him ? OSCAR WILDE Oh , Mr. Carson , you are impertinently insolent. p. 48 SIR EDWARD CARSON Did you say that in support of your statement that you never kissed him ? OSCAR WILDE No . It is a childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward as a reason why you never kissed the boy ? OSCAR WILDE No , not at all . SIR EDWARD CARSON Why , sir , did you mention that this boy was extremely ugly ? OSCAR WILDE For this reason . If I were asked why I did not kiss a doormat , I should say because I do not like to kiss doormats . I do not know why I mentioned that he was ugly , except that I was stung by the insolent question you had put to me and the way you have insulted me throughout this hearing . SIR EDWARD CARSON Why did you mention his ugliness ? OSCAR WILDE It is ridiculous to imagine that any such thing could have occurred under any circumstances . SIR EDWARD CARSON Then why did you mention his ugliness , I ask you ? OSCAR WILDE Perhaps I was insulted by an insulting question . SIR EDWARD CARSON Is that a reason why you should say the boy was ugly ? OSCAR WILDE No , I said it because ( WILDE ca n't find the words to continue. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't ( WILDE ca n't find the words to continue . ) SIR EDWARD CARSON Why ? OSCAR WILDE Because SIR EDWARD CARSON Why did you say that ? OSCAR WILDE You sting me and insult me and try to unnerve me ; and at times one says things flippantly when one ought to speak more seriously . I admit that . SIR EDWARD CARSON Then you said it flippantly ? OSCAR WILDE Oh , yes , it was a flippant answer . SIR EDWARD CARSON I 'm done with this witness , my lord . OSCAR WILDE No indecencies ever took place between myself and Grainger . I went down SIR EDWARD CARSON I 'm finished with this witness , my lord ! EDWARD CLARKE My lord , this is the case for the prosecution . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS I ca n't believe this ! NARRATOR 1 From Oscar Wilde : A Summing Up by Lord Alfred Douglas : LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS If Sir Edward Clarke had not gone back on his solemn promise to put me in the witness box so that I could testify against my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have helped . NARRATOR 2 From Clarke 's unpublished memoirs of the trials : EDWARD CLARKE Lord Queensberry 's character was not on trial here , and it was quite irrelevant to the case . The legal argument was concerned purely and simply with whether or not the Marquess could justify his libel in a court of law . NARRATOR 4 From Oscar Wilde by Sheridan Morley : EDWARD CLARKE Wilde and I decided that Alfred Douglas should not be called as a witness . It would look quite bad to have Queensberry attacked by his own child . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS If I had got into the witness box I probably would have saved Oscar , because in the first place , I was a first-class witness , and in the second place , it would have been impossible for Carson to cross-examine me in a hostile way without exposing the hypocrisy of my father and establishing the truth . NARRATOR 4 For the rest of his life Lord Alfred Douglas would regret not having been called to the witness box . EDWARD CLARKE The case for the prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power to call evidence to rebut anything that may be sprung on me . ( Three strikes of the gavel ) p. 51 NARRATOR 1 Edward Carson , The opening speech for the defense : ( Three strikes of the gavel ) SIR EDWARD CARSON Gentlemen , from beginning to end Lord Queensberry , in dealing with Mr. Oscar Wilde , has been influenced by one hope alone : that of saving his son.In my judgment , even if the case had rested on Mr. Wilde 's art and literature alone , Lord Queensberry would have been absolutely justified in the course he has taken . Lord Queensberry has undertaken to prove that Mr. Wilde has been " posing " as guilty of certain vices.I am not here to say anything has ever happened between Lord Alfred Douglas and Mr. Oscar Wilde . God forbid ! But everything shows that the young man was in a dangerous position in that he acquiesced to the domination of Mr. Wilde , a man of great ability and attainments . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS That 's absurd . NARRATOR 3 From Oscar Wilde , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALFRED DOUGLAS After I had known Oscar for about nine months , I did with him and allowed him to do with me just what was done among boys at Winchester and Oxford . He treated me as an older boy treats a younger one at school . He also taught me things that were new to me . SIR EDWARD CARSON Against this Lord Queensberry protested ; and I wish to know , gentlemen , are you , for that protest , going to send Lord Queensberry to jail ? I will now proceed with the most painful part of the case . I will introduce you to a series of young men who will testify under oath that Mr. Oscar Wilde solicited their services in committing acts of the grossest indecency.You will hear from Charles Parker . He will tell you that Mr. Wilde committed acts of gross indecency with him . You will hear from Alfred Wood . He too will tell you that Mr. Wilde paid him to commit these acts with him.You will hear from William Parker , you will hear from Sidney Mavor , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men testify that Mr. Wilde committed acts of the grossest indecency with them . You will hear from their lips ( CARSON continues with his text , sotto voce. ) p. 52 NARRATOR 2 At this point Clarke was seen to leave the court with Wilde.From Lord Alfred Douglas by H. Montgomery Hyde : EDWARD CLARKE Mr. Wilde , it is almost impossible in view of all the circumstances to induce a jury to convict of a criminal offense a father who was endeavoring to save his son from an evil companionship . I see no hope at all of a guilty verdict . Moreover , if these men testify , the Crown could use their testimony to start a legal action against you for gross indecency.If we want to avoid this , we must drop your charges against the Marquess at once.I advise you in your own interest to allow me to make a statement to this effect in court and withdraw from the prosecution . If these men are called , I see your arrest as inevitable . OSCAR WILDE I agree with your advice . EDWARD CLARKE If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you time to get to Calais . There is no necessity for your presence in court while the announcement is being made . OSCAR WILDE No . I shall stay . NARRATOR 1 Clarke subsequently wrote in his unpublished memoirs of the trial : EDWARD CLARKE I hoped and expected that he would take the opportunity of escaping from the country , and I believe he would have had no difficulty in doing so . The authorities were quite willing that he should go abroad . p. 53 NARRATOR 2 Wilde chose to remain in court while Clarke made his statement . OSCAR WILDE I shall stay . SIR EDWARD CARSON The wonder is not that the gossip reached Lord Queensberry , but that , after it was known , this man Wilde should have been tolerated in society in London for the length of time he has . NARRATOR 3 At this point Sir Edward Clarke was seen to pluck Mr. Carson by the gown . He then interposed and asked leave of the judge to consult with his learned friend . After a few moments of whispered conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May I claim your lordship 's indulgence while I interpose to make a statement ? JUDGE Yes you may , Sir Edward . EDWARD CLARKE I think it must be present to your lordship 's mind that those who represent Mr. Wilde in this case have before us a very terrible anxiety.We can not conceal from ourselves that the evidence that has been submitted might induce the jury to say that Lord Queensberry in using the word " posing " was using a word for which there was sufficient justification.Under these circumstances , I hope your lordship will think I am taking the right course , which I take after communicating with Mr. Wilde . I feel we could not resist a verdict of not guilty in this case  --  not guilty having reference to the word " posing . " With this in mind , I now interpose and say on behalf of Mr. Wilde that I would ask to withdraw from the prosecution . ( Audience gasps . ) I trust that this may make an end of the case . p. 54 SIR EDWARD CARSON I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this application my learned friend has made . I can only say , as far as Lord Queensberry is concerned , that if there is a plea of not guilty , this plea must include that his plea of justification has been proved . JUDGE Sir Edward ? ( CLARKE looks at WILDE , who does n't answer . He then turns to the JUDGE and assents . ) JUDGE I understand him to assent to a verdict of not guilty , and of course the jury will return that . SIR EDWARD CARSON The verdict will be that the plea of justification has been proved , and that the words were published for the public benefit . EDWARD CLARKE Yes , Mr. Carson . ( Three strikes of the gavel ) THE CLERK OF ARRAIGNS Gentlemen of the jury , do you find the plea of justification has been proved ? THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY Yes , we do . THE CLERK OF ARRAIGNS And do you find the defendant not guilty ? THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY Yes . THE CLERK OF ARRAIGNS And that is the verdict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JURY Yes . THE CLERK OF ARRAIGNS And also that it was published for the public benefit ? THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY Yes . SIR EDWARD CARSON Of course , the costs of the defense will follow . JUDGE Yes . SIR EDWARD CARSON And Lord Queensberry may be discharged . JUDGE He may be discharged . ( Three strikes of the gavel ) JUDGE The court is adjourned . ( Gavel  --  Applause ) NARRATOR 2 From The Echo : NARRATOR 4 And so a most miserable case is ended . The Marquess of Queensberry is triumphant , and Mr. Oscar Wilde is " damned and done for . " He may now change places with the Marquess and go into the dock himself . NARRATOR 2 Outside the court , prostitutes were dancing on the pavement , lifting their skirts , capering joyfully at the downfall of one whom they regarded as a competitor in trade . PROSTITUTE At least he 'll have his hair cut reg'lar now ! EDWARD CLARKE What a filthy business . p. 56 NARRATOR 2 From Oscar Wilde by H. Montgomery Hyde : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OSCAR WILDE What happens now ? EDWARD CLARKE We have to wait and see if the Crown will prosecute you . NARRATOR 2 From The Daily Telegraph : NARRATOR 1 No sterner rebuke could well have been inflicted on some of the artistic tendencies of our time than the condemnation of Oscar Wilde at the Central Criminal Court . NARRATOR 2 Within minutes of his acquittal , the Marquess of Queensberry dispatched this letter to the Crown 's Director of Prosecutions : MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY To the Director of Public Prosecutions:Dear Sir , In order that there may be no miscarriage of justice I think it my duty at once to send you a copy of all our witnesses ' statements together with the shorthand notes of the trial . NARRATOR 2 This step placed the authorities under obligation to act at once.From The National Observer : NARRATOR 3 There is not a man or woman in the English-speaking world who is not under a debt of gratitude to the Marquess of Queensberry for destroying the high priest of the decadents . This is what art leads to . p. 57 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , the Crown decided that a warrant for Wilde 's arrest should at once be issued . NARRATOR 3 From The National Observer:There must be another trial at the Old Bailey , and of the Decadents , of their hideous conceptions of the meaning of Art , there must be an absolute end . NARRATOR 2 Oscar Wilde was charged with violation of clause 10 of section II of the Criminal Law Amendment Act signed the 1st of January 1885 by Queen Victoria : QUEEN VICTORIA Any male person who , in public or in private , commits or is party to the commission of , or procures the commission by any male person of any act of gross indecency with another male person , shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and GEORGE BERNARD SHAW I appeal now to the champions of individual rights . NARRATOR 2 George Bernard Shaw on the amendment : GEORGE BERNARD SHAW There is no justification for that law except the old theological one of making the secular arm the instrument of God 's vengeance . NARRATOR 2 Queen Victoria : QUEEN VICTORIA Shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall be liable , at the discretion of the court , to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years with or without hard labor . p. 58 NARRATOR 2 When asked to sign this bill , Queen Victoria was warned by one of her advisors that : NARRATOR 3 Mum , the bill does not include similar behavior between women . NARRATOR 2 To which she responded : QUEEN VICTORIA Women do n't do such things . NARRATOR 2 The bill was signed at once . It remained in effect until 1954 . ( Three strikes of the gavel ) NARRATOR 1 From court , Oscar Wilde went to the Cadogan Hotel , where Lord Alfred Douglas had taken a room . There he wrote to The Evening News , explaining the reason for his spectacular withdrawal from the case . OSCAR WILDE It would have been impossible for me to have proved my case without putting Lord Alfred Douglas in the witness box against his father . Lord Alfred was extremely anxious to go in the box but I would not let him do so . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to retire from the case , and to bear on my own shoulders whatever ignominy and shame might result from my prosecuting Lord Queensberry . NARRATOR 3 But nobody really believed this . Robert Sherard 's Life of Oscar Wilde . At the Cadogan Hotel , Wilde was advised by everyone to go at once to Dover and catch a boat train immediately to Calais . p. 59 EDWARD CLARKE The authorities were quite willing that he should go abroad . NARRATOR 1 From Clarke 's unpublished memoirs of the trial : EDWARD CLARKE As it was , the warrant was issued only after 5 P.M. , to allow him time to catch the last boat train to Calais . NARRATOR 4 From Oscar Wilde by Frank Harris : FRANK HARRIS At the Cadogan Hotel , Wilde sat as if glued to his chair , and drank hock and seltzer steadily in almost unbroken silence . MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY If the country allows you to leave , all the better for the country ! NARRATOR 2 From a note sent to the Cadogan Hotel : MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wherever you go and shoot you . NARRATOR 2 Oscar 's wife on hearing of the court 's decision said : CONSTANCE WILDE ( crying ) : I hope Oscar is going away abroad ! OSCAR WILDE I shall stay and do my sentence whatever that may be . FRANK HARRIS He then lapsed into inaction . p. 60 LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS Oscar , I will go to the House of Lords to talk to my cousin . I 'll see if he can use his influence to prevent a prosecution . ( He kisses OSCAR and exits . ) OSCAR WILDE With what a crash this fell.I thought but to defend him from his father ; I thought of nothing else and now FRANK HARRIS That was all he said . NARRATOR 4 At ten past six , two detectives came to the hotel . Wilde went gray in the face.Charles Richards : CHARLES RICHARDS I went with Sergeant Allen to the Cadogan Hotel , and saw the accused there . I said , Mr. Wilde , we are police officers and hold a warrant for your arrest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARLES RICHARDS You will have to go to Scotland Yard with me and then to Bow Street . OSCAR WILDE Can I have bail ? CHARLES RICHARDS I do n't think you can . I then conveyed Mr. Wilde to Scotland Yard . NARRATOR 1 Oscar Wilde was imprisoned on the 5th of April , and the trial was set for the 26th of April 1895 . MARQUESS OF QUEENSBERRY ( Euphoric ) : You know , I have not much to do with distinguished people , but I had a very nice letter from Lord Claud Hamilton , and a kind telegram from Mr. Charles Danby , the actor , with " Hearty Congratulations , " etcetera . A pile of messages wait for me at The National Observer and various clubs have telegraphed also . ( With a pile of messages ) @x ( chuckle ) I 'm on very slippery moral ground here . Ethically it does n't bother me that he lied . Alas , what they were trying to do I think was to fix homosexuality , to contain the disruption which Wilde presented , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of class , of gender , of hum sexuality , hum and they did that , very successfully . But of course by that point he had released these ideas into Western culture that you know are still there . p. 65 NARRATOR 5 From Oscar Wilde : A Summing Up by Lord Alfred Douglas : LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS After Oscar 's arrest , immediate ruin followed . He had two plays , An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest , running on the West End . He had been up till a week before the trial a comparatively rich man.Yet the moment he was arrested he was reduced to penury and assailed by all his creditors in a body while all his income simply stopped.He was of course condemned to pay all my father 's costs ; the managers suspended the performance of his plays ; an execution was put on his house and furniture and effects were sold for a song . AUCTIONEER By order of the sheriff , we will auction all the articles in this house , 16 Tite Street , Chelsea . ( Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five lots : A collection of manuscripts of Oscar Wilde 's poems.The original manuscripts of The Portrait of W. H.An autographed copy of Dorian Gray.Oscar Wilde 's life length portrait.A crayon drawing of a nude female by Whistler . ( The AUCTIONEER continues auctioning the items as DOUGLAS proceeds . ) LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS On that day , Wilde 's " House Beautiful " presented a pitiful picture : it was overrun by a whole crowd of curiosos , idlers , and rumor mongers . Doors were broken open , valuables were stolen , and the entire sale was carried on amidst scenes of chaotic disorder.Several original manuscripts mysteriously disappeared and have never since been recovered . p. 66 AUCTIONEER A draft of the play A Florentine Tragedy . Do I hear four pounds ? LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS From affluence he passed suddenly to dire poverty at a time when money was needed for his defense . ( The sound of the auction grows . DOUGLAS is forced to raise his voice . ) Oscar was imprisoned in Holloway Gaol as he waited for another trial . ( WILDE enters escorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there every day in the ghastly way that visits are arranged in prisons . The visitor goes into a box rather like the box in a pawn shop . There are rows and rows of these boxes , each occupied by a visitor and opposite , the prisoner . AUCTIONEER Oscar Wilde 's life length portrait . I should like to start the bidding for this lot at seven pounds . Do I hear seven pounds LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS We were separated by a corridor about a yard in width and a warder passed up and down between us . ( Shouting ) We had to shout to make our voices heard above the voices of other prisoners and visitors.Nothing more revolting and cruel and deliberately malignant could be devised by human ingenuity.Poor Oscar was rather deaf . He could hardly hear what I said in this tower of Babel . He just looked at me with tears running down his cheeks and I looked at him . p. 67 EDWARD CLARKE Mr. Justice , my client has been in jail for twenty days . The court date is not set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bail . JUDGE There is no worse crime than that with which the prisoner has been charged . I therefore refuse bail . AUCTIONEER Sold . ( AUCTIONEER and JUDGE hit their gavels three times in unison . Absolute silence ensues . ) LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS Oscar , I know I always advised you to fight my father , but I am not impervious to reason . If Clarke had assured me that you had no chance , and were merely cutting your own throat and playing into my father 's hands , I would have been convinced , Oscar . I never intended for this to happen . OSCAR WILDE The real tragedies in life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence , their absolute incoherence , their absurd want of meaning ( The guard escorts WILDE out . ) NARRATOR 5 On the day Oscar Wilde was arrested , six hundred gentlemen left England for the continent on a night when usually sixty people traveled . Every train to Dover was crowded , every steamer to Calais thronged with members from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOUGLAS Oscar and his legal advisors urged me to go to France before the second trial . They assured me that my presence in the country could only do Oscar harm . They said that if I were to be called to the witness stand , I should infallibly destroy what small chance he had for acquittal.His solicitors also told me that unless I left the country , Sir Edward Clarke , who was defending Oscar for no charge , would throw up his defense.So I embarked for France on the day before the trial , the 25th of April 1895 . It would be two years before I was to see him again . p. 69 Act 2 , Scene 2 : The Second Trial THE SECOND TRIAL NARRATOR 5 London , 26th of April 1895 , Old Bailey Central Criminal Court , Regina vs . Wilde . Opening speech for the prosecution . Mr. Charles Gill . ( Gavel ) CHARLES GILL May it please you , my lord , gentlemen of the jury . This case has received much attention in the press . I must beg you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or read about the prisoner and to abandon all prejudice towards either side , and to approach the case with absolutely open minds , carefully and impartially.The charge against Mr. Oscar Wilde is that he committed acts of gross indecency with the following male persons : Charles Parker , Frederick Atkins , Sidney Mavor , and Alfred Wood . NARRATOR 5 Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde , do you plead guilty or not guilty ? OSCAR WILDE I plead not guilty . NARRATOR 5 George Bernard Shaw on the plea of not guilty : GEORGE BERNARD SHAW Wilde could plead not guilty with perfect sincerity and indeed could not honestly put in any other plea . Guilty or not guilty is a question not of fact but of morals . The prisoner who pleads not guilty is not alleging that he did this or did not do that ; he is affirming that what he did does not involve any guilt on his part.A man rightly accused of homosexuality is perfectly entitled to plead not guilty in the legal sense . He might admit that he was technically guilty of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him that he was guilty of a sin against the moral law , but if he believes , as Wilde certainly did , that homosexuality is not a crime , he is perfectly entitled to say he is not guilty of it . p. 70 CHARLES GILL Gentlemen , the prisoner Wilde is well known as a dramatic author and generally as a literary man of unusual attainments . However , we must bear in mind the terrible risks involved in certain artistic and literary phases of the day.I will begin by reading to the jury the transcripts of the trial of Oscar Wilde vs. the Marquess of Queensberry , specifically , the cross-examination of Wilde on literature , The Chameleon and Dorian Gray . EDWARD CLARKE My lord , I do not think it fair of Mr. Gill to insist upon reading this . It is not fair to judge a man by his books . CHARLES GILL This is examination as to character . JUDGE You may proceed . CHARLES GILL The following is from the transcripts of the first trial : Mr. Carson asked Mr. Wilde : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no such thing as an immoral book ? Mr. Wilde replied : Yes.Carson : Am I right in saying that you do not consider the effect in creating morality or immorality ? Wilde : In writing a play or a book , I am concerned entirely with literature , that is , with art . OSCAR WILDE Art has a spiritual ministry . It can raise and sanctify everything it touches , and popular disapproval must not impede its progress.Art is what makes the life of each citizen a sacrament . Art is what makes the life of the whole race immortal . p. 71 NARRATOR 5 From The English Renaissance of Art : OSCAR WILDE The arts are the only civilizing influences in the world , and without them people are barbarians . An aesthetic education , which humanizes people , is far more important even for politicians than an economic education , which does the opposite . CHARLES GILL Carson asked : Is that good for the young ? Wilde : Anything is good that stimulates thought in any age . OSCAR WILDE Children should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but should learn in a workshop how art might offer a new history of the world , with a promise of the brotherhood of man , of peace rather than war , of praise of God 's handymanship , of new imagination and new beauty . CHARLES GILL Carson asked : I take it that no matter how immoral a book might be , if it is well written it would be , in your opinion , a good book ? Wilde : Yes , if it were well written so as to produce a sense of beauty . OSCAR WILDE With the English Renaissance of Art I hoped to create an artistic movement that might change , as it has changed , the face of England.As time goes on , the men and the forms of expression will change , but the principle remains:The object of art is to stir the most divine and remote chords which make music in our soul.Man is hungry for beauty . There is a void.We spend our days looking for the secret of life . Well , the secret of life is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral or immoral ? Wilde : There is no such thing as morality or immorality in thought . OSCAR WILDE I have never come across anyone in whom the moral sense was dominant who was not heartless , cruel , vindictive , log-stupid , and entirely lacking in the smallest sense of humanity . Moral people , as they are termed , are simple beasts . I would sooner have fifty unnatural vices than one unnatural virtue.The real enemy of modern life , of everything that makes life lovely and joyous and colored for us , is Puritanism , and the Puritan spirit . There is the great danger that lies ahead of the age.Puritanism is not a theory of life . It is merely an explanation of the English middle classes . CHARLES GILL Carson : Let us go over it phrase by phrase : I quite admit that I adored you madly . OSCAR WILDE Whenever a community or a government of any kind attempts to dictate to the artist what he is to do , art either entirely vanishes or becomes stereotyped , or degenerates into a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is most suitable to the artist is no government at all . CHARLES GILL Carson : Do you mean to say that passage describes the natural feeling of one man towards another ? OSCAR WILDE Modern morality consists in accepting the standards of one 's age . I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standards of his age is the grossest immorality. p. 73 WILDE AND GILL It would be the influence produced by a beautiful personality . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS Dear Oscar , I have just arrived here . NARRATOR 5 Douglas writes from the Htel des Deux Mondes in Paris : LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS They are very nice here , and I can stay as long as I like without paying my bill , which is a good thing as I am quite penniless . The proprietor asked after you at once and expressed his regret and indignation at the treatment you are receiving.Do keep up your spirit , my dearest darling . I continue to think of you day and night and send you all my love . I am always your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now proceed to question the men with whom Mr. Wilde is accused to have committed the acts of gross indecency . I ask you to pay close attention to the testimony of these boys . ( Music  --  " Rule Britannia " coming from a music box . Four young men enter in Victorian underwear and set up the " shameful den . " ) NARRATOR 5 The court calls Charles Parker . CHARLES GILL Please state your age . CHARLES PARKER I am twenty-one years of age . CHARLES GILL Do you have family in London ? p. 74 CHARLES PARKER I have a brother , William . CHARLES GILL What is your occupation ? CHARLES PARKER I have been engaged as a valet and my brother as a groom . CHARLES GILL When did you first meet Mr. Alfred Taylor ? CHARLES PARKER At the beginning of 1893 , I was out of employment . One day I was with my brother at the St. James 's Restaurant , in the bar . While there Taylor came up and spoke to us . He was an entire stranger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a drink . We got into conversation with him . He spoke about men . CHARLES GILL In what way ? CHARLES PARKER He called attention to the prostitutes who frequent Piccadilly Circus and remarked , " I ca n't understand sensible men wasting their money on painted trash like that . Many do , though . But there are a few who know better . Now , you could get money in a certain way easily enough if you cared to . " I understood to what Taylor alluded and made a coarse reply . CHARLES GILL I am obliged to ask you what it was you actually said . CHARLES PARKER I do not like to say . CHARLES GILL You were less squeamish at the time , I dare say . I ask you for the words . p. 75 CHARLES PARKER I said that if any old gentleman with money took a fancy to me , I was agreeable . ( The audience gasps . ) I was agreeable . I was terribly hard up . ( Laughter ) CHARLES GILL What did Taylor say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said he could introduce us to a man who was good for plenty of money . If we were interested , we were to meet him ( Taylor ) at the St. James 's bar . We went there the next evening . We were shown upstairs to a private room in which there was a dinner table laid for four . After a while Wilde came in and I was formally introduced . I had never seen him before , but I had heard of him . We dined about eight o'clock . We all four sat down to dinner , Wilde sitting on my left . CHARLES GILL Who made the fourth ? CHARLES PARKER My brother , William Parker . I had promised Taylor that he should accompany me . CHARLES GILL Was the dinner a good dinner ? CHARLES PARKER Yes . The table was lighted with red-shaded candles . We had plenty of champagne with our dinner and brandy and coffee afterwards . Wilde paid for the dinner . p. 76 CHARLES GILL What happened after dinner ? CHARLES PARKER Wilde said to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the Savoy Hotel with me ? " I consented , and Wilde drove me in a cab to the hotel . CHARLES GILL More drink was offered you there ? CHARLES PARKER Yes , we had liqueurs . Wilde then asked me to go into his bedroom with him . CHARLES GILL Let us know what occurred there . MARVIN PARKER He committed the act of sodomy upon me . ( The court becomes very agitated . ) MARVIN TAYLOR From this moment on , Oscar Wilde 's name would not be associated with Hellenism or Aestheticism or revolutionary artistic ideals but with homosexuality . He would become the body type , he would become the body type of the invert , of the third sex or whatever . You know . Sociological or medical descriptions for the male homosexual from that period on . CHARLES GILL Did Wilde give you any money that night ? CHARLES PARKER Before I left , Wilde gave me 2 , telling me to call at the Savoy Hotel in a week . I went there about a week afterwards at eleven o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I left , he gave me 3. p. 77 CHARLES GILL What happened at that occasion ? CHARLES PARKER I was asked by Wilde to imagine that I was a woman and that he was my lover . I had to keep up this illusion . I used to sit on his knees and he used to put his as a man might amuse himself with a girl . Wilde insisted on this filthy make-believe being kept up . CHARLES GILL Apart from money , did Wilde give you any presents ? CHARLES PARKER Yes , he gave me a silver cigarette case and a gold ring . I do n't suppose boys are different to girls in acquiring presents from them who are fond of them . ( Gavel ) NARRATOR 5 The cross-examination of Charles Parker by Sir Edward Clarke : EDWARD CLARKE Did you state at Bow Street that you received 30 from a gentleman to not accuse him of sodomy with you ? CHARLES PARKER Yes . I stated at the Police Court that I had received 30 , part of monies extorted from a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the Duke  --  EDWARD CLARKE I do n't ask the name of the gentleman from whom the money was extorted , but I do ask the names of the men who got the money and gave you 30 ? p. 78 CHARLES PARKER Alfred Wood and John Allen . EDWARD CLARKE When had the incident occurred in consequence of which you received the 30  --  how long before ? CHARLES PARKER I can not think . EDWARD CLARKE You had had indecent behavior with the gentleman in question ? CHARLES PARKER Yes , but only on one occasion . EDWARD CLARKE Did the gentleman come to your room ? CHARLES PARKER Yes . EDWARD CLARKE By your invitation ? CHARLES PARKER He asked me if he could come . EDWARD CLARKE And you took him home with you ? CHARLES PARKER Yes . EDWARD CLARKE Did Wood and Allen happen to come into the room while the gentleman was there ? CHARLES PARKER Yes . EDWARD CLARKE Then they threatened the gentleman with divulging what they had seen ? CHARLES PARKER Yes . EDWARD CLARKE How much did Wood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't remember . EDWARD CLARKE Try and remember . CHARLES PARKER 300 or 400 . EDWARD CLARKE Now , you say positively that Mr. Wilde committed sodomy with you at the Savoy ? CHARLES PARKER Yes . EDWARD CLARKE But you have been in the habit of accusing other gentlemen of the same offense ? CHARLES PARKER Never , unless it has been done . EDWARD CLARKE I submit that you blackmail gentlemen . CHARLES PARKER No , sir . Wood and Allen did that . ( Laughter in the court ) EDWARD CLARKE When Taylor asked you if you ever went with men and got money for it , did you understand what he meant ? CHARLES PARKER Yes . EDWARD CLARKE You had heard of such things before ? CHARLES PARKER Yes . EDWARD CLARKE You understood the practices you were going to enter upon ? CHARLES PARKER Yes . EDWARD CLARKE So you were in no way corrupted by Mr. Wilde . p. 80 CHARLES PARKER ( reluctantly ) : No . EDWARD CLARKE Nothing more with this witness . NARRATOR 5 From De Profundis : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never did them any harm . I never tried to be anything but kind to them . NARRATOR 5 From a letter from Paris : LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS Oscar , these men are being maintained at Chiswick by the Crown . They have been receiving 5 per week from the beginning of your prosecution of my father until now . Charles Parker even received a brand new suit of clothes at the Crown 's expense . NARRATOR 5 The Court calls Alfred Wood . CHARLES GILL When did you first meet Alfred Taylor ? ALFRED WOOD In January 1893 . CHARLES GILL When did you move into his house ? ALFRED WOOD In January 1893 . I was out of a job and I had nowhere to go . CHARLES GILL How long did you stay there ? ALFRED WOOD I lived with him for three weeks .

ALFRED WOOD After dinner I went with Mr. Wilde to 16 Tite Street . CHARLES GILL Is n't that where he lives with his wife and two children ? ALFRED WOOD Yes . ( Audience gasps . ) But there was nobody in the house , to my knowledge . NARRATOR 5 From An Ideal Husband : OSCAR WILDE People ask me why were you so weak to yield to such temptation . Weak ! I am sick of hearing that word . Weak ? Do they really think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you there are terrible temptations that it requires strength , strength and courage to yield to . To stake all one 's life on a single moment , to risk everything on one throw , there is no weakness in that . There is a horrible , terrible courage .

Mr. Wilde used his influence to induce me to consent . He made me nearly drunk . CHARLES GILL Did Wilde give you any money that night ? ALFRED WOOD Yes , at the Florence . About 3 I think it was .

ALFRED WOOD 175 . EDWARD CLARKE What for ? ALFRED WOOD Well , it was given me by Allen . EDWARD CLARKE Nothing more with this witness . NARRATOR 5 From De Profundis : OSCAR WILDE People thought it dreadful of me to have entertained at dinner these men , and to have found pleasure in their company . But then , from my point of view , they were delightfully suggestive and stimulating . It was like feasting with panthers . They were to me like the brightest of gilded snakes , their poison was part of their perfection . I did not know that when they were to strike at me , it was to be at another 's piping and another 's pay . NARRATOR 5 The court calls Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATKINS I am twenty years old .

I 'll introduce you . " It was arranged that we should dine at Kettner 's Restaurant the next evening . When I got there , Taylor said , " I 'm glad you 've made yourself pretty . Mr. Wilde likes nice clean boys . " That was the first time Wilde 's name was mentioned . p. 89 CHARLES GILL What happened next ? SIDNEY MAVOR On our arrival at the restaurant we were shown into a private room . Wilde came in with another gentleman . I believe the other gentleman was Lord Alfred Douglas .

Wilde said to Taylor , " Our little lad has pleasing manners . We must see more of him . " Wilde took my address , and soon afterwards I received a silver cigarette case with my Christian name scratched inside it . It was inscribed " Sidney from O. W. , October , 1892 . " LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS I went up to him and shook hands and said : Sidney , surely you are not going to give evidence against Oscar ?

SIDNEY MAVOR No . No misconduct ever took place between Mr. Wilde and me . CHARLES GILL Mr. Mavor , I repeat the question : Did any misconduct take place that night ? SIDNEY MAVOR No .

The opening speech for the defense , Sir Edward Clarke : EDWARD CLARKE This trial seems to be operating as an act of indemnity for all the blackmailers in London . In testifying on behalf of the Crown they have received immunity for past rogueries and indecencies , these men who ought to be the accused , not the accusers.You must not act upon suspicion or prejudice , but upon examination of the facts , gentlemen , and on the facts , I respectfully urge that Mr. Wilde is entitled to claim from you a verdict of acquittal.It was Mr. Wilde 's act , and Mr. Wilde 's act alone , in charging Lord Queensberry with libel which has brought the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peril.Men who have been charged with the offenses alleged against Mr. Wilde shrink from investigation . Mr. Wilde taking the initiative of a public trial is evidence of his innocence . Nor is that all . A few days before the first trial , notice was given of certain charges made against him with the names of these young men . Mr. Wilde knew the catalogue of accusations . Gentlemen of the jury , do you believe that had he been guilty he would have stayed in England and faced those accusations ? What would you think of a man who , knowing himself to be guilty and that evidence would be forthcoming from half-a-dozen different places , insisted on bringing his case before the world ? Insane would hardly be the word for it if Mr. Wilde really had been guilty and yet faced that investigation . p. 92 NARRATOR 5 The examination of Oscar Wilde by Sir Edward Clarke : EDWARD CLARKE With reference to the Queensberry trial , was the evidence you gave on that occasion absolutely and in all respects true ? OSCAR WILDE Entirely true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youths have said is true ? OSCAR WILDE I have been acquainted with all of them , but nothing ever happened with any one of them . EDWARD CLARKE Of what Charles Parker said , what is untrue ? OSCAR WILDE Where he says he came to the Savoy Hotel and that I committed acts of indecency with him . He never went to the Savoy with me to supper . It is true that he dined with me . The rest is untrue . EDWARD CLARKE Alfred Wood . OSCAR WILDE It is entirely untrue that he ever went to Tite Street with me at all . EDWARD CLARKE Fred Atkins . OSCAR WILDE It is not true when he says he came into my room and saw me with Mr. Schwabe in bed . Mr. Schwabe was in Paris , and it is true that Atkins slept in the room he described next to mine . p. 93 EDWARD CLARKE Why did you ask Sidney Mavor to spend the night with you at the Albermarle ? OSCAR WILDE As company for me and a compliment for himself . NARRATOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred Douglas : LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS It would have been infinitely better if Oscar had told the truth . Of course , everyone would have told him that to do so would be utterly fatal . But if he had had the courage to do it , he stood a chance of striking a blow for justice by telling the truth and saying what he really thought and passionately believed . NARRATOR 5 The cross-examination of Oscar Wilde by Mr. Charles Gill : CHARLES GILL Mr. Wilde , why did you take up with these youths ? OSCAR WILDE I am a lover of youth . ( Laughter ) CHARLES GILL You exalt youth as a sort of god ? OSCAR WILDE I like to study the young in everything . There is something fascinating in youthfulness . CHARLES GILL How old was Lord Alfred Douglas when you met him ? OSCAR WILDE Twenty years old . p. 94 CHARLES GILL Did Lord Alfred Douglas contribute some verses to The Chameleon ? OSCAR WILDE Yes . CHARLES GILL The poems in question were somewhat peculiar ? OSCAR WILDE They certainly were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHARLES GILL You described them as beautiful poems ? OSCAR WILDE I said something tantamount to that . The verses were original in theme and construction , and I admired them . CHARLES GILL The following poem is called " Two Loves . " In it , two boys meet . One boy says : " I am true Love , I fillThe hearts of boy and girl with mutual flame . Then sighing , the other says , Have thy will , I am the Love that dare not speak its name. " Was that poem explained to you ? OSCAR WILDE I think it is clear . CHARLES GILL There is no question as to what it means ? OSCAR WILDE Most certainly not . CHARLES GILL Is it not clear that the love described relates to natural love and unnatural love ? p. 95 OSCAR WILDE No . CHARLES GILL What is the " Love that dare not speak its name " ? OSCAR WILDE The " Love that dare not speak its name " in this century is such a great affection of an elder for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy , and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare . It is that deep , spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect . It dictates and pervades great works of art like those of Shakespeare and Michelangelo , and those two letters of mine , such as they are . It is in this century misunderstood , so much misunderstood that it may be described as the " Love that dare not speak its name , " and on account of it I am placed where I am now . It is beautiful , it is fine , it is the noblest form of affection . There is nothing unnatural about it . It is intellectual , and it repeatedly exists between an elder and a younger man when the elder man has intellect and the younger man has all the joy , hope , and glamour of life before him . That it should be so the world does not understand . The world mocks at it and sometimes puts one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some hisses . ) JUDGE Order ! ( Three strikes of the gavel ) Order ! ( Three strikes of the gavel ) Order ! ( Three strikes of the gavel ) If there is the slightest manifestation of feeling I shall have the court cleared . Complete silence must be preserved . p. 96 CHARLES GILL With regard to your friendship towards the men who have given evidence , may I take it that it was , as you describe , Mr. Wilde , a deep affection of an elder man for a younger ? OSCAR WILDE Certainly not ! One feels that once in one 's life , and once only , towards anybody . NARRATOR 5 From The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas : LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS I am proud to have been loved by a great poet . There will always be one thousand Queensberrys for one Oscar Wilde . CHARLES GILL Nothing more with this witness . ( Three strikes of the gavel ) JUDGE Gentlemen of the jury , I have received a communication from you to the effect that you are unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is so , my lord . We can not agree . JUDGE Is there any prospect that if you retired to your room and continued your deliberations for a while longer you would be able to come to an agreement ? THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY I put that also to my fellow-jurymen . We have considered the question for three hours , and we can not agree . JUDGE That being so , I do not feel justified in detaining you any longer . The prisoner will be held in prison until further notice . I will see counsel in my chambers to set the date for the next trial . This court is adjourned ! ( Three strikes of the gavel ) p. 97 NARRATOR 5 Sir Edward Clarke applied for bail and it was refused by the trial judge . Wilde was imprisoned again.Four days later , Clarke applied again and bail was granted , by another judge , in the extortionate sum of 5,000 . From Oscar Wilde by Sheridan Morley:Wilde went to the Midland Hotel and dinner was ordered . No sooner had he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOTEL MANAGER You are Oscar Wilde , I believe . OSCAR WILDE Yes . HOTEL MANAGER You must leave this hotel at once ! NARRATOR 5 From this hotel he went to another on the outskirts of London . He sunk down exhausted on the bed of the room . The landlord appeared . LANDLORD Sir , I am sorry , but you have been followed by a band of prize-fighters . They say they will sack the house and raze the street if you stay here a moment longer . I must insist that you leave . NARRATOR 5 At last , after midnight , he arrived at his mother 's house in Oakley Street . OSCAR WILDE Give me shelter , Willie . Let me lie on the floor or I shall die in the streets . WILLIE Come in . NARRATOR 5 His brother Willie : p. 98 WILLIE ( drunk ) : Thank God my vices are decent . NARRATOR 5 Frank Harris came to see him in Oakley Street the following morning . OSCAR WILDE I feel that public disgrace is in store for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror was before . I know it now . It is as if a hand of ice were laid upon one 's heart . It 's as if one 's heart were beating itself to death in some empty hollow . FRANK HARRIS Oscar , I have a yacht waiting to take you to France . You must go ! OSCAR WILDE I ca n't , Frank , I ca n't . FRANK HARRIS Listen , Oscar . I will not cross my arms and let that band of crooks get the best of you . OSCAR WILDE Oh , Frank , you talk with passion and conviction , as if I were innocent . FRANK HARRIS But you are innocent , are n't you ? OSCAR WILDE No , Frank . I thought you knew that all along . FRANK HARRIS No . I did not know . I did not believe the accusation . I did not believe it for a moment . I thought that men confuse the artistic nature with that vice but OSCAR WILDE What you call vice , Frank , is not vice . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference to you , Frank ? p. 99 FRANK HARRIS No . Curiously enough it has made no difference to me at all . I do not know why ; I suppose I have got more sympathy than morality in me . It has surprised me , dumb-founded me . The thing has always seemed fantastic and incredible to me . And now you make it exist for me . But it has no effect on my friendship , none upon my resolve to help you . OSCAR WILDE You have been a good friend to me , a thoroughly good friend . FRANK HARRIS I do n't know I have been able to do much for you . In fact , I have not been able to do anything for you , as I can see . I am thoroughly disappointed with myself . OSCAR WILDE You have enabled me to tell you the truth , that is something . To speak the truth is a painful thing . To be forced to tell lies is much worse . FRANK HARRIS Well , now I must take you away immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank , but it 's impossible . Quite impossible . I should be arrested before I left London , and shamed again in public . They would boo at me and shout insults . Oh ! It is impossible . I could not risk it . FRANK HARRIS Nonsense ! I believe the authorities would be only too glad if you went . OSCAR WILDE And what about the people who have stood bail for me ? I could n't leave them to suffer . They would lose their thousands . p. 100 FRANK HARRIS I sha n't let them lose . I 'm quite willing to take half on my shoulders at once . And you can pay the other thousand or so within a very short time by writing a couple of plays . American papers would be only too glad to pay you for an interview . The story of your escape would be worth a thousand pounds . They would give you almost any price for it . Leave everything to me . NARRATOR 5 Wilde 's family had other opinions . His brother : WILLIE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay and face the music . NARRATOR 5 His mother : SPERANZA If you stay , no matter what happens , you will always be my son . If you leave , I shall never talk to you again . NARRATOR 5 His wife : CONSTANCE WILDE You must go , Oscar . NARRATOR 5 A letter from Oscar Wilde to Bosie on the evening of his third trial : OSCAR WILDE I have decided that it is nobler and more beautiful to stay . We can not be together . I do not want to be called a coward or a deserter . A false name , a disguise , a hunted life , all that is not for me . Oh sweetest of all boys , most loved of all loves , my soul clings to your soul , my life to your life , and in all the worlds of pain and pleasure you are my ideal of admiration and joy . p. 101 NARRATOR 5 From The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas : LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS I do n't like to think of it , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insane thing not to go , and that really leaving would have been a braver thing to do . NARRATOR 4 An official announcement : The next trial will not be led by Mr. Gill . The Crown is naming Frank Lockwood , the Solicitor-General , as the prosecution attorney . NARRATOR 1 From a letter sent by Douglas to the French magazine Mercure de France : LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS The third trial is a result of a political intrigue . The government does not wish to let the prosecution of Oscar Wilde take its regular course . NARRATOR 2 From Oscar Wilde by H. Montgomery Hyde : Carson , who had refused to be the Crown 's prosecutor against Wilde , now went to Lockwood and said : SIR EDWARD CARSON Can not you let up on the fellow now ? The jury was deadlocked , Frank . LOCKWOOD I would , but we can not , we dare not . It would at once be said both in England and abroad that , owing to the nature of this case , we were forced to abandon it . LORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the liberal party presently contains a large number of men that have the same inclinations as Wilde does . People are talking about them . To hush up these rumors , Oscar must be found guilty . p. 102 SIR EDWARD CARSON Wilde has suffered a great deal . In addition , he has already spent over a month in prison , with no possibility of bail , just awaiting a trial . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS I would wish to ask the Home Secretary this : Is it not true that you have been threatened by the Prime Minister that if a second trial was not instituted and a verdict of guilty obtained against Mr. Wilde , the liberal party would be removed from power ? LOCKWOOD I ca n't , Edward . It would be seen as an act of weakness . Besides , many people in this government are said to be implicated in similar affairs . It would be said that it is because of those people that we are forced to abandon the case . We must go on till the end . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice of a great poet to save a degraded band of politicians . NARRATOR 1 The Mercure de France refused to publish Douglas 's letter . p. 103 Act 2 , Scene 3 : The Third Trial THE THIRD TRIAL NARRATOR 4 The third trial , Old Bailey Central Criminal Court , Regina vs . Wilde . LOCKWOOD I am bound to assume that , as you are an entirely fresh jury , you are totally ignorant of all the facts which have been elucidated in the previous trial of the prisoner . It will , therefore , be necessary to go through the entire case again in detail . ( WILDE reacts . He is exhausted , desperate . ) ( During this segment , the sound of a heartbeat can be heard , in a gradual crescendo , until Wilde 's speech ending in " If hatred gives you pleasure , indulge it . " ) The defendant is charged with having committed offenses under section 2 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 : Gross indecency with male persons . He has repeatedly used his influence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men into the most vicious and depraved conduct . NARRATOR 5 From De Profundis : OSCAR WILDE I remember when I was sitting in the dock on my last trial , listening to Lockwood 's appalling denunciation of me  --  like a thing out of Tacitus , like a passage in Dante  --  and being sickened with horror at what I heard . LOCKWOOD That Wilde has been at the center of a circle of hideous corruption among young men it is impossible to doubt p. 104 CHARLES PARKER My name is Charles Parker , I 'm twenty-one years of age . Mr. Wilde committed sodomy with me on OSCAR WILDE I must say to myself that I ruined myself , and that nobody great or small can be ruined except by their own hand . This pitiless indictment I bring without pity against myself . I let myself be lured into long spells of senseless and sensual ease . ALFRED WOOD My name is Alfred Wood , I 'm twenty-two years old , Mr. Wilde OSCAR WILDE I surrounded myself with the smaller natures and the meaner minds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careless of the lives of others . I took pleasure where it pleased me and passed on . FRED ATKINS My name is Fred Atkins , I am twenty years old . Three times Mr. Wilde OSCAR WILDE I forgot that every little action of the common day makes or unmakes character , and that therefore what one does in the secret chamber one has some day to cry aloud on the housetops . LOCKWOOD The Crown will present witnesses that will on oath state that WILLIAM PARKER I am the brother of Charles Parker . My brother accepted a preserved cherry from Wilde 's own mouth . p. 105 OSCAR WILDE I blame myself terribly . As I sit here , a ruined man , it is myself I blame . MRS . ELLEN GRANT I am the landlady . The windows were never opened or cleaned , and the daylight was never admitted . OSCAR WILDE While there is nothing wrong in what I did , there is something wrong in what I became . THOMAS PRICE I am a waiter at a private hotel at 10 St. James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior station called there to see Wilde . OSCAR WILDE How weary I am of the whole thing , of the shame and the struggling and the hatred . To see those people coming into the box one after the other to witness against me makes me sick . GEORGE FREDERICK CLARIDGE I am a silversmith . I supplied Mr. Wilde with silver cigarette cases . OSCAR WILDE Reason does not help me . It tells me that the law under which I 'm being judged is a wrong and unfair law , and the system under which I 'm suffering , a wrong and unjust system . MARY APPLEGATE I am the housekeeper . After Mr. Wilde 's visit , the sheets were stained in a peculiar way . OSCAR WILDE The world is growing more tolerant . One day you will be ashamed of your treatment of me. p. 106 ANTONIO MIGGE I am professor of massage . Once I saw a young man in bed with Mr. Wilde . I never attended Mr. Wilde again . OSCAR WILDE I feel inclined to stretch out my hands and cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in God 's name , only do it quickly . Can you not see I 'm worn out ? If hatred gives you pleasure , indulge it . ( Silence ) LOCKWOOD When did your acquaintance with Lord Alfred Douglas begin ? OSCAR WILDE In 1892 . LOCKWOOD And when did the Marquess of Queensberry first object ? OSCAR WILDE In April 1894 . ( WILDE is exhausted . ) LOCKWOOD Mr. Wilde , where is Lord Alfred Douglas now ? OSCAR WILDE He is abroad . LOCKWOOD Where ? OSCAR WILDE In Paris , at the Htel des Deux Mondes . LOCKWOOD Of course you have been in communication with him . OSCAR WILDE Certainly . These charges are founded on sand . Our friendship is founded on a rock . There has been no need to cancel the acquaintance . p. 107 LOCKWOOD This is from the now notorious prose-poem you wrote to Lord Alfred Douglas : " My own dear boy , Your sonnet is quite lovely . " Why did you choose the words " My own dear boy " ? OSCAR WILDE My dearest boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas written on the final night of the trials from Holloway Prison : OSCAR WILDE This is to assure you of my immortal , my eternal love for you . Tomorrow all will be over . LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS ( reading ) : If prison and dishonor be my destiny , think that my love for you and this idea , this still more divine belief that you love me in return will sustain me in my unhappiness and will make me capable , I hope , of bearing my grief most patiently . OSCAR WILDE Since the hope , nay rather the certainty , of meeting you again in some world is the goal and the encouragement of my present life , I must continue to live in this world because of that . LOCKWOOD Was it a decent way to address a young man ? OSCAR WILDE I am so happy that you 've gone away ! I know what that must have cost you . It would have been agony for me to think that you were in England when your name was mentioned in court . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OSCAR WILDE I hope you have copies of all my books . All mine have been sold . I stretch out my hands toward you . Oh ! That I may live to touch your hair and your hands . I feel certain that your love will watch over my life . Try to let me hear from you soon . LOCKWOOD Was it sensual love ? OSCAR WILDE I am writing you this letter in the midst of great suffering  --  this long day in court has exhausted me.Dearest boy , sweetest of all young men , most loved and most lovable : Wait for me ! LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS ( Reading ) : Wait for me ! I am now , as ever since the day we met , yours devoutly and with an immortal love , WILDE AND DOUGLAS Oscar . LOCKWOOD What was the charge which Lord Queensberry made against you ? OSCAR WILDE ( shouting ) : Posing sodomite . ( Three strikes of the gavel . The actors move about the stage in a fury . ) NARRATOR 3 Gentlemen of the jury , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe . NARRATOR 4 I would rather try the most shocking murder case that has ever fallen to my lot to try than be engaged in a case of this description . p. 109 NARRATOR 1 It is a case which , notwithstanding the horrible nature of the charges involved , calls for the cold , calm , resolute administration of justice . NARRATOR 2 Oscar Wilde is an artist who exercised considerable influence over young men . NARRATOR 6 He has used his art to subvert morality NARRATORS 4 AND 6 and to encourage unnatural vice . OSCAR WILDE I was a man who stood in symbolic relation to the art and culture of my age . Few men hold such a position in their own lifetime and have it so acknowledged.I had genius , a distinguished name , high social position , brilliancy , intellectual daring . I made art a philosophy , and philosophy an art . I altered the minds of men and the colors of things . There was nothing I said or did that did not make people wonder . Whatever I touched I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art as the supreme reality and life as a mere mode of fiction . I awoke the imagination of my century so that it created myth and legend around me . I summed up all systems in a phrase , and all existence in an epigram . ( Three strikes of the gavel ) THE CLERK OF ARRAIGNS Gentlemen , have you agreed upon a verdict ? THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY Yes , we have . p. 110 THE CLERK OF ARRAIGNS Do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty of acts of gross indecency ? THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY We find him guilty , my lord . JUDGE Oscar Wilde , the crime of which you have been convicted is so bad that one has to put a firm restraint upon oneself to prevent oneself from describing , in terms I would rather not use , the sentiments which must rise to the breast of every man of honor who has heard the details of these terrible three trials.It is no use for me to address you . People who can do these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not hope to produce any effect upon them.This is the worst case I have ever tried.I shall , under such circumstances , be expected to pass the severest sentence allowed by the law . It is in my opinion , totally inadequate for such a case as this.The sentence of the court is that you be imprisoned and kept to hard labor for two years . ( Cries of oh ! oh ! and Shame ! ) OSCAR WILDE And I ? May I say nothing , my lord ? NARRATOR 2 His lordship made no reply beyond a wave of the hand to the warders , who hurried the prisoner out of sight . ( WILDE exits . ) JUDGE The jury is discharged . The court is adjourned . ( Three strikes of the gavel )
