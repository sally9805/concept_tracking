<p> The killing of Palestinians on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem was more than just another turn in an endless cycle of violence . The event , and Israeli handling of it , have terrible implications for Israel 's future . <p> The cycle of violence began in the Zionist years even before the Jewish state was born in 1948 . Its people had to live with hate and fear . Israel was attacked by its neighbors , ostracized , told it had no right to exist . Terrorists murdered its athletes , its children . <p> In those circumstances , Israelis understandably became a hard-shelled people . They said to themselves : When we are treated as we are - and have been persecuted over the centuries - why should we listen to the world 's advice ? We must look out for ourselves : go it alone . <p> In some Israelis , too , there developed another reaction to living under the gun , understandable but sad . That was indifference to the suffering of others . Just as they were treated as less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated Palestinians without understanding or sympathy . <p> Those trends were exacerbated by the growth of religious-nationalist expansionism after the 1967 war . Settlements were planted all over the occupied West Bank , without regard for the feelings or the human rights of the Palestinians who lived there . Their land was seized . They were allowed no voice and no vote . <p> Israeli law promised equal justice . But Palestinians could be detained without trial , deported , their homes bulldozed . Israelis who killed Palestinians , and were convicted of having done so without justification , often drew sentences that were a mere slap on the wrist . <p> And so we come to the events of Monday . Palestinians on the Temple Mount began throwing stones at Jews worshiping , on a religious holiday , at the Western Wall below . The only security forces present , 40 men from the paramilitary Israeli Border Police , used live ammunition on the Palestinians . They killed at least 21 . There were no Israeli deaths . <p> The Israeli Government claimed that the Palestinians brought the stones with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Temple Mount is a paved plain that usually has few if any stones . But at this time construction work did provide material for missiles . Zeev Schiff , the respected defense correspondent of the newspaper Haaretz , said the Palestinians began throwing stones only after mosques in the nearby village of Silwan announced through loudspeakers that Jewish extremists had come there . The extremists were from the Temple Mount Faithful , who proposed to rebuild Solomon 's Temple where the Al-Aqsa mosque now stands . <p> The Israeli supreme court had barred the Faithful from a proposed march to the Temple Mount itself . But the Palestinians may have been unaware of that , or doubtful that the court order would be obeyed . <p> But assume that the stone-throwing was a planned provocation . It was in any event outrageous . But in a civilized country that could not justify police use of live ammunition . <p> The official explanation was that the police had inadequate supplies of tear gas and rubber bullets , and acted in fear of their own lives . But why should Israel have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-trained Border Police , and without crowd-control weapons ? Why on a day when trouble could be expected ? Exactly a year ago the Temple Mount Faithful planned a demonstration , and Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem warned of a " catastrophe . " <p> Prime Minister Shamir , defending the police , said not a word of regret for the 21 dead . After all , they were only Palestinians . American Jewish leaders expressed no more regret . They were angry at the Bush Administration for criticizing Israel . Rabbi Marc D. Angel , president of the Rabbinical Council of America , said , " The U.S. has betrayed Israel . " <p> A sensible American Jewish leadership would have understood that this was an appalling failure of Israel 's vaunted intelligence . It would have criticized the Palestinians - but regretted the loss of human lives . It would have understood the danger of heightening the tension between Israel and the U.S. instead of trying to ease it . <p> Israel describes itself as a " strategic asset " of the United States . This episode showed how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States for its existence . For reasons of history and morality , we owe Israel that support . But we owe no support to policies that increase Israel 's isolation and injure American interests .
