<p> Although you may already have a long-distance carrier , experience has shown that it is necessary to stay informed about your plan because rates , services , and features are constantly changing . The plan you choose today might not meet your needs a few months from now and you may be missing out on a plan that could be saving you money . <p> Simply selecting a company is not enough , because most carriers have a number of different calling plans . Usually , each plan will be directed to a different calling pattern or usage level . As a result , it is the plan and not necessarily the company that is most important . <p> The first step in choosing a long-distance carrier is figuring out your calling pattern . Using three or four recent phone bills , chart the time of day and day of the week of your long-distance calls , the length ( in minutes ) of each call , and the total time ( in minutes ) of all of your calls . From this , you can determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your calls are made , where you call most often , and the average amount spent on these calls . <p> Once you know this calling pattern , you can see if you qualify for one of the many discount calling plans , or whether you can change your calling pattern to take advantage of these plans . <p> Subscribing to discount plans such as AT &T's; Reach Out America plans , MCI 's Prime Time plans , or Sprint 's Sprint Plus plans can result in significant savings over standard plans . To achieve maximum saving , however , you will typically have to make your calls during specified time periods or spend a minimum amount each month . If you decide to stay with a standard plan , you can still save money by making your calls during the night/weekend time period . <p> The table on page 20 illustrates how rates compare among six different calling patterns . Although your call patterns will differ , these comparisons should help you see where you might make some savings . <p> In addition to cost , you should consider services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling plans , credit for misdialed numbers , etc . The following plan descriptions list some major features , but you should contact the company directly for more information and up-to-date rate schedules . <p> Competition between long-distance companies is intense , resulting in frequent changes of rates and services . The information in the plan descriptions and in the table changes accordingly so that it was accurate and complete as of July 1992 . The Telecommunications Research &; Action Center ( TRAC ) , which compiled this information , will issue an update in March 1993 . For an update send $2 and a stamped , self-addressed envelope to TRAC , P.O.
