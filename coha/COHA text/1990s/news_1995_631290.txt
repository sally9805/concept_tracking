<p> As competition for jobs goes up and university costs rise , students are learning it 's more important than ever to make a wise selection of a graduate school . <p> Student Ricki Shine , for example , knows it 's important to be smart in choosing a school , even though she admits it was " serendipity " that led her to the American history program at Northwestern University , where she expects soon to earn a Ph.D . <p> " I knew a couple of things , " said the former Arizona attorney who now is a sixth-year graduate student . In a " gruesome " academic job market , " you need to go to the most prestigious place you can , if you want to get a job . " <p> And , she recounted , " I wanted to be in a city . " <p> Preparing to leave her law practice , Shine wrote away for catalogs from prestigious , city-based schools . She ruled out those whose American history programs required proficiency in two foreign languages . Seven programs remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nearly six years later , Shine acknowledged , " It was total serendipity . . . . It turned out to be a great thing for me , but it was n't because I did it the right way . " <p> Shine 's educated but uninformed approach is all too common , even among the brightest of students looking for academic graduate programs , said Ned Laff , an academic adviser at Weber State University in Ogden , Utah , and an independent counselor to Chicago area students . <p> " You can get ' killed ' if you go to the wrong program , " Laff said . " If it is not what you thought , you are in trouble . " <p> For some students , " trouble " means an unhappy and expensive first graduate school year , studying in one institution , looking for another place to transfer or , quite possibly , reinventing academic career goals . <p> To apply the " right way , " Shine suggested , " people should think about the things I did n't know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department , as well as the right institution , she said . <p> " When Northwestern offered me money , " Shine said , " I was like , ' Wow , this is cool . ' But it turns out that this is an important part of the whole process . " <p> Earning a Ph.D . can take anywhere from four years in the sciences to seven to 10 years in the humanities and the social sciences . During some of that time , graduate departments may subsidize all or part of student tuitions and living costs with outright fellowship grants , or in exchange for teaching or research assistance . <p> In some cases , well-endowed private institutions may be better able to offer assistance than seemingly low-cost public institutions . <p> If funding is guaranteed for only the first year , Shine said , uncertainty about each subsequent year 's decision " becomes competitive for the graduate students . <p> " If somebody else does better than me , it does n't mean money out of my pocket , " said Shine , who is " fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students need guidance when it comes to financial aid , said Northwestern 's graduate school associate dean Leila Edwards . <p> " A lot of students think fellowships are better than teaching assistantships , where you have to work , " Edwards said . " Not necessarily . I advise students against taking teaching assistantships and research assistantships in their first year . . . . After that , teaching assistantships , research assistantships get students into the department mainstream . <p> " A lot of graduate study is getting ideas , having conversations in the hall , getting into the department culture . Those who have multiyear fellowships can find themselves on the department fringe . They do n't have the same ways to interact with their colleagues . " <p> Besides financial aid , Shine continued , " You should know what subfield you want to go into . Figure out what you want to do , find out who the best people in the field are , and then apply to those programs . <p> " I applied to go into social history of the Revolution , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19th century U.S. legal and urban history . " Sometimes there really is n't an appropriate match in terms of an adviser . If you are interested in Tudor-Stuart England , for example , you do n't want a modern England expert . <p> " And , sometimes , " Shine added , " the best person in the field may not be the best person for you . " <p> Laff agreed . <p> " Say you decide you want to get a Ph.D . and actually teach in a university , " Laff said . " When you go to a graduate program , those faculty are admitting you with the belief that you are going to get involved in the intellectual endeavors in their field . You will be doing independent work , generating ideas for research . <p> " Right now , you are going to have to come out of graduate school with papers published , with papers presented , with courses taught . You are going to look like an assistant professor before you get out of graduate school . " <p> The task is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . <p> " It is critical for students in graduate school that they have good mentoring and advising all the way through the program , " Laff said . " You need to have a faculty mentor . " <p> How to find one ? <p> " I send my students to the most underused resource on every campus , the reference library , to read abstracts of research papers published in the professional journals in their fields . I tell them to find out who these people cite . Then you know who is influencing the field . <p> " Write these people letters , say , ' You are working in the area I want to study in . This is what I am up to . I would like to have the opportunity to study with you . ' <p> " A big-name school does not become a factor , " Laff said . Instead , " it is ' who can I study with , and where are these people . ' " <p> Another new resource for prospective students and for administrators is the NRC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , " the result of a four-year study that ranks and assesses 3,634 science and humanities programs at 274 of the nation 's 325 Ph.D. - granting public and private institutions . The study updates a similar 1982 report . <p> " It is a daunting task to grasp what that report is telling us , " said Northwestern 's Edwards . <p> But , she added , " for students approaching the report from a particular academic perspective , " trying to assess anthropology departments , for example , " it 's a smaller , not quite so overwhelming task . <p> Smaller , but essential , she added . <p> A student considering undergraduate education looks at the reputation of an entire institution , Edwards explained . " At the graduate level , " however , " you are not really picking an institution so much as a department , and sometimes they are at unexpected places . <p> " The ( NRC ) ratings help us find where those foremost departments are . " <p> But reports have their limits . <p> " Do not just pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the graduate college and vice chancellor for research at the University of Illinois at Chicago . <p> " Pick up the phone . Call the college , make an appointment with the faculty , talk with them , share with them what you want to do with your life , what you want to accomplish . They can direct you . " <p> Edwards agreed . " Visit , visit , visit , " she said . <p> " It can be a prestigious department , and be hell on wheels . The chemistry has got to work , " she added . " Students should look for a good match between their interests and some number of faculty in the department . " <p> Even after the phone calls and the visits , some of the questions most important to students may remain unasked , said Lois Stein , dean of students in the University of Chicago 's social sciences division . <p> " They do n't ask always what is the average time to degree , how long does the program take , what are the components of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field work . <p> " Another question that ought to be asked is how does financial aid work . Is it one-year , multiyear , merit- or need-based ? <p> " What do your graduates do after graduation ? How many get teaching positions ? To be frank , it is a question that universities are asking ourselves . <p> " Six to eight years ago , people felt opportunities in higher education were going to open up in a significant way . We have sort of revised that rosy vision , nationally . <p> " A student is taking somewhat of a calculated risk , " Stein said . " A student feels that he or she will be successful , and feels a strong commitment to the discipline . That is what pulls them to graduate school . " <p> That is also what appears to have propelled Ricki Shine through her program . The academic job market is " just gruesome , " she acknowledged , adding quickly , " I am hopeful . Teaching is very important to me . " <p> Others share her optimism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic employment , students continue to be drawn to academic graduate programs , said Knox College associate dean Stephen Bailey . <p> " We are certainly trying to be candid with them , " Bailey said . <p> Still , 43 percent of Knox graduates went on to academic graduate education in 1994 compared with 26 percent in 1992 , an increase , Bailey said , " so large as to make me take in my breath . " Some 60 percent of Knox students who go to graduate school enroll directly after completing their undergraduate degrees . <p> Baily urges Knox students to travel from Galesburg to prospective graduate schools , to " talk to the faculty . . . even to the secretaries of the departments . . . to find out ' what cooks . ' <p> " Faculty tend to be very straightforward , " Bailey said . " They have no need to make a special case for their programs . " <p> After the visits , students head to graduate school for a variety of reasons , Bailey observed . In an otherwise uncertain economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " When you are excited about learning , the logical next step is to go into graduate school , " observed Jason Cody , who this August completed his Ph.D . in inorganic chemistry at Northwestern University . <p> " When you do n't have a clear next step , your default position can be graduate school . That can be wonderful or it can be a nightmare . " <p> There is also , for many , the appeal of an eventual career as an academic . <p> " Teaching is a career that not too many people leave , " Bailey noted . " A lot of teachers get a lot of gratification from their work , and students see that . Not like lawyers . " <p> Getting started , even with a completed Ph.D. , can be difficult . <p> Shortly after returning from a meeting of graduate deans early this fall , Loyola University-Chicago 's James F. Brennan noted , " The responsibility of institutions in placing their students is a subject we are talking about , a hot issue and very important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pared down , " Brennan observed . " We have n't gotten rid of any , but some are getting very close . " <p> Meanwhile , he noted , " doctoral credentials are becoming an almost common credential , even to teach in community colleges , and many ( teachers ) have them in high school . <p> Although the big-growth profit areas for colleges are " lifetime learning " master 's degree programs , Brennan said , academic graduate students remain essential to the institutions . <p> " We simply could n't run the place without them . We value the talent they bring to education and to the research program . "
