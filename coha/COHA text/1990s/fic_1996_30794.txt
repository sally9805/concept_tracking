In Haddam , summer floats over tree-softened streets like a sweet lotion balm from a careless , languorous god , and the world falls in tune with its own mysterious anthems . Shaded lawns lie still and damp in the early a.m . Outside , on peaceful-morning Cleveland Street , I hear the footfalls of a lone jogger , tramping past and down the hill toward Taft Lane and across to the Choir College , there to run in the damp grass . In the Negro trace , men sit on stoops , pants legs rolled above their sock tops , sipping coffee in the growing , easeful heat . The marriage enrichment class ( 4 to 6 ) has let out at the high school , its members sleepy-eyed and dazed , bound for bed again . While on the green gridiron pallet our varsity band begins its two-a-day drills , revving up for the 4th : " Boom-Haddam , boom-Haddam , boom-boom-ba-boom . Haddam-Haddam , up'n-at-'em ! Boom-boom-ba-boom ! " Elsewhere up the seaboard the sky , I know , reads hazy . The heat closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already the first clouds of a summer T-storm lurk on the mountain horizons , and it 's hotter where they live than where we live . Far out on the main line the breeze is right to hear the Amtrak , " The Merchants ' special , " hurtle past for Philly . And along on the same breeze , a sea-salt smell floats in from miles and miles away , mingling with shadowy rhododendron aromas and the last of the summer 's staunch azaleas . Though back on my street , the first shaded block of Cleveland , sweet silence reigns . A block away , someone patiently bounces a driveway ball : squeak ... then breathing ... then a laugh , a cough ... " All riiight , that 's the waaay . " None of it too loud . In front of the Zumbros ' , two doors down , the streets crew is finishing a quiet smoke before cranking their machines and unsettling the dust again . We 're repaving this summer , putting in a new " line , " resodding the neutral ground , setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Cape Verdeans and wily Hondurans from poorer towns north of here . Sergeantsville and Little York . They sit and stare silently beside their yellow front-loaders , ground flatteners and backhoes , their sleek private cars -- Camaros and Chevy low-riders -- parked around the corner , away from the dust and where it will be shady later on . And suddenly the carillon at St. Leo the Great begins : gong , gong , gong , gong , gong , gong , then a sweet , bright admonitory matinal air by old Wesley himself : " Wake the day , ye who would be saved , wake the day , let your souls be laved . " Though all is not exactly kosher here , in spite of a good beginning . ( When is anything exactly kosher ? ) I myself , Frank Bascombe , was mugged on Coolidge Street , one street over , late in April , spiritedly legging it home from a closing at our realty office just at dusk , a sense of achievement lightening my step , still hoping to catch the evening news , a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bundle for -- under my arm . Three young boys , one of whom I thought I 'd seen before -- an Asian -- yet could n't later name , came careering ziggy-zaggy down the sidewalk on minibikes , conked me in the head with a giant Pepsi bottle , and rode off howling . Nothing was stolen or broken , though I was knocked silly on the ground , and sat in the grass for ten minutes , unnoticed in a whirling daze . Later , in early May , the Zumbros ' house and one other were burgled twice in the same week ( they missed some things the first time and came back to get them ) . And then , to all our bewilderment , Clair Devane , our one black agent , a woman I was briefly but intensely " linked with " two years ago , was murdered in May inside a condo she was showing out the Great Woods Road , near Hightstown : roped and tied , raped and stabbed . No good clues left -- just a pink while-you-were-out slip lying in the parquet entry , the message in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started looking . Mid-90's. 3 p.m . Get key . Dinner with Eddie . " Eddie was her fiance . Plus , falling property values now ride through the trees like an odorless , colorless mist settling through the still air where all breathe it in , all sense it , though our new amenities -- the new police cruisers , the new crosswalks , the trimmed tree branches , the buried electric , the refurbished band shell , the plans for the 4th of July parade -- do what they civically can to ease our minds off worrying , convince us our worries are n't worries , or at least not ours alone but everyone's -- no one's -- and that staying the course , holding the line , riding the cyclical nature of things are what this country 's all about , and thinking otherwise is to drive optimism into retreat , to be paranoid and in need of expensive " treatment " out-of-state . And practically speaking , while bearing in mind that one event rarely causes another in a simple way , it must mean something to a town ' to the local esprit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Why else would real estate prices be an index to the national wellbeing ? ) If , for instance , some otherwise healthy charcoal briquette firm 's stock took a nosedive , the company would react ASAP . Its " people " would stay at their desks an extra hour past dark ( unless they were fired outright ) ; men would go home more dog-tired than usual , carrying no flowers , would stand longer in the violet evening hours staring up at the tree limbs in need of trimming , would talk less kindly to their kids , would opt for an extra Pimm 's before dinner alone with the wife , then wake oddly at four with nothing much , but nothing good , in mind . Just restless . And so it is in Haddam , where all around , our summer swoon notwithstanding , there 's a new sense of a wild world being just beyond our perimeter , an untalked apprehension among our residents , one I believe they 'll never get used to , one they 'll die before accommodating . A sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see the very things you 'll never adapt to coming toward you on the horizon . You see them as the problems they are , you worry like hell about them , you make provisions , take precautions , fashion adjustments ; you tell yourself you 'll have to change your way of doing things . Only you do n't . You ca n't . Somehow it 's already too late . And maybe it 's even worse than that : maybe the thing you see coming from far away is not the real thing , the thing that scares you , but its aftermath . And what you 've feared will happen has already taken place . This is similar in spirit to the realization that all the great new advances of medical science will have no benefit for us at all , though we cheer them on , hope a vaccine might be ready in time , think things could still get better . Only it 's too late there too . And in that very way our life gets over before we know it . We miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways we miss our lives are life . " This morning I am up early , in my upstairs office under the eaves , going over a listing logged in as an " Exclusive " just at closing last night , and for which I may already have willing buyers later today . Listings frequently appear in this unexpected , providential way : An owner belts back a few Manhattans , takes an afternoon trip around the yard to police up bits of paper blown from the neighbors ' garbage , rakes the last of the winter 's damp , fecund leaves from under the forsythia beneath which lies buried his old Dalmatian , Pepper , makes a close inspection of the hemlocks he and his wife planted as a hedge when they were young marrieds long ago , takes a nostalgic walk back through rooms he 's painted , baths grouted far past midnight , along the way has two more stiff ones followed hard by a sudden great welling and suppressed heart 's cry for a long-lost life we must all ( if we care to go on living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes more he 's on the phone , interrupting some realtor from a quiet dinner at home , and in ten more minutes the whole deed 's done . It 's progress of a sort . ( By lucky coincidence , my clients the Joe Markhams will have driven down from Vermont this very night , and conceivably I could complete the circuit -- listing to sale -- in a single day 's time . The record , not mine , is four minutes . ) My other duty this early morning involves writing the editorial for our firm 's monthly " Buyer vs . Seller " guide ( sent free to every breathing freeholder on the Haddam tax rolls ) . This month I 'm fine-tuning my thoughts on the likely real estate fallout from the approaching Democratic Convention , when the uninspirational Governor Dukakis , spirit-genius of the sinister Massachusetts Miracle , will grab the prize , then roll on to victory in November -- my personal hope , but a prospect that paralyzes most Haddam property owners with fear , since they 're almost all Republicans , love Reagan like Catholics love the Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle of Vice President Bush as their new leader . My arguing tack departs from Emerson 's famous line in Self-Reliance , " To be great is to be misunderstood , " which I 've trigged into a thesis that claims Governor Dukakis has in mind more " pure pocketbook issues " than most voters think ; that economic insecurity is a plus for the Democrats ; and that interest rates , on the skids all year , will hit 11% by New Year 's no matter if William Jennings Bryan is elected President and the silver standard reinstituted . ( These sentiments also scare Republicans to death . ) " So what the hell , " is the essence of my clincher , " things could get worse in a hurry . Now 's the time to test the realty waters . Sell ! ( or Buy ) . " In these summery days my own life , at least frontally , is simplicity 's model . I live happily if slightly bemusedly in a forty-four-year-old bachelor 's way in my former wife 's house at 116 Cleveland , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey , where I 'm employed as a Realtor Associate by the Lauren-Schwindell firm on Seminary Street . I should say , perhaps , the house formerly owned by formerly my wife , Ann Dykstra , now Mrs. Charley O'Dell of 86 Swallow Lane , Deep River , CT . Both my children live there too , though I 'm not certain how happy they are or even should be . The configuration of life events that led me to this profession and to this very house could , I suppose , seem unusual if your model for human continuance is some Middletown white paper from early in the century and geared to Indiana , or an " ideal American family life " profile as promoted by some right-wing think tank -- several of whose directors live here in Haddam -- but that are just propaganda for a mode of life no one could live without access to the very impulse-suppressing , nostalgia-provoking drugs they do n't want you to have ( though I 'm sure they have them by the tractor-trailer loads ) . But to anyone reasonable , my life will seem more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us escapes and which do little harm in an existence that otherwise goes unnoticed . This morning , however , I 'm setting off on a weekend trip with my only son , which promises , unlike most of my seekings , to be starred by weighty life events . There is , in fact , an odd feeling of lasts to this excursion , as if some signal period in life -- mine and his -- is coming , if not to a full close , then at least toward some tightening , transforming twist in the kaleidoscope , a change I 'd be foolish to take lightly and do n't . ( The impulse to read Self-Reliance is significant here , as is the holiday itself -- my favorite secular one for being public and for its implicit goal of leaving us only as it found us : free . ) All of this comes -- in surfeit -- near the anniversary of my divorce , a time when I routinely feel broody and insubstantial , and spend days puzzling over that summer seven years ago , when life swerved badly and I , somehow at a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that I 'm off this afternoon , south to South Mantoloking , on the Jersey Shore , for my usual Friday evening rendezvous with my lady friend ( there are n't any politer or better words , finally ) , blond , tall and leggy Sally Caldwell . Though even here trouble may be brewing . For ten months now , Sally and I have carried on what 's seemed to me a perfect " your place and mine " romance , affording each other generous portions of companionship , confidence ( on an as-needed basis ) , within-reason reliability and plenty of spicy , untranscendent transport -- all with ample " space " allotted and the complete presumption of laissez-faire ( which I do n't have much use for ) , while remaining fully respectful of the high-priced lessons and vividly catalogued mistakes of adulthood . Not love , it 's true . Not exactly . But closer to love than the puny goods most married folks dole out . And yet in the last weeks , for reasons I ca n't explain , what I can only call a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way to our usually stirring lovemaking and even to the frequency of our visits ; as if the hold we keep on the other 's attentions and affections is changing and loosening , and it 's now our business to form a new grip , for a longer , more serious attachment -- only neither of us has yet proved quite able , and we are perplexed by the failure . Last night , sometime after midnight , when I 'd already slept for an hour , waked up twice twisting my pillow and fretting about Paul 's and my journey , downed a glass of milk , watched the Weather Channel , then settled back to read a chapter of The Declaration of Independence -- Carl Becker 's classic , which , along with Self-Reliance , I plan to use as key " texts " for communicating with my troubled son and thereby transmitting to him important info -- Sally called . ( These volumes by the way are n't a bit grinding , stuffy or boring , the way they seemed in school , but are brimming with useful , insightful lessons applicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Hi , hi . What 's new ? " she said , a tone of uneasy restraint in her usually silky voice , as if midnight calls were not our regular practice , which they are n't . " I was just reading Carl Becker , who 's terrific , " I said , though on alert . " He thought that the whole Declaration of Independence was an attempt to prove rebellion was the wrong word for what the founding fathers were up to . It was a war over a word choice . That 's pretty amazing . " She sighed . " What was the right word ? " " Oh . Common sense . Nature . Progress . God 's will . Karma . Nirvana . It pretty much all meant the same thing to Jefferson and Adams and those guys . They were smarter than we are . " " I thought it was more important than that , " she said . Then she said , " Life seems congested to me . Just suddenly tonight . Does it to you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no idea how to translate them . Possibly , I thought , this was an opening gambit to an announcement that she never wanted to see me again -- which has happened . ( " Congested " being used in its secondary meaning as : " unbearable . " ) " Something 's crying out to be noticed , I just do n't know what it is , " she said . " But it must have to do with you and I. Do n't you agree ? " " Well . Maybe , " I said . " I do n't know . " I was propped up by my bed lamp , under my favorite framed map of Block Island , the musty old annotated Becker on my chest , the window fan ( I 've opted for no air-conditioning ) drawing cool , sweet suburban midnight onto my bedcovers . Nothing I could think of was missing right then , besides sleep . " I just feel things are congested and I 'm missing something , " Sally said again . " Are you sure you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some things to have others . " This was an idiotic answer . I felt I might possibly be asleep but tomorrow still have a hard time convincing myself this conversation had n't happened -- which is also not that infrequent with me . " I had a dream tonight , " Sally said . " We were in your house in Haddam , and you kept neatening everything up . I was your wife somehow , but I felt terrible anxiety . There was blue water in our toilet bowl , and at some point you and I shook hands , standing on your front steps -- just like you 'd sold me your own house . And then I saw you shooting away out across the middle of a big cornfield with your arms stretched out like Christ or something , just like back in Illinois . " Where she 's from , the stolid , Christian corn belt . " It was peaceful in a way . But the whole effect was that everything was very , very busy and hectic and no one could get anything done right . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke up and I wanted to call you . " " I 'm glad you did , " I said . " It does n't sound like anything that bad , though . You were n't being chased by wild animals who looked like me , or getting pushed out of airplanes . " " No , " she said , and seemed to consider those fates . Far away in the night I could hear a train . " Except I felt so anxious . It was very vivid . I do n't usually have vivid dreams . " " I try to forget my dreams . " " I know . You 're very proud of it . " " No I 'm not . But they do n't ever seem mysterious enough . I 'd remember them if they seemed very interesting . Tonight I dreamed I was reading , and I was reading . " " You do n't seem too engaged . Maybe now is n't a good time to talk seriously . " She sounded embarrassed , as if I was making fun of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear your voice , though , " I said , thinking she was right . It was the middle of the night . Little good begins then . " I 'm sorry I got you up . " " You did n't get me up . " At this point , though , and unbeknownst to her , I turned out my light and lay breathing , listening to the train in the cool dark . " You just want something you 're not getting , is my guess . It 's not unusual . " In Sally 's case , it could be any one of a number of things . " Do n't you ever feel that way ? " " No . I feel like I have a lot as it is . I have you . " That 's very nice , " she said , not so warmly . " It is nice . " " I guess I 'll be seeing you tomorrow , wo n't I ? " " You bet . I 'll be there with bells on . " " Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dream . " " I will . I wo n't . " And I put the phone down . It would be untruthful to pretend that what Sally was wrestling with last night was some want or absence I did n't feel myself . And perhaps I 'm simply a poor bet for her or anybody , since I so like the tintinnabulation of early romance yet lack the urge to do more than ignore it when that sweet sonority threatens to develop into something else . A successful practice of my middle life , a time I think of as the Existence Period , has been to ignore much of what I do n't like or that seems worrisome and embroiling , and then usually see it go away . But I 'm as aware of " things " as Sally is , and imagine this may be the first signal ( or possibly it 's the thirty-seventh ) that we might soon no longer " see " each other . And I feel regret , would like to find a way of reviving things . Only , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go as they go and see what happens . Perhaps they 'll even get better . It 's as possible as not . The matter of greater magnitude and utmost importance , though , involves my son , Paul Bascombe , who is fifteen . Two and a half months ago , just after tax time and six weeks before his school year ended in Deep River , he was arrested for shoplifting three boxes of 4X condoms ( " Magnums " ) from a display-dispenser in the Finast down in Essex . His acts were surveilled by an " eye in the sky " camera hidden above the male hygiene products . And when a tiny though uniformed Vietnamese security person ( a female ) approached him just beyond the checkout , where as a diversionary tactic he 'd bought a bottle of Grecian Formula , he bolted but was wrestled to the ground , whereupon he screamed that the woman was " a goddamned spick asshole , " kicked her in the thigh , hit her in the mouth ( conceivably by accident ) and pulled out a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the help of a pharmacist and another customer get the cuffs on him . ( His mother had him out in an hour . ) The security guard naturally enough has pressed criminal charges of assault and battery , as well as for the violation of some of her civil rights , and there have even been " hate crime " and " making an example " rumblings out of the Essex juvenile authorities . ( I consider this only as election-year bluster plus community rivalry . ) Meanwhile , Paul has been through myriad pretrial interviews , plus hours of tangled psychological evaluations of his personality , attitudes and mental state -- two of which sessions I attended , found unremarkable but fair , though I have not yet seen the results . For these proceedings he has had not a lawyer but an " ombudsman , " who 's a social worker trained in legal matters , and who his mother has talked to but I have n't . His first actual court date is to be this Tuesday morning , the day after the 4th of July . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me he feels not very guilty , that the woman rushed him from behind and scared the shit out of him so that he thought he might be being murdered and needed to defend himself ; that he should n't have said what he said , that it was a mistake , but he 's promised he has nothing against any other races or genders and in fact feels " betrayed " himself -- by what , he has n't said . He 's claimed to have had no specific use in mind for the condoms ( a relief if true ) and probably would 've used them only in a practical joke against Charley O'Dell , his mother 's husband , whom he , along with his father , dislikes . For a brief time I thought of taking a leave from the realty office , sub-letting a condo somewhere down the road from Deep River and keeping in touch with Paul on a daily basis . But his mother disapproved . She did n't want me around , and said so . She also believed that unless things got worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hearing . She and I have continued to talk it over every bit -- Haddam to Deep River -- and she is of the belief that all this will pass , that he is simply going through a phase and does n't , in fact , have a syndrome or a mania , as someone might think . ( It is her Michigan stoicism that allows her to equate endurance with progress . ) But as a result , I 've seen less of him than I 'd like in the last two months , though I have now proposed bringing him down to Haddam to live with me in the fall , which Ann has so far been leery of . She has , however -- because she is n't crazy -- hauled him to New Haven to be " privately evaluated " by a fancy shrink , an experience Paul claims he enjoyed and lied through like a pirate . Ann even went so far as to send him for twelve days in mid-May to an expensive health camp in the Berkshires , Camp Wanapi ( called " Camp Unhappy " by the inmates ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore encouraged to wear mime makeup and spend part of every day sitting in an invisible chair with an invisible pane of glass in front of him , smiling and looking surprised and grimacing at passersby . ( This was , of course , also videotaped . ) The camp counselors , who were all secretly " milieu therapists " in mufti -- loose white tee-shirts , baggy khaki shorts , muscle-bound calves , dog whistles , lanyards , clipboards , preternaturally geared up for unstructured heart-to-hearts expressed the opinion that Paul was intellectually beyond his years ( language and reasoning skills off the Stanford charts ) but was emotionally underdeveloped ( closer to age twelve ) , which in their view posed " a problem . " So that even though he acts and talks like a shrewd sophomore in the honors program at Beloit , full of sly jokes and double entendres ( he has also recently shot up to 5 ' 8 " , with a new layer of quaky pudge all over ) , his feelings still get hurt in the manner of a child who knows much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camp Unhappy , he has also begun exhibiting an unusual number of unusual symptoms : he has complained about an inability to yawn and sneeze properly ; he has remarked about a mysterious " tingling " at the end of his penis ; he has complained about not liking how his teeth " line up . " And he has from time to time made unexpected barking noises -- leering like a Cheshire , afterwards -- and for several days made soft but audible eeeck-eeecking sounds by drawing breath back down his throat with his mouth closed , usually with a look of dismay on his face . His mother has tried to talk to him about this , has re-consulted the shrink ( who 's advised many more sessions ) , and has even gotten Charley to " step in . " Paul at first claimed he could n't imagine what anybody was talking about , that all seemed normal to him , then later he said that making noises satisfied a legitimate inner urge and did n't bother others , and that they should get over their problems with it , and him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence , to increase my own ombudsman 's involvement , conducting early-morning phone conversations with him ( one of which I 'm awaiting hopefully this morning ) and taking him and now and then his sister , Clarissa , on fishing trips to the Red Man Club , an exclusive anglers ' hideaway I joined for this very purpose . I have also taken him once to Atlantic City on a boys-only junket to see Mel Torme at TropWorld , and twice to Sally 's seashore house , there to be idle-hours bums , swimming in the ocean when syringes and solid human waste were n't competing for room , walking the beach and talking over affairs of the world and himself in a nondirected way until way after dark . In these talks , Paul has revealed much : most notably , that he 's waging a complex but losing struggle to forget certain things . He remembers , for instance , a dog we had years ago when we were all a nuclear family together in Haddam , a sweet , wiggly , old basset hound named Mr. Toby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doted on like candy , but who got flattened late one summer afternoon right in front of our house during a family cookout . Poor Mr. Toby actually clambered up off the Hoving Road pavement and in a dying dash galumphed straight to Paul and leaped into his arms before shuddering , wailing once and croaking . Paul has told me in these last weeks that even then ( at only age six ) he was afraid the incident would stay in his mind , possibly even for the rest of his life , and ruin it . For weeks and weeks , he said , he lay awake in his room thinking about Mr. Toby and worrying about the fact that he was thinking about it . Though eventually the memory had gone away , until just after the Finast rubber incident , when it came back , and now he thinks about Mr. Toby " a lot " ( possibly constantly ) , thinks that Mr. Toby should be alive still and we should have him -- and by extension , of course , that his poor brother , Ralph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as he surely should ) and we should all still be we . There are even ways , he 's said , in which all this is not that unpleasant to think about , since he remembers much of that early time , before bad things happened , as having been " fun . " And in that sense , his is a rare species of nostalgia . He has also told me that as of recently he has begun to picture the thinking process , and that his seems to be made of " concentric rings , " bright like hula hoops , one of which is memory , and that he tries but ca n't make them all " fit down flush on top of each other " in the congruent way he thinks they should -- except sometimes just before the precise moment of sleep , when he can briefly forget about everything and feel happy . He has likewise told me about what he refers to as " thinking he 's thinking , " by which he tries to maintain continuous monitorship of all his thoughts as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore making life better ( though by doing so , of course , he threatens to drive himself nuts ) . In a way his " problem " is simple : he has become compelled to figure out life and how to live it far too early , long before he 's seen a sufficient number of unfixable crises cruise past him like damaged boats and realized that fixing one in six is a damn good average and the rest you have to let go -- a useful coping skill of the Existence Period . All this is not a good recipe , I know . In fact , it 's a bad recipe : a formula for a life stifled by ironies and disappointments , as one little outer character tries to make friends with or exert control over another , submerged , one , but ca n't . ( He could end up as an academic , or a U.N . translator . ) Plus , he 's left-handed and so is already threatened by earlier-than-usual loss of life , by greater chances of being blinded by flying objects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs , hit by cars piloted by other left-handers , of deciding to live in the Third World , of not getting the ball over the plate consistently and of being divorced like his Dad and Mom . My fatherly job , needless to say , is not at all easy at this enforced distance of miles : to coax by some middleman 's charm his two foreign selves , his present and his childish past , into a better , more robust and outward-tending relationship -- like separate , angry nations seeking one government -- and to sponsor self-tolerance as a theme for the future . This , of course , is what any father should do in any life , and I have tried , despite the impediments of divorce and time and not always knowing my adversary . Only it seems plain to me now , and as Ann believes , I have not been completely successful . But bright and early tomorrow I am picking him up all the way in Connecticut and staging for both our benefits a split-the-breeze father-and-son driving campaign in which we will visit as many sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( this being only two ) , winding up in storied Cooperstown , where we 'll stay in the venerable Deerslayer Inn , fish on scenic Lake Otsego , shoot off safe and ethical fireworks , eat like castaways , and somehow along the way I 'll work ( I hope ) the miracle only a father can work . Which is to say : if your son begins suddenly to fall at a headlong rate , you must through the agency of love and greater age throw him a line and haul him back . ( All this somehow before delivering him to his mother in NYC and getting myself back here to Haddam , where I myself , for reasons of familiarity , am best off on the 4th of July. )
