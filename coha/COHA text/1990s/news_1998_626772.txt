<p> GOODNIGHT - It takes big words to describe the Palo Duro Canyon , to express the surprise you feel when , after traveling mile upon monotonous mile across the board-flat Texas Panhandle plains , the green wheat fields suddenly end and the earth cracks open 800 feet deep and six miles wide . <p> For 10,000 years , this land of blood-red buttes and shadowed valleys provided shelter for nomadic tribes and great , rumbling herds of bison . For more than a century , it has been a home for cattle - and for mythic cattlemen like Charles Goodnight , who tamed the region for settlers in the late 19th century . <p> Goodnight , whose exploits as a cattle breeder and trail driver inspired Larry McMurtry 's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Lonesome Dove , already was a star of the West when he began building his massive ranch in the 1870s . <p> Now , for the first time in 60 years , 55,000 acres of Goodnight 's ranch - including much of the Palo Duro and Mulberry canyons - are up for sale . Asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acre . <p> " Is that too much to ask for a ranch ? " says Ed Morris , an Amarillo lawyer and vice president of Goodnight Ranch and Cattle Co. , the family corporation that owns the land in Armstrong and Briscoe counties . " Yes it is - if you 're using it for a ranching operation that has to make money . " <p> But Morris and his family are banking on beauty . <p> Finding a buyer not easy <p> And even though Goodnight , a cunning , capitalist curmudgeon , paid as little as 75 cents an acre , and recent sales of adjoining ranch land have brought $ 75 an acre , the sellers believe such a glorious parcel of God 's country is a bargain at any price . <p> Goodnight Ranch and Cattle is trolling for buyers among rich lawyers and doctors or gentlemen-rancher businessmen . The property has been placed with a Dallas real estate firm tied to the prestigious Sotheby 's auction house . Advertisements have run in The New York Times . <p> The listing has fueled hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers . <p> Larry Scruggs , director of Palo Duro Canyon State Park , which has shared the canyon with the ranch since the 1930s , said the state has no plans to bid for the property . Still , he fretted , ecologically unsound development of the land might harm the entire region . <p> Robert Potts , director of the San Antonio-based Texas Nature Conservancy , which has established 35 preserves in the state , said his group also would pass on the ranch . But , he said , his organization is actively working to find a deep-pocketed nature lover to acquire the land . <p> " I think it would be perfect for Ted Turner to buy it , " opined novelist McMurtry . " He has the buffalo . It would only seem logical . This is where the buffalo were . " <p> McMurtry even has gone so far as to make that suggestion to Brian Smith , the Dallas real estate agent handling the property . Smith said Sotheby 's plans to approach Turner about the ranch . <p> The Atlanta television mogul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffalo , was traveling last week and unavailable for comment . <p> As much as anything , Morris said , his family is " testing the waters " by putting the ranch on the market . Family members are opposed to dividing the land into smaller parcels . If it can not be sold on acceptable terms within the next year or two , he said , the ranch likely will be pulled from the market . <p> The old Goodnight property consists of a 42,175-acre tract on the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River and a second , 13,385-acre tract on Mulberry Creek that includes Goodnight 's century-old ranch home . The ranch also includes three other houses , assorted support buildings , 17 windmills and 25 stock tanks . <p> Goodnight Ranch has been in Morris ' family since his grandmother , Mattie Whittenburg Hedgecoke , daughter of a Hutchinson County rancher and wife of an Amarillo merchant , purchased it in the late 1930s . <p> " She loved the land , " Morris said , " and I believe - I 've been told by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas development in Hutchinson County had so afflicted the landscape . Her desire was to have a place untouched by civilization . At that time , portions of the old ranch were up for sale . She bought them . <p> " At that time , someone asked her if she would allow exploration on her land . She answered , ' No , I 'm afraid they might find some . " ' <p> After her death , five test wells were drilled on the land . No oil was found . <p> Morris said it was " a hard decision " to put the property up for sale . <p> " We 're still not 100 percent comfortable with the sale , " he said . " But over the years , the heirs have grown apart . Some have moved out of Amarillo . . . and we have found that with someone who does not live in Amarillo , it 's difficult to derive much satisfaction out of owning a ranch . <p> " The economic return from leasing it for grass is modest . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patterson , chief Armstrong County tax appraiser and a fifth-generation ranch country resident , observed that the situation of Mattie Hedgecoke 's descendants is not unique . <p> " You just ca n't make any money off a ranch , " he said . As families grow and scatter , he added , " it 's difficult to keep pride in the old homestead . " <p> In recent years , ranch land increasingly has been bought by out-of-town professionals willing to pay up to $ 400 an acre . <p> Recent arrivals <p> Among recent arrivals is ranch-reared Amarillo optometrist Anthony Bass , who revels in the region 's history and beauty and loves to tinker with an old ranch wagon he 's rebuilding . <p> Many longtime ranchers , though , are blase about the romance that intrigues newcomers like Bass , Patterson said . The sale or breakup of old ranches is viewed pragmatically . <p> Goodnight , McMurtry suggested , would have shared such a view . <p> " I think he would have understood that very much , " the novelist said . " People die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond anybody 's affecting very much . I do n't romanticize it myself . " <p> Tale of a cattle king <p> Born in 1836 in Illinois , Goodnight was a bearded , blunt-spoken wheeler-dealer who , by middle-age had built and lost a cattle empire in Colorado , blazed the Goodnight-Loving Trail and earned a reputation as a skilled breeder of superior livestock . In Texas , he prided himself on the skill with which he amassed a " crazy quilt " pattern of prime land in the Palo Duro . <p> Under his shrewd management , the JA Ranch , co-owned by Irish financier John Adair , soon became one of the region 's premier spreads . At its height in the mid-1880s , it encompassed 1.3 million acres and boasted 100,000 cattle . <p> To Goodnight , the canyon was , in essence , an appealing enclosure for cattle , safe from the brutal winter winds that blasted the plains . Its steep walls were natural fences . <p> Paradoxically , Goodnight , who once herded 15,000 buffalo to the far reaches of the Palo Duro to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaggy beasts . Late in life , he cultivated herds of bison , breeding them with Angus cattle to produce " cattalo , " and invited old Native American acquaintances to the ranch for hunts . <p> The breakup of his partnership with Adair in the 1890s began a series of business reversals , including the ill-advised backing of a Mexican silver mining operation that decimated his finances . <p> " He was always bothered that he was outwitted and out-lawyered , " McMurtry said . <p> By the time he died landless in 1929 at age 93 , Goodnight was a revered , if reluctant , remnant of a passing era . <p> " I reckon I 've been shot at and missed more times than any man living but I would n't say so because nobody would believe me and I would n't blame them , " Goodnight noted shortly before his death . " There is so much hot air about the pioneer days , it 's a nuisance to be a frontiersman . " <p> Morris , who has never lived on the ranch , is emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . He fondly remembers hunting and hiking excursions and oldtime Fourth of July picnics in the canyon . <p> " I have sat on a wind-blasted mountain peak in that area and felt it was a unique place , " he said . " I 've seen a lot of the world . Germany . Vietnam . But Palo Duro has an unequaled beauty of its own . The colors of the soil . The effects of the light . <p> " Anyone who has spent time there exploring its farthest reaches - I do n't mean a cursory view from the road - definitely knows the emotional hold . For those who have not done that , the opposite is true . <p> " For those who are not emotionally attached , it 's an investment with an unfavorable rate of return . "
