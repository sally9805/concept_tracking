The world is full of important stories ; the trick is finding fresh and compelling ways to tell them . It often helps to think big : to commit lots of talent , time and space to the effort . That 's what we did last year when TIME sought to explore the mood of late-century America by sending a team of journalists rolling from town to town and coast to coast along U.S. Highway 50 . This week we take a similar high-impact approach to the vital subject of healing , in a 36-page special report on a week in the life of one of the nation 's premier teaching hospitals . That institution , Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina , agreed to play host to 14 of our journalists , who examined everything from the effects of managed care and advances in medical research to the role of religion in patients ' recovery . <P> On call 24 hours a day and equipped with hospital pagers , the team was directed and its work edited by Barrett Seaman , our special-projects editor . Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staked out the infant intensive-care unit . Adam Cohen , a staff writer , checked out Duke 's marketing strategy . Senior writer David Van Biema 's beeper alerted him whenever a patient was feared to be dying . Deputy photo editor Rick Boeth marshaled the photographers chronicling the action . Veteran science correspondent Dick Thompson and senior reporter Alice Park " knew what the doctors were talking about , which made them translators for the rest of us , " says Seaman . <P> Observes Gibbs : " Reporting on Washington , we always think we 're dealing with life-or-death situations . This experience restored my perspective and balance . "
