On the eve of the American Revolution , Boston was a sleepy port city ringed by farming communities and held under British territorial control ( as were the rest of the American colonies ) . Patriots in Boston felt especially uneasy in April 1775 , because rumors were flying that the British would crack down hard and raid the colonists ' supplies and munitions . The rumors proved true . Silversmith , printer , patriot , and able horseman Paul Revere took it upon himself to warn the people in the countryside of the impending disaster . But the British soon captured him . Did the Moon play a role in Revere 's dramatic performance and ultimate capture ? According to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 's " The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere , " it did . A local marker between Lexington and Concord that commemorates Revere 's ride and capture yields additional clues about the Moon 's role on that historic night . Now we can gain further insights into the night 's events by recreating the sky with a modern computer program . Taken together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time to a night two hundred and seventeen years ago . To set the stage for the night 's events , let 's look at the strategy of the British and what that strategy has to do with Longfellow 's memorable line " one , if by land , and two , if by sea . " The colonists had hidden a cache or supplies in a small barn in a little town called Concord . At the time , the British troops occupying Boston under the command of General Thomas Gage were somewhat restricted in their movements . Boston then was connected to the mainland by a small neck of land . ( The inlet in that neck , Back Bay , has long since been filled in and buildings constructed on the filled area . ) During revolutionary days , only two routes connected Boston with the mainland , either by road along the neck ( " by land " ) or across the Charles River estuary ( " by sea " ) . The British probably considered the raid on Concord to be a routine operation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route and the time . Moving by the land route to Concord meant a longer march ( about four extra miles , which would take an extra hour ) . Moving by sea required a delicate amphibious operation : ferrying about 700 troops across a tidal river was indeed no easy task . Because secrecy was essential , it would have to be done at night . Revere apparently suspected the British would choose the route by sea . On Sunday , April 16 , he observed that smallboats were launched from H.M.S. Somerset , a British man-of-war moored in the Charles River . Although uncertain about the route , Revere logically presumed that Gage 's infantry would set off at night , and he made arrangements accordingly with his friend , Colonel Conant , and other gentlemen . If the British went by water , Revere later wrote , " We should shew two lanthorns in the North Church steeple , and if by land , one as a signal , for we were apprehensive it would be difficult to cross the Charles River , or to git over Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 18th , Dr. Joseph Warren , a patriot and well-known citizen , heard that the British troops were leaving their barracks , so he sent for Revere and William Dawes , Jr . Dawes was to ride to Lexington over the Boston neck while Revere would go over the shorter route through Charlestown . At about 10:30 p.m. , two friends ferried Revere across the Charles a little east of where the Somerset lay . Dawes , who had ridden the longer route , eventually caught up with Revere . The two were then joined by Dr. Samuel Prescott , a rider who was returning to his Concord home from Lexington . About 1.3 miles west of Lexington , two British officers surprised the group . Luckily for them , Dawes and Prescott were riding about 200 yards behind Revere and they escaped . But Revere was not so lucky . As he tried to bolt his horse toward a wooded area , he was confronted by six British soldiers who grabbed his bridle , aimed pistols at his chest , and forced him to dismount . Unfortunately for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lechmere Point in Cambridge , many disgruntled King 's soldiers were waiting for provisions to be secured and divided . What should have been a surprise raid was doomed from the start , because Dawes and Prescott 's warning gave the patriots ample time to get ready for the confrontation . Before the day was over , 73 British were killed , 174 wounded , and 26 missing  --  a casualty rate of 16 percent of the 1,700 deployed . The casualties were considerably smaller for the estimated 3,500 colonial militia troops who took part in the fighting . Now , what role did the Moon play on that fateful night and how precise was Longfellow in his telling of the story ? According to the Voyager computer program , the Moon was Full three days before Revere 's ride . This meant that a bright , gibbous Moon would be shining down on the action below . The British troops would not have to march in pitch darkness , but neither would they or Revere have the cover of complete darkness . As Revere and his friends made their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have known that they would pass close to the Somerset for they muffled their oarlocks ( with a petticoat , history tells us ) . As we read in Longfellow 's poetic account of Revere 's exploits , Then he said , " Good night ! " and with muffled oar Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore , Just as the moon rose over the bay . Does Longfellow 's poem accurately reflect the skies over Boston at this juncture ? A skyplot made with the Voyager program shows that on April 18 the Moon rose in Boston at 9:36 p.m. local time . ( Throughout this article , we shall assume that Boston local time is the same as Eastern Standard Time . ) Longfellow was right on the money . The moonlight undoubtedly made it easier for the troops to negotiate the countryside . It also made it easier for the thin screen of horsemen that General Gage had laid out all the way to Concord to spot any suspicious movements . The marker tells a slightly different story than either Longfellow or Voyager , however . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two o'clock of the morning of April 19 , 1775 , the night being clear and the Moon in its third quarter . " Based on the distance of Revere 's travel , this time seems reasonable , but the Moon 's phase is at best an approximation . Using Jean Meeus ' Astronomical Formulae for Calculators , it 's easy to find that the Moon 's phase was 0.87 on April 18 , 1775 , at midnight local time ( April 19 at about 5h universal time ) . Voyager confirmed that when Revere was halted by the British , the Moon was fairly high in the sky , on the way to its transit at 2:42 a.m. and shining at magnitude - 12.8 , thus providing ample light . A perpetual calendar tells us that the Moon was 18 days old on that famous evening . This modern analysis raises a slight problem , as the marker commemorating the arrest clearly describes a Moon at " third quarter . " But an 18-day-old , 87-percent-lit Moon appears significantly different than a Third Quarter Moon . Perhaps the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broad term to signify a Moon well past Full but not yet a crescent . Are there any other references to the Moon 's phase on this historic night ? There is in Longfellow 's image of the Somerset lying at her mooring in the Charles River : A phantom ship , with each mast and spar , Across the moon like a prison bar , And a huge black hull , that was magnified By its own reflection in the tide . This suggests a bright Moon  --  full or gibbous but certainly not third quarter  --  although the detail is the poet 's invention since Revere passed east of the ship . ( Incidentally , had Revere observed the ship , he would have seen it from a distance of several hundred yards  --  not enough to see a " huge black hull magnified by its own reflection . " ) Longfellow 's image of the ship " swinging wide at her moorings " is no romantic fancy , however . A computer program made available to merchant seamen by the French Service Hydrographique et Oceanographique de la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high tide did occur in the Bay of Boston shortly before midnight . The British grenadiers and light infantry started embarking on the Back Bay from Boston Common at about 10:30 p.m. , with the rising tide . The smallboats and barges were heavily loaded . For that reason , they could not be run in close to land and the troops had to wade ashore . We can safely assume that the tidal height would have determined how close to shore the boats could come . Whether the height of the tide directly influenced the time the troops crossed or landed is not clear . It 's impossible to determine by examining the area today how low the tidal basin would have been at the time of landing . The Moon was at perigee about 4 days later , which supposes a fairly wide amplitude for the tide of April 18 . In those days , however , predicting tidal height on a definite day was mainly guesswork . Though General Gage certainly would have known ahead of time when high tide would occur , it 's unlikely he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local tides and how high they would be . We commonly remake history . Had it been darker and had the tide been more favorable that night , the face of the world might have changed . Recreating the astronomical conditions on that famous night allows us to make a fascinating journey into our country 's past . Assessing the real importance of these conditions on the unrolling tide of the events is quite another story . Suppose we took the matter differently and date the event from the astronomical data found in Longfellow 's poem ? Then Paul Revere 's ride took place a few days after the Full Moon  --  to account for its rising in midevening and being bright enough so the ship 's reflection could be seen  --  at most a day or two before the actual date . If , on the other hand , we accept the evidence for the Moon 's phase from the marker , then the patriot set off on his midnight ride three or four days after the actual date . This shows how cautious we must be when dating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paul Revere 's ride is a nice example of how art and science can complement each other to give us a deeper and more rewarding picture of important historical events . Alone , they tell us only par of the story . <p>                     @x With every generation , it seems , a new demographic panic strikes Israel . Opening the Israeli Knesset ( parliament ) on October 8 , 2007 , after the Jewish New Year , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert warned of " a demographic battle , drowned in blood and tears , " if Israel did not make territorial concessions. n1 As a new administration in Washington seeks to revive the peace process , the demographic question has again moved front and center . Citing Israel 's eroding demographic position , New York Times columnist Roger Cohen urged Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton to try " tough love " to force Israeli concessions. n2 Proponents of the argument that demography mandates concessions might be sincere , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show an imminent Jewish minority in Israel , but even a cursory look at Palestinian numbers shows just how false and politically motivated recent Palestinian surveys are . <p> On February 9 , 2008 , Luay Shabaneh , the new president of the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics ( PCBS ) , published the results of a December 2007 Palestinian Authority population census. n3 According to the new data , since 1997 , the Arab population has increased to 1,460,000 in the Gaza Strip and 2,300,000 in the West Bank ( including 208,000 in East Jerusalem ) to a total of 3,760,000 people -- an increase of 30 percent in one decade . East Jerusalem is under Israel 's administration , but the Palestinian Authority nevertheless counts its Arab population as part of the territory it administers . Thus , the East Jerusalem Arabs are double-counted : once as part of the Arab population of Israel , and again as a part of the population of the Palestinian Authority . <p> The 30 percent population increase again caused renewed demographic panic in Israel . According to a BBC news report , Israeli prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution with the Palestinians would bring the end of the State of Israel. ( n4 ) <p> But unlike what had happened during previous demographic panics , Israeli experts began to raise serious questions about the accuracy of the census . Such questions had been a long time in coming : Most of the middle- and long-term demographic forecasts for Israel , the West Bank , and the Gaza Strip -- formulated by demographers over the last 110 years -- have turned out to be unsound , often dramatically so . This is due to the fact that long-term military , political , economic , and social changes in the region particularly , and in the world in general , can not be accurately predicted ; what is presented with a patina of scientific legitimacy is often simply someone 's best guess . Added to this problem is a more troublesome one : Population statistics and birth rates play such an important role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- from the way that foreign aid is allocated to Israel 's decision to hold or relinquish territory -- that those attempting to manipulate the perceptions of both the public and policymakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned the new Palestinian census were correct : The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics ' demographic data arrived at its data not through objective scientific inquiry but rather by overstating the size of the Arab population residing in the territories administered by the Palestinian Authority . <p> L : THE HISTORY OF DEMOGRAPHIC FORECASTS In a March 1898 letter , the famous Jewish historian , Simon Dubnow , criticized Zionist ideas , writing , <p> During seventeen years of tense work to encourage substantial emigration , after the expense of vast means and with the help of millions donated by Rothschild , we managed to place on the land of Palestine only about 3,600 settlers , which makes up approximately 211 people per year . Let us allow that the Western Zionist committees will work with significantly larger capitals and energy and will move to Palestine not two hundred , but one thousand settlers annually ... then in a hundred years the Jewish population of Palestine will reach one hundred thousand men . Let 's increase this number five times and add to this the natural increase and inflow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a half million Jews in Palestine after one hundred years ... Certainly , all of us treasure the hope to see at the beginning of the twenty-first century about a half-million of our brothers living in our ancient homeland , but can it solve the problem of 10 millions Jews , who are dispersed ? ( n5 ) <p> In May 1948 , only fifty years after Dubnow 's projections , the Jews in Palestine already numbered 649,600 people . <p> Such mistaken projections , however , have been the rule rather than the exception . At the end of 1944 , Roberto Bachi presented to the Jewish National Council , the main institution of the Jewish community during the British Mandate , a secret demographic report n6 that included four forecasts : optimistic and pessimistic , and with Jewish immigration as a variable . Bachi based his forecasts on the existing demographic data for 1938-42 and on estimates of trends that could be accepted as reasonable . He assumed that Arab fertility for the ensuing sixty years would continue to be very high ( seven children or more per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six children per woman ) . He also assumed that Jewish fertility would remain at about two children per woman but might increase slightly to three children per woman . He also predicted that Jewish immigration might bring about one million Jews to Israel during the five to fifteen years starting from 1946. ( n7 ) <p> These estimates could not be treated as prophecy , wrote Bachi , since the differences between reality and forecast increase as the projected time period lengthens . According to Bachi 's pessimistic scenario , by 1971 , the population of Palestine would include 2,467,000 Arabs and 604,000 Jews without Jewish immigration n8 or 1,695,000 Jews should there have been one million Jewish immigrants. n9 According to Bachi 's more optimistic forecasts , the population of Palestine in the same year could consist of 2,186,000 Arabs and 698,000 Jews without immigration or 1,898,000 Jews with a million Jewish immigrants . <p> Fast-forward to 1971 . Israel controlled the whole territory of the former British Mandate in Palestine , and 2,662,000 Jews already lived in Israel -- about half a million more than in Bachi 's most optimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one million fewer than he had predicted . Then in 1972 , Bachi predicted , as he had in 1956 , n11 that immigration to Israel would stop as the Jews of the West were indifferent and the Jews of the Soviet Union were forever trapped. n12 Nevertheless , over the next seven years , more than a quarter million Jews migrated to Israel . <p> His projections for 2001 were similarly off-base : According to the pessimistic forecast , the population of Palestine in 2001 would comprise 5,871,000 Arabs and 563,000 Jews without immigration or 1,580,000 Jews with a million Jewish immigrants . Following his optimistic forecast , the population of Palestine in 2001 should have been 4,415,000 Arabs and 831,000 Jews without immigration or 2,258,000 Jews with a million Jewish immigrants . <p> The reality was quite different . The Jewish population reached 5,025,010 , nine times more than his pessimistic projection , and 2.2 times more than his most optimistic forecast . When combined with the immigrant population from the former Soviet Union , the total comprised 5,281,300 people. n13 The total Arab population reached 3,570,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projection for 2001 . <p> Israel 's Central Bureau of Statistics forecast in 1968 that , by 1985 , the Jewish population would increase to 2,923,000 , and the Arab population would rise to 49 percent of Israel 's total population. n14 In reality , there were 3,517,200 Jews in 1985 , representing 62.7 percent of the total population . <p> Amidst the 1987 Palestinian uprising against Israeli control in the West Bank and Gaza , demographic predictions-no matter how sloppy -- became the stuff of headlines . In 1987 , the Israeli newspaper Yedi'ot Aharanot quoted Arnon Sofer 's bombshell forecast : " In the year 2000 , Israel will become non-Jewish . " n15 The New York Times ' Thomas Friedman picked up Sofer 's prediction and ran with it in an 1800-word , page one story. n16 Sofer claimed that by 2000 there would be " 4.2 million Jews versus 3.5 million non-Jews . The 3.5 million Arabs would include : 1.2 million Israeli Arabs within the Green Line , one million Arabs in the Gaza Strip , and between 1.1 and 1.5 million in the West Bank . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 2.1 to 2.5 million Arabs in the Palestinian territories . <p> Putting aside the fact that the figures did not justify the headlines proclaiming a Jewish minority , Sofer actually miscalculated the Arab population twice : First , by using the 1986 Central Bureau of Statistics forecast made for 2002 for all Arabs -- defined officially as citizens and permanent residents of the State of Israel , including East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights -- as the Arab population of Israel only " within the Green Line , " i.e. , exclusive of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights ; and , second , by folding the Arab population of East Jerusalem into the forecast of the Arab population in the Palestinian territories . Then , he presented the forecast for the West Bank and Gaza Strip including East Jerusalem , as it was usually done by the U.N. , CIA , and Palestinian sources . In effect , this results in double counting the East Jerusalem population , first as permanent residents of the State of Israel and then as the residents of Palestinian territory . <p> A month later , Sofer explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make up one percentage point today , we need an additional 170,000 Jews ... Who among us really expects that sort of aliya ( migration to Israel ) in the near future ? " n18 Two years later , though , just such a migration occurred , underlining the inability of the demographers to forecast political developments . Over the ensuing decade , more than one million Jews were repatriated to Israel from the former Soviet Union . Including mixed Jewish families , this wave of immigration totaled 1.2 million people and increased Israel 's Jewish population by 31 percent . Demographic prediction is such an uncertain science that even Israeli specialists get it wrong repeatedly . <p> L : A DEMOGRAPHIC INTIFADA Palestinian Arab numbers have always been spotty . There is very little historical data . As University of Illinois economics professor Fred M. Gottheil has noted , <p> Palestinian demography of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries has never been just a matter of numbers . It has always been -- and consciously so -- a frontline weapon used in a life-and-death struggle for nationhood ... The problem with staking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the data generated by demographers and others since the early nineteenth century are so lacking in precision that , in some matters of dispute concerning demography , " anyone 's guess , " as the saying goes , " is as good as any other . " ( n19 ) <p> Justin McCarthy , a University of Louisville historian with a specialization in demography , notes that Israel 's 1967 census of Gaza 's population was the first in more than thirty-five years ; before that census , procedures were not rigorous . At best , McCarthy notes , pre-1967 counts of Palestinian Arabs are " estimations " although he also notes that subsequent Israeli-conducted censuses were scientific and objective. ( n20 ) <p> In 1997 , three years after the Oslo accords handed control of large portions of the West Bank and Gaza to the Palestine Authority , the Palestinians conducted their first independent census , according to which the Arab population numbered 2,895,683 people : 1,873,476 in the West Bank ( including 210,209 in East Jerusalem ) and 1,022,207 in the Gaza Strip. n21 It also included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only permanent residents in the population registry. n22 According to the " U.N . Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses , " people to be enumerated by the census are defined as " usual residents " : <p> Usual residents may have citizenship or not , and they may also include undocumented persons , applicants for asylum , or refugees . Usual residents then may include foreigners who reside , or intend to reside , in the country continuously for either most of the last 12 months or for 12 months or more , depending on the definition of place of usual residence that is adopted by the country . Persons who may consider themselves usual residents of a country because of citizenship or family ties , but are absent from the country for either most of the last 12 months , or for 12 months or more , depending on the definition adopted , should be excluded. ( n23 ) <p> Even without contesting the professionalism of the count itself , the Arab population stood , in fact , at only 2,360,231 people when the East Jerusalem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics themselves seem improbably high . According to data released by the Israeli census bureau at the end of 1993 , the Arab population numbered 1,084,400 in the West Bank and 748,400 in the Gaza Strip , for a total of 1,832,800. n24 If the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics census was accurate , the Arab population in the Palestinian territories increased by an astonishing 527,431 people , or 29 percent , in only four years . In order to reach such phenomenal population growth , the geometrical mean of the annual growth rate would have to be an improbable 6.6 percent per year during this period . <p> U.N . data for 2006 indicate that the natural growth of the Arab population in the West Bank and Gaza Strip was much smaller : an annual average of 3.89 percent per year between 1990 and 1995 , 3.7 percent between 1995 and 2000 , and 3.56 percent per year between 2000 and 2005. n25 Even these U.N . estimates may be high , as they accepted Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics data uncritically . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Palestinian population grew by about one million people from 1990 to 2000. n26 By coincidence , this figure seemingly offsets the mass immigration to Israel from the former Soviet Union during the 1990s . The study found that Palestinian data suggested that the Arab population had doubled and that the Palestinian Arab population nominal growth was actually larger than the Jewish population growth at the time of the migration of Soviet Jews to Israel . Given the strain and management problem that a population growth of 31.2 percent represented for Israel , it defies logic that Palestinian growth could double without outside observers noticing . As McCarthy noted , <p> It is difficult to see how the agricultural or industrial base of Palestine can cope with the increased numbers that will result from high Palestinian fertility ... Possessing neither the agricultural potential nor the economic base ... Palestine can expect a demographic crisis. ( n27 ) <p> This study prompted Haggai Segal , an Israel-based Ma'ariv , Makor Rishon , and BeSheva columnist , journalist , and commentator , to undertake additional investigation on this subject , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American and Israeli demography team headed by Bennett Zimmerman and Yoram Ettinger confirmed the 2003 findings and again criticized both the illegitimate inclusion of Arab emigrants from the Palestinian Authority and the double counting of the East Jerusalem Arab population. n29 The Zimmerman and Ettinger study also revealed that , at the end of 2000 , the Arab population in the West Bank and Gaza Strip numbered 2,246,000 people -- 1,280,000 in the West Bank and about 966,000 in the Gaza Strip . <p> According to the data provided by the Palestinian Authority at the end of 2005 , in contrast , the population in the territories numbered 3,762,005 -- 2,372,216 in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , and 1,389,789 in the Gaza Strip. n30 The Palestinian numbers get even stranger : According to estimates by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics , in 2006 , the population of the Palestinian Authority jumped to 3,952,354 ( n31 )  - -  an increase of 190,349 over the previous year , or more than 5 percent in a single year . Not only is this improbable but , according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.4 percent in 2003 , 2.6 percent in 2004 , and 2.5 percent in 2005. ( n32 ) <p> In February 2005 , the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics released a study conducted by Yousef Ibrahim , a professor of geography and population studies at al-Aqsa University in Gaza , which said that the Arab population would reach 6.3 million in 2010 , compared to 5.7 million Jews , provided that the current growth ratios continued along the same pattern n33 consciously utilizing the words of Israeli demographic expert Sergio DellaPergola , who said that " the direction is quite obvious . Before the end of this decade , Jews will become a minority in the lands that include ' Israel , ' West Bank and Gaza Strip . " n34 The Atlantic , a widely read American monthly , asked shrilly , " Will Israel Live to 100 ? " ( n35 ) <p> Then , in December 2006 , the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics issued a statement asserting that a " population dichotomy at 5.7 million is expected at the end of 2010 , " i.e. , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of the Jews , n36 a discrepancy of 600,000 in less than two years . <p> In February 2008 , the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistic , using data from the Palestinian Authority 's December 2007 census , n37 found that the population of the Palestinian Authority reached 3,760,000 people : 1,460,000 in the Gaza Strip and 2,300,000 in the West Bank , including 208,000 in East Jerusalem , an increase of 30 percent from 1997 . But , according to these data , the population in East Jerusalem is 2,209 less than it was in 1997 . This report provoked harsh criticism from the Palestinian Authority , which demanded that these " distortions " be " corrected . " n38 Hatem Abdel Kader , an adviser on Jerusalem affairs to Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayyad , said he did not believe the Jerusalem figures were reliable and that the Palestinian Authority believed that census takers had failed to visit many households. ( n39 ) <p> Once again , by coincidence , the results of the population census for the end of 2007 were almost identical to the estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happened to the 192,354 people that existed according to the estimates of the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics at the end of 2006 ? Two answers are possible : During 2007 , there was a massive emigration of Arabs from the Palestinian territories , unprecedented since the Six-Day War , and the results were registered in the population census ; or this was a crude manipulation of the data and estimates of the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics , especially the gaps in their data for 2005 and 2006 . The latter is more plausible . As Hassan Abu Libdeh , director of the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics in the 1990s , told The New York Times , " In my opinion , the data is as important as the intifada . It is a civil intifada . " n40 Indeed , such an attitude explains why the Palestinian Authority 's Ministry of Health has erased from their Internet site official reports containing demographic data since 2000 , which might contradict the Palestinian leadership 's current line . <p> The 2007 census clearly shows that the yearly growth rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual geometric mean over the last ten years , should have been 2.66 percent . By extending this 10-year period to fourteen years , and basing calculations on the data of the Israeli census bureau for the population of the Palestinian territories for the end of 1993 , the population of these areas should , in fact , stand at 2,646,871 -- 1,113,129 fewer than the 2007 Palestinian census . The difference between the likely actual Palestinian population and the results of the two Palestinian censuses ( 1997 and 2007 ) is probably around one million people , just as the Zimmerman and Ettinger study showed four years ago . The major data distortion was made in 1997 , and then the overstated population number became the basis for the future estimates . <p> L : CONCLUSIONS On May 15 , 2008 , Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics president Luay Shabaneh claimed that the Arab population in Palestine would become equal to the Jewish population by 2016 , n41 echoing similar predictions of an impending Jewish minority by earlier generations of demographers and analysts : Bachi in 1944 , n42 Patrick Loftus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinkhas Sapir in 1973 , n45 Sofer in 1987 , n46 DellaPergola in 2005 , and the Palestinian bureau in 2005 and 2006 . <p> Then , three months after this last Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics statement , DellaPergola once again postponed his previous projection of Arab and Jewish population reaching equality from 2010 to 2020. n47 From DellaPergola 's statement , it seems that the gap of one million persons could be closed in ten years , making necessary an additional annual yearly increase of 100,000 Arabs , more than double the current numbers . But , far from doubling , Arab fertility and natural increase are decreasing following the demographic transition rules . <p> Why fudge the numbers ? There are two important reasons : First , overstating the Palestinian population is good for Palestinian morale , bad for Israeli morale , and heightens Jewish fears of the so-called " demographic time bomb " ; second , there is a significant financial incentive , as the international community provides money to the Palestinian Authority according to the number of its inhabitants . When the Palestinian Authority pads its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Careful demographic analysis , however , should lead to a conclusion in stark contrast to the demographic time bomb thesis . The natural increase of the Jewish population in Israel -- that is , its yearly birth rate less its yearly death rate -- stabilized thirty years ago and , since 2002 , has even begun to grow . The natural increase of the total Arab population , comprising both Israeli Arabs and the Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza , continues to descend toward convergence with the Jewish population , probably in the latter half of this century . <p> The data , moreover , point to rising levels of Arab emigration , particularly among young people . According to the survey conducted by Bir-Zeit University , 32 percent of all Palestinians and 44 percent of Palestinian youth would emigrate if they could. n48 The official Palestinian newspaper Al-Hayat al-Jadida has reported similar numbers. n49 A public opinion poll conducted by the Near East Consulting Corporation in the Gaza Strip reveals an even higher rate -- 47 percent of all Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. n50 Translated into numbers of people , as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories wish to emigrate . As journalist Amit Cohen noted in 2007 , " Close to 14,000 Palestinians , more than 1 percent of the population in the Strip , have left the Gaza Strip since the implementation of the withdrawal program , " n51 largely for financial reasons. ( n52 ) <p> In an interview reported in the pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat around the same time , Salam Fayyad , head of the Emergency Palestinian Government , commented : " How will we be able to deal with the problem of 40,000 to 50,000 Palestinians who have emigrated and many more that are not emigrating just because they do not have the means ?
