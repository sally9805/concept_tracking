As Congress wrapped up its business last week , effusive farewells were given for Senators and Congressmen who will not be returning to Capitol Hill . Some kudos fell a little flat . Congressman Bill Dannemeyer , improbably lauded as " the conscience of the House , " will long be remembered for inserting into the 1989 Congressional Record a description of homosexual lovemaking so meanspirited that it was later excised from the permanent text . Senator Steve Symms , praised for bravely defending the rights of gun owners , is notable for little else . Senator Alan Dixon was lionized as " one of the most fiercely independent Democrats " in Congress . Funny . He is noted for being so chummy with lobbyists that he is known around the Hill as " Al the Pal . "
