<p> BOSTON In the film , German doctors are preparing the shaved heads of gay men for surgery . The doctors paint black marks on the men 's skulls to guide their drills to the part of the brain they believe is the source of homosexuality . <p> The scene sends a chill through this audience a largely gay and lesbian crowd here at Harvard Medical School for a weekend conference on the nature of homosexuality . <p> The German experiments stopped two decades ago . But those here medical students , faculty members , mental health professionals , gay activists and others fear that the current burst of interest in the biological aspects of homosexuality may have a dangerous side . <p> If homosexuality is found to be a largely biological phenomenon an increasingly popular view it will no doubt be seen by some as a physical illness in need of a cure , just as it was once seen by psychiatrists as a mental illness in need of therapy . <p> Despite these fears , researchers many gay themselves continue the search for answers sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search began in earnest with the work of Alfred Kinsey in the 1940s and 1950s . Kinsey 's surveys found that a sizable minority of men and women from all walks of life reported some sexual contact with others of their own sex ; a small percentage , more men than women , were exclusively homosexual . <p> " If you had asked somebody in 1945 , ' What do you know about gay people ? Where are they ? ' people would have said , ' Oh , there are probably some in Paris , Greenwich Village , maybe in prison , ' " says Dr. Richard Pillard , a Boston University psychiatrist and researcher . <p> Kinsey 's report made it clear that homosexuals were everywhere in society . Just how many people are homosexual continues to be a matter of debate . Kinsey said 10% of men were predominantly homosexual ; most recent estimates put the number lower . Pillard says his experience suggests about 4% of men and 2% to 3% of women are exclusively homosexual . <p> Whatever the number , the question remains : Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on biology . <p> Pillard , who is gay , decided in the 1980s to see if homosexuality ran in families . " I 'm interested , " he says , " because homosexuality runs in my family . " <p> His hunch paid off . He looked at 50 straight men and 50 gay men and found that the gay men had significantly more gay brothers . <p> Even more striking were the results of studies he did with J. Michael Bailey , a psychologist at Northwestern University in Chicago . They found that 52% of the identical twins of gay men were gay themselves ; 22% of gay men 's fraternal twin brothers and other biological brothers were gay and 10% of their adopted brothers were gay . <p> Similar results now are being found in lesbians . <p> Anecdotal evidence suggests even identical twins raised apart show uncanny similarities in sexual orientation . Pillard tells the story of two middle-aged men who learned they were twin brothers when " they were mistaken for one another in a gay bar . " <p> The inescapable conclusion : Homosexuality has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only important factors ; if they were , every identical twin brother of a gay man would be gay as well . <p> Also , there is evidence to suggest the same genes are not involved in male and female homosexuality . The sibling studies show gay men are n't particularly likely to have lesbian sisters . <p> And it 's a mistake to think there is a " gay gene , " says Dean Hamer , a geneticist at the National Cancer Institute . Sexual orientation is probably due to multiple genetic factors interacting with multiple environmental factors , he says . <p> That should comfort those , he says , who worry that prenatal testing might someday be used to identify " gay " fetuses for abortion purposes : " We 'll never have that sort of knowledge , " he says . At most , he says , " we might be able to tell someone that instead of a 2% chance , there 's an 8% chance " the child would be homosexual . <p> The key genes , he says , could influence how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality is expressed in very young children . <p> Environmental factors , other researchers say , can include prebirth events . <p> " There are plenty of things going on between conception and birth that are environmental , " says Simon LeVay , head of the Institute of Gay and Lesbian Studies in West Hollywood , Calif . One theory , for instance , is that stress in the mother can cause hormonal disruptions that affect the fetus ' sexual development . <p> " Not everything that 's non-genetic has to be Freudian , " LeVay says , referring to now-discredited theories that homosexuality is essentially a product of the parent/child relationship . <p> LeVay is best known for his recent finding of brain differences between gay and straight men . In autopsy studies , he found that a region of the brain within the hypothalamus a center of sexual appetite and other basic drives is smaller in gay men than it is in heterosexual men . <p> LeVay says the brain difference is n't necessarily the cause of homosexuality , but adds to evidence that gay people are different in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute researcher , a gay man who lost a lover to AIDS and proudly calls himself a gay activist , thinks it 's important to get such information to those who believe homosexuality is a lifestyle choice . <p> " The knowledge can be used for good as well as evil , " says LeVay , who showed the film in which German scientists tried to alter gay men through brain surgery . In another film segment , he showed an interview with a newspaper editor who started supporting gay rights after seeing the evidence for biological causes . <p> " There are a lot of people who 've been taught that homosexuality is wrong , but can be persuaded ( otherwise ) by science , " LeVay says . <p> However , he says , " Science by itself is not going to change the world . You 're not going to get gay rights through any amount of research on the hypothalamus . " <p> And , says April Martin , a lesbian psychotherapist in New York , that 's the way it should be : " The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights and social acceptance ( has ) nothing whatsoever to do with whether we can or ca n't help or change our inclination . <p> " It has nothing to do with whether we were born this way or whether we evolved into our own creation . It has to do with the fact that it is morally wrong to oppress people based on characteristics or behavior which cause no harm to anything except the established social hierarchy . " <p> Dr. Michael Forstein , a Harvard psychiatrist , agrees : " Why should people choosing to love somebody be treated differently than someone with a biological basis for that choice ? "
