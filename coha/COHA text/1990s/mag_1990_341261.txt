For all its first-class expertise and glorious achievement in space technology , the U.S. has had more than a fair share of bad luck , not to say tragedy . Now the quality of that vaunted technology has become a serious question . Last week , in a period of just a few days , NASA discovered that its $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope had been fitted with a faulty mirror and that a second of its three shuttles had sprung hydrogen leaks . <P> Costly and frustrating as the shuttle problem is , NASA will be able to correct it with relative ease . The agency prudently grounded not only the two faulty spaceships but the third shuttle as well , until engineers are satisfied that the hydrogen fuel system is safe . This means a wholesale rescheduling of NASA 's launch program and corresponding delays in realizing all of NASA 's scientific and military objectives . <P> The Hubble difficulty is quite something else . Unlike the shuttle , the telescope is unique . Moreover , it has already been launched and can not be hauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was launched in April , NASA promised that it would see the ancient universe in startling clarity , but the discovery that one of the two mirrors that form the heart of its optics had been incorrectly manufactured served mainly to focus attention on the limits of high technology . The immediate result is that for all Hubble 's tremendous cost , two of its most heralded advantages  --  the ability to distinguish very close objects and the knack for detecting faint light from the early universe  --  are lost . Said John Logsdon , director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University : " It 's horrible . " <P> The visible starlight that Hubble is now able to collect and magnify is no better than that seen by landlocked observatories . It is impossible for Hubble to find a planet circling a distant star or detect a black hole at the center of a galaxy . At least 40% of the experiments planned for the telescope will have to be postponed until engineers can make lenses for the craft 's instruments that will compensate for the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuttle into orbit and space walk to the telescope , where they will fit the new lenses . And getting those spectacles to Hubble may take three to six years . <P> Hubble never had an easy time . After the launch , engineers had to fiddle with stubborn antennas that refused to extend . When the antennas were fixed , the messages that came back to Earth indicated that the spacecraft was wobbling : when it swung from darkness to sunlight , the sun 's rays striking Hubble 's cold solar panels produced a minor vibration that caused the spacecraft to oscillate slowly . This motion confused instruments that were built to such precision that they could read a license plate 48 km ( 30 miles ) away . NASA software designers are now writing programs to counteract the oscillations so that the telescope tube can be held steady . <P> Locating objects for the telescope has also been bothersome . An exhaustive catalog of guide stars was built into Hubble 's computer memory , enabling it to identify both its position in space and the object of its interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information properly , and for weeks Hubble was looking left when it should have been looking right . That too has been fixed with a software Band-Aid .
