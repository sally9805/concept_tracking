Sepulveda Boulevard would lead her to the cornfields and crows of Scripture , a field guilied by rainfall , and parking lots where men sat in cars smoking . Sometimes they got out of their cars and went to the bathroom in a cement barrack . This action scared her back to creation . Rows of electric lights burned white in the daylight under a plastic tent . A model airplane buzzed across the field , but she was forbidden entrance to that nature preserve because she walked with a dog . Encircled by mountains , the valley was a catcher for fog . Early mist dreamed over the dam . Brittle twigs screened her view . Berries bled blue but were gray with dew , too . Two bodies had lain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego Freeway . Yellow canvas covered them and she flinched to avoid a blue raindrop heading for her eye . Police lights were on the way . She had noticed earlier that angels , like mourning doves , coo to a Pyrrhic meter . Later she would take the bread-soaked square in wine from an Eastern Orthodox priest and pray for these bodies . But that night she continues on past the end of their lives to the recycling center with her daily bag of cans . <p> Everything 's a Fake Caiote scruff in canyons off , Mulholland Drive . Fragrance of sage and rosemary , now it s spring . At night the mockingbirds ring their warnings of cats coming across the neighborhoods . Like castanets in the palms of a dancer , the palm trees clack . The HOOLYWOOD sign has a white skin of fog across it where erotic canyons hump , moisten , slide , dry up , swell , and shift . They appear impatient  --  to make such powerful contact with pleasure that they will toss back the entire cover of earth . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low branches of bay and acacia . Bitter flowers will catch her eye : pink and thin honeysuckle , or mock orange . They coat the branches like lace in the back of a mystical store . Other deviant men and women live at the base of these canyons , closer to the city , however . Her mouth is often dry , her chest tight , but she is filled to the brim with excess idolatry . It was like a flat mouse  --  the whole of Los Angeles she could hold in the circle formed by her thumb and forefinger . Tires were planted to stop the flow of mud at her feet . But she could see all the way to Long Beach through a tunnel made in her fist . Her quest for the perfect place was only a symptom of the same infection that was out there , a mild one , but a symptom nonetheless . <p> There Are No " Others " Outside the plant they walked hurriedly , she a few paces behind him , her voice raw and loud . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , invisible in a mashed potatoish heap of cottons and quilts . The man was dressed entirely in black , wore a tight black net on his hair , sweated lightly through his dewy black skin . Her bleached yellow hair expressed no cowardice , but rage , so they both ( because together ) suffered all the way from the plant to the car . " What kind of girl is this  --  an empty shell ? a lonely cell in which an empty soul must dwell ? " Colors are identified with the state of the spirit . The Regency Arms , for example , were red in welcoming her every night , both as anarchist arms and as sexual arms . Red lips on a tropical neon sign read REAL LIVE NUDES . Mini-malls held gourmet shops along Sunset Boulevard . Her talk all the way to the click of the car door was really a scream . Why was he taking it so passively ? others wondered watching . But in such a case there are no answers adequate outside of " jailbait . " Dogs piss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of script reading JESUS COSMOS . It was the Sabbath when all things begin anew , and all things are considered equal , and when , as in dreams , the new and the equal know no evil . <p> Jailbait A trough inside the Pacific Ocean led to an onshore flow . Then high seas , large swells , and a small-craft advisor . One storm system was weaker than the one before , and so did nothing to shift around the ozone , carbon monoxide , nitrogen dioxide , or the pre-menstrual syndrome in women 's bodies . From the Southland mountains into the valley , clouds pumped out shadows and rainbows . Palm leaves played on invisible keys , and the only children on the streets of Hollywood were lost children . Just as jazz makes white wine chill on a balcony , so black stockings make syringes look like silver , and nostril rings resemble Disney tattoos . Shelter couches have rough skins and are not welcoming . Leather gloves , rip-hemmed jeans , sneakers , and Benadryl , all for sale . Kiss my casket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been given antibiotics against an outbreak of meningitis . One individual lay on a mattress in an unlighted cell , listening . It had to be a detour he was experiencing . He had hoped for notoriety when the means of his survival were found in obscurity . When he had begun performing actions that he knew were expected of him , he had already begun to lose his way . Now protected by darkness that his interior met with lighted , colorized dream stories , he could live without gas or refrigeration . He had come to this condition without even making a choice . It was rather as if someone had stuck up a sign on the lonely highway , and he had obeyed it , although it turned out to have been a joke intended for someone else to laugh about . <p> You Ca n't Warm Your Hands in Front of a Book But You Can Warm Your Hopes There Feathers fluffed the ashtray bin at the bottom of the elevator . Feathers and a smeared black look littered the parking lot like mascara . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the other cars on La Brea . It looked as if a struggle had ended in tears between the bird and an enemy . She broke through the fear to examine it . No chicken daws , or comb , no wing no egg . The neutrality of words like " nothing " and " silence " vibrated at her back like plastic drapes . How could there be a word for silence ? A child 's lips might blow , the North wind bring snow , a few stars explode , boats rock , but whatever moved in air did not by necessity move in ears and require the word " silence " therefore . She had personally sunk to a level where she could product thought , and only " violence " remained a problem . It was common in her circle . A bush could turn into a fire , or a face at a clap of the hand could release spit and infection . The deviants were like herself unable to control their feelings . Los Angeles for them was only hostile as a real situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the canyons and overnight turned them sloshy . Then they hid in underground places , carrying Must the Morgue Be My Only Shelter ? signs . But the rest of the time the sort of whiteness spread out by a Southland sun kept them warm , and they could shit whenever they wanted to , in those places they had long ago staked out . My personal angel is my maid , said one to another , putting down his Rilke with a gentle smile . <p> My Song , My Only Song Goes : One Is My Lucky Number ! Her sneakers were wearing down to two gnarled scoops , but she was never surprised that the vertical pronoun was also a number . On the apophatic path you choose to stay at the edge of the central city where you get a quasi-this and a quasi-that . In the diplomatic world transparency means non-ideological , neutral . In the walking world , it means eternal , invisible . One day clouds muffin against a tinny sky . L.A. 's a dirt heap , really , stuck with green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slabbish city . Cold and square as Forest Lawn . Why put a cake on a plate before putting it in your mouth ? Why use a napkin instead of a sleeve to wipe away the dribble ? I mean when I was walking the streets . . . she could n't conceive of her own loneliness ; Captain bass-playing melodies got to it , though , a black sax , like a footbridge over cognac . New York is a whole deal . Yoni , scared as a red anarchist , was given to every woman . Even her stepsister could say it twice . And her stepsister would say , exactly the way she would , " My stepsister hoped I would fail . " B-minus was her score . She began by a drink or three to keep her moving down lubricated avenues . There the faces of brown-skinned boys presented her with the problem of beauty . Africa refused to leave them alone in America . For this great act of mercy she was happy : for them there would be no erasure ! Their beauty Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam getting Even , it was as basic as a billy club . Let the academics sneer at the Jesuits , and go on being the hypocritical clerics of the century , she at least dared to believe in retribution . While one derelict liked malt , barley , and high altitudes , most of the others like herself preferred a cloud of mimosa breaking down the chicken wire , and feet firmly planted on the names of the stars embossed in Hollywood Boulevard . She had her private " names for the days of the weak "  --  Man Day , Dues Day , Wine Day , Thirst Day , Fried Day , Sat-Around Day , and God 's Day . These were written in the ground under her body 's weight , where she was pleased to keep them . <p> <p> <p> By FANNY HOWE <p>
