In the treasure hunt for promising stocks , investors often rely on tried and true markers to find the best buys : Low price/earnings multiples , rich asset values , and lofty dividend yields are among the most popular . Trouble is , the last of those guides , the high yield , can also saddle you with hefty taxes that will lower your return . Three million taxpayers earning $75,000 to $100,000 a year paid about $1.5 billion in taxes on their $7.4 billion in dividends in 1989 , according to the most recent figures available from the Internal Revenue Service . That works out to an average hit of about $500 for each taxpayer . When figuring the prospective return of a stock , an investor should consider whether a high yield is worth the cost . To show how the tax bite on dividends drags down the payoff from stocks , we looked at the 100 largest corporations on the Fortune 500 list in this issue . ( List omitted ) For each company we calculated the average annual total return ( capital gains or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking into account the effect of taxes on dividends . The pretax total return was figured assuming that shareholders reinvested their dividends when paid . For the after-tax total return , dividends were also reinvested , but only after being taxed at the marginal rate for an individual making about $100,000 a year . The results : An investor who bought $100 of stock ten years ago in each of the top 100 would have seen his $10,000 stake grow to $61,473 before taxes by the end of last year . But if the investor had to pay taxes on the dividends before reinvesting , that same $10,000 stake would have bulked up to only $53,255 by the end of 1991 . That 's $8,218 gone to the tax man . The difference in returns is used to determine something that we call tax efficiency . It is calculated by dividing the annual average return from a stock after tax by the average annual return pretax . A stock that pays off handsomely before tax , but loses a lot of luster on April 15 , is deemed less tax efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The winners in tax efficiency , not surprisingly , are those stocks that provide most or all of the return in the form of capital gains . In close calls choosing between two stocks , tax efficiency can be the deciding factor . As an example , look at Xerox and Hewlett-Packard . Over the past ten years the total return from Xerox averaged 12% annually before taxes , a hair above HP 's 11.9% . But after taxes HP pulls ahead , posting an average annual return of 11.6% , while Xerox tallied only 9.5% . Why ? HP paid a total of $2.69 a share in dividends over the past ten years , while Xerox paid more than that each year  --  $3 a share annually for the past ten years . Hewlett-Packard 's tax efficiency puts it in a whole new stratum of stocks . On an after-tax basis HP ranks right up there near Texaco , which provided an average 15.6% return over the same period , before taxes . The simplest way for investors to achieve tax efficiency is to stick with growth companies that pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any low-dividend stock . Look for a company that stands to earn more on the cash that it retains than you could get in an alternative investment if you were paid a dividend . The best measure of what a business can do with spare cash is its return on shareholders ' equity . If the company 's prospective ROE is several points higher than the rate that you can get on alternative investments , say a five-year bond , then you are better off if management hangs on to the profits . Says Rod Linafelter , co-portfolio manager for the Berger 100 Fund in Denver : " The truly great growth companies in America do n't pay dividends anymore . " If a promising company does pay a dividend , then the smaller the check the better . Since 1982 PepsiCo has raised its dividend all of 30 cents , from 18 cents to 48 cents a share last year . Over the same time , Pepsi 's net profit nearly quintupled from $224 million to $1.1 billion . But you will find few investors complaining about low dividends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on thrived , growing an average 21.6% a year , measured by PepsiCo 's ROE , free of individual income tax . Tax efficiency : a bubbly 0.95 . Archer-Daniels-Midland , the Decatur , Illinois , processor of agricultural commodities , pays the tiniest of dividends ; its 10 cents a share comes to only 6% of earnings , far below the average payout of S &P; 500 companies over the past five years of 55% . That helps explain how the ten-year average total return works out to 21% before taxes and 20.6% after , for a tax efficiency of 0.98 . ADM 's chief executive , Dwayne Andreas , prefers to bypass the tax man by paying stock dividends , which are not taxed until the shares are sold . Academics like Burton Malkiel of Princeton scorn paper payouts as valueless . In effect , they say , stock dividends simply cut the pizza into more slices but do nothing to enrich the stockholder . True , but Andreas insists that his shareholders get a psychological boost from the stock dividend , and it gives them a choice over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to hold on to it and pay no tax until they liquidate . Andreas also likes the stock dividend because it helps him keep his stock price in the $20 range , where he feels it is most attractive to small investors . Despite the obvious advantages of owning low-dividend , high-growth stocks , individual investors still hold big pieces of high-dividend equities . About two-thirds of the outstanding stock in General Motors is in Joe and Jane Smith 's hands . Small investors also own more than half of Big Blue 's shares . Presumably some of those folks hold the stock through tax-exempt accounts , such as IRAs , but many do n't . Just why investors love high-dividend-paying stocks is something of a conundrum among the experts . Nobel Prize winners Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani studied the investment value of dividends in the early 1960s and found that even in a tax-free world , dividends offer no value to the investor . Once you account for income taxes , dividends are at a distinct disadvantage to capital gains . His findings were particularly stinging at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on dividends , but paid only 25% on capital gains . Nowadays , with tax rates lower and the differential between the rates on capital gains and ordinary income all but gone , the disadvantage of dividends is less . But Miller is still no touter of dividends . Says he : " A new argument holds that the dividend is important because at least the shareholder gets the money , and the managers , who may otherwise pour the money down their rat holes on misguided projects and acquisitions , do n't . One would hope there would be other ways to discipline management . John Childs , a senior vice president of Kidder Peabody and a noted authority on dividend policy , points out that , logical or not , investors want dividends for a panoply of reasons . One of the biggest is the wish to wring some cash out of the stock while waiting for capital appreciation . Sounds sensible . But it turns out that many investors in high-yielding stocks simply take their dividends , incur the tax , and plow the cash right back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third of IBM 's individual shareholders reinvest their dividends . These investors are taking big tax hits on income that they clearly do n't need . If you do need spending money from your investments , you may be better off if you cut your stake in two . Relegate part to tax-free municipal bonds , recently yielding a fat 6.8% , and the rest to low-or even no-dividend growth stocks . It will take fewer dollars to generate the same amount of cash from the bond , and you will have better diversification and no annual tax bite . A TAX-EFFICIENT BONANZA The shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway were asked in May 1985 if they wanted to receive a dividend . Since 1969 , when Warren Buffett became CEO of the company , they had never been given one . Instead , as Buffett has eloquently explained in his annual reports , all retained earnings , shorn of corporate taxes , have been reinvested to maximize shareholder returns . Did those same " owner-partners , " as he calls them , want him to continue that policy or not ? An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says CFO Verne McKenzie : " In the last three years Berkshire 's net worth has doubled . If we had paid out all that net worth as a dividend , I 'm not sure our shareholders could have collectively doubled their investments . " In the past ten years , Berkshire returned an average of 32.1% per year , almost twice the return of Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index . Says John Tilson , who runs the top-performing Pasadena Growth Fund : " For a company with Berkshire 's high returns , and its strong franchise , paying dividends is absurd . " Tilson loves Berkshire Hathaway , which at a recent price of $8,900 a share is still 5% to 10% undervalued by his estimates . Rx FOR INCOME-DEFICIENT PORTFOLIOS If you 're smart enough to keep dividend-rich stocks in a tax-exempt portfolio , such as an IRA , you 'll be spared the tax headaches . But you 'll still face the challenge of finding high-yield stocks with solid growth prospects  --  no easy task . One group with a proven ability to deliver on both counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous cash investments in drug research and development with chunky yields and dividend increases averaging 10% or more a year . In recent months drug stocks have become bargains as investors , anticipating a recovery , have shifted funds out of recession-resistant stocks like drugs into basic industry shares like paper and chemicals . Among the most attractive buys now , analysts say , is Bristol-Myers Squibb , which sells for about $80 a share , down from $89 in January , and pays a dividend of $2.76 , for a yield of 3.4% . It 's not the upfront yield that makes this stock so tempting , but the growth . The company has increased its dividend at an 18% annual rate since 1981 . Says Nola Falcone , manager of the Evergreen Total Return Fund : " If you bought the stock in 1981 for $11.50 , it was yielding 3.9% . Today , on the initial investment , it 's yielding 24% . " Bristol-Myers Squibb 's future appears as bright as its past . " This stock is clearly the favorite , " says Ron Nordmann , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrific flow of new products ; only 30 new drugs were approved by the FDA last year and Bristol-Myers Squibb had four of them . " Those included two cardiovascular drugs , an antibiotic , and Videx , an antiviral drug for combating AIDS . Nordmann expects the company to increase earnings 16% to 18% a year over the next five years , with a commensurate rise in the dividend . American Home Products is also appealing to dividend fans . Though the stock scared off some investors after its spectacular 61% rise in 1991 , so far this year it has cooled off by 10% , and interest is beginning to rekindle . " This company is committed to its dividend , and its growth rate should accelerate , " says Falcone . Earnings grew 11% last year , and she expects them to rise 12% this year and 13% in 1993 . Those projections are largely based on drugs that have already received approval . Says Falcone , " AHP launched two very good drugs in 1991 . Lodine , an anti-arthritis drug , has changed my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implantable contraceptive that has surprised people and really taken off . " American Home 's stock trades for around $76 a share and yields 3.4% . <p>
