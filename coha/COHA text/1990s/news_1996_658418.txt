<p> Operation Night Light starts with a knock on the door . " Boston police ! " yells detective Robert Fratalia of the Youth Violence Strike Force . A wide-eyed grandmother opens the apartment door . Mr. Fratalia towers over her . <p> " Evening , ma'am , " he says quietly . With him are his partner , detective Fred Waggett , and Tony Wright , a probation officer . " Is George here ? " <p> If he is n't , George is breaking a court-ordered curfew as a condition of being put on probation for drug use . <p> Operation Night Light , a cooperative effort between the Boston police and the probation department , sends officers on nightly visits to the homes of young probationers up to age 22 . The program is part of a growing number of efforts designed to help keep offenders from committing more crimes . <p> In contrast to the increasing focus at both the state and national level on prison sentences for young offenders , a growing number of communities are choosing to intervene instead through community-based programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach all but the most violent offenders , helping to prevent crime and change behavior . And they can be operated at less than half the cost of locking up offenders in already crowded prisons . <p> In response to the Boston officers ' visit , George suddenly appears in the doorway of a small , cluttered bedroom ; he is sullen and scared . Mr. Wright breaks the bad news . <p> " George , you had a dirty urine test . " Traces of cocaine were found in a random test required as part of George 's probation . George is silent , his eyes cast down . The officers ask to search his room . George steps aside . His girlfriend stands nearby . <p> While the officers go through the room , George 's grandmother alternately defends and complains about her grandson . " He 's always asking me for money , " she says . " I never see him with no money , so how can he be a big-time dealer ? I talk to him , but he do n't listen . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it and a packet of plastic baggies commonly used on the streets to peddle drugs . But no drugs are found in the room . " It does n't look good , " says Wright , who strongly suggests that George and his grandmother come to the office tomorrow for a talk . " Yes , we 'll be there , " the grandmother says . <p> Operation Night Light was launched four years ago as a result of a rapidly escalating homicide rate in Boston . The police cracked down , sending more youths to court , thereby increasing the contact between police and probation officers in and around courtrooms . <p> " Both departments began to see how much they knew about gangs that could be shared , " says Bernard Fitzgerald , chief probation officer at Dorchester District Court . Police and probation officers formed Operation Night Light to replace a street program that was discontinued . <p> Fratalia and another officer checked curfews for the first time late in 1992 . Across Massachusetts now , 15 jurisdictions use the program . Only Knoxville , Tenn. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daytime hours only . <p> The program 's success in reducing crime in Boston is hard to measure because the stream of unsupervised youths feeding into street gangs remains high . Divert one youth from crime and often two others take his place . <p> Officers point out that building a life in the toughest parts of the inner city can be a daunting task for a young person . One Boston probation officer has seen 55 of the youths on his caseload either murdered or convicted of murder in the last five years . " It 's difficult to measure prevention , " Mr. Fitzgerald says of the program , " but I think we keep things from getting worse . " <p> Their efforts may also help reduce the cost of fighting crime . In Massachusetts , minimal supervision of most probationers costs around $ 1,000 a year . But the average annual cost of maintaining an inmate in prison is around $ 30,000 a year in most states . <p> " We 've never really done anything in between , " says Fitzgerald . " Maybe we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a community program , and save the state around $ 20,000 , " he says . " We know that programs like Operation Night Light can be part of a whole community effort . " <p> On any given day in Massachusetts about 84,000 people are under some form of probation . Of that group about 8,000 are considered to be high-risk , requiring intensive supervision . <p> During the night , officers Fratalia and Waggett , and Mr. Wright , visit eight homes . No probationers are missing , and one boy is sound asleep in his room . " This turkey is asleep at 9:30 or else , " says his mother . She thanks the men for coming . <p> Later , another mother , standing with her son and saying he was on the honor roll at school , mentions that he was attacked on the subway . A scar on his left cheek reaches from ear to chin . She refuses to allow him to ride the subway and withdrew him from the school . Wright discusses school options with her and they agree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light is welcomed more by parents than youths . " Sometimes parents do n't know their kid has been arrested , " Wright says . " There 's lots of single family parents here , and they 're looking for help . " <p> For Michael Williams , who served time for gun possession and drugs , and is now a new barber in Dorchester , being on probation was a time to think through his choices . " I was listening to the stories of older guys going back and forth to jail , " he says . " I did n't want to follow the same footsteps , so I had to change . What 's worth more than life ? It ai n't worth being out on the streets risking your life for things not worth more than life . " He says Wright was always there , " always ready to talk . " <p> More than once , a youth on probation has used the excuse of having to be home for curfew to avoid gang activity . " Nobody wants to go back to jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a way for a kid to get off the streets rather than saying , ' I do n't want to be in the gang anymore . ' Do that and you 're an outcast . " <p> Caseloads for probation officers can be as high as 130 , but many of the less troubling cases are seen only once month or less . Compounding the problems of the high-risk segment is an illiteracy rate of nearly 50 percent . <p> " Not every offender is the same , " says Don Cochrane , Probation Commissioner of Massachusetts , " and if we expect the school failure , or the employment failure , or the substance abuser to survive as a law abiding citizen , we need different types of controls and different strategies to deal with them . " <p> In communities in such states as Iowa , Georgia , Vermont , Minnesota , and Connecticut various " intermediate sanctions " are increasingly used to control offenders ' movements . These include house arrests , curfews , drug and alcohol tests , victim restitution , mandatory school or treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic monitoring . <p> Recently the Massachusetts legislature passed a $ 486 million prison construction bond that includes $ 15 million for community based corrections . " Even though the money has n't been allocated yet , some of our programs already in place need support , " says Cochrane , " and with new funds we can bring programs to communities that need them .
