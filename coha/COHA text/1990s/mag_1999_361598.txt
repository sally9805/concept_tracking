The author of the stunning Regeneration trilogy clearly has still more to say about World War I. Geordie , 101 , on his deathbed , is haunted by visions of the trenches and the death of his brother . His grandson Nick , who is nursing him , is struggling instead with one of the modern age 's versions of warfare , a cobbled together , dysfunctional family . Nick moves between his grandfather 's past and his own unsettled present wondering about survival . But Barker 's faith in the power of redemption lets her , and the reader , down : the hasty if elegiac conclusion promises a peace that is too easily won . <P>  --  By Elizabeth Gleick
