Godzilla is in the details . the Book tells us so . Among the commandments : Godzilla has three toes on each foot , not four ; Godzilla has four claws on each hand , not three ; Godzilla has three rows of ridges on his back , not one ; Godzilla eats fish , not people ; Godzilla can not be made to look silly ; Godzilla can not die . And , if you must ask , Godzilla does not endorse products . <P> The Book is a 75-page-plus compendium of iconographical dos and don'ts assembled over nearly a half-century by Toho Studios , Godzilla 's propagator and the cinematic demiurge of the Land of the Rising Saurians . This mishnah of the face and form and spirit of Japan 's most popular mutant antihero was solemnly handed to Dean Devlin , 35 , and Roland Emmerich , 42 , in 1996 , almost as soon as the pair signed to produce and direct a new version of the monster classic . " We had to read it before we could write the script , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Godzilla 's name in vain . <P> After perusing Toho 's holy writ and digesting its meaning , Emmerich faxed the parameters of the studio 's Godzilla-by-committee to Patrick Tatopoulos , creator of the aliens in Independence Day , the duo 's biggest hit so far . As fate would have it , Tatopoulos never got the fax . Forging ahead anyway , he designed a monster that tampers with nearly every rule in The Book and is likely to leave fans of the old radioactive reptile either in awe or screaming " Heresy ! " <P> Sony has bet more than $110 million on its new Godzilla , opening this week on an unprecedented 7,363 screens in hopes of breaking The Lost World 's record opening weekend take of $92.7 million . An additional $50 million has reportedly been spent on a marketing scheme that includes the ubiquitous tag line " Size Does Matter " and a carefully hyped campaign of secrecy about what the modernized creature looks like . In this age of Titanic expectations , Godzilla will have to bring in more than $200 million in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention to the folks at Sony the words New Coke . <P> It was probably inevitable that the King of the Monsters  --  who made his debut in a 1954 Japanese film ( re-edited and released in the U.S. two years later with new footage featuring Raymond Burr as an American reporter )  --  would sooner or later be remade . " For me , it was always very simple , " says Emmerich . " Godzilla was one of the last concepts of the ' 50s that had never been done in modern form  --  that idea of the giant monster as in Tarantula or The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms . Why not do them again ? " But , he says , " we were really concerned about the cheese factor . "
