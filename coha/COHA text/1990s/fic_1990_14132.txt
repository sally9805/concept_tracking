I know this body is but the cup for the river that is always running and that pleasure is the gift of the material self for the delectation of the spirit of others but this kind of pisses me off . Look , I sold my Nash Rambler and rendered up the money . I made over the checking account and accepted the daughter of delighted poverty ring . I have sung the fifteen simplicities over and over on six months of latrine gift , and chanted with full heart while we hauled the four hundred tons of creek rock to build the Palace of World Peace and Erotic Meditations but this is where I draw the line .

Ever try ten years of marriage on six hours of conversation ? If it were n't for gossip , children or grocery shopping , ninety percent of all marriages would be conducted in silence . The only ones without a limit are deeply neurotic , desperately narcissistic , drop-dead alcoholic or have dangerous criminal minds . All in all , it 's a bleak picture .

Now I 'll have me a decaf Cappuccino and a side order of small curd cottage cheese , an ' when I leave , senorita , you 're invited to ride . " Slipped his silk coat over my shoulders , offered me his arm , walked me past the truckers to an all white rig , says " Resurrection Express " in letters of flame .

WOMAN Honey , what the tight asses never teach you in school is when the end is . I 'd known that I 'd saved me about twelve years in two marriages .

It 's just one lopsided damn thing sittin ' next to another lopsided damn thing , how I see it . Do n't fit together any way you can make sense of , do they ? Third day with the architect we was waitin ' for the elevator and outta nowhere he asked me to marry him ! Honey , I was so God-damned surprised I said yes . ( Male actor exits . ) Elevator door opens , he steps inFell fourteen floors down an empty shaft . Now he lived , but the subject of marriage never came up again . ( Laughs . ) Drawing the circle .

WOMAN I do n't feel there 's a significant difference between us on this issue , Mr. Carlyle . I am willing to artificially depress our prices forcing you into a price war because it is my educated guess that our pockets are a little deeper and our markets a little better situated and we do n't have the same need for fluidity and capital that a little bird tells me you do . There is , as I 'm sure you 're aware , a natural process of selection in business as my father used to say , " When it 's time to go , it 's time to go . " Now in my opinion , you 've had your innings and in a nice way , a very nice way , you 've become a superfluous and even , though I do n't like to say this , an inhibiting factor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to sell or fold .

In the middle of the piece a man enters and lies down on the floor . The performer moves to the man and lies down as if she were in bed with him . WOMAN The moving van pulls away . I monitor myself for a reaction . What ? What am I feeling ? In point of fact I 'm ecstatic . The marriage is gone , he 's gone , the furniture is gone , I feel great ! Then I make a mistake and look in the mirror . Is anybody going to find this attractive ? I get instantanceous depression . I 'm ugly . Not to worry . My first week I have three dates . All right , two of them were married , but I 'm still counting them as dates . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out they have one thing in common . They 're all impotent . This is what they do n't tell you when you get a divorce . Melly , what is going on ? I worried available men would be ego-monstres dripping arrogance and command ; they 're not , they are sweet , vulnerable guys who have caught some kind of sexual flu . They 're in agony , they weep , they rage , you have to take Kleenex to bed . I decide all men from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. are living on an outpatient basis  --  poor babies ! They must exist in this paroxysm of dread . Completely focused on what they ca n't control . Totally defined by an irrational muscle . Passionately believing it 's all that matters . Found out despite the rest of their lives . One of them told me it was like cradling a corpse between his legs . And my jobmy job is to fix it . Or else to console the inconsolable . And all of thisall of his pain , all of my responsibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six seconds of abandon . And this , Melly , this is my dream of sexual freedom .

There are just certain things you should n't own because of the way the world is . Certain things you should n't do either , but I 'm not gettin ' into that . p. 22 Act 1 , Scene 14 : I Love You I LOVE YOU An actress sits on the floor and pulls a man down to lie in her lap . The piece ends in a kiss . They freeze . ACTRESS I love you . Always before I 've had to love on speculation . I could call it by its name but I knew it had a shelf life . Sort of the top of something that I knew was on the way down . Saying " I love you " was just pointing out your position on a loop . It was how you described a high point . Someone was beautiful and I loved that . Someone cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , thank God , forget myself and I loved that . But never , never was I crazy enough to turn myself over to it . As soon as I said it , I made damn sure I had it on a leash and I knew it died from repetition . The bottom line for me were the couples in restaurants who never say a word while they eat . I knew it all was reduced eventually to silence . Until you made it safe for me . No matter what happens , you always pay attention . Imagine that . To most people , paying attention is merely part of the acquisition . You pay attention so I can take myself seriously so I can take you seriously , so I pay attention . It 's miracle . I love you . p. 23 Act 1 , Scene 15 : Fried Chicken FRIED CHICKEN The actress sits in a vinyl chair , or is already there . She speaks dully and without emotion .

I said fuck you under my breath and he threw the beer . It hit me in the brest . He put me on the floor and said if it was a fuck I wanted , well a fuck I 'd get .

I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He slapped at himself like there was mosquitoes and then sat up straight and asked was something burning ?

Love being the fickle pursuit it is , there ai n't a whole lot of people wantin ' a short-term romance with anybody 's as good a shot as I am . It 's a hopeless damn thing tryin ' to mix a full-time career with a long-term relationship . You know when her hand hit the ground it held on to the card ? Surprised the hell out of me .

( She mimes downing a drink. ) p. 31 p. 32 Act 2 , Scene 3 : Encyclopedia Salesman ENCYCLOPEDIA SALESMAN With the full cast still onstage listening , the actress addresses the audience . ACTRESS Oh , I love those boys who sell encyclopedias with their bright eyes and souls ! Always dressed so nice , every bit as good as the Mormon missionaries , if you ask me . You will never see a grease spot on their ties , it is completely unheard of and that 's a fact . Oh , they come to do the mind honor and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Encyclopedia Britannica , World Book , Compton 's , House of Knowledge , Facts Illustrated , all of them . I always try to fix them a nice little something , maybe a quiche and some vegetable juice , nothing heavy . Then I sit right down in the hallway , with my heart pounding so I can catch the doorbell on the first ring.There is such a lovely formality to it all that it reminds me of the days when there was such a thing as society . And the graces . I pull back the wing chairs in the living room so he can spread out his full color charts and graphs and maps and samples and I curl up on the sofa with my tea and the conversation just buoys us up and carries us along as if we were sitting with our harps in the clouds . We usually start out with the Brazilian Rain forest and work our way right through stars and stellar populations to Yiddish literature and the Haskala traditions and sometimes dark will fall without our noticing and the ideas they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life of the mind now , it 's in encyclopedia sales . And those boys , those dear boys , it 's quite usual after you 've given them the check for them to kiss your hand when they leave , and smile and smile until your heart nearly breaks . p. 33 p. 34 Act 2 , Scene 4 : Jay JAY This piece begins with the actress sitting but early on she rises , moves the hassock stage right of the armchair with her foot and ends sitting on it . ACTRESS See , my vocation is giving pleasure . People are mainly scared of people . I read where most people only have two or three friends in a whole life , plus a couple of marriages . I was the high school mascot for the North Broderick Bears an ' I saw right off I was more popular as a bear than a person . There was always somebody wantin ' to pet me , play with me , tryin ' to look up my nose hole , see who I really was . Right then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the Virginia Tech Hokie , sort of a turkey kind of thing , which was good as it gave me bird experience . Later on I kind of free-lanced as a fresh water shrimp , and a year down at Disneyland as Daisy Duck , but that was generally too heavy a drug scene . My big break came at the National Baseball Card Show in Miami , where I did day work as the Toronto Blue Jay . Well , I was n't on the floor an hour before I got real attracted to the St. Louis Cardinal . Talk about your chemistry ! We started rubbin ' up to each other , whew , got so hot we snuck off to the broom closet . Guy heard something going on , opened the door , saw two giant birds in among the cleaning fluids screwin ' like they was an endangered species . Well , there were these little flaps . That guy laughed so hard he started to choke an ' I had to do the Humperdink maneuver on him to save his life . Turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got me on to work the fans . I 'm not out in public as a human more than eight , ten hours a month . Humans these days do n't have a sense of mystery . They 're pretty much what they are which is why they love me . Shoot , I would n't ever come out I did n't have to . Oh , I 'm into it . I go sky diving for the full effect . It 's a real shame it 's come down to where you have to leave your own species for a good life . That 's just about the end of the road I guess . ( The full cast exits except for the actress doing " Graceland " who puts on a pair of glasses and moves up behind the armchair. ) p. 35 p. 36 Act 2 , Scene 5 : Graceland GRACELAND A young woman on and off mike at the Graceland Reception Center . YOUNG WOMAN Good morning and welcome to Graceland , a division of Elvis Presley Enterprises . If you are buying tickets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Hello ? . homes , grounds , or attractions , please follow the blue line between the blue ropes . What 's that ? I 'm in the middle of an announcement , sirare you looking for the Elvis recreational bus or the automobile museum ? Combo ticket one for all attractions is available for $15.95 . That includessir , you in the " I got bombed at the Strategic Air Command Visitors Center " tractor hat , we would prefer you did that in your bedroom with a woman , ostensibly your wife . Sir , Combo 2 includes the automobile museum but not the bus . No , sir , there is no combo that includes the Lisa Marie jet airplane but not the auto museum . Because I say so . I am not at liberty to say why . Because that is what Elvis wants you to see on Combo 2 . I do not appreciate being called four-eyes , sir , when all I have is astigmatism . Get outta my face , sucker . Sir , I can not let you in , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because , sir , Elvis Presley died for your sins , and Mick Jagger is the Anti-Christ . Mick Jagger never recorded a Christmas song in his life , or served in the Army , or knew his gospel . He represents the foreign , bi-sexual annihilation of the rock-and-roll dream and he do n't set a foot in this sanctuary with you or without you ! Next ! ( She exits. ) p. 37 Act 2 , Scene 6 : Father 's Circle FATHER 'S CIRCLE The actress enters talking and sits in the rocker . She is alone onstage . ACTRESS My father was n't in my life exactly . If you drew a circle around a life he would be sitting just outside with his feet on the line , reading a book . Once , out of nowhere , like coming into focusI was twelve , I thinkhe stood up from the chair and took me on the ferry to Coney Island . It was like a date . I wore my black and white skirt with the rust blouse and two bows in my hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daughter . We went to the aquarium and saw Ookie , the gentleman walrus . It was a triumph . The keeper asked me to pet him . " Give him a kiss , " he said . " Ookie likes the ladies . " He had a papery feeling against my lips . My father laughed and clapped his hands . Actually clapped his hands . And then he took my arm and I remember looking at passersby to see if they knew we were a father and daughter . On the ferry ride back , we sat side by side and sang " Daisy , Daisy " very low so no one else could hear it and each had a Baby Ruth . Then we were home , and he stepped back outside the circle and picked up the book . I do n't think he came inside again . Maybe he did , but I do n't remember it . ( She remains sitting , an actor and actress move on from different entrances and confront each other . From time to time he tries briefly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Abortion Lawyer ABORTION LAWYER WOMAN Suitable ? No , actually that does n't seem " suitable " to me . It is , and I 'm sorry to say this , particularly coming from you , Brent , unacceptable after I 've done all the bloody prep and legwork on this case , to tell me now , at this point , the Attorney General 's office does n't want me to prosecute it . MAN You know why  --  WOMAN And no , I do n't think we get a " reverse spin " with a male attorney sticking it to abortion bombers and yes I do have an emotional view of the perpetrators and emphatically yes it makes me noticeably angry and they make me angry and you make me angry . Excuse me . Just hold on and I 'll get this down to a rational level . Breathe in , breathe out . O.K.Brent , you say my sex , no matter what I say , is an issue here . All right , granted for the sake of argument . Then it 's good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks like the gender most affected either does n't care or ca n't fight its own battles or is n't competent . They should know when they bomb medical facilities necessary to my freedom and well-being and then stand on a cross and wrap themselves in the flag that the cases will be fiercely prosecuted by the gender that has the most at stake . I am not only protected by legal process from these thugs , I am legal process and I will nail their self-righteous hides to the wall ! ( Two other actresses enter and stand watching . ) Now I intend to do two things : I intend to prosecute this case and I intend to eat lunch . You ca n't do anything about number one and you are cordially invited to number two , my treat . How about it ? ( She hits him fairly strongly on the shoulder for emphasis and exits. ) p. 39 p. 40 Act 2 , Scene 8 : Surprise SURPRISE One of the two actresses who entered during the last speech sits on the hassock and speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What replaces surprise ? There used to be surprises every day . The first time I asked a man to go to bed with me and he did . Finding out , suddenly , in college that I could do the work . Eating a brussel sprout and not minding . Realizing I actually had friends . Right through my thirties there were always surprises . Now I seem to see it all coming . Last week my brother-in-law stole change off my dresser . As soon as I knew it , I knew that I already knew he was capable of it . I suppose what happens is that you identify patterns . That in some larger sense you 're always just playing percentage baseball . What surprises me is that I do n't mind . What surprises me is that I have no nostalgia for surprises . What I guess interests me is why I 'm getting such pleasure from a world I can second guess ? We should be devastated , do n't you think ? I see pictures of Neptune , I see magnifications of aphids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just more of what was already there . What I think is it 's a theological/ biological preparation for non-existence . I think I 'm being prepared to leave . If the body releases chemicals that make pain more bearable then maybe it gives us a tolerance for repetition to make parting more bearable . That would be nice , do n't you think ? Otherwise we 'd always want to stay . Maybe that 's why we do n't mind . Maybe that 's why I 'm not looking for any surprises . ( The speaker moves the hassock back in front of the chair and exits . The actress listening moves up and sits in the armchair . A male actor leans against the wall above her , bored and irritated as Duke Pharsee. ) p. 41 p. 42 Act 2 , Scene 9 : Duke Pharsee DUKE PHARSEE Slapping herself and fanning herself simultaneously . ACTRESS You in there , Duke Pharsee ? You in there with the window open ? I hope you know what you 're doing in there ? You are letting mosquitoes roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road kill on the Hiawatha Bypass . You like a mosquito youself , Duke Pharsee . Eternally dressed in your yellow and black high school B-team letter jacket , suckin ' up my money on food , on magazine subsciptions like some Asian tiger mosquito got into the country in a shipment of used tires down to Houston or Galveston or some humid place like that . You the same kind of immigrant to my country with the agenda of siphoning off my life blood through the agency of my unchecked sexual attraction . It is my opinion that the itch precedes the bite and even attracts it . Do n't think I do n't recognize you as the parasite you are because I do . Just because I prefer love to be a minor irritation and not a preoccupation leaves me precisely at the mercy of small-time hustlers like you . Now slam shut that window , throw down my Cosmopolitan magazine , get your little stinger in here an ' let 's see if we can pass the time before the good shows come on the T.V. ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands behind her head . Holds a beat . She then rises as the actress doing the next piece enters , and she and the man assist the woman delicately as she sits on the hassock. ) p. 43 Act 2 , Scene 10 : No Personality NO PERSONALITY ACTRESS They tested me twice on account of their dumbfoundedness the first time . And those results they came down the same way both times . Within a fraction of a point , so they told me . " How 'd I do ? " I 'd say and they 'd get this startled look and they 'd say , " Well , Miss Latonia , we 're pleased to say it 's conclusive and definite , you do n't have a personality . " And I do n't . I 'd imagine there 's a lot of us here and there . More than you think . It 's hard to spot . You might be one . Now , if it turns out you are , do n't feel bad . The head doctor he told me not to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There has to be a rest period between ideas and you 're it . Look around you , " he said , " there 's a lot of people doing things and saying things , and things just go from bad to worse . They need you . " Well , I 'd never looked at it in that light , and I 've tried not to get a swelled head over it . You may be stuck with a personality but that does n't mean I ca n't respect you as a human being . ( She rises and moves downstage . ) The thing is that those that have a personality stew in it . They are sort of like telling the same joke to everybody . Whereas you and me are more free-floating , more restful to the passerby . More like watching water . The way things are , maybe we 're the coming thing . ( She sits in the vinyl chair . Another actress enters and speaks to the empty rocker . This speech is one long build to a crescendo. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAUGHTER ACTRESS This is n't fat , mother , this is bloom . The bloom on the rose . This is the radiance you read about in your two hundred romance novels a week . Do n't look down on the carpet . I 'm not on the carpet , mother . I 'm here in the kitchen near the refrigerator . You caught me , sheriff ! Two in the morning but you sniffed me out . I 'm the Sara Lee bandido . The Che Guevara of Haagen-Dazs ice cream . By day my name is Nutra-Slim but come sunset , I rip the calorie counter from my heart , I trample grapefruit and carrot sticks and celery under my Nike Air Cross-Trainers and I expand . I fill with cholesterol like a deranged zeppelin . I inhale cheesecake , I eat the graham crackers box and all . Bits of packaged ham and pepperoni flake my disordered hair . My fangs drip butter almond swirl . And with my eyes rolled back in my head I crash through the wall into your pristine , chintz , unendurably perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is me , mother . This is your nightmare daughter , you patronizing , priggish , punishing , unforgiving cancer of my life . " ( She holds for two beats and sits in the chair she has been speaking to . Another actress moves on talking and sits in the armchair . She never rises during this speech. ) p. 45 Act 2 , Scene 12 : Bees BEES ACTRESS They ai n't no honey climbers I know of anywhere outside Tennessee . Fadin ' out . Back of the hills they long on that fresh , wild honey up on the cliffs for hard doctorin ' an ' love potions , but there ai n't many will go up to get it . Ol ' Grandpa did the high hangin ' ' til his hands went stiff an ' he could n't hold rope . My brother , John Vale , took up , but he got his eyes stung out by a been swarm covered his face like a black mask . Leaves me . See , how you do is seek out the swarms on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across on a million bees . Got to drop down to ' em on a hemp twist ladder far as it takes . Sister Lilah , she hand climbs from below , sets a fire down of ' em , smokes that swarm off the comb . When they fly it 's like the sun risin ' ' cause there 's that golden honeyhouse where it was black with bees . I come down the hemp twist ladder , carve slabs from the comb , let it fall to a willow wove basket , lower it down to the ground . Air around your head 's got bees in it like ash from a fire . I 'm to where I can take thirty , forty stings an ' not hurt , nor swell , nor cry out . Only way they do n't swarm ya 's if you 're right with Jesus an ' cool as a stone . Johnny Vale he was doing ' it on nerve ' cause he stole an ' fornicated . Bee stung him on the nipple an ' he took the name in vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his face exploded his eyes like a grape . Thousand bees together they 's like a radio receiver for your heart . They know your sin 's in your sweat . They can sense in your rhythm if you 're ready for judgment . They know if there 's guile or there 's honey in the cells of your mind . See , Jesus is the order that holds off the Apocalypse . If he ai n't in the bloodstream , life eats you alive . ( An actress already onstage lies erotically on the stage floor in front of the armchair . Everyone else exits. ) p. 46 p. 47 Act 2 , Scene 13 : One Moment ONE MOMENT ACTRESS God , you 're beautiful . You must really work out . I 've been watching youfrom across the streetwith binoculars .

And now here we are . Oh God thatthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing that with that . Listen , before we make love would you mind filling out this form ?

The phone 's right there in case you have to call people for details . God , I want you . The thing I hate most is the man wearing a prophylactic for oral sex . The first time I saw a man with a rubber on his tongue I just about died laughing . Listen this is hard to say but if your history seems dicey I have a clear plastic shower curtain I could put over you and we could just kind of hold each otheryou know , after a milk bleach bath , or we could just do visual sex or a phone date , I mean if the surgical gloves put you off ? Look , I hate this , but would you mind if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . I know , let 's light the candles . ( The lights go down to a single pool of light on her . ) There .

JAY Whereas Alexis DiMathis ( hoo-boy ! ) preferred The Bride Came C.O.D . ( A temperamental oil heiress elopes with a Hollywood bandleader. ) p. 49 ALEXIS Hello , baby . You miss me ? JAY There was two kinds of scenes they liked ( scenes where we died ) an ' scenes where they died . In between we 'd eat gourmet an ' be chained to the bed for bouts of untamed sensuality ( an ' Shiatsu massage ) . It was a pretty good life .

Sixteenth floor . Fire ! Fire ! Open the door , we got your proverbial wall of flame . Great . The last thing I 'll remember will be the missionary position in a mirror . We go out on the balcony . This big . Inferno time . Can we jump ? No . Can we go back in ? No . I turn to my husband , I say , " Hey , at least we came before we went . " Tears run down his cheeks .

He 's in therapy . " Stuff . I seen stuff . You want to know something else ? My marriage broke up , I date him . You want to know something else ? I 'm pregnant . Weird hormonal chemistry , you know ? Sometimes filament spins out of my body . I 'm beginning to climb . ( Her eyes fill with tears . ) I 'm beginning to climb . ( She sits. ) p. 52 p. 53 Act 2 , Scene 16 : Roller Coaster ROLLER COASTER The actress speaking and the actress above her on the chair back sometimes move in unison to create the roller coaster . ACTRESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first fall that could put your heart in your forehead ! What a beauty ! It had incline roll drops , one left , one right that felt like they went on to Chicago and a slow draw up at 90 degrees that stood the hair on your toes on end ! Me and Sis waited two damn hours to get on that machine an ' when we jumped on , it took off . There was a gent there , I yelled , " Hey , man , the roll bars , " an ' he looked startled but we were on the incline and I yelled down , " She 's not in , Goddamnit . Throw the switch . Shut it down ! " I could see somebody start to run but we crested the top an ' it took off . " Grab the rail . Left hand . Now me . Not there , the belt . The belt ! Let me get an arm behindupmove forward behind you . I got it . I got you . Hold on . Hold fucking on . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bitch ! " We hit the loops . One , two , I saw Sis bite through her lip . Three , four , and her hand on the rail moved to her face and swinging out of the fourth loop she went out of the car in this rising arc making a shy little high-pitched noise and I wrench around and she was lying out sideways in the air and she saw me and she waved . Like you were supposed to wave when you left people . Like she lived in the air and she 'd never come down . Like it was the wildest best part of the ride . Like she was still alive . ( The speaker exits leaving the actress who began the evening sitting as she first did on the armchair back in a special. ) p. 54 p. 55 Act 2 , Scene 17 : Endings ENDINGS ACTRESS I sat in the chair by the bed watching him sleep until I ached from sitting and then went out to the tool shed where I had hidden the suitcase and put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do next in the yard listening to the trucks go by on the freeway down below . He was so good about beginnings and endings and summing things up and knowing what must be done and explaining why it was the way it was now and I 'd never seemed to have a talent for it . I owed him a good solid ending that he could carry around with him and trot out on occasions and gatherings but for the life of me I could n't think of one and it was a serious , hopeless failing and could n't be forgiven . I thought of so many things that had happened and then more things and more things , but I could n't make an explanation of them so I went back in and lay down beside him because if you ca n't explain endings , then you probably do n't deserve one . And he shifted and touched me lightly and that was familiar , and the shadows in the room were familiar , and the beginnings of the birds were familiar . And as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , it 's going on then . It 's going on . ( The lights dim slowly . ) CURTAIN CALL . p. 56 Act 2 , Scene 18 : Hams APPENDIX The author includes the following pieces for possible substitutions if casting or context would be improved by them . HAMS ACTRESS Before they put the highway through , well , I looked out over actual living grass . There was a cypress row and past that , scrub woods , wild flowers . I bought the house because of what was across the street . Nothing . Nothing was across the street . Dusk time I 'd sit on my porchlisten , never mind . Now I have trucks , more trucks . All right , life changes . Then they put up the billboard . I 've got six windows in front . Out each window I see a cartoon Shakespeare three stories high with a lampshade on his head carving a ham the size of my Volkswagen , and in day-glo letters it reads , " Ham It Up .

Attach chains to the top . Rent a 16-wheeler . Pop that clutch and I topple that son-of-a-bitch like Ozymandias ! And I dance , and dance , and drink myself insensate , and sleep eighteen hours . When I regain consciousness , they 're putting up the new sign . It 's a sliced ham with wings and a halo , playing a harp . " Pig Heaven . " There is a moment in life when you know what you will become . When you fully understand that there is only process , only struggle and that heroism is not the single reflexive blow , it is the power of repetition without hope . And when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not vacillate , you must not ruminate , you sell out ! After that , believe me , the world moves on and the prices go down . p. 57 p. 58 Act 2 , Scene 19 : Passing the Time PASSING THE TIME ACTRESS Are youyou 're going to think I 'm crazyAre you passing the time ? Sometimes I thinknever mind . A voice tells me that I 'm " passing the time . " A key meeting , for instance , the presentation to the client , wild adrenaline , jobs on the line , it sells . People are ecstatic , they 're like hugging andlook it 's a triumph andwell , I hear this cool laconic humorous voice saying , " Well , that 's passing the time . " I 've had it happen when I 'm making love . I 've heard it when I take flowers out to Mother 's cemetery . I bought a new car . Hey , that 's a big thing , that 's a twelve thousand dollar thing . I 'm driving it off the lot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is passing the time . " Things I love to do , people I want to be with , moments I 've been waiting for , " Well , that 's passing the time . " As if the real thing , the real , real thing , the thing that is n't " passing the time " is always where I 'm not . And I ca n't seem to make the simple , clear gesture , say the authentic thing , just for God 's sake be here . Just be here . I 'm living justjust a little off , you know just infinitestimally wrong . Missing my life by inches . Passing the time . p. 59 Act 2 , Scene 20 : Healin ' HEALIN ' ACTRESS Healin ' do n't ordinarily git born on you as is much supposed . More than usual it 's just passed along .

Them three I know from personal experience . They 're just incurable . Any other way you get ' em , you send for me . I got travelin ' gifts . p. 60 Act 2 , Scene 21 : Sounds You Make SOUNDS YOU MAKE ACTRESS There 's a very particular sound I associate with you . Just the smallest exhalation of breath . So light sometimes it 's just on the edge of being heard . But you mean me to hear it . It 's not spontaneous or surprised . It 's meant to wound . It 's meant to delicately remind me of my unreason . It intimates something soiled and hopelessly emotional . That you by all rights should disdain or reject in me but at the same time it makes you unassailably good because all you do is make the sound and that resigned , fluttering palms up gesture and stay reasonably silent in the face of what , if you did speak , you might call my provocations . And every time you do it , I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't been accepting or forgiving or forebearing . I 've had the immense bad taste to feel something when you did n't instigate it , or ask for it or , worse yet , simply were n't in the mood for it . And the worst of it is that it 's so painfully clear how much you enjoy what you 're feeling about me and how you want me to hear you feeling it . So that I realize that now what used to be my pleasure in your company has become this longing to never , never , never hear you make that sound again . Never . Never . p. 61 Act 2 , Scene 22 : Softball SOFTBALL A game of fast-pitch softball . A pitcher . She throws one . PITCHER God , I hate softball . Two more outs I got my three hundred sixty-third no-hitter . ( She pitches . ) Two more games we got our eighteenth straight world championship . Kind of takes the thrill out it . ( She pitches . ) Another damn strikeout . Last July I fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count . ( She pitches . ) I 'm a damn immortal for $600 a week playing for a solid pack tuna company I would n't feed to my cat . ( She pitches . ) I had this record in the Bigs I would own a state . Bonuses ! Do n't talk to me about bonuses . Every time I strike out twenty , I get a free cheese pizza . Toppings is extra . ( She pitches . ) God I hate this batter . Guy doing the stats says 80% of my career strikeouts is blondes with natural curl . ( She pitches . ) Ball ? My ass that was a ball , ump . You 're calling a strike zone about as big as her tits . I take that back . Her tits was the strike zone , we 'd a had a twenty-seven straight walks here . ( She pitches. )
