He wears pinstripe suits with suspenders and is addressed as " Mr. Ambassador . " But Mickey Kantor is no diplomat . Take , for example , the way he described French negotiators who have fought to retain barriers to American farm exports : they have " held their breath and stomped their little feet , " he said in an interview last week . Publicly , he has threatened retaliation against half a dozen " unfair " trade practices by the Europeans , the Japanese and others . And in response to foreign officials who sputter about his " bullying " tactics , he says with a tight smile and easy Tennessee drawl , " I think our message is getting through . " <P> A political wheeler-dealer who was Bill Clinton 's surprise choice to be U.S. Trade Representative , Kantor had little experience in the acronymic arcana of GATT and NAFTA and other trade agreements . Yet he has proved a remarkably quick study , in the manner of a crack litigator mastering a complex brief . He is , by training and nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a peacemaker but as a warrior who , as he puts it , " hates to lose . " ( Those who beat him at tennis have learned to watch out for his flying racquet . ) He has represented migrant farmworkers and lobbied on behalf of giant oil and aerospace companies . Now , he says , he has two new clients : Bill Clinton and " the American worker . " <P> So do n't expect the occasional tiffs over Chablis and microchip exports  --  which occasionally punctuated the relatively laid-back approach to trade during the Bush and Reagan years  --  to be settled quite so amicably in the future . President Clinton has , like many moderate Democrats , publicly straddled the trade-off between creating export jobs at home and subjecting U.S. workers to increasing competition from abroad . His speeches gently emphasize the goal of free trade one day , while sounding off against " unfair " competition the next . But behind closed doors , a tough new policy is emerging , and Kantor is primed to play its bad cop . <P> The stakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self- sufficient in the 1950s and 1960s has become increasingly dependent on exports for economic growth . Just in the years between 1986 and 1990 , the number of Americans who produce goods for export jumped to 7.2 million from 5 million . Export-related jobs have grown throughout the economic slump , and they pay about $3,500 more a year than the average American job . If Kantor is successful in negotiating lower trade barriers , says Senator Max Baucus , a Montana Democrat influential on trade issues , he " will create more new jobs in America than any other Cabinet member . " <P> On trade , as with music and much else , Clinton 's and Kantor 's differences with their predecessors are not only political but generational as well . George Bush and his closest advisers were raised in the Great Depression and seared by World War II , and they blamed both calamities in large part on what Bush called " those Smoot-Hawley days "  --  a reference to the protectionist 1930 U.S. tariff that crippled the world trading system . Under Bush , says one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese knew that if they held out long enough , we would n't retaliate in any serious way , out of fear that we might trigger another escalation of trade barriers like in the ' 30s.
