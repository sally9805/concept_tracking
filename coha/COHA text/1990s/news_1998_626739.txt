<p> Pauline White , a postal worker and grandparent , still gives a pride-of-ownership smile about the modest brick home her family watched take shape atop a grassy prairie 19 years ago . <p> " I 've had a hard struggle , " White said . " But I 'm determined that this house is going to continue to be the foundation for our family , for the kids , when I 'm gone . " <p> White thought her biggest threat to keeping her house would be divorce proceedings four years ago . Instead , it began in part with a more unlikely problem - a bare basketball hoop . <p> When the strife ended in late 1996 , the Northglen Association had a court order barring her from future deed restriction violations . She did not worry because she already had complied with notices by hanging another net on the long-unused goal , trimming her yard and repairing a garage door . <p> However , White said she was horrified by another section of that final court judgment - authorizing Northglen to have the sheriff seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance fees . <p> She would have to borrow from her retirement fund to pay $ 5,600 to save her house . Her actual debt was $ 981 , with the rest required to pay Northglen attorney bills and legal fees for suing her . <p> **** <p> By all indications , White 's expensive lesson in Texas property law is one yet to be learned by most homeowners , even as it is being applied more frequently by the expanding numbers of associations . <p> Property owners associations enjoy unique status among creditors in Texas . They are among few entities empowered with foreclosure authority . Owners can have their homes taken away and sold to satisfy assessment debts of a few hundred dollars or less . <p> Property associations and their attorneys are quick to explain that this authority is seldom invoked , reserved as a last resort for those who refuse all reasonable requests for payments of delinquent maintenance fees . <p> Comparatively few foreclosure suits are filed , considering that associations cover about 100,000 homes in the county . Defenders say most delinquent homeowners settle their debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized homesteads . Regardless of those suits , foreclosures would occur because many of the owners can not pay their mortgages or fees , association attorneys said . <p> However , the foreclosure power has prompted new criticism and reviews . In a state known for zealous safeguards of homesteads , Texas officials say there are concerns about the potential for abuses by applications of a law frequently misunderstood by the general public . <p> That confusion was reflected in a recent hearing of the Senate Interim Committee on State Affairs . <p> Critics - many of them people who lost their homes - often assailed their own attorneys , title companies and others in affixing blame for foreclosures by associations . <p> " There needs to be balance on this , " state Sen. Jerry Patterson , R-Houston , said later . " I think there is plenty of room for reform . " <p> Not surprisingly , Harris County is the hotbed for homeowner complaints about the state law . <p> Bruce Burton , a real estate law professor at South Texas College of Law of Texas A &M; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overwhelming weapon of choice for communities in a region famous - or infamous - for its absence of zoning . <p> " Houston has no zoning , so ( association enforcement ) is probably used more here than anywhere else in the world , " Burton said . There already are more than 2,000 residential property associations , ranging from townhouse groups of a few units to subdivisions twice the size of typical Texas towns . <p> A review of district court lawsuits shows that associations are applying the foreclosure law in record numbers here , even during a robust economy . <p> In the first four months of this year , property owner associations filed 390 foreclosure suits in Harris County . That is more than the total for any of the entire years from 1988 , when the Texas Supreme Court upheld the foreclosures , to 1991 . Association foreclosure suits have risen steadily through most of this decade , from a few hundred annually to 1,050 in 1997 . <p> Attorneys predict even higher increases with the expansion of property owners associations . More groups are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a 1995 Texas law broadened the ability of homeowners to create associations and change from voluntary to mandatory collections , under certain circumstances . However , the foreclosure power would only take effect on future buyers of homes in those associations . That complies with the 1988 court ruling , Supreme Court justices noted that associations and fee requirements are in place first and supersede later homestead exemptions filed by purchasers of houses . <p> The law is restricted to subdivisions with land in Harris County . <p> Association lobbying groups also worked against a 1995 bill sponsored by Sen. Rodney Ellis , D-Houston , calling for a statewide vote on whether associations should retain foreclosure powers . Ellis said he introduced it in response to allegations of abuses of that authority by associations . The bill died in committee . <p> Patterson said he believes an unsuccessful bill sponsored by him in the last session will be revived to require notification in simple language that buyers of houses can lose their homesteads through foreclosures by associations . <p> Under that proposal , Patterson said homebuyers at house closings would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homesteads can be seized for nonpayment of certain debts such as maintenance fees . The mortgage banking industry argued that the measure would add to what already is an unworkable mound of legally required paperwork presented to homebuyers . <p> Patterson said such a notice would be a first step to clear away a maze of misunderstanding about the law . He said he is endlessly surprised to hear " even college-educated people stand up in forums " and misstate homestead protections . <p> In the recent Senate hearing , Harvella Jones showed a 1994 letter from then-U.S . Rep. Craig Washington . It assured her - wrongly - that her homestead could not be subject to foreclosure for maintenance fee debts . Jones had her $ 75,000 house auctioned for $ 185 and the remaining mortgage amount , she said . <p> Officials of property owners associations and management companies said they also support new ways to increase the awareness about the consequences of ignoring maintenance fee charges . <p> " In the ' 80s , this area was the big ' melting pot ' for people coming in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Many of them were from the North , where there is zoning without maintenance fees . So this , to them , was totally unheard of . " <p> Walleck is an official with Consolidated Management Co. , which works with property associations representing about 10,000 residences . She said the influx of outsiders is continuing , along with the problems of convincing them that associations mean business about maintenance bills . " It is the only ' hammer ' we have to ensure payment , " she said . <p> However , Walleck said ignorance of the law is seldom an excuse by the time associations have to initiate formal foreclosure suits . At that point , the original bill is typically past due by nine or more months . <p> Each board of directors sets policies on collections and foreclosure actions , so they vary among associations . Walleck said delinquent homeowners usually receive at least six notices - over six months or longer - advising them of the consequences of non-payment . <p> Many associations may hold off on legal action for two years or longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments of perhaps $ 50 quarterly , Walleck said . <p> Maintenance or assessment fees provide the funding for a variety of services determined by the individual associations . In the unincorporated areas of Harris County , these may include costs for basic services such as utilities , street lighting , security , mosquito eradication and more . They pay for whatever recreational amenities an association may have , as well as enforcement of deed restrictions and management services . <p> Officials with Community Associations Institute ( CAI ) , an umbrella organization for property groups nationally , said the appeal of community associations is evident by their popularity . Developers view them as an effective marketing tool for home sales , and buyers often insist on having an association to safeguard property interests by enforcing deed restrictions , CAI officials said . <p> Austin attorney Larry Niemann , representing the state branch of CAI , told the Senate hearing , " The buying public is insisting more and more on stiff regulations with enforcement powers . . . They like to see strong associations . If those associations become impotent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects the value of the homes . " <p> Officials of associations emphasized their willingness to work with financially struggling homeowners to avoid a foreclosure process , Ray Zobel told the Senate hearing . He is past president of the Cypress Creek United Civic Association , the largest coalition of property owner groups in the area . <p> Zobel said there was never a need to foreclose on a homeowner in his 10 years on the board of his Canterbury Forest Civic Association , a community of $ 90,000 homes with $ 125 annual fees . <p> In the Senate hearing , those compassionate approaches were countered by a few critics who said overbearing associations hit them with foreclosure actions during times of personal hardship . <p> Linda Moody , a former school cafeteria worker of the Cypress area , said she suffered a stroke in 1993 and sought a payment plan from her association to spare her home of 11 years . She said she borrowed $ 800 toward the $ 900 assessment debt , but was sued anyway because she could not pay the $ 2,000 in association attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned of the foreclosure clout last year after he was laid off from his job . He said he put a priority on his mortgage payments on his house of nine years . Nonpayment of his Northglen Association fees and some other bills might result in property liens , but those debts could be retired when he was back to work , he said . <p> He received his foreclosure letter and found himself evicted from his home , Lopez said . " I know we probably can not stop this home association ' thing , ' but we can do something to correct it , " he told the committee . <p> Attorneys for community associations disputed the versions of events outlined by those who had lost their houses through foreclosures . Patterson and other senators pointed out that associations are set up as a democratic process and that any governing board that was too overbearing would likely be voted out by the membership . <p> Michael T. Gainer , an attorney who specializes in association representation , said many critics at the Senate hearing are those who simply refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lost her house after withholding payments to protest her association 's decision to fund the purchase of a radar speed gun for patrolling deputies . <p> " When you have n't paid any assessments - not a single solitary dime in years - do n't you expect to get sued ? " Gainer asked . <p> " There are probably no more than a dozen complaining . They had their day in court , and they lost . " <p> Awaiting a court date is Geneva Kirk Brooks , a longtime gadfly and anti-pornography crusader now clashing with the Northglen Association over two rental houses she owns in that northwest Harris County neighborhood . <p> Among the accusations leveled by Brooks is that the system of notices is especially unfair to minorities and to absentee landlords like herself . <p> " Our contention is that they target absentee landlords , who are not around , and minorities , particularly those with English as a second language , " Ken Okorie , her attorney said . " Those are the ones least able to understand and exercise their rights in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a previous owner 's address , instead of Brooks ' . When the mistake was corrected , Brooks paid the fees . She is balking at paying several thousand dollars in association attorney fees for that and legal action over alleged deed violation actions . <p> Regardless , the association maintains she is liable for the costs and that she had the responsibility to update the ownership and address information . Brooks accuses the association of trying to intimidate her with petty violation notices . <p> She was cited for having a baton-size tree stump in her yard , for an oil stain on a driveway , a mildew spot on bricks and chipped chimney paint . In depositions , the association admitted it made a mistake by ordering her to remove a boat and a visible satellite dish - things that had never been on that property . <p> In January , Brooks led an effort to call a special meeting to oust the board of directors . The association sued her and others involved , asking for a permanent injunction to stop her and other defendants from spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That suit said actions were designed to help the defendants in other association suits against them . <p> Brooks countersued with lengthy allegations of wrongdoing by the association . She contended its suit was an effort to intimidate her . <p> Association attorney William Gammon and the management company refused to return phone calls on the dispute . <p> One of the defendants in the latest association suit is the woman with the basketball net , Pauline White . She said her only involvement was lending her name to a committee created by Brooks . <p> White said she learned her lesson with the brush with foreclosure in 1996 . She paid her assessment fees for the following two years , but is now mystified by another entry on her association financial statement . <p> It is a charge for $ 1,200 in legal services for 1997 , with no further explanation . <p> " Do they really think I 'm stupid enough to pay them thousands of dollars for what happened , then turn around and do it again ? " White asked . " I hope we are @ @ @ @ @ @
