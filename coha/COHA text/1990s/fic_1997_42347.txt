The Chicken Mask was sorrowful , Sis . The Chicken Mask was supposed to hustle business ; it was supposed to invite the customer to gorge him or herself within our establishment ; it was supposed to be endearing and funny ; it was supposed to be an accurate representation of the featured item on our menu . But , Sis , in a practical setting , in test markets-like right out in front of the restaurant-the Chicken Mask had a plaintive aspect , a blue quality ( it was stifling , too , even in cold weather ) , so that I 'd be walking down Main , by the waterfront , after you were gone , back and forth in front of Hot Bird ( Bucket of Drumsticks , $2.99 ) , wearing out my imitation basketball sneakers from Wal-Mart , pudgy in my black jogging suit , lurching along in the sandwich board , and the kids would hustle up to me , tugging on the wrists of their harried , underfinanced moms . The kids would get bored with me almost immediately . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all at once there were no secrets here in our town of service-economy franchising : I was the guy working nine to five in a Chicken Mask , even though I 'd had a pretty good education in business administration , even though I was more or less presentable and well-spoken , even though I came from a good family . I made light of it , Sis , I extemporized about Hot Bird , in remarks designed by virtue of my studies in business tactics to drive whole families in for the new low-fat roasters , a meal option that was steeper , in terms of price , but tasty nonetheless . ( And I ought to have known , because I ate from the menu every day . Even the coleslaw . ) <p> Here 's what I 'd say , in my Chicken Mask . Here was my pitch : Feeling a little peckish ? Try Hot Bird ! or Do n't be chicken , try Hot Bird ! The mothers would laugh their nervous adding-machine laughs ( those laughs that are next door over from a sob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty yards away , though , the boys and girls would still be staring disdainfully at me , gaping backward while I rubbed my hands raw in the cold , while I breathed the synthetic rubber interior of the Chicken Mask-that fragrance of rubber balls from gym classes lost , that bouquet of the gloves Mom used for the dishes , that perfume of simpler times-while I looked for my next shill . I lost almost ninety days to the demoralization of the Chicken Mask , to its grim , existential emptiness , until I could n't take it anymore . Which happened to be the day when Alexandra McKinnon ( remember her ? from Sunday school ? ) turned the corner with her boy Zack-he has to be seven or eight now-oblivious while upon her daily rounds , oblivious and fresh from a Hallmark store . It was nearly Valentine 's Day . They did n't know it was me in there , of course , inside the Chicken Mask . They did n't know I was the chicken from the basement , the chicken of darkest nightmares , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guy with some pretty conflicted attitudes about things . That 's how I managed to apprehend Zack , leaping out from the in-door of Cohen 's Pharmacy , laying ahold of him a little too roughly , by the hem of his pillowy , orange ski jacket . Little Zack was laughing , at first , until , in a voice racked by loss , I worked my hard sell on him , declaiming stentoriously that Death Comes to All . That 's exactly what I said , just as persuasively as I had once hawked White meat breasts , eight pieces , just $4.59 ! Loud enough that he 'd be sure to know what I meant . His look was interrogative , quizzical . So I repeated myself . Death Comes to Everybody , Zachary . My voice was urgent now . My eyes bulged from the eyeholes of my standard-issue Chicken Mask . I was even crying a little bit . Saline rivulets tracked down my neck . Zack was terrified . <p> What I got next certainly was n't the kind of flirtatious attention I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me with balled fists . I guess she 'd been standing off to the side of the action previously , believing that I was a reliable paid employee of Hot Bird . But now she was all over me , bruising me with wild swings , cursing , until she 'd pulled the Chicken Mask from my head-half expecting , I 'm sure , to find me scarred or hydrocephalic or otherwise disabled . Her denunciations let up a little once she was in possession of the facts . It was me , her old Sunday school pal , Andrew Wakefield . Not at the top of my game . <p> I do n't really want to include here the kind of scene I made , once unmasked . Alex was exasperated with me , but gentle anyhow . I think she probably knew I was in the middle of a rough patch . People knew . The people leaning out of the storefronts probably knew . But , if things were n't already bad enough , I remembered right then-God , this is horriblethat Alex 's mom had driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardrail and plunged right off that bridge there . In December . In heavy snow . In a Ford Explorer . That was the end of her . Listen , Alex , I said , I 'm confused , I have problems and I do n't know what 's come over me and I hope you can understand , and I hope you 'll let me make it up to you . I ca n't lose this job . Honest to God . Fortunately , just then , Zack became interested in the Chicken Mask . He swiped the mask from his mom-she 'd been holding it at arm 's length , like a soiled rag-and he pulled it down over his head and started making simulated automatic-weapons noises in the directions of local passersby . This took the heat off . We had a laugh , Alex and I , and soon the three of us had repaired to Hot Bird itself ( it closed four months later , like most of the businesses on that block ) for coffee and biscuits and the chefs special spicy wings , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Alex was actually waving a spicy wing when she offered her life-altering opinion that I was too smart to be working for Hot Bird , especially if I was going to brutalize little kids with the creepy facts of the hereafter . What I should do , Alex said , was get into something positive instead . She happened to know a girl-it was her cousin , Glenda-who managed a business over in Albany , the Mansion on the Hill , a big area employer , and why did n't I call Glenda and use Alex 's name , and maybe they would have something in accounting or valet parking or flower delivery , yada yada yada , you know , some job that had as little public contact as possible , something that paid better than minimum wage , because minimum wage , Alex said , was n't enough for a guy of twenty-nine . After these remonstrances she actually hauled me over to the pay phone at Hot Bird ( people are so generous sometimes ) , while my barely alert boss Antonio slumbered at the register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clue that he was about to lose his most conscientious chicken impersonator . All because I could n't stop myself from talking about death . <p> Alex dialed up the Mansion on the Hill ( while Zack , at the table , donned my mask all over again ) , penetrating deep into the switchboard by virtue of her relation to a Mansion on the Hill management-level employee , and was soon actually talking to her cousin : Glenda , I got a fiend here who 's going through some rough stuff in his family , if you know what I mean , yeah , down on his luck in the job department too , but he 's a nice brightguy anyhow . I pretty much wanted to smooch him throughout confirmation classes , and he went to . . . Hey , where did you go to school again ? Went to SUNY and has a degree in business administration , knows a lot about product positioning or whatever , I do n't know , new housing starts , yada yada yada , and I think you really ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several feet away , I swear , through the perfect medium of digital telecommunications , but you ca n't blame Glenda for that . People protect themselves from bad luck , right ? Still , Alex would n't let her cousin refuse , would n't hear of it , You absolutely got ta meet him , Glenda , he sa doll , he sa dream boat , and Glenda gave in , and that 's the end of this part of the story , about how I happened to end up working out on Wolf Road at the capital region 's finest wedding- and party-planning business . Except that before the Hot Bird recedes into the mists of time , I should report to you that I swiped the Chicken Mask , Sis . They had three or four of them . You 'd be surprised how easy it is to come by a Chicken Mask . <p> Politically , here 's what was happening in the front office of my new employer : Denise Gulch , the Mansion on the Hill staff writer , had left her husband and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of the language of the vows-that souffle of exaggerated language-vows which , for quality-control purposes , were being broadcast over a discreet speaker in the executive suite . Denise was so moved by a recitation of Paul Stookey 's " Wedding Song " taking place during the course of the Neuhaus ceremony ( " Whenever two or more of you / Are gathered in His name , / There is love , / There is love . . . " ) that she slipped into the Rip Van Winkle Room disguised as a latecomer . Immediately , in the electrifying atmosphere of matrimony , she began trying to seduce one of the ushers ( Nicky Weir , a part-time Mansion employee who was acquainted with the groom ) . I figure this flirtation had been taking place for some time , but that 's not what everyone told me . What I heard was that seconds after meeting one another-the bride had n't even recessed yet-Denise and Nicky were secreted in a nearby broom closet , while the office phones bounced to voice mail , and were peeling back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at day 's end , scantily clad and intoxicated by rhetoric and desire , they stole a limousine and left town without collecting severance . Denise was even fully vested in the pension plan . <p> All this could only happen at a place called the Mansion on the Hill , a place of fluffy endings : the right candidate for the job walks through the door at the eleventh hour , the check clears that did n't exist minutes before , government agencies agree to waive mountains of red tape , the sky clears , the snow ends , and stony women like Denise Gulch succumb to torrents of generosity , throwing half-dollars to children as they embark on new lives . <p> The real reason I got the job is that they were shorthanded , and because Alex 's cousin , my new boss , was a little difficult . But things were starting to look up anyway . If Glenda 's personal demeanor at the interview was n't exactly warm ( she took a personal call in the middle that lasted twenty-eight minutes , and later she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cologne ) at least she was willing to hire me-as long as I agreed to renounce any personal grooming habits that inclined in the direction of Old Spice , Hai Karate or CK1 . I would have spit-polished her pumps just to have my own desk ( on which I put a yellowed picture of you when you were a kid , holding up the bass that you caught fly-fishing and also a picture of the four of us : Mom and Dad and you and me ) and a Rolodex and unlimited access to stamps , mailing bags and paper clips . <p> Let me take a moment to describe our core business at the Mansion on the Hill . We were in the business of helping people celebrate the best days of their lives . We were in the business of spreading joy , by any means necessary . We were in the business of paring away the calluses of woe and grief to reveal the bright light of commitment . We were in the business of producing flawless memories . We had seven auditoriums , or mrriage suites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slightly different flavor and decorating vocabulary . For example , there was the Chestnut Suite , the least expensive of our rental suites , which had lightweight aluminum folding chairs ( with polyurethane padding ) and a very basic altar table , which had the unfortunate pink and lavender floral wallpaper and which seated about 125 comfortably ; then there was the Hudson Suite , which had some teak in it and a lot of panelling and a classic iron altar table and some rather large standing tables at the rear , and the reception area in Hudson was clothed all in vinyl , instead of the paper coverings that they used in Chestnut ( the basic decorating scheme there in the Hudson Suite was meant to suggest the sea vessels that once sailed through our municipal port ) ; then there was the Rip Van Winkle Room , with its abundance of draperies , its silk curtains , its matching maroon settings of inexpensive linen , and the Adirondack Suite , the Ticonderoga Room , the Valentine Room ( a sort of giant powder puff ) , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its separate kitchen and its enormous fireplace and white-gloved staff , for the sons and daughters of those Victorians of Saratoga County who came upstate for the summer during the racing season , the children of contemporary robber barons , the children whose noses were always straight and whose luck was always good . <p> We had our own on-site boutique for wedding gowns and tuxedo rentals and fittings-hell , we 'd even clean and store your garments for you while you were away on your honeymoon-and we had a travel agency who subcontracted for us , as we also had wedding consultants , jewelers , videographers , still photographers ( both the arty ones who specialized in photos of your toenail polish on the day of the wedding and the conventional photographers who barked directions at the assembled family far into the night ) , nannies , priests , ministers , shamans , polarity therapists , a really maniacal florist called Bruce , a wide array of deejays-guys and gals equipped to spin Christian-only selections , Tex-Mex , music from Hindi films and the occasional death-metal wedding medley-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd even had Dick Roseman 's combo , The Sons of Liberty , do a medley of " My Funny Valentine , " " In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida , " " I Will Always Love You " and " Smells Like Teen Spirit , " without a rest between selections . ( It was gratifying for me to watch the old folks shake it up to contemporary numbers . ) We had a three-story , fifteen-hundred slip parking facility on site , convenient access to I-87 , I-90 and the Taconic , and a staff of 175 full- and part-time employees on twenty-four hour call . We had everything from publicists to dicers of crudites to public orators ( need a brush-up for that toast ? ) - all for the purpose of making your wedding the high watermark of your American life . We had done up to fifteen weddings in a single day ( it was a Saturday in February , 1991 , during the Gulf War ) and , since the Mansion on the Hill first threw open its door for a gala double wedding ( the Gifford twins , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of 1987 , we had performed , up to the time of my first day there , 1,963 weddings , many of them memorable , lifeaffirming , even spectacular ceremonies . We had never had an incidence of serious violence . <p> This was the raw data that Glenda gave me , anyway , Sis . The arrangement of the facts is my own , and in truth , the arrangement of facts constitutes the job I was engaged to perform at the Mansion on the Hill . Because Glenda Manzini ( in 1990 she married Dave Manzini , a developer from Schenectady ) , could n't really have hated her job any more than she did . Glenda Manzini , whose marriage ( her second ) was apparently not the most loving ever in upstate history ( although she 's not alone ; I estimate an even thousand divorces resulting from the conjugal rites successfully consummated so far at my place of business ) , was a cynic , a skeptic , a woman of little faith when it came to the institution through which she made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cattle ; she occasionally referred to the brides as the hookers and to herself , manager of the Mansion on the Hill , as the Madame , as in , The Madame , Andrew , would like it if you would get the hell out of her office so that she can tabulate these receipts , or , Please tell the Hatfields and the McCoys that the Madame can not untangle their differences for them , although the Madame does know the names of some first-rate couples counselors . In the absence of an enthusiasm for our product line or for business writing in general , Glenda Manzini hired me to tackle some of her responsibilities for her . I gave the facts the best possible spin . Glenda , as you probably have guessed , was good with numbers . With the profits and losses . Glenda was good at additional charges . Glenda was good at doubling the price on a floral arrangement , for example , because the Vietnamese poppies absolutely had to be on the tables , because they were so . je ne sais quoi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then auctioning the space to the higher bidder . Glenda was good at quoting a figure for a band and then adding instruments so that the price increased astronomically . One time she padded a quartet with two vocalists , an eight-piece horn section , an African drumming ensemble , a dijeridoo and a harmonium . <p> The other thing I should probably be up-front about is that Glenda Manzini was a total knockout . A bombshell . A vision of celestial loveliness . I hate to go on about it , but there was that single strand of Glenda 's amber hair always falling over her eyes-no matter how many times she tried to secure it ; there was her near constant attention to her makeup ; there was her total command of business issues and her complete unsentimentality . Or maybe it was her stockings , always in black , with a really provocative seam following the aerodynamically sleek lines of her calf . Or maybe it was her barely concealed sadness . I 'd never met anyone quite as uncomfortable as Glenda , but this did n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicken Mask . <p> Meanwhile , it goes without saying that the Mansion on the Hill was n't a mansion at all . It was a homely cinder-block edifice formerly occupied by the Colonie Athletic Club . A trucking operation used the space before that . And the Mansion was n't on any hill , either , because geologically speaking we 're in a valley here . We 're part of some recent glacial scouring . <p> On my first day , Glenda made every effort to insure that my work environment would be as unpleasant as possible . I 'd barely set down my extra-large coffee with two half-and-halfs and five sugars and my assortment of cream-filled donuts ( I was hoping these would please my new teammates ) when Glenda bodychecked me , tipped me over into my reclining desk chair , with several huge stacks of file material . <p> - Andy , listen up . In April we have an Orthodox Jewish ceremony taking place at 3 P.Nt. in Niagara while at the same time there are going to be some very faithful IslamicAmericans next door in Ticonderoga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contact with one another at any time , understand ? I do n't want any kind of diplomatic incident . It 's your job to figure out how to persuade one of these groups to be first out of the gate , at noon , and it 's your job to make them think that they 're really lucky to have the opportunity . And Andy ? The el-Mohammed wedding , the Muslim wedding , needs prayer mats . See if you can get some from the discount stores . Do n't waste a lot of money on this . <p> This is a good indication of Glenda 's management style . Some other procedural tidbits : she frequently assigned a dozen rewrites on her correspondence . She had a violent dislike for semicolons . I was to double-space twice underneath the date on her letters , before typing the salutation , on pain of death . I was never , ever to use one of those cursive word-processing fonts . I was to bring her coffee first thing in the morning , without speaking to her until she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ibuprofen tablets , preferably the elongated , easy-to-swallow variety . I was never to ask her about her weekend or her evening or anything else , including her holidays , unless she asked me first . If her door was closed , I was not to open it . And if I ever reversed the digits in a phone number when taking a message for her , I could count on my pink slip that very afternoon . <p> Right away , that first A.M. , after this litany of scares , after Glenda retreated into her chronically underheated lair , there was a swell of sympathetic mumbles from my coworkers , who numbered , in the front office , about a dozen . They were offering condolences . They had seen the likes of me come and go . Glenda , however , who keenly appreciated the element of surprise as a way of insuring discipline , was not quite done . She reappeared suddenly by my desk-as if by secret entrance-with a half-dozen additional commands . I was to find a new sign for her private parking space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next fiscal quarter , I was to refill her prescription forbirth-control pills . This last request was spooky enough , but it was n't the end of the discussion . From there Glenda starting getting personal : <p> - Oh , by the way , Andy ? ( she liked diminutives ) What 's all the family trouble , anyway ? The stuff Alex was talking about when she called ? <p> She picked up the photo of you , Sis , the one I had brought with me . The bass at the end of your fishing rod was so outsized that it seemed impossible that you could hold it up . You looked really happy . Glenda picked up the photo as though she had n't already done her research , as if she had left something to chance . Which just did n't happen during her regime at the Mansion on the Hill . <p> - Dead sister , said I. And then , completing my betrayal of you , I filled out the narrative , so that anyone who wished could hear about it , and then we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semipro hockey team . <p> - Crashed her car . Actually , it was my car . Mercury Sable . Do n't know why I said it was her car . It was mine . She was on her way to her rehearsal dinner . She had an accident . <p> Sis , have I mentioned that I have a lot of questions I 've been meaning to ask ? Have I asked , for example , why you were taking the windy country road along our side of the great river , when the four-lanes along the west side were faster , more direct and , in heavy rain , less dangerous ? Have I asked why you were driving at all ? Why I was not driving you to the rehearsal dinner instead ? Have I asked why your car was in the shop for muffler repair on such an important day ? Have I asked why you were late ? Have I asked why you were lubricating your nerves before the dinner ? Have I asked if four G &Ts,; as you called them , before your own rehearsal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed ? Have I asked if there was a reason for you to be so tense on the eve of your wedding ? Did you feel you had to go through with it ? That there was no alternative ? If so , why ? If he was the wrong guy , why were you marrying him ? Were there planning issues that were not properly addressed ? Were there things between you two , as between all the betrothed , that we did n't know ? Were there specific questions you wanted to ask , of which you were afraid ? Have I given the text of my toast , Sis , as I had imagined it , beginning with a plangent evocation of the years before your birth , when I ruled our house like a tyrant , and how with earsplitting cries I resisted your infancy , until I learned to love the way your baby hair , your flaxen mop , fell into curls ? Have I mentioned that it was especially satisfying to wind your hair around my stubby fingers as you lay sleeping ? Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it took me several weeks to get it how I wanted it and that I was in fact going over these words again when the call from Dad came announcing your death ? Have I mentioned - and I 'm sorry to be hurtful on this point-that Dad 's drinking has gotten worse since you left this world ? Have I mentioned that his allusions to the costly unfinished business of his life have become more frequent ? Have I mentioned that Mom , already overtaxed with her own body count , with her dead parents and dead siblings , has gotten more and more frail ? Have I mentioned that I have some news about Brice , your intended ? That his tune has changed slightly since your memorial service ? Have I mentioned that I was out at the crime scene the next day ? The day after you died ? Have I mentioned that in my dreams I am often at the crime scene now ? Have I wondered aloud to you about that swerve of blacktop right there , knowing that others may lose their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road somehow ? Is n't there one road crew that the governor , in his quest for jobs , jobs , jobs , can send down there to make this sort of thing unlikely ? Have I perhaps clued you in about how I go there often now , to look for signs of further tragedy ? Have I mentioned to you that in some countries DWI is punishable by death , and that when Antonio at Hot Bird first explained this dark irony to me , I imagined taking his throat in my hands and squeezing the air out of him once and for all ? Sis , have I told you of driving aimlessly in the mountains , listening to talk radio , searching for the one bit of cheap , commercially interrupted persuasion that will let me put these memories of you back in the canister where you now at least partially reside so that I can live out my dim , narrow life ? Have I mentioned that I expect death around every turn , that every blue sky has a safe sailing out of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mean syllable uttered in my direction seems to intimate the violence of murder that every family seems like an opportunity for ruin and every marriage a ceremony into which calamity will fall and hearts will be broken and lives destroyed and people branded by the mortifications of love ? Is it all right if I ask you all of this ? <p> Still , in spite of these personal issues , I was probably a model employee for Glenda Manzini . For example , I managed to sort out the politics concerning the Jewish wedding and the Islamic wedding ( both slated for the first weekend of April ) , and I did so by appealing to certain aspects of light in our valley at the base of the Adirondacks . Certain kinds of light make for very appealing weddings here in our valley , I told one of these families . In late winter , in the early morning , you begin to feel an excitement at the appearance of the sun . Yes , I managed to solve that problem , and the next ( the prayer mats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special on bathmats that week , and I sent Dorcas Gilbey over to buy six dozen to use for the Muslim families . I solved these problems and then I solved others just as vexing . I had a special interest in the snags that arose on Fridays after 5 P.M. - the groom who on the day of the ceremony was trapped in a cabin east of Lake George and who had to snowshoe three miles out to the nearest telephone , or the father of the bride ( it was the Lapsley wedding ) who wanted to arrive at the ceremony by hydrofoil . Brinksmanship , in the world of nuptial planning , gave me a sense of well-being , and I tried to bury you in the rear of my life , in the back of that closet where I 'd hidden my secondhand golf clubs and my ski boots and my Chicken Mask-never again to be seen by mortal man . <p> One of my front-office associates was a fine young woman by the name of Linda Pietrzsyk , who tried to comfort me during the early weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't ask how to pronounce Linda 's surname . In order to pronounce it properly , you have to clear your throat aggressively . Linda Pietrzsyk did n't like her surname anymore than you or I , and she was apparently looking for a groom from whom she could borrow a better last name . That 's what I found out after awhile . Many of the employees at the Mansion on the Hill had ulterior motives . This marital ferment , this loamy soil of romance , called to them somehow . When I 'd been there a few months , I started to see other applicants go through the masticating action of an interview with Glenda Manzini . Glenda would be sure to ask , Why do you want to work here ? and many of these qualified applicants had the same reply , Because I think marriage is the most beautiful thing and I want to help make it possible for others . Most of these applicants , if they were attractive and single and younger than Glenda , aggravated her thoroughly . They were shown the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snuck through , in this case because Linda managed to conceal her throbbing , sentimental heart beneath a veneer of contemporary discontent . <p> We had Mondays and Tuesdays off , and one weekend a month . Most of our problem-solving fell on Saturdays , of course , but on that one Saturday off , Linda Pietrzsyk liked to bring friends to the Mansion on the Hill , to various celebrations . She liked to attend the weddings of strangers . This kind of entertainment was n't discouraged by Glenda or by the owners of the Mansion , because everybody likes a party to be crowded . Any wedding that was too sparsely attended at the Mansion had a fine complement of warm bodies , as Glenda liked to call them , provided gratis . Sometimes we had to go to libraries or retirement centers to fill a quota , but we managed . These gate crashers were welcome to eat finger food at the reception and to drink champagne and other intoxicants ( food and drink were billed to the client ) , but they had to make themselves scarce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window of opportunity here that was large enough for Linda and her friends . <p> She was tight with a spirited bunch of younger people . She was friends with kids who had outlandish wardrobes and styles of grooming , kids with pants that fit like bedsheets , kids with haircuts that were , at best , accidental . But Linda would dress them all up and make them presentable , and they would arrive in an ancient station wagon in order to crowd in at the back of a wedding . Where they stifled gasps of hilarity . I do n't know what Linda saw in me . I ca n't really imagine . I wore the same sweaters and flannel slacks week in and week out . I liked classical music , Sis . I liked historical simulation festivals . And as you probably have n't forgotten ( having tried a couple of times to fix me up-with Jess Carney and Sally Moffitt ) , the more tense I am , the worse is the impression I make on the fairer sex . Nevertheless , Linda Pietrzsyk decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wedding crashers , and so for a while I learned by immersion of the great rainbow of expressions of fealty . <p> Remember that footage , so often shown on contemporary reality-based programming during the dead first half-hour of prime time , of the guy who vomited at his own wedding ? I was at that wedding . You know when he says , Aw , Honey , I 'm really sorry , and leans over and flash floods this amber stuff on her train ? You know , the shock of disgust as it crosses her face ? The look of horror in the eyes of the minister ? I saw it all . No one who was there thought it was funny , though , except Linda 's friends . That 's the truth . I thought it was really sad . But I was sitting next to a fellow actually named Cheese ( when I asked which kind of cheese , he seemed perplexed ) , and Cheese looked as though he had a hernia or something , he thought this was so funny . Elsewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linda Pietrzsyk also liked to catalogue moments of spontaneous erotic delight on the premises , and these were legendary at the Mansion on the Hill . Even Glenda , who took a dim view of gossiping about business most of the time , liked to hear who was doing it with whom where . There was an implicit hierarchy in such stories . Tales of the couple to be married caught in the act on Mansion premises were considered obvious and therefore uninspiring . Tales of the best man and matron of honor going at it ( as in the Clarke , Rosenberg , Irving , Ng , Fujitsu , Walters , Shapiro or Spangler ceremonies ) were better , but not great . Stories in which parents of the couple to be married were caught-in , say , the laundry room , with the dad still wearing his dress shoes-were good ( Smith , Elsworth , Waskiewicz ) , but not as good as tales of the parents of the couple to be married trading spouses , of which we had one unconfirmed report ( Hinkley ) and of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any story in which the bride or the groom were caught in flagrante with someone other than the person they were marrying was considered astounding ( if unfortunate ) . But we were after some even more unlikely tall tales : any threesome or larger grouping involving the couple to be married and someone from one of the other weddings scheduled that day , in which the third party was unknown until arriving at the Mansion on the Hill , and at which a house pet was present . Glenda said that if you spotted one of these tableaux you could have a month 's worth of free groceries from the catering department . Linda Pietrzsyk also spoke longingly of the day when someone would arrive breathlessly in the office with a narrative of a full-fledged orgiastic reception in the Mansion on the Hill , the spontaneous , overwhelming erotic celebration of love and marriage by an entire suite full of Americans , tall and short , fat and thin , young and old . <p> In pursuit of these tales , with her friends Cheese , Chip , Mick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly appear at my side at a reception and give me the newsBehind the bandstand , behind that scrim , groom reaching under his cousin 's skirts . We would sneak in for a look . But we never interrupted anyone . And we never made them feel ashamed . <p> You know how when you 're getting to know a fellow employee , a fellow team member , you go through phases , through cycles of intimacy and insight and respect and doubt and disillusionment , where one impression gives way to another ? ( Do you know about this , Sis , and is this what happened between you and Brice , so that you felt like you personally had to have the four G &Ts; on the way to the rehearsal dinner ? Am I right in thinking you could n't go on with the wedding and that this caused you to get all sloppy and to believe erroneously that you could operate heavy machinery ? ) Linda Pietrzsyk was a stylish , Skidmore-educated girl with ivory skin and an adorable bump in her nose ; she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father 's periodic drunkenness had not affected his ability to work ; her mother stayed married to him according to some mesmerism of devotion ; her brothers had good posture and excelled in contact sports ; in short , there were no big problems in Linda 's case . Still , she pretended to be a desperate , marriage-obsessed kid , without a clear idea about what she wanted to do with her life or what the hell was going to happen next week . She was smarter than me-she could do the crossword puzzle in three minutes flat and she knew all about current eventsbut she was always talking about catching a rich financier with a wild streak and extorting a retainer from him , until I wanted to shake her . There 's usually another layer underneath these things . In Linda 's case it started to become clear at Patti Wackerman 's wedding . <p> The reception area in the Ticonderoga Room-where walls slid back from the altar to reveal the tables and the dance floor-was decorated in branches of forsythia and wisteria and other flowering vines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a piece of white wicker latticework that I had borrowed from the florist in town ( in return for promotional considerations ) , and sprigs of flowering trees garlanded it , garlanded the spot where Linda was standing . Pale colors haloed her . <p> - Right behind this screen , she said , when I swept up beside her and tapped her playfully on the shoulder , - check it out . There 's a couple falling in love once and for all . You can see it in their eyes . <p> I was sipping a Canadian spring water in a piece of company stemware . I reacted to Linda 's news nonchalantly . I did n't think much of it . Yet I happened to notice that Linda 's expression was conspiratorial , impish , as well as a little beatific . Linda often covered her mouth with her hand when she 'd said something riotous , as if to conceal unsightly dental work ( on the contrary , her teeth were perfect ) , as if she 'd been treated badly one too many times , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she spoke of the couple in question her hand fluttered up to her mouth . Her slender fingertips probed delicately at her upper lip . My thoughts came in torrents : Where are Stig and Cheese and Blair ? Why am I suddenly alone with this fellow employee ? Is the couple Linda is speaking about part of the wedding party today ? How many points will she get for the first sighting of their extra-marital grappling ? <p> Since it was my policy to investigate any and all such phenomena , I glanced desultorily around the screen and , seeing nothing out of the ordinary , slipped further into the shadows where the margins of Ticonderoga led toward the central catering staging area . There was , of course , no such couple behind the screen , or rather Linda ( who was soon beside me ) and myself were the couple and we were mottled by insufficient light , dappled by it , by lavender-tinted spots hung that morning by the lighting designers , and by reflections of a mirrored disco ball that speckled the dance floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Kiss me , Linda Pietrzsyk said . Her fingers closed lightly around the bulky part of my arm . There was an unfamiliar warmth in me . The band struck up some fast number . I think it was " It 's Raining Men " or maybe it was that song entitled " We Are Family , " which played so often at the Mansion on the Hill in the course of a weekend . Whichever , it was really loud . The horn players were getting into it . A trombonist yanked his slide back and forth . - Excuse me ? I said . <p> - Kiss me , Andrew , she said. -I want to kiss you . <p> Locating in myself a long-dormant impulsiveness , I reached down for Linda 's bangs , and with my clumsy hands I tried to push back her blond and strawberry-blond curlicues , and then , with a hitch in my motion , in a stop-time sequence of jerks , I embraced her . Her eyes , like neon , were illumined . <p> - Why do n't you tell me how you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sis . I did n't know what to say . And she went on . There was something about me , something warm and friendly about me , I was n't fortified , she said ; I was n't cold , I was just a good guy who actually cared about other people and you know how few of those there are . ( I think these were her words . ) She wanted to spend more time with me , she wanted to get to know me better , she wanted to give the roulette wheel a decisive spin : she repeated all this twice in slightly different ways with different modifiers . It made me sweat . The only way I could think to get her to quit talking was to kiss her in earnest , my lips brushing by hers the way the sun passes around and through the interstices of falling leaves on an October afternoon . I had n't kissed anyone in a long time . Her mouth tasted like cherry soda , like barbecue , like fresh hay , and because of these startling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sis , was I scared . What was this rank taste of wet campfire and bone fragments that I 'd had in my mouth since we scattered you over the Hudson ? Did I come through this set of coincidences , these quotidian interventions by God , to work in a place where everything seemed to be about love , only to find that I could n't ever be a part of that grand word ? How could I kiss anyone when I felt so awkward ? What happened to me , what happened to all of us , to the texture of our lives , when you left us here ? <p> I tried to ask Linda why she was doing what she was doingbehind the screen of wisteria and forsythia . I fumbled badly for these words . I believed she was trying to have a laugh on me . So she could go back and tell Cheese and Mick about it . So she could go gossip about me in the office , about what a jerk that Wakefield was . Man , Andrew Wakefield thinks there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she was joking , and I was through being the joke , being the Chicken Mask , being the harlequin . <p> -I 'm not doing anything to you , Andrew , Linda said . <p> -I 'm expressing myself . It 's supposed to be a good thing . Reaching , she laid a palm flush against my face . <p> -I know you are n't . . . <p> - So what 's the problem ? <p> I was ambitious to reassure . If I could have stayed the hand that fluttered up to cover her mouth , so that she could laugh unreservedly , so that her laughter peeled out in the Ticonderoga Room . . . But I just was n't up to it yet . I got out of there . I danced across the floor at the Wackerman weddingI was a party of one-and the Wackermans and the Delgados and their kin probably thought I was singing along with " Desperado " by the Eagles ( it was the anthem of the new Mr. and Mrs. Fritz Wackerman ) , but really I was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's best man wanted to give his toast while doing flips on a trampoline , about how Jenny Parmenter wanted live goats bleating in the Mansion parking lot , as a fertility symbol , as she sped away , in her Rolls Cornische , to the Thousand Islands . Boy , I always hated the Eagles . <p> Okay , to get back to Glenda Manzini . Linda Pietrzsyk did n't write me off after our failed embraces , but she sure gave me more room . She was out the door at 5:01 for several weeks , without asking after me , without a kind word for anyone , and I did n't blame her . But in the end who else was there to talk to ? To Marie O'Neill , the accountant ? To Paul Avakian , the human resources and insurance guy and petty-cash manager ? To Rachel Levy , the head chef ? Maybe it was more than this . Maybe the bond that forms between people does n't get unmade so easily . Maybe it leaves its mark for a long time . Soon Linda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties of puddings , often in total silence ; at least this was the habit until we found a new area of common interest in our reservations about Glenda Manzini 's management techniques . This happened to be when Glenda took a week off . What a miracle . I 'd been employed at the Mansion six months . The staff was in a fine mood about Glenda 's hiatus . There was a carnival atmosphere . Dorcas Gilbey had been stockpiling leftover ales for an office shindig featuring dancing and the recitation of really bad marital vows we 'd heard . Linda and I went along with the festivities , but we were also formulating a strategy . <p> What we wanted to know was how Glenda became so unreservedly cruel . We wanted the inside story on her personal life . We wanted the skinny . How do you produce an individual like Glenda ? What is the mass-production technique ? We waited until Tuesday , after the afternoon beer-tasting party . We were staying late , we claimed , in order to separate out the green M &Ms; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had requested bowls of M &Ms; at his reception , excluding any andall green candies . When our fellow employees were gone , right at five , we broke into Glenda 's office . <p> Sis , we really broke in . Glenda kept her office locked when she was n't in it . It was a matter of principle . I had to use my Discover card on the lock . I punished that credit card . But we got the tumblers to tumble , and once we were inside , we started poking around . First of all , Glenda Manzini was a tidy person , which I can admire from an organizational point of view , but it was almost like her office was empty . The pens and pencils were lined up . The in and out boxes were swept clean of any stray dust particle , any scrap of trash . There was n't a rogue paper clip behind the desk or in the bottom of her spotless waste basket . She kept her rubber bands banded together with rubber bands . The files in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old faxes were photocopied so that they would n't disintegrate . The photos on the walls ( Mansion weddings past ) , were nondescript and pedestrian . There was nothing intimate about the decoration at all . I knew about most of this stuff from the moments when she ordered me into that cubicle to shout me down , but this was different . Now we were getting a sustained look at Glenda 's personal effects . <p> Linda took particular delight in Glenda 's cassette player ( it was atop one of the black filing cabinets ) -a cassette player that none of us had ever heard play , not even once . Linda admired the selection of recordings there . A complete set of cut-out budget series : Greatest Hits of Baroque , Greatest Hits of Swing , Greatest Hits of Broadway , Greatest Hits of Disco and so forth . Just as she was about to pronounce Glenda a rank philistine where music was concerned , Linda located there , in a shattered case , a copy of Greatest Hits of the Blues . <p> We devoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconnaissance . And I kept reminding Linda not to get any of the green dye on anything . I repeatedly checked surfaces for fingerprints . I even overturned Linda 's hands ( it made me happy while doing it ) , to make sure they were free of emerald smudges . Because if Glenda found out we were in her office , we 'd both be submitting applications at the Hot Bird of Troy . Nonetheless , Linda carelessly put down her handful of M &Ms,; on top of a filing cabinet , to look over the track listings for Greatest Hits of the Blues . This budget anthology was released the year Linda was born , in 1974 . Coincidentally , the year you too were born , Sis . I remember driving with you to the tunes of Lightnin ' Hopkins or Howlin ' Wolf . I remember your preference for the most bereaved of acoustic blues , the most ramshackle of musics . What better soundtrack for the Adirondacks ? For our meandering drives in the mountains , into Corinth or around Lake Luzerne ? What more lonesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where wolves and bears still come to hunt ? Linda cranked the greatest hits of heartbreak and we sat down on the carpeted floor to listen . I missed you . <p> I pulled open that bottom file drawer by chance . I wanted to rest my arm on something . There was a powerful allure in the moment . I was n't going to kiss Linda , and probably her desperate effort to find somebody to liberate her from her foreshortened economic prospects and her unpronounceable surname would n't come to much , but she was a good friend . Maybe a better friend than I was admitting to myself . It was in this expansive mood that I opened the file drawer at the bottom of one stack ( the J through P stack ) , otherwise empty , to find that it was full of a half-dozen , maybe even more , of those circular packages of birth-control pills , the color-coated pills , you know , those multihued pills and placebos that are a journey through the amorous calendars of women . All unused . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white , yellow , brown or green pills liberated from its package . <p> - Must be chilly in Schenectady , Linda mumbled . <p> Was there another way to read the strange bottom drawer ? Was there a way to look at it beyond or outside of my exhausting tendency to discover only facts that would prop up darker prognostications ? The file drawer contained the pills , it contained a bottle of vodka , it contained a cache of family pictures and missives the likes of which were never displayed or mentioned or even alluded to by Glenda . Even I , for all my resentments , was n't up to reading the letters . But what of these carefully arranged packages of photo snapshots of the Manzini family ? ( Glenda 's son from her first marriage , in his early teens , in a torn and grass-stained football uniform , and mother and second husband and son in front of some bleachers , et cetera . ) Was the drawer really what it seemed to be , a repository for mementos of love that Glenda had now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was the lesson of those secrets ? Merely that concealed behind rage ( and behind grief ) is the ambition to love ? <p> - Somebody 's having an affair , Linda said . - The hubby is coming home late . He 's fabricating late evenings at the office . He 's taking some desktop meetings with his secretary . He 's leaving Glenda alone with the kids . Why else be so cold ? <p> - Or Glenda 's carrying on , said I. <p> - Or she 's polygamous , Linda said , - and this is a completely separate family she 's keeping across town somewhere without telling anyone . <p> - Or this is the boy she gave up for adoption and this is the record of her meeting with his folks . And she never told Dave about it . <p> - Whichever it is , Linda said , - it 's bad . <p> We turned our attention to the vodka . Sis , I know I 've said that I do n't touch the stuff anymore-because of your example- but Linda egged me on . We were listening to music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I felt that Muddy Waters 's loss was my kind of loss , the kind you do n't shake easily , the kind that comes back like a seasonal flu , and soon we were passing the bottle of vodka back and forth . Beautiful , sad Glenda Manzini understood the blues and I understood the blues and you understood them and Linda understood them and maybe everybody understood themin spite of what ethno-musicologists sometimes tell us about the cultural singularity of that music . Linda started to dance a little , there in Glenda Manzini 's office , swiveling absently , her arms like asps , snaking to and fro , her wrists adorned in black bangles . Linda had a spell on her , in Glenda 's anaerobic and cryogenically frigid office . Linda plucked off her beige pumps and circled around Glenda 's desk , as if casting out its manifold demons . I could n't take my eyes off of her . She forgot who I was and drifted with the lamentations of Robert Johnson ( hellhound on his trail ) , and I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Skidmore and became a naiad , a true resident of the Mansion on the Hill , that paradise , but when the song was over the eeriness of our communion was suddenly alarming . I was sneaking around my boss 's office . I was drinking her vodka . All at once it was time to go home . <p> We began straightening everything we had moved-we were really responsible about it-and Linda gathered up the dozen or so green M &Ms; she 'd left on the filing cabinetexcepting the one she inadvertently fired out the back end of her fist , which skittered from a three-drawer file down a whole step to the surface of a two-drawer stack , before hopping and skipping over a cassette box , before free-falling behind the cabinets , where it came to rest , at last , six inches from the northeast corner of the office , beside a small coffee-stained patch of wall-to-wall . I returned the vodka to its drawer of shame , I tidied up the stacks of Brides magazines , I locked Glenda 's office door and I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My framed picture hung over the water fountain between the rest rooms . I wore a bow tie . I smiled broadly and my teeth looked straight and my hair was combed . I could n't be stopped . ) <p> My ambition has always been to own my own small business . I like the flexibility of small-capitalization companies ; I like small businesses at the moment at which they prepare to franchise . That 's why I took the job at Hot Bird-I saw Hot Birds in every town in America , I saw Hot Birds as numerous as post offices or ATMs . I like small businesses at the moment at which they really define a market with respect to a certain need , when they begin to sell their products to the world . And my success as a team player at the Mansion on the Hill was the result of these ambitions . This is why I came to feel , after a time , that I could do Glenda Manzini 's job myself . Since I 'm a little young , it 's obvious that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great with respect to the service we were providing to the Capital Region-but I saw the Mansion on the Hill stretching its influence into population centers throughout the northeast . I mean , why was n't there a Mansion on the Hill in Westchester ? Down in Mamaroneck ? Why was n't there a Mansion on the Hill in the golden corridor of Boston suburbs ? Why no mainline Philly Mansion ? Suffice to say , I saw myself , at some point in the future , having the same opportunity Glenda had . I saw myself cutting deals and whittling out discounts at other fine Mansion locations . I imagined making myself indispensable to a coalition of Mansion venture-capitalists and then I imagined using these associations to make a move into , say , the high-tech or bio-tech sectors of American industry . <p> The way I pursued this particular goal was that I started looking ahead at things like upcoming volume . I started using the graph features on my office software to make pie charts of ceremony densities , cost ratios and so forth , and I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the radio or in the press or through alternative marketing strategies ( I came up with the strategy , for example , of getting various non-affiliated religions-small emergent spiritual movements- to consider us as a site for all their group wedding ceremonies ) . And as I started looking ahead , I started noticing who was coming through the doors in the next months . I became well versed in the social forces of our valley . I watched for when certain affluent families of the region might be needing our product . I would , if required , attempt cold-calling the attorney general of our state to persuade him of the splendor of the Niagara Hall when Diana , his daughter , finally gave the okey-dokey to her suitor , Ben . <p> I may well have succeeded in my plan for domination of the Mansion on the Hill brand , if it were not for the fact that as I was examining the volume projections for November ( one Monday night ) , the ceremonies taking place in a mere three months , I noticed that Sarah Wilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Winkle Room . Just before Thanksgiving . There were no particular notes or annotations to the name on the calendar , and thus Glenda was n't focusing much on the ceremony . But something bothered me . That name . <p> Your Brice McCann , Sis . Your intended . Getting married almost a year to the day after your **30;326;TOOLONG . Getting married before even having completed his requisite year of grief , before we 'd even made it through the anniversary with its floodwaters . Who knew how long he 'd waited before beginning his seduction of Sarah Wilton ? Was it even certain that he had waited until you were gone ? Maybe he was faithless ; maybe he was a two-timer . I had started reading Glenda 's calendar to get ahead in business , Sis , but as soon as I learned of Brice , I became cavalier about work . My work suffered . My relations with other members of the staff suffered . I kept to myself . I went back to riding the bus to work instead of accepting rides . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plots and machinations ; I found myself making connections between things that probably were n't connected and planning involved scenarios of revenge . I knew the day would come when he would be on the premises , when Brice would be settling various accounts , going over various numbers , signing off on the pate selection and the set list of the R &B; band , and I waited for him-to be certain of the truth . <p> Sis , you became engaged too quickly . There had been that other guy , Mark , and you had been engaged to him , too , and that arrangement fell apart kind of fast-I think you were engaged at Labor Day and broken up by M.L.K. 's birthdayand then , within weeks , there was this Brice . There 's a point I want to make here . I 'm trying to be gentle , but I have to get this across . Brice wore a beret . The guy wore a beret . He was supposedly a great cook , he would bandy about names of exotic mushrooms , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . It was always you who did the cooking . It 's true that certain males of the species , the kind who linger at the table after dinner waiting for their helpmeet to do the washing up , the kind who preside over carving of viands and otherwise disdain food-related chores , the kind who claim to be effective only at the preparation of breakfast , these guys are Pleistocene brutes who do n't belong in the Information Age with its emerging markets and global economies . But , Sis , I think the other extreme is just as bad . The sensitive , New Age , beret-wearing guys who buy premium mustards and free-range chickens and grow their own basil and then let you cook while they 're in the other room perusing magazines devoted to the artistic posings of Asian teenagers . Our family comes from upstate New York and we do n't eat enough vegetables and our marriages are full of hardships and sorrows , Sis , and when I saw Brice coming down the corridor of the Mansion on the Hill , with his prematurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mousse , wearing a gray , suede bomber jacket and cowboy boots into which were tucked the cuffs of his black designer jeans , carrying his personal digital assistant and his cell phone and the other accoutrements of his dwindling massage-therapy business , he was the enemy of my state . In his wake , I was happy to note , there was a sort of honeyed cologne . Patchouli , I 'm guessing . It would definitely drive Glenda Manzini nuts . <p> We had a small conference room at the Mansion , just around the corner from Glenda 's office . I had selected some of the furnishings there myself , from a discount furniture outlet at the mall . Brice and his fiancee , Sarah Wilton , would of course be repairing to this conference room with Glenda to do some pricing . I had the foresight , therefore , to jog into that space and turn on the speaker phone over by the coffee machine , and to place a planter of silk flowers in front of it and dial my own extension so that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to wear around , Sis , during inventorying and bill tabulation-it helped with the neck strain and tension headaches that I 'm always suffering withso I affixed this headset and went back to filing , down the hall , while the remote edition of Brice and Sarah 's conference with Glenda was broadcast into my skull . <p> I figure my expression was ashen . I suppose that Dorcas Gilbey , when she flagged me down with some receipts that she had forgotten to file , was unused to my mechanistic expression and to my curt , unfriendly replies to her questions . I waved her off , clamping the headset tighter against my ear . Unfortunately , the signal broke up . It was muffled . I hurriedly returned to my desk and tried to get the forwarded call to transmit properly to my handset . I even tried to amplify it through the speaker-phone feature , to no avail . Brice had always affected a soft-spoken demeanor while he was busy extorting things from people like you , Sis . He was too quietthe better to conceal his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had to sneak around the corner from the conference room and eavesdrop in the old-fashioned way . <p> - We wanted to dialogue with you ( Brice was explaining to Glenda ) , because we wanted to make sure that you were thinking creatively along the same lines we are . We want to make sure you 're comfortable with our plans . As married people , as committed people , we want this ceremony to make others feel good about themselves , as we 're feeling good about ourselves . We want to have an ecstatic celebration here , a healing celebration that will bind up the hurt any marriages in the room might be suffering . I know you know how the ecstasy of marriage occasions a grieving process for many persons , Mrs. Manzini . Sarah and I both feel this in our hearts , that celebrations often have grief as a part of their wonder , and we want to enact all these things , all these feelings , to bring them out where we can look at them , and then we want to purge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this wedding feeling good about themselves , as we 'll be feeling good about ourselves . We want to give our families a big collective hug , because we 're all human and we all have feelings and we all have to grieve and yearn and we need rituals for this . <p> There was a long silence from Glenda Manzini . Then she said : <p> - Can we cut to the chase ? <p> One thing I always loved about the Mansion on the Hill was its emptiness , its vacancy . Sure , the Niagara Room , when filled with five-thousand-dollar gowns and heirloom tuxedos , when serenaded by Toots Wilcox 's big band , was a great place , a sort of gold standard of reception halls , but as much as I always loved both the celebrations and the network of relationships and associations that went with our business at the Mansion , I always felt best in the empty halls of the Mansion on the Hill , cleansed of their accumulation of sentiment , utterly silent , patiently awaiting the possibility of matrimony . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish hopes . But after Brice strutted through my place of employment , after his marriage began to overshadow every other , I found instead a different message inscribed on these walls : Every death implies a guilty party . <p> Or to put it another way , there was a network of subbasements in the Mansion on the Hill through which each suite was connected to another . These tunnels were well-traveled by certain alcoholic janitorial guys whom I knew well enough . I 'd had my reasons to adventure there before , but now I used every opportunity to pace these corridors . I still performed the parts of my job that would assure that I got paid and that I invested regularly in my 401K plan , but I felt more comfortable in the emptiness of the Mansion 's suites and basements , thinking about how I was going to extract my recompense , while Brice and Sarah dithered over the cost of their justice of the peace and their photographer and their Champlain Pentecostal Singers . <p> I had told Linda Pietrzsyk about Brice 's reappearance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had remarked about your fractures and your loss of blood and your hypothermia and the results of your post-mortem blood-alcohol test ; I suppose that I 'd begun to tell her all kinds of things , in outbursts of candor that were followed by equal and opposite remoteness . Linda saw me , over the course of those weeks , lurking , going from Ticonderoga to Rip Van Winkle to Chestnut , slipping in and out of infernal sub-basements of conjecture that other people find grimy and uncomfortable , when I should have been overseeing the unloading of floral arrangements at the loading dock or arranging for Glenda 's chiropractic appointments . Linda saw me lurking around , asked what was wrong and told me that it would be better after the anniversary , after that day had come and gone , and I felt the discourses of apology and subsequent gratitude forming epiglottally in me , but instead I told her to get lost , to leave the dead to bury the dead . <p> After a long excruciating interval , the day of Sarah Danforth Wilton 's marriage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill mists , Sis , and you had now been gone just over one year . I had passed through the anniversary trembling , in front of the television , watching the Home Shopping Network , impulsively pricing cubic zirconium rings , as though one of these would have been the ring you might have worn at your ceremony . You were a fine sister , but you changed your mind all the time , and I had no idea if these things I 'd attributed to you in the last year were features of the you I once knew , or whether , in death , you had become the property of your mourners , so that we made of you a puppet . <p> On the anniversary , I watched a videotape of your bridal shower , and Mom was there , and she looked really proud , and Dad drifted into the center of the frame at one point , and mumbled a strange harrumph that had to do with interloping at an assembly of such beautiful women ( I was allowed on the scene only to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you opened your gifts . At one point you leaned over to Mom , and stage-whispered-so that even I could hear-that your car was a real lemon and that you had to take it to the shop and you did n't have time and it was a total hassle and did she think that I would lend you the Sable without giving you a hard time ? My Sable , my car . Sure . If I had it to do again , I would never have given you a hard time even once . <p> The vows at the Mansion on the Hill seemed to be the part of the ceremony where most of the tinkering took place . I think if Glenda had been able to find a way to charge a premium on vow alteration , we could have found a really excellent revenue stream at the Mansion on the Hill . If the sweet instant of commitment is so singular , why does it seem to have so many different articulations ? People used all sorts of things in their vows . Conchita Bosworth used the songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings ; a futon-store owner from Queensbury , Reggie West , managed to work in material from a number of sitcoms . After a while , you 'd heard it all , the rhetoric of desire , the incantation of commitment rendered as awkwardly as possible ; you heard the purple metaphors , the hackneyed lines , until it was all like legal language , as in any business transaction . <p> It was the language of Brice McCann 's vows that brought this story to its conclusion . I arrived at the wedding late . I took a cab across the Hudson , from the hill in Troy where I lived in my convenience apartment . What trees there were in the system of pavement cloverleafs where Route Seven met the interstate were bare , disconsolate . The road was full of potholes . The lanes choked with old , shuddering sedans . The parking valets at the Mansion , a group of pot-smoking teens who seemed to enjoy creating a facsimile of politeness that involved both effrontery and subservience , opened the door of the cab for me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s the party ? The parking lot was full . We had seven weddings going on at once . Everyone was working . Glenda was working , Linda was working , Dorcas was working . All my teammates were working , sprinting from suite to suite , micromanaging . The whole of the Capital Region must have been at the Mansion that Saturday to witness the blossoming of families , Sis , or , in the case of Brice 's wedding , to witness the way in which a vow of faithfulness less than a year old , a promise of the future , can be traded in so quickly ; how marriage is just a shrink-wrapped sale item , mass-produced in bulk . You can pick one up anywhere these days , at a mall , on layaway . If it does n't fit , exchange it . <p> I walked the main hallway slowly , peeking in and out of the various suites . In the Chestnut Suite it was the Polanskis , poor but generous-their daughter Denise intended to have and to hold an Italian fellow , A.L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were paying for the entire ceremony and rehearsal dinner and inviting the DiPietros to stay with them for the week . They had brought their own floral displays , personally assembled by the arthritic Mrs. Polanski . The room had a dignified simplicity . Next , in the Hudson Suite , in keeping with its naval flavor , cadet Bobby Moore and his high-school sweetheart Mandy Sutherland were tying the knot , at the pleasure of Bobby 's dad , who had been a tugboat captain in New York Harbor ; in the Adirondack Suite , two of the venerable old families of the Lake George regionthe Millers ( owners of the Lake George Cabins ) and the Wentworths ( they had the Quality Inn franchise ) commingled their resort-dependent fates ; in the Valentine Room , Sis , two women ( named Sal and Martine , but that 's all I should say about them , for reasons of privacy ) were to be married by a renegade Episcopal minister called Jack Valance-they had sewn their own gowns to match the cadmium red decor of that interior ; Ticonderoga had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage not memorable in any way at all , and in the Niagara Hall two of Saratoga 's great eighteenthcentury racing dynasties , the Vanderbilt and Pierrepont families , were about to settle long-standing differences . Love was everywhere in the air . <p> I walked through all these ceremonies , Sis , before I could bring myself to go over to the Rip Van Winkle Room . My steps were reluctant . My observations : the proportions of sniffling at each ceremony were about equal and the audiences were about equal and levels of whimsy and seriousness were about the same wherever you went . The emotions careened , high and low , across the whole spectrum of possible feelings . The music might be different from case to case-stately baroque anthems or klezmer rave-ups-but the intent was the same . By 3:00 P.M. , I no longer knew what marriage meant , really , except that the celebration of it seemed built into every life I knew but my own . <p> The doors of the Rip Van Winkle Room were open , as distinct from the other suites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved doors behind myself . I slipped into the bride 's side . The light was dim , Sis . The light was deep in the ultraviolet spectrum , as when we used to go , as kids , to the exhibitions at the Hall of Science and Industry . There seemed to be some kind of mummery , some kind of expressive dance , taking place at the altar . The Champlain Pentecostal Singers were wailing eerily . As I searched the room for familiar faces , I noticed them everywhere . Just a couple of rows away Alex McKinnon and her boy Zack were squished into a row and were fidgeting desperately . Had they known Brice ? Had they known you ? Maybe they counted themselves close friends of Sarah Wilton . Zack actually turned and waved and seemed to mouth something to me , but I could n't make it out . On the groom 's side , I saw Linda Pietrzsyk , though she ought to have been working in the office , fielding calls , and she was surrounded by Cheese , Chip , Mick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delinquents from her peer group . Like some collective organism of mirth and irony , they convulsed over the proceedings , over the scarlet tights and boas and dance belts of the modern dancers capering at the altar . A row beyond these Skidmore halfwits-though she never sat in at any ceremony-was Glenda Manzini herself , and she seemed to be sobbing uncontrollably , a handkerchief like a veil across her face . Where was her husband ? And her boy ? Then , to my amazement , Sis , when I looked back at the S. R. O. audience beyond the last aisle over on the groom 's side , I saw Mom and Dad . What were they doing there ? And how had they known ? I had done everything to keep the wedding from them . I had hoarded these bad feelings . Dad 's face was gray with remorse , as though he could have done something to stop the proceedings , and Mom held tight to his side , wearing dark glasses of a perfect opacity . At once , I got up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exasperated families seated next to me , jostling their knees . As I went , I became aware of Brice McCann 's soft , insinuating voice ricocheting , in Dolby surround-sound , from one wall of the Rip Van Winkle Room to the next . The room was appropriately named , it seemed to me then . We were all sleepers who dreamed a reverie of marriage , not one of us had waked to <p> . see the bondage , the violence , the excess of its cabalistic prayers and rituals . Marriage was oneiric . Not one of us was willing to pronounce the truth of its dream language of slavery and submission and transmission of property , and Brice 's vow , to have and to hold Sarah Wilton , till death did them part , forsaking all others , seemed to me like the pitch of a used-car dealer or insurance salesman , and these words rang out in the room , likewise Sarah 's uncertain and breathy reply , and I rushed at the center aisle , pushing away cretinous guests and cherubic newborns toward my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these words with their intimations of mortality , to tell my parents I should never have let you drive that night , Sis . How could I have let you drive ? How could I have been so stupid ? My tires were bald-I could n't afford better . My car was a death trap ; and I was its proper driver , bent on my long , complicated program of failure , my program of futures abandoned , of half-baked ideas , of big plans that came to nought , of cheap talk and lies , of drinking binges , petty theft ; my car was made for my own death , Sis , the inevitable and welcome end to the kind of shame and regret I had brought upon everyone close to me , you especially , who must have wept inwardly , in your bosom , when you felt compelled to ask me to read a poem on your special day , before you totaled my car , on that curve , running up over the bream , shrieking , flipping the vehicle , skidding thirty feet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seat ( why no seat belt ? ) , snapping your neck , ejecting through the windshield , catching part of yourself there , tumbling over the hood , breaking both legs , puncturing your lung , losing an eye , shattering your wrist , bleeding , coming to rest at last in a pile of mouldering leaves , where rain fell upon you , until , unconsciously , you died . <p> Yet , as I called out to Mom and Dad , the McCann-Wilton wedding party suddenly scattered , the vows were through , the music was overwhelming , the bride and groom were married ; there were Celtic pipes , and voices all in harmony-it was a dirge , it was jig , it was a chant of religious ecstasy-and I could n't tell what was wedding and what was funeral , whether there was an end to one and a beginning to the other , and there were shouts of joy and confetti in the air , and beating of breasts and the procession of pink-cheeked teenagers , two by two , all living the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses and pension plans and social-security checks and grandchildren , and I could n't get close to my parents in the throng ; in fact , I could n't be sure if it had been them standing there at all , in that fantastic crowd , that crowd of dreams , and I realized I was alone at Brice McCann 's wedding , alone among people who would have been just as happy not to have me there , as I had often been alone , even in fondest company , even among those who cared for me . I should have stayed home and watched television . <p> This did n't stop me , though . I made my way to the reception . I shoveled down the chicken satay and shrimp with green curry , along with the proud families of Sarah Wilton and Brice McCann . Linda Pietrzsyk appeared by my side , as when we had kissed in the Ticonderoga Suite . She asked if I was feeling all right . <p> - Sure , I said . <p> - Do n't you think I should drive you home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I said . - Then I 'd be happy to go . <p> And Linda asked : <p> - What 's in the bag ? <p> She was referring to my Wal-Mart shopping bag , Sis . I think the Wal-Mart policy which assets that employees are not to let a customer pass without asking if this customer needs help is incredibly enlightened . I think the way to a devoted customer is through his or her dignity . In the shopping bag , I was carrying the wedding gift I had brought for Brice McCann and Sarah Wilton . I did n't know if I should reveal this gift to Linda , because I did n't know if she would understand , but I told her anyhow . Is this what it 's like to discover , all at once , that you are sharing your life ? <p> - Oh , that 's some of my sister . <p> - Andrew , Linda said , and then she apparently did n't know how to continue . Her voice , in a pair of false starts , oscillated with worry . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to leave . <p> But I did n't leave , Sis . I brought out the most dangerous weapon in my arsenal , the pinnacle of my nefarious plans for this event , also stored in my Wal-Mart bag . The Chicken Mask . That 's right , Sis . I had been saving it ever since my days at Hot Bird , and as Brice had yet to understand that I had crashed his wedding for a specific reason , I slipped this mask over my neatly parted hair , and over the collar of the wash-and-wear suit that I had bought that week for this occasion . I must say , in the mirrored reception area in the Rip Van Winkle Room , I was one elegant chicken . I immediately began to search the premises for the groom , and it was difficult to find him at first , since there were any number of like-minded beret-wearing motivational speakers slouching against pillars and counters . At last , though , I espied him preening in the middle of a small group of maidens , over by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was laughing good-naturedly . When he first saw me , in the Chicken Mask , working my way toward him , I 'm sure he saw me as an omen for his new union . Terrific ! We 've got a chicken at the ceremony ! Poultry is always reassuring at wedding time ! Linda was trailing me across the room . Trying to distract me . I had to be short with her . I told her to go find herself a husband . <p> I worked my way into McCann 's limber and witty reception chatter and mimed a certain Chicken-style affability . Then , when one of those disagreeable conversational silences overtook the group , I ventured a question of your intended : <p> - So , Brice , how do you think your last fiancee , Eileen , would be reacting to your first-class nuptial ceremony today ? Would she have liked it ? <p> There was a confused hush , as the three or four of the secretarial beauties of his circle considered the best way to respond to this thorny question . <p> - Well , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be smiling down on us from above . I 've felt her presence throughout the decision to marry Sarah , and I think Eileen knows that I 'll never forget her . That I 'll always love her . <p> - Oh , is that right ? I said , - because the funny thing is I happen to have her with me here , and . . . <p> Then I opened up the small box of you ( you were in a Tiffany jewelry box that I had spirited out of Mom 's jewelry cache because I liked its pale teal shade : the color of rigor mortis as I imagined it ) held it up toward Brice and then tossed some of it . I 'm sure you know , Sis , that chips of bone tend to be heavier and therefore to fall more quickly to the ground , while the rest of the ashes make a sort of cloud when you throw them , when you cast them aloft . Under the circumstances , this cloud seemed to have a character , a personality . Thus , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he began coughing and wiping the corners of his eyes , dusty with your remains . His consorts were hacking as well , among them Sarah Wilton , his troth . How had I missed her before ? She was radiant like a woman whose prayers have been answered , who sees the promise of things to come , who sees uncertainties and contingencies diminished , and yet she was rushing away from me , astonished , as were the others . I realized I had caused a commotion . Still , I gave chase , Sis , and I overcame your Brice McCann , where he blockaded himself on the far side of a table full of spring rolls . Though I have never been a fighting guy , I gave him an elbow in the nose , as if I were a Chicken and this elbow my wing . I 'm sure I mashed some cartilage . He got a little nosebleed . I think I may have broken the Mansion 's unbroken streak of peaceful weddings . <p> At this point , of course , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom and Eric ) arrived on the scene and pulled me off of Brice McCann . They also tore the Chicken Mask from me . And they never returned this piece of my property afterwards . At the moment of unmasking , Brice reacted with mock astonishment . But how could he have failed to guess ? That I would wait for my chance , however many years it took ? <p> - Andy ? <p> I said nothing , Sis . Your ghost had been in the cloud that wreathed him ; your ghost had swooped out of the little box that I 'd held , and now , at last , you were released from your disconsolate march on the surface of the earth , your march of unfinished business , your march of fixed ideas and obsessions unslaked by death . I would be happy if you were at peace now , Sis , and I would be happy if I were at peace ; I would be happy if the thunderclouds and lightning of Brice and Sarah 's wedding would yield to some warm autumn day in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens . <p> Out in the foyer , where the guests from the Valentine Room were promenading in some of the finest threads I had ever seen , Tom McCarthy told me that Glenda Manzini wanted to see me in her office - before I was removed from the Mansion on the Hill permanently . We walked against the flow of the crowd beginning to empty from each of the suites . Our trudge was long . When I arrived at Glenda 's refrigerated chamber , she did an unprecedented thing , Sis , she closed the door . I had never before inhabited that space alone with her . She did n't invite me to sit . Her voice was raised from the outset . Pinched between thumb and forefinger ( the shade of her nail polish , a dark maroon , is known in beauty circles , I believe , as vamp ) , as though it were an ounce of gold or a pellet of plutonium , she held a single green M &M.; <p> - Can you explain this ? she asked . - Can you tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M &M,; I said . -I think that 's the traditional green color , as opposed to one of the new brighter shades they added in a recent campaign for market share . <p> - Andy , do n't try to amuse me . What was this green M &M; doing behind my filing cabinet ? <p> - Well , I <p> -I 'm certain that I did n't leave a green M &M; back there . I would never leave an M &M; behind a filing cabinet . In fact , I would never allow a green M &M; into this office in the first place . <p> - That was months ago . <p> -I 've been holding on to it for months , Glenda said . - Do you think I 'm stupid ? <p> - On the contrary , I said . <p> - Do you think you can come in here and violate the privacy of my office ? <p> -I think you 're brilliant , I said . - And I think you 're very sad . And I think you should surrender your job to someone who cares for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had let go of you , Sis , now that I had begun to compose this narrative in which I relinquished the hem of your spectral bedsheet , I saw through the language of business , the rhetoric of hypocrisy . Why had she sent me out for those birth-control pills ? Why did she make me schedule her chiropractic appointments ? Because she could . But what could n't be controlled , what could never be controlled , was the outcome of devotion . Glenda 's expression , for the first time on record , was stunned . She launched into impassioned colloquy about how the Mansion on the Hill was supposed to be a refuge , and how , with my antics , as she called them , I had sullied the reputation of the Mansion and endangered its business plan , and how it was clear that assault:ng strangers while wearing a rubber mask is the kind of activity that proves you are an unstable person , and I just think , well , I do n't see the point in discussing it with you anymore and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you want to be part of regular human society , and so forth , which is just plain bunk , as far as I 'm concerned . It 's not as if Brice McCann were a stranger to me . <p> I 'm always the object of tirades by my supervisors , for overstepping my position , for lying , for wanting too much-this is one of the deep receivables on the balance sheet of my life and yet at the last second Glenda Manzini did n't fire me . According to shrewd managerial strategy , she simply waved toward the door . With the Mansion crowded to capacity now , with volume creeping upward in the coming months , they would need someone with my skills . To validate the cars in the parking lot , for example . Mark my words , Sis , parking validation will soon be as big in the Northeast as it is in the West . <p> When the McCarthys flung me through the main doors , Linda Pietrzsyk was waiting . What unfathomable kindness . At the main entrance , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice-flingers . Bouquets drifted through the skies to the mademoiselles of the Capital . Garters fell into the hands of local bachelors . Then I was beyond all good news and seated in the passenger seat of Linda 's battered Volkswagen . She was crying . We progressed slowly along back roads . I had been given chances and had squandered them . I had done my best to love , Sis . I had loved you , and you were gone . In Linda 's car , at dusk , we sped along the very road where you took your final drive . Could Linda have known ? Your true resting place is forested by white birches , they dot the length of that winding lane , the fingers of the dead reaching up through burdens of snow to impart much-needed instruction to the living . In intermittent afternoon light , in seizure-inducing light , unperturbed by the advances of merchandising , I composed a proposal . <p>
