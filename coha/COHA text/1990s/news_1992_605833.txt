<p> Cellular telephones have become just another item of standard business apparel here , like Hermes ties and Gucci wingtips . Sleek imported cars pass rapidly rising shopping centers , office buildings , luxury hotels , sprawling villas  --  evidence of the Chilean economic miracle . <p> But in the slums , poverty and desperation mock Chile 's encouraging economic numbers . Sullen young men loiter on unpaved streets , jobless and angry . Residents say crime and illegal drug use are up . Instead of sleek cars there is the occasional broken-down truck ; instead of villas , a jumble of meager houses . <p> That marked contrast between rich and poor , more visible than ever throughout Latin America , may represent an important threat to the region 's new and still precarious economic and political stability . <p> Nearly two decades of free-market , export-oriented , hold-the-line economic policies have generated growth in Chile . Practically every country in the region is rushing to follow the example , slashing government spending , selling state enterprises , lowering trade barriers and letting the market reign supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast segments of the population are being left behind . The free-market revolution is producing a volatile mix  --  ostentatious new wealth enjoyed by a few , along with deepening poverty suffered by many . <p> Attention was focused on the problem by the failed coup in Venezuela two weeks ago . In the slums of Caracas , many people applauded the rebellious army officers and had bitter contempt for the tough fiscal policies imposed by President Carlos Andres Perez . Even as the overall economy was improving , poor people said , their lot was getting worse . <p> It was Venezuela 's second eruption in three years  --  riots in 1989 against government price hikes led to more than 300 deaths  --  and it put other leaders on notice that not even economic growth of 9 percent , as Venezuela produced last year , can guarantee social calm . <p> " I think that what happened in Caracas could happen in practically any country in the region , " said Gert Rosenthal , executive secretary of the Santiago-based United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere , " Rosenthal said . " Not so much that there has n't been outright revolt , but that the tensions accompanying such regressive policies do n't explode . " <p> In Argentina , Brazil , Venezuela and other countries , according to the U.N . commission , wealth has become more concentrated . The poor and the working class saw their incomes fall by 15 percent or more in some countries during the 1980s , while the richest 5 percent of the population saw sharp income gains . <p> The tougher fiscal-adjustment policies of the last two years have accentuated that trend , driving more Latin Americans into poverty . While in 1980 about 35 percent of the region 's population was poor , according to U.N . commission researchers , the figure has grown to 40 percent . <p> Chile was the first Latin American nation to take the free-market road , basing its economic reconstruction on developing new exports , especially fresh fruit and other agricultural products . The result has been eight straight years of growth , healthy budget and trade surpluses , low inflation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now , Chile is the first nation in the region to begin efforts to narrow the income gap . Two years after taking over from Gen. Augusto Pinochet , the democratically elected government says it is trying to make good on President Patricio Aylwin 's promise of " growth with equity . " <p> " We decided that we needed to change the behavior of the economic model , " said Deputy Planning Minister Alvaro Garcia . " Certain elements are being kept  --  consistent rules of the game for business , fiscal surpluses . The great change is to introduce equity into the model . " <p> Between a third and a half of all Chileans live in poverty , and 12 percent of the total population lives in what the government calls " extreme poverty , " with a family income of about $ 130 a month . Garcia said he believes the government can eliminate extreme poverty by the turn of the century , although even some other government officials are skeptical . <p> Shortly after taking office in 1990 , the government pushed through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value-added tax , an indirect sales tax . The measures financed a 30 percent increase in social spending . <p> Garcia said the idea has been to focus direct aid on groups that most need it . One new program provides job training and other services for youths who neither work nor attend school . Another is aimed at the nearly 20 percent of Chilean households headed by women . Programs to build affordable housing have been expanded . <p> The government has sought to give unions better standing in their negotiations with employers , support job-creating small businesses and encourage technological advancement that can lead to greater productivity . <p> After two years , reviews are mixed . " I think we have come a long way in housing and education , " said Jorge Leiva , an adviser to Economy Minister Carlos Ominami . " In health , we 've done less . . . . Overall , there is still a segment of the population , much too large , that does not enjoy the fruits of our economic growth . " <p> The government has decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as overall investment in the economy increases . The conservative , free-market philosophy that Pinochet introduced may be modified , but will not be abandoned . <p> Ironically , Leiva , Ominami , Education Minister Ricardo Lagos and several other high-ranking officials are Socialists  --  the government is a broad center-left coalition , and top posts were parceled out among the coalition 's constituent parties . For these former advocates of a planned economy , presiding over one of the least regulated economies in the world has occasioned a bit of soul-searching . <p> " We recognize that it 's useless to try to close yourself off from what 's happening in the rest of the world , " Leiva said . " Rapid redistributions of income have not worked . Poor people at least are getting the trickle-down that the free-market model provides . It has given results . " <p> Some critics , however , challenge the idea that Latin America 's sudden free-market religion will ever offer much comfort to the poor . <p> Gonzalo Martner , who served as planning minister under Socialist president Salvador Allende before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the economy has grown 17 percent in the last three years , poor Chileans have seen their total wealth increase by less than 4 percent . <p> " There are two roads  --  one that the economy is following and one that the poor are following , " Martner said . " This model has not allowed a reduction of poverty . What we need is a redistribution of income through taxes . . . and policies that promote equity , not poverty over here and wealth over there . " <p> Rosenthal noted that to attract foreign investment and encourage the repatriation of funds sheltered abroad by affluent Latin Americans , governments are forced to offer rates of return of 20 percent or more . Chile 's overall tax burden is by some measures the highest in Latin America , but still amounts to just half that of most industrialized nations . " You have to reward the businessmen , and you have to reward them well , " Rosenthal said . <p> Robert Devlin , a senior economist with the U.N . economic commission , argued that Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " either through the vision of their leaders or through the force of events . " The U.N . commission will hold a conference later this year on ways that Latin American nations can keep their free-market orientation but at the same time improve income distribution . <p> " The new Latin American economic model is based on the penetration of international markets , " Devlin said . " That requires levels of skills that are inconsistent with the income gap as it now exists . " <p> The eruption in Venezuela , Devlin said , " shows that it 's a circle . To have fairness you need growth . But to have growth , you need social stability . And to have social stability , you need fairness . "
