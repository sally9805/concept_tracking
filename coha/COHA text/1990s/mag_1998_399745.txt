// WHAT THE DEVIL 'S gotten into Sarah Michelle Gellar ? The eensy blond star of Buffy the Vampire SlayerThe WB 's cultish horror hit-is confined to a hospital gurney , an IV tube stuck in her arm , mid-hissy fit . " Let me go ! " she roars at a team of doctors . " I have to kill all the vampires ! " . But when the cameras stop rolling , the mood stays midnight dark . Gellar 's cranky She snaps at the director , puts off an interview , even inspires her hairdresser to jokingly paste " 666 " on her trailer door . . In that trailer , two days later , a much more angelic Gellar is apologizing . " I had to pee really badly , and no one would let me go . That 's what started the whole thing . See the price you pay for fame ? " The WB is paying for her fame as well . Gellar 's dog-a tiny white fluff ball named Thor-has his own bladder issues and has already ruined one trailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is watching appreciatively as Thor lets loose on some pages from The New York limes . " Good dog ! Right on the paper . " Thor 's 20-year-old mistress is in the odd position of being more famous than her show , thanks to a two-year stint on the soap All My Children and appearances in the recent blockbusters Scream 2 and I Know What You Did Last Summer ( curiously , she played a slayee in both ) . But Buffy is quickly catching up ; ratings have spiked 54 percent in its second year ( the 1997 mid-season replacement was a critical fave but averaged 3.7 million viewers in its first run-about 10 million shy of a Big Four hit ) . Worshipful fans have even cooked up a drinking game , a la " Hi , Bob , " the homage to Bob Newhart : Pound your brew whenever Buffy flashes her bra strap , pound again when she throws a demon against a wall . As of January , The WB could join in the toast . Buffy seamlessly switched from Mondays-where it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting slaughtered by Fox 's Ally McBeal-to Tuesdays , where it leads into the new coming-of-age smash Dawson 's Creek , currently The WB 's highest-rated show . More impressive still , this New Tuesday , as the promos call it , marks a first : The WB is the only network to have successfully added a fresh night ( its fourth ) without losing ratings on existing nights . Buffy and Dawson are a match made in high school heaven . Both reveal miles of midriff . Both delight in mining pop culture-from Russ Meyer camp to Steven Spielberg mainstream . And both boast steamy May-December romancesDawson between a 16-year-old high school dude and his teacher , Buffy between the slayer herself and a 242-year-old vampire named Angel . ( The latter sparked a heated debate at The WB over whether Buffy 's recent deflowering called for a condom : " When you 're losing your virginity to someone who 's been dead for hundreds of years , is there a risk of contracting sexually transmitted disease ? " asks head of programming Garth Ancier . The eventual answer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV for the Oxy set as well as your more ironically inclined 18- to 34-yearolds . And fueled this season by its highest numbers , The Dubba has finally edged past archrival UPN ( averaging a 3.1 Nielsen rating , versus 2.9 ) . " They 're making a lot of noise , " says New York-based media buyer Paul Schulman . " They 're having the best year of any network , and that 's including the Big Four . " But in the fickle TV world , the jury 's still out . Can the three-year-old WB go from netlet to network ? Will it be Fox Redux ... or the DuMont of the ' ' 90s ? GONG ! IT 'S WEDNESDAY morning in the Burbank offices of The WB , and a strange sound echoes through the halls . Gong ! No , it 's not Chuck Barris making a comeback . The gong is the network 's goofy Charlie Chan-ish way of heralding good news . The summoned staffers file into the lobby-about 100 khaki- and sneaker-clad folks-to hear Ancier crow about last night 's ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8.8 last night . I do n't think they 've ever seen that kind of ratingunless it was a live execution . " Forgive the cornball humor : The WB , after all , has spent some serious time on death row . The network ( co-owned by Time Warner-EW 's parent company-and Tribune Broadcasting ) hit the airwaves in 1995 , the same year as UPN . The doomsaying press was already predicting the extinction of broadcast TV , and no one had much confidence in either start-upalthough UPN was generally given the edge , thanks to its chunk of the Star Trek franchise , Voyager , and its affiliate reach . The WB ... well , it had nice commercials . The network 's first season was about as riveting as a VCR manual : a melange of tepid ethnic shows ( including those wacky Wayans Bros. ) and the lame Soap wannabe Muscle . Predictably , Warner Bros. ' network clunked into sixth place and became a late-night punchline-Jay Leno , for one , cracked that Martin Lawrence 's punishment for assault charges was " a year on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokestoon mascot , Michigan J. Frog , and the net 's daft catchphrase , " dubbadubba-dubba UB , " which the receptionist still blurts out when answering the phone ( " They like to hire people who stutter , " cracks WB star Carol Leifer , creator of the Seinfeldian Alright Already ) . What a difference an identity makes-even if it is a hand-medown . The WB looked to Fox circa 1992 for its edgy , young , skin-baring blueprint . Just as that network broke out with Beverly Hills , 90210 and Melrose Place , The WB has combined in-demand writers ( Toy Story scribe Joss Whedon and Screamwriter Kevin Williamson ) , envelope-pushing scripts ( Dawson pleasuring himself to Katie Couric ) , and enough teen idols to fill a shelf of Tiger Beats . Listen to James Van Der Beek ( Dawson himself ) , fresh from a promo trip to Seattle : " There were 5,000 screaming teenage girls going Oh , my God , you rock ! You 're hot ! I love you ! ' I 've never felt more detached from a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of The WB 's honchos migrated from Fox , including CEO Jamie Kellner , 50 , and Ancier , 38 . While one might assume these renegades are wary of having their creation labeled a Fox clone , Kellner welcomes the comparison , noting that like Fox , The WB is being built one night at a time . ( Just do n't look for " When Michigan J. Frog attacks " anytime soon . ) Photograph SLAY , LADY , SLAY : Big-screen efforts by Gellar ( with costar James Marsters ) have boosted Buffy 's ratings bite Photograph HEAD FOR THE HILLS : With Dawson 's Creek ( left ) , The WB hopes to duplicate the steamy ratings success former upstart net Fox had with early hits Beverly Hills , 90210 ( original cast , right ) and Melrose Place // Fox Entertainment Group president Peter Roth applauds The WB 's " very sound strategy " but warns the network " not to get excited too quickly . " Consider these numbers : While The WB has grown at nearly the same pace as Fox ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , total viewership lags behind Rupert Murdoch 's baby at the same age . Demographics are a particular concern , especially as the four-night-aweek WB attempts to expand ( Friday 's a likely candidate for next year ) . " They 've got to broaden their audience , " says Steve Sternberg , a senior partner at TN Media . " The under-25 set does n't watch enough TV to sustain seven nights a week . " Kellner insists his network 's already wrestling that demo bear . While he admits The WB has specifically targeted young female viewers ( a group now coveted by Madison Avenue ) , he 's got his eye on the whole family : " We want to appeal to teens and kids and adults .... Fox would never have put on a show like 7th Heaven . " That drama-starring Stephen Collins as a sternly sweet minister and father of five-has turned into a surprise hit this season , growing 75 percent from its hellishly rated first year . It 's true that unlike anything on Fox , Heaven does portraygasp ! -a totally functional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , " says exec producer Brenda Hampton . " Even our dog is white . " ) Then again , the show is a Spelling production , scores its best numbers with teens , and lured fans with posters of its sultry , pouting adolescent stars . However you dissect the frog 's strategy , it 's off to a good start . Though The WB still gets shrimp-size ratings compared with Big Four sharks , at least they 're growing . As of February sweeps , household ratings have risen an impressive 19 percent for the season . ABC , on the other hand , lost 9 percent , Fox 10 , and NBC 3 . Hollywood 's creative types have taken notice . " Producers are no longer afraid to take their stuff there , " says ICM executive vice president Alan Berger . " They 're anxious to do it . " For this , The WB should build a shrine to Buffy and a monument to Dawson 's Creek-which claimed the title of No. 1 teen show after four episodes . Not even a controversial teacher-student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drum one up-for publicity purposes ) . " Dawson is doing a sanitized version of what 's happening in real life , " says Ancier , referring to the boy-loving Seattle teacher whose antics were recently splashed across the headlines . Meanwhile , the ocean of red ink is receding-at least a bit . Last year , the netlet bled $87 million , down from $98 million in 1996 . That 's a lot of dough , and even The WB 's biggest boosters say it wo n't turn a profit till 2000 . Still , they 're rosy numbers compared with UPN , which reportedly lost $175 million in ' ' 97 . UPN admits it 's lost momentum . Aside from Moesha and a stagnant Voyager , its lineup is pretty bleak . " I came here facing a difficult situation , " says new president Dean Valentine of his buzz-challenged network ( owned by Viacom and ChrisCraft Industries ) . " We have not put on an event show since Star Trek . " UPN is currently No. 1 with African Americans , but Valentine is clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His vision : Target neglected middle Americans with meat-and-taters Roseanne-type fare . Forget about " psycho yuppies from Manhattan " ; instead , woo your average " UPS driver . " Perhaps the UPS crowd will come aboard UPN 's upcoming Love Boat remake , starring Robert Urich . But for now , The WB is busy dissing its rival , perhaps in revenge for past humiliations ( former UPN president Lucie Salhany used to sport a brooch featuring a frog with a stake through its heart ) . " I think we 're going to kick their ass , " Kellner told affiliates recently . UPN is " out of the business , " he later added , a " submerging network . " Last summer , when The WB first kicked its offense into high gear , Kellner aimed his torpedoes at one of UPN 's traditional strengths : affiliates . The WB wooed away seven key UPN stations owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group with an enticing $84 million . " We 're feeling a lot better than we were before the Sinclair deal , " says Warner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unlikely we would break even by 2000 . " All the recent good tidings appear to have calmed one of The WB 's harshest critics : Time Warner vice chair Ted Erner . Last year he carped to the press about the network 's propensity for hemorrhaging cash , but in January , he sent a conciliatory note to Kellner " Your recent successes ... have not gone unnoticed by me . Congratulations . " Kellner says he " used to throw darts at his picture . Now I 've taken him out of the dartboard . " Turner ( who refused to comment ) might not be breaking out the confetti just yet . The Dubba has a long way to grow-in ratings , demos , and content . Its comedy lineup , in particular , is no laughing matter . Though ethnic sitcoms Smart Guy and Sister , Sister do okay , the network 's broader ( i.e. , white ) comedies-The Tom Show and the promising Alright Alreadylinger in Nielsen hell . Senior VP Jordan Levin offers one strategy : Just as Buffy and Dawson inject punchlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sitcoms . " There 's too many disposable comedies , too many characters you do n't care about , " he says . " We 've got our hit dramas , " adds executive VP Susanne Daniels . " Now we need our Married ... With Children , our Simpsons . " BACK IN THE TRAILER , Gellar is professing her devotion to the network . " I dated the frog for a while , " she reveals . " It did n't work out because of commitment issues . We 're still good friends . " The WB 's ever-faithful poster girl-sneakered feet tucked under her , a blanket spread over her legs-refuses to whine about her net 's far-from-NBC numbers and budgets . " I love being on a cult hit , " she says . " You feel less pressure . And you wo n't get typecast , because you 're not Rachel from Friends . " Gellar 's a smooth showbiz pro indeed . She 's been at this thing a lot longer than The WB-since she appeared in a Valerie Harper TV movie at age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children as Kendall Hart , the devious , stepfatherseducing spawn of Susan Lucci 's Erica Kane . Off screen , according to tabloid reports , it was no love match either . " It was n't the easiest of working conditions , " is all Gellar will say . ( That Gellar won a 1995 Daytime Emmy probably did n't help matters with the trophy-challenged Lucci . ) More recently , another report implied that Gellar will pull a Caruso and ditch Buffy . No , insists the actress , who is trying to renegotiate her current deal ( which allows her to squeak by on $30,000 per episode ) . " I love this show . I know it 's launched my movie career . I will absolutely be back next year . " Good thing , for a Buffy-free Buffy would n't quite work . " Sarah 's got that TV-star thing , " says creator Joss Whedon . " When you watch , you feel a kinship . You go through what she goes through . " But her gig as the slayer wo n't prevent her from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dark-haired Gellar will shoot Cruel Inventions , a Dangerous Liaisons update ; and she just guest-voiced on a future episode of King of the Hill , as Bobby 's girlfriend . But she 's most animated discussing a fantasy cameo , one on Dawson 's Creek . It is , after all , created by Williamson , the man responsible for offing Gellar in her two recent big-screen flicks . " When they have the drunk-driving episode , I want to be the kid who 's killed . I 'm obsessed . I will get killed . " Just not in the ratings .
