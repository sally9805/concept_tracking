Making a separate peace wines . // Most country folks are comfortable using medicinal herbs to maintain the health and wellbeing of themselves and of their animals . After a lifetime of living in the city and three years of owning an herb and health-food shop , it was living independently that taught me that I had to radically rethink the way my family practices medicine . We finally moved to the land in January , 1997 . I began studying homeopathy a few months later and had to rely on my scant knowledge of it within weeks . For starters , our first goat developed mastitis when her twin billys were weaned and sold . Since the reason we had a goat was for the milk , the infection was ruining both the goat 's health and our nutrition . Several tubes of the antibiotic the vet had me squirt up into each nipple did little to cure her . Rather than try another trip to town and another round of the medication , I resorted to herbs and homeopathy for a few days . After trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally found that tiny white tablets of Pulsatilla seemed to get her over the mastitis almost miraculously . Then , one hot July evening , we were moving bricks when my daughter , decked out in her swimsuit and hiking boots but sans the leather gloves I had suggested , was stung by a small scorpion . While the remedy Apis Mellifica is commonly suggested for bites and stings of insects and may quell anaphylactic reactions , Lachesis is a more specific remedy for scorpion stings . I had some on hand , gave her one tablet every twenty minutes for an hour , and had her soak her hand in a basin of cool water with a couple of ice cubes in it . Within forty-five minutes , the swelling and pain were gone and the color had returned to normal where she had been bitten . She had no further complaints but did agree to wear gloves in the future . Both one billy kid and my daughter , who came down with food poisoning on one town trip , have benefited from a few tablets of Arsenicum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Medical Mecdanics When the alternative could be a sixty mile round-trip drive to the nearest clinic , vet , or doctor , homeopathy is a valuable asset in the arsenal of every homesteader , both of the two-legged and four-legged variety Developed in the early 1700s as a therapeutic system of medicine by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann , a German physician , homeopathy quickly spread through Europe to India and west to America in 1850 . In the 1800s and early 1900s , four out of ten doctors in the U.S. were trained homeopaths , and there were over one hundred homeopathic hospitals . To this day , the Royal Family in Great Britain relies upon homeopathic physicians . During the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed twenty-two million people worldwide and half a million in this country , the homeopathic remedy Crolatus Horridus , or rattlesnake venom , was responsible for saving the most lives . Medical archives reveal that Crolatus was the remedy of choice given to homeopathic patients , along with Gelsemium and Belladona . It is interesting that in that epidemic , eighty percent of patients treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with homeopathic remedies lived . However , the development of wonder drugs such as penicillin and advances in medical technologies pushed this gentle but effective healing method into the background . Still , homeopathy is more widely used worldwide than our system of allopathic medicine , and is coming back into favor in this country . Homeopathy is based on the philosophy that " like cures like . " By using minuscule or very diluted amounts of a substance that , in its whole , raw form , would make us ill , we can quickly bring into play the body 's own defenses to overcome a challenge There are over two thousand remedies in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia , all taken from nature in some form or another . Most are from vegetable , animal , and mineral sources , and are broken down into minute quantities to stimulate the patient 's own defense and immune functions . This is the only type of medicine in the world that activates the immune system with virtually no damaging side effects or risk of negative reactions . In a process known as trituration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with lactose or sucrose ) are mixed and prepared in FDA-approved homeopathic pharmacies in the U. S. They may then be sold to anyone , without a prescription , and are considered over-thecounter preparations in both this country , Europe , and other parts of the world . The amount of the original substance in a homeopathic medicine is indicated by a number and the letter X , C , or M. For example , a 3X potency means there is one part of the remedy with nine parts of milk lactose or sucrose . The lower the number , the lower the dosage ; the C and M range are considered high dosages and should be administered only by a homeopathic doctor or lay practitioner . Remedies are available in liquid or tincture form , and as tablets or pellets . These may be dissolved under the tongue in a clean mouth fifteen to thirty minutes before and after eating or drinking anything other than water or brushing the teeth . Homeopathic remedies are very inexpensive : a vial of a hundred tablets retails for under six dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Basic Homeopathic First-Aid Kit // Basic Homeopathic First-Aid Kit // <p>
