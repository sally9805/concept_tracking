<p> CHICAGO - With just a few years left until the next century , it 's a good time to crown the most important artist of this one . <p> Picasso or Matisse ? Marcel Duchamp , who virtually created conceptual art ? The pop of Warhol ? Jackson Pollock 's defiant , abstract-expressionism ? <p> Perhaps . But in the blockbuster exhibition of 1995 , which opened here Tuesday and continues through Nov. 26 , the Art Institute of Chicago offers a surprising contender - Claude Monet . <p> Certainly he 's one of art 's great names , but he 's already ranked as one of the crucial painters of the 19th century . His " Impression , Sunrise , " when shown at an 1874 Paris exhibition staged by anti-establishment artists , provided the title for one of the great movements of art history - French impressionism . But that was the 19th century . <p> " If this exhibition does nothing else , it provides an opportunity to recognize the profundity , grace and transcendental gift Monet brought art after the impressionist <p> years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curator of 20th century painting and sculpture , who organized the retrospective " Claude Monet : 1840-1926 . " <p> The show achieves that purpose by featuring entire rooms of the water-lily paintings that Monet began painting in earnest late in his career , once the 20th century had arrived . Since 1883 , he had lived at Giverny , where he cultivated flowers and water lilies - the latter in a pond with a Japanese bridge - that eventually became the focus of his art . <p> As he continued painting water lilies , the colors become more dreamily diffuse and enveloping . And the foreground and background started to meld into one eternal picture-plane of existence . By his heroic final work , he seems to be painting the very aura of water lilies - of beautiful nature , itself - rather than anything specific . <p> These are like pure abstracts . They fit more comfortably next to Mark Rothko 's color-field paintings or even Pollock 's drip-and-pour abstracts than with the work in that 1874 impressionist show . Case closed ; the Art Institute has made its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show 's angle - the Art Institute 's intellectual justification for staging the largest retrospective yet devoted to Monet . The show has 159 works , culled from 66 museums and 37 private collections in 15 countries . It took five years of planning . <p> Monet is a consistent crowd pleaser , of course . His fame was established in the 1880s and has only grown since his death . His notion that the way we see objects is determined by ever-shifting atmospheric changes now seems as natural as nature itself . <p> And his method for depicting what he saw - painting quickly and often outdoors while using short brush strokes that he called " stenographic " - resulted in work that is vividly colorful , vibrant and soothing . <p> For the Art Institute , this show is the latest event in a long relationship with Monet . Early on , the artist 's dealer - Paul Durand-Ruel - actively sought to develop the U.S market for him . Chicago 's elite were hungry for modernism . <p> Invasion begins <p> In 1890 , his U.S. agent showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1891-1893 , Chicagoans Potter Palmer and his wife , Bertha Honore Palmer , purchased 50 Monets from Durand-Ruel , including nine paintings from the " Wheatstack " series . Palmer was an Art Institute trustee , and later left seven of those to the museum . <p> During Chicago 's fabled World 's Columbian Exposition of 1893 , Durand-Ruel 's agent organized a special European-art show that featured five Monets . In 1895 , the dealer organized an American tour of 20 Monet paintings . The Art Institute presented the Chicago stop , for which it claims to be the first museum ever to hold a Monet exhibit . <p> Another museum trustee , Martin Ryerson , visited Monet at Giverny in 1920 and offered to buy for the Art Institute the water-lily murals that eventually were installed at Paris ' Orangerie as a gift by the artist to France . <p> In 1903 , the Art Institute purchased its first Monet painting . It now has 33 paintings and 11 works on paper in its Monet collection , ranking just behind Paris and Boston as a home for Monet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Art Institute has planned for this show - which is exclusive to Chicago - to draw visitors from throughout the U.S. and Canada . It estimates up to 600,000 people will come . Last week , when only museum members could see it , the early-morning line of eager arrivals stretched the equivalent of several blocks . ( Unlike the general public , which must buy tickets in advance for specific starting times , members could just show up to get in . ) <p> Stocked with tie-ins <p> The museum 's multiple gift shops - as well as every other art and book store in town - are well-stocked with everything imaginable that bears a Monet tie-in . One wonders what the artist would have thought of the tote bags and plastic rulers bearing reproductions of his art . At a press luncheon , corporate sponsor Ameritech even distributed Monet phone cards . <p> From a Denverite 's perspective , this marketing mania is a good thing . For the show 's catalog , which you ca n't walk a block in the Windy City without seeing right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilies " on its cover . <p> The painting , which Denver provided for the show and identifies as " The Water Lily Pond , " has a pleasing sense of lushness to it . The pond is as green from the reflections on the water as from the foliage . Yet despite its experimentation with abstraction , it still separates foreground and background . It is easily accessible . <p> Cover says ' Monet ' <p> " It 's like having your child picked to be on the cover of the yearbook , " says Lewis Sharp , Denver Art Museum director . " And it does visually make a beautiful cover - it clearly does say , ' Monet . " ' <p> Stuckey , who says the Art Institute wanted to feature a water-lily painting , was looking for one that had the same dimensions as the catalog cover . " It fit , " he says . <p> The show fills all the second-floor rooms of the Rice Building , one of three that constitute the Art Institute complex . It is a straightforward , chronological presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both prolific and long-lived - he was 86 when he died . More than 2,000 of his oil paintings survive . That means that this exhibit has its omissions , even with 159 pieces . The show is rich enough in landscapes , seascapes and garden scenes to satisfy any Monet lover . But it is not a substitute for a trip to France . <p> Much is magnificent <p> Paris ' Musee Marmotten , which owns " Impression , Sunrise , " will not let it leave France following its 1990 recovery from art thieves . But Stuckey prevailed upon a private collector to lend " Harbor at Le Havre at Night , " another 1872 painting of the same locale under a different sky . And his final masterpiece , the murals at the Orangerie , could not be here - they are glued to the walls . <p> But among the work that is here , much is magnificent . The 8-by-7-foot central panel of the artist 's ambitious , preimpressionist " Luncheon on the Grass " from 1865-66 , which he wanted to submit to the Salon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Europe for the first time by Paris ' Musee d'Orsay . <p> His 1875 " The Stroll , Camille Monet and Her Son Jean ( Woman With a Parasol ) , " from Washington 's National Gallery , reveals how effective an impressionist Monet could be when painting the human figure . It is haunting in the way the artist 's forcefully applied streaks of blue and white around the subject 's face create a sense of movement . <p> Tribute to Japanese art <p> His first wife , Camille , who died in 1879 during a period of abject poverty for the artist , also dominates a delightful 1876 portrait , " Camille Monet in Japanese Costume . " Rendered in an atypically straightforward , pictorial fashion but with a delightful sense of humor , it serves as a tribute to Japanese art . The Art Institute has placed it in a gallery with Japanese prints similar to ones Monet owned . <p> The show excels in its presentation of Monet 's " series " paintings , which are key to understanding the artist 's greatness . Pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he started to paint the same subject at different times under different conditions . There was no one " real " version . <p> There are four paintings and one pencil sketch from his first series , from 1877 , of the smokey Saint-Lazare train station . The seven " Wheatstacks " from 1890-91 , which are reminiscent of gigantic , solitary bran muffins , mostly come from the Art Institute 's own collection . <p> But the one exception is the best - the Minneapolis Institute of Art 's " Wheatstack ( Sun in the Mist ) " reduces the object to a mysterious geometric object in a landscape totally consumed by otherworldly glow . <p> The first of the show 's water lilies was painted in 1897-1899 , when the artist was nearing 60 . Overall , there are 31 water-lily paintings in this retrospective . <p> It is awe-inspiring to watch them get larger , more daring and more abstract - and yet still hold our trust in them as water-lily paintings - as the artist got older and developed vision problems . <p> He eventually underwent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some magnificent examples . A 1920 diptych from Zurich , " Water Lilies ( Evening ) , " makes the lilies seem as much a part of a late-sunset sky as of water . From New York 's Museum of Modern Art comes the triptych " Water Lilies ( Clouds ) , " which conveys a sense of the heavens opening to accept Monet 's water lilies . <p> And while its dominant green color allows 1922 's " Water Lily Garden , " from Pittsburgh 's Carnegie Museum of Art , to seem more rooted on earth than the other two , it still is a long journey toward abstraction from the Denver piece of 1903 . <p> The show collects 16 of the 48 water-lily paintings the artist did between 1903-1908 , first revealing them at a 1909 Paris exhibition that astonished visitors . The catalog quotes a prescient Monet interview from that time about the work : <p> " People who hold forth on my painting conclude that I have arrived at the ultimate degree of abstraction and imagination that can be found in reality . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift , my total absorption in my work , " he says . <p> Passionate attention <p> " I applied paint to these canvases in the same way that monks of old illuminated their books of hours ; they owe everything to the close union of solitude and silence , to a passionate and exclusive attention akin to hypnosis " <p> And despite the crowds and hoopla surrounding this exhibition , many of the people who attend this show will be admiring Monet 's work with equally passionate attention . <p> Special tickets are required for the show .
