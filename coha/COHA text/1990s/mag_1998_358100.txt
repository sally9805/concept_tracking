For the past couple of weeks the international museum world has been getting an increasing attack of the jitters over two works by the Austrian Expressionist artist Egon Schiele ( 1890-1918 ) . Portrait of Wally , 1912 , and Dead City III , 1911 , were part of a large fall show of Schiele 's drawings and paintings at Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art , all on loan from the government-financed Leopold Foundation in Vienna . The two paintings have long been claimed by descendants of Viennese Jewish families from whom the Nazis stole them in the 1930s . Right at the end of the show  --  in fact only hours before the works were to be crated for return to Vienna  --  Manhattan district attorney Robert Morgenthau took the unusual and high-handed step of hitting MOMA with a subpoena that froze the disputed Schieles in New York City until a criminal investigation had determined whose property they are . <P> This was greeted with outrage in Austria and dismay in the U.S. Austrian Culture Minister Elizabeth Gehrer called Morgenthau 's intervention a " heavy blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundations of trust . " It seemed particularly insulting that Morgenthau 's office had behaved as though the present Austrian government , whose conduct in the restitution of art stolen by Nazis after the Anschluss has been impeccable , would stoop to the sort of cover-up deployed by Swiss bankers over their stocks of stolen Jewish gold . <P> The chief claimants to the paintings are Henry Bondi , 76 , a biochemical engineer in Princeton , N.J. , and Rita Reif , a semiretired arts reporter for the New York Times . Wally had belonged to Bondi 's aunt , a Viennese art dealer named Lea Bondi Jaray . Shortly before she fled to London in 1938 , it was seized from her by a Nazi art dealer ; eventually it passed through the hands of the Austrian Gallery and ended up in the collection of Dr. Rudolf Leopold , an ophthalmologist and self-styled art historian and restorer whose Schiele collection is institutionalized today as the Leopold Foundation . Dead City was owned by a relative of Reif 's , a Viennese writer-comedian named Fritz Grunbaum . Nazis confiscated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage through the art market before Leopold bought it from a dealer is not fully clear . <P> Bondi and Reif had asked MOMA to keep the works in New York until the legal title to the pictures was clarified . " The museum , " said Reif , " must make a moral determination on this . " Exactly wrong : the museum 's responsibility for moral issues stops with the works in its own collection . MOMA had a loan contract with the Leopold Foundation to return the works to Vienna as soon as the show closed . Such contracts are , of course , vital to the arrangement of institutional art loans . The free circulation of works of art among museums depends on them . " If we ca n't honor our contracts , it will have the iciest chilling effect on loans , " MOMA 's legal counsel , Stephen Clark , told the New York Times . " Who would lend , knowing that the pictures might not come back ? "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
