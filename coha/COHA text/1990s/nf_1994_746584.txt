I. INTRODUCTION <p> On August 24 , 1993 , President Clinton released his new wetlands protection plan. 1 Entitled , " Protecting America 's Wetlands : A Fair , Flexible , and Effective Approach , " the plan purports to offer an approach that will provide sufficient protection for America 's dwindling wetlands while also being sensitive to the concerns of landowners. 2 As one means of accomplishing this goal , the plan endorses the increased use of mitigation banking. 3 The plan defines mitigation banking as " wetland restoration , creation , or enhancement .... " performed in advance of permitted wetland losses. 4 <p> Environmentalists criticize the federal wetlands protection program as being ineffective5 while the regulated community complains that it is unduly burdensome. 6 Despite their differences , these two groups agree on one point : there are significant problems with the current federal wetlands protection scheme. 7 <p> Many observers feel that mitigation banking has the potential to significantly improve wetland regulation. 8 Many environmentalists are skeptical , however , and fear even more rapid wetland losses if a banking program is adopted. 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to facilitate a comprehensive wetlands policy that is " fair , flexible , and effective . " Section II provides a backdrop for the mitigation banking issue . It begins with a brief look at the history of wetlands management in the United States , including a description of the current regulatory framework governing wetlands protection and the major criticisms it has drawn . Section III frames the issue of mitigation banking , and then presents the arguments that have been advanced for and against mitigation banking . It then examines some existing banking efforts and proposals to illustrate the possible forms a mitigation banking program might take . Part IV analyzes the role government should take in regulating mitigation banking . Part V summarizes and concludes that in certain circumstances , and with certain restrictions , mitigation banking can be a valuable component of a national wetlands policy . II . THE HISTORY OF WETLAND REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES <p> Wetlands perform many important ecological functions. 10 For example , wetlands filter pollution , 11 provide habitat for numerous species of animal and plant life , 12 and provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitally important natural resources is relatively recent. 14 Filling wetlands was not only allowed but encouraged , and much of urban America was once swamp. 15 Many wetlands were also converted to farmland. 16 Such conversions were seen as benefits to society , in that they created productive lands out of perceived wastelands. 17 As a result , over fifty percent of the wetlands in the United States have been destroyed. 18 <p> In the past two decades , wetlands protection has emerged as a central issue in the national environmental agenda. 19 Today , wetlands regulation occurs primarily under section 404 of the Clean Water Act ( CWA ) . 20 Section 404 regulates " discharges " of " dredged or fill material " into waters of the United States. 21 The section 404 program is intended to achieve a goal of " no net loss of wetlands . " 22 <p> According to the section 404(b) ( 1 ) Guidelines developed by the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers ( Corps ) 23 and a 1990 Memorandum of Agreement ( MOA ) 24 between the Corps and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the CWA , 25 the Corps is to follow a sequencing scheme in issuing permits . Under this sequencing scheme , permit applicants must either avoid adverse impacts to wetlands or demonstrate that such impacts are unavoidable. 26 The next step in the sequence requires that applicants minimize unavoidable adverse impacts. 27 Finally , the applicant must perform compensatory mitigation to offset any adverse impacts that occur despite avoidance and minimization. 28 When compensatory mitigation is found necessary , there is a strong regulatory preference for mitigation that is " on-site " and " in-kind. " 29 <p> The section 404 system has drawn criticism from environmentalists and the regulated community alike . Despite the goal of no net loss of wetlands , the nation continues to lose wetlands at an alarming rate. 30 This loss of wetlands may result from the emphasis placed on compensatory mitigation. 31 Compensatory mitigation is ineffective from an ecological perspective , because the science of creating , enhancing , and restoring wetlands is imprecise and unproved. 32 For example , a 1985 study of thirty-two wetland creation projects in Virginia revealed that only nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failure of mitigation efforts on institutional flaws rather than any technical infeasibility of successful mitigation. 34 One such flaw is the lack of oversight of mitigation efforts by the Corps. 35 Often , all that is required before a permit is issued is a mitigation plan approved by the Corps. 36 As a result , some mitigation plans are never actually carried out or even initiated. 37 <p> Even mitigation projects that are initiated often fail because the regulatory agencies lack the resources to adequately monitor them to see if they are succeeding. 38 Even when sites are monitored , there is often no pre-designated party responsible for rectifying the failure. 39 Finally , even successful mitigation efforts are at risk of being degraded in the future because developers are not required to monitor and maintain the sites into the future. 40 <p> Critics view the sequencing scheme as overly rigid and ineffective because it does not consider the ill effects of fragmentation , isolation , and degradation of the wetlands preserved or compensated for on-site. 41 As a result , many mitigation efforts result in degraded and fragmented wetlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wetland mitigation banking offers a solution to some of the problems surrounding government regulation of wetlands . 43 III . MITIGATION BANKING <p> Mitigation banking is not an entirely new concept. 44 Within the last decade , many entities have initiated mitigation banking programs. 45 Currently , the vast majority of mitigation banks are owned and operated by government entities. 46 <p> In general , wetland mitigation banking refers to a system whereby a party creates , restores , enhances , or in some cases preserves wetlands to provide compensatory mitigation in advance of proposed discharges into wetlands. 47 In some cases , the sponsor of the mitigation bank identifies the development activities to be compensated for prior to establishing the bank. 48 In others , the bank sponsor performs the mitigation " speculatively to compensate for as yet unspecified development activities . " 49 <p> The performed mitigation is translated into " credits " according to a pre-arranged valuation methodology. 50 These credits can then be " withdrawn " and used to offset wetlands losses caused by permitted activities for which compensatory mitigation is deemed appropriate by the regulating agency. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mitigation banking as a tool for wetland management has touched off yet another debate over wetlands policy. 52 Proponents feel that mitigation banking is a " creative and innovative way " to achieve the no net loss of wetlands goal , and possibly to produce a net gain , while easing the regulatory burden on private property owners. 53 Opponents contend that mitigation banking will result in even more loss of valuable and unique wetlands. 54 <p> 1 . Arguments in Favor of Mitigation Banking <p> a . Advance Mitigation <p> Proponents of mitigation argue that mitigation banking offers numerous advantages over the current system. 55 One of the main advantages is that mitigation banking results in mitigation being performed in advance of , rather than subsequent to , wetland conversion projects. 56 Advance mitigation has two principal benefits . First , advance mitigation eliminates concerns that once a permit is granted , mitigation may never take place. 57 Under a typical mitigation banking system , mitigation has already been performed by the time a specific project is permitted. 58 <p> The second benefit of advance mitigation is that it eliminates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does occur. 59 Currently , even mitigation efforts that are successfully completed usually take several years to become fully functional. 60 There is often a significant delay between the time an area is deprived of wetland functions and the reintroduction of those functions. 61 Advance mitigation clearly creates the inverse of this situation  --  a short-term wetland surplus  --  because mitigation bank sites could be operational for some time before credits are withdrawn. 62 <p> b . Consolidated and Large-Scale Mitigation Projects <p> Advocates also cite the possibility of consolidated , large-scale mitigation efforts as one of the primary advantages of mitigation banking over the current site-specific system. 63 Several benefits are associated with larger mitigation projects . <p> First , proponents argue that significant ecological benefits can result from the consolidation of many smaller , individual , project-specific mitigation efforts. 64 Larger , off-site wetland systems are often more ecologically valuable and successful than smaller wetlands. 65 On-site mitigation , in contrast , often results in small wetland patches that serve limited ecological functions. 66 Impacts from the development often compromise what little value still exists in the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such is often the case when on-site mitigation projects are undertaken in the midst of housing developments and shopping centers. 68 <p> Second , larger systems provide habitat for more types of plant and wildlife species. 69 A greater variety of habitat types and species makes it more likely that a mitigation effort will succeed in the long-term because this allows the site to accommodate changes in the ecosystem. 70 In addition , larger areas are able to support larger populations of individual species in addition to a larger variety of species. 71 This helps to prevent inbreeding effects which may trouble small isolated populations. 72 <p> A third advantage of large-scale mitigation is that it allows for economies of scale . Since the costs of mitigation are usually a function of the mitigation site 's size , 73 large-scale mitigation is significantly more cost-efficient than small-scale , project-specific mitigation. 74 Further , the mitigation bank sponsor is able to afford consultants and technology that are not available to individual developers. 75 Larger mitigation projects are therefore likely to be cheaper and of a higher quality than mitigation projects undertaken on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects. 76 <p> A fourth advantage of consolidating many small mitigation projects into fewer large sites is that consolidation enables enforcing agencies to more effectively monitor mitigation projects and enforce permit conditions while expending fewer resources. 77 When there are fewer sites to oversee , regulators may allocate time to revisit sites and determine if mitigation has been performed and is successful. 78 <p> Finally , and perhaps most importantly , consolidation of mitigation efforts allows for compensatory mitigation which might not otherwise take place. 79 This benefit derives from a combination of the potential size of mitigation banking sites and the fact that mitigation , in a banking system , takes place prior to wetland impacts. 80 Much of the wetlands degradation that takes place results from the cumulative impact of uncompensated fills . Some fills are too small to mitigate on a site-specific basis because of the inefficiency and impracticality of small-scale mitigation. 81 <p> Mitigation banking allows for large mitigation sites to be completed in anticipation of numerous , small-scale fills. 82 When such a small fill takes place , it is no longer valid for the developer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site is already functional . The developer can simply purchase the credits necessary to compensate for the loss. 83 Rather than having to concede that mitigation is impractical , regulatory agencies could require permit applicants to purchase an appropriate number of bank credits for many small fills , such as those authorized under nationwide 26. 84 <p> c . Site Selection Benefits <p> Because mitigation bank sponsors choose bank sites independently of particular projects , they can make siting decisions based on relevant factors , such as availability , size , proximity to possible degrading influences , and regional wetland-function needs . Bank sponsors also have more leeway in terms of the time-frame in which they must choose the site. 85 Project-specific mitigation sites , on the other hand , often must be on-site. 86 Even when off-site mitigation is allowed , the siting process is held captive by the need to find a site immediately. 87 This can result in costly mitigation efforts that are often not located in the most suitable place . <p> d . Benefits to Landowners <p> Landowners , and those who represent them , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for landowner support is probably the hope that a mitigation banking scheme would streamline the wetlands regulatory system. 89 First , landowners and agencies would not have to expend their time and resources on developing and approving many small-scale compensatory mitigation plans. 90 This could take place on a much larger scale for each bank. 91 <p> Second , developers would have a much better idea , at a point much earlier in time , of the likely cost of mitigation for a given development project. 92 These costs would be significantly less than if developers had to perform the mitigation themselves. 93 Finally , the responsibility for long-term maintenance would shift from the hands of the developers , who are ill-equipped to act in that capacity , to the hands of the expert entities managing the banks. 94 <p> e . Mitigation Banking as a Takings Safety Valve <p> Proponents postulate that mitigation banking offers the further benefit of preventing regulatory takings claims under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. 95 The regulatory takings doctrine requires the government to pay just compensation when government actions deprive landowners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this challenge when their regulations restrict property owners ' development plans. 97 <p> The United States Supreme Court held , in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council , that when the effect of a government regulation is to deny a landowner all economically viable use of his property the government must pay the landowner just compensation. 98 The Lucas decision has received a great deal of attention , and many commentators have postulated that it could threaten rigorous environmental regulation. 99 Indeed , wetlands regulation may be particularly susceptible to takings challenges because seventy-five percent of America 's wetlands are privately owned. 100 <p> It should be noted , however , that the Lucas court itself stated that its holding would apply only in " relatively rare situations , " and under " extraordinary circumstances . " 101 An examination of post-Lucas takings cases reveals that these " extraordinary " situations , in which a regulation constitutes a taking , only arise when 1 ) the entire parcel has been deprived of value , 102 and 2 ) the challenged regulation/ restriction is imposed subsequent to the challenger 's acquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonetheless , wetland regulators do need to be cognizant of the possibility that their actions may sometimes constitute takings. 105 <p> The argument that a mitigation banking system can shield regulators from liability under the takings doctrine stems from the assumption that land deemed undevelopable because of wetlands contained thereon remains valuable when such a system is in place. 106 In other words , the argument goes , the very fact that a landowner 's land is a critical wetland confers upon it the value of mitigation credit that can be used to satisfy permitting requirements for other projects. 107 Thus , " degraded wetlands can be restored for credit , low and moderate value wetlands can be enhanced , and high-value wetlands can be preserved . " 108 This theory is an extension of the decision in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City. 109 In refusing to find a taking , the Penn Central court cited the fact that the plaintiff was allowed to transfer the development rights which it was not allowed to use above Penn Central Station to another property. 110 <p> 2 . The Case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mitigation banking system would be a change for the better . The most prevalent concern is that mitigation banking will result in less rigorous stewardship on the part of wetlands regulators. 111 Mitigation banking has been called a " cheap trick " to enable more original wetlands to be degraded in exchange for less valuable compensatory mitigation. 112 <p> The negative public perception of mitigation banking may stem from a belief that wetlands banks provide a justification for easing restrictions on the filling of wetlands. 113 Some regulators have been hesitant to endorse mitigation banking because they might be perceived as being willing to " forego the proper steps in project planning and mitigation. " 114 <p> Opponents fear that developers will exert pressure on permitting agencies to allow the purchase of mitigation credits in place of requiring avoidance. 115 This fear is understandable , considering the historical attitude of the primary permitting agency  --  the Corps  --  that development is more important than wetland protection. 116 <p> A related concern is that mitigation banking will result in a net loss of wetlands. 117 If regulators grant mitigation credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that a net loss will result when developers withdraw these credits to compensate for wetland fills elsewhere. 118 Similarly , while enhancement may result in increased wetlands values , it will not result in more wetlands. 119 Therefore , again , a net loss of wetlands occurs when wetlands enhancement is used as compensatory mitigation. 120 Even restoration and creation of wetlands may not result in replacement of wetlands functions of equal character and quality to those destroyed by development in existing natural wetlands. 121 <p> The fears that mitigation banking will result in a net loss of wetlands seem to focus on concerns about compensatory mitigation itself rather than on mitigation banking . These concerns arise under the present system as well. 122 Mitigation banking , if instituted with the proper safeguards , could actually increase the ecological value of compensatory mitigation. 123 The issue of how best to operate a mitigation banking program is discussed in the next section . B. Types of Banks <p> Wetland mitigation banking has many proponents . But not all of its supporters have the same perception with respect to how mitigation should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted , framers of the program must determine the institutional nature of the banks that will provide mitigation credits. 124 Mitigation banks can take three forms : single-client banks , publicly-sponsored , credit-for-sale banks , and privately-sponsored , credit-for-sale banks. 125 Of course , mitigation banking programs can allow for many types of banks. 126 <p> 1 . Single-Client <p> Most existing banks are initiated and managed by a sponsor for the specific purpose of providing advance mitigation for wetlands degradation resulting from projects undertaken by the same entity  --  single-client banks. 127 The most common example of a program involving single-client agency banks is that in which a transportation agency performs large-scale mitigation to compensate for small linear fills necessitated by its road building projects. 128 The Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act ( ISTEA ) 129 provides for the use of federal funds in facilitating the development of mitigation banks to compensate for wetlands losses caused by highway projects of state departments of transportation ( DOTs ) . 130 Many mitigation banks have been established by state DOTs to compensate , in advance , for wetlands alterations caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsored by private entities. 132 For instance , the Tenneco Laterre Mitigation Bank in Louisiana is a 7,014-acre bank sponsored by Tenneco Oil Company in order to compensate for future oil and gas exploration. 133 <p> 2 . Publicly-Sponsored , Credit-For-Sale Banks <p> Some banks are developed by public or quasi-public entities in order to provide credits which they sell on a non-profit basis to developers. 134 These are usually called " mitigation-fee " or " fee-based " banks , 135 although they have also been referred to as " cooperative " banks. 136 These banks are developed by resource agencies or non-profit environmental groups , and the resultant credits are then sold for a fee. 137 <p> The non-profit organization performs administrative and long-term management functions , but the funding comes from the credit purchasers. 138 The fee is based on the costs of the project , such as acquisition , planning , construction , management , and monitoring , in addition to a moderate profit. 139 The prime example of such a bank is the California State Coastal Conservancy which has sponsored two mitigation banks : Bracut Wetland Mitigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank offers several advantages . First , the entities performing the mitigation are motivated to do so by a desire to protect and enhance wetland values , rather than out of a desire for profit or a desire to receive a permit to fill wetlands elsewhere. 141 Therefore , oversight will not be as difficult because the bank operators and regulatory agencies will desire equally high-quality mitigation. 142 <p> Another advantage is that , in publicly-sponsored , fee-based banks , time and resources can be saved through the consolidation of many functions such as credit-production , oversight , and long-term management of the bank site. 143 In some cases where the bank sponsor is a resource agency , the additional function of project permitting could be added , thereby consolidating basically every function , apart from that of the client , in one entity. 144 <p> There are , however , perceived disadvantages with the fee-based system. 145 Primarily , there are concerns regarding the funding of the mitigation efforts. 146 First , it may be difficult to find non-profit sponsors willing and able to bear the significant costs of mitigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold. 147 Second , although the fees charged per credit are intended to cover the costs of mitigation , it is often difficult to foresee all long-term maintenance costs. 148 The California Coastal Conservancy 's Bracut Marsh Bank , for example , has only recovered thirty-eight percent of the bank 's costs. 149 <p> 3 . Privately-Sponsored , Credit-For-Sale Banks <p> There has been a rising call among mitigation banking supporters to institute a market-based mitigation banking system. 150 Such market-based , or entrepreneurial , 151 banks would be businesses , operating to make profits. 152 Market-based approaches to environmental protection and regulation have received a great deal of attention in recent years. 153 The main attraction of such market-based approaches is that they allow for greater flexibility and efficiency than the strict regulatory approach. 154 <p> Generally , market-based approaches to environmental regulation create a market for the right to conduct regulated activities. 155 Specifically , in the wetlands context , a marketable mitigation credit system would involve the creation of mitigation banks by private entrepreneurs who recognize the existence of a market for credits that could be produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this . One benefit is that market forces would theoretically ensure that wetlands mitigation credits would be provided at the least cost. 157 Also , it is argued that the quality of mitigation would improve because market participants would have incentive to ensure the highest possible product. 158 This incentive would derive from a desire on the part of credit suppliers not to incur the costs of mitigation failure. 159 <p> IV . FACILITATING EFFECTIVE WETLAND MITIGATION BANKING <p> Market-based , wetland-mitigation banking has the potential to help regulators achieve the national goal of no-net-loss of wetlands more fairly and effectively than the current regulatory scheme. 160 However , the success of mitigation banking depends on the development of regulatory policies which establish and further ecological and economic goals . <p> In developing regulatory policy with regard to mitigation and mitigation banking , policy makers must recognize two fundamental factors . First , regulators actually create the market for mitigation credits through the very exercise of their regulatory functions. 161 If regulators did not require mitigation for wetland loss and degradation resulting from development projects , developers would not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulatory policy which affects the amount or type of mitigation required in a given area necessarily affects the market for mitigation credits . <p> Second , regulators are the only parties involved in a credit market with an intrinsic interest in the long-term value and success of mitigation projects. 162 Private mitigation bankers will desire to realize the highest profits . Presumably , they will achieve this goal through keeping the cost of producing each credit at a minimum and sacrificing the quality of the mitigation. 163 This cost-cutting approach is unlikely to coincide with the goal of achieving high-quality , successful mitigation . Likewise , purchasers of credits will be motivated by a desire to pay as little as possible for those credits , not a desire to ameliorate environmental harms. 164 <p> Consideration of these factors together yields the conclusion that it is incumbent upon regulators to ensure through regulation the solvency and quality of mitigation . But regulators must also recognize that most regulatory activity will affect the market for mitigation credits and the feasibility of establishing mitigation banks . Evidence of the dual consequences environmental and market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Five policy areas deserve particular attention . First , the use of advanced wetlands planning and classification can increase investment certainty for potential bank sponsors , while also providing valuable information regarding sites for and types of mitigation. 166 Second , wetlands classification should supplement , not replace , sequencing in regulating wetland mitigation and mitigation banking . 167 Third , the siting of mitigation banks should take place within the same watershed as anticipated wetland degradation . 168 Fourth , mitigation banking credits should only accrue where mitigation projects replace lost wetland values . 169 Finally , bank credits generally should be awarded only for mitigation which occurs in advance of development projects which will be mitigated through the use of those credits . 170 A. Advanced Identification and Watershed Planning <p> The current scheme of wetlands regulation has been criticized for being protracted and uncertain . 171 Many experts agree that the key to improving wetlands protection in the United States is through the use of planning mechanisms , and that any mitigation banking system should be implemented in the context of a comprehensive wetlands plan . 172 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift away from the project-by-project approach to wetlands protection and management . 173 The project-specific approach inhibits regulators from integrating conservation objectives into the regulation of development . 174 <p> Central to advanced planning and watershed management are the identification , mapping , and preliminary assessment of wetland functions of all the wetlands within each watershed . 175 With this information available , regulators would be able to determine those types of wetlands and wetland functions that are in abundance within certain watersheds and those that are rare . 176 <p> Such knowledge would allow for the classification of wetlands according to their relative values within the watershed . 177 The particular class in which a wetland would fall would hinge on the wetlands 's ecological value and on the difficulty of replacing the wetland functions that would be lost if the wetland were to be destroyed or degraded . 178 <p> In addition to providing regulators with knowledge of the types of wetlands and wetlands functions that exist in particular watershed areas , watershed planning and advanced identification serve to nurture the market for mitigation credits . 179 Establishing restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each watershed would create investment certainty for potential credit suppliers by indicating which types of wetlands would most likely be certified by regulators and purchased by developers . 180 Mitigation bankers would know where , what type , and how much mitigation to undertake within each planning area . <p> Moreover , the information derived from advanced planning could actually lower the costs of undertaking mitigation in addition to maximizing the demand for mitigation. 181 For instance , information regarding the location of previously degraded wetlands would assist bank sponsors in the location of restoration sites . 182 Likewise , sponsors would benefit from information regarding hydrology and the presence of colonizing species in siting both restoration and creation projects . 183 <p> Advanced planning would not only aid the supply side of the mitigation credit market ; it would also be of benefit to the demand side . Planning processes can help permit applicants by identifying abundant wetland types or degraded wetlands within the watershed . 184 This would provide applicants with information regarding which wetlands areas are more likely to be deemed appropriate for off-site mitigation. 185 <p> Advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts . Advance planning and classification are also vital to the establishment of a successful market for mitigation banking credits . Various planning and classification systems are currently available , and others have been proposed . To the extent that they further ecological and economic viability of mitigation and mitigation banking , these systems are desirable . Some of these planning systems , however , subordinate the primary goal of protecting wetland values to the ancillary goal of increasing market certainty , and should not be incorporated into any wetland mitigation banking scheme . <p> 1 . Advanced Planning Under the Clean Water Act <p> While the current wetlands regulatory scheme is often criticized for focusing on specific projects instead of adopting a more comprehensive approach , there is , in fact , a provision in the CWA for advanced identification . 186 Advanced Identification ( ADID ) under the CWA involves the collection of information about wetlands within defined areas . 187 On the basis of this information , EPA and the Corps make a determination as to whether particular wetlands are suitable or unsuitable for development . 188 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developers and bank operators by providing a method for evaluating the likelihood of permit issuance . 189 ADID can also assist regulators and planners by providing a framework for taking a more comprehensive approach to wetlands management . 190 <p> While the ADID process has historically been used only to identify particularly vital wetlands that are inappropriate for fill , there is potential for ADID to play an important role in a more comprehensive watershed management approach . 191 In addition to providing EPA and the Corps with a broader and more comprehensive management perspective , ADID implementation could be delegated to the states . 192 This state involvement could be federally funded with conditions that states adopt comprehensive state wetlands strategies in accordance with EPA guidelines and that these plans be integrated with other management tools such as special area management plans 193 and state certification of Corps permitting decisions . 194 <p> The advantage of expanding the ADID program in conjunction with instituting mitigation banking is that it provides potential credit applicants with valuable information about developable wetlands and about likely sites for mitigation banks . 195 Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporated mitigation banking . 196 The Columbia South Shore Wetlands Management Plan , which involved a survey of 40,000 acres in Oregon , envisioned a general regional permit for mitigation carried out through a mitigation bank . 197 However , this ADID program has been suspended , and the general permit which the Corps had issued in February of 1992 has since been revoked. 198 The abandonment of the Columbia South Shore plan was due to a legal challenge by environmentalists . 199 <p> 2 . Advanced Planning Under the Coastal Zone Management Act <p> Another possible tool for proactively designating wetlands as suitable or unsuitable for fill is the special area management plan ( SAMP ) provided for under the Coastal Zone Management Act ( CZMA ) . 200 <p> These plans apply to discrete and usually relatively small geographic areas . 201 It is often the case that SAMPs are devised in connection with an ADID or a regional permit issued under section 404 of the CWA. 202 <p> SAMPs differ from ADIDs in three significant respects . First , they only apply to " coastal zones . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 204 Secondly , SAMPs are developed by the states , rather than by federal agencies . 205 This allows for better incorporation of state and local concerns . 206 Finally , unlike ADIDs , SAMPs are legally binding , and states may base their coastal permit decisions on them . 207 <p> In addition , the Memorandum of Agreement between the Corps and EPA exempts development projects that are carried out according to SAMPs from the normal sequencing procedure mitigation for wetland losses . 208 This exemption would apply to mitigation banks established in connection with SAMPs. 209 The opportunity to avoid sequencing within the area covered by SAMPs will be attractive to developers . 210 <p> The avoidance of sequencing would also promote the mitigation credit market . Wetland development within areas designated for development could be mitigated through the purchase of mitigation credits . Demand for mitigation credits would rise , thereby increasing investment certainty for bank producers . However , the potential for significant losses of wetland values exists where SAMPs are not truly comprehensive . 211 Therefore , extra care must be taken to ensure that SAMP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecological considerations have been addressed . B. The Combined Role of Sequencing and Wetland Classification in Wetland Mitigation Banking <p> While the primary purpose of regulating development in wetlands is to protect wetland resources , it also affects the demand for mitigation credits . Demand for mitigation banking credits is a function of pressure to develop wetlands and government-imposed compensatory mitigation requirements . 212 Without development pressure , no credit market will develop . 213 Likewise , no market will develop if regulators either always deny permits for wetland development or permit such development without requiring compensatory mitigation. 214 <p> The sequencing approach currently employed in regulating wetland development 215 has significant effects on the credit market , as well as environmental implications . 216 Avoidance of unnecessary wetlands impacts is the purpose of requiring developers to seek to avoid and minimize impacts on wetlands before resorting to compensatory mitigation. 217 <p> Critics denounce the sequencing procedure , arguing that it reduces the demand for permits and credits 218 and discourages entry into the credit-supply market . 219 These critics insist that regulatory reform would facilitate the creation of credit markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and minimization , reformers argue , regulators could increase wetlands values while increasing demand for mitigation credits . 221 <p> Others argue that inconsistency in the permitting process , rather than the sequencing procedure itself , poses the greatest threat to the viability of mitigation credit markets . 222 They argue that if sequencing were always required , a predictable level of demand for mitigation credits by permit applicants whose projects did satisfy sequencing requirements would remain . 223 The elimination of sequencing , on the other hand , would result in higher demand for mitigation credits , but would not substantially increase predictability. 224 The only way sequencing might actually affect the viability of mitigation banking would be if it denied virtually all wetland development . 225 The inference to be made from this argument is that the predictability of demand , not its magnitude , is an essential prerequisite for credit market . 226 <p> The goal of increased predictability is not inconsistent with the goal of greater flexibility in the sequencing process . Advocates of a credit market system view wetlands classification as a solution to both problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach which would , based on the application of various classification criteria , assign each wetland to a particular category . 228 In turn , various levels of regulatory oversight would apply to wetlands within each category . 229 Presumably , stricter oversight would result in stricter application of sequencing and of on-site , in-kind mitigation preferences . 230 <p> The criteria used to classify wetlands should include ecological value , 231 difficulty of mitigating lost wetlands values , 232 and economic and social value of development . 233 <p> The first criterion , ecological value , is a function of the scarcity of and need for the particular wetlands type within the watershed and the potential for future degradation of a wetland even if development of the wetland itself is denied . 234 For example , a small patch of forested swamp bordering a highway on one side and a condominium project on another is unlikely to have great ecological value . This is particularly true if there are many other forested swamps within the same watershed , because it will most likely be degraded in the near future anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not border any adulterative influences possesses significant ecological value , especially if it is the only such pristine stretch of salt marsh in the area . <p> The second classification criterion concerns the difficulty of replacing lost wetlands values through compensatory mitigation. 235 Availability of appropriate mitigation sites within the same watershed and the scientific success rate of replicating or restoring particular types of wetlands are relevant considerations in applying this criterion . <p> The third category concerns the economic and social value of development . 236 Clearly , regulators impose a greater burden on landowners where they prevent potentially lucrative development projects . However , high economic returns on development enable landowners to pay for more mitigation. 237 Consequently , regulators could demand higher ratios of mitigation to degradation  --  mitigation ratios from landowners earning high returns from development than from those receiving smaller returns . <p> If regulators weigh each of these factors carefully in classifying and regulating the development of wetlands , benefits may accrue jointly to the watershed and the credit market . Such a classification system could continue to stress avoidance as being , presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also facilitate the introduction of other considerations into the permitting process , such as the opportunity costs incurred by , and actual relative environmental benefits derived from , the prevention of wetlands development . 239 C. Siting of Wetland Mitigation Banking Efforts <p> Bank sponsors must receive agency approval of the location and physical characteristics of proposed banks . 240 Siting of banks is a critical at 42. component of a mitigation banking program . 241 Generally , mitigation banks should be located within the same watershed as , or at least in close proximity to , the projects they are intended to mitigate . 242 By requiring that banks be located near areas of expected future wetlands development , regulators can help to ensure that wetlands values are not stripped from one watershed and replaced in another . 243 <p> Mitigation banks should also be located in areas where the potential for impacts by present and future land uses is minimized. 244 To protect mitigation bank sites further from future degradation by adjacent land uses , many studies and guidelines recommend that regulators require buffer zones for each bank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 246 Therefore , the more acreage of buffer that regulators require , the higher the price of credits will be . 247 <p> Of course , it is also important that the site chosen for a mitigation bank possesses the appropriate physical characteristics to facilitate compensation for anticipated losses of wetlands values . 248 Therefore , the bank should encompass desirable habitat types for species adversely impacted by development projects . 249 <p> In addition , bank sites must have adequate water sources to support the appropriate type of wetland ecosystem. 250 This is extremely important because , without a sufficient and reliable water supply , the chances of a bank being an ecological success are low . 251 Mitigation plans should also ensure that the use of such a water source does not adversely impact other wildlife resources and habitats . 252 <p> Regulators must consider these ecological factors in determining whether certain sites are appropriate for mitigation bank development . However , more restrictive requirements will result in a premium on suitable mitigation bank sites and will reduce the supply of credits available to the market . 253 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of government specificity and consistency with regard to siting criteria can exacerbate market uncertainty . 254 Bank regulators also should consider these facts in promulgating siting standards and in making bank permitting decisions . D. Allowable Mitigation <p> Related to the issue of bank siting is the type of mitigation which will provide banking credits . Banking credits should only be awarded for mitigation efforts which effectively replace lost wetland values . <p> Restoration is generally considered the most appropriate form of mitigation. 255 Restoration is favored over creation of new wetlands because it is generally considered to be more successful than creation . 256 This results from the fact that preexisting hydrological and wildlife conditions are available to facilitate restoration of wetland values . 257 <p> Restoration is also preferred to enhancement because it only enhances particular wetlands functions , rather than replacing entire wetlands . 258 Moreover , such enhancement often jeopardizes other unenhanced wetland traits . 259 <p> Lastly , " preservation is the most controversial type of mitigation. " 260 The primary argument against allowing preservation of existing wetlands to compensate for the destruction of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a net loss of wetlands results . 261 <p> Others argue , however , that the use of preservation in a mitigation banking system has its advantages . First , it can result in the protection of high-value , difficult-to-replace wetlands that would otherwise be degraded or destroyed in the near future . 262 If preservation is allowed only in conjunction with monitoring and maintenance requirements , wetlands losses that may have occurred otherwise may be avoided . 263 The other advantage offered in favor of preservation is the avoidance of regulatory takings by agencies that prohibit landowners from filling wetlands on their land . 264 Despite these perceived advantages , very few existing mitigation banks are " preservation " banks . 265 <p> Some guidelines and proposals suggest the use of variable mitigation ratios to compensate for the use of less preferred mitigation types . 266 EPA Region IV , for instance , has issued draft guidance which establishes mitigation ratios of 2:1 for restoration , 3:1 for creation , 4:1 for enhancement , and 10:1 for preservation . 267 <p> Regulators should adopt a policy which will result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to development . A different " sequencing " scheme which reflects preferences of compensatory mitigation types may achieve this goal . Restoration of previously degraded wetlands should be presumed to be the only appropriate form of mitigation . The burden should be on bank sponsors who wish to create credits through the initiation of any other type of mitigation to show why restoration is not possible or will not produce the most ecologically beneficial results . <p> Variable credit ratios , such as those advanced by EPA Region IV , 268 should be used to supplement this mitigation type preference system . For example , a bank sponsor can establish that wetlands creation is the best mitigation option in a particular area because no appropriate restoration sites are available . In such a case , regulators should require a higher mitigation credit ratio . Regulators may choose to allow for some flexibility in requiring higher mitigation ratios in appropriate circumstances . Again , however , the burden of showing why higher ratios are not necessary to ensure full replacement of wetland functions should be on the bank sponsor . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring higher mitigation credit ratios for lower-preference mitigation types in most circumstances will result in more effective replacement of lost wetlands values . Providing for some flexibility in the types of mitigation allowable and the level at which mitigation ratios are set will provide bank sponsors with more options for creating mitigation credits . In addition to nurturing the credit market , this flexibility will encourage research and development of more effective mitigation technology . If credit producers know that more effective mitigation will result in lower credit ratios , they will be more likely to invest in seeking to improve mitigation technology . Therefore , both the quality and efficiency of mitigation will improve . E. Advance Mitigation <p> One of the most extolled advantages of wetlands mitigation banking is the fact that mitigation occurs prior to the degradation for which it is compensating . 269 Some proposals , however , advocate relaxation of the requirement that mitigation be completed before credits can be sold . 270 Proponents of such relaxation argue that the requirement of a sizable up-front capital outlay , without the prospect of any return on investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deter potential credit producers from entering the market . 271 <p> Another perceived problem is the disparity that exists between the advance mitigation requirement of mitigation banking and the rather lax temporal requirements associated with on-site , project-specific mitigation efforts . 272 Critics of strict advance mitigation requirements maintain that permit applicants will not be able to pursue the option of purchasing mitigation banking credits because this disparity will drive up the price of credits and that banks will be competitively disadvantaged . 273 <p> The argument that this disparity in regulatory control puts mitigation banking at a disadvantage does not necessarily indicate a need for relaxing advance mitigation requirements for mitigation banks . The problem could be solved just as well by " leveling the playing field " by requiring advance mitigation for on-site mitigation projects as well as for mitigation banking efforts . 274 This is desirable from an ecological point of view as well , since it will reduce the probability of mitigation failure for on-site projects . <p> Advocates of relaxing the advance mitigation requirements offer two general alternative policies to guard against mitigation failure-the main function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resolving the difficulties associated with requiring fully functional wetland mitigation to be in place before allowing the sale of any credits is to require higher mitigation ratios for credits distributed prior to full functional maturity of a mitigation bank . 275 This is similar to the notion of adjusting mitigation ratios according to the type of mitigation performed by a credit producer . 276 Variable mitigation ratios are also an allowable means of providing for credit withdrawal prior to full functional maturity under the EPA/Corps guidance . 277 <p> Another way of protecting against net wetland losses due to mitigation failure is to allow incremental distribution of credits according to the level of wetland functions that have been established . 278 EPA and Corps guidelines provide for such incremental distribution in some cases . 279 However , a credit supplier seeking to distribute credits in advance of fully functional mitigation must " demonstrate that the mitigation has been or will be successful in offsetting project-related impacts . " 280 Requirements regarding financial guarantees , maintenance and monitoring , and assurances for any necessary future remediation can supplement a system which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction , establishment of necessary hydrology , and other initial steps necessary for the establishment of a mitigation bank at least should be completed before credit sales are allowed . 282 <p> By allowing credits to accrue , in certain circumstances , before mitigation projects reach full functional maturity , regulators can relieve some of the risks of investing in mitigation banking projects . Variable mitigation ratios and incremental credit distribution both offer viable means of allowing earlier credit accrual while still protecting against mitigation failure . These options , however , should not be automatically available to potential bank sponsors . Many types of investments require large capital outlays without the prospect of immediate return . Bank sponsors should have to make a showing that requiring advance mitigation would make their specific projects infeasible in order to be eligible for pre-maturity credits . V. CONCLUSION <p> Wetland mitigation banking has the potential to facilitate the realization of the national goal of no-net-loss of wetlands , and perhaps a net gain of wetlands in the future . However , mitigation banking is not a panacea for the regulatory ills that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarming rate . Banking can not succeed in a vacuum , but must be undertaken in conjunction with other regulatory and policy reforms which will allow for a viable credit market while ensuring the ecological integrity of mitigation projects . <p> Watershed planning must replace the project-specific approach now prevalent in the wetland development permitting process . Sequencing should be presumed to govern , but regulators should use wetland classification to provide sufficient flexibility to ensure that mitigation banking is a viable mitigation option where appropriate . In addition , mitigation banking projects should be sited in areas where they are needed and where there are sufficient environmental resources to support them . It is also important for regulators to restrict mitigation which will produce credits to those types of mitigation which will ensure full replacement of lost wetland values . Restoration should be presumed to be the most appropriate form of mitigation . Again , however , there should be sufficient flexibility to allow for other types of mitigation where bank sponsors can demonstrate that they will maximize environmental benefit . Finally , while regulators should generally protect against mitigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incremental credit distribution can serve the same purpose where strict advance mitigation requirements would otherwise prevent the initiation of mitigation banking . Finally , bank credits generally should be awarded only for mitigation which occurs in advance of development projects which will be mitigated through the use of those credits . <p> * Production Editor , 1994-1995 , BOSTON COLLEGE ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS LAW REVIEW .
