In-line muzzleloaders are generating plenty of controversy-but are they any good ? Our expert weighs in // Some folks will tell you that the so-called " in-line " muzzleloading rifle is the best thing to happen to blackpowder shooting since Dan'l Boone was a Boy Scout . Others are n't so sure . Either way , in-lines are a force no one can ignore , and big-name gunmakers are no exception . Just a few short years ago , they snubbed the newfangled blackpowder market ; now they 're reaching for a slice of the pie . Although the origin of in-line muzzleloaders is a matter of some speculation ( I know I was testing and writing about a modern " in-line " rifle as early as the late ' ' 60s ) , these guns take their name from a firing mechanism that is basically integral to-and " in line " with-the barrel . Unlike the prominent external hammer on traditional caplocks and flintlocks , the internal striking mechanism of an in-line is very similar to the firing pin mechanism of a modern boltaction firearm . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable , and their overall streamlined shape blends well with modern stocks and barrels . In fact , some in-lines can easily be mistaken for modern cartridge rifles ; many have synthetic stocks , stainless steel barrels and modern sights , and come ready to be fitted with telescopic sights . All of which raises the hackles of " traditional " shooters who insist that a muzzleloader should look and feel like , well , a muzzleloader-that the newcomers have no sense of history . And it 's true that many , if not most , of the in-line fans harbor no romantic attachment to the long rifles of yore . They 're more comfortable with muzzleloaders that feel and point like the centerfires they grew up with  --  preferably one with a scope . But aesthetics and traditions are n't the buckskinners ' only concern . They also feel that in-line muzzleloaders undermine the special blackpowder hunting seasons . Those early seasons , they say , are intended to compensate for the inherent handicaps of muzzleloading rifles compared with the reliability , convenience , accuracy , range , firepower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new in-lines all but eliminate these handicaps , and that the people who use them are opportunistic " trophy pickers " who are indifferent to muzzleloading tradition and who violate the spirit-if not the letter-of the law . They also say that under no circumstances should trophies taken with modern , scope-sighted muzzleloaders be allowed into the blackpowder record book . Photograph THE MUZZLELOADER LINE-UP ( left to right ) : Knight Hawk MK-85 , Big Bore Express traditional caplock , White Lightning , Thompson/Center Fire Hawk and Remington Model-700. // These are pretty stiff charges , and the in-line supporters counter by pointing out that their rifles still fire one round at a time and take just as long to reload as any other frontloader ; that the convenience and telescopic capability of inlines mean physically and visually handicapped hunters can take advantage of the special seasons and savor the challenge of blackpowder hunting ; and that in-lines are often used during the regular hunting season as well as during the special blackpowder seasons . The arguments of both sides jump from the logical to the emotional , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why I have long assumed a cowardly hands-off position in the debate and timidly tiptoed around the whole issue-and would probably have continued to do so if Remington had n't entered the fray . Remington 's new muzzleloader is not just an in-line design , but a boltaction in-line . After loading powder and ball at the muzzle end , you simply press a percussion cap on the breech-mounted nipple , close the bolt as you would on any other M-700 Remington , engage the side safety and you 're ready to go hunting . Except for the portly barrel ( blue or stainless ) and ramrod , the M-700 muzzleloader looks , feels and points just like any other syntheticstocked M-700 . Given Remington 's considerable resources and expertise , the first question that comes to mind when you shoulder its M-700 in-line is whether the company has solved any of the centuries-old conundrums of blackpowder accuracy . Only a test will tell for sure , so OUTDOOR LIFE set out to compare the new Remington with the other prominent inline models , including rifles by Modern Muzzleloaders ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shooting Systems and Thompson/Center ( makers of wellrespected traditional and in-line muzzleloaders ) . As a wild card , we also added an old-school caplock to our tests : Made by Big Bore Express , this high-quality rifle has the external hammer and octagonal barrel characteristic of traditional rifles , but adds a raised rib to allow scope mounting with Ruger-style rings . Through the Paces The outline of our comparison tests was simple : We leveled the playing field by using rifles of the same caliber ( .50 ) and by shooting a wide range of bullet weights and types , lubricated and sabot encased , in order to give each rifle a chance to prove itself with the bullet it " liked " best . In the end , we used a selection of 11 bullets . All shooting was done from a concrete benchrest at 100 yards , and to make aiming as precise as possible , the rifles were fitted with scopes of more than lOX magnification . The exception was the BBE rifle : It requires a forward-mounted sight , and 9X was the most magnification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired two three-shot groups with each bullet through each rifle , cleaning the bore after every group and snapping a cap to clear and dry the nipple before loading . ( I did the shooting  --  and a hell of a lot of it  --  but if not for the assistance of a technician from OUTDOOR LIFE 's firearms test center , I 'd still be at the range. ) // RiFLE MAKE AND MODEL // Our powder charge in all cases was a 90 grain equivalent load of Pyrodex Select RS propellent-meaning that the charge was equal in volume but not in weight to 90 grains of FFV granulation blackpowder . RWS percussion caps were used throughout . Using a single load in our tests may have benefited some rifles at the expense of others , but working up the single best load for any given rifle and bullet is a time-consuming task and beyond the scope of our investigation . Even so , as the performance chart shows , accuracy was remarkably good . Groups in the two-inch range , of which there were many , indicate potential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bullet that grouped four inches or more are clearly a bad marriage . All shots were chronographed , and the velocities shown on the chart ( along with their respective footpounds energy ) represent the six-shot average . Likewise , the group sizemeasured from the centers of the two widest holes-is the average of the two groups . Averages that included a group measuring one inch or less  --  there were five of them , including one with the BBE traditional rifle-are so noted on the chart . One group , fired with the Thompson/Center Fire Hawk and the 300grain Knight saboted bullet , measured an incredible .670 inches , challenging the accuracy of even targetgrade centerfire rifles . The fourth shot , however , was more than an inch out of the group ( naturally , we had to push it ) . Very often the first two shots of the group were overlapping holes , but the third shot drifted a couple of inches or more . Which points out the loss of accuracy caused by buildup of fouling in the bore . If you want the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , the uniformity of velocity was remarkably good , varying no more than with factoryloaded centerfire ammo ! There were no misfires . How They Fared So what do our tests tell us ? First of all , that modern muzzleloading rifles ( traditional as well as in-line ) and bullets are capable of accuracy very close to that of centerfire hunting rifles , at least out to 100 yards . On the other hand , muzzleloaders ' relatively low velocity and rainbow trajectories mean they do n't have the range of smokeless powder rifles . As for whether in-lines have a distinct advantage over traditional-style muzzleloaders , the answer is " not especially " - certainly not in terms of accuracy . The BBE caplock compared well with the in-line rifles even though it was probably the most handicapped : Its relatively fast 1 in 20 " rate of rifling twist would work better with heavier bullets driven at higher velocities . So there you have it , except for a word of warning : Load only blackpowder or a blackpowder subsitute such as pyrodex in muzzleloading arms ! Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p>
