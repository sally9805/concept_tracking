<p> Two years after President Clinton made universal health coverage his top domestic priority , all that remains of health care reform is the wreckage of his plan in Washington , , one last shot in the hands of California voters . <p> Proposition 186 , brought to the ballot by 1 million signatures in a 10-week campaign last spring , would take steps to overhaul American medicine that even Clinton deemed politically impossible . <p> It would sweep away California 's system of private health insurance , replacing it with one guaranteeing private doctors and hospitals for everyone , paid for by taxes  --  the way it 's done in Canada . It is called a single-payer system , because an elected health commissioner would act as the sole payer of medical bills for all state residents . <p> Backers claim that eliminating health insurers would save $ 11 billion in administrative waste , enough to cover all Californians with a package of benefits more extensive than most have today . <p> " It 's one of those rare issues that touches everyone , " said Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes-on-186 campaign . " It 's a curious coalition of rich white doctors who want to be freed from insurance companies , old people who want security and poor people who want care they are not getting . " <p> Proposition 186 proponents say it would quickly end the nightmare today 's health insurance system has become , providing security and controlling costs with a method that has worked in Canada for 20 years . Critics call it a 180-degree turn toward big government and big taxes , a system that  --  by promising full care at no charge  --  could give hypochondriacs and flake doctors a blank check on the state treasury . <p> But the idea of a government-run health insurance system has triggered a fierce response from business leaders . " Proposition 186 contains something for everybody to hate , " said Kirk West , president of the California Chamber of Commerce , who said the proposed 8.9 percent payroll tax that would pay for the system would choke the state 's nascent economic recovery . <p> Hospital executives fear it would derail efforts to use competition among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We already have single payer in California . It 's Medi-Cal , and it 's been a flat-out disaster for health care providers , " said Michael Gallagher , president of the Hospital Council of Northern California . <p> No matter how Californians feel about Proposition 186 , the November elections promise one thing : a chance to vote on the issue Congress ducked . <p> " California voters saw what failed in Washington , and they are fed up , " said Bill Zimmerman , director of the yes-on-186 campaign . <p> Success for Proposition 186 may also hang on a leap of faith , a willingness to buy into a health care make-over that looks good on paper , works well abroad , but has been little-studied in California and never tried in the United States . <p> Both sides in the debate attempt to make their case with highly speculative economic forecasts . Advocates at the University of California at San Francisco say Proposition 186 is generously funded and will run up a $ 4 billion surplus in its first year . Spectrum Economics , hired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the loss of as many as 300,000 jobs . <p> Economic forecasts aside , Proposition 186 could turn out to be a referendum on California 's experiment with managed care , an increasingly dominant system in which HMOs guide  --  and often restrict  --  access to costly specialists . <p> For the ardent supporters of a Canadian-style health-care system , the long-cherished dream has never been so close to reality , and never so far away . <p> It has won endorsements from the League of Women Voters , Consumers Union and the American Association of Retired Persons , but it is opposed by both Republican Governor Pete Wilson and Democrat challenger Kathleen Brown . <p> But a recent Field Poll found only 20 percent of California voters in favor of Proposition 186 , with 28 percent opposed . Supporters pin hopes on a $ 1.5 million ad campaign to be held in the two weeks before the election  --  when most of the undecideds make their choice . <p> WHAT PROPOSITION 186 WOULD DO <p> SUMMARY <p> Proposition 186 would set up a Canadian-style universal health insurance system throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid set fees by a single , government insurance program financed by taxes . An elected health commissioner would have broad powers to set rates , expand or restrict benefits and pay claims . The plan would take effect January 1996 . <p> WHAT WILL CHANGE ? <p> Health insurance becomes a right for every state resident , and the state becomes everyone 's health insurer . Premiums , deductibles and most co-payments would be abolished  --  replaced by a payroll tax on businesses and income taxes on individuals . Businesses would stop providing health insurance as a paid benefit . Roughly 6 million who currently have no health insurance would be covered . <p> WHAT IS COVERED ? <p> Doctor visits , hospitalization , home health care , long term medical care and mental health would be fully covered if the services are provided in California . Patients would have free choice of doctor and hospital , but may also sign up with group health plans that limit choice . Prescription drugs would be covered for a $ 5 co-payment . Also covered are eye care , preventive dentistry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 90 days of travel . Non-emergency coverage outside California would be limited to amounts set by the Health Commissioner . <p> WHAT IS N'T COVERED ? <p> State retirees who move out-of-state and employees working out-of-state would not be covered . Legislation would be needed to continue their private insurance . Students enrolled in out-of-state schools would not be covered , either . Room and board in nursing homes is not included in the new long-term care benefit . Prescription drugs outside an approved state list are not covered . <p> How much does it cost , and how do we pay for it ? <p> Proponents contend that the entire program would cost $ 101 billion in 1996 , its first year of operation . Planners expect to collect $ 59 billion from existing state and federal programs such as Medicare , Medi-Cal and county-paid health programs . Another $ 46 billion would be raised in new payroll , income and tobacco taxes  --  leaving a projected $ 4 billion surplus . Opponents say the program will run short by $ 11 billion to $ 20 billion in 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Individuals pay a 2.5 percent income tax surcharge , unless their employer agrees to pay it for them . Families making more than $ 500,000 annually would pay an additional 2.5 percent on income above that threshold . A payroll tax , phased in over three years , would be assessed according to the number of employees : 4.4 percent ( 1-9 employees ) ; 6 percent ( 10-24 employees ) ; 7 percent ( 25-49 employees ) ; 8.9 percent ( more than 50 employees ) . Self-employed earnings would not be subject to the payroll tax . There also would be a $ 1 per pack cigaret tax . <p> COST CONTROLS <p> The system would use price controls to contain costs . Medical fees would be set by the health commissioner . Health spending would be restricted to the rate of growth in the state 's economy plus the growth of population . Administrative costs would be capped at 4 percent of total health spending . If spending exceeds revenues , benefits would be reduced or fees such as co-payments could be added .
