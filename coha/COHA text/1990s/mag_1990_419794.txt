Nelson Mandela is trying to sell the idea of negotiations to a generation raised on the " spirit of no compromise . " <p> THE STREETS OF SOWETO , IF YOU TAKE THE people away , are pretty bleak and pretty grim . But this 13aesday , there is a sense of anarchic joy , with a crowd , mainly kids , stretching in both directions farther than the eye can see . Cheering , dancing , people are exchanging the clenched-fist salutes of liberation and showing the colors of their movement in clothes , flags , scraps of paper stapled together . In their tens of thousands , tirelessly , they half jog , half dance the militant toyi-toyi of the African National Congress . <p> Cars , trucks , minibus taxis struggle in low gear to support the people piled onto every available inch of roof and hood surface . Twenty , thirty abreast , four cars side by side , the crowd is an irresistible force on the roads . Suddenly there is a commotion and the crowd does the impossible-it parts-and a light-blue municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel is a comrade , wired beyond the merely manic , his hand fixed on the horn on a headlong ride to freedom . Clenched fists bristle out through the already broken windows . Silhouetted on the roof is a wild youth doing something that looks like a whip dance . <p> Then there is another bus . And another . The crowd erupts . The people know that these buses have been hijacked from the hated state-controlled transport authority , turned into " transports " to be driven around until the gas runs out , then abandoned . Turning state-owned vehicles into transports is a time-honored custom among Soweto youth on high-festival days , and to have hijacked one is a mark of prestige , rather like riding the bull in Spanish street festivals . <p> The youth of Soweto make their own rules . Since their first show of group strength in the riots of 1976 , young people have emerged as the most powerful and unpredictable single force within the country . The townships , where blacks by law are forced to live , belong to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa 's history . After a string of victories  --  the release of detainees , the freeing of the Rivonia prisoners , and the unbanning of the ANC  --  ANC leader Nelson Mandela , after twenty-seven years in prison , had returned in triumph . The freeing of Mandela , after huge national and international campaigns , marked a turning point in the struggle for a free South Africa , and a giant crowd turned out to hear him speak at the Soccer City stadium in Soweto . " I pay tribute , " Mandela had said on his release , " to the endless heroes of youth . You , the Young Lions , have energized our struggle . " <p> But though to be at the rally was to feel as though one was marching triumphant into Havana with Fidel Castro , at the end of the heady day , little had concretely changed . In real life , the demonstration did not represent the victory of the people ; it was merely something tolerated by the authorities . Though the police had stayed out of sight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the day , the people of the new South Africa went back to the old South Africa , the blacks to their matchbox houses in the townships , the whites to white suburbia . The truth was that no more than a new phase in the long struggle for liberation had begun  --  a phase that will be shaped by the next generation of South African freedom fighters . <p> At the homecoming rally , when Mandela reaffirmed his commitment : to the ANC 's armed struggle against the South African state , the crowd roared . There were murmurings of discontent when he said , " All students must return to school and learn . We must continue our struggle for people 's education within the school system . " In another era , it had been the ANC and its supporters who fostered the battle cry of youth : LIBERATION BEFORE EDUCATION ! <p> When Mandela spoke of the long and difficult path to a distant negotiated settlement , few of the youth even seemed to hear . Walter Sisulu , Mandela 's closest comrade and adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last October after twenty-six years in prison . In a January interview , he confided : " The youngsters are not really interested in the prospect of negotiations . In fact : they 've become a little bit angry . This is why I say this chap de Klerk moving tot ) fast can create problems for us . We want : to educate the youth . We want to have time to discuss these issues with them . " <p> The euphoria and the : expectation of overnight change that followed Mandela 's release quickly soured . Within a month , the townships were swept : by waves of youth-led unrest . The authorities met protest with violent reprisal , beating and arresting young activists ; by April , police had shot and killed hundreds of black demonstrators . Hundreds more were killed in fighting in Natal 's war-torn townships , and the " independent " black homelands erupted . Inside other South African townships , taxi wars broke out ; boycotts were called and noncompliers attacked . Hope was turning into disappointment and disappointment into anger . But busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning for negotiations , the ANC seemed all but powerless to prevent : another spell of violent upheaval . <p> Though Mandela 's personal prestige is enormous , it is far from clear that he still represents the aspirations of the majority of his people . At seventy-one , he is an old man and his values are , to a significant degree , those of the quieter , more dignified , less militant world he left behind when imprisoned more than a quarter century ago . <p> Perhaps the most telling moment of the Soweto rally was when the " people 's poet , " Mzwakhe Mbuli , took the microphone . Here , there was no ambivalence . The stands shook . Raptures of applause drowned the poet out , and he had to do encores while Mandela waited in the wings . This was what the youth wanted to hear : a galvanizing call to action . <p> Mbuli is an activist who has been detained , interrogated , and tortured on numerous occasions for months at a stretch . He has been the target of various assassination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lived in borrowed cars and the midnight homes of friends , and today is facing charges related to the possession of explosives . <p> But it is as a performer at mass rallies and political funerals that he has become something like a messiah to the youth of the townships . Mbuli has a voice that rises still steaming from the soul , deep , rhythmic , and resonant . In truth , his poetry bears little inspection on the written page . Consisting of a series of evocative refrains repeated over and over , held together with fragmented , often banal prose , Mbuli 's poetry is the means by which a collection of individuals is turned into a crowd . TABLE <p> Like other movements of oppressed people , the liberation movement in South Africa has sustained itself through 10ng , hard decades of repression on myths and dreams and wishes . A body of legend , mixing traditional story with the history of the ANC , has developed around the heroes of the people . The future beyond apartheid has become the stuff of myth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is about the expectation of change ; it looks to some kind of millennium before it looks to any expectable future . <p> When the talks have ended and the new South Africa is finally shaped , how many compromises will have been forced , how many dreams shattered ? <p> WHEN IN 1976 , FIRST IN SOWETO AND LATER THROUGHOUT the country , the first wave of militant township rebellion broke through South Africa , the ANC was at most peripherally involved . The kamikaze youth , who made the world sit up as they faced tanks and armored cars with slogans and sheer defiance , had been mobilized largely by the black-consciousness organizations . The ANC , though still foremost in the struggle in exile , was rapidly losing influence inside the country . <p> Once imprisoned , though , after the wave of repression hit , black-consciousness militants came into contact with the ANC stalwarts on the penal colony of Robben Island . Enduring the early years of breaking stones and suffering severe hardship , they had welded themselves into a formidable popular force . Led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their conditions , and even earned the grudging respect of their hardened jailers . <p> By the time the new wave of youth militants arrived on the island , the place was at the same time a kind of Socratic monastery and an experiment in almost biblical socialism . It was a place of intense , celibate study and debate . The prisoners were legendary for the dignity that they accorded one another ; Mandela himself cleaned bodily wastes out of the cells of sick prisoners . On arrival at the prison , new recruits were taken aside and advised that whatever might happen in the outside world , they should never cut ties with their families and loved ones . The ANC prisoners told them of the need for total honesty and trust in a place like Robben Island , emphasizing the importance of not allowing their dignity and human values to be destroyed . So successful was the instruction , according to one former prisoner , that a mislaid packet of cigarettes found its way back to him , intact , after three days of being passed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such stories are no more remarkable than the intensity of the education that the prisoners contrived on the island . Some prisoners used the opportunity as one for formal study , and over the years amassed formidable lists of qualifications through correspondence courses . Other inmates , who arrived functionally illiterate , left with developed reading and writing skills . <p> There was also a great deal of study and political debate on strategies for liberation . Most intensively debated of alt was the racial issue . The ANC , since its founding in 1912 , had prided itself on principles of nonracialism , which were later enshrined in its protoconstitution , the Freedom Charter . Color was not to be a factor in a future South Africa , and whites were welcome to work within the ranks of the movement . On this issue , more than any other , the black-consciousness movement differed . Its analysis was direct and simple : South Africa was stolen from the blacks and must be taken back by blacks . <p> Mandela , a lawyer by training , was considered the " rector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every point of political doctrine . " He just would not let go , " one fellow prisoner recalled . " If you ever wanted rest again in your life , you had to agree with him  --  or you had to convince him that you were in the right . " <p> By the time the authorities realized what was happening and moved Mandela in 1982 to a mainland prison , it was already too late . Robben Island was fondly referred to as the " university of the struggle . " And those who had gone in supporting the black-consciousness movement had been converted to ANC thinking and the cause of nonracialism . Before their releases , they had been exhaustively briefed , and though the lifers would not see the outside world for decades to come , they would dominate , through their lieutenants , the intermediate course of South African history . <p> Murphy Morobe , one of these lieutenants , laughs as he remembers his time on the island . " When the time came for me to be released , I almost wanted to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't yet complete . " <p> IN THE YEARS AFTER HIS RELEASE FROM ROBBEN ISLAND AT THE turn of the decade , Morobe emerged as one of the most visible leaders of the internal resistance . During these years , a highly politicized trade union movement developed under the covert sponsorship of the ANC and its ally in the struggle , the South African Communist Party ( SACP ) . In 1983 , the United Democratic Front : , a broad coalition of antiapartheid groups led by the unionists and other ANC-connected elements , was founded . For years , Morobe was the acting publicity secretary of the UDF , until his detention in August 1987 ; he escaped fifteen months later . Since the UDF had been banned in February 1988 , Morobe became a chief spokesperson for its replacement , the Mass Democratic Movement . <p> Morobe is a quiet man , not exactly shy but definitely reserved . He is a thinker and a strategist of note , not the kind of man to whip up crowds . Morobe has the kind of face that is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Soweto home , he laughs a lot . <p> But Morobe has been through a trial by fire . One of the lessons the ANC learned was that little could be achieved in extraparliamentary politics without harnessing the unruly energies of youth . Much of the work done by the new leadership of Morobe 's generation was directed toward this end ; grass-roots , UDF-aligned youth structures became increasingly powerful within the ANC-linked struggle . <p> Then in 1984 , all hell broke loose in the townships . Young " comrades , " organized under the banner of the UDF and following ( or perhaps followed by ) ANC directives , set about making the townships ungovernable . Schools were boycotted for months on end . Anti-rent campaigns were instituted . Nationwide strikes and stay-aways were organized . Government buildings and the houses of government collaborators were gutted . Daily there were violent confrontations between students and police , daily students were killed by police bullets , and daily their funerals turned into occasions for further violent confrontations between the comrades and the police . <p> It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the dragon they had aroused . Hundreds of kids were shot down in cold blood . Many thousands more  --  some under ten years of age  --  were detained and tortured for months on end . In the madness , a form of popular justice emerged in the form of " necklacings "  --  public burnings by means of a tire pulled tight around the arms , flied with gasoline and ignited . Hundreds of collaborators and informers were executed by township mobs in this way . <p> Morobe as UDF publicist was among those who had to pick up the pieces , who had to mediate , who had in the end to try to restore some kind of sanity . Looking back now , he acknowledges that mistakes were made . " We acknowledge that the degree of political education has not been commensurate with the degree and extent of the mobilization we have been able to generate , " he says . " You draw into the movement battalions and battalions of Young Lions and there are slogans and slogans . There is a contradiction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political education , and that poses a number of problems . You get landed with a huge number of supporters among youth  --  hearts in the right place , determined to become part of the struggle  --  but often they do n't understand the basic political positions of the movement . " <p> But now , as the politics of reason begin to take over from the politics of defiance , the game has changed . The leadership is starting , however warily , to circle the negotiating tables in search of a solution acceptable to both blacks and whites , which wilt end the decades-old deadlock between the forces of the state and the masses of the resistance . In this climate , it becomes increasingly urgent to sell the idea of compromise to a body of youth whose every inclination is summed up in the long-held UDF slogan : LONG LIVE THE SPIRIT OF NO COMPROMISE ! <p> " A very simple and easy position for people to adopt , given the history of our struggle , is that we 've got oppressed people on the one hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The simple thing there is that the oppressed must defeat the oppressors . It is proving difficult : for our people to adjust where objective conditions have begun to change . " <p> LIKE MOROBE , AZHAR CACHALIA EMERGED AS ONE OF THE sharpest and most incisive of the UDF leaders in the early 1980s . In 1987 , Cachalia was served personal banning orders preventing him from being quoted , attending public meetings , or leaving his home after dark . In December 1989 , his orders were , for purely bureaucratic reasons , briefly lifted . <p> But Cachalia called the government 's reformist bluff . He went to the press with the news that his ban had been lifted , and there was much made in the pages of the local media of the new sprat of glasnost sweeping the corridors of power . " The cops came to see me and said , There is a hell of a cockup and here 's another order  --  which I refused to take . I said , I 'm not taking your shit , and I 'm telling you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to look like real arses . And so they took the order and fucked off , saying , Well , we do n't want to look like monkeys and if Vlok the minister of law and order wants to sort it out , he can sort it out himself . " This was the last Cachalia heard of the matter . <p> Cachalia shares Morobe 's apprehensions about the gulf between generations : " Coming from our townships , young people who have been on the cutting edge of the struggle and brutalized by the system are prone to working to solve political problems in the same way they have experienced these problems  --  by violence . " <p> As he sees it , the solution for the ANC lies in organizational strategy . " What we have to do is not sit down and intellectualize the question of negotiations with the youth , but continue to emphasize the building of strong organizations , which will not only challenge the apartheid state but also discipline the membership . We have reached a stage now in our struggle against apartheid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have waged struggle , particularly in the past few years , that negotiations are on the agenda . Rather than looking at it as a sign of weakness , thinking there is some grand imperialistic design to sell us out , we should look at the question of negotiations as a challenge , as a new site or terrain of the struggle . " <p> IN THIS NEW SITE OF STRUGGLE , THE ANC LEADERSHIP NEEDS to retain the loyalty of people like twenty-year-old activist Lucky , ( * ) who lives in Kagiso township near Johannesburg . In 1985 , Lucky was detained by police in connection with an arson attack on a local school  --  a charge he denies , claiming that " they just picked up the first ones they could find and made them pay for it . " <p> For the next eight months , Lucky was moved from prison to prison , interrogated , tortured , bullied , and finally released without being charged . He remains stoic about his own experiences in detention . " I was subjected to torture on a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comrades I really felt sorry for were the ten and eleven-year-olds . They had n't even left their mothers yet , and there they were  --  having to deal with electric shocks , and suffocated with wet canvas bags , and chained and told they were going to be fed to the dogs that were barking outside . You could hear them crying every night . " <p> On his release , Lucky became one of what he calls " the heavy-duty comrades , the ones who did n't shy away from anything . " Though he declines to be more specific , he admits that he was part of more than one crowd that summarily executed informers by means of the infamous necklace . " It was a hard justice , but the times were hard . More than one of my comrades never came out from detention . My own brother is never going to be the same after what they did to him . How can I forgive , how can I forget ? " <p> As far as Lucky is concerned , the release of Nelson Mandela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now that Comrade Nelson is out of prison , life can be different . It 's the victory . No more police in the townships . No more gutter education . We do n't need to live in these townships anymore , " he says , indicating the cramped four-room house he shares with his parents , five siblings , and various friends . <p> But it is clear that he is bewildered . The sky did not go black the day Mandela stepped out of Victor Verster Prison . The government did not crumble . " This negotiation , you do n't have to believe it . Comrade Mandela is a professor , all the Congress leaders are professors , they know you have to trick these Boers to get what you want . Comrade Mandela will never talk to these Boers . " <p> Marcus , ( * ) the eighteen-year-old executive-committee member of one of the branches of the Soweto Students ' Congress , looks at it differently . Though intelligent and with a sense of commitment and responsibility beyond his years , Marcus has only just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lack of academic success by pointing out that in 1984 , it was his duty as an activist to boycott classes and examinations ; in both 1985 and 1986 , he was being held in detention by the police ; in 1987 , he was failed for being a troublemaker by his sellout school principal . <p> Through it all , Marcus has remained faithful to the ANC 's multiracial policy . When you ask him how it is possible that he still does not hate whites generically , he shrugs : " All the time I was being tortured , I knew it was for a nonracial democracy , for what I believe in . How can I change now ? " <p> Marcus also supports the idea of a negotiated settlement and accepts the necessity of the compromises it will bring-not blindly , but because the issue has been discussed at great length and from every angle in the branch meetings of his youth movement . Relevant documents have been circulated and pulled apart ; the demands set forth by the ANC as preconditions for entering the negotiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movement have addressed the group and presented interpretations of the movement 's current positions . And Marcus , finally , is satisfied . He has sufficient trust in the leadership to believe that any settlement reached will be the best for himself and his people . " It will be a long process , complex and not quick . What I want is a democratic government and people 's power , but when it is there , we 'll all have to be patient . " <p> Marcus is exceptional m many ways , but he is also the product of the campaign to turn the mobilized masses into politically literate organizations . Since 1976 ; young South Africans have steadily left the country for exile in the north , where they received both military and political training . In today 's pre-negotiations period , however , the exodus has all but stopped . <p> According to Vusi Gunene , a young activist from the sprawling township of Shoshanguve outside Pretoria , the townships have increasingly been infiltrated by ANC propaganda units as well as undercover combat groups . Even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lusaka could be found only hours later pasted up around industrial areas of downtown Johannesburg . <p> Where once these information groups would have produced pamphlets calling the people to arms , now their message is one of conciliation and compromise . Their goal is to sell the notion of a negotiated settlement as a victory for the people , rather than the compromise it may well turn out to be . At the same time , they are working to enhance the position of the ANC as a visible and credible presence in the townships . ANC LIVES ! ANC LEADS ! is the slogan currently most visible , but there is also a good deal of promotion of the " tried and trusted leadership . " <p> " The release of the leaders has caused even buried activists to come out of the woodwork , even people who have been sleeping for more than ten years , " says Vusi . " The kind of thing that happened in Namibia with the guerrillas pushed into exile , while the South Africans spread disinformation and tried to bring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can no longer happen here . We 've learnt our lessons , and the propaganda cadres are waiting in constant readiness to respond to any forms of disinformation . We remember all the smear pamphlets that have been dropped from military helicopters in the past . " <p> As busily as the ANC is propagandizing , it is being met by waves of counterpropaganda , as an alliance of Africanists , under the banner of the Pan African Movement , seizes on the potential disaffection of the masses . One flyer addresses the issue of negotiations head on : NEGOTIATION WILL NOT RESULT IN FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE ! ! REVOLUTION IS THE ONLY HOPE OF THE HOPELESS ! <p> It goes on : " The lie that the negotiating table is another arena of the struggle must be rejected for what it is . The negotiation table is no more than a facility to trade concessions and compromises . Therefore , what we did not achieve in the battlefield we could not hope to achieve at the negotiating table . " The Africanist flyer tails off in a blaze of slogans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANC and its mass organizations used to be . <p> For all the efforts of the ANC , all the work of unionists and democratic leaders , some fear the Africanists will regain the militant constituency they lost in the wake of 1976 . For Philip , ( * ) a graduate of the 1976 uprisings now in his mid-thirties , the possibility represents a sour irony . Philip is an organizer for the Farmworkers ' Union , an independent group not affiliated with the massive ANC-identified Congress of South African Trade Unions . Since beginning his work with the farm workers , one of the worst paid and most cruelly exploited economic sectors in South Africa , Philip has resisted the party-politicization of the union movement by either the ANC or the Africanist parties . <p> " The tragedy is that the workers have been used as pawns in the game of nationalist politics , " he says . " And the trade unions are to blame . " Rather than focusing on concrete workplace issues , Philip argues , the unions have been far more concerned with mass political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Living Wage campaign . <p> Philip also worries that the trade unions have failed to educate their base for the future . The unions , he charges , had enough resources to foster genuine debates and bring the workers to a point of political consciousness , but they chose not to . Neither , he says , did they put effort into training workers to move into more highly skilled jobs , instead leaving them " simply in a position to be supplied with a new set of bosses " once apartheid structures are dismantled at the workplace . " They have been pushing the myth of unqualified liberation , rather than preparing people for what had to come . Now they are going to pay the price . The movement is going to split because the interests of the workers are not the same as those of the ANC leadership . " <p> As the ANC begins negotiations with the South African state , the very economic platform that generations of workers organized around , fought for , and often died for seems up for grabs . In the 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workplace had everything to do with apartheid politics ; there was little to set the interests of workers apart from those of the ANC , and COSATU functioned as the strong right arm of the broader resistance . <p> Now , however , the situation has changed . Whites  --  13 percent of the population  --  still own an estimated 98 percent of South Africa 's industrial and commercial wealth . Redistribution of this wealth , in the form of nationalization , has long topped the ANC 's list of demands . But it seems increasingly clear that the policies of nationalization and worker control , around which COSATU and the other unions have mobilized , will not immediately be realized in the new dispensation . Full hands of cards in the negotiations game will be dealt to government , capital , and the ANC , and many fear that worker interests , at least in the transitional period , will be marginalized . <p> Angrily , Philip asks : " Do we just want democracy ? Or do we need to be asking questions about the economic system that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond compromise in the name of democracy ? The workers have been led down the path that things are going to be okay . But things have not been spelled out as to just what it is that is going to be okay . " <p> THE INTERESTS OF WORKERS WILL IN ALL probability be addressed in the new South Africa by a bill of workers ' rights , but it is unlikely that this will be enough to satisfy the unions ' political aspirations . Certainly it falls far short of what both the unions and the ANC leadership had formerly promised their grass-roots membership . <p> Jay Naidoo , general secretary of COSATU and one of the key political figures inside South Africa , acknowledges that shortterm economic growth is largely dependent upon finding compromise solutions . " I would n't deny our socialist orientation , but we have seen the problems facing Eastern Europe because of an overcentralized command economy . At the same time we have seen the problems caused by an unbridled free-market system . We are researching ways to devise a system that we believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as maintaining economic growth in a high-wage economy . " <p> South African Communist Party general secretary Joe Slovo , in a recent discussion paper titled " Has Socialism Failed ? " , defended the policy of nationalizing services and key industries . But he conceded that a mixed economy , one with capitalist as well as socialist elements , and an independent trade union movement would be the most workable in South Africa . <p> THE ANC STANDS AT THE HEAD OF A COALItion united more in its opposition to the apartheid government of South Africa than by any shared programmatic or ideological commitments . In the past , implicit divergences have been easily hidden under the blanket of resistance to a common enemy . But now , the enemy has withdrawn that guarantee of unity by promising limited reforms . As the mythical future recedes , and a real , tatty , compromised , far-from-golden future clicks into focus , the real differences in policy and direction are starting to show . <p> Few doubt that South Africa is moving toward a democratic solution in its long struggle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world ideological baggage is being jettisoned has made it all the easier for the ANC leadership to offer accommodations on the threshold of finally taking power . There are obvious conflicts between the liberal-democratic ANC and the more militantly socialist stance of organized labor . But the great imponderable remains the anger of the people , epitomized by the township youth . These are the very people who are to a great extent responsible for the movement attaining this point in the struggle . And many of them retain an underlying fear that they could be robbed of the victory they believe they have earned . <p> Lucky says he is confused . Like most of the rank-and-file township youth , he has very little to lose  --  and , failing a total social transformation , not a great deal to look forward to . " We have our leaders and we have our heroes , " he says . " But we also have the slogan of No More Heroes . I do n't know if this one or that one is the one that is correct . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " the people will be free . " " No issue is not negotiable . " <p> In a recent interview , Nelson Mandela discussed issues facing youth and the ANC . <p> Q. You made a point at the Grand Parade of praising the Young Lions for having , I think you said , " energized the struggle . " There has been a lot of concern over the years about the ability of the movement to control all elements of the so-called comrades . Are you confident that this discipline is possible , and how do you see it coming about ? <p> Mandela : A black youth  --  meaning anyone not white  --  we must appreciate their problems . Their education is controlled by the government .... The government prescribed the type of syllabus we should have ; they do n't vote sufficient funds to enable us to improve the quality of our education ; the black teachers have not got the same facilities that are open to white teachers . And the parents of the children have no effective voice in the running of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What else would you expect ? <p> You take the examples of the ruling white Nationalist Party , of the youth of the NP during the time when the United Party a conservative English-speaking party was strong in this country . They broke up UP meetings , they beat up speakers  --  and why should the revolt of the black youth create such concern ? It is again the exaggeration of whites who want to monopolize political power and who want to justify it by saying blacks are not able to run their own affairs . <p> I have no doubt personally that if you call meetings , sit down to discuss with youth organizations , that they will accept any suggestions we make to them as leaders of the community . Q. To follow up on that , at the first rally , there were several acts of indiscipline  --  looting and so on . Is this an issue that you feel can be easily solved ? <p> Mandela : Well you must look at this question from the point of view of what happened at that meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because of the size of the crowds ' it was not possible to stay on time . And people had been waiting there from early morning , on a very warm day , and people , young people , became impatient . The impatience of youth is something we must accept . <p> And in that situation , you know , they lost control of themselves . But taking into account the large crowds and the long hours wasted , there should have been even greater disorder than actually took place . <p> Q. Your statements on nationalization will be used to whip up resistance from the white community . But people in COSATU and the SACP have indicted that they are prepared to rethink some of the issues around nationalization . When you said earlier , " no issue is not negotiable , " world you include nationalization ? <p> Mandela : Nationalization is the fundamental policy of the ANC , and the statements that have been issued do not suggest the ANC has now departed from this policy . Now I have said that we are prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the ANC . We must recognize that all this hullabaloo about nationalization is totally misconceived , because nationalization of certain sectors of the economy is part of the history of this country . Communications have been nationalized ; many other sectors of the economy have been nationalized . The NP once declared support for the nationalization of the mines . All that time , whites had the monopoly of political and economic power . <p> But now the situation is changing . It is clear that the day is not far off when blacks will also have a dominant role in the political and economic structure of the country . Now the whites are turning around and saying nationalization is not good , you must privatize . Because they have got the economic and financial muscle , they have got the resources to buy the industries that would be privatized . We do n't have the resources . We can not accept that .
