If you were cleaning your garage and stumbled on a 35-year-old bicycle , you 'd notice 2 things : ( 1 ) your garage has n't been cleaned in a while , and ( 2 ) a ' 61 bike does n't look a whole lot different from one you 'd buy today . You 'd see a bike with a diamond-shape frame , spoked wheels , rim brakes , derailleurs , chain , crankset , and pedals . But if you hopped aboard and pedaled down the street , you 'd discover huge differences . The bike would be heavy , the wheels sluggish , the shifting sloppy , the brakes spongy , and the saddle downright diabolical . The essence of the modern bike may have existed by the mid 20th century , but the refinements that make today 's machines so efficient and rider-friendly have come in the last 3 1/2 decades . To spotlight the best , we scoured our back issues and picked the brains of industry veterans and cycling historians such as Gabe Konrad , publisher of Aeoleus Butterfly , a cycling-history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigns , but we 've done out best to sift through the competing claims to find paydirt . Here are the key technological advancements that have made your shiny bike-the one you keep in your living room-such a joy to ride . Sidepull brakes ( 1969 ) Campagnolo , the Italian company that introduced the hub quickrelease lever ( in ' 33 ) and perfected the rear derailleur ( ' 50 ) , comes through again with the first top-notch rim brake , the sidepull Record . It 's light , mechanically simple , easy to adjust , powerful-and expensive . Centerpulls , previously the brake of choice , begin to die a slow death as other companies adapt Campy 's design . Sealed bearings ( 1971 ) Phil Wood shows us how to keep our bearings by launching the first production sealed cartridge-bearing hub and bottom bracket , setting the standard for protecting these components ' grease and guts from the elements . The invention proves a boon for maintenance and durability , especially for the yet-to-be-conceived mountain bike . Titanium frame ( 1974 ) The first gray-metal bike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it big . In ' 74 , though , the Teledyne Titan becomes the first Ti frame to achieve some success , pioneering technology that Merlin and Litespeed will take to the next level in the ' 90s . Hardshell helmet ( 1975 ) Until Bell launches its Biker hardshell , the norm for headgear is a helmet dubbed the hairnet . Made of skimpy leather strips , it offers all the protection of a cotton cap . But that does n't matter because riders who worry about protecting their brains have to be wimps . The Biker , though heavy , hot and unattractive by today 's standards , offers the first genuine head protection and helps change attitudes about cycling safety . Carbon-fiber frame ( 1976 ) Yes , a giant oil company used to be in the bike biz . The Exxon Graftek begins to marshal carbon 's distinctive properties  --  including light weight and comfort  --  into a widely available bike frame weighing fully one pound less than existing steel models . Top U.S. racers ride the bikes to many a victory , though the frames show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the technology paves the way for today 's carbon wonder bikes . Another milestone : Kestrel , the first production , one-piece , airfoildesigned carbon frame , arrives in ' 86 . Resistance trainer ( 1976 ) Torture device or winter fitness boon ? However you feel about it , RacerMate 's " wind load simulator " mimics real-world riding better than any previous indoor trainer . Equipped with fans that blow wind into your rear wheel , it gives you a monster workout even when it 's too dark or miserable to ride outdoors . High-performance clincher tire ( 1977 ) Expensive , messy to install , a bitch to repair , and downright dangerous to ride on if you did n't glue them perfectly , tubular tires were once the only alternative to heavy clinchers for performance riders . Specialized 's Turbo tires change all that . Here 's a clincher nearly as light as a tubular , but much easier to mount and repair . The Turbo may not be the first lightweight clincher , but it 's the first to last . Anatomic saddle ( 1977 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Touring and Racing saddles , seats came in 2 basic models : fence rail or tractor seat . Whichever you chose , your hindquarters rebelled . We 'll admit that the perfect saddle has yet to be designed , but the concept of shaping seats to fit your posterior has been a huge asset . Also credit Avocet with the first gelfilled saddle in ' 86 . Mountain bike ( 1979 ) Fixing a date for the birth of this most popular of bikes is guaranteed to kick up a fuss . So we 'll acknowledge that various tinkerers had been messing with off-road bikes for decades until the Marin County crew  --  including Gary Fisher and Tom Ritchey  --  coined the term " mountain bike " and started successfully promoting these literal and figurative groundbreakers . A tip of the helmet to Mike Sinyard of Specialized , whose Stumpjumper brought knobbies to the masses in ' 81 . Cyclecomputer ( circa 1980 ) The first bike computer , the Pacer 2000 , is n't a whole lot smaller or lighter than today 's laptops . But it ushers in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly a touch of a button brings you much more information than basic speedometers and odometers ever could . It takes the guesswork out of riding . Kudos to Avocet for introducing the first compact computer , the Cyclometer 20 , in ' 84 . Wireless heart-rate monitor ( 1982 ) If the cyclecomputer opened the door for advanced training , Polar 's heartrate monitor smashes it off the hinges . Though available in Europe sooner , the Polar Sport Tester 2000 hits the U.S. in ' 82 . Perfecting the technology of transmitting accurate pulse readings using a chestband and wrist receiver  --  and no wires  --  the Polar revolutionizes fitness . Concepts such as anaerobic threshold , max heart rate , and heart-rate zones soon enter the vocabulary of everyone from elite racers to dedicated century riders . Affordable aluminum ( 1983 ) Aluminum for the masses " is how we describe Cannondale 's first fat-tube aluminum bikes . Other have used aluminum before  --  see Klein and Vitus  --  but C'dale brings the price down to less than $600 for a complete bike . It 's the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1984 ) When 5-time Tour de France winner Bernard Hinault and his young teammate , Greg LeMond , arrive in the US. for the ' 85 Coors Classic stage race , they bring with them a strange new pedal from Look , a French company . No toe clips or straps , just a white aluminum body that clicks and holds your shoe when you step onto it . The positive engagement and ease of entry/exit quickly sweep the market . In ' 91 Shimano cooks up its famous " Spud , " the SPD step-in mountain bike pedal . ( We 'd be remiss not to mention a clipless precursor : Cinelli 's M71 pedal , appearing in ' 71 . Entry and release required reaching down to slide a lever , so it never gained wide acceptance . ) Index shifting ( 1984 ) Click shifting has been around for years  --  both Suntour and Shimano took a crack at it  --  but not until Shimano 's SIS does anyone deliver a system that works well enough to gain popular acceptance . Overnight it transforms shifting from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides the creation of the mountain bike , no other modern advancement makes cycling more accessible to newcomers . Shimano 's intro of combined brake/shift levers ( ' 90 for the Rapidfire mountain bike system , ' 91 for the Dual Control road version ) adds the concept of shifting ergonomics  --  making the bike accommodate the rider . Sunglasses ( 1984 ) Talk about a product that changes the face of cycling . No self-respecting rider with good eyesight wore sunglasses until ' 85 when Greg LeMond dons a pair of Oakley Eyeshades  --  more like goggles than glasses , complete with a foam strip across the top for catching sweat  --  and rides to third place in his first Tour de France . Suddenly eye protection and style count . Spandex clothing ( circa 1985 ) It 's not a bike part , but this stretchy , skin-hugging , lightweight clothing material  --  created in ' 59 and used in sportswear about 25 years later  --  has made riding infinitely more comfortable . Ask riders who grew up wearing itchy , hot , hard-to-care-for wool . Spandex 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but so far nobody has discovered a better material to put between your tender parts and a saddle . Aero handlebar ( 1986 ) Pete Penseyres shows up for the ' 86 Race Across America with what our reporter describes as " a padded horizontal shelf attached to the handlebar " By resting his forearms on the " shelf ' Penseyres becomes more aerodynamic , takes pressure off his hand , and adds an estimated 1 mph to his speed . It pays off : Penseyres wins the 3,107mile race in a record 8 days , 9 hours . The aero bar is born , then developed by Scott and Profile . Lightweight helmet ( 1986 ) Lids had gotten a little lighter and cooler in the decade since the Bell Biker arrived , but helmet use does n't take off until Jim Gentes steps forward with the Giro Prolight . A foam shell with spandex cover , the Prolight weighs next to nothing but still protects your noggin . And its stylish looks convince even hard-core racers they can be safe without being dorky . Energy bar ( 1987 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main food groups until PowerBar , the little brown bar that 's spawned a school of competitors . It delivers quick energy , does n't spoil or go stale , never gets bruised or pulverized in your jersey pocket , and is easy to eat and digest in the saddle . You can argue with any energy bar 's taste , but you ca n't dispute that they 've altered the shape of cycling and sports nutrition  --  to rectangular . Twist-grip shifting ( 1988 ) Twist-style shifters have been around for decades , but SRAM 's Grip Shift is the first unit good enough to gain popular acceptance . Although Grip Shift does n't catch on for road bikes , the mountain bike version proves a big hit with its quick , crisp , hands-on-the-bar shifting . It also lightens Shimano 's stranglehold on the component market . Composite wheels ( 1989 ) Francesco Moser pioneers disc wheels with his ' 84 hour-record bike , but the early solid hoops are heavy and hard to handle in the wind . Steve Hed massages the concept to produce an aerodynamic wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoked wheel with an aluminum rim faired with a carbon fiber V-section . It debuts at the ' 88 Ironman Triathlon and the following year rolls out to an increasingly aeroaware public . Hydration system ( 1989 ) Drinking from a water bottle on a bumpy trail can be an exercise in frustration and lost momentum . CamelBak 's 70-ounce backpack-style bladder and sipping tube changes that . You can drink  --  and carry just about all the liquid you need  --  while barely taking a hand off the bar . Keeps your water supply out of the mud , too . Hydration is no longer a problem for mountain bikers or long-distance roadies . Suspension fork ( 1989 ) Bicycle suspensions have been around since the late 1800s , but nobody had come up with a workable shock-absorbing system for mountain bikes until Paul Turner unveils the Rock Shox fork . Instantly it lets you ride offroad much faster and more comfortably . A suspended bike is also easier to control and more forgiving of mistakes . How sweeping is this ? How many mountain bikes with rigid forks do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Go back 100 years and you 'd find bikes with rear suspension . But you can trace the roots of today 's speedy , plush dual-suspension mountain bikes to Offroad 's Pro-Flex , the first mass-produced , off-road , rear-suspension bike . Credit is also due to other bump-eating pioneers such as Kestrel ( which developed the never-sold Nitro in ' 88 , with a prototype suspension fork from Rock Shox founder Paul Turner ) and Boulder Bikes ( which launched a production dual-suspension bike with the original Rock Shox suspension fork in ' 91 ) . <p>
