The Vortex . <p> The Baptist church , its steeple reaching nearly as high as the hill , stood at one end of the town . Except for the woman who would be cleaning it for services tomorrow , the church would be empty . So would the Methodist church , which stood at the opposite end of their shared cemetery . The other buildings - the two stores , the post office , the voting house , an outdated tavern , and several houses - were spilled at varying angles along the two roads that wound into town and crossed there . The stores would be busy , with people coming and going . Some folks would be sitting under shade trees in their yards , maybe shelling lima beans . The post office was already closed for the afternoon . <p> Duck Nicholson knew all of this and more without ever glancing down the hill . He was stretched out on the grass , his crumpled brown hat protecting his face from the summer sun , but he was n't asleep . He was paying attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body were the needle of a compass , his head was pointing north . The town lay at his feet . <p> This was a place he had visited almost daily for years and years . Most of the people below , whose business he could guess , knew just as well where he was . But they were n't sure what he was doing . <p> He knew what they said about him . They spoke of him in his presence , as if he were deaf or foolish or not really there . He attempted to be inconsequential , to be absent from matters of consequence in the community . Yet his arrival at the store or post office on an ordinary errand would always trigger a conversation , one of which he was never really part . <p> The storekeeper might say to someone , " Well , here 's old Duck . Wonder what he 's up to today ? " <p> Someone might say , " Duck , you been up on the hill yet ? " or " Seen any new birds lately ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did n't wait for Duck to answer . <p> In this way he had learned many things about himself . He learned that his neighbors believed he went up on the hill to wait for airplanes to pass or to watch birds . He learned that people still spoke of him as a first-rate fiddler although he had n't played in years . <p> He even found out what the women thought of him as a man . He was waiting for his mail one day when the postmistress insisted on telling the woman in front of him a remark she had overheard another woman make about Duck . <p> " Duck Nicholson - why if you was in his bed , you 'd have to shake the sheets to find him ! " <p> It occurred to him once that maybe they talked about him all the time , not merely in his presence , but he quickly discounted that idea . As far as he could tell , he existed for them in the way a ghost exists . As soon as he came around to haunt them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of their lives until he made his next appearance . <p> At first , and for a long time , he had climbed the hill in order to prove something to himself , but he had never really succeeded in proving his theory . Now , twenty years later , he came out of faith and simple habit . <p> Of course there had been incidents that supported the theory . Over the years two small planes had crashed in the mountains nearby . Investigators had attributed these crashes to fog or rain or the inexperience of the pilots , but Duck believed of 1957 , a balloon tagged and sent aloft by some school children in Michigan had landed on the hill . It had n't been the first thing to find its way there . <p> Locked in a chest in his bedroom was the item that had begun his research so long ago . On the day he had climbed the hill for the first time , he was a swimmer surfacing for air , ready to burst from the pressure of an enormous wrong . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper appeared to be the cover of a magazine , but most of its color was washed away . The address label was still intact and readable . The magazine had belonged to a man who lived in a town in Oklahoma that Duck had never heard of . He tried to imagine how the paper had landed in this meadow on this hill in Aurora , Virginia , but he could n't fathom the mystery . He folded the paper , tucked it in his jacket pocket , and forgot about it for a few days . <p> The fragment of paper bound him to a past when he was alive . Now in his daily vigil on the hill , playing for Emily was the memory he clung to and wished hopelessly to forget . <p> Jut the little flip of her billowing skirt when she swirled across the dance floor , a flip that revealed her dainty legs up to her knees , had made Duck 's heart swell in his chest . She would swing from partner to partner , tipping her chin up to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a girl , not more than sixteen , but oh how Emily loved to dance ! <p> Sometimes she would dance toward him and her eyes appeared to meet his and he would dip his fiddle ever so slightly and play for all he was worth . It was the only gesture Duck could make . He carried on a one-sided conspiracy with her from his fiddling stance , playing all the tunes he could tell she liked best , the fast ones like " The Rick and Rambling Boy " and " Roll , Jordan . " He took delight in watching her delight , and he felt bold in so doing . <p> Duck was young then , in his early twenties , and fast making a name for himself as a fiddler . He played with different musicians , usually a guitarist or two and a banjo player , at dances throughout the area . The dances would be held in houses or barns or even outside in warm weather ; sometimes a storekeeper would push his tables of merchandise against the wall and hold a dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wherever the dances were , accompanied by one or more of her older brothers . <p> Once Emily had walked toward Duck , had actually walked up to him and asked him if he would please play " Fire on the Mountain " for her . She spoke to him and he fulfilled her request , urgently and immediately playing the song with enough intensity to burn the bow . <p> " She did n't care about nothing or nobody when she was on that dance floor . She was in love with the music . And I was the music . " <p> The musicians he played with were older than he was , rough and worldly , and they laughed at his naivete and urged him to drink their whiskey . They had their eyes on all the women and they noticed Emily . They called her a tease and hee-hawed at Duck when his ears turned red at the mention of her name . <p> " She were n't no tease . She was just a sweet little dancing fool , that 's all . Sweet as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it had happened , or whether he could accuse himself of complicity , or even if somehow his innocent longing for Emily had , in fact , caused it to happen . In any case , he would rather have died . <p> " I been dead all these years . I put my fiddle away . I do n't play it no more . " <p> She caught a ride to a barn dance one night with a neighbor . Her brothers were all busy , but she could n't miss a dance . It was winter time , but everyone stayed warm from the dancing and the liquor that was hidden outside in someone 's car . The men and some of the boys sneaked out from time to time , returning with pink faces and vacant grins . <p> They set up their instruments under the hayloft to leave the center of the barn open for the dancers . When they began to tune up , the crowd moved from awkward , ragged groups into hand-holding pairs . Duck braced the fiddle in his characteristic way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly with the bow . The other musicians took their places behind him : he was only a boy , but they acknowledged manhood in his musical ability . <p> Duck played that night as if the fiddle were his invention and he owned the only one . He never took his eyes off Emily , who glowed with the fever she had caught from his music . He and his fiddle were only partners ; his music swayed and floated with her across the floor . Only her little feet were fast enough to keep up with the notes he drew . Watching her , he could feel his heart rise up in his throat and threaten to take his breath away . He played " Fire on the Mountain " last , playing as if he were being consumed in a whirlwind of fire and smoke . <p> He had just brought himself back down to earth and was spacing his fiddle in its case when he realized that the banjo player , Kelso Wood , was speaking to Emily . He held one of her tiny hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing eyes . For just an instant , not even that long , Duck hated those teasing eyes . But he hated Kelso more . <p> They walked toward Duck and the other musicians , Kelso propelling Emily with his hand on the small of her back . <p> " This little gal needs a ride home . What do ya say , fellers ? " Kelso asked the group , but he winked at Duck . <p> Duck looked down at his feet . He heard the men packing up and preparing to leave ; he could hear them laughing and joking . He even heard the trill of Emily 's laughter , but he could n't hear what she was saying . <p> Trailing behind them out to the car , his eyes cast downwards , Duck tried to think only of the present , of the ground he covered and its irregular , rutted surface . The ruts had been made in mud , but the mud was frozen now . Hoofprints left by cows and horses were cemented by the frozen mud . " Where are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Ford was hard to crank in cold weather . Duck climbed into the back seat with Ed , the bass player . Emily sat in the front , between Bill , who played guitar , and Kelso . <p> Kelso said , " Well , gal , did you know our fiddle player has got a crush on you ? Ai n't that right , Duck ? " <p> Emily turned around and smiled at Duck . " Is that so ? " she asked him . <p> He thought of all the things he could say , all the wise things , but under the spell of her smile he only stammered , " I reckon . " <p> She laughed at him then . They all did . <p> This time when they passed their bottle of moonshine around , Duck took a long drink . He thought he could n't get his breath at first , and the men laughed at his spluttering , but the second drink was easier . He heard Kelso coazing Emily to take a sip , and he thought she did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until a weakness that was not unpleasant ran all the way through him , down to his feet , and he had to strain to listen to the others talking . He could pretend he was n't even there . <p> He had no idea where he was , anyway . It was a dark as it could be on a winter night in the country . The car drove along curving roads , up and down hills . The curves and hills began to make Duck dizzy , so he laid his head back and looked up at the stars in the clear winter sky . He focused on one bright star and made his eyes follow it . Sometimes he would lose it for a moment when they passed under trees or dipped below a hill , but he was always glad to see it again . <p> It seemed as if a long time had passed , as if they had chased the star too far across the sky . He heard the others talking without listening to them , without making connections between what one said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How much further do you live , gal ? " <p> " Not far now , just a little ways on . " <p> Then , " That 's the road to my house , that one right there . " <p> Kelso turned onto a long rocky driveway scraped out through a bramble of trees . At the end , maybe a half mile , maybe farther , a light shone in a window . As they bounced over the road , Duck watched the light as fixedly as he had followed the star . <p> The trees ended and the driveway crossed on open field . A little road branched off to the left , and Kelso turned down it . <p> Emily said , " You turned wrong . This ai n't the road to my house , this road goes to the barn . " <p> No one answered her . No one said a thing . <p> Kelso swung off the road into a grove of trees and switched off the motor . <p> " How about giving us a little kiss , honey ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's waiting up for me . I got to git home right now . " <p> Kelso pulled her over to him by the hair and kissed her hard . She slapped his face and Bill and Ed laughed . Duck stared at the front seat with his mouth open . He thought he was dreaming , that he had blinked his eyes and the light that was her home had disappeared for a moment . <p> Kelso opened the door and dragged Emily out of the car . She kicked and screamed and struck out wildly with her arms until Bill and Ed grabbed her and flung her to the ground . Kelso pulled Duck out of the back seat and propped him up on the running board . Duck 's heard lolled to the side and he pushed it back against the car to keep it upright . Staring down his nose , he focused on Emily . <p> " I swear , Duck , you as drunk as a skunk . I 'm ' onna show you how it 's done . " <p> The little soft shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , but Bill and Ed pinned her shoulders to the ground . Kelso stood above her , muttering at her in a low , hard voice . <p> " You little tease , you keep your mouths shut . You little bitch . " <p> He dropped his pants and fell upon her . She squealed once , a long gasping squeal , and Duck thought , " He is crushing her , he is smothering her , " but then she began to sob . <p> Kelso 's white ass heaved up and down . Duck turned his head and vomited . He passed out and fell from the running board , but he woke up instantly when his cheek struck a cold , sharp piece of gravel . <p> Kelso 's rough hands pulled him to his feet . Emily lay motionless on the ground , as if she were still being held in place . Her face was turned sideways and one of her arms covered her eyes . Her skirt was shoved up around her waist and her legs were flung out and twisted . Duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Kelso said , " C'm on , we got to git out of here . " <p> Bill tossed Emily 's coat across her legs . They shoved Duck into the back seat and drove off . He closed his eyes and thought of the light at the end of her driveway , willing that she would reach the light safe from his nightmare . <p> Duck was not aware of anything else until Bill helped him up the steps to his front porch and found his key to open the door . He half carried Duck into the house and placed his fiddle upon the hall table . <p> " See you round , kid , " he said as he closed the door behind him . <p> When Duck woke up in the morning , he put his fiddle away in a closet and began his wait . He waited for days , then weeks . He waited to read in the newspaper that Kelso had been arrested for murder . He waited for the sheriff to come to his front door and arrest him , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them up . He waited for Emily 's father or one of her brothers to drive up carrying a gun . He waited to give himself up . <p> He feared that Emily believed that he , too , had raped her . This thought was worse than the waiting . <p> His mother and father watched him waiting , staying in the house day after day . An only child of old parents , Duck had always been quiet , but they had never known him to forsake his fiddle . They had depended on his music to help them understand his moods , and they were bewildered without it . <p> One evening soon after the end of the music , his father returned from the store with a message . <p> " Boy , I seen Kelso Wood at the store . He wants you to play with them next Saturday night . " <p> " No , Pa . I ai n't never playing that fiddle with Kelso Woor or nobody else again . " <p> " Why , boy ? Ca n't you tell your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " Duck started for the door of the closet , thinking that if he broke the fiddle in two his father would understand his answer was final . But he could n't do it . <p> After several weeks had passed , he began to go out of the house . He helped his father in his cabinetry business . He walked to the store on occasion to listen to the talk . Something still clutched at him and twisted hard , and he spent hours speculating . <p> Emily must be alive . Maybe she could n't would n't tell anyone what had happened . Maybe her parents felt that she had gotten what she deserved for going off to the dance by herself . <p> One spring day he rode with his father into town ( " town " was the country seat , about eight miles from Aurora ) to deliver a piece of furniture , and he saw Emily . She was walking down the street with some other girls . They were talking and laughing and looking into store windows . She wore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother called a sprig . Her dark wavy hair had been bobbed and it glistened in the sunlight . Following with his eyes the movements of her elbow , he watched her point out items on display in the Family Store . He slid down in the pick-up seat when she turned around and walked in his direction . He saw at once that she was not Emily . " How could it be her ? " he had thought . <p> That was the day he had climbed the hill behind his house for the first time , trying to reach above a world inhabited by savages and fools like himself . He had found the slip of paper from Oklahoma and taken it home . <p> Then he had read in the newspaper about a severe tornado in Oklahoma . The tornado had swept through the town where the owner of the magazine lived . With no evidence to the contrary , Duck reached the conclusion that the wind had brought the magazine 's cover all that way . <p> He returned daily , often bringing homemade apparatus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own version of a windsock and planted it on the hill . At various times , other strange and far-flung items would appear on or near the hill . When he balloon sent by the school children landed , he mailed them a carefully printed note so they would know the fate of their experiment . <p> Sometimes he could be seen pacing the hill . Sometimes , to the boys who made a game of watching Duck , he seemed to be playing an imaginary fiddle . <p> He developed his theory : He had found the point where all of the world 's winds came together . It was a solitary achievement , for he shared his secret with no one . <p>
