A tandem is cheaper than marriage counseling any day . Then again , it might land you there in the first place . // In his book , The Tandem Scoop , John Schubert suggests that a good tandem team resembles champion ballroom dancers . Using his words , " They flow together , work together and mesh their energies perfectly . " Well maybe , but it took my wife , Barbara , to drag me onto the dance floor and now that we 're here , I have the distinct impression she 's waltzing while I 'm twostepping . Married 20 years , she and I bring markedly different goals to cycling . I suspect that my wife 's sudden need to bond has much to do with our approaching anniversary . When compared to emerald rings , a tandem seems like a screaming good deal . Not that our KHS Tandemania Comp was cheap , but if you can believe experienced tandem riders , it 's far cheaper than marriage counseling , or a divorce . " Divorce ? " my eldest son , Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My son , however , was not the only one who worried about us being locked in tandem . " You 're going to ride a bicycle with Andy ? " Barbara 's friends wondered aloud . Their concerns were not without foundation . I see myself as something of an alpha wolf who dreams of past and future glories : the Alpen Brevet in Switzerland and the Bataan Death Ride in less than an hour . I own a heart rate monitor , altimeter/cyclecomputer and clipless pedals . I look forward to long singletrack climbs across mountain passes and the familiar itch and sweet stink of success when my polypro is soaked with sweat . I love the smell of liniment on aching knees and hard striated calves and the farmer 's tan that accrues from an honest day 's labor under a relentless summer sun . In contrast , where I see cycling as away to build my wind , flatten my stomach , cut my thighs and metabolize testosterone , Barbara perceives the Tandemania as a kind of Love Bike-a complex but marvelous mix of steel , rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With this in mind , picture my wife in a white Victorian dress , white high-button shoes and a white parasol , coasting happily along while commenting favorably on our two sons , the passing flowers , birds , houses and vistas . All marriages , whether of spouses or cycling partners , suffer a few flats . And , studying the Tandemania , there were some holes we needed to patch before we could mount up . The resolution of who would be in front was relatively simple . Credit author Schubert for pointing out that the heavier rider typically serves as captain . Taking my rightful position at the helm , I tested the shifters and brakes while Barbara considered the stationary handlebar in back . She did n't really object to being in back-it was the term " stoker " she questioned . " Why is n't it called copilot , partner or engineer ? " she inquired over my shoulder . " It 's a guy thing , " I vaguely replied . My definition of stoker owes everything to A Night to Remember . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shovelers go down with their boilers to keep the sinking Titanic 's lights aglow . To my mind one of these massively brave , slightly suicidal draft-horsestrong Englishmen would make an excellent stoker . Running a close second , the image of a sweaty , coalcovered female in ragged bike shorts hammering behind me had a certain visceral appeal . I see Species star Natasha Henstridge in this light and would gladly accept more than half of the load to have her grace my stoker seat . These fantasies , however , are short-lived and , comparing a memorable encounter with Natasha to the cost of marriage counseling and divorce , I find it wiser to deal with Barbara 's white-dress-andparasol mindset . For our shakedown cruise we decided to take a four-mile , 1,000-vertical-foot climb trip to Triumph , a weathered mining town that sits at the end of our Idaho canyon . I tried to remember Schubert 's instructions but somehow managed to forget 7 the critical " Warn your stoker before you shift . " My first gear change instantly disconnected Barbara from her pedals . Glancing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like one of those over revved wind ducks that farmers nail to their fences . " Uh , sorry , " I apologized . " A little more warning would help , " she admitted , through sweetly gritted teeth . Before I rode one , a tandem 's major ( and perhaps only appeal ) was speed . I saw our new blue Tandemania as a way to reel in cyclists fighting the wind , hills or fatigue . In my dreams , I watched Big Barb and I build steam until even the fittest rider cracked and sank in our wake . The reality was less impressive . By the time we crested , my tongue was banging on the stem and my mind was filled with a single , uncharitable thought : Was my stoker shoveling sand instead of coal into the boiler ? " Uh , honey , you feeling OK ? " I politely inquired . " Fine , " she replied as we rolled over the top . Dismissing my suspicions , I put my heart into the gentle downhill . Whether it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . I believe success is in the trying . It 's not a matter of how fast or how far , but how much you give-and for a brief but gratifying quarter mile , we gave everything to the top end 54/14 gear . Though BICYCLING recently published a groundbreaking survey of the relationship between long-distance cycling , seat design and male impotency ( August ' 97 ) , I 'd never given much thought to the effect of a racing seat on the female anatomy . Distracted by a speedy little Blue Heeler lying in wait in the barrow pit , I did n't notice the pothole until the front wheel dropped with a shock that sent a harsh shiver through the long frame . The collision elicited a yelp from Barbara who immediately educated me on the relative sensitivity of the female anatomy . Captivated by the resulting graphic images , I thoughtlessly cleared my nose which evoked a second protest . She told me she did n't mind pedaling hard , or sitting on a seat that looked like a flag pole swaying in a gale-force wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sprayed with spit , spittle , mucus or anything similar . " Uh , sorry , " I apologized . As partial salve for my bruised feelings , she volunteered that I was both massively strong and probably carrying more than my half of the load . " I 've never ridden this far without coasting , " she confessed . " And I realize I never shift at the right points . " It may seem like a back-handed compliment , but it marked a tide change in marital bonding . It also meant I 'd earned my first captain 's stripe . During subsequent rides I learned to warn my wife of impending bumps , shifts and corners . She , in turn , grew decidedly stronger . A tandem forces you to talk . It also serves as a governor against anaerobic redlining . I still , however , secretly yearned to experience a tandem 's vaunted speed and snuck off with Andrew . After a long winter spent racing on the Sun Valley Nordic Team , my eldest son was in superb shape . Too superb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse of his down stroke . Andrew 's remarkable powerto-weight ratio turned the Tandemania into a rocket ship . Unfortunately , I could tell he was less than impressed by my contribution . Chained by 21 forward speeds and four crankarms to a 15-year-old turbo charger packing 4% bodyfat , I eventually started to sag . Though Andrew did n't say so out loud , I know he would have preferred someone 20 years younger and 20 pounds lighter as captain . Taken in this light , I realize that an 80% effort and insights into birds , flowers and the human condition might well add up to the perfect stoker .
