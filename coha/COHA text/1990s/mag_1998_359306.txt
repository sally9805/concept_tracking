So where is Radovan Karadzic ? Probably in Serb-held Herzegovina , a barren wedge of land running from eastern Bosnia south toward the Adriatic . " He 's here , " says Bozidar Vucurevic , formerly of Karadzic 's Serb Democratic Party in the region , " And he 's defended not by any special troops but by the people . " Says a local party member : " It 's not easy to make an arrest in Herzegovina . We 're not cowards . It would n't happen without consequences . " <P> Perhaps . In the exaggerated mythology of the Balkans , eastern Herzegovina is the hard heart of Serb nationalism . The inhabitants pride themselves on being as inhospitable to interlopers as the rocky soil is to farming . " We see them as occupiers , " a local Serbian Orthodox priest says of the NATO troops in the region . Also convenient for Karadzic is the region 's extended , porous border with Serbia and Montenegro that provides ample escape routes in case of a snatch attempt . Most important , the entire region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Statistically , that is the safest place to be : of the 12 indicted war criminals detained by NATO troops , only one was taken in the French zone . <P> Herzegovians like to take the credit for that themselves , pointing to their defiant nature . At the Tvrdos monastery outside Trebinje , Bishop Atanasije Jevtic , head of the Herzegovina diocese , says NATO has disturbed archaeological work on the 4th century foundations of his abbey in search of Karadzic . " Can you imagine if we came to your church with tanks ? " he says . " They can come and take me to the Hague , and I 'd welcome it ! " In the musty office of the Association of Gusle Players and Epic Poets in a downtown hotel , Mitar Djogo is similarly defiant . After playing a few notes on the gusle , a primitive , one-stringed instrument that produces a noise akin to the bleating of sheep , Djogo says , " All Herzegovina will rise to defend him . " <P> Such boasts carry little weight with the NATO forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we detain Karadzic , nothing will happen . They have too many other problems . " The only impediments to his capture , say those working for peace in Bosnia , are in Washington , Paris and other capitals . Says U.S. diplomat Jacques Klein : " There wo n't be real justice until these people have their day in court . " <P>  --  By Massimo Calabresi/Trebinje
