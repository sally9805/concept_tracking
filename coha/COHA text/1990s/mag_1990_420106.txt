Section : SPECIAL REPORT CRISIS IN THE GULF <p> As the U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia continues , Iraq 's threats to round up American citizen raise the specter of a new hostage crisis  --  and heighten the chances of a full-scale war <p> Once again , Saddam Hussein kept out of sight as an announcer read a statement on Iraqi television last Saturday . It contained a grim threat to the well-being of 3,100 Americans and thousands of other Westerners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait . The spokesman alluded to a warning the previous day that citizens of " aggressive nations " would be held prisoner at Iraqi military bases and other potential targets for American bombers . And he warned that , because of the international embargo on trade with Baghdad , the foreigners would have to share whatever food was left over after Iraqi soldiers and essential workers had been fed . The austerity would apply , he said , even to " the babies of foreign families . " <p> As Iraq issued its threat , George Bush was out fishing off Kennebunkport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been added to his burdens . He had stressed all week that larger issues were involved , arguing in one speech that Saddam 's aggression in the oilfields of the Persian Gulf threatened " our jobs , our way of life , our own freedom and the freedom of friendly countries . " After receiving a briefing on the Iraqi statement , Bush responded temperately to the threats , saying through his own spokesman that he was " deeply troubled " by the " use of innocent civilians as pawns . " There was no mention of retaliation . <p> The administration 's plan was to wait Saddam out , hoping that the economic sanctions would start to bite soon . But contingency planning for a military operation was underway already , and if the Iraqis began to kill hostages , war seemed almost certain to follow . Even an effort to round up Americans in Kuwait for shipment to Baghdad could trigger a pre-emptive U.S. attack , not only on Saddam 's forces in Kuwait , but on Iraq itself . Any rescue mission was certain to be bloody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment of dire peril for the prisoners would look like the kind of impotence that helped to drive Jimmy Carter from office ( page 23 ) . <p> While American forces poured into Saudi Arabia , the standoff in the gulf turned a lot nastier . Bush and Saddam called each other liars . The Iraqi dictator warned that thousands of American soldiers could " go home shrouded in sad coffins . " He abruptly offered to make peace with his archenemy , Iran , so that he could concentrate on his American foe in what he called " the great dueling arena . " Bush imposed an outright naval blockade on Iraq , without waiting for the United Nations or anyone else . The first shots in that operation were fired on Saturday when U.S. warships tried to stop Iraqi tankers at two separate locations . The tankers refused to stop , shots were fired across their bows , and the Iraqis sailed on . The Americans shadowed them and planned to board them , if necessary , I after daybreak on Sunday . <p> We ca n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise from the situation on shore , including what one senior U.S. official referred to as " the hostage crisis , because that 's what it is . " Whether or not Saddam furnishes a suitable provocation , there will be growing pressure on Bush to use the force he has deployed . Military advisers will warn that the troops ' , effectiveness can only deteriorate in the harsh heat of the desert ( page 24 ) . Diplomats may conclude that military action is the only way to achieve one of Bush 's main objectives : to get Saddam out of Kuwait and restore the emir who ruled there before the Iraqi invasion . Some Arab allies , out on a limb with Bush , are calling him to arms already . " Saddam is not going to back away without suffering a military blow , " says a senior Arab diplomat . " He has to be defeated . That 's the only way to break his image of invincibility . " Saddam 's smartest course might be to do nothing , to wait for the forces arrayed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Arab diplomat tells an American . " We ca n't give him time . As I soon as you are able to deal him a devastating blow , you should do it . " <p> By next month , the Americans will be as I ready as they 're ever going to be , with about 125,000 combat troops and support personnel in the theater . Bush ordered a fourth aircraft-carrier battle group to the region . With the airlift of ground combat troops running far behind schedule , he commandeered 38 wide-body jets from civilian airlines to serve as transports . The president also prepared to activate thousands of reservists , mostly for duty in the logistical " tail " of the expeditionary force . Privately , American officials conceded that it would be months , at least , before there could be any significant reduction of U.S. forces in the gulf region  --  and that a complete withdrawal from Saudi Arabia probably would take years . <p> Already , some of the fighting men were beginning to chafe with impatience . Navy pilots searched the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carrier Independence . Air Force pilots based in Saudi Arabia played games of dare and double-dare with Iraqi planes . The Iraqis flew their fighters toward the edge of Saudi airspace . The Americans scrambled their F-15s , the fire-control radar " locking on " to the potential intruders . So far , the Iraqis were shying away . " I sure would like to give Saddam Hussein a big kick in the ass , " an F-14 pilot on the Independence told NEWSWEEK 'S Ray Wilkinson . <p> The Iraqis talked a good fight . An Iraqi newspaper boasted that U.S. planes " will fall down like dead sparrows , " and said that if any pilots try to parachute to safety , their " bodies will be torn into pieces wherever they fall , so that their souls will go to hell . " Fat chance . " When the Iraqi pilots see the Americans facing them in Saudi Arabia , their knees start shaking , " said Benny Peled , a former commander of the Israeli Air Force . " If given free rein , the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force for breakfast . " <p> Without resorting to force , Bush hoped to knock Iraq out quickly by imposing his own naval blockade to enforce the U.N . economic sanctions . In addition , his military advisers feared that shipments of munitions might get through the net , or that some Iraqi-bound ship might scuttle itself in the Suez Canal , depriving U.S. warships of the vital waterway . The U.N . Security Council had not voted a blockade and was not likely to do so until it saw evidence of sanction-busting . But as one U.S. official put it , " If you set up an embargo and then do n't stop ships to look at what they 're carrying , what are you there for ? " <p> Kuwait 's call for help : Bush used a deft but debatable legal justification for his blockade . Article 61 of the U.N . Charter allows nations to act in self-defense when attacked and to seek help from others . Washington wrote a letter for the Kuwaiti emir to sign , in which he asked the United States to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent a similar letter to other nations , inviting them to sign up . He left out the paragraph mentioning that the United States would be in charge of the operation . Sources said some nations  --  Australia was one  --  agreed to join the blockade and then were taken aback when they learned that the Yanks expected to be in overall command . <p> Bush 's unilateral action did not sit well with some nations , such as the Soviet Union and France , that had given crucial support to his original call for economic sanctions . " This problem will not be solved without U.N . involvement , " said another critic , Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York . " It has to be done under U.N . auspices and under a U.N . mandate . " The embargo had been holding up reasonably well before the blockade was imposed . Ships carrying cargoes for Iraq were turned back by many countries , including Saudi Arabia , Turkey and the United Arab Emirates . <p> One question mark was Jordan . Its ruler , King Hussein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained about the economic damage to his country , which depends heavily on its trade with Iraq . When Hussein rushed off to Kennebunkport to explain , rumors circulated that he was carrying a message from Saddam . The king arrived in Maine with empty pockets . " I did not bring any message , " he told reporters . Bush sent him off with nothing to show for his visit . " The president was not going to give him the peace of mind he wanted , " said a senior administration official . <p> Where 's Saddam ? Saddam Hussein may also be in low spirits . All week , there were no live appearances by the dictator on Iraqi TV . Even his most dramatic announcements were read for him by the same bland announcer . Was Saddam hiding out ? The world could only speculate . The Egyptians , waging a war of words with Baghdad , did so with a vengeance , publishing on their official news service a thinly sourced article claiming that Saddam had survived a coup attempt by " a number of close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fear for his personal safety , but they had no independent confirmation of the coup report , and no particular reason to think that the regime might be shaky . <p> Saddam displayed some strategic daring in the sudden rapprochement with Iran . In a " Dear Brother " letter to Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani , he offered to give back the 700 square miles of territory he had conquered in his eight-year war with Iran and to free all prisoners of war . Saddam thus gave up everything he had fought for , but he gained the freedom to concentrate on his new enemy to the south . He probably was hoping that the Iranians would help him break the sanctions . The outlook for that was uncertain . Iran showed no sudden love for Iraq ; it still opposed the invasion of Kuwait . But Iran also bitterly resented the U.S. intervention . <p> Saddam 's intentions concerning the hostages were harder to read . " Things were getting very ominous there , " a middle-aged British woman said after her escape from Kuwait City to Saudi Arabia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , so we decided to leave . " She and three relatives escaped across the desert in a four-wheeldrive vehicle , with Iraqi troops shooting at them on the border . She said some Westerners were now being hidden by Kuwaitis who had formed small underground groups to resist the Iraqis . " We never thought the Kuwaitis had it in them , " she said , " but they are prepared to fight back . " <p> On Thursday , Iraqi military authorities in Kuwait ordered American and British citizens to report to one of two hotels . Fearing deportation to Iraq , most of them refused to show up . Only five Americans assembled at the International Hotel , where there were no Iraqi officials on hand to receive them . In Baghdad , the omens were less benign . About three dozen American " restrictees " suddenly disappeared from the AlRashid Hotel , where they had been sequestered in relative comfort . U.S. intelligence received a report that they might have been taken by bus to another hotel , the Melia-Mansour , where British citizens were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was denied entry . <p> Bargaining chips : Last Saturday , the British Foreign Office said it had confirmed that 40 Britons , five Americans , four Germans and one French citizen had been moved from Kuwaiti hotels to undisclosed locations . Iraq 's ambassador to France said some foreigners had been " distributed in strategic installations in Iraq , starting all the way from the north of Iraq to the south . " Did Saddam mean to use the hostages as human shields ? Some Western officials thought he was merely hanging on to the foreigners for possible use later on as bargaining chips in negotiation . In this view , Saddam would sit tight and try to wait out the embargo . Others sensed a more malign intention . An Arab diplomat who sympathizes with Iraq thought Saddam was using the hostages to bait Bush into attacking him . Then Saddam would counter by attacking Israel , hoping to unite the Arabs behind him against the Israelis and Americans . " Israel is Saddam 's way out of this , " argued the diplomat . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn the tables on Saddam by waiting him out in hopes of a peaceful resolution . That would require the president to hold together somehow the broad but fragile coalition that produced the U.N . embargo and persuaded Egypt , Morocco and Syria to help defend Saudi Arabia . But after his meeting with King Hussein , Bush said he did not have " a feeling of hope " that Iraq would withdraw its troops from Kuwait or that a diplomatic solution would soon be found . Bush gave no ground on his original objectives , including restoration of Kuwait 's emir ; many presidential advisers still hoped that the crisis would lead eventually to Saddam 's downfall . For that ambitious agenda , it may be that the only workable option is force  --  or the imminent threat of it . That left many Americans with the queasy feeling of a drift toward war , and the grim suspicion that even victory could come very dear . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : U.S. soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division arriving at a base in Saudi Arabia . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a load of AIM 9 and AIM 7 missiles that is at the ready to arm U.S. F-15 fighter jets <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A member of Sheridan tank crew drinks mineral water to guard against dehydration <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Sporting camouflage gear  --  and digging in under a camouflage tent  --  in the Saudi desert <p> By Russel Watson with Ray Wilkinson in Saudi Arabia , John Barry and Margaret Garrard Warner in Washington , Ann McDaniel in Kennebunkport Rod Nordland in the Persian Gulf and the Bureau reports <p> THE BIOCKADE SQUEEZE AND . . . <p> As a U.S.-led blockade tightens the economic screws on Iraq , Saddam Hussein has apparently played a time-honored diplomatic card : hostage-taking . A look at the blockade and how U.S. forces might attempt to rescue the captives : <p> IRAQI OIL : Petroleum is Iraq 's most significant revenue source , accounting for 99 percent of its foreign trade . With Iraq 's pipelines through Turkey and Saudi Arabia shut off , accessible oil ports blockaded and most Western nations participating in an embargo , Saddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Shipping traffic to Iraq and Kuwait on the Persian Gulf has come to a standstill since the blockade was announced . President Bush ordered the 22 U.S. warships in the region  --  eight in the Persian Gulf , the nine-ship aircraft carrier Independence group in the Gulf of Oman and a five-ship Red Sea flotilla led by the carrier Eisenhower  --  to use the " minimum force necessary " to intercept vessels bound for Iraq . If a ship fails to stop when asked , a U.S. commander can lob a warning shot across its bow or board the boat to disable its engines . By the weekend , the Navy had stopped at least four Iraqi ships , firing warnings at two that refused to be searched . Both gave way . <p> AQABA : Until the Pentagon placed the Jordanian Red Sea port under the blockade , it served as Iraq 's last trade link to the outside world . Although little Iraqi oil is trucked to Aqaba for export along the road from Baghdad , Saddam has counted on the port as an inlet for a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its basic foodstuffs . Saddam may hope his overtures to Iran open a new route . A U.S. warship is also checking vessels entering the Suez Canal , perhaps in fear that Saddam will order an Iraqi ship to scuttle itself in the channel , making the passage unnavigable for months . War Options <p> To keep U.S. and other captives in Kuwait from being used as human shields at Iraqi military bases , Bush may make a rescue attempt . Freeing the thousands of Westerners and others in Kuwait City requires a full-scale invasion . By night , a paratrooper assault would S attempt to " kick in the door . " Slipped in beforehand , special forces units , such as Navy SEALs , would overwhelm Iraqi guards and try to free hostages . More heavily armed Marine amphibious units would land from the sea , possibly backed by aerial gunships to lay down fire on Iraqi strongholds . Four Iraqi armored divisions north of Kuwait would move on the capital . Without tanks of their own , U.S. forces would probably try to hold the line at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fire from A-10 Thunderbolts and other attack jets . <p> MAP : Saudi Arabia <p>
