<p> PLATTEVILLE - On a cold fall morning , Ben Houston led three cowboys into his embryo transfer barn . <p> In a gray steel chute stood No.150 , a glistening 1,600-pound Black Angus heifer with glassy eyes , swaying her head between restraining bars . Veterinarian Pat Hemming stuck a needle in the heifer 's spine , injected the epidural and pushed his arm inside her . He felt her ovaries , lifted the uterus and flushed it with salty water from a rubber tube . Clamping the tube , he let the water flow out another tube and through an 85-micron mesh filter designed to catch embryos . <p> " I 'm hoping we 'll have 10 , " Houston said , watching intently . <p> A sturdy 65-year-old , he wore brown boots and blue jeans slung low , two denim shirts , one buttoned over the other against the cold , and a jean jacket . His big calloused hands are as comfortable with tractors as financial papers . His sanguine face hides memories : the pain of losing an idolized brother , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brain tumor and five decades surviving as a rancher while hundreds of others failed . <p> Around 9:30 a.m. , a cellular flip phone in Houston 's jacket pocket rang . He stepped outside to talk , out where he could see the Weld County plains . He was expecting news from Ukraine . <p> Two years ago , Houston sold 2,000 embryos to ranchers in Ukraine . He froze the embryos in liquid nitrogen and sent them in an urn-shaped container by airplane to a state-owned farm in the former Soviet republic . Houston also sent 550 cows , 477 by ship and 87 , at huge expense , by plane . The deal was worth more than $ 5 million . <p> In the past , Houston has sold embryos , semen and cattle to Argentina , Mexico and Japan . An even bigger deal is in the works . <p> Some ranchers believe the new business of selling genetic material to foreigners could help overcome challenges to beef cattle ranching in the western United States . At home , environmental worries persist , there 's talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past two decades from 94.4 pounds per person to about 67 pounds a year . <p> But people in other countries crave the good U.S. steaks . Beef exports are booming to industrialized countries such as Japan , Canada , Mexico , Korea , Hong Kong <p> and Taiwan . Exports to former Soviet states increased by 971 percent last year , for a nine-month total value of $ 16.9 million . Overall , foreigners buy more than twice as much U.S. beef as they did in 1975 ; this year 's total tab is expected to top $ 2.5 billion . If the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade stimulates the world economy , as leading economists predict , people in places such as Mongolia soon could afford to eat beef . <p> Meanwhile , a handful of American ranchers have been using artificial insemination and embryo transfers to improve their herds faster than natural evolution allows . <p> Now Houston is trying to put all this together to take full advantage of his genetically superior stock . For the price of flying a single cow to Eurasia , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows . <p> DURING Denver 's National Western Stock Show , Houston walks easily with others among Colorado 's 9,000 or so cattle ranchers . He 's known as a humble , honest man , progressive in his thinking , but never risking what he ca n't afford to lose . People often call Ben Houston quiet . Close friends say he 's a shrewd listener with an uncanny ability to assess convoluted situations and apply common sense . <p> Houston 's Aristocrat Angus ranch lies on the St. Vrain River , near where the river meets the South Platte , by the Fort St. Vrain nuclear power plant . He owns about 2,000 acres . All told , he runs about 1,200 cattle , some on an additional 1,800 acres near Walden and more than 500 acres on the eastern prairie . <p> He shares the problem of development devouring air , water and open land with just about every rancher in the West . Oil and gas companies have drilled hundreds of wells in Weld County . Suburban homes are encroaching . <p> Yet only a handful of ranchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine - a five-year , multimillion-dollar contract . Ukrainian ranchers want bigger , leaner cows . Ukraine 's economy is shaky . But as long as Ukrainians pay cash up front , the risk to Houston seems small . " We are straightforward with them , and insist on them being straightforward with us , " Houston said . <p> Beyond Ukraine , he is thinking strategically about Asia in general . His 27-year-old son , Skylar , will meet in Washington this winter with officials from Mongolia , a possible base for beef production . Skylar also has visited China and Turkey . <p> Skylar handles more and more business affairs for his father , who likes to get up early for a few hours of paperwork before heading out on the ranch . Skylar is the youngest of four , two boys and two girls , just as Ben Houston was the youngest of seven . His maps cover walls in the family home , and he uses a computer network and data disks for information on foreign markets . The Houstons are especially interested in water resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . One Tuesday after returning from Ukraine , he and Ben were sorting cattle . Suddenly , Skylar could n't read numbers on ear tags . Ben immediately phoned his wife Nita . By 2 p.m. , Skylar was sitting in a Longmont eye doctor 's office . By 3 p.m. , he was in a Boulder neurologist 's office . By 7:30 p.m. , he was in surgery at University Hospital in Denver . The surgeons could n't touch the tumor , and do n't know for sure what caused it . It might have been a bull that bucked its head into Skylar 's head in the spring of 1993 . Skylar has lost some sight in his left eye . The good news is that the tumor is not cancerous . Doctors say it seems to be shrinking as a result of cobalt radiation treatments . <p> BEN Houston comes from a Colorado town that does n't exist any more . Buckingham closed down when the Burlington Northern railroad closed its Cheyenne-to-Sterling connection . In its heyday , Buckingham had a grocery store , a school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , Walter , and grandfather , Bennett , were cattlemen of Welsh descent . They settled in western Nebraska near the Sand Hills . Walter and his wife , Minnie , headed west to a homestead near Holyoke . In 1927 , they bought 6,000 acres near Buckingham . Walter raised horses and took Ben to races at small-town tracks . His instinct for recognizing good animals inspired Houston 's belief that man can make animals better . <p> " I 've tried to continue the process of improving whatever we 're breeding , whether it 's dogs or horses or cattle , " Houston said . " Actually , I 'm even interested in human genetics . " <p> When he was 9 , he showed his first Black Angus , " Karmair of Maple Drive , " at Denver 's National Western Stock Show . Later , at Sterling High School , Houston made many good friends , but not many classmates were interested in ranching . <p> He and his buddies often drove the 7 miles to the drugstore in New Raymer for malts . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , " Houston said . Of course , the real attraction was Nita Lambert , daughter of the owners , who worked behind the counter . <p> " They were pretty nice guys , " Nita recalled . " Struggling , but they had a lot of gumption . " <p> In 1950 , he married Nita . <p> " She 's given me the opportunity to work with livestock while she 's kept everything else together , " he says . " My family has always been believers in Christ , and to this day my wife is the cornerstone of our family . " <p> Houston joined the Air Force in 1950 , right after the wedding . Ben 's older brother , Raymond , was a pilot flying B-29 bombers over Korea . Houston wanted to fly bombers , too . <p> When he reported for training , Air Force doctors told him he had six broken ribs , probably from falling off a bull during a rodeo in Brush . Ben had n't noticed . He went ahead with training . <p> " I was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt that our country was the leader of the entire world , " Houston said . <p> One day in 1952 , Ben was home on leave in Buckingham , preparing for battle in Korea . A man knocked on the front door and delivered a telegram . Raymond had been shot down north of Okinawa and was missing in action . About 30 days later , a man brought another telegram : Raymond was dead . <p> So , instead of shipping out to Korea , the Air Force sent Houston to Illinois to train other pilots . He took some classes at the University of Illinois , studying nutrition and how to make urea , an artificial protein . <p> Meanwhile , Walter and Minnie Houston weighed the future of ranching . They were hard-working people who endured dust storms and the Depression , loving their land . Houston remembers his father trailing cattle 50 miles to find grass , and his mother hanging wet towels over windows to try to keep dust from blowing into the house . But their children were moving to towns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Houstons sold their land and cattle to a judge in Fort Morgan . They moved to Sterling to retire . <p> But their youngest son still had ranching in his blood . <p> AFTER Houston and veterinarian Hemming took embryos from cow No.150 , Hemming carried them to a clean adjacent room that looks part veterinary clinic and part science lab , with microscopes , water purification equipment and a programmable embryo freezer . <p> Hemming washed the embryos , each smaller than a grain of sand , into a square , half-inch-deep clear plastic petri dish with grid markings etched on the bottom . He peered through a microscope and counted 22 embryos . None looked very healthy . <p> Houston stood , hands in his pockets . <p> " They 're fertilized ? " Houston asked . <p> " I saw a couple that were fertilized , " Hemming said uncertainly , not raising his head from the scope . Hemming is a veterinary doctor , educated at Colorado State University . " I do n't know if that snowstorm hurt us or what , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animals become unsettled . <p> Extracting embryos and semen , then injecting this material into " host " cows , is the core of Houston 's strategy for improving his genetic stock . Staying ahead of global competitors depends on constant genetic improvement . Houston has some of the nation 's top bulls and heifers . Every mating is planned and executed artificially using metal injectors that resemble radio antennas . <p> Ukraine had to send six ranchers to Colorado to learn the techniques . Training foreign clients is crucial , Houston said , so that they do n't waste the genetic material they buy . <p> CSU experts , like George Seidel , a pioneer in animal genetic engineering , see huge potential in what Houston is doing . But still , there are risks . Only 60 percent to 70 percent of Houston 's host cows give birth . Several genetic-engineering firms have gone bust , backing out of business because of high costs and uncertain markets . <p> For about half an hour , as Hemming peered into the microscope , Houston waited patiently . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid we 're only gon na have three or four to transfer . " <p> " You got that figured out already ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> Houston went outside to fenced pens that surround the sheet-metal embryo transfer barn . He picked out four host heifers . Ranch hands later moved these cows into restraining chutes and , using a silver injector , squirted one fertilized embryo into each . In about 50 days , No.150 would be tapped for more . <p> BEN Houston 's dream when he was Skylar 's age was simple : raise a healthy family and run a ranch . After the Korean War , he had neither . He worked for other men selling cattle . <p> Houston always had it in his mind " to try to make an improvement in beef cattle genetics . It was something I always had an interest in and felt I could do and wanted to do . " <p> He walked into a Longmont bank one day , back when bankers made loans based more on character than on balance sheets . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ranching was more or less what he still says today . <p> " Our industry needs improvement , " Houston said . " We 're being pursued by poultry and pork so fast that if we do n't improve our consistency and efficiency , we might lose the marketplace . " <p> He always managed to succeed , and never lost heart , even in 1966 when a tractor crushed his knee . He gives credit to his family . His son , Scott , handles one cattle herd , as well as the oil beneath some fields . Daughter Pam helps run the embryo transfer center . Daughter Diane and her husband farm corn . Nita does just about everything . <p> Houston says he wants his children and eight grandchildren to continue ranching , though he 's never held them back from cosmopolitan pleasures . Once in Los Angeles , a prospective buyer met Houston at the airport in a Maserati sports car . Houston 's daughter Diane was turning 16 , and he wanted to get her a car . He asked the man how much a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and Houston nearly committed to buy one . <p> " I thought he meant 2,500 , " Houston said . He bought Diane a Ford convertible . <p> Colorado 's booming Front Range is closing to ranching , he knows . Oil and gas companies will have to use land carefully , the way most ranchers do , Houston said . <p> Eventually , Houston said , his children " will probably need to relocate into less populous areas . " <p> ROUNDUPS are a big part of ranch life . One recent morning , Houston drove his Chevy Blazer up to some ranch hands on horses . They were rounding up cows that had bruised their hooves on bumpy terrain . Longs Peak shimmered in the distance , and a big orange flame from a gas processing station burned against the blue sky . <p> But , increasingly , roundups at the Aristocrat Angus Ranch are more likely to involve embryos and ultrasound machines . <p> Six weeks after the four fertilized embryos were taken from cow No.150 , ranch hands herded eight " host " heifers into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof , at the embryo transfer center . Greg Leonhardt shot two cows with tranquilizers to calm them before the exams . One by one , he and Hemming prodded them into a restraining chute . <p> They were all carrying embryos from No.150 . Some of the embryos were taken earlier last year . <p> " We like to see females , " said Houston . " That 's what keeps us in business . You have to have a good female to have a <p> good male . All good bulls have good mothers . " <p> The first cow , No.273 , locked her legs and refused to enter the chute . The men yanked her tail , but she did n't move until Hemming finally used a cattle prod . <p> Once she was in the chute , he inserted the black , flashlight-sized ultrasonic probe , which was attached to a white box resembling a television set on a table . As Hemming moved the probe inside the cow 's uterus , he watched the screen . He saw a dark splotch in the uterus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was growing . <p> " Did n't take , " Hemming said , shaking his head . <p> Neither did embryos in two other cows . Three of the four new embryos had died . <p> The last of the new mothers was No.270 , a 1,000 pound Black Angus . Hemming grinned as he looked at the screen . The embryo was moving . You could see a heart beating on the screen . " One pregnancy is better than none , " he said . <p> The four cows carrying embryos implanted last summer were pregnant . No.4731 mooed wildly and banged her head sideways in the chute . Hemming struggled to keep the probe inside her , placing a metal bar behind her back legs . <p> At the same time , on the screen , a tiny fetus was mooing wildly . <p> Spring will show whether Houston and his men have put the right cows and bulls together . Everything makes sense on paper . But Houston says he 's always eager to look at baby calves that he engineered . <p> " I guess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do better than the animal 's mother and father , " he said . <p> " It 's always a relief when a calf is born and takes its first breath .

This is the 17th year the award has been given in connection with the National Western Stock Show &; Rodeo . Houston will be honored at a dinner tomorrow night at the Westin Tabor Center Hotel . Proceeds from the dinner will benefit the National Western Scholarship Fund .
