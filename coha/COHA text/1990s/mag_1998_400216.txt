Plus 24 other round-the-campfire brain stumpers every nature buf should know . // Wisdom , some wise guy once said , is its own reward . Well , call me a craven materialist , but I 'd rather have the Reese 's Pieces . Let me explain . My hiking buddies and I like to pass time in camp trying to one-up each other with our " knowledge " of everything from backcountry diseases to astronomy . To make things interesting , we ante up whatever we find in our gorp bags : raisins , peanuts , the usual . When the stakes get high , we pull out the Reese 's Pieces . On the fourth day of a six-day trek , those little buggers are worth more than any $100 casino chips . So when I first started ferreting out the following fun nature facts , I could n't help but picture myself burdened with booty , cackling with peanut-butter breath at my ill-informed friends . But then my cravings gave way to something more satisfying : an appreciation for the mysteries of the wilderness we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the same for you , making your next trip more enlightening , safer , and , yes , a little sweeter . 1 . Can I eat bark ? " Sure you can , or at least the cambium layer just beneath the bark , but why would you ? " asks Christopher Nyerges , author of In the Footsteps of Our Ancestors : Guide to Wild Foods . While the bark of trees such as alder , birch , and willow can be munched in an emergency , there are many wild foods far more palatable , Nyerges notes . The most readily available edibles include any type of grass or true cactus ( not agave or century plant ) , any fresh seaweed , all members of the mustard family , and acorns after they are husked and boiled to remove the bitter tannic acid . 2 . Why do birds fly in a " V " ? Like feathery stealth bombers , flocks fly in wedges for aerodynamic reasons , explains Karen Johnson , past president of the San Fernando Valley Audubon Society . Each birdexcept for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front . When the lead bird tires out , it switches places with a " wingman . " Formation flying may increase the range of a flock as much as 70 percent over that of a bird flying solo . Such V-flying may also allow birds to maintain visual contact and avoid collisions , Johnson adds . 3 . Why do we need mosquitoes , blackflies , and other bothersome bugs ? // " First , insects are one of the main sources of high-quality food for wildlife , " ; particularly fish and birds , says Lou Bjostad , professor of entomology at Colorado State University in Fort Collins . " Second , many biologists believe that a complex ecosystem including many species of plants and animals is a healthy ecosystem . Mosquitoes and blackflies are simply additional species . " 4 . Does moss really grow on the north side of trees ? Very generally , yes , because moisture-loving moss avoids the heat of southern exposure . But never rely on moss to pinpoint direction ; in cool or dark forests it 's common to find moss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunflower family , such as the common , swamp , and prairie sunflowers , are somewhat more reliable . They follow O1 ' Sol across the sky , facing east in the morning , south at noon and west in the afternoon . 5 . How can owls fly silently and hunt in the dark ? Owls are adapted perfectly to operate after hours . According to Dr. Wes Stone of the Cooperative Wildlife Research Laboratory in Carbondale , Illinois , owls swoop silently because their wing tips are slotted and the leading edges of their flight feathers are serrated . These features disrupt air flow and eliminate noisy wind patterns . Owls hunt effectively at night because their concave face feathers channel sounds to their ears so they can track sounds . Owl eyes also have more rods than cones , enabling them to see in the faintest light . 6 . How and why do fireflies glow ? Fireflies glow when a substance called luciferin mixes with the enzyme luciferase in the tips of their abdomens . Why ? Two reasons , explains CSU 's Bjostad . First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warning to predators . Second , they glow to attract mates . Interestingly , each species of firefly has a specific flash pattern , so some predatory female fireflies are known to mimic the flashes of other species to attract males to .. ahem .. private dinner parties . 7 . How can you tell direction without a compass ? Stand a 3foot stick in the ground where it will cast a shadow . Mark the end of the shadow with a rock . After the shadow moves , mark the new end with another rock . A straight line drawn between the two rocks runs east-west , the first rock marking west . Draw the shortest line between the stick and the east-west line to mark north-south . 8 . Is there a universal bird call ? No , says the Audubon Society 's Johnson . However , some birders swear by " pish , pish , pish " to lure many varieties of birds , such as the song sparrow and common yellowthroat . " This imitates the alarm calls of certain species , which may come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potential predator . " 9 . Why do stars twinkle ? They do n't . Sorry all you romantics , but from our vantage point on Earth stars only appear to glint and glimmer because their light is refracted through hot and cold air in our atmosphere . When viewed from space , stars are steady points of light . 10 . How do I know if a snake is poisonous ? In North America , there are four species of venomous snakes , three of which are pit vipers . All of these pit vipers-rattlesnakes , water moccasins , and copperheads-have relatively large , triangular heads . They also have elliptical irises , but if you can tell that , you 're too close . North America 's other poisonous snake is the coral snake , easily identified by red stripes next to yellow stripes . The harmless king snake has red stripes next to black , which is the origin of the saying , " Red on black , friend of Jack ( or " venom lack " ) ; red on yellow , kill a fellow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , bears are not true hibernators like bats and ground squirrels , reports Dr. Stone . " They often wake up in the winter to briefly prowl around , feed cubs , drink water , or feed themselves . " 12 . What do I do if I encounter a mountain lion ? " Give the lion plenty of room to get away from you . Do not run , " urges Lynn Sadler , executive director of the Mountain Lion Foundation in Sacramento , California . " Do not bend over . Stand your ground and appear as unlike prey as possible . Spread your coattails , hold your hands over your head , speak sternly , throw something . If you are attacked , fight back with anything and everything you have . Lions rely upon surprise and are not known for their stamina . " ( This is contrary to a grizzly attack , when you should cover your neck , play dead and stay as still as possible after the bear has signaled its unfriendly intentions by charging or attacking . ) Sadler notes that small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lions . Bear in mind , of course , that sightings of North America 's largest cat are still extremely rare . 13 . What 's munching on my boots and canoe paddles during the night ? Deer , mice , marmots , and porcupines are attracted to salt deposits , including dried sweat on gear and clothing . Another source that will attract wildlife is the salt left after urine has evaporated . So avoid doing your business on delicate plantlife , especially in alpine areas where salt-seeking goats , sheep , or deer may chew plants and paw the ground to get at the salt . 14 . Why do animals migrate ? For the same primal reason you drive straight to your favorite pizza joint after a week on the trail : " basically to follow food sources and the other amenities of life , " explains Fellows . " They make maximum use of their habitat by going to where they can obtain the requirements of survival and reproduction . " Annual migrations can be measured in hundreds of yards ( bighorn sheep moving down from subalpine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( arctic terns winging 20,000 miles between polar regions ) . 15 . Is there a natural bug repellent ? According to Bjostad , nothing found trailside is as effective as that old standby N , N-diethylmetatoluamide , or DEET . Some folks swear by oil of citronella , which can be purchased commercially . The only organic bug-beater found in the backcountry is mud . 16 . How do I get rid of skunk odor ? The best way to eliminate the funk is to avoid skunks altogether . But if you do get sprayed , washing clothes and gear in a diluted solution of an offthe-shelf douche preparation will do the trick , swears Dave Fellows , a wildlife biologist at the Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center in Jamestown , North Dakota . The staff there even washes their trucks with it . ( Would n't you love to see the expression on the checker at that grocery store . ) How about tomato juice ? That solution is only temporary at best , Fellows says . 17 . And how can I tell when a skunk is agitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornered , offers Marsha Sovada , a wildlife biologist at the Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center , so give them a wide berth . If you are caught between a skunk and a hard place , the animal will first raise its tail . Some skunks will also stamp their front feet before letting loose . 18 . Can a porcupine throw its quills ! That 's a myth , Dr. Stone says . " Despite all the stories , a porcupine 's quills are firmly attached . They can , however , erect their quills by muscular contraction , similar to piloerection ( goose flesh ) in humans when skin gets cold . A naive dog may come home with quills stuck in his nose , but that 's from direct contact , not an airborne assault . " 19 . What are those coyotes howling at ? One reason coyotes howl " is to announce their presence in a territory to other animals , " says Dr. Stone . " In this way they can avoid potentially lethal confrontations and secure exclusive rights to the resources in that territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a pack or to communicate danger from predators such as cougars or wolves . 20 . How do I tell the difference between a black bear and a grizzly ? You certainly ca n't tell by color , because " black " bear hues range from charcoal to cinnamon . If you 're anywhere outside of Canada , Alaska , Colorado , Montana , Wyoming , and Idaho , you 're most likely out of griz country . But just in case , grizzlies ( and their cousins , brown or Kodiak bears ) are usually significantly larger , boast a pronounced shoulder hump , and have larger ears and long claws . 21 . How can crickets tell the temperature , and what other creatures are weather forecasters ? The Weather Channel is more reliable than any critter , but the male snowy tree cricket ( Oecanthus fultoni ) , found in all United States regions except the Southeast , does vary its chirping according to the temperature . Adding 40 to the number of chirps made in 15 seconds provides a close measure of the temperature in degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owls hooting throughout an autumn night are said to be harbingers of a storm , waterfowl usually fly higher in clear weather and lower in stormy weather , and woolly bear caterpillars are supposedly blacker before severe winters . 22 . What do tree rings means , and how do I count them ! In temperate zones , including North America , most trees add a ring every year , making a tree the only organism whose age can be precisely determined . Tree rings enable scientists called dendrochronologists to not only date specimens , but also " interpret how these trees have been treated by mother nature and human activity , " explains Dr. D.W. Larson , a professor of botany at Guelph University in Ontario , Canada . " Each of these long chronologies , as they are called , is a living clock whose ticks are louder or softer as a function of drought , cold , heat , and disturbance . " Certain tree species ' rings are easily identifiable , such as oak , ash , hickory , tamarack , fir , or northern white cedar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light-colored ring ( earlywood ) and a dark-colored ring ( latewood ) . 23 . Can snakes spit venom ? Yes , but thankfully not the ones in this hemisphere , Fellows says . The spitting cobras of Africa have a propensity for defending themselves by squirting a thin stream of venom toward the eyes of an attacker. 24 . Why do leaves change color ? The green pigments known as chlorophyll , which capture energy from the sun , dissipate as the days grow shorter and the nights colder . This lets the yellow , brown , and orange pigments , called carotenoids , already present in the leaf shine through . Red and purple come from anthocyanin pigments , which are produced in sap cells beginning in late summer . 25 . Do opossums really play dead or hang by their tails ? They 'll play " possum " when confronted by an aggressor and are known to secrete a foul-smelling substance like skunks do . As for hanging , young ones do but mature opossums are unable to support themselves by their tails , although they use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reese 's Pieces in the Southern California backcountry. // <p>
