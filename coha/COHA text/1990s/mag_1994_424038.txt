Section : SCIENCE NEWS of the week Tattletale molecules make cells glow <p> As an undergraduate , Roger Y. Tsien disliked his chemistry courses so much that he decided against becoming a chemist . Nevertheless , this biologist has made his mark on science because of his chemical concoctions . <p> With molecules that they build or remodel , Tsien and his colleagues at the University of California , San Diego , carry on intracellular espionage . In fact , they and scientists at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh have pioneered means of tapping into the internal message network that cells use to keep operations running smoothly . <p> Before these advances , scientists were like detectives at a stakeout : They could watch molecular messengers going in and out , but they could only guess at the details of what went on behind the closed doors of the cell membrane . Now researchers can " wire " molecules that sneak in and eavesdrop on a cell 's chemical conversations . " They give us a readout of what the cell is doing inside , " Tsien explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing messages to another part . " <p> Tsien does his watching in the dark-his undercover molecules tip him off to their locations by fluorescing . These spies represent an expanding cadre of glowing reagents designed to track key chemicals and reveal changes in a cell 's interior . To decipher their messages , Tsien relies on sophisticated microscopy as well as special image-processing techniques . Thus , he can detect subtle changes in fluorescence and piece discrete bits of information into a comprehensive picture of cellular activity . <p> Likewise , researchers at the Center for Light Microscope Imaging and Biotechnology at Carnegie Mellon University develop their own fluorescing molecules and work to improve the technology for monitoring these agents . Together , the two research groups have provided tools that enable researchers to follow events inside the cell minute by minute and perhaps eventually to manipulate those activities . <p> <p> When Carnegie Mellon 's D. Lansing Taylor first decided to use fluorescent dyes , he simply wanted to track the intracellular movements of a molecule called actin . So in 1978 he created double agents  --  copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cell , these fluorescent analogs mix with the cell 's natural actin . Because the analogs glow , they reveal to researchers the location of actin within a cell . <p> Tsien wanted his molecular spies to do more than just tail proteins , so he decided to build them from scratch . His first goal : an optical sensor that would let him know when calcium was released into the cell 's interior . That molecule and others subsequently developed by Tsien and by Taylor 's group represent the new generation of sensors  --  molecules able to monitor changes in the local internal environment of a cell . <p> Calcium is a key messenger in the body . It prompts nerve cells to fire and muscles to contract . It turns enzymes on and off and helps activate the immune system . When sperm and egg first meet , the egg releases a burst of calcium ions into its interior . Other cells use calcium to commit suicide : The calcium activates enzymes that cut up proteins and lipids vital to cell survival . <p> But as a nondescript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Designing a sensor therefore proved a tough job that spanned almost seven years . For one thing , the sensor needed a fluorescent tag , a dye that would respond strongly , yet selectively when the spy molecule encountered calcium . <p> The molecule also needed negative charges to attract the positive calcium ion . The sensor had to be small enough to squeeze into all the nooks and crannies of a cell where calcium might lurk and picky enough to bind to calcium ions but not to magnesium , another positively charged ion of similar size . " And we needed it to be able to reject magnesium by a factor of 100,000 , " says Tsien . In addition , the molecule had to work efficiently ; that way , Tsien would n't need to add so many spy molecules that they would disturb the cell 's natural chemical balance . <p> Finally , he and his colleagues had to figure out a way to smuggle these sensors into a cell . Injecting them one by one seemed too tedious , yet the molecule 's negative charges rendered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could just wriggle its way inside . <p> Tsien first surveyed the chemical literature and discovered one chelator molecule that snagged calcium preferentially over magnesium in alkaline conditions . To make that molecule fluoresce and work in a cell 's more acidic environment , he attached ever more complex side groups , eventually finding some that emitted enough fluorescence that even a single cell 's worth could be detected . <p> To solve the access problem , Tsien borrowed chemical technology developed by pharmaceutical companies to help the gut take up antibiotics . By adding water-repelling side groups called esters to his sensors , he effectively covered up the negatively charged parts of these molecules so they could get through the lipid layers of the cell membrane . " After they get inside , the cell cuts the esters off , " he explains . <p> These molecular intruders helped decipher many secrets . They revealed that individual liver cells respond differently to adrenaline . Under the microscope , these cells pulse about once a minute as they release calcium . Other types of cells show a sharp rise in calcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd never be able to catch this with traditional biochemistry , " Tsien says . " We now have the ability to see individual cells and recognize their individual personalities . " <p> <p> Taylor , too , decided to follow calcium activity , but from a different perspective . To do so , he made copies of a protein called calmodulin . When it binds to calcium , it starts activating enzymes and thus serves as an intermediate messenger that amplifies chemical cascades inside a cell . Taylor and Carnegie colleagues Alan S. Waggoner and Klaus M. Hahn linked a fluorescent dye to calmodulin , creating a " biosensor " called MeroCaM , he explains . When MeroCaM encounters calcium , it undergoes a three-fold change in excitation ratio , a comparative measurement of fluorescence that compensates for distortions that arise during imaging . <p> " This was the first example of engineering a protein with a fluorescent probe to create a biosensor for living cells , " says Taylor . " We can now track where in the cell calmodulin is binding calcium . " <p> By injecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stimulating those cells with certain growth factors , the researchers confirmed that higher concentrations of free calcium correlated with increased activity by this protein . They also determined that this activity varied from cell to cell . <p> When the scientists trained their microscope on single cells , they could also discern , by means of a technique called ratio imaging , that calcium-carrying calmodulin shows up first just inside the cell membrane . Calmodulin then appears sporadically ever closer to the nucleus , the Carnegie Mellon group reported in the Oct. 22 , 1992 NATURE . <p> The researchers then examined activity in cells involved in wound healing . They injured a layer of fibroblast cells with a razor blade and injected both MeroCaM and a calcium indicator . In cells that crept toward the wound , they observed that calcium concentrations and calmodulin activity were highest at the rear of the cell and lowest at the leading edge . Another fluorescent marker revealed that , at the site of all this activity , fibers stretching from one side of the cell to the other contracted and helped pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calcium and , more recently , hydrogen , sodium , and acidity now under chemical surveillance by physiologists all over the world , Tsien and Taylor turned their attention to spying on more complex cellular messengers . Their recent successes attest to the power of combining protein engineering with fluorescence chemistry and of harnessing molecular biology to churn out lots of promising biosensors . <p> About a decade ago , Tsien targeted cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) , a key molecule that can activate enzymes in a cell or its nucleus . After several years of sizing up and rejecting different proteins as markers for cAMP , he settled on a protein kinase enzyme . Two " catalytic " subunits and two " regulatory " subunits make up the inactive form . When the enzyme links up with cAMP , however , it splits and frees the catalytic units to chop apart other proteins . <p> Tsien took advantage of this splitting behavior in making his cAMP biosensor . He attached one dye , fluorescein , to the catalytic subunits and a second dye , rhodamine , to the regulatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when it gets close to rhodamine , however , it transfers its energy , causing the rhodamine to fluoresce bright orange . Thus as long as the kinase remains intact , it glows orange . When cAMP breaks the enzyme apart , the glow changes to yellow-green and reveals that the enzyme has been activated . Tsien called this new biosensor FlCRhR . <p> <p> Tsien put this signaling system to the test . In one experiment , he and Brian J. Bacskai , also at San Diego , injected the tagged kinase enzyme into nerve cells from a sea hare . Working with Beni Hochner of Columbia University in New York City , they then bathed the nerve cells in a neurotransmitter called serotonin , which stimulates the production of cAMP . <p> The color changes surprised them . Scientists had not known where nerve cells make cAMP . In this experiment , where the neurotransmitter washed over the entire cell , Tsien expected that cAMP would appear all over . Instead , " the cyclic AMP goes up quite locally , " Tsien reported at the November 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , held in San Diego . <p> Even in this neurotransmitter bath , the yellow-green indicated that the cell made cAMP first at the nerve-cell tips , where it cleaved the inactive kinase into its active subunits . The migration of the yellow-green glow then indicated that over several hours the catalytic subunits diffused into the nucleus , presumably to activate genes that might then dictate longer term changes in the cell 's chemistry . <p> " These observations are of extremely great value , " says Eric Kandel , a neurobiologist at Columbia University in New York City . He uses sea hares to study the molecular basis of memory . The results are " giving us initial ideas about how short-term processes can lead to longterm processes , " he adds . <p> In addition , Tsien and his San Diego researchers noticed that when cAMP levels declined , the catalytic subunits gradually vacated the nucleus and eventually relinked with their regulatory counterparts , says Tsien . The fluorescence shifted back to orange . <p> <p> More recently , Taylor 's group has co-opted a different protein , myosin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass. , used genetic engineering to alter one amino acid in myosin . They inserted a cysteine near where myosin takes on a phosphate . This phosphate activates the protein . The added cysteine readily latches onto a fluorescent dye that changes color when the myosin links up with phosphate , Taylor explains . <p> With this modified myosin , Taylor hopes to examine how free-form cells such as white blood cells move . Other research suggests that contractile fibers containing these myosin molecules form at the front of the cell , move toward the nucleus , and then contract . Thus it seems that phosphate-bearing myosin at the rear of the cell may help propel the cell forward . " We 're beginning to test that , " he says . The new biosensor will indicate whether a gradient of phosphorylation correlates with increased fiber activity . <p> Taylor and his colleagues have already demonstrated that they can sneak several simple fluorescent analogs into a cell at once . Now they hope to insert four or five kinds of molecular optical biosensors . The multicolored images that result should document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responds to chemical cues from its environment . <p> " The theory is that if you can map these changes in time and space as the cell functions , then you can define the mechanism of the cell 's processes , " Taylor says . That approach contrasts with studies in which biochemists have to grind up the cell before they can measure concentrations of certain chemicals . <p> As more scientists become aware of the potential of these techniques , use of them should escalate . " You can design and synthesize fluorescent probes sensitive to many environments , " Taylor says . " By combining the probes with proteins , you take advantage of that chemistry and of molecular biology . This is a major new direction for this technology . " <p> He also expects that these research tools will prove useful for screening new drugs , testing the toxicity of substances , and possibly diagnosing disease . <p> Already , these glowing molecules have proven quite popular . Thousands of scientific reports involving Tsien 's calcium marker have been published . Both he and Taylor have spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with help in using them . <p> Nevertheless , such demands have their rewards . <p> " Our ultimate motivation is to understand the biology , " says Tsien . " But to some extent , our major contribution is making these molecules . Very few biologists want to build these molecules , but lots want to use them . <p> " Their aggregate contribution is greater than what we ourselves could ever do .
