silver on the mantle and lit each one . They scorched the wall . Even our best sofas could n't make up for the cheesy , rundown way the wall looked now . Still , this was London , not New York , and my mother did n't even seem to notice . She was on a date . Derek Duncalf , the anesthesiologist , wrapped his legs down around the last curve of the love seat . My mother bent over , pushed a log back inside the grate . I was saying hello . <p> " Hello , Dr. Duncalf . " <p> My mother said that Derek Duncalf put his patients under by talking to them . But his tedious droning did n't cure him from occasionally leaping across all obstacles to pin my mother to the wall . My mother liked this . She enjoyed the telling of it . She giggled and described his whining and pleading . Their dance of love was set . She would never give in ; he would sleep , then spring , then be rebuffed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees in first budding , wired into fanciful shapes . They leaned against the empire mirror in the foyer , and my mother would sniff at them , then snore , then laugh . <p> We were waiting for my father . My father had a small bachelor flat not a block away from us on Upper Brook Street . Every day he would pass by on his way to the office , on his way home . Sometimes he would stop in for a drink . All his things were still with us , half-packed in bags , a favorite painting taken down from the wall , rehung , taken down . Six months of this , eight months , nine months . My mother began to date . My mother began to wear falls  --  hair attached from the crown of her head that ran down the length of her spine . She loved to wear hot pants and silk shirts and lace-up boots and false eyelashes and brown lipstick and no bra . And though I could see only her faults , the thickness of her upper arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came regularly to her living room . <p> One day Derek brought a friend , Dr. Dan Ovita . Dr. Ovita was from Israel . My mother made a huge fire in the marble fireplace . The flames traced wild shadows on the silver of her caftan . My mother tossed her fall from right to left , and Dr. Dan Ovita studied her and me . He studied us both , and his gaze made us forget to look out the window at half past six to determine whether my father would be coming for cocktails that day . As it happened , he did n't , not that day , not the next . <p> Dr. Dan Ovita talked about the war in Israel . The war was fresh . The soldiers were young men and women not much older than me . They were fighting to keep their homeland . Dr. Dan Ovita was the most famous hand surgeon in Israel . He told us that hands were more fragile than butterflies , and when he was able to fix a mortified palm , it seemed a miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he said about hands . My own hands were being leeched of their delicacy by the stones I was gaining . Stones . In London we weighed ourselves in stones  --  pounds were for money . No amount of dieting , and diet aids , and worse things  --  abrading my own throat-could help me . It did n't matter . I was getting bigger by the day . My breasts bloomed . But I saw them as two folds among many . By the time my father had been in his bachelor flat a full nine months , I was heavier by seven and a half stones , fifty-four pounds , a pound and a half for every week he had deserted us . <p> My mother explained : My father needed to forget . We reminded him of all the things he could no longer stand to think of . Without us to remind him , those bad memories shrank and disappeared . He forgot my baby brother 's death , he forgot the false indictment , jail , he forgot betrayals and infidelities . He forgot the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , then did , falling from a second-story window . Not so far to fall , but still , she died . Without us , my father was beginning life all over again . He was brand-new , my mother said . He still missed us as people , though , and that 's why he visited without calling first , as if he still lived with us . He used his own key , he showered and changed , he smoked and made phone calls . Each time , after he left , my mother found reason to hit me . Once she punched my right breast , and the sensation in that nipple flew away for good . <p> Dr. Dan Ovita told me that sometimes the men and women 's hands he operated on blossomed like flowers . They became saturated with feeling . Patients took up painting who 'd never noticed the color of anything before . People played piano and guitar and mandolins and their families felt haunted and grateful at the same time . One patient who could neither paint nor fathom a tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ovita was talking about physical therapy , not magic . There was nothing magical about Dr. Ovita , which was why I liked him . He never disappeared ; he never changed shape . <p> One evening Derek Duncalf and Dr. Ovita drank grappa with my mother . They were celebrating because Dr. Ovita had convinced many surgeon-volunteers to go to Israel for three-month rotations . By the end of the week he 'd be home setting up field hospitals on the borders . They all nibbled on tiny sandwiches I made of pressed-down brown bread and watercress . Their stomachs were barely lined by such things , and the grappa felled them each like a tree . Derek Duncalf 's boneless legs rippled down to the floor , and I thought his shoe might catch fire , it was so close to the flames . But Dr. Dan Ovita repositioned Derek 's body like a kindly choreographer might before melting himself into a graceful puddle on the carpet . My mother 's head flipped to the left , one of her breasts scrubbed against her blouse . Under brown silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pot . That scared me . I could n't help but run my tongue over my inner cheeks , though she 'd never nursed me . Then I went to bed . <p> Even I was asleep when my father came the next morning to find his blue tie . But I heard him weeping , as I had so often in my dreams . My father 's crying sounded like the most deserted baby 's , a howling , choking wail . I found him on the side of the bathtub holding his blue tie . He said he did n't understand . He just did n't understand . I felt afraid to touch him . His mouth looked swollen . <p> " Daddy . " <p> " Do n't , " he said . <p> The only things I could think to say were old things , good things . More things he could n't stand us for . Especially me . I remembered everything . <p> I went to find my mother . The curtains were only half-pulled in the master bedroom . Light slipped in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants crinkled , wedged at the tops of her thighs , stockings all snagged . Her fall lay at the foot of the bed like a dead dog . Derek Duncalf was stripped completely , and his body had little contour , just flesh and hair and a short stub of a penis I could barely stand to look at . He smelled like smoked salmon . I had to stop breathing when I leaned across him to shake my mother . She sat up , and her breasts fell into order , the nipples perfect . My father 's sobs from the bathroom pulled her toward him , just as she was , like a sleepwalker . <p> Her hair sprouted in tufts around her face . She pulled my father 's fingers from his eyes . His hands were the best part of him . She held them like eggs , very still between her own . My father 's face smoothed to a wet red calmness . My mother called him sweet George over and over , which is not his name , not a name I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from her seat on the bidet , he from the lip of the tub . Their bodies made an imperfect arch . I backed out , feeling nauseous , the nausea my mother might have felt when first carrying me . I passed my own bathroom with the green ivy paper climbing to the ceiling , all the way up and across the ceiling , and I passed on the opportunity to suffer my own hand reaching into my throat . I dressed for school . On the way out I wrote a brief note and stuffed it into the pocket of the folded , sleeping Dr. Ovita . " I 'm coming with you , " I wrote . <p> And Dr. Ovita agreed . My parents said okay , I could go to school in Israel , learn another language . But school is not a big deal to me . In summers I help pitch tents for the surgeons , and I am never afraid . In winter I come to this kibbutz , where I am famous for my cooking and have a soldier-lover with hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I laugh . My hair is very long . I wear a bra as soft as a blanket . My lover speaks to my breast in Hebrew . His guttural sound will surely raise it from the dead . And when I write my parents , my father signs each reply : Our love . <p> <p> By Mary-Beth Hughes <p>
