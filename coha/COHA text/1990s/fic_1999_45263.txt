First of August . . . I am walking , but it is not me . It is memory walking . Memory leading my limbs through these twisting calle as if it were only yesterday . As if it were n't only two hours since I landed , two years since I last searched these stones for a pattern , a path . This is how time works-one foot in front of the other one breath after another passage . There is no other choice , is there ? One may only advance by degrees here . You never can tell what 's around the next corner , ca n't rely solely on your eyes nor what you 've come to trust of perspective . . . Up ahead , the stalls of Rialto , empty crates stacked along the fondamenta . The smell of fish , cheeses . A shopkeeper nods at me . The one who once sold me my asiago and gorgonzola , my mascarpone . He remembers , too . Steps back for the moment , riddles his brow . Winks at the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tides , the carrots , the onions . . . Venice . La Serenissima . Thousand year empire . Refuge from the Huns . Shimmer floating between sea and sky . Mirage . Dream . Yet even here , in this shrine of a city , there is a date . A clock steadily ticking . Even here . . . <p> This was not the first time I 'd returned to Venice . In fact , hers were shores I could n't keep from returning to , a place where I could always come to float and disappear for a while-half labyrinth , half harbor , safely buffetted from both tides and time . Adding up all the days and months , I 'd passed nearly three years of my life there , though of course it 's ridiculous to quantify time in Venice . To try and fix a number to a page or talk in terms of calendars . Drift along any of her murmuring canals late of an evening and you 'll see what I mean . Aside from the occasional light bulb , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different trip . One of brief duration and even briefer purpose . A Venice of sudden limits and hesitation . A Venice I 'd returned to in order to see an ailing friend before he died . <p> Alessandro was the first Venetian I 'd ever befriended . Early on , he 'd taken me on little expeditions , revealing niches only a native would know-secret shortcuts and tiny candlelit shrines , dark doorways where opera divas slipped away from their adoring fans , abandoned docks where the dead were once piled high during the plagues . He was also the first friend I 'd ever had who was zero positive . <p> Perhaps this is why our friendship blossomed so quickly , so urgently . Or perhaps this is also why I 'd delayed returning for so long . At times denial is a powerful ally . At times the eye prefers not to see what 's around the corner . <p> For the first two days I walked the streets and bridges half-dazed by the brightness and swelter , the mass of moving bodies . I 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , and the very city seemed strained under the weight of the crowds . As I boarded a vaporetto , I could literally feel the boat shudder as it shunted from the dock . I was heading out toward the beach at Lido to lie in the sun , gradually reacquainting myself with the sea-like rhythms of the city-afternoons at the beach ebbing into sunset , evening strolls along canals , wet moonlight lapping against stone . <p> At least that 's what I kept telling myself . On the third day I faced the fact that I was sleeping past midday , then gorging myself on bread and cafe latte , then wandering till I could again sleep . This was n't reacquaintance nor ritual nor jet lag , but pure avoidance . That afternoon I finally dialed Aless 's phone number . <p> Pronto ? <p> " Si , si pronto . It 's me . . . " Marc . <p> " Ah , finalmente , " said Aless 's sister <p> " Si . Sono arrivato . Sono stato ... " I started to make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , it 's good the time . Aless returned yesterday from hospital . " <p> I wondered if that was good or bad news . As far as I knew , he 'd only lost most of his eyesight thus far , but that information was already weeks old . <p> " Si , e a casa , " she said . " He is home . Now he sleeps , but . . . " <p> I recognized a tiny tremor in her voice . The same as in the message recently left on my phone machine across the ocean . " Things are falling apart , " she 'd said , " if you 're coming , then come fast . " I tried to formulate a decent question in my mind . Does he know I 'm coming ? Will he recognize me ? Can he see at all ? Leave bed ? All around me young bodies were sunning themselves , running across the beach , eating gelati . The telephone clicked and I deposited another coin . <p> " Ma dove sei ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " But where do you stay ? " <p> " With a friend . I 'm OK I 'm OK , " I said , then with embarassment added , " I 'm just here , at the Lido . " " Ah , Lido . . . " <p> I waited for her to say more , then just blurted it out . " Look , can he see me ? I mean , can I see him ? " <p> But she did n't respond , her mother at that moment taking the receiver away . <p> " Vieni da mangiare con noi , " she said . " Va bene ? Stasera . Vieni e basta . " " OK , " I said . " OK , " and hung up . <p> A meal , I thought . Una cena . Good idea . Something to divert the attention , something simple . Yes , I was making this much too complex . Enough with all these questions and preparations . A simple dinner with my friend and my friend 's family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beach . I watched the people along the shoreline . A mother being splashed by her daughter . Longwaisted men . German tourists , Japanese . Grains of sand . <p> Before the sun began to sink I walked back to the other side of the island toward the boats . Across the lagoon I could see the outline of Venice 's horizon of steeples-particularly the great curving cupola of the Salute , built as a votive to the Virgin for ending the great plague of 1630 . Beneath her foundation a million pilings held her fast and afloat . Was n't Venice still a city of miracles ? A survivor of catastrophes , flood , contagion ? I stopped into a shop and bought a trayful of pastries to bring for dessert , selecting ones I knew Aless liked . Then I went next door and set the package on the bar . I ordered a wine , then drank a second . <p> I remember one of the last times I went to visit my father before he died . Finally died , I should say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember the evening 's weather was raw and raining , and when the commuter train finally stopped , its doors opened onto a deep grey mist . I could hardly see my hands let alone the platform , and in that moment of taking that blind step I knew he would not survive . I stood immobile on that cement platform for several minutes , the air thick , suffocating . I imagined this was how it might feel to be in a coma . How dying itself might be . Finally a rush of wind came , a glowing train speeding by in the opposite direction and off to my left a glimpsed stairwell . <p> Alessandro 's family lived on the top floor of an apartment building not far from Venice 's bus and train stations . In its courtyard stood an old stone well , covered over centuries ago . I rang the bell and looked up . The last of the sun still shone on the fourth floor , bathing Alessandro 's sister 's face orange when she momentarily leaned out the window . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairwell beyond that door possessed the same precise quality of grey as had that train platform . Its walls and its dust , thick and suffocating . It was as if all the fading dusk had been sucked toward the upper floors like the last light draining from a room just before the candle expires . <p> " Marc ? Marco , is that you ? " <p> " Yes , yes I 'm coming . " <p> I climbed the stairs , flight after flight , growing heavier and breathless with each step . Finally I reached the upper floor , where their apartment door stood ajar . The thought raced through my head that I could still run . I could still . . . the sound of utensils from within , whispers . I pushed open the door and stepped inside . An umbrella leaned against the wall , a pair of shoes nearby without laces . In the kitchen , bowls of minestrone sat steaming on the table beneath upturned faces . <p> " We waited , but . . . " <p> " Oh no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Across the table sat Alessandro silhouetted before the still bright window . I could n't see his face , only the outline of his head-the hair much shorter than I remembered , the ears pointed , his neck and shoulders drawn . He was n't wearing a shirt . As I grew accustomed to the light I noticed his whole body was listing , his right arm bent at an odd angle . He was seated in a wheelchair . A yellow wheelchair . <p> " Siediti . Siediti , " said his mother , and placed a bowl before me . <p> I set down my backpack and reached for a chair back . Broken bread lay on the table . A bottle of wine . Salt . I sat down and inched my chair forward . No one spoke for a full minute , then Alessandro 's father pushed a spoon into his son 's hand . I watched my friend blindly struggle to find the edge of his soup bowl . After several clinking attempts , he succeeded and awkwardly raised his spoon . Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Half the liquid ran down his cheek and splashed the tablecloth . <p> Aless 's sister quickly dabbed her napkin to his face , and said , " Look who came to see you , Aless ? " <p> " Si , " said his father . " II tuo amico Americano . " Aless tilted his head to the side like a bird trying to see something before him . I suddenly realized I had n't gone to embrace him . <p> 4 Agosto . Morning after and remembering one can again wake however begrudgingly to the vertical . To the living . To soft voices and footsteps outside the shuttered window . To notice the slice of sun between the shutters and go out and buy a handful of apricots and bread and walk along a street shaded by hanging laundry and cypress , and sit by an open window with a hot cup of coffee . And that there is even music . And yet . . <p> After one visit , gone is all my anxiety , my romanticism of a mission here . And what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions . End time . It seems I am already too late . Oh , he 's still alive , but . . . there 's no will left , no friction . Beyond blindness , beyond paralysis , a kind of dementia . Doing only what he is told now . Operating purely on reflexes . To eat , to drink , to bring whatever 's placed in his hand to his mouth-the sugar container , the ashtray-to not even realize that he is or is n't drinking . I sat there hardly able to move , to speak , to place nor extract myself . I fear my presence only makes things worse . The tension in that room , like that moment after dinner after his father lit a cigarette and placed it in his fist . That silence , the whole room 's focus on the lengthening , dangling ash . <p> 4 Agosto . Evening . Went back today . Forced myself to try again and harder Sat alone with him in his childhood room for most of the afternoon and it seemed more bearable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He kept drifting in and out , but there were tiny moments of awareness . A sudden frustration that he could n't remember something . A smile , a genuine response . A shared moment from out of our past . I think that 's the hardest part . This mooring of memory . The weight of it , the sheer and sudden beauty of it compared to what now sat in the room . I somehow ca n't connect the two . Ca n't accept such decay . I sat and read to him from a book I found on the shelf-The Little Prince . His one good hand in mine , his palm sweating as he fell asleep . The tattoos on his fingers , the fan banking back and forth , the stifling heat . . <p> No , I take it back . The hardest part is coming back out into the world . To recall that there is another world going on at the same time-and that I could enter it at will . The sensation for the moment-culpevole . I do n't think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother once , or almost did . He came and went before I was born , so we never actually met . Never shared any actual time together face-to-face in a room . Indeed I did n't even learn about him until I was nearly eleven , when my mother sat me down in the kitchen one evening . I remember our dirty dinner plates were still on the table . I remember carrots , too . The kind that came cubed in a can . The way they still sat in a clump at the edge of my plate , pushed aside and cold . <p> He was born with a broken heart . Literally . A hole down its center , the pulmonary veins and arteries transposed and twisted on themselves-its beating irregular , choked . My mother paused before speaking . I remember that , too . The way she slid the tag from the tea bag between her teeth like a toothpick . The way her words came out , slow and deliberate . The very sparseness of those words , those details : that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept in an oxygen tent , and that the box he was buried in was very , very small-more like the size of something you 'd expect to put in the ground to grow . <p> What I remember most , however , is how it all made sudden sense . This shadow that had always hovered over our home , this ever-stalking presence behind me , finally explained . It is to this that I trace the source of my full-fathomed fear of loss . <p> 5 Agosto . Lido . Out here floating in the Adriatic like a piece of driftwood . The sky a marble of blue and cloud veins . Is this how it will be , to die to float to release to currents . To know no difference between sea and sky ? <p> 6 Agosto . OK , enough of this self-bemoaning . Sure you 're tired , sapped , but what of him ? What of his fear , his exhaustion , the amount of energy necessary just to hold up his head . Imagine what he can and ca n't stop thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little trip . You 'll come and give your little handshakes and hugs , your little comforts . . . and then you 'll leave . Leave them to sweep up the mess . To collect the piss pots and dishes and tears and finally , the body . Leave them the weight of having to call you with the ultimate news . That awkward silence , that utter silence . You 'll pack and go back to your little life having saved nothing , changed nothing . Risked nothing but the price of plane fare . . . All these things you wanted to discuss , to bridge , your so-called closure-all too late . You comfort only yourself , and cheaply . <p> There are over one hundred forty bridges in Venice-and most of them , no matter how small , with their own popular names and yarns . Amidst the maze of islands and alleyways that comprise the city they are your only hope of getting anywhere . Yet the bridges of Venice span not only space , but time as well . Touch their railings or worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , of stone . But do n't be too sure of yourself , of that which you 're touching being solid , of history . For Venice above all is not about bridges but about water , and water is a dream , an illusion . The murky womb we never ever leave . It is not ashes and dust that we return to , but water . There is no land in Venice , only pilings . Only more illusions . There is nowhere to get to in Venice , at least not in any hurry . A mere walk to the market can take a decade . Venice reveals how we often move , as if in a maze . Setting out with a goal , a destination , then somehow finding we 've circled back to where we began . There are no straight canals nor streets in Venice . Like rivers they meander because that is the path of least resistance . The path I 'd chosen my whole life . <p> I was staying at the same friend 's apartment where I 'd once lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard belonging to the Frari , one of two major monastic churches in Venice . Each morning , I used to open the window shutters and listen to the bells calling mass and watch the church gardener rake his rows of radicchio and fennel . He had a dog , a German shepherd , who would sometimes bay for days in heat . Afternoons , a certain monk would pace the circumference of the yard , his arms clasped behind his brown robe . At dusk the gardener would stand by the open back door and stare at the next day 's work . <p> Standing at the window again , I remembered how one day my friend had come into the room to retrieve laundry from outside the window . <p> " Good morning , " she 'd said . <p> " Giorno . " <p> " It is beautiful morning , no ? " <p> " Si , una bella giornata . " <p> We traded each other 's languages , part of our rental agreement . <p> " How do you say il contadino ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " you watch the gardener ? " <p> " Are you watching the gardener ? Si , lo guardo . " <p> " It is fascinating , no , how he works with one arm ? " " Cosa ? " <p> " With one arm . You see ? He has one arm only . " <p> I looked down and noticed the way the rake handle was wedged under one shoulder , the opposite arm hanging limp at his side . I suddenly realized why he always leaned his tools against his chest to toss a ball to his dog , to wave . My friend gathered her sheets and napkins and clothespins . <p> " It is better for you to close the windows , is very humid . You come take a cafe ? " <p> " Huh ? Oh yes , yes , " I said , but did not move . <p> I heard her slippers shuffle away behind me , cupboards opening and closing in the kitchen . The gardener moved toward the far end of the yard and checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left shoulder as he walked , the frozen fingers of his prosthesis pointing to the earth . For months I had watched him . For months . <p> There are all kinds of amputations and oversights in this world . All kinds of cripples . The water accepts them all without reservation , yet the solid world has little tolerance . Even Venice . At some point in the past that gardener must have been careless , inattentive . Just as Alessandro had been in that moment he shared a needle . Just as I was being careless by way of being too careful . Careful in friendships , love , you name it . Always keeping my measured distance , staving off not only loss , but life in the process . <p> No doubt Venice is forgiving in her shadows , and the lame may well be sheltered within her church walls and courtyards , but we ca n't stay there forever . The world turns , with or without us . Outside the window , there was no longer any gardener nor dog and the rows of vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was time to move forward . Wheelchairs or no wheelchairs , my friend was lying in a bed awaiting me and each and every moment the tide was turning . My chance was now . Now . <p> 7 Agosto . Near midnight . Spent the evening with Alessandro and his family . Today , his birthday . Thirty-five . His mother cooked all his favorites : risi e bisi , sarde in saor , peoci-a fish fest . Aless 's brother was there too , all joking and laughing , and it was n't a nervous laughter either No , he was choosing to be upbeat . True he is n't there day to day sustaining it , but still . . . It makes me think this is how I should be for the rest of them too , how I could be reacting . And yet ... Every day Aless loses something ; a word , a phrase , the capacity to blow his nose . And today ? The chance for another birthday . Looking across the table at Aless 's brother a thought crossed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two of us , brothers in loss . And it occurred to me that in a way Aless had become the brother I never had . The brother I would once again never have . <p> 8 Agosto . Worse today . He kept falling forward in the chair . Trouble drinking , too . He 'd breathe in , causing hiccups . So self-disgusted today , apologizing when wheeled back from the bathroom . If found myself losing it at the kitchen table . His sister too . A nurse came this afternoon with shots , his arm already a pin cushion of bruises . Usually I 'm OK once I get inside the apartment , but somehow just could n't bear it today . That sad , half smile of his-the paralysis hideous , mocking . That smell of ammonia , of death lurking . I ca n't do this . I ca n't do this . <p> The next day I opted for visiting another friend , an old retired stevedore-Rico delle Scimmie , or Rico of the Monkeys as he was called . He lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred or so exotic birds , a few turtles , dogs , dozens of cats , and the odd broken seagull or two which he 'd nurse back to health . To many , Rico himself was an odd species , but to me he was only a rare one . <p> We spent most of the day repairing some of the outdoor cages and feeding the animals , which is how we usually passed our time together-sharing more work than words . Toward dusk we went indoors . I 'd always thought of Rico as a grandfather , yet that day in a moment of handing me a hammer I realized he was closer to my father 's age and that I , in effect , could be his son . Could follow in his footsteps-a thought that more than once had crossed my mind in the past . A life of full time hermitage and retreat from the pains and progress of man . <p> Toward dusk we went indoors to feed ourselves . Meals with Rico were always simple-cooked whole potatoes or rice , handfuls of clementines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crates that fed his animals . Rico ate with fingers half bent , like the monkeys themselves . A 27-inch television sat beside the table , which Rico kept constantly playing for a voice . Usually we 'd sit together and watch , now and then Rico talking back to the screen , cursing at all the politicians , the commercials , the Pope . That evening though , I got a hold of the remote control and found the mute switch . <p> " Rico , " I said , " Have you ever been afraid ? " He looked at me , swallowed some fruit , and after a moment said , " No . . . Not much . Not even during the war when they were bombing . " <p> I knew his stories of the war-of Tunisia and of the Americans ' mistaken bombing of Treviso nearby , the sky overhead black with planes . I also knew he had once worked side by side with Alessandro 's father at the port . With Alessandro . <p> " But death ? What about death ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war here . The first one to have to carry them was always me . " <p> " But now I mean , do you think of death ? " <p> " No . I 'm not ready . " <p> He said this matter of factly , and I had to laugh . <p> " But if I ever do feel something , I say ai . " <p> " Ai ? " <p> " Yes . Ai ! And it goes away . " <p> On the television , soccer players ran across a field . Some were dressed in red , some in yellow . <p> " What do you think happens after our death ? " <p> " Ah , the big question , " said Rico . " If you ask me , when you lose your senses you no longer exist . Heaven , hell ? What the priests tell you ? I do n't believe it , not in the least what they say . " <p> He reached for another clementine and broke its skin . <p> " However , I 'm convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worms born . Little worms , without eyes or legs . Who knows what kind of life they lead , underground the way they are . You see them , you do n't see them . There are machines that can sense such things , but I do n't know . . . but I am certain that if someone could follow such a worm that one day a bird would come and eat it and then shit you back down to the ground to fertilize the trees . Or else carry you back to their nest and feed their young so that one day you can fly . Either way , you join all the rest . The animals , the trees , the air , the water . . . this is another thought , more than death . " <p> One night while my father lay in a coma-and as it turned out , his last night-I took photographs of him . Something about the act seemed obscene to me even as I was doing it , yet I continued ; literally leaned over his bed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the images . Pulled back the covers on the bed . It was a roll of slide film I shot , which about a week after the funeral I received in the mail in a small , square box . I never opened it , yet it , too , sits in some old shoebox alongside my childhood photographs . In some basement . <p> As a youngster , I remember how each year on the first day back to school the teacher would scratch the words " what i did on my summer vacation " onto the blackboard , then promptly hand out construction paper . There would always be colorful pictures drawn , filled with cars and swimming pools , watermelons , flowers . Yet as we grew older , all the crayons and magic markers turned into No. 2 pencils or ballpoints , into penmanship , essays . <p> Thinking about all the novels and novellas set in Venice , what I envision above all else is a theme of morbidity . Stories plagued by the macabre or decadence or , at the very least , intrigue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blacks , greys . Maybe a deep red here or there . A midnight blue . Meanwhile , the painters of Venice , who must carry the same doubts and longings as writers , ca n't deny themselves a wider palette . Their garret studios howsoever remote , must let in light and its prism of colors . They can not enclose themselves nor their work within . At worst , there is chiaroscuro . <p> For years , in one form or another , I have been writing about my father , or by extension , my brother . About all that went unspoken , unbridged . All that we 've carried . All that remained in the dark . To some extent all writing is about the past . All writing , a shrine . Painters too record , and yet . . I would never think of trying to paint that grey stairwell . Never . I should have been a painter . <p> 10 Agosto . Aless seemed a little better today . Moments of clarity . Presence . Noticed how his long-term memory seems more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to share , more past than present . As for the future ? Well , less than two days till I leave . Strange , now wishing there was more time . We 're still only halfway through The Little Prince . <p> 11 Agosto . He was sleeping when I visited this morning , so I just sat beside the bed . Started sketching his body-the lost tone , the dead right arm the wheelchair and the room . . . his old schoolbooks on the shelf wooden pull toys , boxes of medicine on the nighttable . . . " What is essential is invisible to the eye , " the little prince repeated , so that he would be sure to remember <p> Later in the kitchen , stood beside his mother at the window , handing her clothespins . One by one she attached the wet sheets and bedclothes then pulled on the pulley to release them to the wind . Outside shone ceramic rooftops and steeples . I wondered if she knew Alessandro wanted to be cremated and have his ashes spread into the lagoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took a ferry out past the Lido where the string of long littorals protecting the Venetian lagoon gradually thinned , and the shoreline became a great jetty of stone boulders buttressing three tiny fishing villages from the sea . Among these random rocks rested huge trunks of driftwood , long beached and bleached by the waves . And old wooden crates and cork buoys , strands of fishing nets , small bottles , vials , shells . Things left behind , forgotten . I fell asleep on one of those rocks and when I awoke the sun had moved and the tide receded . Hours had passed me by , the day already dimming . The near waves were the color of bruises , yet out in the distance floated a boat . Its sails a shimmer of white , appearing and disappearing among the crests and troughs . So remote . Intangible . <p> Still , it struck me that despite the distance there was a bridge between the boat and my eye . I could see it and it could see me , or if not me specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's prow may yearn for the open waves its stern must watch the shore recede . And even if it were to drift out beyond sight , I still knew it was there just as the boat would still be connected to the shoreline , for there is no being at sea without a shore . There is no amputation then . Memory , not only a shipwreck , but a harbor to return to again and again . A shoebox . A photograph . A face frozen in time . A crippled heart waiting to beat anew . There is no loss without gain , I thought . There is no loss in truth , only gain . <p> I sat on the shore 's edge and watched the distant boat among the waves . Both its comings and its goings were a beautiful thing , and one no less natural than the other . No less natural than night and day . I gathered my belongings and walked toward one of the villages , where the streets were quiet and the fishing boats gently rocked in their moorings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age-old trick of light . I 'd seen it many times before , the water 's surface glowing both green and rust , a phosphorescent dance of cellophane and eternity . And as I stood there , a memory washed up to shore , a day Alessandro had once taken me out rowing among the canals . He 'd taught me some of the varied oar strokes and where and when to shift my weight , when and where to stop for vino . Taught me how within a maze I need n't feel lost so much as liquid-flowing forth , seeking my own level , trusting the tides to lead me where they will . <p> Soon the evening sky offered up its constellations , its black holes , its worm holes . Night fell and in the far distance tiny lights were turning on one by one all over Venice . The jewel of the Adriatic igniting her palaces and bell towers , her stone white bridges . Her Bridge of Sighs . And standing there , I swear I felt something rise up out of my chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took a step toward the edge of the water . <p> The following morning I packed my bags for the train station and spent my last half hour in Venice at Alessandro 's bedside . He was more himself , more conscious than at any other time during my visit . This was good , yet had its disadvantages as well . He was more aware of his condition and its weight . Aware that I was there and that I 'd be leaving . <p> He asked me to help place him in his wheelchair so I could see him sitting upright . Carefully I slid him off the bed , yet stepping back noticed he was wincing . <p> " What 's wrong ? " I asked . <p> He struggled to swallow , clutched at the arm of the wheelchair . I could see his shoulders quivering against the pain . When the shaking finally subsided , he raised his head and whispered , <p> " I 'm so afraid . " <p> I wanted to scream . Scream so fucking loud that time itself would stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wanted to hold him in my arms and somehow explain everything I 'd felt out on the rocky shore . About the sailboat and the tides and the dusk and the stars . I wanted to make my words all add up to that glowing moment at the water 's edge , but when the words came all I managed was , " Yes . I know , Aless . I am , too . " <p> I knelt down before the wheelchair and took his hands in mine , first the good one and then the bad . On his fingers were little tattoos-a small round dot in the crevice between one thumb and forefinger , two on a pinkie , six in all . I knew each mark represented a specific old friend , each of whom shared a similar mark on their own hands . For the last year or so I 'd been wanting to ask him if we could do the same , but was always too afraid . I rubbed the little marks on his fingers . <p> " You know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " For us . " <p> Aless looked toward me , though his eyes could not see . <p> " Here , " I said , and pressed three of his fingers against the place on my wrist where I 'd mapped out the space . " Three dots right here . What do you think ? " <p> Alessandro 's fingers slid from my wrist to my palm and pressed of their own will . <p> " You do n't need to do this , " he said , " mark yourself for me . " <p> " No , but I want to . " <p> I wished I could explain my reasons . How they were n't to make a shrine to the past anymore , but to celebrate it . Celebrate what was still in that room between us . <p> " I want to , " I repeated , " I will , when I get back to the States . " <p> Aless pulled back his good hand and lay it in his lap . <p> " You have to go now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several pigeons reeled in flight . I heard others steadily cooing from the near rooftops . <p> " Yes . The train 's leaving soon . " <p> In my mind I could see it already waiting at the station . Could see it pulling away , like that tiny white boat out in the waves . I looked at Alessandro , a mere foot or two between us . I lunged forward and embraced him . <p> I could feel the breathing in his chest . His words , pushing out . <p> " Thank you , " he said , " for coming . " <p> Thank me , I thought , thank me ? Then I started to shake . <p> " You have to go now , " he said . " Please , go . " <p> I pulled away and reached for my bags . <p> " Why three , " he asked . " Three dots ? " <p> " One for you . One for me . And one for what is and will always be between us . " <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added , " Be careful of the needle . " <p> Joseph Brodsky has written that to leave Venice always feels as if you are leaving it forever : " For leaving is a banishment of the eye . . . And to the eye , for purely optical reasons , departure is not the body leaving the city but the city abandoning the pupil . . . A tear is the anticipation of the eye 's future . " <p> I stumbled down that grey staircase and out into the twisting calle . Stumbled toward the train station . <p>
