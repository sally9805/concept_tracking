The rapid political and economic unification of the two Germanys is paying an unexpected dividend : a combined attack on terrorism . After pooling information from West Germany and the impounded files of the now defunct East German secret police , the Stasi , East German authorities this month arrested seven people believed to be members of West Germany 's notorious Red Army Faction , whose bloody campaign claimed more than 20 lives between 1970 and 1978 . <P> The most notable arrest came on June 6 , when police seized Susanne Albrecht , 39 , one of some two dozen R.A.F. members on West Germany 's most wanted list . Albrecht , who is married to an East German scientist , is accused of taking part in the 1977 killings of Jurgen Ponto , chairman of the Dresdner Bank , and industrialist Hanns-Martin Schleyer . East German Interior Minister Peter- Michael Diestel said the arrests provided evidence of a " devilish connection " between the R.A.F. and the Stasi  --  a connection that is now certain to be further investigated .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
