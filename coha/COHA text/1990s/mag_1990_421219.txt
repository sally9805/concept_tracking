Hispanics are the cutting edge of the international fashion industry , weaving their unique cultural heritate into imaginative designs . <p> THE FASHION HISTORIAN Georgina O'Hara states her passionate belief that people should take fashion more seriously than they do . For her , the study of fashion can be at once , " a history lesson , a geography lesson , an economics lesson and a mathematics lesson . " She also believes that fashion is a window to a culture and a mirror of the moment . <p> Latin America , a region of snowcapped mountains and lush tropical forests , of painters Fernando Botero and Rufino Tamayo , of writers Isabel Allende and Octavio Paz , and of scientists Franklin Chang Diaz and Cesar Milstein , has also contributed first-rate fashion designers to the world . Among the most outstanding are Dominican Oscar de la Renta , Venezuelan Carolina Herrera , Cubans Luis Estevez and Adolfo , and Spanish-born Fernando Pena . Although all of them have reached exalted status in the pantheon of international fashion , they are all the products of a Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In September , 1990 , at what has been billed by the local press " the most anticipated fashion show of the season , " and " a paean to the richness and cultural diversity that is Latin America , " the sixth annual Hispanic Designers Fashion Show presented the newest collections . This year 's event was a showcase of contrasts  --  elegant and fanciful , sober and bubbly , dark and light , a study in chiaroscuro . The audience basked in a kaleidoscope of colors and textures , shapes and sounds that catapulted Latin America to center stage . <p> " We are blessed with a glamorous , exotic culture , " said the show 's director , Penny Harrison . " We are not one , but several peoples . We stand for excitement , romance , passion , and pride . These values are never more illustriously reflected than in the field of fashion . Oscar de la Renta , Adolfo , Carolina Herrera and Paloma Picasso , to name a few , bring to fashion not only their personal signatures , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment a woman is born in Latin America , she is bejeweled and put on display . Whether in Colombia or Costa Rica , Argentina or Panama , a girl 's ears are pierced as soon as her umbilical cord is cut . She must , from the moment of birth  --  and regardless of her social status  --  look well-groomed , " bien arreglada . " <p> " You just do it , " says Carolina Hererra refering to this accepted social code . " It becomes second nature ; you 're taught that this is a way of showing respect for others and yourself . Being well-groomed is your contribution to society and I think Latin American women are very good at this . " <p> Oscar de la Renta was the only son in a family of seven children whose mother fastidiously groomed all her children . He married the late French socialite Francoise de Langlade who grew up under the same strict aesthetic rules . Until her death in 1983 , Francoise de la Renta , reigned as one of New York 's premiere hostesses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview with the New York Times , Francoise de la Renta explained how her mother had instilled in her a drive for refinement and beauty . " Always be impeccable . " <p> The interest in fashion is not limited to women , however . As noted by Maruja Baldwin , the famous Costa Rican who was the first Latin American woman to model for Coco Chanel in Paris , " Latin men are equally rigorous with their grooming , no question about it . They are just as conscious of their appearance . " " Dressing is , for Latin men and women , a very serious business , " notes Cuban-born Marilu Menendez , an international public relations consultant for a number of design firms . " Latins dress to be seen . It is an attitude that crosses class lines otherwise rigidly kept ; an attitude that has even inspired such classical novels as El Lazarillo de Tormes , by the Spanish writer Diego Hurtado de Mendoza . <p> New York , the fashion heart of the United States , is where almost all of the new Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melting pot , " the rhythm and tone of all that is foreign is accepted and assimilated . The same diversity  --  the colors of an entire continent  --  is reflected on every street corner . <p> There is a similarity between the dynamics of the streets of New York and the dynamics of a Latin American plaza . Menendez suggests that they both capture a fascination with fashion , the appreciation for that which is done merely for effect , its unashamed desire to squander it all . They are the perfect setting for flaunting , for strutting , for impressing . What other city could provide a better audience for our panache , our assertion of style and self ? <p> " In New York , " remarked the U.S. novelist Louis S. Auchincloss , " the snobbishness of birth is totally out . There is snobbishness about money and power and snobbishness about appearance  --  how you look and what you wear . It 's an immensely visual culture ... In the old New York , people did n't really care what you looked like . Now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a lacquered picturesque society . It does make rather extraordinary-looking parties and fashions . " <p> It is in this milieu that many Latin American designers have made their mark . Obsessed with the desire to succeed , to do well in what they all love best , these giants of the fashion world were also fueled by a Herculean stamina , an instinct for trends and unerring taste . They all credit their Hispanic heritage as being the propelling force , regardless of where they were born or where they received their professional training . <p> " Anyone who has lived or visited Latin America knows what an incredibly sensual experience that is , " says Luis Aguilar , a professor of history and cross-cultural studies at Georgetown University . " Any expression of creativity coming from Latin America has to be a product of what I regard as the nicest form of assault on the senses . " Luis Estevez , who was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at this year 's Hispanic Designers Gala , agrees . " My heritage is the source of my talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good or bad  --  my love of life . It is me , I can not think of me without it . " Compatriot Fernando Pena adds , " To me it is very meaningful to be of Spanish ancestry . It has helped me to become who I am and to succeed in this country . " <p> " If you know a little bit about fashion history , " says Carolina Herrera , " you can see that fashion is a repetition . It is simply all in making it look different , the way you put things together and the materials you use , because the ideas have been there forever . For me , my heritage , helps me add that extra dimension , it enriches my designs ; it gives them their uniqueness , their elegance . " Adolfo agrees with Herrera , " Everything in fashion has been done before . I like to make predictable clothes . I want women to feel they are seeing an old friend , both the clothes and me . " <p> The cultural richness of their backgrounds undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pena to develop the most crucial ingredient for any couturier : an uncanny familiarity with their clientele ; an ability to play to their vanity . <p> In an issue featuring the Hispanic contribution to the arts , Time magazine noted that " designers of all cultural extractions are working to capture the best elements of Latin American and Spanish design . " One such designer is Ofelia Montejano , a Mexican living in Los Angeles whose use of vibrant jewel colors  --  ruby , emerald , deep purples  --  reflects her heritage . " When I was a little girl in Michoacan , Mexico , I admired the way even the poorest people made use of color , " say Montejano . " They take raw color and use it in a very honest , creative way . " <p> Another talented newcomer is Estevan Ramos , also of Mexico . Winner of the Rising Star Award at this year 's Gala , Ramos wowed the crowd with a Spanish tango collection of ruffled tops and sweeping skirts in periwinkle , mint and peach . " That 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colors of my background . " <p> Unlike their classically oriented predecessors , young Hispanic designers have been tremendously influenced by the mass media . Their fashions are eclectic and daring . Vivid colors , geometric lines and metallic or glittery fabrics predominate . These creations are either unisex or utterly feminine , reflecting the changing status of women in today 's society . <p> In a world that is growing smaller through advanced technology and communications , the contributions of this younger generation of designers will surely span the continents . If fashion is a lesson in history and geography , as Georgina O'Hara states , then Hispanic designers have taught the world well . Shaped by their own cultural heritage , these fashion architects are in turn helping to shape the patterns of the future . <p> OSCAR DE LA RENTA , 58 , one of the top creative designers in contemporary fashion , was born in Santo Domingo . Determined to become an abstract painter , he went to Madrid as an adolescent to attend the Academia de San Fernando . By his second year there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown for the debutante daughter of the U.S. ambassador to Spain which was featured on the cover of Life magazine . Shortly after , Cristobal Balenciaga , the mastermind of 20th century fashion , asked de la Renta to join the staff of AESA , the Balenciaga couture house in Madrid . <p> After working for Antonio de Castillo at the house of Lanvin-Castillo in Paris , de la Renta moved to the Jane Derby design company in New York and eventually took over the business . In 1967 , he won the Coty American Fashion Critics Award for his " Gypsy " collection which was cited as a pacesetter for the ethnic fashion period that eventually swept the world . After being recognized for 25 years of excellence at the recent Hispanic Fashion Show , he told reporters " I am most happy when I am at my studio with my designs , but I always panic ; fear makes me work well , harder . " <p> Oscar de la Renta , who is the father of an orphan , has established numberous welfare programs and schools in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a prominent Cuban diplomat . Educated in Nova Scotia and Spain , he showed an interest and talent in the design field at an early age . He began his fashion career in Madrid in the 1940s . <p> From Spain he went to Havana and opened a design atelier and factory .

Among his many honors , Pena was the recipient of the MODA award in 1989 . <p> CAROLINA HERRERA is a name synonymous with elegance , purity of lines , quality material , sophistication and a sense of personal style . Herrera , born in Caracas , Venezuela , had no formal artistic training . At age 13 , on a trip to Paris with her grandmother , she met Cristobal Balenciaga ( de la Renta 's mentor ) . <p> Inspired by what she saw , the young Venezuelan presented a small fashion show in Caracas . It was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereafter , she began her almost monthly trips to different U.S. cities and in 1981 she launched her career at New York 's exclusive Metropolitan Club . Herrera was the first South American fashion leader to make headlines as far away as Tokyo . <p> Recipient of the 1987 Hispanic Designers MODA Award , Herrera is the driving force of her New York-based business that features the Bridal Couture Collection . She designed all of the gowns for Caroline Kennedy 's wedding , including the elegant suit worn by Jacqueline Onassis . Other lines include the moderately priced CH , Carolina Herrera Perfumes and in 1990 , Carolina Herrera Collection III , sportswear targeted for a younger audience . <p> PALOMA PICASSO , although born in France , spent part of her early years in Spain and considers herself an Hispanic designer . Picasso specializes in jewelry , designing for the famous house of Tiffany . Earrings fashioned with the " XX " design have become her trademark . She also designs fine china , crystal and tiles for Villeroy &; Boch and perfumes and cosmetics for Cosmair .
