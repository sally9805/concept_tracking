THE COMMITTEE TO SAVE THE WORLD <P> " The world economy is so rickety that only a cell-phone tag team of financial sorcerers can fend off massive financial meltdown . " CRAIG BESINQUE New Denver , B.C. <P> There is nothing more disturbing than reading an article devoted to the trio of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan , Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Deputy Treasury Secretary Larry Summers BUSINESS , Feb. 15 . These men hypocritically preach the merits of free markets and the evils of crony capitalism , yet have done more to subvert the free market than any other American economic navigators to date . They are anything but saviors of the world . By undermining the free markets on behalf of Wall Street special interests , they have destroyed the once level playing field and removed the essential element of risk necessary to keep markets rational . DAVID COHEN Los Angeles <P> Having worked with the Fed 's Paul Volker and Treasury 's Don Regan in the mid-1980s , I am in a unique position to recognize the extraordinary job that your Committee to Save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've ever had . But recognition must also be given to the many professional career people at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve , without whose expertise and tireless efforts the current situation might not have been achieved . <P> Now the challenge is to demonstrate to the world that the loss of sovereignty by governments to capital markets is a new paradigm that will reward governments with good policies and punish those with bad ones . TIM MCNAMAR , DEPUTY SECRETARY U.S. Treasury Department , 1981-85 New York City <P> Just who is being saved by the dynamic trio 's efforts ? Unless we cancel the debts of the poorest nations so that resources can be invested in health and education , we are simply bailing water without fixing the leak . STEPHEN VALK Atlanta <P> Greenspan , Rubin and Summers would have been an overwhelmingly better choice for TIME 's Men of the Year than Bill Clinton and Kenneth Starr . FRANK HAINZE Oakland , Calif . <P> Your committee to save the world should be in the Hall of Shame , not in a pantheon of financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He starved the world of dollar liquidity from November 1996 onward , as he watched the price of gold fall from $383 to $285 . Ignoring this sure sign of monetary deflation , Greenspan caused a crisis in every country that relies on commodity exports to earn a living . JUDE T. WANNISKI , PRESIDENT Polyconomics Inc . Morristown , N.J. <P> I missed seeing any reference to Congress 's role in taking steps that have helped stimulate economic growth . If not for the perseverance of some key Republicans , there would be no thought at all in the White House of making economic policy more market oriented . Our economy will stay on its rising trajectory despite Clinton , Greenspan , Rubin and Summers , not because of them . KEVIN MCLAUGHLIN Mission Viejo , Calif . <P> Greenspan  --  by lowering U.S. interest rates and by giving his blessing to the rescue of Long-Term Capital Management and to IMF bailouts around the world  --  has shown that altruism , when yoked to rigorous analysis , can work .
