THE CHARGES CAME QUICKLY AND HARD : MURder . Manslaughter . And the message was clear : Detroit is not Los Angeles . Criminal charges have been brought against four Detroit police officers in the killing of black motorist Malice Green , allegedly beaten to death by police earlier this month . Two white officers , Larry Nevers and Walter Budzyn , will be tried on second-degree-murder charges and could get life in prison if convicted . Freddie Douglas , a black cop , stands accused of involuntary manslaughter , which carries a maximum 15-year sentence , and willful neglect of duty , punishable by as much as a year . Officer Robert Lessnau , who is white , faces a term of as much as 10 years if found guilty of assault . Defense lawyers have come out swinging , playing up an autopsy report that shows Green had traces of alcohol and cocaine in his body . The next hearing is Dec. 14.
