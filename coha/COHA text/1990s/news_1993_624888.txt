<p> TWO extraordinary exhibitions mark a high point in " " Introductions " history . The annual summer shows , presented by the Houston Art Dealers Association member galleries , always have had ups and downs . But this year , the works of photographer Bill Thomas and painter Michael Charles surpass even high expectations . <p> Each artist addresses important issues about life and art . <p> Charles , 26 , battles racial stereotypes head on . His unwincing , unapologetic paintings/posters promote products with the brand name of Forever Free . <p> Thomas , 45 , breaks open one of society 's taboos - suicide - by illustrating it with humor and honesty in startling black-and-white photographs . <p> Charles ' images of " " Sambos " address a part of history he wants African-Americans to remember . The works can seem brutal . <p> Charles reinvents racist stereotypes , as indictments of the white society that invented them and the African-Americans who bought into them . A grinning , leering mouth ; a black girl with blue eyes and blond hair ; an evil-looking black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign " " Ideal " - all imply much more than the eye sees . <p> Earlier work , such as the fragile paintings Charles exhibited in the watershed " " Fresh Visions/New Voices " at the Glassell School last year , addressed the same issues in subtle , painterly ways . <p> This new series is posterlike paintings on paper , dog-eared as if they 'd been posted days ago , bursting with exaggerated , graphic images of stereotypes - the dope dealer , the lazy oaf who drinks on the corner all day . Still , beneath the seemingly crude , flat surfaces , they are thoughtful and multilayered , like the powerful art of the 1960s Chicano movement . <p> The irony begins with the name : Forever Free products . " " You ca n't buy freedom . Freedom is an idea , " the artist says . <p> Street jargon , hanging out , labeling and stereotyping - they take ironic twists in these careful compositions . Charles ' dueling jesters - one with white face , the other with black - represent a choice offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can be like that : a black man who is white , or a black man who is black . <p> That is not the choice at all , " " but our children have bought this image , " Charles says . " " They see this picture of a figure painted black and dressed as a court jester , and identify him as a black man . He is not a black man , he is an image . But that 's what ( the images ) teach our children . " <p> He has filled the gallery space with abused , rickety school chairs to underline his didactic intent . <p> Charles says that the work has placed him in a difficult situation within his community . He uses racial stereotypes to question racial stereotypes - and has been taken to task by some who think he is selling out and promoting what he is fighting against . <p> But if art is to be a healing force , it must be truthful . <p> Truth can cause pain . Charles is smart and talented , dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way toward mending the cultural and psychological rifts that he so skillfully renders . <p> Michael Ray Charles : Forever Free . <p> Where : Moody Gallery , 2815 Colquitt , 526-9911 . <p> When : 10 a.m. - 5:30 p.m . Tuesdays-Saturdays , through Aug. 7 . <p> Suicide , that most final action of life , takes wondrously inventive turns in Bill Thomas ' images . <p> The photographer , a recent graduate of the University of Houston , sets himself up in elaborate tableaux for the camera . <p> His meticulous attention to detail and hyper-realist scenarios compel us to believe him and what he proposes to do . <p> Yet his methods are so outrageous and complicated that , instead of recoiling , the viewer chuckles . If , on one hand , we recognize the real means of suicide , we also recognize that in Thomas ' deadly serious absurdities , Wile E.Coyote never dies . <p> In one picture , Thomas ' chosen means of death is decapitation . <p> So he buries himself in a field up to his neck , his head camouflaged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To die by drowning , he anchors himself in the bottom of a huge , empty swimming pool , with concrete blocks around his ankles and a snorkel on his face . Two thin streams of water are visible behind him . <p> Then things get complicated . He surrounds himself with automated baseball pitching machines that , once activated , undoubtedly will puree his skull . Or , in a homey setting , he rigs a shotgun so that his golden retriever will pull the trigger when he jumps for the dog treat temptingly suspended as bait . <p> His devices are unique , imaginative , and just waiting to go off : The dog will jump , the ice will melt , and the iron will burn through the rope . Often , death is engineered to take a long time . Whether that 's a self-imposed trial of patience or an escape hatch , should he change his mind , is never clear . <p> In some pictures the possibility of aborting the death is clear : He could bend forward and duck the bullet . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent . Escaping death would be a betrayal , the ultimate act of self- sabotage . <p> So the audience , his witnesses , must confront its own feelings and thoughts about suicide . <p> The series , Thomas says in a gallery statement , " " attempts to deal with this taboo , social-psychological content in an ironic way , of looking at suicide from both serious and humorous perspectives . " <p> He was a kid on the playground of Poe Elementary School the day in 1959 when a " " madman killed himself and eight others by detonating a very powerful bomb on the school grounds . No consideration was ever given for the treatment of our trauma . " <p> The " " conspiracy of denial , " as Thomas phrases it , condemned the witnesses to remember and relive the scene forever . <p> He says he is not in the least bit suicidal . He always has contingency plans . In the death-by-roaring-train photo , for example , he explains that he could have ducked below the trestle if a real machine had come roaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment , of course , but I would be safe . " <p> His most unnerving experience while making the series came when he set up the hanging . He suspended a noose from the beam of a freeway underpass , then stood on one end of a crude seesaw beneath it . His weight was balanced by a block of ice at the opposite end - keeping him safely aloft , for the time being . <p> During all that preparation , until he actually shot the picture , Thomas said not a single passerby stopped - not to offer help , try to stop him or ask why . <p> " " I never even could make eye contact , " Thomas said . <p> Thomas , who graduated from the University of Texas-Austin with a degree in psychology , received his master of fine arts degree this year from the University of Houston and is the recipient of a 1993 Houston Center for Photography fellowship . <p> Suicide : Photographs by Bill Thomas . <p> Where : Benteler-Morgan Galleries , 4100 Montrose , 522-8228 . <p> When : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p.m . Saturdays , through July 31 . <p> TYPE : Art Review
