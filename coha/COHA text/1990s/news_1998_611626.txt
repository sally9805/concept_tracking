<p> Like a massive earthquake followed by endless aftershocks , Mikhail Gorbachev 's decision to allow Jews to leave the Soviet Union en masse nearly a decade ago has reshaped the political , cultural and economic landscape of Israel and continues to redefine the Jewish state . <p> Both in its massive scale  --  nearly a million former Soviet immigrants will have arrived by 2000  --  and its astonishingly high educational and professional quality , the Russian influx is unlike any previous surge of immigration to Israel , which this week celebrates the 50th anniversary of its founding . It is as if the United States had suddenly absorbed the entire population of England , with Scotland 's added for good measure . <p> Even now , immigrants from the Soviet successor states continue to land at Ben-Gurion Airport at a clip of more than 150 a day , dwarfing all other current immigrant groups to Israel and altering neighborhoods , offices and the country 's political calculus . <p> The " Russians , " a generic term encompassing immigrants from all 15 former Soviet republics , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threat to jobs , wages and prosperity , they have in fact helped reinvigorate the Israeli economy . <p> For immigrants who arrived in the early 1990s , the unemployment rate , about 7 percent , is below that of other Israelis . Most own their own apartments . Half own cars . The once-gaping disparity in earnings is closing as Russians steadily move up the corporate ladder . <p> " If you look at the U.S. , France , Germany or Canada , their immigrants are always less skilled than the native population , " said Rachel Friedberg , an economist at Brown University in Rhode Island . <p> " But the Russians are actually more skilled than native Israelis  --  more engineers , more musicians , more physicians , " Friedberg said . " Over time they 've done incredibly well . " <p> From its founding in 1948 , Israel has been a country of immigrants , and it remains emphatically so today . Half the exceptionally young population of 5.9 million was born elsewhere . Nearly all the cabinet ministers in Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broad spectrum of the Jewish diaspora  --  Russians , Ukrainians , Moroccans , Yemenites , Spaniards , Tunisians , Austrians , Hungarians , Iranians , Romanians and Kurds . <p> As in the United States , immigration is central to Israel 's self-image and to its drive and ambition . It is also a wellspring of personal heartache , social upheaval and political tension . <p> The gauzy myth of an Israeli melting pot , nurtured for decades by Jews who flocked to the new country seeking social harmony in a land of their own , has yielded to a harsh new reality : a culture at once richer and more diverse , but also far more balkanized than its founders ever imagined . <p> Just look south of Tel Aviv , to the town of Bnei Ayish , where a construction manager from Moscow who barely knew what a bar mitzvah was a decade ago is now on the verge of becoming mayor . <p> Grigory Lifshits arrived in Israel in 1992 and moved to Bnei Ayish , which consisted of a few hundred families , most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The families lived in bungalows , worked in the groves and fields outside town , kept kosher kitchens , sent their kids to a religious school and attended synagogue regularly . <p> Lifshits , now in his late forties , represented a new breed of immigrant for Bnei Ayish  --  urban , professional , college-educated and secular . <p> " Few of us knew the first thing about Judaism in Russia , " said Lifshits , who is one of just a handful of Russians in Bnei Ayish who wears a religious skullcap . <p> The Russian settlers in Bnei Ayish soon became a flood , and the Yemenites who had been there for years began talking about a " Russian takeover . " <p> What had been a settlement of 1,500 people swelled to a town of 7,000 . Three-story apartment blocs  --  referred to by the Yemenites as " high-rises "  --  sprouted to house the newcomers . The apartment blocs were in the southwest of town ; the Yemenites ' bungalows were in the northeast . <p> In their part of town , the Russians opened delicatessens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street  --  selling ham and bacon . Few attended synagogue ; almost none kept kosher . They built secular schools for their children . They opened a new community center where the lingua franca was Russian and the sport of choice volleyball . <p> Swamped by the newcomers , the Yemenites despaired . Nearly two-thirds of the town is now Russian . In local elections this November , the Russians will easily capture a majority of the town council seats . Lifshits , once a loyal Communist Party member in Moscow , is the odds-on favorite to become the new mayor . <p> " There are even rumors that they want to build an Orthodox church , " said Yishiye Yidye , the Yemenite deputy mayor who has watched the town 's transformation with dismay . " This would be the worst thing that could possibly happen . " <p> Lifshits scoffed at the idea of an Orthodox church but acknowledged that cohabitation has been strained . " The tension has n't reached the point of violence , " he said . " But there is tension . " <p> Redefining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glossed over when Arab enemies loomed larger , have been brought home to Israelis by the Russians with all the subtlety of a poke in the eye . The Russians now comprise nearly a fifth of the nation 's population . Many are ignorant of Judaism , and at least a quarter of them are not even regarded as Jewish , including the husbands , wives and children of those who are . <p> Yet the Russians in Israel are so numerous , and their sense of culture so strong , that few feel ostracized . <p> " Why should we be integrated ? " said Eduard Kuznetsov , a former Soviet dissident and political prisoner who is now chief editor of Vesti , Israel 's largest Russian-language newspaper . " Why should n't we fight and protest to advance our rights ? If you 're big enough you can fight to keep your own culture . <p> " Is there tension in Israeli society ? So what ? Tension is part of life . " <p> Said Sergei Michael , a Russian immigrant and activist in Israel 's Labor Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies and ethnic groups actually opposed to each other . There 's no mosaic because the pieces do n't fit . " <p> It is dawning on Israelis that Russians not only are making good much more quickly than was forecast , they also are redefining Israel and what it means to be an Israeli . <p> Take the case of Michael Kagan , who went to work in Israel for a small high-tech company called Intel Corp . in 1983 . A young engineer from Leningrad , Kagan had arrived in Israel during a briefer exodus of Soviet Jews in the 1970s . He had n't the slightest expectation of the wave that followed . <p> Intel 's development center in Haifa had just 40 employees , and Kagan was the only one from the Soviet Union . The company 's second Russian immigrant was n't hired until five years later . <p> Then came the deluge  --  a shock wave of Jewish emigres from the disintegrating Soviet empire starting in late 1989 that nearly tripled the number of engineers in Israel and helped fuel a high-tech boom that persists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex in Haifa  --  the firm 's only development center outside the United States  --  has 800 workers . Of those , about 150 are Russians . Kagan , now chief of the microprocessor design department , makes recruiting trips to Moscow to help meet a soaring demand for engineers that Israel 's universities can not satisfy . <p> " There 's a huge need right now in Israel for high-tech engineers , " said Kagan . " Immigration from Russia has been one of the key factors enabling this growth . " <p> One Israeli commentator , writing last week in the daily newspaper Ha'aretz , likened the immigrants ' arrival to a $ 10 billion aid program from the former Soviet states . Economists regard the Russian immigration as an infusion of highly trained human capital that Israel itself could never have generated so quickly . <p> The Russian impact has been felt everywhere , from the northern town of Metulla , where Moroccan kids play ice hockey under the tutelage of Russian coaches , to the southern desert city of Beersheba , which says it is home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one of them Russian-born . <p> In the coastal town of Ashdod , Russians have started an international summer jazz festival , now entering its fifth season . Nearby , in the Barzilai regional hospital in Ashqelon , a majority of the staff physicians are Russian , including the chiefs of the surgery and oncology departments . In practically every corner of Israel , native-born Israeli music teachers have been squeezed out of business by a deluge of job-hungry Russian violinists and pianists willing to work for less . <p> " I have a notebook full of Russians  --  60 names  --  who are qualified music teachers in search of work , " said Hanita Zvevner , director of the music conservatory in Ashdod . " There are n't enough students for them all . " <p> A Political Force As the Russian immigration made itself felt , the expectations that attended their arrival ran full force into very different realities . Some Israeli women 's groups had hoped the new immigrants would swell their ranks and add muscle to the abortion-rights movement in Israel . But Russian women have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendants of Europeans , saw the Russians as natural allies who would help neutralize the growing influence of the Sephardim , immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East . But in the 1996 elections the Russians , in the form of a newly formed party called Yisrael B'aliyah ( Movement for Israel and Immigration ) , joined forces with the Sephardim and helped elect Netanyahu , a conservative prime minister . <p> Peace activists assumed the Russian Jews , once an oppressed minority themselves in the Soviet Union , would identify with the Palestinians and press for a negotiated settlement . Few of the new arrivals appear to feel sympathy for their Arab neighbors , or for the idea of trading West Bank land for peace with the Palestinians . <p> " There is a Soviet mentality that is still alive  --  paternalism . . . and territorial chauvinism , " said Roman Bronfman , a political scientist who arrived from Ukraine in 1980 . A member of Yisrael B'aliyah , he is a moderate member of the Israeli parliament . " Although the Soviet structure broke down , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best-known Russian immigrant , former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky , has surprised many Israelis . Many see him as a hero for his courage in defying his Soviet jailers and persecutors . For the 1996 elections he helped found Yisrael B'aliyah , which stunned analysts by winning seven seats in parliament . <p> Sharansky 's prize was a cabinet seat as minister of trade and industry . Perhaps inevitably , his transition to government has come at a price . Beleaguered by the rough-and-tumble of Israeli politics and by deep splits in his own party , Sharansky is losing some of his moral aura and starting to be seen as another in the country 's clamorous ranks of right-wing politicians . <p> Sharansky is disturbed no more by the suggestion that he has become a politician than by the notion that Israel is changing . <p> " There is a new type of integration , a new type of Zionism  --  not a melting pot where all these cultures have to disappear , " he said . " There is no such thing as a new type of Jew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we want their tradition and their mentality and their knowledge and their experiences . . . . The big challenge for the state of Israel is how to become the state of all the Jews , where all the Jews feel that they are part of it , when people who are coming after thousands years of life in diaspora have different concepts of everything including , what it means to be a Jew . " <p> Clash of Cultures That challenge is felt first in the main immigrant reception hall at Ben-Gurion Airport  --  Israel 's Ellis Island . A day in January brought a typical melange : 30 immigrants from Kiev , 25 from Simferopol and 25 from Odessa , all in Ukraine ; 20 from Moldova ; 40 from Minsk , Belarus ; 30 from Moscow ; and 30 from Tblisi , Georgia . Only two flights arrived with immigrants from outside the former Soviet Union  --  Poland and Ethiopia . <p> The immigrants wandered blinking into a spotlessly bright room of blond wood furniture and potted plants . A little girl from Moldova in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs on the wall : camels in the Judean desert , a fisherman on a kibbutz , a hot-air balloon festival . <p> Russian-speaking officials attended briskly to the arrivals , entering their names into computers , handing them identity cards , six months ' free medical insurance and , for retirees , social security checks . Israel has become a relatively rich country , and it treats its immigrants accordingly . <p> There are immediate cash distributions : about $ 540 for a family of four . The same family can also expect benefits amounting to $ 10,000 in the first year . <p> The airport immigration center is run by Boris Hellman , a Soviet emigre . When he arrived with an earlier wave of Soviet immigrants in 1973 , he received about $ 40 . " Now is a much better time to come , " he said . <p> Israelis , particularly North Africans who arrived in much more difficult circumstances in the 1950s , tend to resent the recent Russian emigres . They are regarded as unappreciative , arrogant and only vaguely committed to Judaism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree . They see Israeli society as having done them precious few favors . <p> Many complain of discrimination on the job , of receiving lower wages than native Israelis for the same work . Among intellectual emigres from Moscow and St. Petersburg , it is common to sneer at the idea of Israeli culture . <p> Russian teenagers are volunteering for elite fighting units in the army at the same rate as other Israelis . But older emigres , jaded by a lifetime of Soviet patriotic songs and slogans , wince at the idea that they owe Israel their affections . <p> " It 's a part of Russian culture not to be very patriotic ; to be ironic , sarcastic , " said Kuznetsov , the editor . " I 'm not sure we need patriotism here . " <p> On Thursday , Israel will celebrate the 50th anniversary of its founding . This is the first of several articles that will survey the Jewish state , its views of its first half century and its relationship with American Jews . <p> Russians ' Growing Success Annoys Earlier Immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the founders of this sweltering city along the Mediterranean were 22 Moroccan families who were loaded into a truck , dumped near some sand dunes and told : Welcome to your new home . <p> That unceremonious event was in 1956 . In the next few years , so many French-speaking North African Jews had been settled in Ashdod that some Israelis called it " Little Paris . " <p> The city grew fast and in spurts , including after 1979 when Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi was overthrown and thousands of Iranian Jews emigrated . Yet Ashdod maintained its basic complexion  --  Sephardic Jews of modest means from North Africa and the Middle East . <p> Comprising nearly half of Israel 's population , the Sephardim were ( and remain , along with Israeli Arabs ) the have-nots of Israeli society  --  poorer , less educated , less entrepreneurial , less mobile . As such they felt patronized , insulted and ignored . Their resentment grew , focusing on Israel 's long-standing establishment  --  left-leaning Ashkenazi Jews of European descent . <p> Today , Ashdod is booming . Cranes and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newcomers , and the emerging signs of prosperity , are nearly all Russian . They now comprise more than a quarter of Ashdod 's 160,000 residents . <p> " I see the Russians ' impact , and this is what we are crying over , " said Avner Shem-tov , an activist for Shas , a political party whose core constituents are religious Jews from Morocco , such as those who settled Ashdod . " With God 's help , I hope my daughter will not marry one of them . " <p> To many Sephardim the Russians represent the latest in a long string of humiliations . They see the newcomers as pampered complainers who were handed every advantage while whining that it was n't enough . Their own circumstances upon arrival , and the state 's munificence then , were far more limited . <p> Both Shas and the Russians ' own political party , Israel B'aliyah , belong to the governing coalition . But they are odd bedfellows , united more by their distaste for Israel 's Old Guard liberals than by their respective party platforms . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice is formidable , have become the latest Israelis of European descent to scorn the Sephardim . <p>  --  Lee Hockstader <p> Acclaimed Theater Company Bridges a Cultural Divide <p> KIBBUTZ YAGAR , Israel  --  The play had been sold out for weeks , and on the night of the performance extra rows were installed in the back of the 1,250-seat auditorium . The audience settled in and got its first look at an unusual set : a revolving stage , shaped like a bagel , nestled in a wheat field . There was a buzz of excitement before the first actor uttered a line ; everyone sensed this would be a night of special theater . <p> As Israel 's most acclaimed troupe , the Gesher theater company has been playing to packed houses  --  not only at home but on its increasingly frequent tours of Europe and the United States . <p> Gesher , a mostly Russian-speaking company , performs more than 80 percent of its productions in Hebrew , a language few of the actors could speak just a few years ago  --  and which the artistic director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gesher is the Hebrew word for bridge . Nearly from the start , the company realized it would have to span the cultural chasm separating Russian and Israeli theater in order not to be trapped in an exclusively Russian milieu . That meant performing in Hebrew . <p> " I remember all the other theaters in Israel after World War II of immigrants from Hungary , Romania , you name it , and after one or two or three years they just disappeared , " said Ori Levy , 66 , Gesher 's director general . " Gesher understood that if they did n't want to stay in a Russian ghetto , they had to play in Hebrew . " <p> On this night , Gesher was performing " The Village , " by Joshua Sobol , a play set during and immediately after World War II in what was then British-administered Palestine . The play , which received rave reviews a year ago when Gesher performed it in London , was charming , funny and beautifully acted . <p> Gesher , which performed at the Kennedy Center last month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform " The Village " at Lincoln Center in New York . <p> Arye  --  immodest , iconoclastic and engaging  --  is hailed as a wizard by Israeli critics . Arye is determined that Gesher should continue performing at least a portion of its repertoire in Russian , but he knows its future is in Hebrew . <p> " It has to be the Chekhov of Gesher theater , the Babel of Gesher theater , " he said . " I hope this combination will mean something . " <p>  --  Lee Hockstader
