<p> To the Editor : <p> In " Trial Lawyers as S. &; L. Bounty Hunters " ( Op-Ed , June 21 ) , Harvey F. Wachsman states that the Government has done little to follow through on last year 's promise of an " aggressive pursuit " of fraud , mismanagement or negligence by savings and loan association officers , directors and other professionals . <p> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has more than 500 suits pending against directors , officers , accountants , lawyers and other professionals who may have contributed to losses in bank and thrift failures , as well as against those who insure their conduct . Numerous additional suits are being prepared by the F.D.I.C. and the new Resolution Trust Corporation , which the F.D.I.C. manages . <p> The F.D.I.C. 's division of liquidation has a specially trained unit of more than 500 investigators and support personnel who search for clues about the causes of bank and thrift failures in much the way that medical examiners perform autopsies . This unit is handling nearly 1,000 claims and investigations involving bank officers , directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January , the F.D.I.C. has tried cases or entered into settlements involving professionals and their insurers that will result in recovery of approximately $200 million , and our pending cases involve a substantially greater amount . <p> The Resolution Trust Corporation has its own unit of about 300 financial investigators and support personnel under the same marching orders as the F.D.I.C. group - to spot abuses , document them and help prepare the claims or the litigation needed to recover losses . The Resolution Trust Corporation group also contracts for assistance with private accountants , lawyers and other investigators , a program likely to expand . <p> Mr. Wachsman argues that directors and officers liability insurance offers a major source of recovery that " no one seems to have considered . " We have aggressively pursued this avenue in all cases . A majority of failing thrifts have no directors and officers liability insurance whatever , and only a handful have more than $5 million in coverage . Such insurance also normally excludes coverage for people guilty of fraud . In addition , the policies are generally riddled with exclusions intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the validity of these provisions . <p> In addition to attempts to recover losses through civil litigation , our examiners and investigators have made hundreds of criminal referrals to the Department of Justice , and we have fully supported prosecution efforts . Financial crimes are often difficult to detect and require much time and hard work to prosecute successfully , but we are willing to commit the resources to get the job done . <p> For example , through a unit created in our legal division late last year to prosecute bank and thrift fraud and abuse , the F.D.I.C. routinely asks courts to order restitution from parties found guilty of criminal conduct . In its first six months , this unit assisted in obtaining restitution orders of more than $50 million . In one case , a Federal court in Seattle ordered an individual convicted of defrauding a failed thrift to pay the F.D.I.C. $12.8 million in restitution , one of the highest sums ever ordered in a financial-services industry fraud case . <p> Our commitment to pursuit of wrongdoers comes from the top down . President Bush has called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice . The F.D.I.C. chairman , L. William Seidman , has written judges presiding over major criminal fraud cases to ask for substantial prison terms and restitution payments . In one case where Mr. Seidman made a personal appeal , the former chief executive officer of a failed Texas thrift was sentenced in April to 30 years in jail . In another case , a Texas banker got the maximum sentence for his crimes , 12 years behind bars . <p> In all candor , we may not recover all of the amounts that courts are ordering convicted felons to pay us . In many cases , the money has already been spent , and the future earnings of the criminals are unlikely to match what they owe . But we do believe that the threat of a long prison term and the risk of personal financial loss will have a deterrent effect on individuals who may be considering defrauding a federally insured bank or thrift in the future .
