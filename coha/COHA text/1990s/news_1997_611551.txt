<p> For years , Labor Party national election campaigns in Britain were so inept that they prompted many to question whether the party actually wanted to win . This year , the campaign run by party leader Tony Blair is so smooth that nobody wonders any more whether it wants to win  --  only why and to do what . <p> This situation is no accident . It 's the strategy . Sitting on a lead in the polls for five years , the party has chosen to play it safe : no big programs , no sweeping reforms , nothing that would scare anybody away . <p> Britain 's Labor Party has always stood squarely for something : at its height , bold democratic socialism ; at its depth , recalcitrant trade unions . Now , according to pollsters and pundits alike , it stands primarily for its capacity to unseat the Conservatives on May 1 after 18 years out of power . <p> Blair has changed the party that much . Indeed , he anchors his claim to be qualified for office primarily on the achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he asked rhetorically at one of his morning briefings , the weak Prime Minister John Major and his fractured party , " or me , the person who transformed the Labor Party into the strongest , most professional , most disciplined fighting force in British politics ? " <p> Blair , 43 , is , in fact , widely regarded here as one of the most skillful politicians Britain has seen in modern times . As a campaigner , he can do it all . <p> There he is in Edinburgh , on stage , no lectern , no script , a malfunctioning microphone attached to his shirt , leaving him free to range around in a half crouch , sweating , waving his hands , shouting and preaching to a hyped-up crowd about " hope , " about building " a country we can be proud of again . " <p> " It can happen , " he says , his voice rising . " It will happen . " He moves stage center , puts his hands on his hips , closes his eyes , gazes heavenward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And here he is in London 's financial district , all businesslike , speaking to the elite of the country 's corporate world , reassuring them , with conviction , that the bad old days of union bosses taking " beer and sandwiches " with the prime minister are over , that New Labor , as he has renamed his party , is the party of business . <p> He can work a crowd of teenage girls outside a school , touching outstretched fingertips like a British pop idol ; emerge unscathed from the most savage one-on-one television interviews ; and quote social philosophers , theologians and the lyrics to rock-and-roll songs . <p> There is a classless Blair , who writes that he never felt himself " very anchored in a particular setting or class . One of the things really wrong with Britain is that there are still hangovers from the class system that are great brakes on our ability to be a proper mobile , modern society . Sometimes it has taken the form in the Labor Party of inverted snobbery . " <p> Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons learned from Labor defeats in the past  --  ambitious promises that were perceived as requiring tax increases  --  is the inspiration for the party 's thin platform . <p> Clinton won in 1992 , Blair said in an interview with The Washington Post last year , by seizing an outdated party , one that also scared people , shedding controversial policies and interest groups and bringing it up to date with public opinion . Blair has perceived his mission to be the same . <p> Clinton stumbled badly in 1994 , however , because once elected he found he had promised more than he could deliver . Blair is thinking well ahead ; he speaks not merely of winning this election , but the one after that as well . He 's planning for the next 10 years . <p> And so the Labor Party 's manifesto  --  its platform  --  is a model of modesty . The party will deliver a " new Britain , " Blair states in the introduction he wrote personally . But " I want to do it by making a limited set of important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . They are our covenant with you . . . . We have made it our guiding rule not to promise what we can not deliver ; and to deliver what we promise . " <p> When Blair joined the party in 1975 , he was a most un-Laborite Laborite . He did not come from a trade union but from an exclusive school in Edinburgh and Oxford University , where he studied law , sported shoulder-length hair and played in a rock band . <p> He married a fellow lawyer  --  Cherie Booth  --  whom he had met while both were working in the law office of Alexander Irvine , the man who would become his mentor and introduce him to party bigwigs . Booth , rather than being the old-fashioned Labor Party wife , serving beer and chips to little cells of the faithful , was a top-ranking graduate of the London School of Economics and herself a political aspirant who would run unsuccessfully for the House of Commons in 1983 . <p> Booth lost . Blair won , from a constituency called Sedgefield in the northeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst trouncing  --  at the hands of Margaret Thatcher . It left an indelible impression on Blair and a group of younger Labor Party leaders , who came to be known as the party 's modernizers , largely because of their desire to break the lock on the party of warring interest groups and the trade unions . <p> The country had changed , Blair said last year , but the party had n't . While people yearned for strong and disciplined leadership , the Labor Party was still fragmented . It " had lost its way in the ' 60s and the ' 70s . It had come up with particular prescriptions for particular times , like the welfare state , but as times changed , the party could n't . It kept thinking that it had to depend on those institutions . " <p> Adaptation was blocked by die-hard activists , whose own pursuits created an impression in the country that the party " could not deliver things in the national interest . . . . We were considered one of the least successful parties in Europe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youthful , articulate , smart  --  was separated from the pack and elevated within the party early by like-minded leaders , especially Neil Kinnock , who began the " modernization " process . <p> By 1992 , Clinton was running for president , and Blair and his allies paid close attention , for they believed the Democrats in the United States confronted a similar challenge , which Clinton was dealing with effectively , particularly on the issue of law and order . ( Clinton and Blair tacticians still communicate regularly on strategy and tactics . ) <p> Blair was separated from the pack but not yet its obvious leader . That soon would change . <p> In February 1993 , two 10-year-old boys led away a 2-year-old who had gotten lost in a shopping center , beat him mercilessly , and left his body beside a railroad track . The murder of James Bulger was all the more chilling because his abduction had been captured on a security camera , and the videotape was broadcast on television . <p> Political and religious leaders got involved in the national soul searching that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home secretary and responsible for criminal justice issues , gave the speech that seemed to strike the deepest chord . <p> " The news bulletins of the last week have been like hammer blows struck against the sleeping conscience of the country , urging us to wake up and look unflinchingly at what we see , " he said . " A solution to this disintegration does n't simply lie in legislation . It must come from the rediscovery of a sense of direction as a country and most of all from being unafraid to start talking again about the values and principles we believe in and what they mean for us , not just as individuals but as a community . We can not exist in a moral vacuum . If we do not learn and then teach the value of what is right and what is wrong , then the result is simply moral chaos which engulfs us all . " <p> Blair received more than a thousand letters afterward . Long profiles of him began appearing in the press , a step up from the biographical summaries that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The news was the source  --  the Labor Party , " the party that saw crime as something got up by the fascist police busy repressing the working class , " as one commentator put it at the time . <p> Kinnock resigned as party leader to be replaced by yet another modernizer , John Smith . After Smith 's death from a heart attack in 1994 , the party , with the unions already weakened by changes in voting rules , chose Blair as leader . <p> Blair is annoyed by critical commentaries in the press about his " spin doctors " and his carefully orchestrated campaign . " Let me just tell you something , " he said in a recent television interview . " The Tories . . . had reams of spin doctors and press officers . They used to be a competent professional organization . " But " when we get a professional show everyone squeals like mad . ' Oh , it 's terribly unfair . ' The unprincipled Labor Party . They 're trying to get elected . <p> " It 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @
