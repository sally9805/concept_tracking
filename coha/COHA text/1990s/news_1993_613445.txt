<p> As the second half of the baseball season begins tonight with the Atlanta Braves playing host to the Pittsburgh Pirates , the Braves ' chances of erasing a nine-game deficit to the San Francisco Giants and winning the National League West seem as remote as cashing in on the Georgia Lottery . <p> The Braves do have at least one thing going for them - they have been the best second-half team in baseball over the past two years , winning 63 percent of their games . <p> That alone , however , is n't likely to be good enough this season . If the trend held , the Braves , currently 50-39 , would finish 96-66 . All the Giants ( 59-30 ) would have to do to close them out is win 38 of their last 73 games . <p> Nor is history on the side of the Braves . No team since the 1942-43- 44 St. Louis Cardinals has won three straight National League pennants , and no one has three-peated in the NL West . <p> It also does n't help that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of baseball in 1961 , the largest expansion-year All-Star break deficit a division winner has overcome was 4 1/2 games , the amount by which the 1969 Mets trailed the Cubs at midseason . ( For a dose of hope , however , consider that the Mets fell 9 1/2 games behind the Cubs on Aug. 13 ) . <p> The Braves have relatively few chances to help themselves , with just six games left against the Giants . It 's tough to imagine the Rockies , Mets , Padres and Marlins giving the Braves much help . Those four teams , with the worst records in the league , have a combined 22 games left against San Francisco and only 18 against Atlanta . <p> But as long as there is a magic number , and if you 're already counting it 's 65 ( the combination of San Francisco wins and Atlanta losses that would mathematically eliminate the Braves ) , there still is a chance . <p> But changes appear necessary . The status quo has left the Braves with a nine-game deficit . So it 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win their third straight NL West title . <p> - Score more runs : <p> The Braves in the first half hit just .248 , the lowest average in the majors , and produced barely four runs a game . <p> One option , if they do not get San Diego first baseman Fred McGriff , would be to promote a few prospects from Class AAA Richmond . First baseman Ryan Klesko has 15 home runs in 179 at-bats and participated in the Triple-A All-Star Game Wednesday night . He could be tried in the sixth slot in the batting order , currently occupied by the platoon of Sid Bream and Brian Hunter , neither of whom has hit well enough to prevent teams from pitching around Ron Gant , who hits fifth . Hunter is hitting .139 and Bream has RBIs in back-to-back starts only once since May 9 . <p> A move to bring up Klesko could come quicker than one to promote catcher Javier Lopez . While Atlanta 's catching has produced little beyond a few game-winning hits from Damon Berryhill , manager Bobby Cox still feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Braves might wait and see how Greg Olson and Berryhill play the next few weeks before making a decision about promoting Lopez . <p> The Braves also can make some moves internally . If center fielder Deion Sanders continues to struggle , Cox could use Otis Nixon against all pitchers , not just lefthanders . Also , if third baseman Terry Pendleton does n't increase his power numbers ( five home runs , 36 RBIs ) , Cox may need to swap him and Gant in the order . Gant has done well hitting in the No. 3 hole before . <p> The Braves also need some help from the bench , where there is no exclusively left-handed hitting . Reducing the pitching staff from 11 to 10 and bringing up either Klesko or Tony Tarasco from Richmond could help . The Braves have used as many as four relievers only 13 times , so there does n't appear to be a need for quantity in the bullpen . <p> - Keep the Fab Four fabulous : <p> The Braves ca n't ask much more out of their top four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the All-Star team , and Greg Maddux is fourth in the league in ERA ( 2.83 ) . They 're all on pace to pitch more than 200 innings , and with just a little more offensive support could become the first pitching staff since Baltimore in 1971 to have four starters win 20 games apiece . <p> The Braves have n't given up on fifth starter Pete Smith , who went 7- 0 last season but is 3-7 this year . If his problems continue , the Braves may be forced to go from a five-to a four-man rotation or replace Smith with reliever Kent Mercker , who was a part-time starter in 1991 . <p> - Regain the attitude : <p> The last two championship seasons , there has been a strong feeling of unity in the clubhouse , and an equally strong desire to win no matter what the cost . That has been absent this season , but getting back into the race could help it return . So could the chance to rally behind a player having a great season , as Terry Pendleton did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So could a winning streak . <p> - Where did all the streaks go : <p> Last year , the Braves had seven winning streaks of five games or more , including a 13-gamer . This year their longest streak has been four . The main reason ? The struggling offense . In 34 percent of the games in the first half , the Braves scored two runs or fewer , leaving their pitchers with the pressure of holding the opposition to one run . <p> The schedule favors a quick second-half start . A seven-game homestand opens with four games against the Pirates , who are four games under .500 , then three against the Cardinals , who went into the break losing two of three at home to the Rockies . For history buffs , the Cardinals were one of the teams the Braves played right after the break in 1991 when they knocked six games off the Dodgers ' 9 1/2-game lead in seven days . <p> - The Giants have to start losing : <p> The Braves can make all the moves they want , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter . They are on pace to win 107 games and are coming off a tough road trip where they still went 12-7 . They also open this half at home for 14 games , the first four against the Mets , and have 11 games left against the expansion teams . The Braves , meanwhile , have finished their season series with the Marlins and have six games left against the Rockies . <p> The key for the Giants is their pitching , which held up nicely in the first half but has shown some signs of weakening lately . Trevor Wilson is on the disabled list and the club is looking to trade for Montreal righthander Dennis Martinez . If that happens , the Braves might have to make other plans for October . <p> The Giants are getting healthier . They 'll get cleanup hitter Matt Williams , one of the league 's top power hitters , back this week . Second baseman Robby Thompson may have to go on the DL , but it would be retroactive to when he last played and he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Perhaps the biggest concern for the Braves is how few games ( six ) they have left against the Giants . Atlanta has to hope for help from other clubs . Problem is , if both divisional races become lopsided ( the Phillies lead the Cardinals in the East by five games ) , by late August most of the pitching staffs will be made up of minor-league callups . It 's frightening to think about what Barry Bonds and company will produce then . <p> Perhaps the Braves should look at it this way : If they can get within a game or two by the last weekend of the season , they 'll have a great chance . In those last three games , the Braves face the Rockies in Atlanta while the Giants travel to Los Angeles . There would be nothing more satisfying for Tommy Lasorda and his Dodgers than to knock the Giants out of it , even if it meant the Braves taking their third straight division title .
