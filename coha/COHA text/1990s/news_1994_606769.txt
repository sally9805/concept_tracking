" It gets them very excited . " Evidently . The secret ingredient in McNair 's new flourless chocolate souffle ' cake is a dollop of bittersweet chocolate ganache in the center that melts as the cake bakes . " When you cut into the warm cake , the chocolate goo spills out . " <p> So just how good is this goo ? Chef Dean Winning at New Heights in D.C. 's Woodley Park says one of his male customers was moaning over the warm dark chocolate truffle cake with melted bittersweet chocolate center when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you 've sure taken the pressure off me for later tonight . " <p> Yes . That good . <p> Pastry chef Matthew Lake says the seductive cake was added to the dessert menu last spring and he had planned to replace it with something else chocolate this fall . Silly man . " Our customers had a fit , " he says , professing surprise . <p> The story 's the same at the Old Angler 's Inn in Potomac , where the order-in-advance warm fondant cake with a soft and runny middle is wooing most dessert lovers , confirms pastry chef William Young . <p> Valerie Clark at the Morrison-Clark Inn downtown admits she , too , is working on a chocolate cake " with an oozy middle " for her next dessert menu . <p> Is the " oozy " the newest secret weapon in the dessert war ? <p> Lake thinks it 's deadly because warm chocolate makes us nostalgic , reminding us of those warm gooey chocolate chips in our mother 's cookies . <p> Yeah , right . It ai n't Mom we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes you feel sexy . Every pastry chef knows that , " she says in her best " **29;462;TOOLONG ? " tone . <p> Hill is even less romantic . " People like to get smacked in the face " when it comes to chocolate dessert . " None of this subtle stuff . Chocoholics want their desserts to sing chocolate . " <p> Ah , but maybe you can resist all the ooze and aahs . Maybe you just want your basic , decadent all-American chocolate overkill at dessert . <p> No problem , cocoa-craver . How about the Inn at Little Washington 's Chocolate Four Ways  --  a sampling of four impossibly rich chocolate desserts including  --  yes !  --  a warm Valrhona chocolate cake . <p> Or perhaps you 'd like a nice little chocolate dacquoise ? " Hazelnut meringue with semisweet chocolate mousse , coated with chocolate ganache , decorated with chocolate curls and a gold-foil rosette and served with cappuccino cre'me anglaise , " recites McNair . That 's how she and Kathryn Gordon make their top-seller at Kinkead 's . <p> Hill 's current best-selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted from California pastry chef Emily Luchetti .

As for melted middles , well , they 've been there , done that , this past spring and summer . Pastry chef Doug Wilson says his oozing five-inch-tall chocolate truffle tower was a hit , but he 's replaced it with a chocolate and coffee cre'me brule'e for fall . " We like to do new things , you know ? " <p> New , but still chocolate . As most pastry chefs realize , lots o ' dark brown on the dessert menu brings in lots o ' green for the cash register . <p> " Absolutely , " agrees veteran pastry chef Gale Gand of Chicago 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This simple , life-affirming philosophy has led Gand to come up with masterpieces like the Triple Chocolate Marquis , a dense chocolate mousse enriched with malt , flecked with dried cherries , surrounded by a collar of white and dark chocolate and supported by a platform of milk chocolate and nuts . <p> In other words , a $ 9 Chunky . <p> " The candy I ate in my childhood is my inspiration for all my desserts , " she admits . <p> Romance is , too .

This makes perfect sense because according to that University of Chicago survey that was in the paper last week , we 're rarely doing anything else in our bedrooms . <p> Do n't get depressed , though . When we 're not dribbling fudge pie crumbs on our satin sheets , Americans are eating dessert out at restaurants , something nearly 60 percent of us do , especially when we 're shelling out more than $ 25 per person for dinner , according to the National Restaurant Association . <p> Okay , you 're saying , but are n't people watching their calories ? Of course they are . That 's why they put Equal in their coffee and then order a chocolate dessert . <p> If you do n't believe me , consider that the latest restaurant association numbers show more people than ever ordering dessert .
