// Deciding to undo her latest " I dos , " Ivana splits from The Donald 's successor ON THE FACE OF IT , RICCARDO MAZZUCchelli seemed like the sort of debonair swain no romance addict could resist . A suave , attentive Italian with a RollsRoyce , a monied aura and a showy townhouse in London , he appeared in Ivana Trump 's life at a time when she was " very much the bounced Czech , " recalls Ivana pal and gossip columnist Cindy Adams . In the wake of Ivana 's humiliating 1990 breakup with The Donald , Mazzucchelli , an international businessman , wooed her like a pro-sending her a roomful of red roses after their first lunch date in 1991 , presenting her with a 10-carat diamond when he **29;506;TOOLONG that year and then offering an immense Burmese sapphire when he again asked for her hand in marriage three years later .

In a statement issued July 7 , the home shopping huckstress , 48 , announced that she and Mazzucchelli , 54 , had separated after a mere 20 months of marriage-and just weeks after the union of Donald and Ivana 's successor , Marla Maples , went under . Already , Ivana 's camp has labeled Mazzucchelli-a multimillionaire in his own right-a gold digger , and while both sides seem ready to start divorce proceedings , the patron saint of ex-wives and her third hubby are waging a spin war from opposite sides of the Atlantic : he , in his London digs ; she , in the luxe Manhattan townhouse purchased with proceeds from her $20 million-plus settlement with Trump .

" I love Riccardo . This is a tremendously hard time for me . It 's very painful to go through six years of relationship with a person and to be disappointed or filing for divorce or whatever . " Riccardo , too , claims to be heartbroken . " I loved Ivana a lot , and I think I did my very best . I did for her more than Donald ever did . " Though bound , like Ivana , by a confidentiality clause in their prenuptial agreement , he clearly is on the defensive-especially given the accusations of moneygrubbing , not only by his wife 's pals but by sources in Donald 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he complains . As for Donald , Mazzucchelli says , " he 's done nothing but knife me in the back . Maybe he 's jealous . " According to a source close to Trump , Donald believes that Ivana has decided who is the better man . " Everybody knows that Ivana 's in love with me , " he told friends . " This guy tried to compete with me from the start , and Ivana used him to get to me . She 's disappointed that it did n't work out on any level . " ( " That is n't true , " claims her publicist . ) One thing Ivana still has in common with Donald , however , is an understanding that , when it comes to divorce settlements , timing is money . By some accounts , Donald 's split with Marla was announced in May in order to preempt a prenup clause that would have given her a larger chunk of his $2.5 billion fortune if a divorce came later . ( Because he moved fast , she reportedly will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , a supermarket tabloid may have sparked the Mazzucchellis to go public by alleging that Ivana plans to shed Riccardo because she wants to protect her empire , which includes an accessories business , a fragrance collection and the $50 million-a-year House of Ivana clothing line peddled on TV 's ValueVision . The source close to Donald , at least , claims , " This man 's basic problem was that he was not the successful businessman he claimed to be . He was worth exactly what Donald gave to Ivana . " Retorts Mazzucchelli : " From what I read , I 'm painted as a gigolo . But she can have it all , with my compliments . It 's my parting gift to her . " Ivana , in her July 7 statement , asserted that " the apparent war of words " . . . is not my concern " and that " Riccardo 's claim that he dumped me is totally untrue !

" My prenup says what 's mine is mine and what 's his is his . It is ironclad . None of us are taking nothing from each other . " Beyond that , she added , " I do n't wash the dirty laundry in front of nobody . What happened , I really ca n't comment on it because of the confidentiality agreement . " Though some acquaintances seemed surprised by the news , the friction apparently began long before their splashy wedding at Manhattan 's Mayfair Hotel in November 1995 . Back on the singles scene in 1991 , and fortified by a breast augmentation and facial surgery , Ivana had met Mazzucchelli-the divorced father of a grown son-in London .

Photograph A Riccardo and Ivana ( in 1993 ) were once " desperately in love , " says a friend of his . // Yet Ivana , who had been briefly married before wedding Donald , took her time on the way to the altar . When the engagement was announced in April 1995 , she allowed , " I will never again be as trusting as I once was . But you have to take a chance . I think , Hey , what can happen ? ' " Set for June , the marriage was delayed by nearly six months-reportedly while Riccardo pondered the prenup . Though the pair seemed giddy on the big day , reports about squabbles in front of her children ( who divide their time between Donald 's homes and Ivana 's ) soon surfaced . " Riccardo and Ivana used to have incredible fights , " says her longtime friend Jackie Cowell . " I 've stayed with them . They were either fighting or crazy about each other . But Riccardo always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of attention . Riccardo was a like a prince consort to her . " Photograph IVANA BE IN PICTURES // Riccardo , it seems , found it difficult to live in her shadow-and to live with the ghost of Trump . The tension apparently escalated soon after their romance began ; he had sold his construction company and joined House of Ivana as CEO ( an unsalaried position for which he received 50 percent of the company ) . According to one source , Ivana continued to prefer Donald as an adviser . " She calls me whenever she has a problem with him or with anything , " Donald told the friend . " I never stopped hearing from her . " While Ivana 's friends cite his character flaws-Riccardo " is an extremely difficult person , always complaining , " says a Palm Beach pal-his own chums suggest that the marriage was sabotaged by their claustrophobic business relationship . " It must be very difficult to let off steam because you 're always together , " says Graham Williams , Mazzucchelli 's lawyer and longtime friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property owner with whom he is still close , believes the relationship may have become a test of wills . " It is unfortunate , the whole thing , " she says of his breakup . " Riccardo is quite macho . He has always been the protector of our family . Maybe Ivana did n't want to defer because she was dominated by Donald . " As for the allegation that he married Ivana for her money , " I ca n't understand that , " she says . " I had a cousin whom he had met once and was dying of cancer . He immediately sent the best doctors in Italy and provided for the family . He is not a taker . " Indeed , Mazzucchelli says that his London home is worth about $6 million and that he owns an apartment in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-surSierre . Other than that , he 's not prepared to discuss his assets . ( " That 's very American . " ) Rumors about marrying for money , he claims , " started with Ivana , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " filthy lies . " And , he adds , " are you going to marry a woman because of her bank account or because she is famous ? No , you marry her because you find someone you feel at home with . " No more , it seems . On July 8 her Manhattan lawyer Ira Garr filed a $15 million breach-of-contract suit against Riccardo for violating the confidentiality agreement . " When you have someone like Ivana , " says Garr , " an international celebrity , how she is perceived is very important in terms of her business interests . Image is important . " So is bravado . Ivana would like to stipulate that she is n't down for the count , is n't pining for Donald-and that divorce ( even one 's third ) is n't the end of anything except her brief marriage . " Do you think that I 'm going to lie down and die ? Not a chance , girl . Am I going to marry ? Absolutely ! What I really need is a little bit of brain-I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be old . You know , it 's a question of the chemistry and of two people being with each other . " In the meanwhile , she says , she has Ivana Inc. to keep her happy . " I have it very easy , " she says . " I have a million deals here and everywhere . I 'm going to be just fine , honey .
