The $200 billion-a-year electric-power industry slept for decades under a cozy blanket of cost-plus-profit income streams and fat dividends that seemed to promise payouts forever . The status quo is about to get a jolt from , among others , John W. Rowe , 52 , president and CEO of New England Electric System of Westborough , Mass . NEES is New England 's second largest power utility , with $2.3 billion in 1996 revenues and 5,000 employees . Under Rowe , the utility has become a leader in allowing consumers to shop around for electric power the same way they shop for long-distance telephone service . It also plans to largely take itself out of the power-generation game . <P> By Jan. 1 , 1998 , about 1.3 million households and businesses in Rhode Island and Massachusetts will have become pioneers in electric consumption as a result of landmark pacts that Rowe negotiated with each state . His achievement is the latest step in a process that began developing nearly two decades ago . As far back as the 1970s , independent producers started selling power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lines free of charge to such wholesalers . The growing wholesale competition created a demand for retail freedom of choice . <P> Rowe decided to make NEES the first electric utility to get out of power generation . Under its new marketing pacts , the company will cut customer rates 10% . It will also divest itself of 20 power-generation plants . The anticipated $1 billion or so from the sale , however , will not pay down NEES 's $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in " stranded costs "  --  capital and other expenditures related to mandated power contracts with independent producers . <P> After divestiture , NEES will morph into a power-transmission and - distribution company  --  and one that is still regulated at that . And in its new role , NEES will net enough  --  about 3cents per kW-h  --  to pay off its stranded-cost overhang . Rowe expects to make money , but he could make more if transmission were deregulated too , by charging more for access to his power cables , which reach 1.3 million homes and businesses . <P> Rowe has had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood on a Wisconsin farm with Depression-era parents who taught me to fear disaster , " he recalls . He studied law at the University of Wisconsin and in the early 1980s helped engineer Conrail 's financial turnaround . In the mid-1980s , as president of Central Maine Power , he steered the divestiture of the controversial Seabrook nuclear plant . Rowe compares himself to the pilot of Mark Twain 's Life on the Mississippi , " navigating shifting waters " where " the shore is never quite the same . " <P> Rowe talks of expanding NEES 's transmission network to twice its current size in five years . NEES now has a subsidiary to market natural gas and plans a partnership with a communications company to add phone and data service . " If we accept the gruesome realities of dealing with change , " he says , " there eventually will come a time when this business is fun again .
