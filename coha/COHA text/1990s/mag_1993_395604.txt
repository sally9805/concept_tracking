Maybe it 's just me , but most of my twentysomething friends are n't having sex unless they 're in a serious relationship . I ca n't remember the last locker-room story from sisters or brothers about picking up some P.Y.T. ( Pretty Young Thang ) and taking him or her home for the night . When we go out , the only piece we 're looking for is a piece of paper with seven digits on it . When we meet some attractive brother and say we want to get to know him better , it 's not just a line . Our folks may have invented free love , but we 're going to know a lot more than a lover 's first name before we go to bed with him . Not that casual sex is n't appealing , but for my generation , sleeping around is out . We do n't call ourselves celibate , we call ourselves smart . AIDS is nothing to play with . We are the first generation to grow up with this twentieth-century plague . We 're the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die from it . We came of age with the terrifying knowledge that unsafe sex could kill us . When Magic Johnson announced that he was HIV-positive , the urgency of AIDS in our community finally hit home to all those who had never lost anyone . For the vast majority of us , celibacy beats death and we 're beginning to live our lives accordingly . " Sex is not something you do without some emotional involvement , especially because you could be infected with some sort of deadly virus , " says Diane Greer ( the names of those interviewed have been changed ) , a 29-year-old television producer . " I 've been celibate for seven months , and it 's not that I planned it that way . It 's not that I 'm unwilling , but I 'm not going to rush into sex right away . " Mae Williams , a 21-year-old college senior , has noticed that AIDS has also changed the rules of sexual pursuit among people she knows at Howard University . Mae , a virgin , says candidly , " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that free love . I know this to be true  --  a lot of students are n't having sex and are n't ashamed to say so . AIDS scares all of us . " Despite the fact that a lot of guys told me that they had been celibate for some period of time , it was tough to find a brother who would talk about it for the record . Jimmy Baker , 20 years old and a junior at the University of Pittsburgh , is n't concerned about being the Big Man on Campus . He has been celibate for " 450 days and counting . " But Jimmy believes that many young men who claim to be celibate or who say they practice safe sex are stretching the truth . " I think people are talking a good game , but when it comes down to it , a lot of brothers and sisters are out there living foul . " AIDS is not the only issue affecting our sexual behavior , unwanted pregnancy is also on our minds . For college students , as well as young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child just does not fit the picture . Call it the Buppie factor . As Dr. Lynda Smith Harris , a psychiatrist based in New York City , explains , " I think people are realizing that it 's not wise economically  --  it 's not " upwardly mobile "  --  to have children before they 're ready . " That 's what Mae , who knows she will do important things someday , feels . " When it comes to the heat of the moment , the thought of getting pregnant and having to drop out of school is like a cold shower , " she says . Jimmy Baker agrees . " My kids , when I finally have them , will be young compared with my friends ' kids . A lot of my friends have made mistakes , and I 'm learning from theirs . That 's another reason I 'm taking things slower . I 'm in school now . I 'm not ready to be a father yet . " IT 'S A BLACK THANG The importance of Afrocentricity has changed sexual dynamics for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride goes deeper than a Malcolm X T-shirt will not be " living foul , " as Jimmy put it . As Harris , the New York City psychiatrist , observes , " I 'm noticing that a lot of young Black people are becoming more Afrocentric  --  wearing African clothes and hairstyles  --  and connecting with Africa culturally . Perhaps because Afrocentricity is so popular , young adults feel more comfortable associating themselves with more traditional African values . " This was definitely the case for Greg Mooreland and his girlfriend , Tanya Reed . Greg joined the Nation of Islam last October , and Tanya attends meetings , but is still " straddling the fence . " Explains Greg , 20 , " Clearly , it was an Afrocentric mind-set that led me to the Nation . I 'd been exploring my roots and wanted the discipline and community of an African organization . " Tanya and Greg have been celibate for two months  --  his idea more than hers . " I was feeling guilty that we were breaking the Nation 's rules about premarital sex . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big issue , a controlling factor in my life . I think for most men there are these times when sex is the predominant thought on their mind throughout the day . I felt that I could rise to higher levels , spiritually and mentally , if I was n't so focused on sex . " Tanya , 23 , concurs : " It was at a point where Greg and I were doing it all the time . We needed to take a break . " Both Greg and Tanya think that celibacy has strengthened their relationship . He says , " My relationship with Tanya has gotten deeper . When we 're having sex , we did n't talk as much . Now that we 're not having sex , we do more  --  we go out more often and we spend more time just talking . " She says , " We 've learned more about each other , we 're clearer about why we want to be together because we 've moved to a higher level . We communicate much better , we really listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . " Both Greg and Tanya agree that at times it 's difficult to abstain because they have already slept together . But as Creg points out , " We 're still physical with each other . We often sleep together , but we do n't have sex . We just enjoy being close . And it 's not like we 'll never have sex , but when we do , it will be further down the line , and our relationship will be much richer for it . " Jimmy Baker , who is in a relationship , is also delaying sexual intercourse . " To me , it seems like in a good relationship there 's more than being just physically intimate . I 'm not in any hurry to have sex with the woman I 'm involved with , " he says . " When you 're with the right person , you want to have an emotional foundation . I 've had a couple of relationships that were just physical , and they never worked out . " For many young adults , and for women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about waiting for the right person . Says Desiree Hargrove , 22 , " I think that getting to know somebody personally before you get to know them intimately is so important . Sex too soon is like putting the cart before the horse , you get nowhere fast . " But Desiree also realizes that " when you say that you want a certain emotional attachment , you find the pack thins out pretty quickly . There are n't huge numbers of men who are interested in wining and dining  --  the big C ( courting )  --  before sex . I think as long as they can have sex without commitment , most men will opt for that . " Diane Greer attributes this " Do what I want , or see ya " attitude to the numbers game that Black men and women must play . " In our community , there 's one man for every ten women . I feel one reason I 'm alone is that so many women out there are willing to do anything . If you do n't have sex on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the new celibacy " is a way of redefining sexual relationships between men and women in our community . " There 's been a lot of turmoil between Black men and Black women , " points out Harris , " but for a man to misuse you , you have to participate in that . More women are , in psychological terms , starting to set limits . More women should say " If you want to be with me , you 're going to have to be more committed before we have sex . ' " It appears that men and women have a different perspective on sexual relationships , " Harris continues . " Women tend to view sex as part of a committed relationship , whereas often when men have sex they 're after sexual satisfaction . Your chances of finding a real relationship are better if you put sex off . We need to think about the choices we 're making . Is this someone you can bare yourself to ? Not just physically , but emotionally . " Diane admits , " In some ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not having some wonderful man share my bed , but to do that I 'd have to be an emotionally uninvolved person . If I were willing to have casual sex , there 'd be no dearth of men . But I 've learned , and I think a lot of women have , that casual sex can leave you feeling hurt , cheap and used . " " I 'm saner , " laughs Desiree . " When I 'm intimate with another person , I 'm consumed wondering how long we 'll be together , consumed with the relationship . " Mae Williams says simply , " I hold sex in very high regard . I do n't think it should be shared with just anyone . I do n't have time for casual sex , it 's too addictive . I 've seen people fall into a pattern of nonrelationships . Those are worries I do n't want . " Make no mistake about this , though : The new celibacy is n't the new morality . Says Diane Greer , " Just because you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're engaging in sex on different levels . " LIFE WITHOUT SEX I 've gone a year without sex . There , I 've said it . It 's not as painful as it sounds  --  it 's worse . During the last 365 days , I 've developed a new respect for priests , nuns and eunuchs . But then again , we 're really not in the same boat : They do n't know what they 're missing . I am 24 years old , five foot two , 125 pounds . I have a college degree and I 'm employed and healthy . I work out regularly . I have to . The tension has to go somewhere , and I 'd rather be buff than bonkers . I 'm also living in a South Florida city where the prospects for Black male companionship are not impressive . Living here for two years and two months has introduced me to new sides of boredom , loneliness and staying busy . Staying busy helps me combat the other two , and I come out a more productive and efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any closer to having sex . When I 'm bored , I read . When I 'm lonely , I call friends , and we go to the movies . And when I 'm busy , I work . ( I know , I know . It 's all so-o-o exciting ! ) I do n't date anymore . I tried it a couple of times with dismal romantic results  --  but with decent friendship ones . I liked the men . They were educated , sensitive , caring . We went to plays , took walks along moonlit beaches , talked for hours and laughed at each other 's jokes . They , too , had degrees and were employed and healthy . They also lit a fire like one made by rubbing two twigs together in a downpour . I 've had about five dates in the last two years , three with the same guy , who was only in town for two weeks . We had a lot in common  --  went to the same university , knew a lot of the same people , did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same minimal degree . But we split company in the sex department . He found me exciting , I found him brotherly  --  a deadly combination . Now we write and call with casual friendliness . I never expected a dry spell to last this long . This time two years ago , I thought I 'd be back in the groove in six months  --  tops . But weeks became months , months became ( gasp ! ) a year . I realized I had n't gone this long without sex since I started having it . My mind plays tricks on me during this forced chastity . At first , I thought it was a good thing . " AIDS , " I said . " Sexual diseases , " I said . " The condom thing , " I said . " What if he 's a lousy lover , and I end up wasting my time , " I said . " The morning after ... " And the list continued until it seemed that the sexually active were the stupidest people in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd catch a sex scene at the movies or on the soaps . Or read a steamy passage in a grocery-store novel and be back in the sweaty depths of horny hell . My mind would go into twisted , erotic convolutions , picturing everyone I knew getting the sex I was n't , in positions and places I 'd only seen in erotic films . I 'd start dreaming about old , discarded boyfriends , men whose calls I did n't return , and the steroid-loaded jocks at the gym . At work , I 'd sit at my desk , X-rated reels in my mind . At home , the still air seemed charged with an electricity that was all in my head . " Anybody , Anybody ! Anybody would do ! " Then sanity would inject itself , and I 'd remember that just anybody would n't do . So I have n't had any for 12 months . No hugs , no kisses , no hairy feet crowding the bottom of the bed , no morning stubble or sheet twister . I 've gotten picky in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoldering warmth , the frantic fumbling in backseats and the walks in the park , the intense conversation and the pillow talk . I want a nice guy who knocks my boots off . And I guess until I find this person , this wonderful person , this cure-all for my ills , I 'll remain celibate and single .
