CONTEMPLATING THE IMPOSSIBLE : OR , HOW I LEARNED TO FLY <p> My parents raised their children the way they were raised : with abuse . <p> Mom : " Even after you 've just showered , you smell ! " <p> Dad : " Fat Ass . Fat Ass ! We 'll call your sister Fat Ass . ' <p> Chorus of siblings : " Fat Ass ! Fat Ass ! " <p> I escaped from the family horrors into secret dreams : daydreams and night dreams . I dreamed I was free . I roamed vast vaults of blue . Clouds as big as mountains created constantly changing skyscapes through which I soared . <p> Underneath the bedclothes , late at night and on into the dawn , the yellow glow of a flashlight lit the words that opened the worlds of Beryl Markham , Amelia Earhart , and Charles Lindbergh to me . Through the night the engines droned , and the stars surrounded us as we winged our way across oceans and continents . In these worlds of imagination I was brave and bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . <p> I left home at seventeen , as soon as I could escape . I carried away with me , however , a head full of voices that continued to direct my life . When I longed for adventure or accomplishment , the voices told me I would always fail . When I sought love or friendship , whispers said I was unlovable and warned that to try was only to invite hurt . I believed these voices . I thought they were my voices , reminding me of the truth . <p> Slowly , with much help , other voices came into my life . Those of friends , lovers , bosses . They complimented me for a job well done . Most important , they liked me . Some even loved me . <p> Occasionally , the bad voices would become so dim that another voice would break through , beckoning adventure , inviting risk . The siren call of the impossible would lure me from my doubt into the open space of maybe , into the wild blue yonder of possibilities . ( Sirens are mythical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks and sing so sweetly that sailors are lured to their deaths , crashing their ships against the rocks . ) <p> Despite my childhood fantasies of flying , I was afraid of heights . Venturing out on a sixth-floor balcony made my breathing ragged and my heart race . But this siren sang so seductively to me , she of the high air , calling me to the place of fear and fascination . <p> I took diving lessons . The diving board was only two meters above the water , but the gyrations of back dives , jackknives , and half-twists were enough to make the short fall quite thrilling . <p> Flying through the air , poised above the water , I began to hear another siren song . She also sang from the heights , but from a loftier realm . Underneath her sweet voice was an ostinato of droning engines . Beryl , Amelia , and Charles sang harmony . <p> In shrill discord , other voices sang a litany of my faults . " Scatterbrained ! " they shrieked . " Loser , ' fraidy-cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two choruses warred in clangorous cacophony . <p> Then I saw the poster : University Flying Club . <p> I had returned to school and was working on a master 's degree in film , video , and theater . In the hallways of the school was this marvelous flier , beckoning . <p> I called the phone number listed on the poster . Ground school started the following week . It was free . And attending ground school did not commit me to actually going up in an airplane . <p> I went . One other woman attended , and fourteen men . The other woman was a petite , blond , very pretty , and very self-confident Frenchwoman . The men , including the instructor , buzzed around her like bees around a queen . <p> Every one of the fifteen other students took a flight lesson within the first three weeks of ground school . One macho-man , who had told us all how eager he was to fly , barfed all over the plane his first time up . This incident cranked up the terror meter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only unafraid but eager to fly , had been reduced to a puking wreck , what indecencies might I be reduced to in the extremities of terror ? I shuddered to imagine . <p> The weeks passed . I was still on the ground . I loved ground school . I , who had hated and feared math class , loved the calculations of flight . I , who got lost regularly , adored navigation . I , who had dreaded science class , delighted in meteorology . I , notorious for lack of attention to detail , was entranced with the precision of flight . I , who was sloppy and careless , found joy in the de-mands of flight , where so much must be perfect , precise , checked and rechecked with extreme care . I , a coward , thrill-ed at contemplating the risks of flight . <p> I spent hours plotting routes with rulers and flight charts ( aeronautical maps ) . Would a planned flight altitude of 5000 feet clear all the obstacles ? How high is that mountain ? What is the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a head wind that increases flight time by two hours ? What is the temperature at 5000 feet ? Will ice accumulate on the wings ? What kinds of clouds are there today ? ( Cumulus mean bumpy air . ) <p> Finally , the language , the numbers , the charts , the clouds , and the winds , as well as the expressions of fevered ecstasy on the faces of some of my fellow students recently returned from flight lessons , lured me to the airport . <p> My flight instructor was a tall , blond , and courtly Dutchman whose name was Ducco . He immediately led me out to the ramp ( aircraft parking area ) and began to show me how to do a preflight check of the airplane . The plane was a Cessna 182 , a SkyHawk . It looked very fragile . Its body was a hollow of thin metal sheeting held together with thinner wires and a few bolts . <p> Ducco was smooth , confident , relaxed . He moved through the preflight with the ease of long practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strapped into the cockpit with a confusing babble of incomprehensible instructions coming through the headset and Ducco guiding the plane through a maze of taxiways toward the runway . He stopped just short of the runway in the run-up area , where the preflight check is completed by " running up " the engine to flight speeds , confirming the mobility and responsiveness of all flight controls ( flaps , rudder , ailerons ) , and checking and rechecking gauges and instruments . <p> The tower cleared us for takeoff , and Ducco moved the SkyHawk to the end of the runway . He turned to me and said , " Okay , you take off . " <p> I stared at him in slack-jawed amazement . " What ! " I gasped . " You 've covered this in ground school , have n't you ? " <p> " Yes , " I spluttered , " but theory is one thing and reality quite another ! " <p> " I 'll talk you through it , " he said confidently , ignoring the hysterical edge to my voice , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Now , put your left hand lightly on the yoke ( steering wheel ) , put your right hand on the throttle ( gas or speed control ) , lift your heels from the brakes , and control the ailerons ( wing flaps , which control turns ) with your toes .... " <p> Ducco seemed so absolutely sure that I could and would do as he said  --  that I did ! There were at least ten things to do at any one time . Six instruments and gauges had to be monitored . Direction , altitude , pitch ( up or down ) , and speed must be directed . And a constant lookout for other airplanes must be maintained : there are no roads in the sky , and another airplane can come at you from any direction , including from underneath . I was much too busy to get scared . As soon as I got the hang of straight and level flight and had enough free attention to look out the window and notice how far below us the ground was , Ducco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me through it , and again I was so busy that another impossibility had sneaked across the dream horizon into my reality . <p> During each of the lessons to follow , Ducco would ask me to do something I fervently believed was utterly impossible . And each time I did the impossible . <p> I still had dreams about flying . But now they were of crashing and burning . Many nights I would gasp awake , drenched with sweat , from a dream of making a fatal error in the air . Yet twice a week the siren of the stratosphere would sing , and I would follow her song once again into the SkyHawk , where Ducco would get me to do more impossible maneuvers . <p> For example , stalls . A stall is when an aircraft loses lift and begins to fall out of the sky . Exactly the content of my nightmares . <p> A stall can happen at any time , and it happens very fast . The nose suddenly points earthward and the plane begins to spin out of control . Earth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot literally has no idea which way is up . <p> To simulate this emergency , Ducco pulled back on the yoke , pointing the nose almost straight up . This caused the wings to become vertical and lose lift . The nose suddenly plummeted down , the plane began to spin to the left , and the stall warning horn filled the cockpit with its nasty blare . <p> Ducco calmly brought the aircraft back to straight and level flight , and said , " Now you do it . " <p> I think I just laughed . A weak laugh , which sounded similar to a faint scream . I made him demonstrate the stall three more times . Then he insisted that I give it a try . <p> Eventually , to my astonishment , stalls became one of my favorite maneuvers . They were like a roller coaster ride  --  fun and wild and a little bit dangerous . Also , it was a difficult maneuver , and I had mastered it . I could stop the plane from falling out of the sky . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , Ducco was sitting in the other seat , with dual controls . I knew that he knew how to fly , I knew that he did n't plan to commit suicide via a student 's error , and I knew that he would deftly take over the controls ( as indeed he did many times ) if I made a mistake . <p> As I improved , Ducco evidenced more confidence in my abilities . One dawn , as I sat in the cockpit , finishing preparations for an early flight , Ducco slid into the other seat , dressed in spotless whites , a full cup of coffee in his hands . With mock severity , he told me that he 'd better not have a drop of coffee on his whites by the end of our lesson . It was a challenge and an honor . Ducco 's whites were perfect at the end of our lesson . <p> Finally , Ducco told me during one lesson that he thought I was ready to solo . I told him I was n't . He insisted that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward landing . Ducco revised his opinion . <p> This pattern continued for more than a month . Ducco would tell me I was ready to solo , and I would make a serious error during a flight maneuver . Finally , I told him that my subconscious was sabotaging my changes of ever soloing . I asked him not to tell me when he was going to solo me . <p> The dreaded moment came . We had been practicing landings , doing endless touch-and-goes ( which are exactly what they sound like  --  as soon as all three wheels are down , you give the engine full throttle and take off again ) . Finally , Ducco radioed the tower for a full-stop landing . I was grateful the lesson was over . I was tired . I landed and turned off on the first taxiway . As I was reaching to switch the radio from tower to ground control frequency , Ducco radioed the tower , asking if he could solo his student  --  me ! They radioed back permission immediately , and Ducco slid out the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the propeller . <p> Alone in the cockpit , I panicked . Then the tower radioed me with taxi instructions back to the run-up area . Automatically , I replied and began to proceed through the criss-crossing taxiways and runways . <p> When I arrived at the run-up area , my panic returned . For several moments I was frozen with fear . Through whirling images of crashing and burning , through waves of adrenaline and terror , I forced myself to think about what I needed to do next . <p> Preflight procedures ! I had done them hundreds of times . I went methodically through the preflight checklist . Three times . <p> I began to panic again . Then I realized that I was not really terrified of taking off . Nor did flying the pattern  --  a rectangle around the airport  --  present any problems . A first solo consists of taking off , flying around to the beginning of the runway again , and landing . About a ten-minute flight . <p> Before I lost my nerve , I radioed the tower that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxied to the end of the runway . <p> In full throttle , a plane will lift into the air by itself when it reaches the proper speed . I released the brakes and gave it full throttle , the SkyHawk flung itself into the air , and I went along . Nervously , carefully , I made the turns to bring me back to the beginning of the runway , reporting my position to the tower as I made each turn . <p> Landing is the most difficult part of flying , even for experienced pilots . Aircraft are fragile , made for the insubstantial element of air . During landing they must make the transition , at high speeds , from soft air to rock solid earth . Gently . <p> It is said that any landing you can walk away from is a good landing . A bad landing is your last mistake : the penalty for a bad landing is death . <p> As I flew the downwind leg , turned to crosswind and into final approach , I reviewed landing procedures . I throttled back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slower air speed . I began to descend , lining the plane up carefully with the stripe down the middle of the runway . <p> The last few seconds are the really tricky part . The aim is to fly the plane to a foot or two off the ground , slowly , just above stall speed . Then , at the last moment , you flare  --  lift the nose of the plane and cause it to stall , lose lift , and gently drop the last few inches to the ground . Flare too high and you drop out of the air from a possibly fatal height . Flare too low and you either fly into the runway or run out of runway before you can get down . <p> As I came in over the end of the runway , I concentrated fiercely . I carefully flew lower , flared , and allowed the main wheels to touch down . I held the nose up as long as possible , letting the nose wheel settle to the earth in its own time . <p> It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but the form was handsome , which did not go unnoticed . The flight controller in the tower complimented me and congratulated me on my solo . <p> The next day I returned to the airport for another lesson . Ducco rode around the flight pattern with me for two landings , and then he hopped out and told me to go have some fun on my own . <p> His exit from the plane once again caused a wave of panic to surge up from the deep well of self-doubt . Reminding myself of the previous day 's events , I gritted my teeth and took off . I headed up above the Hudson River . Within ten minutes my fears were gone , and exhilaration had captured me . I laughed . I cried . I sang . I had a very good time . <p> I looked over at the empty seat beside me . I looked out at the vast blue sky around me . Hot damn !
