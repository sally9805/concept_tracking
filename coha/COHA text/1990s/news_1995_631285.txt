<p> It is true that ivy shrouds the handsome old walls of Cornell University . That the city of Ithaca is tucked among rolling hills and plunging gorges of western central New York state . That the Finger Lakes ripple nearby . And that in a former school building in downtown Ithaca , the Moosewood Restaurant offers up its hallowed vegetables . For these reasons , many people visit . <p> Not me . I came to make trouble for the staff of the Statler Hotel . <p> The Statler is a 150-room hotel on the Cornell campus . It is run by students of Cornell 's School of Hotel Administration , long known as the foremost program of its kind in the country . <p> In years to come , these students will join the leaders of the lodging industry , managing major properties , settling celebrities into $ 300-a-night rooms , setting fire to desserts , networking with fellow members of Cornell Society of Hotelmen ( whose president last year was a woman ) , and arching eyebrows when travelers like me arrive in their lobbies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for now , Cornell 's hoteliers are still pups , and checking into the Ithaca Statler is something like taking a seat in a barber 's college . <p> Now , imagine the hotel guest from hell  --  a writer traveling undercover who arrives on the day after the busiest weekend of the year , makes repeated , assorted and ambiguous requests , and takes notes as he goes . Would n't such a guest give a few young hoteliers a chance to show grace ( or a lack of it ) under pressure ? <p> About now , my wife , Mary Frances , who possesses no mean bones in her body , would step in to stress that there were other factors in favor of this expedition ( visiting our good friends Chuck and Kim , who live just outside Ithaca , being just one ) . Ithaca is a place generally given over to studying , hiking , fishing , boating , antiquing and wine-tasting . But the bottom line is that I saw a chance to be cruel , and I took it . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornell , a part-public , part-private university with enrollment of about 19,000 and a 745-acre campus , dominates the place . <p> In the middle of the grassy campus stands the Statler Hotel , rectangular and generic , its interior arranged in the Hyatt ; Marriott ; Hilton ; Sheraton tradition of distinguished , inoffensive furnishings , subdued lighting and dark woods . Commemorative plates acknowledge contributions from various big names in the hotel business , many of them connected with the building 's opening in 1989 . The adjoining executive education center is named for Marriott , the library for Stouffer , the cocktail lounge for Regent ( now known as Four Seasons Regent ) , the fancy restaurant , Banfi 's , for a prominent winemaking family . <p> The hotel is not , unfortunately , as cheap as a barber 's college haircut . The Statler , the costliest hotel in town , sets its rates at $ 140-$ 155 nightly for double rooms and disdains discounting for weekend and leisure travelers . ( Cornell employees and groups do get special rates . ) <p> My troublemaking had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservation using a relatively obscure discount card : Impulse , which promised 50 percent on nights of low demand . Sure enough , the student reservationists on that shift were neither briefed on the discount nor empowered to offer it . My reservationist suggested I call back during their business hours . <p> This , I thought , is going to be interesting . <p> But a reservationist on the day shift was , in fact , able to help me , and my wife and I were soon booked in a view room for $ 77.50 a night , and ready to bring our spying campaign onto the premises . <p> We thought timing would be important . Graduation ceremonies had been held May 27 and 28 , probably the most demanding days of the year for the Statler . We rolled up on May 29 at about 1 p.m.  --  two hours before the hotel 's specified check-in time . Then we called for a valet to park our car , a bellman to take our bags and a clerk to find us a room immediately . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine room ( on the seventh floor , with a broad view of Sage Chapel , the McGraw Tower atop Uris Library , and the green hills of Ithaca beyond ) , and a bellman was soon hanging up our coats ( without being asked ; very nice ) and telling us which restaurants were open . <p> The restaurants are among the Statler 's appealing eccentricities as a teaching hotel : Along with Banfi 's there is the Statler 's 200-seat Terrace Cafe and Bistro , where a weekday diner may find the cuisine and atmosphere Arabian , Israeli , Mexican or Thai , depending upon the student-devised theme of the day . Serving four nights a week , the cafe offers more than 40 themes and cuisines in the course of a 13-week semester . <p> Unfortunately , if you arrive on the day after graduation , that restaurant is closed . So we headed downstairs to Banfi 's to grab a late lunch and perhaps catch the staff napping . And so we did . The place was almost empty , yet several minutes passed before a host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waiter smoothed things over , expertly explained the menu , and promptly brought us a tasty sandwich , mini-pizza and chocolate raspberry cheesecake . He was n't even a hospitality industry student , it turned out , just an undergraduate who needed a job . <p> Among the Statler work force , about 75 are full-time professionals and about 200 are students , identifiable by the name tags that also give their anticipated year of graduation : Chris , ' 97 . Tom , ' 96 . ( Hotel school students are required to put in 800 hours of work in the industry before graduation . ) Later , we set to inspecting our quarters , beginning with the bathroom . There was no phone in there ( subtract one point ) , but there was a remote television speaker , so that we could keep up with Bosnia and DNA testimony while showering ( add one point ) . The rest of the room had the same prosperous , vaguely corporate feel as the lobby . The window opened , the bulbs lit , the drawers slid . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired by the Swiss institutions that for generations have produced top European hoteliers . Cornell 's program was the first of its kind in the United States . These days , it counts more than 50 faculty members , and about 800 undergraduate and graduate students whose schedules are built around classes such as Organizational Behavior and Interpersonal Skills , Casino Management , Business and Hospitality Law and Wine in Culture and History . But Cornell 's on-campus hotel has not always been so nice . <p> Before 1989 , the campus hotel was known as the Statler Inn , and had fewer than 60 rooms in far less impressive facilities  --  " an embarrassment , " in the words of one graduate . And even in its new quarters , the hotel faltered at first , attempting to deliver five-star service and setting prices so high that a state employee on business trips could n't afford to stay there . <p> In 1991 , the hotel brought in a new general manager and decided to aim for four-star service instead of five . ( The Mobil Travel Guide gives it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dean David A. Dittman , the hotel turns a profit . <p> The school , meanwhile , no longer has the field to itself . Scores of U.S. colleges now offer four-year degrees in one aspect or another of hospitality industry management . <p> Later that night , I hung out a breakfast order that called for either one continental breakfast or two , depending on how the kitchen staff read it . When a waiter arrived in the morning ( exactly on time ) , I sensed victory : He had brought one continental breakfast instead of two . I pointed to the order and explained that we had had two breakfasts in mind . <p> The waiter looked as if he had been struck by a nun with a ruler . He apologized for the misunderstanding and backpedaled rapidly out of the room . A few moments later he was back with another breakfast  --  and assurances that we would n't be charged for it . In the trade , I learned later , this is known as " service recovery . " <p> In my book , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge my failure as a troublemaker . Two hours later , we checked out .
