Nice casual clothing will do , but suits and silk dresses are not uncommon . Tables covered with cloth and paper sport vases of fresh flowers . There are about 12 tables in all , so things get a bit tight when the place is full , but Edith Piaf and other French music flowing from the speakers soothes nicely . There is n't much else in the way of decor to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for kids . <p> Dress code ? no <p> Service : Subdued and civilized .

Some nice wine selections by the half-bottle . <p> The view from the storefront window of this small cafe is the Metra as it lumbers by every 20 minutes or so . To the right are a garage and a plumbing operation . To the left is another storefront something-or-other . <p> You get the picture . <p> The setting for Jilly 's Cafe in Evanston is not exactly platinum , but there is something precious about the place , not the least of which is the absorbing and eclectic menu whose main focus is French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of America , some of Italy and more . <p> Jilly 's Cafe has been quietly going about its business for around 10 years now , all the while pleasing the dining cognoscenti ( the customers are an interesting mix of Northwestern University faculty members and others who appear to be well-heeled students ) of Evanston . <p> Jilly 's is hardly the kind of place that you just stumble on , though with its ambitious lunch , brunch and dinner schedule , it offers every opportunity to do so . To say that this intimate cafe is off the beaten track is more than a play on words , as the main dining action in Evanston is actually quite a few blocks to the east , where the eating options seem to get more eclectic every day . Along with that culinary buzz comes the inevitable beehive-full of customers , which translates to noisy restaurants . <p> No bull <p> All the better for Jilly 's , as it turns out , because the place does have a certain je ne sais quoi , not the least of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good way to describe owner Eric Rauch as he moves nimbly around the 12 tables , giving his attention to various details ( move this wineglass ; take that wineglass away ; rearrange a napkin ) . I would not say that Rauch is the most gregarious host who ever trod the restaurant boards , but what he lacks in the smiles department he makes up for in the way the restaurant is run , which is like a well-oiled machine . Things happen when and how they should ; there are no bulls on the loose in this eating arena . We 'll even bet that the upcoming arrival of new head chef wo n't disrupt a detail at Jilly 's . This is Rauch 's place . <p> The two-page menu is easy to deal with . The left side , while not set in stone , is a pretty solid arrangement of the basics  --  appetizers , soups , salads , pastas and entrees . The right side  --  the daily specials  --  is where matters move and shake a bit and where the creativity develops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays more attention to the daily specials than to the basic menu items . After awhile the basic dishes become so much ho-hum on the plate , while the specials offer a reason to get things humming . ) <p> Either way you go , the distinct possibility exists that you could , because soup or salad and an intermezzo of sorbet are included in the price , have a delicious meal for about $ 15 ( with dessert , but before tax and tip ) , with the average meal price somewhere around $ 20 . Now that alone is reason enough to put Jilly 's Cafe on your to-eat-at list . <p> We took more than a few bites out of both pages of the menu ( did I mention how interesting a menu it is ? ) and came away perfectly satisfied . The desserts  --  two trays ' worth , which are carefully explained and cover a lot of calories  --  are as interesting and diverse as the rest of the menu . <p> Openers <p> Do n't miss , either , the soup du jour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rich and chock full of diced vegetables , which had a tendency to move it beyond corn chowder per se , but it was good and flavorful . The daily soup one evening was a butternut squash affair . Silky-smooth and gently laced with cinnamon and nutmeg , it was a perfect soup for an autumn eve . <p> There was a lot of culinary flavor play going on in many of the dishes . An appetizer of grilled shrimp , for example , was stirred passionately by its accompanying fragrant gazpacho sauce and a touch of cilantro yogurt , both of which turned basic grilled shrimp into something much more interesting . <p> On the daily specials side of the menu , a nifty salad ; appetizer arrangement of baby lettuces coupled with asparagus and blue cheese , chopped egg and crunchy croutons in a dazzling and delightful fashion . The menu suggested that a drizzle of raspberry vinaigrette finished this salad off , and it did just that , but with a lightness ( thank you ) that did not take away from the other flavors . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the menu offerings but would find sustenance in one of the three pasta dishes : the capellini with a basil- and garlic-laced tomato sauce ( it has a pleasant spiciness ) and studded with chunks of zucchini and artichokes . The price is just $ 8.50 , and the portion is quite large . <p> The " grilled medallions of pork in pecan-mustard crust on polenta with peach chutney " were great . If that does n't give you a flavor overview of the menu here , nothing will . Wisely , the nuts encrusting the outside of the slices of wonderfully flavored pork had been finely ground , giving diners the full flavor but without any unpleasant crunch . And the pairing of the peach chutney with the pork was right on the money . The polenta was so-so . <p> Sauteed escolar , the chic fish of the moment , was one of the fish specials one evening ( Alaskan halibut was another ) . The stark-white , firm yet fleshy fillets of escolar were artfully arranged , tipsy skyscraper fashion , with " floors " of thinly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not just a pretty picture , but a delicious one as well , with button mushrooms and a mushroom broth adding another dimension of flavor . <p> Desserts <p> The dessert trays held the likes of creme brulee and lemon-almond pie , tiramisu and chocolate crepe with chocolate mousse , mixed fruit cobbler and flourless chocolate cake . The desserts we sampled were excellent . The coffee creme brulee was thick and custardy and rife with coffee flavor . <p> A " trio " that consisted of thick and fudgy flourless chocolate cake , a dollop of caramel mousse and a barquette of pastry filled with slices of fresh strawberries was a grand play of flavors and textures . Finally , a cobbler of mixed fruits was dark and sweet , the cobbler part nothing more than simple leaves of sweet pastry laid over the top . Bon appetit ! <p> Friday in WeekendPlus : Pat Bruno talks about the terrible tiramisus and other trendy desserts.
