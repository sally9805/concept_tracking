Silicon Valley : the place is synonymous with bright ideas , fresh fortunes and sunny forecasts . But right now the mood in this region 40 miles southeast of San Francisco suggests a name like Gloomy Gulch . Gone are the days when development spread like brush fire across the region and upstart businesses leaped from garages to the FORTUNE 500 . Absent are the fuzzy-cheeked genius entrepreneurs , the companies hungry for workers and a city so wealthy it once considered giving back $1 million in tax revenues to its citizens . Says Lawrence Stone , a city councilman in Sunnyvale , which no longer has a surplus , as he recalls the glory days : " Instant millionaires . Every day there was a firm doing a public offering and spin-offs being created . Everyone was on a high-tech surfboard . It was a lot of fun . " <P> Today the double whammy of a lingering U.S. recession and a maturing of high-tech industries has made life in Silicon Valley considerably less buoyant . Employment , profits and housing prices are down , traffic congestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looms overhead . " The vision we 've had about this place has changed , " says Stone . " Economically , we 're a region at risk . " In what is probably the ultimate indignity , some residents say the area is becoming like Los Angeles . " The Valley , " notes Thomas Mandel , a futurist for the consulting firm SRI , " is going through a mid-life crisis . " <P> Nothing provides a better testament to the past decade 's growth binge than the headlong rise and subsequent stalling of home prices in Santa Clara County . From March 1985 to March 1990 , the median price of homes zoomed from $125,000 to $235,000 . Real estate appreciation ran at 3% a month , and most listings attracted multiple offers within 72 hours . Today 8,700 homes ( median price : $226,500 ) languish on the market . " In Santa Clara County , it 's a sacred thing : property values go up , " says San Jose Realtor John Pinto , a Brooklyn native who came to the Valley believing it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wave at the lone pedestrian he can see through one of his plate-glass windows facing a main street . Though it is rush hour , the boulevard is eerily quiet . " This is as bad as it 's been , " says Pinto . <P> The Valley has gone through slumps before . Recession buffeted the region in 1981-82 , but the explosive growth of personal computing brought the ailing industry charging back . In 1985 foreign competition , mostly from Japan , made serious inroads into the semiconductor market . From late 1984 to early 1986 , the region lost nearly 33,000 jobs , or 4% of the work force . Just a year later , those jobs and more were reclaimed when a surge of new products and an infusion of venture capital helped rekindle the region 's growth . Regis McKenna , Silicon Valley 's pre-eminent marketing consultant , says he has seen half a dozen recessions in his 31 years in the Valley . " Every three years we go through these cyclical changes , " he says . " In the course of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an end . "
