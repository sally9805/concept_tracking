<p> At least twice in the past few weeks , NATO helicopters have taken off after nightfall , circled once or twice over this small city in the Balkans and dropped a payload of political propaganda on the sleepy populace below . <p> The propaganda , in the form of white-and-blue leaflets , is laced with grammatical errors and tainted by association with its distributors , according to critics . Despite the imperfections , it 's the latest weapon to be deployed in the bitter battle for hearts and minds between rival factions in the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia . <p> The leaflets leave no doubt that the rich Western powers , which are spending $ 1 billion annually to rebuild this country , support Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic , though they do not mention her by name . They make clear the West opposes the clique around Plavsic 's arch-rival for power , Bosnian Serb ex-president Radovan Karadzic , and will block the Bosnian Serbs from receiving aid money so long as these " selfish individuals " continue to wield influence . <p> Bijeljina is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's no coincidence that the NATO choppers have chosen to target it along with one or two others . <p> The city is controlled by Karadzic and his hard-line allies , and no place is more important to them . It 's the only city in Bosnian Serb territory with anything approaching bustling commerce , nearly all of it fueled by smuggled cigarettes , gasoline and building materials . As the main conduit over the Drina River between Yugoslavia and the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia , it 's the key choke point for the millions of dollars ' worth of contraband  --  and profits  --  that keep Karadzic &; Co. in business . <p> For that reason , Plavsic and her Western backers covet Bijeljina , a low-rise city of about 95,000 residents with modest houses , anonymous apartment blocks and a crowded downtown market area . " Take Bijeljina , and the rest of Karadzic 's empire is a house of cards , " said a Western diplomat in Bosnia . " He would n't last long . " <p> But with elections for a new Bosnian Serb parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb of forces loyal to Karadzic , an indicted war crimes suspect , whom Washington and its European allies accuse of obstructing the U.S.-mediated peace process for Bosnia . Plavsic , although herself a rigid nationalist who supported " ethnic cleansing " during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia , has attacked the corruption of Karadzic and is seen as somewhat more supportive of Western peace efforts . <p> The Karadzic clique , based in the ski resort town of Pale , a three-hour drive south , controls much of Bijeljina 's local government . It controls the Serb Republic 's Internal Affairs Ministry and retains influence in the headquarters of the Bosnian Serb army , both of which are based here . Most important , it controls the city 's police force , the chief enforcers in Balkan politics . <p> For those who step out of line and defy Pale  --  and there have been a handful of such cases in the last few months  --  retribution in the form of job loss , threats and harassment is swift . When a ranking local politician , Dusice Bracanovic , defected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ago , she was beaten up in public by two men in police uniforms , according to human rights monitors . <p> " We 've been through three months of hell , " said Jovan Krsmanovic , another functionary who switched parties and sided with Plavsic in July . He said he has received anonymous phone calls telling him he would n't " live to see next Friday . " Lately , said Krsmanovic , the hard-liners who control city hall have been trying to evict Plavsic 's people from their new party headquarters downtown , saying the building must be torn down for reasons of " urban planning . " <p> If Plavsic tries to wrest Bijeljina from Karadzic 's grasp , " you would have real fighting here , " said Sasa Pazarac , who represents the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights here . " It 'd be hard for anyone to take power in a peaceful way . " <p> For a time last summer , it appeared the West was prepared to use more force on Plavsic 's behalf . Troops of the NATO-led Stabilization Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banja Luka , the largest city in Bosnian Serb territory and the headquarters for Plavsic . British soldiers also arrested one Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect and shot another who resisted arrest . <p> But a similar operation Aug. 28 in the strategic northern town of Brcko failed when crowds of stone-throwing Serbs clashed with American troops . The NATO force backed down , with U.S. troops in particular adopting a lower profile . In a place where force alone is respected , the West again was seen as wavering , and Karadzic was back in business . <p> Now , authority in the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia , a crescent-shaped territory of fewer than 1 million people , is starkly divided between Plavsic 's west and Karadzic 's east  --  both of them weak . In effect , the territory is split into parallel police forces , parallel information networks and parallel capitals . <p> Although NATO landed a blow against Pale by shutting down its snarlingly anti-Western television broadcasts earlier this month , the dividends for Plavsic so far seem modest . Although she is receiving several million dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is too weak to fire key officials who are close to the hard-line leadership in Pale . <p> Meanwhile , Karadzic and his stalwarts still control most banking , postal , tax and telephone operations on Bosnian Serb territory , as well as much of what meager employment there is . And they continue to enrich themselves by taking a cut on practically all goods trucked across their domain , according to Western diplomats and local journalists in Bosnia . <p> The result is a stalemate , with some here wondering if Washington and its Western allies are n't content to have the two Bosnian Serb factions at each other 's throats and therefore less of a threat to their neighbors . <p> A placid place before the 1992-95 war in Bosnia , Bijeljina was among the first cities where " ethnic cleansing " took its toll . Soon after the fighting began , Muslims , who represented more than a third of the city 's population , were violently driven from their homes by Serb fighters calling themselves the Panthers . <p> The notorious commander of the Panthers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , is among those in Bijeljina who broke with Pale and joined Plavsic . But these days his people are disheartened and do not put much stock in Plavsic 's chances in the parliamentary elections scheduled for next month . <p> " All funds , legal and illegal , are still controlled by Pale , " said Gavril Antonic , secretary of Savic 's party . " If Mrs. Plavsic does n't solve that problem , she 'll lose even what she 's gained up until now . " <p> Plavsic called the elections this summer when she dissolved the previous Bosnian Serb parliament loyal to Karadzic . After balking for two months , Pale 's hard-liners agreed to the parliamentary elections in November if Plavsic would submit herself to a new presidential election in December . In a deal brokered by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic , she accepted in September . <p> But the State Department , worried that Plavsic might lose the presidency and scuttle Washington 's policy , immediately objected to holding two elections in such quick succession . <p> Now , as preparations continue for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual Bosnian muddle , with Pale threatening to boycott the polls unless the presidential election is revived and its television broadcasts allowed to resume . About 150 parties , coalitions and independent candidates are likely to appear on the parliamentary ballots . <p> Lacking police control of half the Bosnian Serb territory , Plavsic is unlikely to gain much through the ballot box , according to her allies here . <p> " Her image is kind of melting , " said Antonic.
