" Boycott Folgers coffee . What it brews is misery and death . " Narrated by actor Ed Asner , that TV attack ad has sparked a battle between a San Francisco-based peace group called Neighbor to Neighbor and corporate giant Procter &; Gamble , whose Folgers brand is the top-selling U.S. coffee . The 30- sec. spot , which aired earlier this month on CBS affiliate WHDH in Boston , accuses Procter &; Gamble of prolonging the ten-year civil war in El Salvador by buying Salvadoran coffee beans , the country 's leading export , and thereby supporting the right-wing government of President Alfredo Cristiani . <P> For Procter &; Gamble , the charges have been too bitter to swallow . In an angry response , the Cincinnati-based consumer products firm yanked its advertising , worth as much as $1 million a year , from the Boston station . " We felt very strongly that our integrity was being attacked , and we could not let that go unchallenged , " said Don Tassone , a P &G; spokesman . He noted that Folgers contains less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important to us , we are supported by our Government 's policy , " Tassone said . In a recent letter to the company , Under Secretary of State Robert Kimmitt urged P &G; to continue buying Salvadoran coffee to promote economic stability in the impoverished country . <P> Such support is anathema to Neighbor to Neighbor , which opposes U.S. policy in El Salvador . The protest group , with a national membership of 52,000 , argues that El Salvador 's $400 million worth of annual coffee exports mainly benefits a handful of wealthy families and helps finance death squads and military atrocities against civilians . " There 's blood on that coffee , " says Fred Ross , the group 's director . " Action by corporations like Procter &; Gamble could send economic shock waves into El Salvador and force a negotiated settlement to the war . " <P> For now , at least , that message will continue to be heard . In Worcester , Mass. , independent station WHLL plans to run the Neighbor to Neighbor spot this week . Says Michael Volpe , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to do with First Amendment rights than with coffee and advertising . If you take away the right to run an ad , you 're losing something . " <P> In Washington , Congress could debate a boycott of its own this week , when the House is expected to vote on a measure to speed up the Salvadoran peace process . The bill would cut in half this year 's $85 million of scheduled military aid to El Salvador if the Cristiani government appears to be stalling in talks to end the war with the country 's leftist guerrillas . <P> Ironically any campaign to change American coffee habits would probably be overshadowed by last year 's drop in coffee prices . Salvadoran coffee beans that sold for $135 per 100 lbs . last summer fetch just $70 , a plunge that has slashed the country 's export earnings by at least $175 million , or about 30% . Says Ernesto Altschul , a senior adviser to Cristiani : " I ca n't imagine they can hurt our coffee industry any worse . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
