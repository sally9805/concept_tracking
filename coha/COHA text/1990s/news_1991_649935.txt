<p> Since the war in Indochina , the reluctance of some Americans to commit U.S. troops to foreign wars has been derided as the " Vietnam syndrome . " But the most persistent hangover from that lost war appears to be the conservative and military myth that restraints imposed at home made victory in Vietnam impossible . <p> As Vice President Quayle put it recently : " Operation Desert Storm will not be another Vietnam . U.S. forces will not be asked to fight with one arm tied behind their backs . " <p> Gen. William C. Westmoreland , who commanded U.S. forces in Vietnam , was more explicit : " Because President Johnson was afraid of bringing in China and starting a world war , we were n't allowed to enlarge the battlefield , " the old general told Fox Butterfield of The New York Times . <p> He added that the current U.S. air attack on Iraq was likely to be more effective than was the bombing of North Vietnam because then President Johnson " selected the targets to be hit " instead of giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does allow the military in the field more latitude in Iraq than Lyndon Johnson permitted in Vietnam . It misleads the American people , however , and insults history to suggest that U.S. forces in Vietnam had " one hand tied behind their backs " and were not allowed to win the war . <p> Does this mean they could n't use nuclear weapons ? Neither , so far as we know , can the forces in the Persian Gulf . Nor should they . <p> Does it mean that a second-rate Army of " societal scum " went to Vietnam ? An article in The Wall Street Journal by Richard Kolb , editor of the Veterans of Foreign Wars magazine , debunks that canard : 75 percent of those who fought in Vietnam and 73 percent of those who died in combat were volunteers ; 79 percent were high school graduates ; 97 percent were honorably discharged . <p> Does the charge mean that the Vietnam Army was not well supplied or given the latest and best equipment ? No one who ever saw such impressive U.S. supply bases as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make such a charge . <p> As for his argument that Johnson feared bringing on a war with China , and possibly a world war , indeed he did . And why should he not have ? Having in mind the example of Chinese entry into the Korean war , barely a decade earlier , Johnson exercised the same proper Presidential caution that President Eisenhower did in refusing to enter the Indochina war in 1954  --  caution that Americans of their time demanded of both Presidents . Later research may show that there was little likelihood of Chinese intervention in Vietnam ; but Johnson could not be sure of that at the time . If anything , his caution suggests the problems of fighting in regions and among people of whom we know little . But can it be said that we know much more today about the Middle East than we knew about Indochina in the 1960 's ? <p> Johnson was restrictive in the targeting he permitted . But that did not lose the war ; far more bombs were dropped on the two Vietnams , Laos and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when President Nixon ordered the " Christmas bombing " of Hanoi in 1972 , ample research shows that it was not really to drive the North Vietnamese into negotiation ; it was instead to persuade the South Vietnamese that they could afford to accept a settlement already tentatively worked out . <p> The argument that U.S. forces were not allowed " to expand the battlefield " is simply false . They invaded Cambodia , arguably bringing about the Khmer Rouge triumph in that tragic nation , and they provided tremendous logistical and other support for the disastrous South Vietnamese invasion of Laos . An invasion of North Vietnam would have required huge further investments of lives and money , and run what then were thought to be high risks of war with China and/or the Soviet Union . <p> Another ghost of Vietnam haunts the gulf  --  the tight restraints on the press imposed by the Bush Administration . No such restrictions were seen in Vietnam , and many in the military today have convinced themselves  --  contrary to the evidence  --  that the Indochina war was lost because pessimistic press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To believe that is to believe that the U.S. could have won the war in Vietnam had not the press falsely reported it to be losing . The hard truth , to deny which is only to feed superpatriot fantasies , is that the war was lost because it could not be won  --  not by any military means acceptable to an American public that endured the loss of more than 50,000 lives , untold treasure and its own political innocence .
