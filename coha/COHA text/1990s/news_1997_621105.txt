<p> FOR SAFETY 'S SAKE , REORGANIZE THE MUNI <p> Editor  --  So it takes the National Transportation Safety Board to blow the whistle on Muni for 10 accidents in eight months , injuring 10 people and causing $ 3.6 million in damage  --  and all attributed to negligence . The miracle is that no one of the public has been killed  --  yet . <p> Neither Muni itself nor the state Public Utilities Commission has taken necessary steps to protect the public safety , according to the safety board . Clearly San Franciscans need to take action to reorganize the Muni , for safety sake , to establish an organization with the responsibility and ability to supervise Muni properly . <p> SPUR has just such a plan calling for establishment of a new Municipal Transportation Authority with full responsibility for operating , managing and overseeing public transit in the city . This would replace the current system where no one  --  not the mayor , not the supervisors , not the commissioners , and not the general manager of Muni  --  no matter how well intentioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please . . . before someone is killed . <p> JAMES CHAPPELL <p> President  --  SPUR <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> COMING CATASTROPHE ? <p> Editor  --  Re : " Harsh U.S. Report on Muni Safety " ( Chronicle , September 17 ) . I survived being run over by a bus near the Transbay Terminal at Fremont and Mission streets in 1988 . The driver , who killed three people and injured 13 others , had been rejected by Muni and SamTrans . He eventually passed a short and crude training course by Greyhound and was contracted to steer a SamTrans bus at lower than standard wages  --  saving money for these two bus companies who were liable . <p> Having survived 28 fractures , massive internal bleeding and 15 surgeries , I 'm concerned about the safety standards of Muni . Your article states , " The safety board attributed four of the crashes to unspecified operator error and three to stop sign violations . " " Stop sign violations " are operator error , and so is " inadequate supervision of an operator . " <p> Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores and actual hours behind the wheel  --  been cut back ? Has anyone compared the current standards with those of five or ten years ago ? Or is inadequate funding placing all of us in jeopardy ? <p> Every Bay Area commuter or citizen of San Francisco , in a car , on foot , or on a bus , is at risk . I do n't want to see a repeat of the 1988 catastrophe . <p> MARSHA GENTRY <p> Castro Valley <p> . <p> PARKING CZAR RESPONDS <p> Editor  --  On Monday , The Chronicle ran an article regarding a ticket that had been issued in error to Mr. Jerry English , a school principal in Madera . The ticket issued had a typographical error that caused the department to notify the wrong person . We strive to minimize such errors and will continue to try and eliminate as many as possible . <p> When they do happen , we pledge to correct them as soon as possible and with the least inconvenience to the public . We are working to improve our responsiveness to our customers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own staff are not reflective of this department 's feelings toward the public . That employee has been counseled so that inappropriate comments will not occur again . <p> It is a pleasure to have people like Mr. English who respect the government and expect the government to respect them in return . We will continue with our efforts to improve our public response and to do so without gratuitous comments in the future . <p> BILL MAHER <p> Executive Director <p> San Francisco Department <p> of Parking &; Traffic <p> . <p> FERRY VISIONS <p> Editor  --  Before we blot the BART strike from memory , let 's recognize the superb , responsive , efficient service offered by everyone connected with the Oakland-Alameda ferries . They were quick to adjust schedules and shift boats to add capacity where needed . <p> With one further change , the ferries could become major players in the commute business . That 's the addition of fast-loading ramps , like those used by the Marin boats . Then they could handle 300 to 600 people without taking 15 minutes to unload . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be found . And all commuters would benefit , far into the future . <p> FRED MATTHEWS <p> Oakland <p> . <p> CHILD SUPPORT CONUNDRUM <p> Editor  --  Tuesday 's editorial , " Chasing Deadbeat Dads , " paints a very one-sided picture of the issue of child support . I strongly resent the connotation that nonpayment implies irresponsibility on the father 's part . It is unfortunate that the alliterative qualities of " deadbeat " and " dads " roll so easily together . <p> I am the father of four children , divorced twice  --  once in California  --  and I have always gone beyond my legal obligations in supporting my children . Despite holding a well-paying job , with more than sufficient income to provide adequately for my children , I could easily have ended up as a deadbeat dad . Discretion to provide just and fair sup port awards has been removed from the courts , who are forced to make awards based on a superficial consideration of relative income levels only , without considering the specific circumstances . <p> Such shortsightedness can only create support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windfall , and often place the other party in an impossible financial position . It is easy to see how , with the right knowledge , the system can be manipulated for profit on the one hand , or used with punitive effect on the other . Hardly appropriate for a " no- fault " system ! Nor in the children 's best interest ! <p> Look behind the statistics . In many cases the system has placed excessive and punitive financial support obligations on breadwinners , with no consideration of the need for such obligations , nor the ability to meet these obligations . I know  --  I 've been there . <p> PETER WINDER <p> Corte Madera <p> . <p> MISSING ALUMNI <p> Editor  --  I find it quite interesting that in your " Distinguished Alumni " listing that was part of the Chelsea Clinton at Stanford article of September 16 , you omitted the names of quite a few African-American alumni , some with a Bay Area connection . Specifically : <p> Mae Jemison  --  first African- American woman in space ; <p> Charles Ogletree  --  Harvard professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( September 17 ) Chronicle ; <p> Gene Washington  --  49ers star wide receiver and current NFL executive ; <p> Dominique Dawes  --  star Olympic gymnast and current Stanford student . <p> You list your " names " source as the Stanford Alumni Association , and granted , you can not list everyone , but the above individuals are not exactly " chopped liver , " either ! <p> ROBERT DIXON <p> ( Stanford Class of ' 75 ) <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> MIDDLE CLASS REDEFINED <p> Editor  --  Well , I 'm glad that 's finally cleared up . For a while there , I was actually under the foolish impression that " middle class " had something to do with one 's economic status , only to learn , just recently , from our government , that " middle class " means : Anyone with a dependent child . <p> LOU RIEGEL <p> El Granada <p> . <p> CHRISTMAS IN SEPTEMBER <p> Editor  --  I just saw my first Christmas tree of the season . It 's in the window of the Macy 's store on Market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone I know is disgusted by the ever-earlier onset of Christmas consumerism , but each year businesses insist on trying to squeeze a few more shopping weeks out of us . <p> If you 're as sick as I am of being immersed in the holiday season for four months a year , I suggest you take your Macy 's credit card , cut it up into 12 neat pieces  --  one for each of the 12 days of Christmas  --  and send it back , along with a letter telling them why . <p> DEBORAH UNDERWOOD <p> San Francisco
