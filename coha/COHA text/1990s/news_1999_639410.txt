<p> Six Denver professionals are responsible for a range of decisions that color your world , yet chances are you do n't even know their names . <p> They have a hand in shaping the way you perceive your community , where you invest your money , how you feel about local <p> government , whether you believe your neighborhood is safe , even whether you take a raincoat to work . <p> If you watch local TV news , you feel the subtle effects of their choices every day . <p> Who are the people running Denver 's newsrooms , the ones who decide whether or not to air the Columbine cafeteria footage , how often to replay the JonBenet Ramsey pageant pictures , how much to emphasize local gang activity and how many seconds to give the international headlines ? <p> They are moms and dads , newcomers and third-generation Coloradans , news hounds , adrenalin junkies and corporate climbers : <p> Patti Dennis , who worked her way up at Channel 9 , oversees KUSA 's news department , No.1 in the 10 p.m. race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angie Kucharski , who arrived just before the Columbine tragedy last spring from a much smaller market , manages KCNC 's newsroom , currently No.2 at 10 p.m . <p> Diane Mulligan , formerly of KCNC and MSNBC , runs the revamped KMGH news operation , strengthening the numbers and drawing younger viewers but still No.3 at 10 p.m . <p> Steve Grund , who trained at Juilliard to be an actor , leads KWGN 's expanding news operation , including the soon-to-be-redesigned graphics , set and music for the 9 p.m. newscast . <p> Bill Dallman , the newest addition to the ranks , was hired by KDVR from Grand Rapids , Mich. , to assemble a news staff and launch a 9 p.m. newscast next year . <p> And the only Denver news director for whom the JonBenet Ramsey story was No.2 behind the flooding in Mexico , Rodolfo Cardenas of Univision 's Channel 50 , who is experienced in serving a niche market . <p> These executives regularly are caught between frantic producers trying to put on a show , demanding general managers trying to please advertisers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' research . ' They are criticized for short-term thinking , they are criticized for planning ratings-period ' specials . ' They manufacture journalism on the run , always under pressure of deadline and budget constraints . <p> They are accused of relying on the predictable , yet when they do manage to put a breaking news story on the air , the sales departments and soap-opera fans blast them for interrupting regular programming . <p> KCNC General Manager Marv Rockford , a former news director , has called it a burnout job . <p> Interestingly , Denver is the largest TV market in the country to boast three female news directors at the three major network affiliates - Channels 4 , 7 and 9 . It 's doubtful the women 's presence affects the substance of the newscasts since , by the time they rise to the executive ranks in news , women are every bit as competitive and business-minded as their male colleagues . Still , they do set a different tone in the newsroom . <p> ' How would Columbine have been handled if it was three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said KMGH 's Diane Mulligan . ' News judgment is news judgment . ' Still , she notes , her station , led by a female general manager as well , is ' family-friendly ' in a way it might not be under childless or male managers . <p> Regardless of gender , television news directors must be equal parts Edward R. Murrow and P.T. Barnum , informing and entertaining in a high-profile juggling act . They must respect viewers as informed citizens , while enticing them as typical consumers . <p> They may dream of doing capital-J journalism , but they live and die by stories on the weather and the Broncos . <p> ' It 's about meshing informative stories and those stories people are most interested in , stories that will bring them to the newscast , ' according to KMGH 's Mulligan . <p> Most news directors last two or three years . Many are hired for the wrong reasons : A newsperson with great editorial skills is n't necessarily a good motivator and manager . <p> ' You get into this business because you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' says KCNC 's Kucharski . ' Then you 're elevated without a whole lot of management training . ' Beyond approving scripts , budgeting and public relations , they have to remember to bring the vans in for maintenance and keep the troops fed . <p> ' News directors have to be psychiatrists , lawyers , accountants , strategic planners , ' says KWGN 's Grund , the longest-tenured news director in town . It 's about being mentor , coach , teacher and cheerleader . <p> ' It 's also a very lonely position , ' Grund says . <p> What about Fox ? <p> The current question in Denver news circles : What will a Fox newscast look like when it debuts at 9 p.m. next summer ? <p> When KDVR-Channel 31 occupies its new building at Speer Boulevard and Lincoln Street near Downtown Denver , it will be at the heart of broadcast row . With the exception of Channel 2 , whose facility is in Englewood , Denver 's TV stations are all within a few blocks of each other , giving a physical presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest now that Fox 's Channel 31 has named a news director and is preparing to assemble a staff in advance of joining the nightly fray . Each local TV newsroom is girding for a new level of competition . <p> Channel 31 's Dallman wo n't try to import a format just because it worked elsewhere , he says . <p> ' You have to find out what people want and need first . I plan on doing a lot of listening . ' Local anchors and reporters as well as former Denver broadcasters wishing to return to Colorado see Channel 31 's startup as promising . <p> Tom Martino , Les Shapiro , Ron Zappolo ? Do any of these players - gone or soon to be free from local contracts - have a future with Fox ? <p> ' I know the names , ' Dallman said . It 's too soon to talk about staffing , he demurred . Still , he has the budget to bring in some heavyweights . In his last market , he said , his goal was to find ' a diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of the best . ' <p> Dallman takes a practical approach to TV news . In Sacramento four years ago , where he was executive producer , his ABC station went commercial-free for 54 hours on a flood story as authorities evacuated three counties . <p> ' It was what TV does best , ' he said , delivering ' incredible pictures ' of folks being rescued out of trees , and ' warning people at the second it 's happening ' about real danger . <p> ' I felt we were at the height of what we are supposed to be doing . ' <p> Expertise plus youth <p> What should Dallman be doing now that he belongs to the network that capitalizes on ' When Animals Attack ' ? How much of the renowned Fox style should Denver viewers expect ? Dallman promises the newscast will be ' journalistically sound , ' and expects the news staff to represent ' a mix of expertise and youth and vitality . ' <p> ' Their challenge will be to identify their niche , ' observes Channel 4 's Kucharski . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . ' <p> Channel 2 's Grund predicts , ' Whatever style they use , to compete they 've got to do good work . I do n't think they 'll take enormous risks . ' <p> 32 new hires <p> As Dallman 's direct competitor , Grund will hire 32 new people , including five on-air , to launch a morning show intended to be ' open , improvisational , fun , with a Colorado crisp feel . ' His goal this year was to strengthen the nightly Ernie Bjorkman-Wendy Brockman newscast . Having succeeded in terms of critical assessments and the Nielsens , he said , ' it 's time now to be more competitive across all time periods . I 'm not looking to react to Fox . I 'm looking to become a stronger television station . ' With a full staff in place all day , KWGN presumably wo n't be caught short in the event of a major breaking story like Columbine . <p> Grund offers a historic overview to explain why independent stations like Channel 2 and Channel 31 - former homes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in local news battles . <p> ' We have had to reinvent ourselves , ' Grund says . ' When movies , sports and kids ' programming went to cable , ( independents ) were left with reruns . ' They 're redefining themselves as local news sources . <p> Prevalent paradox <p> Denver is like most markets when it comes to a basic paradox about local TV news : It 's popular even though it 's less than brilliant . Surveys indicate TV news is the most trusted news source in the country ; critics complain that local TV news is the worst sort of journalism in the American news business . <p> Locally and nationally , viewers are less and less committed to the nightly TV news habit . Still , news is a profit center for local stations . <p> Perhaps the worst failure in Denver TV news , KMGH 's ' Real Life , Real News , ' was unplugged in 1998 by Cindy Velasquez when she took over as general manager . That failed attempt at a tabloid-style newscast emphasized disjointed clips of natural disasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the picture is improved , particularly at Channel 7 . Velasquez hired the well-regarded Mulligan to make news a priority again and get Channel 7 back in the game . Through personnel changes , notably Marty Coniglio on weather and Tom Green on sports , higher technical standards and a better , more relevant brand of journalism , the station is making progress . The goal now is consistency over time . <p> ' The biggest word is trust , ' Mulligan says . ' It 's what Ed Sardella has going for him . ' That 's her aim , ' every show , every minute , night after night . ' <p> Of course , Sardella 's planned retirement in early summer is just one factor in the game to come . <p> All eyes will be on Fox 's local news debut to see how stylized or , perhaps , how conventional the product is . Newcomer Dallman previously revamped the ABC affiliate 's No.3 newscast in Grand Rapids and took it to No.1 to beat the longtime-winning NBC affiliate . Yet he knows there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. , and Denver , the 18th largest . <p> ' He has a very difficult job . How do you ' Fox-ify ' Denver news , especially after Columbine ? ' asks Channel 7 's Mulligan . ' I would n't want to be in his shoes . ' <p> The startup is a daunting task , yet ' if you do it right you can really make a name for yourself in this industry , ' says Channel 9 's Dennis . <p> Will Dallman opt for noisy graphics , edgy story selection , young-skewing topics and attention-grabbing music ? <p> ' People in Denver make quality decisions when it comes to community standards , ' Dallman said . <p> In other words , it 's too soon to tell . <p> Angie Kucharski , Channel 4-KCNC <p> Seven months ( she started two weeks before Columbine ) <p> WBNS Columbus , Ohio <p> She survived a trial by fire , and was good at listening to veteran staffers during the Columbine tragedy in her first weeks on the job . She 's known for trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally , providing ice cream on Fridays and bumping navels with underlings . <p> Perk up a sleepy newscast , boost morale , replace high-profile personalities who have left ( Tom Martino , Les Shapiro ) and draw in younger viewers . <p> Diane Mulligan , Channel 7 KMGH <p> 11/2 years <p> KMGH , NBC News , KCNC <p> What they say : Knowledgeable and incredibly dedicated , often showing up in the field on big stories , she 's respected inside and outside Channel 7 . <p> Changing viewers ' entrenched habits , and re-establishing the station as a news source after years of forfeiting the game under previous managers . <p> Patti Dennis , Channel 9-KUSA <p> 3 years <p> KUSA , 18 years with Gannett <p> She drives herself hard , often calling the shots as editor and director on breaking news . She is known for voicing her disapproval to staff , yet she 's also unwavering in support of new hires . <p> Avoiding complacency as ratings leader while presiding over the highest-rated bedtime newscast in the country . She also must improve station morale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ie. inexpensive ) . What happens this summer when Ed Sardella retires and Ron Zapollo 's contract expires ? <p> Steve Grund , Channel 2-KWGN <p> 12 years , the last six with added responsibility for Tribune 's 17 news outlets . <p> An energetic boss with an eye toward new media , he 's also at times distracted by corporate duties that take him out of town . But the station is doing more news cut-ins , hiring news staff and ramping up for a morning show , 6-9 a.m. , starting in January . <p> For years the market 's sole source of news at 9 p.m. , it now must compete with a newcomer . He 's doubling the news budget to launch a three-hour morning show , ' Good Morning Colorado , ' in January . <p> Bill Dallman , Channel 31-KDVR <p> One month <p> He 's a smart guy , an up-and-comer , in a plum job . <p> Building a staff of 60-65 people , launching a news product and doiung it all under a microscope in a very competitive market . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . The 9 p.m. newscast is due by summer ; how soon thereafter can Dallman get a morning show going ? <p> Rodolfo Cardenas , Channel 50-Univision <p> Five years ; previously with the competition , Telemundo . <p> Cardenas was the first Hispanic immigrant ( from Venezuela ) to be an anchor and news director in Colorado . He launched the Spanish-language station 's news department . <p> Keeping pace with the growing Hispanic population that now makes up 14 percent of the Denver-Boulder market . The newscast will get a facelift next year with a new newsroom and more personnel hired to boost the five-person staff .
