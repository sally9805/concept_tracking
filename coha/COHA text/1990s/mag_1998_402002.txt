Lenny Klein was old enough to be my father . But he seduced me with money , power , and adoration . Here 's how I nearly lost myself in his destructive love-until tragedy brought me to my senses . // Lenny Klein 's stepdaughter , Jess , and I met on our first day at Sarah Lawrence College . Jess had swingy brown hair cut into a pageboy and an intelligent face . She was my physical opposite : dark , mysterious . She came up to me and introduced herself She was cool , her voice lilting and musical . I developed an instant crush on her . Lenny would remind me later that he introduced himself to me that first day . If you had told me back then that in the not-too  --  distant future I would be walking down a Paris boulevard with Jess 's stepfather , that I would be lying in bed with him in a Cannes hotel room , that he would lean back in the chairs of haute couture salons , puffing on a cigar and choosing dresses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was old enough to be my father , that there was no way . Stealth Seduction The first time Lenny Klein asked me out , during my freshman fall semester , I convinced myself that all he wanted was to plan a surprise party for Jess 's birthday He took me to The River Cafe in Brooklyn . It was n't until we were halfway there , driving downtown in Lenny 's Rolls-Royce , that I allowed myself the thought that I was actually on a date with Jess 's stepfather . At the restaurant , Lenny handed the maitre d ' a folded $20 bill and we were led to a window table . " Did you see that " Lenny asked me . " See what ? " " The way you turned every head in the place . Do n't tell me you do n't know your own effect . Do you know what I told Jess the first time I met you " he asked huskily . " I said you were a golden girl . An angel . " I flushed as a waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the wine list , sir ? " " Do you have a ' 58 Margaux " " I 'm sorry , sir , we have only the ' 61 . " " Very well , then . " Lenny leaned back in his seat and smirked at me . " This wine we 're about to drink is older than you are , " he said . I knew that I would be sunk if I did n't say something-and soon-about Jess or about his wife . But I felt paralyzed , and beneath that paralysis , there was a frisson of excitement , an awareness of doing absolutely the wrong thing . Lenny lifted his glass in my direction . " To beauty , " he said . I flushed more deeply and looked out the window . I had an inkling of how much this excited Lenny : young girl , old wine . It was the first time in my life I felt my youth as power . After Muscovy duck , after creme brulee and cognac , he leaned across the table and ran his finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual . " I 'll drive you home , " he said with a wink . I sat all the way against the passenger door as he drove me back to school , my cheek hot against the cool window . I felt sick to mv stomach . On a long , straight stretch of road , Lenny reached down slowly and deliberately moved my long skirt up my thigh and squeezed my knee . I knew I should tell him I could n't ever see him again , but it already seemed too late . Reckless Romance Lenny sent flowers every day after that evening , a lost-looking delivery van pulling up outside my dorm for the world to see  --  how did he have the nerve ? I kept throwing the flowers away , but they kept coming . So when Lenny showed up outside my dorm and sat there in his car until I came out on my way to the library , I panicked . " What if Jess sees you ? " I asked . " Jess knows , " he said quietly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We drove upstate . What I remember is in fragments : the way the wind whistled through my ears in the convertible , ajar of strawberry preserves he insisted on buying me at a country cafe . He never stopped telling me how beautiful I was , how special , how he thought from the moment he first saw me that I was the most perfect creature he had ever laid eyes on . He told me how much I reminded him of an old girlfriend of his , the actress Jacqueline Bisset . His words had a narcotic effect . And when he pulled the car to the side of the road after lunch and kissed me , his tongue pushing deeply , immediately , into my mouth , at first I felt sick , but then I began to float away . I put my hand on the nape of his neck and felt a strange edge there , apiece of hairweave , stiff as carpet . You 've done it now , I thought to myself . Somehow it seemed impossible to go back , to stop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship and honesty did not exist . It seemed to me , at the age of 20 , that I had already ruined myself . When I got back to my dorm that day , there was a folded note pinned to my door , written in the bold , black strokes of Jess 's fountain pen : Meet me at the pub at seven . It was nearly seven . I walked to the pub . Through the window , I could see Jess at our usual corner table . I tried to read her face , but she seemed purposely blank . " Hi , " I said softly , sitting across from her . She just looked at me , her usual smile playing around the corners of her mouth . I felt like sliding through the floor . " Say something , " I pleaded . " Anything . " She shook her head slowly . " I 'm so som ; " I said . " I never meant for this to happen . I met with him because I thought he wanted to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Her voice was uncharacteristically shrill , the only thing that gave her away . " Today , " I answered , " I kissed him . " She pushed back her chair from the table , and I was afraid she was going to leave . " less , he disgusted me , " I said quickly . " I was completely grossed out . " " Really , " she said , that amused glint returning to her eyes . " I swear to you , it wo n't happen again . " Drunken Surrender I kept my word and Jess allowed me back into her life . She even invited me to her 21st-birthday party . " Lenny wo n't be there , " she told me . " He 'll be awav on business . " But he was there . I got drunker that night than I ever had before . I kept circling the room , staying at a distance from Lenny . I knew he was staring at me , but I would n't look back . I drifted in and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about was Jess . Clearly , she had known Lenny would be here all along . I felt like a pawn in some elaborate game . Lenny announced to the crowd , just before midnight , " If you 'll all follow me , I have something to show you . " We moved outside to the stables that had been converted into a four-car garage . With a flourish , Lenny opened the nearest door . A shiny Alfa Romeo was parked inside . " For the incomparable Jessica , on her 21st birthday , " he announced Jess clapped her hands and laughed with delight . Lenny caught up with me as everyone trooped back into the house . His wife was walking just ahead of us , in a group . She was even more beautiful than Jess and seemed , at 40 , young and glamorous . He bent down and whispered in my ear . " What do you have on under that dress ? " I felt my legs wobble , a wave of heat . In my drunken state , Lenny was suddenly appealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfa Romeos , a benign patriarch . " If you call me , I will call you back , " I said . In the dark of the night , I saw his eyes shining and a flash of white teeth . " Well now , that 's good news , " he replied . Tragic Turning Point For nearly four years , I was Lenny Klein 's mistress . I dropped out of college . I lived in the apartments he rented for me , I wore the clothing and jewels he bought me , and I believed his lies : that he and his wife did n't sleep in the same bed , that she was undergoing electroshock treatment , that his youngest daughter had leukemia  --  all the reasons that he could n't leave his wife and marry me . I dabbled in acting and modeling , I dabbled in drugs , and I drank-a lot . It took the death of my father and the near-death of my mother in a car accident to jolt me out of my stupor and another few months to get Lenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I quit drinking , went back to school , began to piece my life back together . Now , four years after Jess 's 21st birthday party-when Lenny Klein has been reduced to a colorful , if long and painful , story in my mind-I am walking up Madison Avenue when I see her . I almost do n't recognize her . She 's a grown-up : suit , heels , briefcase . By the time I realize it 's Jess , it 's too late to avoid her . I lower my eyes and hold my breath as we pass each other , and suddenly , I feel a hand grabbing my arm and shoving me hard into a mailbox . I whip my head around and stare at her , stunned . Passersby slow down and watch , but Jess walks away . " Whore , " she tosses over her shoulder . I head home in a daze , hating myself , the word whore ringing in my ears . When I get to my apartment , the phone rings . She does n't identify herself when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken since her birthday party . " You 're through with him , are n't you " " For a long time now , " I answer . " I could tell when I saw you on the street . You looked healthy . Beautiful . " Her lilting voice is as familiar as if we 've suddenly slipped back to our college days . " Why did you set me up like that at your party " I ask . " What started that night came close to ruining my life . " " I had my reasons , " she answers slowly . " I never meant to hurt you , " I say . And for a moment I imagine that all things , even terrible , twisted things , can somehow be healed . " Listen , can I see you ? " " I do n't think so , " she says gently . " You 've gotten rid of him . Be grateful . He 's married to my mother , and he 's the father of my little sisters . I 'll never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p>
