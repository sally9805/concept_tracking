Thomas Jefferson carved the cornerstone of democracy . He also shaped our culinary heritage as one of America 's first epicures . Photograph Photograph // He lived his life with incredible passion , rising with the sun to add precious minutes to his day , retiring each night only after penning his thoughts in a worn leatherbound journal . Scholar , innovator , gardener , statesman , philosopher , musician , and architect , Thomas Jefferson was also the father of the American gastronomic revolution . It was Jefferson 's curious spirit and adventurous palate that allowed American cuisine to veer from its rather bland English beginnings . As minister to France from 1785 to 1789 , Jefferson discovered food previously unknown to him . James Hemings , a slave at Monticello from 1774 , accompanied him to France for the specific purpose of studying French cooking . When he returned to Virginia , Jefferson took great joy in introducing his food discoveries in the colonies , particularly in his own garden at Monticello . Just as it was by the early 1800s , Thomas Jefferson 's vegetable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three football fields . Visitors accustomed to truck-ripened supermarket produce often comment that the vegetables and fruits in Monticello 's gardens look like real food from bygone days : Tightly cupped " Tennis Ball " lettuce ( one of Jefferson 's favorites ) ; Costoluto Genovese tomatoes , with ripples and valleys creasing their not-so-perfectlyround skins ; and herbs that grow into thick miniature forests , garnishing the estate with their heady aromas . Photograph Photograph Photograph Photograph // In muffled morning sunlight , we are walking along the grassy border that hems the lush vegetable garden . Prince Albert peas climb dried fruit branch stakes , their errant tendrils curling in the air , their tiny pods dangling from five-pointed caps . Huge artichoke leaves spread over the cinnamon-colored clay like the gray-green wings of prehistoric birds . Tansy-used in pudding and for medicinal purposes in Jefferson 's time-spills a soapy aroma through the garden , while a carpet of Roman chamomile wafts a bubblegum scent as we pass . At the end of the garden , &foot; hollyhocks-white , pale pink , maroon , and yellow-brilliantly spike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a walk through their ruffly blooms makes you feel as though you 've stepped into the pages of a children 's book . " Jefferson 's garden was a laboratory , " says Monticello 's Director of Gardens and Grounds , Peter J. Hatch , as we stroll by a row of crinkled savoy cabbage heads the size of beach balls . " He was not a garden wizard , but an experimenter with unbounding optimism . " Indeed , Jefferson grew 250 varieties of more than 70 different species of vegetables , including 23 varieties of English peas-his favorite vegetable . Jefferson diligently recorded the garden 's progress each day , and the simple yet humbling word " Fail " appears frequently in his notebook . In 1809 he wrote that his yellow squash " came to nothing , " and his Hotspur peas were " killed by frost Oct. 23 . " Yet , ever the idealist , Jefferson believed " the failure of one thing is repaired by the success of another . " The table was bountiful and bold when Jefferson played host at Monticello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . During the nearly 60 years he lived on his Virginia hilltop , his stately brick mansion was open to all who wished to visitneighbors , family , friends , farmers , statesmen . The dinner bell rang at four o'clock ; Jefferson retired by nine . America 's forefathers gathered at Jefferson 's table , as did travelers who often stopped in unannounced . Recalled Monticello overseer , Edmund Bacon : " Visitors came in gangs and they mostly ate him out of house and home . I have killed a fine beef and it would all be eaten in a day or two . There was no tavern in all that country that had so much company . " Nor was anyone serving such a variety of food . In Italy , Jefferson first tasted macaroni . Shortly thereafter , he sent his private secretary , William Short , to Naples to buy a " Maccaroni mould " sic . In Holland , he enjoyed his first waffle and promptly bought a waffle iron . In France , Jefferson discovered delicate sauces and rich desserts . Soon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchovies , and Dijon mustard . He brought vinegar , raisins , almonds , pistachios , figs , and vanilla to us too . His commitment to diversifying American cuisine at times proved perilous : In 1787 Jefferson risked the death penalty in Italy by smuggling out a pocketful of rice . " He practiced industrial espionage , " smiles food historian Leni Ashmore Sorensen . " Luckily , our Customs practices were rudimentary then . " Lucky , to be sure . Jefferson 's keen interest in grains contributed greatly to the success of rice growing in the South . " We owe Jefferson a great deal of thanks for his interest in European foods and wines , " says noted Southern chef and author Edna Lewis . " He added new dimensions to the flavors of the South . " Some guests enjoyed what might then have been called America 's first nouvelle cuisine . Daniel Webster described the meals presented by the Monticello kitchen as " a sophisticated cuisine , served in half Virginian style , half French style , in good taste and abundance . " Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson came home from France so Frenchified that he abjured his native victuals . " For numerous favorite dishes-from pasta to ice cream-Southerners today stand indebted to Jefferson for " rejecting his native foods . " When the Rev. Manasseh Cutler dined with Jefferson in 1802 , a strange dish of noodles befuddled him . In his journal , Reverend Cutler wrote : " Dined at the President's. . . a pie called macaroni , which appeared to be a rich crust filled with the strillions of onions , or shallots , which I took it to be , tasted very strong , and not agreeable . Mr. Meriwether Lewis told me there were none in it ; it was an Italian dish , and what appeared like onions was made of flour and butter , with a particularly strong liquor mixed with them . " ( Jefferson 's recipe for macaroni , in fact , has no liquor in it . ) After another dinner at the White House in 1803 , Samuel Lathem Mitchell wrote of a new dessert : " The party was easy and sociable , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creams were produced in the form of balls of frozen material inclosed sic in covers of warm pastry , exhibiting a curious contrast , as if the ice had just been taken from the oven . " As much as he enjoyed hosting lavish repasts , Jefferson never lost his love of simple food . He liked greens , corn on the cob , and sweet potatoes . As President , he brought a loyal cook from Monticello to Washington to make his favorite batter cakes , fried apples , and hot breads for breakfast . On his retirement to Monticello in 1809 , Jefferson credited two African American slaves , Edith Fossett and a young woman known only as Fanny , with bringing him the best tastes of both continents , transforming what he called Monticello 's " plantation fare " into " choice " meals . It is said that Jefferson himself never went into the kitchen , except to wind the clock . Today in that kitchen , herbs hang on drying pegs just as they did 200 years ago , and two brick ovens are built into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the South Terrace , the kitchen is some distance from the main house , which made transporting food urgent business for Jefferson 's servants . Heading the staff was the slave who accompanied Jefferson to France , his now-fluent-in-French chef , James Hemings . Photograph Photograph // In Monticello 's kitchen , you can almost hear the clatter of heavy French copper pots and pans , the scurry of footsteps on the underground stone walkway to the main house . Jefferson demanded privacy in his dining room and used an elaborate system of dumbwaiters and a revolving door to ensure that he and his guests would be uninterrupted by his butlers . Jefferson served wine only after dinner-cider and malt liquors were the drinks at table . As usual , Jefferson kept detailed notes on his expenditures , recording that he always needed to keep more champagne in the Presidential cellar when Congress was in session . His yearly wine costs approached $3,000 ( about $30,000 today ) , money he was obliged to take from his own pocket . In Washington , he frequently spent $50 on a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in Virginia attributed such graciousness to his " Southern hospitality . " Jefferson tried to grow the classic European grape , Vitis vinifera , at Monticello , but achieved only moderate success . Thomas Pinney , author of A History of Wine in America , wrote of Jefferson 's frustrated attempts at grape growing , but praised his tireless efforts . " He cared much that others should succeed , " wrote Pinney , " and , by virtue of his zeal and his eminence , can be called the greatest patron of wine and winegrowing that this country has yet had . " From Thomas Jefferson 's Garden Pavilion , you 'll see a sweeping vista to the southeast of the Albemarle County valley . It has been called his " sea view " because of the rolling green waves that unfold below , just beyond the grapevines . Bold , dark pines curl the landscape , and far clouds hang like pale organza veils . Every day , Jefferson looked out upon the diminishing rows of trees-nectarine , apricot , sour cherry , tulip poplar , oak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you squint , the valley 's treetops blur and , yes , the sea is there . The morning sun breaks the darkness like a yolk in a skillet . Dreams fill your head the moment you pass beneath the Pavilion 's arched doorway . And how Mr. Jefferson dreamed . It is a balmy spring evening . We leave Monticello , walking down a curved path fringed with tulips and Virginia bluebells . For a moment we are back in the late 18th century , and we turn hopefully for a last glimpse of our fascinating host . He is not at the door . A candle flickers softly in the study . Thomas Jefferson is recording his beloved garden 's progress : " May 16 , 1774 : First dish of peas comes to table . . .
