<p> Yesterday , The Chronicle examined the record of the Republican candidate for senator , Michael Huffington . Today , a look at the Democratic candidate , incumbent Dianne Feinstein . <p> For much of the spring , Senator Dianne Feinstein walked the halls of Congress with a set of index cards in her pocket . <p> Democratic leaders had warned the first-term senator that her proposed ban on assault weapons had no chance . But the vote tally contained on the cards showed otherwise . <p> " I went member to member , phone call to phone call , " Feinstein said , recalling how she pleaded , bargained and persuaded other senators . <p> Against all predictions , the assault-weapons ban passed , and when President Clinton signed the crime bill before 2,000 dignitaries last week , Feinstein was seated directly behind him . <p> The former San Francisco mayor has experienced a meteoric rise in her 20 months in Washington , quickly emerging as a powerful voice in the Senate . In stark contrast to her challenger , Representative Michael Huffington , she is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is adept at keeping her name in the public eye . <p> RAPID PACE <p> During her first 20 months in Washington , Feinstein kept a bustling legislative pace . She introduced 24 bills and 14 amendments , and signed on as a co- sponsor to 131 additional measures . <p> She is frequently a guest on the Sunday morning television shows  --  the proving ground for Washington insiders  --  and still meets with gushing looks from tourists and staff aides as she walks through the Capitol . <p> Beyond her statuesque appearance , which distinguishes her from other members of the nearly all-male Senate , her prominence has been built on two foundations  --  her quick study of how to pass legislation and her keen sense of what will play well politically . <p> " I know what it takes to be effective in the Senate , and I think I have been , " she boasted during a recent interview . <p> Her short Senate term  --  she was elected in 1992 in a special election to fill the seat vacated by Governor Wilson  --  has been marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken tough stances against crime and illegal immigration , has been outspoken on women 's issues and has been an unabashed promoter of spending projects that benefit California . <p> With an eye toward public relations , her staff has been extremely aggressive in making these positions known , scheduling frequent news conferences and faxing reporters a stream of news releases . When a reporter recently asked an aide for a list of the senator 's accomplishments , he was sent a 52-page summary in addition to a stack of pamphlets and news releases . <p> Feinstein has been an ally of the Clinton administration when the relationship fits her agenda , but has had no hesitation about abandoning the president when it appears politically advantageous to do so . <p> When Clinton introduced his health reform legislation amid much enthusiasm last fall , Feinstein 's name was among the co- sponsors . By the time the legislation had died a fitful death this summer , she had removed her name . Last fall , she kept the president and a thousand supporters waiting several hours at a San Francisco fund-raiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot against the North American Free Trade Agreement , which Clinton supported . <p> " There have been some frustrating times , " sighed one White House aide . " She 's certainly not intimidated by the president . " <p> If Feinstein ruled San Francisco with an imperial touch , she has come to Washington more like a pit bull . <p> Senator Joseph Biden , the powerful Delaware Democrat who chairs the Judiciary Committee , recalled his reaction when she first approached him about adding the assault-weapons ban to his crime bill . <p> " I thought she was naive to think she could get the votes , and I thought she underestimated the power of the National Rifle Association , " Biden recalled . <p> But Biden watched in awe as Feinstein succeeded where others had failed . <p> " She was absolutely , totally relentless , " he recalled . " She just about drove me nuts . " The success of the assault-weapon ban was a classic example of the Feinstein style , honed during nine years as mayor and eight on the Board of Supervisors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without knowing she had the votes . <p> " I 've spent a lot of time just sitting on the ( Senate ) floor , just watching my colleagues , getting to know them , trying to get to know their needs as legislators , " Feinstein said . " So if I have a proposal that has some controversy attached to it , I know where to go to get votes . " <p> A turning point in the assault- weapons debate in the House came when Feinstein presented pro-gun , conservative Republican Henry Hyde of Illinois a list of gunshot victims from his Chicago-area district . Hyde said the material persuaded him to support the ban . <p> " She changed Henry Hyde 's position , " Biden marveled . " That changed the whole goddamn thing . " <p> Feinstein has a keen sense for hot political issues , and her populist positions have angered some who believe that she places political expediency above principle . <p> For example , her tough rhetoric on the issue of illegal immigration has galled some liberal supporters who think she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval rating . <p> Feinstein has held numerous news conferences to push her immigration control plan , which would create a counterfeit-proof work identification card , limit public benefits to undocumented immigrants , boost border patrols by nearly a third and charge a $ 1 crossing fee at the U.S. border . <p> CLASHING WITH KENNEDY <p> Such positions have put her at odds with civil libertarians , such as Senator Edward Kennedy , D- Mass. , who walked out of a committee hearing this summer rather than listen to Feinstein deliver another speech on immigration . <p> Feinstein has also upset some environmentalists , who have accused her of selling out to the state 's farming and cattle industry by criticizing the administration 's attempts to protect an endangered species of rats in the Central Valley , and her opposition to the administration 's plan to double fees charged to ranchers who graze livestock on federal lands . <p> Critics say Feinstein 's liberal leanings shine through most clearly on fiscal matters , where she is a proud supporter of government spending  --  particularly when it benefits California . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her proclivity toward spending bills earned her just a 13 percent rating from Citizens Against Government Waste , which tracks congressional votes . <p> She led a lengthy , but unsuccessful , fight to block the closing of California military bases , at one point arguing on the Senate floor with Senator Sam Nunn , D- Georgia , a well-known advocate of military spending , that the defense cuts were going to far . <p> " I am totally impressed , " said Marilyn Berry Thompson , a Washington lobbyist for 25 years whose clients now include the city of San Francisco . " She knows the legislative process . She 's persistent , and she 's thorough . " <p> SECURED FUNDS <p> Berry said Feinstein was instrumental in securing tens of millions of federal dollars for San Francisco to complete a sewage overflow project , to provide housing for patients with AIDS , to finance local children 's programs and to fix up City Hall . <p> Although Huffington , and other Republicans , chide her for loading legislation with " pork , " Feinstein defends her support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her prowess . A sampling of news releases faxed to reporters over the past two months includes : <p> " Feinstein announces $ 5.9 million in federal house grants for Fresno . " " Senators Feinstein and Boxer announce $ 845,000 for California to provide job training to veterans . " " San Diego company to receive $ 22.8 million in loan guarantees to modernize Southern California shipyard . " " Senators Feinstein and Boxer announce $ 21 million in federal funds for San Francisco . " " Senate approves $ 9 million for housing at Los Angeles Air Force base . " " Senator Feinstein announces $ 10 million education grant for California . " <p> When Feinstein was mayor , she often remarked that she preferred the executive branch to the legislative . She no longer is so sure . <p> " The first six to eight months ( in the Senate ) were a real challenge for me , " she said last week while campaigning for another term . " I think I 've done things that people said could n't be done . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands on the issues : <p> . <p> * HEALTH CARE  --  Feinstein originally backed President Clinton 's plan for national health care but removed her name as a supporter when the bill ran into trouble in Congress . She now supports changes in the health care system but has not signed on to any specific plan . <p> * CRIME BILL  --  She supported President Clinton 's omnibus crime bill and authored the federal assault-weapons ban . She favors strong enforcement of that prohibition and the ban on ammunition clips that hold more than 10 bullets . She wants local governments to develop crime prevention programs that will work for their communities . <p> * ABORTION  --  She favors a woman 's right to choose an abortion and full federal financing for abortions . She promises to only nominate pro-choice supporters to the federal bench . <p> * ENVIRONMENT  --  She led the fight to restore the California Desert Bill , but she also has upset some environmentalists . They have accused her of selling out to the state 's farming and cattle industry by criticizing the administration 's attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley and object to her opposition to the administration 's plan to double fees charged to ranchers who graze livestock on federal lands . <p> * LEGISLATION  --  During her first 20 months in Washington , she introduced 24 bills and 14 amendments , and she signed on as a co-sponsor to 131 additional measures .
