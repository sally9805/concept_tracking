Section : Focus On Technology A first look at Riven , the follow-up to a computer-game legend <p> THE SETTING : A ROCK-WALLED space illuminated by a single bulb , possibly a cave or dungeon . A woman enters , holding something swathed in red cloth . She wears beads and bracelets and a tunic with triangular silver baubles . Unfurling the fabric , she releases a book and pushes it forward , as if urging someone to take it . But the language she speaks  --  Rivenese  --  is understood only in an imaginary world , itself created by a fictional character . Fifteen times , the woman repeats this brief sequence , until someone yells that the scene is a wrap . Cameras off . And the long- , long-awaited sequel to Myst , the most popular CD-ROM game in history , is several seconds closer to completion . <p> Until now , information on the follow-up to Myst , the 1993 groundbreaking interactive drama that finally gave 2.5 million people a reason to use their home computers , has been harder to find than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One fan even set up a Web site to sift through rumors of the new game 's arrival . ) But the creators of the tale , brothers Rand and Robyn Miller , have granted NEWSWEEK a peek at the work , which is still deeper in progress than the Miller sibs and their anxious distributor , Broderbund , had hoped . The targeted release date is not until next summer . So much for the bad news . The happier revelation is that the multidisc sequel , entitled Riven , just may top its predecessor in visual intensity , gameplay , plot , characterization and  --  hooray  --  coherence . <p> Did we utter the S word ? Sorry . We 're not working on the sequel , ' insists 37-year-old Rand Miller , the brother who monitors the technology side of affairs . We 're working on the next big thing . We want to be the thing that tops Myst . ' Brother Robyn , 30 , an artist and musician , affirms that Riven , though its story line picks up on the Mystian saga , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have a world that is so much more believable than Myst was . ' Whether it 's the pod-shaped buildings that house some of Riven 's inhabitants or an exquisitely rendered wood-grained texture on a nightstand in a character 's bedroom , he says , you have a feeling that this is a real place . All of it ends up looking more varied and real than Myst . ' <p> In fact , the mammoth , two-year modeling effort on Riven will make the Myst graphics  --  much heralded for their arty photorealism  --  look like rough drafts of reality . Where Myst , for example , featured a mountain slope with one kind of rock , a Riven mountain slope has topsoil as well as rock . Even fans might not remember , but there were no clouds in Myst , and the water did n't move . In Riven there are clouds , and the water not only moves but shimmers . All of this requires the kind of computer power previously exploited only by military operations , major universities and George Lucas . Cyan , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 pricey Silicon Graphics workstations cranking out 3-D computer models for thousands of objects , down to the container that holds the juice that goes in Gehn 's pipe , ' says Rand . ( Gehn is one of Riven 's main characters . ) The software used to render these objects is made by SoftImage , the company that did Jurassic Park 's ' dinosaurs . And the SoftImage people claim that in terms of techno-complexity , the Miller brothers ' effort makes Jurassic ' look puny . <p> While the graphics are eating up much of the costly production effort ( an estimated $5 million as opposed to $600,000 for Myst ) , the brothers are equally proud of Riven 's spiffed-up plot and character development . There really was n't much of a story ' in Myst , admits Robyn . But Myst veterans wo n't be surprised when they learn that Riven 's improved plot will be revealed only by exploration . You 'll get it as you go around ; it 's an a-ha experience , ' he adds . <p> This much can be revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't spent the estimated 40 hours of gameplay required to get to that point ( or consulted a cheat book to get there ) , that 's where you learn that Atrus , the world-making bibliophile who lived on Myst Island , is trying to free his wife , Catherine , who has apparently been imprisoned in some other world , one called Riven . It turns out that Atrus 's father , Gehn , is also trapped there , an interesting development since Gehn himself created that world by writing ' it in one of his magic books . The player 's task is to go to Riven and help Atrus , particularly by freeing his spouse . <p> But just as was the case with Myst , the real pleasure of Riven will be the ability to wander a magical , yet realistically rendered landscape , trying to solve vexing puzzles in order to discover more . ( This approach , a strong contrast to carnage-laden games like Doom , has helped Myst win a female audience ; as much as 40 percent of Mysters were women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to browse . You can get lost in this real world , ' promises Rand , who also vows that the puzzles will be more closely related to the plot . Another difference will be that with Riven , the quest wo n't be as solitary . Myst had a lonely feel , ' says Rand . There were only fleeting appearances by a few characters , played by the brothers themselves and filmed in a basement in four days . Riven , by contrast , will use nearly 70 live-action sequences including professional actors , such as a 71-year-old Shakespearean thespian for the Gehn role , and a horde of extras , costumed by the Seattle Opera Company , who play villagers , guards and the rebel woman in the scene described above , filmed last week in San Francisco . <p> Riven explorers will also encounter some strange creatures . They wo n't be scary in a monster sense but perhaps like a killer whale , ' explains Richard Vander Wende , a computer artist hired by the Millers after working on Disney 's Aladdin . ' Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyan , though their Riven names are yet to be determined . The idea , says Rand , was to try to come up with a creature that you could find in National Geographic . But when you look at it you see weird textures and tusks in places you 've never seen them before . ' <p> It 's the prospect of creating such novelty that keeps the Millers going , though surely after their megablockbuster they could have gone in other directions . Hollywood offers abounded , and there was always the prospect of early retirement on the mammoth sales of Myst , related paraphernalia ( everything from posters to duffel bags ) and royalties on a fat book deal for Myst-based novels . Instead , the offspring of a local minister stayed home , retained their modest homes and cars , and built up Cyan , their privately held company . I would n't have been content to rest on my laurels after that product , ' says Robyn . The stakes in following a $100 million blockbuster are very high , and some analysts think a repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company in need of another hit , indicates that 85 percent of Myst buyers will snap up the successor . <p> The mood at the Miller brothers ' company is collegial though intense . Though Cyan is headquartered in a suburban office building , there are Myst-like touches : a moat , a planetarium-like ceiling in the basement art department and innumerable scuff marks on the conference-room windows , a legacy of Frisbees hurled inaccurately in frequent matches of disc golf . ' Small distractions to deflect the pressure of following up a landmark in gaming that , to the astonishment and delight of the Millers , has yet to be surpassed . We always expected that someone would leapfrog Myst before we did , ' says Rand . Now it appears that the great leap will come next summer , with Riven . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Miller 's new tale : Robyn , Rand <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Cooler than Myst : Riven took years to make , at a cost of millions <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : It 's a wrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEVEN LEVY AND PATRICIA KING <p>
