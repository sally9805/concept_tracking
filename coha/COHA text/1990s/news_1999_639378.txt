<p> DIALING UP IMPROVEMENTS Federal officials should reject a proposal that could harm average telephone consumers and undercut efforts to improve service in many rural Colorado communities . <p> Several major phone companies recently negotiated proposed changes in how they collect " access charges , " which pay for the essential link between the long-distance system and the local phone network . <p> The plan will help phone giants such as AT &T,; Sprint , BellSouth , Bell Atlantic and SBC Communications - but not the public . <p> Currently , long-distance carriers collect the access charges , then give the money to the local phone companies that maintain the connections . The new plan would have local phone companies collect the access charges directly . <p> But while long-distance carriers no longer would do the collecting , the proposal does n't require them to proportionately lower their prices . Consumer groups claim when access charges have decreased in the past , long-distance carriers have n't passed the entire savings on to consumers . Critics of the proposal thus fear it may just raise the total amount customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brag it includes a $ 650 million contribution to the universal service fund , which helps rural communities and the very poor afford phone service . But the contribution is insultingly small in the face of a potential windfall of some $ 5.6 billion annually . Denver-based US West , which only partly endorsed the plan , calls the amount the plan provides for the universal service fund " woefully low , " and wants the amount increased substantially . US West also says that to encourage competition in rural areas , any phone company that wants to serve these communities should be able to tap into the fund . <p> Even if those sensible recommendations were adopted , other aspects of the plan would remain troubling . <p> Right now , a Coloradan with just one residential phone line pays about $ 4.50 a month in access charges . These customers include the working poor and most middle-class folks . <p> But consumers who have a second phone line - to monitor their Internet stock trades , for example - pay about $ 10 a month in access charges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system more , pay more . In contrast , under the proposal all phone users would pay access charges at a flat $ 7 per month rate . People who heavily use the system would get a break , but people who use it less would shoulder an unfair price hike . <p> The Federal Communications Commission , which must approve the proposal , should tell the phone giants it will reject the plan - unless its backers incorporate key consumer protections , including US West 's suggestions .  --   --   --  <p> SEPARATE TABLES <p> After decades of civil rights struggles and efforts to raise people 's consciousness about the richness of diversity - and the enlightenment to be gained from others ' cultures - about half of young blacks and whites in a new poll say , " It 's OK if races are basically separate . " <p> It 's only natural , it seems . In every city across America , people tend to settle primarily in neighborhoods with those of their own ethnic origin . Many Denver blacks have gravitated to northeast Denver , while a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose origins are widely varied , often are concentrated in neighborhoods as well . Immigrant Russians occupy Glendale , just as immigrant Italians once " owned " northwest Denver . <p> Yet the findings from the latest Zogby International poll have raised concerns among public-affairs specialists , who fear that with school districts dismantling integration efforts , Americans will wind up with self-imposed segregation , both at home and in school . <p> That 's a legitimate concern . If the population trend in neighborhoods is mirrored in schools , which already is happening in many places , then many children could grow up with no concept whatsoever about people of other races . <p> It 's a thought-provoking problem without any clear solutions . People tend to gravitate toward those with whom they feel comfortable . That is a positive trend in many respects , because it strengthens cultural ties and communities , and it helps to ensure that the legacy of any given culture will be passed on to its next generation . <p> When such trans-generational exchanges are fractured , much of a culture can be lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reservations to seek work in mainstream America . <p> Yet when people cling only to their own , they also lose the opportunity to be enriched and enlightened by experiencing cultural and other differences . They also are less likely to develop a healthy tolerance for people who are different , be they Jewish , gay , Asian or Latino . <p> Our deep need for tolerance - in a society pockmarked by hate groups - is n't likely to be met if full-fledged segregation becomes normal during childhood . Much hate is built on fear that springs from ignorance . But such fear can be banished by familiarity . Despite the instinctive urge to embrace only our own , harmony will be only achieved when we learn to embrace others as well , and to regard the entire human race as our true family .  --   --   --  <p> THE TOBACCO SUIT Several southern governors have mounted a last-minute drive to build congressional opposition to a federal lawsuit against the nation 's major tobacco companies . The governors ' arguments are both political and legal - and seem compelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether to approve a Department of Justice request for a $ 20 million appropriation to fund the federal lawsuit . Critics of the proposal have pointed out that the Justice Department is already well-funded and employs thousands of lawyers . Assigning 40 attorneys to the case would hardly bankrupt the agency . Second , there is a growing suspicion that the department has made the request only to get Congress on record as " supporting " the lawsuit . <p> This issue of support could become crucial down the line , when and if , a court is asked to decide the threshold question of whether the federal government even has the right to sue the tobacco companies . <p> There are attorneys within the justice department who have argued for years that without specific authority from Congress , the department has no right to sue . These attorneys cite a U.S. Supreme Court case , U.S. vs . Standard Oil of California , in which the court said it was up to Congress to establish that a liability exists . Congress , of course , has never taken that step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governors ' arguments are mostly political . They argue that in investigating the possibility of a lawsuit the justice department is engaged in a political act , responding as it is to President Clinton 's declaration this year that such a suit should be filed . They also point out that a lawsuit against tobacco would single out a specific business group for special treatment and thus establish a poor precedent . <p> For our part , we oppose any special appropriation to fund a federal lawsuit against the major tobacco companies and believe that Congress should consider passing an act specifically barring the lawsuit absent a showing that the existing law is on the department 's side . <p> The already completed settlement between the tobacco companies and various states will provide some $ 206 billion over a 30-year period . Colorado 's share of this settlement is in excess of $ 2 billion . As we have said before , there are good reasons for state officials to resist a federal lawsuit . Under the terms of the settlement , state revenues might well be diminished should the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus driving down their revenues . <p> For all of these reasons , we urge Congress to reject the Justice Department request for specific funds to finance a federal tobacco lawsuit .
