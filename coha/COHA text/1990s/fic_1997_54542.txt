They head south , and as they move out from under the dense Baltimore sky toward air and ocean and hot sun , Flo and Matthew beg their mother , Marie-Claude , to tell stories . Flo loves the ones about when Marie-Claude was as young as she is now , and Matthew wants to hear , over and over , how he was born . <p> Because Marie-Claude does not want her children to talk about their father , who left her at the end of last spring , nearly a year ago now , she gives them the stories they ask for . She tells Flo about Alain Delor , her first crush , and Matthew about the market in Paris where her sac broke as she stood buying peaches in the rain . <p> But when she begins the story about her first dance , Flo interrupts her . " What about the ghosts in Austria , Morn ? Is n't there one about some ghosts at a fancy ball ? " <p> Marie-Claude shakes her head , certain she has never told either child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself up closer from the back seat . " Yeah , there is . " Some of her mother 's fine hair tangles around her fingers , sticky from candy . <p> " Damn it , Florence . That hurts . " <p> " Maman ! " Matthew says , truly shocked to hear an English swearword out of his mother 's mouth . <p> Marie-Claude is surprised , too , and a bit alarmed by the sudden swell of anger . She had promised herself no harsh words to Flo today . <p> She looks at the enormous clock beside the speedometer : four more hours . She wonders if Flo or even both of them should have gone with their father to New York instead of coming with her to Hatteras . She can not predict her moods , or the size of Bill and Karen 's house , or whether Matthew and Flo will like her friends ' children . She wishes she had enough money to fly them home to Lyon for Easter . She takes her eyes from the road to the fields beside them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wishes she could go on looking sideways . <p> Matthew says , " What story about ghosts in Austria ? Watch the road , Maman . What story about ghosts ? " She knows he will persist , never forget , not for one day of their vacation . <p> " It was in a castle " Flo says , " a really old spooky castle that used to be a big deal , like a king or a count used to live there or something . And Daddy was there . I think they were engaged then . Were you engaged to Daddy then ? Please tell it , Mom . " <p> Marie-Claude wonders how Flo can know about Austria . Sometimes it feels there is nothing about her life her children can not uncover , can not redefine . Once , she had thought there would be a certain amount of grace and mystery in being a parent , and that what went unsaid about her experiences would be respected , and what was revealed would be absorbed without contradiction , occasionally sanctified . Was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Perhaps it is because they are American , these children of hers . <p> " You two tell me stories . I 'm tired of talking . " <p> " No , " says Flo . " Tell the ghost story . Please , Mommy , please . Please ! " <p> Matthew joins in , and MarieClaude lets them continue far past the point at which she assumed they 'd stop , until their chanting unsettles her more than the idea of telling another story . " Okay , ' she says . " Okay . " <p> " Your father was n't with me then " she begins . " I had n't even met him . " She tries but fails to conceal the pleasure she takes in this fact . " I went with my cousin Giselle . She had been invited by her best friend at boarding school in Lausanne , Sigrid . The ball was just outside Linz at a palace that had once belonged to a Habsburg archduke , Franz or Friedle or someone , one of Francis the First 's sixteen children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced out of the country by the new government . Eventually , it was resold to this Sigrid 's grandparents . I did n't know much of the history . I just knew that Giselle traveled with a pack of rich friends and that Sigrid was n't the only one who could throw a party in her own castle . And I was a bit more like your father then . I loved big houses and beautiful clothes . " <p> " He does not " Flo says , but even in her irritation at one of her mother 's jabs , she ca n't muster up enough conviction to pursue an argument . She has already begun to notice how her father seems more pleased when she plays at Janine 's house with the pool than at Lynn 's apartment . <p> Marie-Claude instantly regrets the comparison , regrets this mood on the first day of their trip , and rushes on . " My date was one of Sigrid 's cousins , a sullen boy who seemed to want to talk about nothing else but the strategical blunders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one war , and he has the nerve to bring up the failure of the Maginot line ! But I did n't really care . I was at a ball in fancy dress and could laugh at just about anything . " <p> Flo marvels at the thought of her mother ( whom friends call a slob , who always wears her hair yanked back with a brown rubber band off the newspaper ) in a ball gown , patiently humoring her date . Flo is beginning to question these images her mother feeds them of her disposition before she married her father . She always makes herself out to have been giggly and lighthearted , the gravity of life never pulling on her until she found herself married with children to raise . But her mother 's face is serious , has always been serious , her expression in even the most spontaneous childhood photographs resembling , as her father once said , the portrait of a cabinet minister . <p> Slowly , the story begins to make Marie-Claude feel better as she describes the carriage they rode in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twilight . She senses her children 's full attention , Flo 's syrupy breath near her ear and Matthew 's small body turned sideways toward her , and this audience makes her feel needed in a more extravagant , less basic way than usual . <p> There is so much to tell : the gardens , the courtyard , the intricate bodice of her dress . Finally , the words she chooses are the right ones ; they take on the exact shape and magnificence of the moment they describe . She feels strong and alive , driving her children south on a smooth highway . <p> She tries not to think beyond it where somewhere there is an unfamiliar dirt road that she must find in the dark . They will arrive late , and Marie-Claude , who promised to be there for dinner , will be treated like a reckless child by Bill and Karen , who are a real family , complete with bicycles and a live-in sitter . And no matter how many games her children invent in the water or how relaxed she feels half-asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , winter-tender feet hobbling down the rocky path to the beach will remind them all each day of what is gone . <p> " Mom , ' Flo says , and , when her mother does n't respond immediately , " Where were the ghosts ? " <p> " The ballroom was enormous and filled with these fabulous gowns and tuxes and champagne goblets . The floor was black marble , and I remember how sleek , like sapphires or the fur of a black panther ? ' <p> " Is that where you saw them , on the dance floor ? " <p> " No , I saw her in the garden . " Marie-Claude feels a face , a squat forehead , the sharp edge of an aquiline nose , an ugly , distended mouth , taking shape within her . " She was young , perhaps the same age as I was then , but her face was old with sadness . She held herself straight , upright , but inside she was bent with grief ? ' <p> " How did you know she was a ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it . You feel it . " <p> " Was she see-through ? Did you speak to her ? " <p> " She was different . Something about her movements . And she was so sad , the way she walked around the garden , touching petals and branches , as if she could rid some of her sadness on them . It might have been the way her mouth was shaped . I do n't know . It 's difficult to describe how I knew . " <p> With a push-off from her mother 's headrest , Flo falls back hard in her seat . She pops a sourball from its cellophane wrapper and , after putting it into her mouth , sighs loudly . <p> A sweet fake-lime smell works its way quickly to the front . " Have I lost you ? " Marie-Claude says , finding Flo 's bulging cheek in the rearview mirror . <p> " Nothing happens in this story . " <p> Marie-Claude has an awful impulse ( because they are so rude , demanding the story she did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew already asleep ) to remind them of sadness . It would be so easy to do . She waits for the resentment to subside , then continues : " She was n't transparent , but her skin was peculiar . I 'm sure that 's how I knew she was n't human ? ' <p> " What do you mean , peculiar ? " <p> " It was like patina almost , that greenish color that gets on certain metals , you know , the wav that bracelet of your father 's , the one he wears for his imaginary arthritis , the way that turns when he forgets to make someone polish it . That 's how her skin looked up close . " Instead of the woman , the wrist appears , its hairless skin beneath the bracelet , the puffed vein that travels from his hand to his elbow . She still loves him . If he does not come back ( they are not divorced , not even legally separated ) , she knows she will never stroke a man 's arm again , never tease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I like polishing it . He does n't make me . " <p> " Oh , Flo , you do n't remember . You used to hate it . The polish stung your eyes . Anyway , that was her skin . " Beside her , Matthew 's head , which has been slipping and jerking back , slipping and jerking back , finally slides all the way over to the armrest on his door . She checks the lock and feels for a moment what he feels : that delicious surrender to sleep in the passenger seat of someone else 's car . <p> " I did n't hate it . And I still do it , too . " Flo thinks of the chance she had to go with her father and his girlfriend , Abigail , to Manhattan instead . She had to choose between ocean and museums , big house with other kids and adjoining hotel rooms ( snapped shut at bedtime till morning ) . All that seems insignificant now . As always when absent , her father has become mild and soothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.C. He is n't leaving until tomorrow morning . How much could a bus ride cost ? <p> " I did speak to her . " Marie-Claude turns around to see if Flo will still listen . Flo does n't look up from what she is doing : dropping quarters from one hand into another , then back into a pouch . " I asked her if she was enjoying the ball . " Marie-Claude laughs . " I did n't know what else to ask ! " <p> " Did you speak French or German ? " <p> " German , I think . But she did n't reply in a voice  --  it was more like telepathy . But she did n't want to chat . She moved right past me , back to her old route around and around the rose garden . " <p> " This is n't the same story . " <p> " I 've never told this story to you before , so I do n't know what you were expecting . " <p> When she told it to her husband , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd become . She described everything carefully , their movements , their fingers , the shapes of their mouths . We must n't become them , Robert , not yet . But he did n't understand . He had stopped wanting to understand her . <p> " Mom , you 're lying . You always do this . " <p> " What do you mean , I always do this ? " <p> " Change things around . Lie about the truth . " <p> " I 'm not lying , Florence . " And Marie-Claude sees more clearly the scrolled , unbloomed rosebushes , the small pool , more rosebushes , and the woman traveling through . " I have never lied to you . " Each time around the far edge , the woman lifts her skirt so it does n't catch on a spigot . " I am not the liar in this family " <p> " Yes , you are . You lie all the time " <p> " Flo , I do not . " For comfort , she knows she can turn to Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her sunglasses in his lap . " Name one lie I 've ever told you . " <p> " You said we could take Belle with us . You promised we could . " <p> " I thought Bill and Karen would bring their dogs , but they did n't , so I could n't very well ask to bring ours . We 're guests . It would n't have been right . " <p> " But you lied . You said one thing and did another . " <p> " Flo , that was completely out of my control . That 's not a lie . " <p> " All right , here 's a better one , " and this is something she 's wanted to mention for a while now . " You told me that you and Daddy separated suddenly , that you were both in love all those years when I was little . You always told us that , Mom , that we were born out of love " <p> Marie-Claude is relieved it 's only this , and not some other broken promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We loved each other very , very much . " There was no day happier in all her life than the day Matthew was born . They were living in Paris then . That morning at the market is still so vivid : the wet stalls , the bag of peaches , the young face of the vendor , the train of pimples across his neck . She was reaching over the cherries to squeeze an avocado when she felt the warmth on her legs , when she finally made the distinction between her own water and the rain . And in the afternoon , Robert brought Flo to the hospital . They climbed right up on the bed with her and Matthew and pretended they did n't understand French when the nurse scolded them . That day was just a culmination of the happiness that had been pooling inside her from the moment she met Robert , yet afterwards there was only more , a peaceful , languorous bliss . They had jokes about it , about how so much happiness was depressing . " All those years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy . You were born and raised with a tremendous amount of love . " <p> " And then something just happened , just like that ? " <p> " I do n't know . " Marie-Claude ca n't bear to play the victim , to actually reveal how bewildered she still is . But her daughter wants the truth . " I just do n't know . Whatever happened did n't happen to me . " She looks at Flo in the rearview mirror and says softly , with no edge , " Maybe Daddy can explain it better . " <p> " He says it happened slowly . He said it was n't a big clap of thunder like you say but a wave that gets bigger and bigger until it breaks . " <p> Marie-Claude knows Flo is not making this up to hurt her ; she recognizes her husband 's similes , stolen from a world entirely alien to him . <p> " He said he 'd been unhappy since before Matthew . He said he had n't known anything about real love before he met Abigail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he always knows when they 're lying because  --  " <p> " Please , Flo . Please stop . " <p> Marie-Claude slows to the speed limit . Her eyes have been on the road , but she has not been watching . All the windows in the car are open , even hers , which she does n't remember rolling down . Warm air , much warmer than an hour ago , blows through , and she leans forward to let the wind unstick the shirt from her back . The steering wheel feels loose in her hands , unrelated to guiding the car . And the road , even at fifty-five , is disappearing far too fast beneath them . <p> She thinks of what she could remind her daughter of . She could tell the story of Flo 's last birthday in September , which fell on a weekend she went to her father 's alone , without Matthew , and how at first Flo thought he was teasing , not singing at the breakfast table , not alluding to a present hidden somewhere  --  behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to check the Saturday mail at his office she expected a surprise party ; at lunch she waited for a cake . When he returned her on Sunday , MarieClaude read the whole story in the raised rash on Flo 's neck . <p> When she feels a bit more in control of the car , Marie-Claude turns to look at the outlet stores beside the highway . She wishes they were driving through France , passing cows spread flat out on a hill . In France they might come across something extraordinary , like a burning barn or a ewe giving birth . Flo might see it first , and , even before she could ask , Marie-Claude would pull over . They would get out of the car noiselessly so as not to disturb Matthew and witness together the hot collapse of a building or the equally overwhelming spectacle of new life dropping onto the grass . They might squeeze each other 's fingers in anticipation . But barns in France , she remembers , are made of stone . <p> From the slice she can see of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is angry . She decides she will just have MarieClaude let her off at a bus station before going on to the house . There would be northbound buses every few hours . Her father will be jubilant , even more pleased than if she 'd decided on New York from the start . <p> Her mother is not looking back anymore ; Flo has caught her in too many lies . But she is not through . Before she goes , takes a bus her mother will be more than happy to put her on , she wants to catch her in another lie . " You love Matthew more than me , ' she says . " You do . " <p> This is an accusation Marie-Claude has feared since Matthew was born . She is amazed that this is the first time it has ever been uttered . Until now , she never knew what she would say . Today , the answer slides out effortlessly : " He makes it easier for me , Flo . He 's easier to love . " She waits for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hears only , after a long silence , the crinkling of another candy wrapper . She lets her statement linger between them , hardening into fact . It gives her strength , a sense of utter freedom . They feel like the first honest words she has ever spoken . <p> More than an hour later , still in the back seat , legs draped over her big duffel that she 's already practiced lifting twice to make sure she can carry it to the bus , Flo remembers how she heard the story about the ghost . It was the first night she 'd ever spent in her father 's apartment , after the separation . Her whole life is now divided into what came before and what came after the separation . This was just after , in those first few weeks whose details are impossible to recall . But she has a flash , in this hot car heading south , of crying in a brand-new bed , begging her father for a story to put her to sleep . He did n't know how to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe him . Anyone can tell a story , she screamed at him . Anyone . Finally he sat on the bed and told her how when they were very young , he and Marie-Claude ( and Flo remembers this , too , how he said Marie-Claude and not Mom like he used to , as if her mother was now a sister or a friend of the family ) had been invited to a castle in Austria . In his version , he saw the ghosts . And Marie-Claude did n't believe him . No one did , he told Flo . They all thought he was nuts . But as the night went on , he became friends with these ghosts and , though he could n't tell Flo exactly how , got them back to their other world safely . Remembering this ending , Flo laughs out loud . <p> " Look " she hears her mother say softly to herself . The ocean is suddenly beside them . They have reached the beginning of the cape earlier than expected , before dinner , before sunset . Waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that quickly fills the car . Plump seabirds stand on one leg in the shimmering glaze left behind . Flo forgets to mention the bus station . <p> Marie-Claude feels Matthew stir beside her . " Look " she whispers again , and he opens his eyes onto the wide shaft of blue alongside the car , turns to her , and asks her to tell him , just once more , the one about how he was born . <p> <p> By LILY KING <p>
