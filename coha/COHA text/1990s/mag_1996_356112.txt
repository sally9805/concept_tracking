My friends in the newspaper business have been coming back from trips to Microsoft in Redmond , Washington , in terror . There is no hope for us , my pals say . Already Bill Gates has sent out advance teams to hover like those spaceships in Independence Day over 10 major U.S. cities . In each , Microsoft Network ( MSN ) employees are setting up regional Websites that will publish local listings of movies , concerts , restaurant reviews and so forth , draining readers and ads from the local newspapers and eventually turning them into dust . Two dozen other glitzy programs , some suspiciously magazine-like , will finish off the rest of us . Not satisfied to dominate the software industry , Microsoft is spending $100 million a year to blitz the media business . My business . Know your enemy , I figure . So I fly out there for a look . <P> Microsoft retainers take me to a sprawling campus called Red West . It resembles a modern state university . Five low-lying , heavily fenestrated buildings squat expectantly around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a chicken farm . " Microsoft is huge , " I mumble numbly . Sensing my confusion , my guides point out that this is just a suburb of the main Microsoft headquarters , which is 25 times as large and looks , when I finally see it , about the size of Minneapolis . Around 20,000 Microserfs work there . Some people call it the Hive . I yawn , feigning a lack of interest . The yawn might have sounded like a moan . I do n't know . <P> We walk into one of the Red West buildings , past innumerable , indistinguishable offices that honeycomb the place . Everyone gets an office with a window , so you ca n't tell the bosses from the people who do the real work . In one of them I meet a man who wears glasses so splattered with color they look like Jackson Pollock 's safety goggles . This is Bob Bejan , executive producer of MSN , who began his career as a hoofer on Broadway in A Chorus Line . Later he produced interactive movies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's the guy who " green-lights " MSN 's " shows . " That 's what they call Websites here . Shows . <P> " We aspire to be the poster child of all that 's possible on the Internet , " Bejan says , noting that while 30 million people now have access to the Web , " we want to bring the next 10 million online . " For the next six hours , I get a glimpse of how . Hundreds of people are involved in creating MSN 's shows , from the typographers who choose the fonts to the musicians  --  " the MSN orchestra ! " someone jokes  --  who write the theme songs . Teams of market researchers measure what 's working and what 's not . Shows that do n't make the cut will be replaced by others already in the works . It 's as inevitable as software engineering . Sooner or later , something will stick . <P> But engineering is n't art , and I think my friends may be overreacting . Too much of MSN 's stuff is slick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Gumby-like character that a kid on the tech side had built out of clay at home for fun and then modeled in his workstation , making it do amazing tricks . The day Microsoft figures out how to get that thing out of the kid 's computer and onto the Net is the day my friends should start looking for a new line of work . <P> You can read the Netly News daily on the World Wide Web at
