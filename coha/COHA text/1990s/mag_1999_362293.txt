Ismail Cimen is the most famous boy in the world just now . The five-year-old sits in his hospital bed in Istanbul , watching the procession of toy-bearing journalists from all over the world who have come to hear his tale . He is the last living soul to be plucked from the destruction of the Aug. 17 earthquake , a boy buried so long that his uncle had prepared a grave for him . Says his sister Aysa , 18 : " He was born on June 12 , but his real birthday is the day they pulled him out . " <P> Trapped for six days in the remains of his home in Cinarcik on the Marmara coast , with hardly an inch of space above his face , Ismail was withdrawn and hallucinatory in the early days of his recovery . His mother is in a different hospital with a crushed femur . Ismail seems to sense the unspoken news that his father is dead , as are three sisters . Yet despite his troubles , says Nail Yologlu , one of Ismail 's doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " says the physician , " he is coming to . " <P> All over northwestern Turkey , in the hundreds of square miles savaged by the 7.4-level temblor , people have begun to emerge  --  slowly , fitfully  --  from their stupor . Turkish authorities , whose first response was a scandalous paralysis , have moved into action , directing relief where it is needed , working to forestall a second-wave tragedy of infectious disease . Survivors , many of them at first unwilling to budge from outside their fallen homes , hoping to salvage something  --  if not a loved one , perhaps some hoarded savings  --  are drifting into tent cities . Amid the uncertainty , both the leaders and the governed seem clear on one thing : the Turkey that emerges from this detritus must not be the same place that crumbled on Aug. 17 . <P> While God 's swat at Turkey can be laid at no one 's feet , the destruction it wrought was largely man-made . Though most of the larger factories in the region survived the quake , as well-constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush to accommodate waves of urban migration , collapsed , squashing residents as they slept at 3:02 a.m . At the end of last week , more than 13,000 bodies had been found . The U.N . expected the final toll to climb toward 40,000 , based on the number of pancaked dwellings , making this one of the worst natural disasters to touch Europe in this century . <P> Could it happen again ? The devastated region , a densely populated swath that is Turkey 's industrial backbone , was built above a well-documented fracture , which will certainly rock again . Given that the area was constructed so recklessly in the first place , there is a real danger it will be put back together just as badly . " This is Turkey , " Turks like to say with a shrug , to explain away such absurdities . This time , however , the authorities say they will not make the old mistakes . And Turkey 's people , shaken out of their traditional deference to the state , are determined not to let their leaders backslide.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
