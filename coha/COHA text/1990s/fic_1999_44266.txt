This Hanukkah , Aunt Gert would meet Jill 's new boyfriend , and sparks were sure to fly <p> What do you need a bathtub in the yard for ? " " Aunt Gert asked as Janet ushered her out the sliding door to the patio , where the new spa sat like an aquamarine jewel under the California moon . " All this progress and you end up like your grandma when she first came from Poland , with three families sharing a bathtub on the Lower East Side . " She peered into the yard . Plumes of steam rose from the churning waters and dissipated into the cool December night . " That 's Steve , " Janet whispered , pointing to the blond head bobbing in the water , " Jill 's boyfriend . IT introduce you later , when they , come in . " " They 're taking a bath together , " Aunt Geri gasped . " They 're wearing swimsuits ! " Janet looked to the heavens for guidance . How was she going to make it through this visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Aunt Gert the nature of Jill and Steve 's relationship seemed almost beyond her . Aunt Gert had no use for modem trends ; she thought that permanent-press sheets were the work of the devil . The mere idea that college girls and boys lived in the same building sent her into emotional tirades . If Aunt Gert knew that Jill was sharing an apartment with Steve in the graduate students " housing complex . she would spin through the floorboards like Rumpelstiltskin . Not that this was n't a touchy issue for Janet and her husband , Danny , as well . Jill was a young woman , an adult , and entitled to make her own choices . But at some level , Janet wished for an earlier time , when a daughter was expected to live at home until her wedding day , when her father would give her away . " Maybe I can convince you to go in the spa this weekend , " Janet said to Aunt Gert . " It 's wonderful for whatever ails you . In fact , Danny 's lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1i I once knew a girl in Brooklyn who said she got pregnant in a swimming pool , " Aunt Gert said . " I would n't worry about that , " Janet replied quickly . Though Aunt Gert was the younger sister of Janet 's mother , she seemed to be from another family , an-other planet . While Janet 's mother had embraced the new world in all its intricacies and demands , Aunt Gert had clung to the old ways , spoke Yiddish fluently , and was dedicated to the observance of Jewish rituals . Janet 's mother was much more casual about religious customs . She was pleased that Jill 's boyfriend was a decent , kind boy , and she did n't mind that he was n't Jewish . But Aunt Gert had yet to find out this critical faCt . Janet was amazed she had n't asked yet . A mind reader , perhaps , Aunt Gert leaned over and whispered : " Jill 's friend-he 's Jewish ? " " I 'm afraid not , Aunt Gert . But he 's verv nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor student . Jill and he share manv interests . Next year , after he and Jill graduate , he has a postgraduate grant to study in Germany- " Photograph <p> " Germany ! " Janet bit her tongue . She was n't going to argue the cultural pros and cons of Germany , nor could she say , " And Jill is planning to go with him . " What she did say was , " Come inside , and I 'll get you settled . Then you and I can talk about the plans for our Hanukkah party tomorrow night . " I brought everything we 'll need , " Aunt Gert said , " including your grandmother 's tin menorah . Somehow , I thank God , tradition got into your blood even though your mother does n't care about it . I hope it was my influence . Now maybe we can get some into Jill before it 's too late . " She leaned closer to Janet . " Tell me , has Jill told You an- , , thing ? " " About what ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That I have n't asked , " Janet said . She did n't tell Aunt Gert how often that question had been on the tip of her tongue . She sometimes marveled at her self-control . Feeling beads of sweat forming on her forehead , Janet said , " Girls ... women ... take their time these days . " " These days ... " Aunt Gert shook her white head . I hate to think what the world is coming to . " JILL AND STEVE CAME INTO THE HOUSE glowing , giving off radiance and warmth . Steve had a towel draped over his shoulders , but his chest and legs were clearly visible-muscular and powerful-looking . Janet felt Aunt Gert taking him in , like a vacuum cleaner . Aunt Geri walked up to him , coming barely to his shoulder , and she observed him closely . " Well , he 's a cute little vanis . " What does that mean ? " Jill asked . " A bedbug , " Aunt Gert said . " Thanks a lot , " " Steve said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aunt Gert said , assessing him . " A man with a sense of humor is worth something . " , I passed the test@ " Steve said , looking at Jill and grinning . " No , not yet , " Jill said . " This test is harder than your Ph.D . exam , believe me . " She stood in her blue bathing suit , dripping slightly on the rug . Her dark hair curled in ringlets around her face . " You 'd better change , " Janet suggested . " Me too , " Steve said . Jill took his hand and pulled him down the hall . Aunt Gert leaned over to Janet . " They 're not going to get dressed in the same room ? " " No , Aunt Gert . Of course not ! " IN FACT , JANET I-LD STIPULATED THAT Steve must sleep on the fold-out couch in the family room and not in Jill 's room . She and Jill had been through the entire matter on the phone before Jill brought Steve home for the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for the week of Hanukkah , and then fly to Chicago to spend the remainder of the holiday with his parents . On the phone , Janet had made it clear to Jill what the sleeping arrangements had to be-otherwise Steve would not be coming . Later , Janet had relayed Jill 's response to Danny-that although Jill agreed to comply with the arrangements , she thought it was a pretense . She really did n't see any reason why she and Steve should pretend since they lived together at school . " A little pretense is sometimes a good idea , " Danny had said . He added , " Why do n't they just get married ? " " You sound like Aunt Gert , " Janet said . " When Jill asked me if you and I had ever considered living together before we got married , I told her the truth . That we might have wanted to , but we were more concerned with honoring our families " standards . We did n't want to break our parents " hearts . " " YOU DID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet , as they all sat in the living room . She pointed to the mantel , where a brass menorah sat , unlit , full of pastel candles . " But I did , " Janet said , " at sunset , before you arrived . " She had responded quickly , in automatic self-defense , to ward off guilt , anger-all the emotions Aunt Gert could produce in Janet within seconds . " Today 's candles have burned down , and these are the new ones in place , ready for tomorrow night , the eighth night-see . They 're all here . " I have a deal to make , " Aunt Gert said , " with Jill . " Jill , who had been sitting on the couch with her head resting on Steve 's shoulder , sat up , alert . " I have an heirloom for you , darling . Something that belonged to your greatgrandmother . " From the plastic drawstring bag on her lap , Aunt Gert pulled out an old tin menorah , with intricate designs on the thin metal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to America . Five cents ! That was a lot of money in those days . She was only sixteen when she came here in steerage . She worked as a laundress , then she learned to be a midwife . She came to this country so that her children and their children could have a good life , an education , luxuries like she never dreamed of ! " Aunt Gert motioned toward the patio , where the blue-lit waters of the spa were still shimmering under the moon . Then the stood and brought the menorah over to Jill . " I want you to have it , darling , " she said , " if you promise me that you 'll have your children light Hanukkah candles in it every year and teach them the traditions . " Jill and Steve exchanged glances . " You really want to extract a lifelong pledge from me , Aunt Gert ? " Jill examined the menorah with a kind of awe ; she felt its sharp edges carefully , outlining the lion embossed on the menorah with the tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I do love It . " " It 's great , " Steve said , taking the menorah in his hands as if it were made of the most delicate glass . " I guess I would be willing to agree to vour terms , Aunt Gert , " Jill said . " I 'd certainly like our kids to know their Jewish history and tradition . What do you think ? " she said to Steve . Janet saw Aunt Gert smile triumphantly ; she had asked and answered a dozen questions with this wily move . Aunt Gert reclaimed the menorah . " I want to polish it up a little . Then tomorrow night you can light your first candies in it , Jill . " THE NEXT AFTERNOON , JILL AND STEVE left to do some holiday shopping at the mall , and Aunt Gert unpacked her bags of potatoes and onions . " You have sour cream ? " she asked Janet . " You have applesauce ? I was counting on you to have them . " " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butcher-block counter for Aunt Gert 's ingredients . " We have to get started , " Aunt Gert said . " Nis takes forever . If only my arthritis was n't bothering me . You have another potato peeler ? We 'll both pitch in . " They washed and scrubbed two dozen potatoes , then began peeling , the strips of potato skins flying . " Steve seems like a nice enough boy , " Aunt Gert said . " Did he buy Jill a Hanukkah present ? " " Not that I know of . " " Did she buy one for him ? Tonight 's the last night , you should know by now . " " But I do n't know , Aunt Gert . Please , let 's just work on these potatoes . Sometimes , it 's best to just back off these things and see what happens . " Aunt Gert was shaking her head . " I do n't understand . No one knows what to expect anymore . " Janet looked at her aunt 's face and saw real grief there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life had taken place in another time , and the changes in the mores of this modem world had unnerved her . She was trembling , the fingers holding the peeler shaking with fatigue . Janet took the tool from her hands . " Why do n't you sit down ? I 'll do these , you can just keep me company . " " But we still have to grate , " Aunt Gert said , as if she had to cross a vast desert without water . " We have to grate all the potatoes , all the onions . " " I 'll manage . I 'll have Danny help , and the kids when they get back- I 'll Just peel the potatoes now , and we 'll cover them with water so they do n't discolor . " " Thank you , darling . You were always such a sweet girl . " WHILE AUNT GERT TOOK A NAP , JANET went to the garage and dug through a carton of Jill 's old toys . The dreidel she found Was made of plastic , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned in her childhood came back to her . Dreidel , dreidel , dreidel I made it out of clay , And when it 's diy and ready Then dreidel I shall play . Janet spun the top and watched it careen along the cement floor . Then she picked it up and looked at the four Hebrew letters on each side of the toy . She remembered being told that they stood for the phrase " A great miracle happened here . " The miracle she knew well : When the Jews reclaimed their temple in Jerusalem from the enemies who 'd seized it , they found only a small cruse of oil , enough to bum for only one day . But the oil burned for eight days . Thus , the eight candles in the menorah , plus the shammes , the candle used to light the others . When Jill was little , Janet had bought her presents for each of the eight days ; better even than Christmas , a mere one day of joy-at least , that 's what she 'd told her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the plastic dreidel , and another tune came to her mind : Hanukkah , 0 Hanukkah , Come light the menorah , Let 's have a pam , we 'll all dance the hora , Gather round the table , we 'll give you a treat , Dreidels to play with and pancakes to eat ... The pancakes were yet to be made . Janet went back to the kitchen to set the table for dinner . BY THE TIME STEVE AND JILL RETURNED from the mall , Aunt Gert had gotten her second wind and was back at the sink . " Let 's see , " she said , " for every nine potatoes , we need three onions , three eggs , three tablespoons flour ... " " Want me to help ; " Jill asked . Her color was high . She looked as if she 'd been laughing or running . " I 'll help too , " Steve said . " Just tell me what to do . " " I do n't think you 'll like this food , " Aunt Gert warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jill and I eat Moroccan , Chinese , Thai , Italian , Mexican , and French . And when we live in Germany next year , we hope to get our fill of Wiener schnitzel and oxtail soup . " Aunt Gert glared first at Jill , then at Janet . " So you two children are going together . I had a feeling ... " " Well , yes , we are , " Jill said in a weak , little voice . " We both plan to live and study in Germany next year . " Then she drew a breath and seemed to take courage from it . " Steve and I will be sharing a house next year . " " I see , " Aunt Gert said . " I 'm sorry to hear it . " " I 'm sorry you feel that way , " Jill said . She went over to Aunt Gert and wrapped her arms around her . " Steve and I just ca n't do everything the way it used to be done , or the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the night way for us . We 're still young and figuring things out . But one day , because I know you want to know , we hope to get married , and we hope you 'll come to the wedding . " " I really enjoy Jewish weddings , " Aunt Gert said . " Maybe you can have a rabbi do the service , and Steve can break the glass under his foot . Maybe you 'll even have a klezmer band . " Janet , seeing how quickly Aunt Gert had come to terms with the arrangement , wondered if maybe she had n't already made her private peace with the ways of the new world and had-mainly for the sake of principle and traditionmade it a point to show her " old world " views . Maybe she was mellowing with age . Or maybe she was wiser than Janet had given her credit for . Jill was laughing . " Whoa , Aunt Gert , " she said . " We 'll consider all your requests , I promise , but for now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think you can enjoy that ? " " If only my arthritis was n't killing me , " Aunt Gert said . She turned to the counter and began grating the first potato . I never start on the onions first , " she explained . " They make me cry . " AN HOUR LATER , THERE WERE STILL A dozen potatoes to grate . Janet was working on them . Aunt Gert was doing the onions , crying , wiping her eyes on the back of her hand . Steve stood near the sink , watching . " I ca n't believe what a monumental job this is , " he said . " Can any food be worth this kind of struggle ? " " Maybe I should give up on this , " Aunt Cert said . " I 'm getting too old for it . " She put down the onion in her hand . " Janet , forgive me , I ca n't do any more . " " The kids can take over , " Janet said . " Hey , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall , but he was back in the next instant , carrying a box . " Aunt Gert , " he said , " I have a Hanukkah present for you . " " For me ? " She stared at him . " Well , to tell the truth , I got it for my mother for Christmas , but I 've decided you should have it . I can get her another . They 're on sale . Go ahead , open it . " Aunt Gert wiped her hands on her apron . " What 's this ? " she said . " What could it be ? " She fumbled with the carton . " I 'll get it out for you , " Jill said . She took a knife from the drawer , slit the carton along the taped edge , then lifted out a compact electric appliance . Aunt Gert peered at it . " A food processor ! It 's very nice of you to think of me , but what do I need it for ? You think a good sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch , " Steve said , and with a few precise movements , he plugged in the machine , rinsed the processing bowls , placed a potato upright in the chute , pressed the switch , and then presented Aunt Gert with an entire grated potato . She touched the grated shreds . " It 's a nice texture , " she admitted , " just the way I like it . " " Want to try it ? " Steve asked . " I 'd cut off my finger , " Aunt Gert said . " No , there 's a safety device , " Steve said , " The switch wo n't go on until the top is sealed . " He drew Aunt Gert to stand in front of him and took her hands in his , to guide her . " Now put a potato in the chute . " She dropped a potato into the opening , allowed Steve to press on the switch with her finger , then laughed with delight when the potato came out perfectly grated . " With a machine like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " It has three blades , " Steve said with pride . " Technology in the interest of gastronomy . " " How does it do with coleslaw ? " Aunt Gert asked . " Magnifique , " Steve said , kissing his fingers like a French chef . " You know , " Aunt Gen said , " you 're a good boy . You did a mitzvah , a good deed . Thank you . But I still wish you and Jill would n't go off to some foreign country to live together in the same house ... I 'd rather see you be married first " " We 're working on it , " Steve said . " That I can promise you . " THE PANCAKES BUBBLED AND SIZZLED IN the golden oil , and the aroma of frying onions and potatoes filled the air . Danny , drawn by the smell , came to watch Janet and Aunt Geri , then stayed in the kitchen . The house was engulfed by warmth and the promise of the meal to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Aunt Gert said , " and then the party . " Jill had already transferred the Hanukkah candles to the precious menorah that had belonged to her greatgrandmother , and though the candles tilted precariously , they maintained their balance while everyone stood around the table . Jill lit the shares and recited the prayer in her high , sweet voice . " Blessed art thou , 0 Lord our God , King of the Universe , who sanctified us by his commandments and commanded us to kindle the Hanukkah lights . " Aunt Gert chimed in for the next part : " Blessed art thou , 0 Lord our God , who has kept us in life and enabled us to reach this season . " Then she added , " And God willing , we should all be here next year to do this again . If you two are in Gennany , you can do it there . " One by one , as Jill 's graceful arm moved along the line of candles , the wicks took flame , proclaiming the miracle . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve , who brought the miracle grater , gets the first latke . " Janet watched her family lift their forks , and then she allowed herself a bite . The pancakes were crisp , delicious , exquisite to the tongue ; the addition of the golden applesauce , the rich sour cream , made them transcendent , heavenly . She hoped everyone at the table shared the feeling that was rising in her heart , that ultimately what mattered was not their differences , but their love for one another . " Good ? " Aunt Geri asked . But not one person could speak with such a full mouth . * Author Affiliation Merrill Joan Gerber has published 20 books , and her short stories have appeared in numerous magazines .
