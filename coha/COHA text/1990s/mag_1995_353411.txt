It was as if the Berlin Wall had never come down . Last week the House National Security Committee force-fed the Pentagon $553 million to start building more B-2 bombers , whose original mission was to wage nuclear war against the Soviet Union . Meanwhile , the Senate endorsed a budget blueprint , including a $1.5 billion payment on the Navy 's third Seawolf attack submarine , which was created to track and destroy the Soviet navy , and is now rusting at pier side . And the Army 's first rah-66 Comanche helicopter-designed to defeat Moscow 's Hokum helicopter-rolled out of a Connecticut factory attended by bunting , a military band and a real , befeathered Comanche chief . <P> As anxious advocates for the poor and elderly fight to stave off budget cuts , the Pentagon seems immune . 0ne would never know it , however , from the rhetoric wielded on behalf of Pentagon spending . " You could n't fight Desert Storm today , " House Speaker Newt Gingrich told TIME , despite Pentagon assertions that the U.S. military is now primed to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get people killed if we downsize much more . " <P> In fact , defense spending today is lapping close to its level during the cold war . The Pentagon proposes to spend 92 for every cold war dollar , once adjusted for inflation . The House committee last week recommended a $267 billion defense budget for next year , $9.5 billion more than Clinton is seeking . The Senate approved a budget resolution that mirrored Clinton 's defense request , and the final figure will probably split the difference and provide around $270 billion . But even Clinton 's sum is more , after adjusting for inflation , than the U.S. military spent annually in the mid- ' 50s and mid- ' 70s . <P> Even on its post-cold war diet , the U.S. military costs nearly as much as the rest of the world 's armies put together . " There 's no other country that has the requirements we 're confronted with , " says Defense Secretary William Perry . " Unless we 're willing to back off those requirements and go into an isolationist stance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> But this high ? Pulling back the curtain on the Pentagon 's battle plan discloses a patchwork of arbitrary decisions and inflated threats . In 1993 the Administration concluded that the U.S. military needed enough forces to win two " major regional contingencies , " each akin to the Persian Gulf War , at the same time . But there is growing sentiment in defense circles that the nation 's two-war strategy is wrong , at least in light of expected funding levels . " The two-war strategy is just a marketing device to justify a high budget , " says Pentagon cost analyst Franklin Spinney . A study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think tank , concludes that projected spending is " incapable of meeting " the two-war requirement .
