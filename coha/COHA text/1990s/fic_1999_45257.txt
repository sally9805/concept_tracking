Reynaldo descended from the train at Stazzioni S. Luccia and stood on the platform for a moment , lifted a handkerhief folded into a white square from his pocket and coughed quietly into it . He was a tall , slender man , clad in a white linen suit and silk necktie of a nougat hue . As he meticulously blotted his forehead , the light of the north Italian morning glinted off the lenses of his spectacles . He returned the handkerchief to his pocket and stepped out onto the riva , past the statue of the virgin offering its stone embrace to the stale air of the ferr . <p> His eye swept along the graceful lines of a gondola , its silver prow brilliant in the sunlight , which dappled the green water . The gondolier pushed off through a mooring gate of striped barber poles . The smell of sulphur and sewage lifted from the water . Reynaldo coughed into his handkerchief and wiped his lips , held the linen to his nostrils . <p> He followed the Grand Canal nearly to the Rialto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaporetto station , he paused and looked at a tall , slender woman who stood at the rail of the boat as it backed away into the canal . Her face was long and thin , her lower lip full , her teeth large and white . She wore a dark , tight dress , and her dark gaze lifted frankly to Reynaldo 's eyes as the vaporetto moved away from him . His eyes dropped to her fingers , long and delicate as porcelain , white as marble , on the railing . <p> His heart labored as he climbed the stairway away from the canal and made his way through the narrow streets toward the Church of St. John and St. Paul . By the time he reached the church , he was perspiring , and he stopped on the stone steps to blot his forehead and cheeks and coughed into his handkerchief . <p> Inside , monks in white robes swept the aisles silently with great dust mops . The beads that hung from the waist of one tall , slender , young monk clicked with the movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder at Reynaldo , peering up beneath his lowered brow with its curls of black hair flattened by perspiration . <p> Reynaldo hurried past him to the altar of St. Catherine of Sienna , where he blessed himself and knelt before the vigil tray . The bouquet of melting wax lifted to his nose as he gazed upon the Saint 's piede enshrined in a cylinder of brass and glass at the center of the altar . The flesh of the foot was white as fine marble but for the third toe , which had blackened at the second knuckle and across the nail . The big toe , however , was perfect , its nail finely shaped and of handsome length . The foot was not larger than that of a child 's . <p> He lowered his face and endeavored to pray , heard the clicking of beads and sweep of mop behind him , saw in his mind 's eye the monk 's gaze , the gaze of the dark woman from the vaporetto . He coughed into his handkerchief , rose abruptly from the kneeler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the equestrian statuary , the Virgin with the electric halo , the figure of a Venetian orator , an early Bellini . He could sense the white monk 's sweeping mop at his heels , heard the click of hip beads , heard or thought he heard a voice whisper , " Contanti per favore , signore . " He stepped quickly into the souvenir alcove and concealed himself behind a rack of postcard reproductions of religious scenes . A woman sat at a desk muttering and squealing quietly , her face a rash of tiny beige tubular warts . He found an exit past the desk and then he was out on the campo , beneath the lofty figure of the mercenary captain Bartolomeo on his bronze steed . <p> The sun had mounted the arch of the sky . Reynaldo loosened the knot of his tie and opened the button of his collar and started walking again . Just before he reached San Marco 's Piazza , in the corridor of a narrow damp stone walkway , he had to stop to catch his breath and lean on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he muffled it in his handkerchief , peering at the red stain he left there . A long procession of Japanese tourists filed past him , following a woman who held aloft a large slice of artificial watermelon on a stick . One of the men , dressed in a dark suit and wearing many leather cases on straps slung round his neck and shoulders , smiled and bowed and took Reynaldo 's picture from three angles . The man then motioned to two women , an older and younger one , and uttered a guttural command . The women put their small hands over their mouths and tittered , then posed on either side of Reynaldo as the Japanese gentleman smiled and bowed and took more photos . He handed Reynaldo a printed card , bowed again and smiled , spat another command at the two women , and rejoined the procession following the watermelon slice . <p> Reynaldo looked at the card . Printed in Gothic script was the legend " Foto Joe Yamagoochi . Preserve moments of big importance in commemorative fotos to survive the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number and a Tokyo address . <p> Reynaldo slipped the card into his pocket and continued down the alley to the square . On San Marco , he sat at one of the outdoor tables . A waiter , immaculate in gold-brocaded white , approached and bowed crisply . " Prego , signore . " <p> " Water , please . A glass of plain water . " <p> The waiter shot his cuffs , retreated , returned bearing a glass that he set down with a sharp report before Reynaldo . " Fongula , " he muttered quietly and presented a check for three thousand lire . Reynaldo paid and sat drinking his water in small sips as the afternoon sun bore down on his bare scalp . <p> A human fly was scaling the wall of the high red brick campanile while atop the opposite tower two green bronze figures of Moors struck bells with bronze hammers . All across the plaza , tourists sucked ices , fed pigeons , snapped photographs of one another , strolled . A sign on the steps of the San Marco church said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a raised platform at the center of the cafe tables , a string quartet began to play . Suddenly , Reynaldo was hungry , very hungry . He gestured furiously to the waiter . " Una fugassa , per favore . " <p> " Prego , signore . " <p> The waiter brought a slice of the gaudy cake and Reynaldo ate it quickly , licking his lips and fingers and fork and swallowing his water greedily . At once , he was filled with remorse , called for his check and was required to pay an extra five thousand lire for the music . <p> He rose and began walking again . <p> He climbed slowly up over a bridge to the mainland and continued through the narrow street toward the sea . On the Calle S. Gregorio , he watched one of the ancient line of Venetian glassblowers ply his art , holding a glass in the flame , shaping slowly and meticulously a figure of Mickey Mouse , which he placed alongside a row of similar figures while a crowd of tourists spoke hushed exclamations of praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch a small cloud of flies struggling for a place on a fallen ice cream cone that was slowly melting into a sewer grating . The song of a gondolier drew his attention . The gondola drifted past in the water with the dark-clad woman seated across its bench in the position of the naked maja , one hand over her sex , flowers framed round her head , lips open to show her smile of long teeth . Reynaldo felt nothing . The woman 's gaze was piercing , mocking . She folded her hands across her breast , lowered her eyelids . <p> He stood on the Fundamente Novo Ponte and stared across the water to the Isola di S. Michele and the trees and stones of the cemetery . The shadows lengthened along the narrow streets as he made his way to the tip of the lagoon and stood in a knot of tourists looking at the water . As he walked back toward the Rialto , a gondola slid past in which an aging Italian tenor in a silver suit , shirt opened at the breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O Solo Mio to a group of Japanese tourists . Reynaldo recognized in the boat the man named Foto Joe Yamagoochi . The Japanese man waved at him and smiled and his two women tittered behind their fingers . <p> A mosquito stung Reynaldo 's earlobe . He slapped furiously at it . Suddenly , he felt very tired . <p> Many elbows jostled him as he climbed the steps of the Rialto and descended the opposite side again . The waters of the canal were dark as oil now , the winding passage through the building fronts quiet and mysterious except for the song of aging gondolier tenors and the occasional smatter of applause . <p> As Reynaldo stood peering up at the Bridge of Sighs , he felt a hand slip into his pocket and remove his billfold . He turned to see a dark head disappearing into the flow of the crowd , opened his mouth to call out , but coughed instead and groped into his pocket for his handkerchief . His back , beneath his shirt and jacket , was clammy with perspiration . His temples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed his eyes and called forth the image of the foot of St. Catherine in its sleeve of glass and yellow metal . Quickly , he made his way down the bridge , across the plaza , through the narrow damp streetway . Presently he came upon the plaza of the church of St. John and St. Paul . The sun was gone behind the bricks around him now , and the plaza was empty of tourists . <p> In the church , the white-robed monks all sat in a phalanx before the Madonna with electric halo , muttering prayers . Their backs were to him as he stepped quietly along the marble floor to the opposite side of the church and knelt before the altar of St. Catherine . His heart stopped beating as he reached to the centerpiece on the altar , felt with his fingers around to the back of the glass , located the catch and hinge and opened the cylinder . The flesh of the dead foot was strange against his palm as he lifted it from the altar and deposited it , still in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The monks were still muttering their prayers as Reynaldo hastened on the balls of his feet to the doors of the church , let himself out and crossed the campo again , hurrying toward San Marco . At the mouth of the long narrow streetway , he saw a figure , haloed in the light from behind . He approached slowly . As his eyes became accustomed to the darkness , he recognized the long , thin face , the teeth , the smile . Her eyes were closed as she reached toward him . He pressed his back to the wall to slip past her , but her hand touched his sleeve , and he had no strength to go further . She moved close to him , placed her lips against his ear and whispered a single word , his name , the last syllables of it . " Naldo , " she whispered . " Naldo . " <p> " Yes , " he whispered back . <p> Then her face was before him , moving closer , her mouth before his , so close that his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the walkway , anyone looking in would have seen the double-backed figure of young lovers in embrace , a common sight in the city of lovers . <p> He was cold as he left her . His lips were cold , his cheeks , as he limped toward the mouth of the narrow streetway to San Marcos , as he left the quiet and dark to emerge onto the crowded plaza . His hand was still inside his jacket , still grasping the remains of the Saint . He threaded through the crowd to the clock tower , entered the door and began to climb . The ascent was difficult . His power was fading . He paused many times to cough into his handkerchief , to wait for his lungs to subside , to sigh and wait for strength . At length , he emerged atop the tower , stepped out beside the green bronze figures of the Moors with their long hammers , standing mutely beside the green bronze bell casings . He stepped to the edge of the tower and looked across to the campanile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the island into the marshy depths . His toes overlapped the edge of the tower . He peered down at the masses of people in gaudy clothing thronging to purchase ices , drinks , shiny mementoes of a place that no longer existed ; tiny as pigeons , they strutted and clucked . He drew the foot from within his jacket , shuddered lightly as he gazed upon it in the pale evening light . Across the plaza he saw a whole block of buildings tremble . He heard a siren wail out across the water , heard voices in sudden confusion and fear rising up through the narrow alleys . He heard a wall crumble , screaming , heard the echo of a tenor in a gondola . <p> He put the arch of the foot to his lips and took another step , then another , and the floor of the plaza exploded into his face . <p>
