LORENZO sits in the threshold of the house . SID , in the present , as a man of 85 , comes by and sees him . SID pushes a Lucky 's shopping cart filled with burned books . His hands are bandaged . His clothes are covered with soot . SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL You look lonely sitting there . I always have company because I always have these . This is my favorite one . ( HE opens an old copy of a book of short stories by Borges , with yellow , fragile pages and reads . ) " Any life , no matter how long or complex it may be , is made up essentially of a single moment  --  the moment in which a man finds out , once and for all , who he is .

On a street in 1940s Hollywood , a movie theater is burning . The movie advertised on the marquee is " MEXICAN SPITFIRE SEES A GHOST " starring Lupe Velez . SID , dressed as RITA HAYWORTH incognito  --  with dark glasses , a yellow dress and scarf , blue shoes with a matching largeish blue purse  --  watches the flames while eating an ice cream cone . SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL ( Putting his right index finger , which is burned , into the ice cream which HE talks to ) I did not enjoy that movie . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood are ghosts funny . In life , they hardly ever make you laugh . Oops ! You are so messy , Mr. Vanilla . ( Looks into his purse and pulls out a tissue to wipe the dripping ice cream from his lips and hand , then looks at the fire and laughs ) People who are burning look like little mice to me ! All crawling on the ground as fast as they can . Searching for air off the sidewalks . Like animals in a burning forest . And the sound of their coughing and gagging  --  it 's like a symphony . It begins pianissimo and leads to a crescendo and then ends in a punctuated note  --  the death rattle , low and rumbling from the back of their throats . Their vocal cord muscles twitching like the strings of a first cello . Ouch ! ( Looking at his finger ) I broke a nail too . The damage one match can do . Must have been hotter than I thought . Now I need a manicure . I like manicures , but pedicures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the little cottons between the toes and the gentle grinding away of those nasty hard bits of toenails . I have my mother 's feet . Her nails were so hard that my father had to use poultry shears to cut them . He never did my feet like that , but I wanted him too . ( The sound of ambulances , fire engines , sirens . ) Too soon . Nothing 's falling yet  --  ( The sign begins to crumble and the marquee letters begin to fall . HE picks a few up . ) A souvenir . ( HE puts the letters in his purse and snaps it smartly closed . ) There . Now I just need an " N. " Tomorrow I 'll go to the east side and see " Las Abandonadas . " ( Lights cross to MR .

MEDINA sits in the family room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEDINA enters with a bowl of ice cream and berries . SHE hands it to him . MR . MEDINA Do n't we have any red berries ? I hate blueberries . Blackberries are n't my favorite either But I do n't mind strawberries or raspberries  --  or even cherries . Do n't we have any cherries ? MRS . MEDINA No . No cherries . I can go to the store . MR . MEDINA That 's all right . Do n't go to any trouble . I can eat around the blueberries MRS . MEDINA I do n't mind . MR . MEDINA Forget it . MRS . MEDINA Please let me  --  MR . MEDINA ( Pulling her roughly down beside him ) Sit . MRS . MEDINA I got a gun yesterday . MR . MEDINA Did you ? How come ? MRS . MEDINA I 'm scared . MR . MEDINA Of what ? MRS . MEDINA I do n't know . MR . MEDINA It 's in your mind . Fear is self-generated . Like failure . Courage and success come from within . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheperd is simply stupid . p. 15 MRS . MEDINA You keep saying that  --  and I 'd like to believe you . But  --  I do n't . Sheep are very sweet . MR . MEDINA Especially lambs and so nourishing . Our savior 's last supper was lamb . Did you know that ? MRS . MEDINA Lamb tastes funny to me . Like flowers . So aromatic . It 's one of the foods I can feel strongly in my nose  --  like onions . MR . MEDINA And like onions they make you cry ? MRS . MEDINA Do n't . MR . MEDINA And like the sound of bedroom doors closing , it keeps you awake . Awake in fear . I 'm not like you  --  I have no trouble sleeping . MRS . MEDINA Try sleeping at home sometime . ( MR . MEDINA slaps her . ) MR . MEDINA Do n't try to tell me what to do . MRS . MEDINA I 'm just jealous because you can always sleep . I do n't care about anything else anymore . MR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

LALY , dressed in a blue tap dance outfit , sits on the staircase waiting for Peggy or the DIRECTOR to call , phone on her lap . SHE has been drinking and waiting for a long time . LALY LOPEZ Liars . Margo was right . That 's why there 's earthquakes here  --  All the lying showbiz scumbags ! I bet if they lined up all the liars , end to end , you could reach all the way down the earth . Past Mexico and Chile , through Brazil all the way to Argentina . That 's what I bet . All the way to jodida Argentina . Todo est jodido . Estamos jodidas en jodido Hollywood . ( MARGO is dressed in an identical tap dance outfit , but hers is yellow . SHE stumbles out and almost falls into LALY 's lap . ) Ouchie ! MARGO LOPEZ ( Semi-drunkenly , but playfully ) Sana , sana culito de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LALY LOPEZ Go to sleep . ( MARGO makes a sound of disgust . ) No ? Then eat something and stop singing about a frog 's ass . MARGO LOPEZ ( Making another sound of disgust ) Oooey ? ! Why you say such weird things ? LALY LOPEZ What do you mean weird ? p. 17 MARGO LOPEZ Strange , mysterious , wrong-sounding  --  LALY LOPEZ Those are much better words than plain old weird . What 's that ? ! That could mean anything . ( More gently ) Are you sure you 're not hungry ? I 'm always hungry when I 'm hungover . It 's like all the alcohol is a sauce at the bottom of my stomach and I got ta have some bread in there to sop it up or it 'll get all rotten and then I 'll feel like throwing up . MARGO LOPEZ Oooey ! ( Pause ) Got any sandwiches left ? LALY LOPEZ No . MARGO LOPEZ Even my half esandwich de pernil ? LALY LOPEZ You ate your half  --  most of it anyway .

LALY LOPEZ ( Jokingly ) That 's perfect ! We could be the Pendeja Sisters  --  like the Dolly Sisters , or the Andrew Sisters  --  but with an edge ! p. 18 MARGO LOPEZ That 's not nice  --  to call yourself that . I do n't want to be nobody 's private hair anymore . LALY LOPEZ You wan na dance . MARGO LOPEZ Yes . And sing . LALY LOPEZ Of course . ( Pause ) But they did n't call . ( Pause ) Not this time but somebody else will . Like Papi would say , " over spill-ded milk you better don ' bleed . " MARGO LOPEZ I can make my feet bleed when I dance . I got this one little blister on my little toe of my left foot , and it bleeds with the right kind of pressure . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stockings stick so weird to you when you bleed . LALY LOPEZ What d' ya mean weird ? MARGO LOPEZ Weird . Strange . Unusual . Creepyish . You know  --  weird . LALY LOPEZ Lupe 's the best . MARGO LOPEZ But Dolores Del Rio has style . The dresses , the hair , the lips . What 's Lupe got ? LALY LOPEZ All that  --  plus great comic timing . She woulda been great in vaudeville  --  MARGO LOPEZ Except she 's too Spanish . p. 19 LALY LOPEZ She 's not Spanish , she 's Mexican . MARGO LOPEZ Yeah , I know but she speaks eSpanishly . You know what I mean . Like she never got rid of her accent . Bad news when the talkies came around . You know what I mean  --  I know you do . Do n't look at me like that . LALY LOPEZ Like what ? MARGO LOPEZ Like I 'm estupid . LALY LOPEZ Sometimes you ca n't help what look you give people . Sometimes your insides come out , showing what you truly think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your life . MARGO LOPEZ You look at me like you 'd like to kill me sometimes . Do you think that 's nice ? LALY LOPEZ No . MARGO LOPEZ Then why do you do it ? LALY LOPEZ Habit . Old habits are hard to  --  MARGO LOPEZ Do n't say it . LALY LOPEZ Should we practice ? MARGO LOPEZ No . LALY LOPEZ What if we forget  --  MARGO LOPEZ We wo n't you might , but I 'll cover for you . p. 20 LALY LOPEZ Yeah . Right . ( Pause ) MARGO LOPEZ You think he 's proud of us ?

LALY LOPEZ He did n't give us money  --  he died and we took the money that he left behind . That 's all . He would n't never have given us that money if we asked him . MARGO LOPEZ Sure he woulda . He loves  --  loved us . Papi loved us . LALY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I love those Mexican movies . Dolores always looks so in love .

Are you coming ? LALY LOPEZ Yeah . In a minute . MARGO LOPEZ You want a sweater ? ( LALY nods " No " and MARGO shrugs her shoulders and goes in . LALY takes a gun out of the pocket of her skirt . The subtitle screen reads : " Anoche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candado , t no sirves para amores , tienes el sueo pesado . " ) LALY LOPEZ At least I got this to remember my first audition with . People are so careless with props . I would never be like that . I would watch over all my things . I 'm a director 's dream . ( SHE puts the gun to her head and acts out a suicide scene she saw once in a movie western . As SHE speaks , her words are translated from Spanish into English on the subtitle screen . All the subtitled sections are in italics . ) I would never let you take me , Johnny . Not like this . With the priest being dead and all , I ca n't marry you and I would never  --  could never spit on my mother 's grave by being with you without the blessed sacrament of marriage . You 'll find another . One who 'll love you even more.No , Johnny ! As no ! No podemos sin casarnos . El cura est muerto . Y mam tambien . Me dijo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me casara . Tu vas a encontrar otra mujer  --  una que te quiera mas que yo . ( SHE closes her eyes and begins to pull the trigger , but then suddenly opens her eyes . ) Yes , Johnny . I know there are other priests in other towns , but I ca n't leave my mother 's grave unattended . It was my promise to her.Si , Johnny . S que hay otros curas en otros pueblos , pero no puedo dejar la sepultura de mam . Le hice una promesa . ( SHE closes her eyes again and then opens them . ) That 's right ! You could bring another priest here to Santa Mara de la Pursima . Right here , in our own little  --  but , Johnny , if you leave , you know the bandidos will come and rape me . They like to do that . Son animals ! Es verdad ! Puedes traer un cura aqu mismo , a Santa Mara de la Pursima  --  pero si me dejas sola aqu , los bandidos me haran dao .

En vez de decirte adis , digo hasta la vista Nos veremos en el cielo , Johnny . ( SID applauds , startling LALY , who jumps back . ) Coo ! p. 22 SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL ( In his RITA voice ) Sorry , honey . I did n't mean to scare you , but that was quite a performance . Might be even better , if you pulled the trigger . There 's just so much the camera can do . Then it 's up to you . ( HE walks off . ) LALY LOPEZ Sangana ! Does n't anybody sleep in this town ? ! ( SHE looks at the gun , wondering for a moment if it could be real . ) Hmm it 's scary how real some things look . But I guess that 's the beauty of the movies . Got ta make people believe what they see .

Did his eyes and mouth fill up after the shots  --  ( The sound of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtitle screen reads : " A slip of the tongue is worse than a slip of a foot . " ) p. 24 LORENZO MEDINA No . He picked up two hustlers who suffocated him with a lead dildo . Can you imagine that ? After all he went through . All he survived  --  from Latin star to just another dead spick . It 's a shame really . ( Pause ) EFRAIN MEDINA Where 'd they get a lead dildo ? LORENZO MEDINA It was Ramon 's . Rudy Valentino signed it in silver and gave it to him . EFRAIN MEDINA Oh . People need to be careful with gifts . LORENZO MEDINA Yes . You have to be careful who you let touch your toys . ( LORENZO moves to look out a window and EFRAIN follows him .

LORENZO MEDINA Ours will be haunted soon . EFRAIN MEDINA Some ghosts follow you . ( Pause ) LORENZO MEDINA Maybe a restaurant ? Would n't that be better ? A good investment always makes sense .

The brothers watch transfixed until THEY tango off. ) p. 27 MARGO LOPEZ ( Doing an imitation of Bette Davis ) What a dump ! LALY LOPEZ It 's not that bad . He 's a bachelor you know .

LALY hangs back and watches RAMON . ) RAMON NOVARRO ( Picking up the lead dildo and speaking to it ) I miss you most at times like these , when I 'm alone and feeling sorry for myself . Most people would have given me a photo to remember them by but you were always different , Rudy . Still so different than the rest . The new ones . The ones who come here . Looking for what ? To be a star in the cinema verit  --  en las peliculas mas grandes con actores famosos y llenas de las palabras de amor . I do n't get to speak words of love anymore  --  not in the movies . I have to play doctors now then maitre d 's  --  and finally at the end of my career  --  train conductors or maybe drunks in bus or train stations . When Hollywood chooses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need is quiet . A warm back folded into my front and quiet . ( Pause as HE closes his eyes ) I never sleep anymore . I just yearn for his face , my eyes closed , searching in the darkness . Looking inside myself to find that place where he lives again . Such a stupid way to die . He neglected his own body  --  never followed the warnings . You have to listen to the sounds of your own pain sometimes . Mine never leave me alone . ( Pause ; HE opens his eyes ) I never really danced until I danced a tango with Rudy . I bring him a red rose once a year , but I wear a veil so no one knows . And before I place it on his grave , I hold it in my teeth to remember  --  to taste the sweet grass wetness of him again , like a forest after a summer rain . One petal I save for myself  --  its velvet touch like two lips meeting in a whisper . ( RAMON kisses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes as the lights cross to LALY hiding in the shadows . MARGO comes out of the kitchen and discovers LALY spying on RAMON . The subtitle screen reads : " Se calent el horno. " ) p. 31 MARGO LOPEZ What are you doing ? LALY LOPEZ Nothing . MARGO LOPEZ People get arrested for tomming peeps like that ! What if he was to catch you . Laly ? What would you do then ? Do n't you got no sense ? LALY LOPEZ You 're the one with no sense ! Doing nothing but following me around all the time . MARGO LOPEZ I follow you around because I love you . Family should n't be apart . You 're all I got left . LALY LOPEZ Go somewhere . Meet somebody . Have a baby . Make your own family , Margo . I do n't got room in my heart for you . MARGO LOPEZ You don ' mean that . I know you do n't . Why are you like this ? I don'unnerstan ' you no more . LALY LOPEZ I got things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . ( MARGO runs off crying . ) Do n't leave now ! You 're the one who knows how to cook . Now what am I going to do ? ( RAMON stops MARGO . EFRAIN comes running down the stairs and MRS . MEDINA follows him and stops him . RAMON speaks to MARGO and MRS . MEDINA speaks to EFRAIN . ) RAMON AND MRS . MEDINA Dance with me . MARGO AND EFRAIN I ca n't . Not now . p. 32 RAMON AND MRS . MEDINA Later then . Maybe I 'll throw a party . I used to give good parties once . ( EFRAIN &amp; MARGO break loose and run out the front door . Lights cross to LALY in the the kitchen . ) LALY LOPEZ I always pick the wrong fight . ( Pause ) But that 's because my head 's not right . That 's something Margo should understand since it 's about love . When I was a little girl , Papi took me to see " Ben-Hur , " and I fell in love . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . " No , Papi . I 'm Laly . " I kept saying that to him but he did n't listen . His hands  --  they did n't hurt me at all . All through that movie , I could look up and see Novarro 's beautiful face and nothing hurt me even though he made me bleed . Because I could forget . In Ramon 's eyes , I could drown and become a part of him . That 's how I want to go . ( Pause ) Damn that Margo ! It 's always when I want her to stay that she disappears . Family always gets in the way . ( MARGO re-enters . The subtitle screen reads : " Una mano lava la otra y las dos lavan la cara . " ) MARGO LOPEZ I 'm sorry . LALY LOPEZ That makes two of us . MARGO LOPEZ I wish I did n't love you so much sometimes . I hate that feeling . p. 33 LALY LOPEZ Me too . ( THEY embrace . ) Let 's get to work okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Novarro needs anything . MARGO LOPEZ On top of everything , Laly , don'you start ordering me around . I 'm doing you a favor . LALY LOPEZ I know , but just this once help me without a fight , okay ? And I wo n't ask you to do anything for me ever again . MARGO LOPEZ I 'll help you alright , but I know it 's not the last time . ( Pause ) Why are you so mean to me ? LALY LOPEZ Because I do n't know any other way to be . ( Lights cross to SID entering RAMON 's house still dressed as RITA incognito. ) p. 34 Act 1 , Scene 6 ACT ONE : SCENE 6 SID enters dresses as RITA incognito . HE is trying to sneak up the stairs without RAMON hearing him , but RAMON catches him , drunkenly pulling on his dress until it tears . RAMON NOVARRO Darling ! SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL Que animal ! RAMON NOVARRO Do n't . Do n't call me that . You know how much I love you . ( HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL Let go of me . I have to change now . RAMON NOVARRO Yes . You 'll catch cold walking around in the night like that . SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL It 's afternoon . ( SID turns and tries to walk away , but RAMON grabs his hand . ) RAMON NOVARRO You know what I love best about you ? Your fingers . ( HE begins to kiss and lick each of SID 's fingers . ) They taste like old sweet milk  --  like the orchatas my mother used to make for me . ( SID submits to RAMON 's caresses . ) You taste so good . So sweet . Dedos as dulces como tu leche . Ay , se me puso dura . Tcame . Dejame tocarte , ngel . ( HE pushes SID down on the stairs and gets on his back and begins to masturbate him from behind . Again , SID submits , but this time it hurts . ) You like it this way , do n't you ? Like you 're doing it to yourself except you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pull so hard ! I 'm not a parachute . RAMON NOVARRO Ay ! Ohhh ! Ay , si ! Ay , Rudy , si . Que pija ! Quiero mamarte ! Quiero beber tu leche , angelito . AY ! ( RAMON comes . SID pushes him off and covers himself with his torn dress and scarf . RAMON lays panting on the stairs . Lights cross with SID to the threshold of RAMON 's door . SID sits and lights a cigar . The subtitle screen reads : " TENER BIGOTES " . ) SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL I do n't care what he does to me . As long as he pays my salary , he can do anything he wants . It does n't hurt me . Why would it hurt me ? I 'm not ashamed of what I do . I like driving him around . It gives me power . I could take a turn too fast one day and then where would he be ? Some big movie star . Ramon Splat Novarro . Everybody 's the same when their body loses heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die from different things , they still lose ten degrees every hour after the heart stops . I know that because my father was a doctor back home . He was a great doctor until he ran someone over . He could n't do much after that  --  except cry . He could cry at any moment . Everything got too hard for him . I think he was crazy , but we did n't know it because he was the doctor . There was no one else around to diagnose him . I was just a little boy then . Anyway , he 's dead now . But I think if he was n't dead , I 'd have taken after him . It 's hard to take after the dead . He used to haunt me . But not anymore . I went to a witch who gave me some belladonna and told me to put it on my prick so I could exorcise the spirit of my father . ( HE takes a puff on his cigar . ) It turned out to be poison oak . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they do . And it worked anyway . I stopped seeing him in my dreams but I did get the urge to drive a car . ( Pause ) This was my favorite dress . ( Pause ) I have to wash him off me . ( HE takes another puff and puts the cigar out on the wall beside him . Then HE exits and the lights cross to the present , where MR. &amp; MRS . MEDINA are sitting on the couch. ) p. 36 p. 37 Act 1 , Scene 7 ACT ONE : SCENE 7 The present , minutes before the murder . Lights cross to MR. &amp; MRS . MEDINA sitting on the couch . They are still eating ice cream and are illuminated by the tv light . MR . MEDINA That 's the last time I let you pick the movie . MRS . MEDINA I thought you were asleep . MR . MEDINA I would have been better off sleeping . MRS . MEDINA I thought it was good . Kind of touching . MR . MEDINA I would rather shoot myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stupid whore in it . MRS . MEDINA She 's not stupid . She just acts dumb . Because it made her money . If it made her money , she could n't have been that dumb . MR . MEDINA But she gave us a bad name . All Latinas are not going around all loud and sex-crazed like that . MRS . MEDINA If they were you 'd know about it . MR . MEDINA What 's that supposed to mean ? MRS . MEDINA Nothing . MR . MEDINA I 'm too tired to have this fight . Ca n't you be nice ? Ca n't you just agree with me and keep quiet ? p. 38 MRS . MEDINA But  --  MR . MEDINA Ssssh ! MRS . MEDINA Okay Sing me a song . ( THEY snuggle together both with their eyes closed . ) MR . MEDINA I 'm too tired . I 'll let my fingers do the singing . ( HE reaches out for the remote control , turns on the stereo , it plays Gardel 's " Rubias de Nueva York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary , Peggy , Betty , Julie , Rubias de New York , cabecitas " LORENZO &amp; EFRAIN burst through the door , dressed in their tennis whites , holding shotguns . ) MR . MEDINA We should have had girls . ( Blackout . The sound of gunshots , running feet . Lights up on MARGO &amp; LALY , in blonde wigs , dancing to " Rubias de Nueva York " la Fred &amp; Ginger . THEY dance until the end of the song . From offstage , RAMON speaks . ) RAMON NOVARRO I do n't know , girls . I think maybe just cook us a nice meal and we 'll entertain ourselves , okay ? ( Pause ) Oh , and lose the wigs . ( LALY runs to the kitchen sink , holding her mouth . MARGO follows close behind . Lights cross to EFRAIN &amp; LORENZO kneeling before the coffee table . It 's the present , minutes after the murder . LORENZO is watching a mexican Lupe Velez movie on t.v. , NANA . The bloody dead bodies of their parents rest behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream with what looks like cherries . Their tennis whites are thickly-stained with blood . The subtitle screen reads : " Bocado sin hueso. " ) p. 39 LORENZO MEDINA This is good with cherries . EFRAIN MEDINA Those are n't cherries . LORENZO MEDINA Yes , they are . See ? ( HE holds up a spoonful of pink mess . ) Cherries . EFRAIN MEDINA She does n't keep cherries in the house . She 's allergic . LORENZO MEDINA Oh . ( Pause ) Tastes good whatever it is . EFRAIN MEDINA How can you eat that ? It was theirs . LORENZO MEDINA Oh . ( Pause ; HE looks closely at the ice cream . ) Oh , well . Still tastes good . EFRAIN MEDINA I slipped over there , on her foot . I tripped right over it . LORENZO MEDINA I would think you 'd be more careful . What a great movie . I learned about sex from that book . " Nana " was pretty hot . I wonder if all Parisian streetwalkers are like that I mean , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody 's truth anyway . ( THEY watch the movie together in silence . ) LORENZO MEDINA Hey , she was pretty good . I thought she only did comedies. p. 40 EFRAIN MEDINA Me too . LORENZO MEDINA I gave you that book , did n't I ? ( EFRAIN nods " yes " . THEY continue to watch in silence . LORENZO turns off the lights so the only light is the flicker of T.V. light . Then HE moves close to EFRAIN and places a hand on EFRAIN 's thigh . ) LORENZO MEDINA ( Referring to the ice cream ) Want some of this ? It 's hardly melted at all . You 'd think all that smoke would get inside and make it soft  --  but it 's still hard . Amazing must be movie ice cream ! ( Laughs at his own joke ) Or maybe that astronaut ice cream . EFRAIN MEDINA That stuff lasts forever LORENZO MEDINA I love being your brother . ( Handing EFRAIN the charred Hollywood book from the prologue ) Here 's another book for you . ( EFRAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t.v. to catch the light . HE opens the book and begins to read . ) EFRAIN MEDINA I love looking at all these people . Look at her . A real beauty . But that name that means pain . Pain del Rio  --  Pain of the river . What 's that about ? Parents should think about the names they give their children . p. 41 LORENZO MEDINA Did n't hurt her career any . EFRAIN MEDINA That 's because she went back home to make most of her movies . Good career move . LORENZO MEDINA Good research too . I 'm proud of you . You 're really getting into it . Did you  --  EFRAIN MEDINA Mom had a dress just like this one . Man , she really loved parties . Especially the dress up ones . " This is how you build your pride in Hollywood , baby , " she would tell me . ( MR. &amp; MRS . MEDINA enter dressed as RAMON and MARLENE who are in their movie star clothes , except these are soaked with blood . EFRAIN hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEDINA talks directly to him . ) MRS . MEDINA When you dress like a movie star , you understand success . People treat you like you 're somebody because you 're pretending to be somebody . Your father does Ramon Novarro because Ramon was the most beautiful man in Hollywood then  --  and your father looks just like him  --  so beautiful . MR . MEDINA Yes , everybody 's beautiful . Ca n't you wait until we get to the party to start drinking ? MRS . MEDINA And I do Marlene because she 's someone I know would understand me . Her eyes , so dreamy and seductive but she carried a gun  --  and she knew how to steal a man and how to keep him . Like I did . I stole your father from that witch , my sister Marta . She thought she had him sewn up like a new tennis ball . But then I came , I saw , I conquered , baby . Hmmm ! Did n't I , honey ? p. 42 MR . MEDINA Yes , honey . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turn around , boys . ( Only EFRAIN turns around to show his back ) Look , honey . That 's true beauty . Beauty in their spines  --  so straight . Hard , cold spines , like your Papi . I taught you all the important things . You know when to turn your back and when to not , do n't you ? Do n't you ? EFRAIN MEDINA ( Terrified ) Yes , Papi , yes ! ! LORENZO MEDINA Not again It 's over , Efrain . It 's done with . We 're writing new chapters to our lives now . We can bring friends to our house now . We can each have our own house . Finally , there 's a home within our reach . I told you about reaching . I told you about planning . I told you about justice . I ca n't make it any simpler . How can I get you to understand . Stop crying ! Your eyes are swelling up . You look like shit now . We wo n't be able to go . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This party is our alibi . EFRAIN MEDINA I 'm sorry . LORENZO MEDINA I know . MR . MEDINA You 're the worst one . You want to make him crazy . You want it all for yourself you little bastard , but it 's not going to work . His spine is stronger than yours . I know that for a fact . For a fact , I know him more . You had things on your skin always . Things that made me nervous , made me sick to touch you . You had disease on you . I had an uncle back in Argentina , who had skin like that . He was in a circus . They called him " El Caimn "  --  the Alligator Man . He was a freak . He was a freak like you 'll always be  --  no matter how much you buy . p. 43 LORENZO MEDINA That 's a lie . You 're a liar . You lied to everyone . And I do n't have to listen anymore . ( LORENZO begins to exit . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love Again " la DIETRICH . ) MRS . MEDINA " Falling in love again , never wanted to . What am I to do ? Ca n't help it . " LORENZO MEDINA I swoon when I hear that song . ( HE pulls EFRAIN to his feet and begins to dance with him as MR. &amp; MRS . MEDINA dance and MRS . MEDINA keeps humming . ) LORENZO MEDINA ( Kissing EFRAIN gently on the forehead , leaving lipstick marks ) There . All better ? ( EFRAIN nods . ) We better get dressed . EFRAIN MEDINA Yes . We better go . We 're late for dinner . It 's rude to be late for dinner . LORENZO MEDINA Yes . Plus I do n't know about you , but I 'm starved ! ( Lights down on LORENZO &amp; EFRAIN , but they stay up on MR. &amp; MRS . MEDINA . As THEY dance , red feathers float down and cover them like snow . ) MRS . MEDINA ( Singing ) " Love 's always been my game , play it while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help it.Men cluster to me like moths around a flame and if their wings burn I know I 'm not to blame . " p. 44 MR. &amp; MRS . MEDINA ( Singing together ) " Falling in love again , never wanted to , what are we to do . We just ca n't help it . " ( MR . MEDINA kisses her neck . SHE sighs loudly . ) EFRAIN MEDINA Let 's buy something soon I 'll feel better when we do that . ( EFRAIN runs out the front door to throw up . LORENZO follows slowly after him , sighing his disapproval . ) LORENZO MEDINA I loved the place we saw today . It 's a place with a past . I like that . ( Pause ) Do n't spend too much time out there . We have to shower and do my hair . ( The violent sound of vomiting . Lights cross to LALY and MARGO in the kitchen. ) p. 45 Act 1 , Scene 8 ACT ONE : SCENE 8 LALY is vomiting into the kitchen sink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARGO LOPEZ That 's it ! We 're getting out of here ! Just because he do n't want us to sing  --  LALY LOPEZ No , please Margo . It 's just that I 'm so nervous MARGO LOPEZ That 's why we should go . It 's making you sick to be here . LALY LOPEZ ( Rinsing out her mouth ) No it 's not . I 'm fine now . What should we make ? MARGO LOPEZ ( Looking in the fridge ) There 's no food in here . Just  --  ( Pulls out a bottle of vodka and a bottle of gin. ) these LALY LOPEZ Oh , well we can just call one of those grocery stores in Beverly Hills . They give credit to the stars . I read about it in Modern Screen . MARGO LOPEZ Wow , really ? It pays to be broke sometimes . LALY LOPEZ ( Looking incredulously at MARGO ) Do we share both parents , or what ? ! You 're a pip , Sis . A real pip . MARGO LOPEZ Thanks . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're coming ! All of them . Dinner for five , girls . The moon is full and  --  ( At a loss for a good metaphor ) and so will they be  --  after eating your food . You cook good , right ? LALY LOPEZ Great . MARGO LOPEZ Actually , we do n't  --  ( LALY elbows her. ) ever do anything else . Cook , cook , cook . What do we do ? ! We cook ! RAMON NOVARRO Good . LALY LOPEZ Who are we expecting ? RAMON NOVARRO Lupe and Rita . Marlene and Dolores . And , uhm there 's one other person MARGO LOPEZ You ? RAMON NOVARRO Yes , of course . But also Sid . I call him El Cid . He 's adorable . But if Rita comes he wo n't come . LALY LOPEZ So six for dinner altogether . Or is that five ? RAMON NOVARRO Theoretically , yes . But I do n't eat at my own parties . It 's a tradition . The exhaustion of good hosting should always rob you of your appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's so refined ! p. 47 RAMON NOVARRO ( Chucking her under her chin ) I know . LALY LOPEZ ( Girlishly , with a giggle ; MARGO mocks her silently , repeating her words while making ridiculous faces . ) Oh , Mr. Novarro ! ( LALY catches MARGO imitating her out of the corner of her eye and pinches her . ) MARGO LOPEZ Ouchie ! ! RAMON NOVARRO Save it for later , girls you might need it . ( HE laughs and exits . ) MARGO LOPEZ What do you think he means by that ? LALY LOPEZ Call the store already , will you ? ! I have to brush my hair . MARGO LOPEZ What about my hair ? ! LALY LOPEZ You do n't care about these things like I do . You 're a natural beauty . MARGO LOPEZ That 's true . ( MARGO crosses to the phone . Lights cross to EFRAIN on the couch with his dead mother . HE is trying to comb her blood-matted hair . The subtitle screen reads : " Each monkey on his string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Combs are hard on the knots . You always end up yanking what you mean to smooth out  --  but it comes out on your comb , in chunks  --  I mean , clumps , of hair . It 's so cool , you know , how you have hardly any gray for somebody your age . Everybody says so . My friends all think you 're so young to have an old boy like me . Good skin . Noxzema and Pond 's did for you what Lancome does for Isabella Rossellini . Just proves you do n't need money  --  right ? I mean to have a good complexion . You were always so thrifty . Never spent an extra dime on yourself , saved it all , you and pa . Saved it all for us . What college do you think I should go to ? Lorenzo thinks Harvard , but I 'd like something more counter-cultural , like Brown or Berkeley , or maybe San Francisco State I do n't want to go too far away . It 's good to be near home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na dance ? No , maybe you 're too tired . I 've got great memories of dancing with you . ( We hear the sounds of a song , " Silencio " , by Carlos Gardel . MRS . MEDINA gets up and dances to the music . ) You loved that song . I never understood why . You 've never been to Buenos Aires , but you acted like you had been born there . I mean , because you got so emotional  --  and you got that dark tango face , you know the face I mean ? The one where you look like you 're in love with death . That face always scared me . It hurt my heart to look at you sometimes , so much longing . What was that you always used to tell me ? p. 48 MRS . MEDINA ( Describing a rudimentary tango step and general dance philosophy . ) Side , back , quick , quick , together . Side , back , quick , quick , together . Do n't look at me . Never look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you looked , you would devour her , so to keep within the boundaries of society  --  never look . The dance floor becomes the bedroom when you look . Side , back , quick , quick , together . And repeat . EFRAIN MEDINA That 's right . That 's what you always said . MRS . MEDINA Come dance with me . Come dance with me , baby . EFRAIN MEDINA I 'd rather watch . ( SID enters and dances with MRS . MEDINA . ) MRS . MEDINA That 's a good way to learn . You ca n't really explain what it is that happens when you hold someone you love . You ca n't teach that kind of rhythm . It 's only when your heart begins to beat the same way that you understand the embrace of a dance . ( MR . MEDINA enters and cuts in on SID , who moves off into the shadows . HE tangos with MRS . MEDINA and after HE sings a little , the song ends and another begins but much softer , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) MRS . MEDINA You were always so jealous , Poochie. p. 49 MR . MEDINA ( Overlapping with MRS . MEDINA ; sings along with the song which gets very loud . ) " Silencio en la noche " You still feel good . You still feel real good . My old lady . Everybody asks me about my old lady who do n't look so old . " Who 's the new talent ? " they ask . I do n't care what they say as long as they keep making money for me  --  but when the money stops , they better watch what they say , right , baby ? MRS . MEDINA Right , baby . ( THEY kiss , then move to sit on the couch again , as LORENZO enters . ) LORENZO MEDINA What are you listening to that old shit for ? ( HE abruptly turns off the music . ) EFRAIN MEDINA Ma wanted to hear it . LORENZO MEDINA Oh , really ? Did she ? What hearing she must have ! No ears left  --  EFRAIN MEDINA DO N'T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still she loves to hear her tangos . That 's almost superhuman , I would say . She 's some kind of woman our mother . EFRAIN MEDINA Yes , she is . LORENZO MEDINA ( Picking off a piece of her scalp and holding it up first to the light and then to EFRAIN . ) Some kind of woman indeed .

MARGO LOPEZ Oooey ! Look at this . I think it 's a piece of his head . He 's older than he says he is , if he 's losing his hair like this . LALY LOPEZ That could not be his hair , stupid . He must have a dog or something . MARGO LOPEZ I have n't seen no dog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe he wears a wig . LALY LOPEZ Does it matter ? Does it change how much we worship him ? MARGO LOPEZ I do n't worship him , Laly . You do . LALY LOPEZ Does it matter ? He 's gon na eat the food I cooked for him and he 's gon na start burning inside with love for me . MARGO LOPEZ You been watching too many movies , Laly . It do n't work like that . LALY LOPEZ How 's it work ? MARGO LOPEZ You kiss , you cooch , you marry , you imagine you love somebody else and resent everyone who 's single , and then right before you die , you fall in love with your husband because you do n't wan na die alone . ( The doorbell rings. ) p. 52 LALY LOPEZ What a theory ! Better take it over to the door and open it . I 'll light the candles . MARGO LOPEZ ( Talking to herself ) She better stop treating me like a dog or  --  I 'm going say something one day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! That 's all . ( MARGO goes to the door and LALY takes the gun out of her purse . The subtitle screen reads : " What do you believe ? " ) LALY LOPEZ This could n't have happened at a better time . You feel colder than you look in the movies . Heavier too . But they say the camera puts on ten or twenty , so I should n't be surprised . You and I are gon na get to be good friends . A good friend helps you win your man against all odds  --  tells you when he 's stepping out on you and with who , or lets you know about other kinds of danger danger you could n't see coming all by yourself . Yeah . What could be better ? He would n't let me cook for him , if he did n't see the love in my eyes . He must see the love in my eyes . They burn when I look at him  --  like after a good hard cry . ( Pause ) I had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love me . He 's going to be mine tonight.I know it . It could happen at any time . It will  --  definitely happen . ( LALY gently cradles the gun like RAMON cradled the dildo as the lights fade. ) @x The Dinner Party . MARGO stands at the door about to open it . RAMON stops her . The subtitle screen reads : " WHEN STARS COLLAPSE " RAMON NOVARRO Wait ! I 'm still not dressed . MARGO LOPEZ You look okay . RAMON NOVARRO Do I ? MARGO LOPEZ Sure . ( SHE examines him more closely ) Well , maybe you should brush your teeth . ( RAMON sprays his throat with breath spray . MARGO sniffs his breath and then nods her approval . Then SHE opens the door and in walks MARLENE DIETRICH , dressed in a man 's military uniform . SHE carries a bouquet of flowers and hands them to MARGO . ) MARLENE DIETRICH I was going to give these to Ramon , but you 're much prettier , Muschi . ( German for " kitty cat " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARLENE DIETRICH " M " names are so powerful , do n't you think . Like moans and longings they sound MARGO LOPEZ Yeah . Can I take your hat ? MARLENE DIETRICH No . ( RAMON enters ) p. 54 RAMON NOVARRO Darling ! Darling ! Darling ! MARLENE DIETRICH Yes . Yes . Yes . RAMON NOVARRO Where are the girls ? MARLENE DIETRICH Which girls ? RAMON NOVARRO You know . MARLENE DIETRICH Really , Ramon . I do n't know where you get these people . Why do you keep doing this to yourself ? Do you really think they would fool anybody ? RAMON NOVARRO Ssssh ! ! Tonight is not for scolding . It 's my way of having fun , Marlene . Sometimes you have to pay for your fun . MARLENE DIETRICH Certain kinds of fun is not healthy . The studios will never hire you if you keep this up . MARGO LOPEZ ( To LALY ) I think it 's true . What they say . She 's very mannish . LALY LOPEZ I think she 's beautiful . Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen or something . MARGO LOPEZ It 's something all right . Something I could never be . Maybe that 's what bothers me about her . She 's too free . I do n't wan na be that free . If I was that free something weird might happen to me . I might ask for too many things and I might get them and then I 'd have to do something with them . You know what I mean ? I 'd have people expecting things of me . I do n't want that . p. 55 LALY LOPEZ What are you talking about , Margo ? ( The doorbell rings . ) Oh , here come the rest of them . Get that , will you ? ( MARGO shoots her a look of anger . ) Please ? ( MARGO goes to the door and opens it . SID as RITA HAYWORTH enters . ) MARLENE DIETRICH I ca n't believe you still have this thing around , Ramon . The little witchy-poo . RITA HAYWORTH Have n't you gotten over it ? It 's not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never really said all those mean things about you . Those were just gossip-rag lies . MARLENE DIETRICH They said I had a beard ! RITA HAYWORTH They said you were a beard . Protecting his reputation so he could go out with married women . That 's very different , darling . MARLENE DIETRICH And how dare they say Rita was more interesting to saw in half than I was ? ! And I did that silly magic show of his for charity . It 's outrageous ! RITA HAYWORTH It was just a matter of costuming , Marlene . My dress was more appropriate . MARLENE DIETRICH That 's true . Without the right dress , you 're nothing . That 's something you and Rita do share.Your two talents are milking a bottle of red dye dry and sloppy blow jobs . p. 56 RITA HAYWORTH I 'm many things but I 'm not sloppy . I , unlike other women with children , have been able to maintain a perfect figure . ( MARLENE begins to move in on RITA/SID , but RAMON comes between them trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RITA/SID and kissing her ) You look great , Rita . The whole look is so you , I ca n't begin to express the youness of it. It 's  --  truly you . Come in , sit down . ( To MARLENE ) You promised you 'd play along . MARLENE DIETRICH Only because I worry about you . RAMON NOVARRO ( Shouting to LALY nervously ) BRING US SOME WINE , GIRL . LALY LOPEZ Okay , Okay ! ! Margo go  --  ( MARGO takes her arm and pulls her into the kitchen . ) MARGO LOPEZ Listen ! This is not fun anymore . Ca n't we go home ? LALY LOPEZ And leave Mr. Novarro high and dry , with no sancocho to his name ? No way . MARGO LOPEZ I 'm going . LALY LOPEZ Do n't you dare ! ! What would Papi say ? RAMON NOVARRO ( Shouting from the dining room ) WHERE 'S THAT WINE ? ? p. 57 LALY LOPEZ Exactly . Does n't he remind you of  --  MARGO LOPEZ No , he does n't . RAMON NOVARRO ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The wine . ( Pause ; listening ; there is no sound ) What ? It 's not easy hearing voices all the time . Especially when they do n't speak very clearly . ( Pause ) Sometimes I do n't mind it But all the time It 's more than I can bear . MARLENE DIETRICH It 's more than anyone can bear RITA HAYWORTH I agree with you there . Did you call the Press ? I saw a strange car out front . All dirty and mean like the press . Hopper 's looking for a reason to crucify me again . RAMON NOVARRO The press . No , I hope ( Pause ; listening ) Hear that ? Maybe if I had a bigger place , or a newer place , I would n't hear them so well  --  but I do n't mean to complain sometimes when the voices go away , I hear a pounding in my head . Ba-bam , ba-bam , ba-bam  --  like a heartbeat , but with more percussion and maybe a dull triangle tinging off to one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the skin of my palm and it feels like the inside of my eye . p. 58 RITA HAYWORTH ( Taking RAMON 's hand gently ) It 's alright , Ramon . I feel that sometimes too that kind of pain . But pain can be good sometimes , when it 's controlled . You know what I mean ? It 's not real pain we 're talking about anyway  --  not like a finger pricked on a needle . MARLENE DIETRICH The hardest pain is the pain of not knowing . ( Offering RAMON and RITA/SID a cigarette ) Want one ? You ? ( THEY all light up and inhale . ) MARLENE , RITA/SID &amp; RAMON Aaaahh RITA HAYWORTH It 's all relative , really . My father used to burn holes into my waist with his cigarettes so I would remember to lose weight there . MARLENE DIETRICH Sounds effective . RITA HAYWORTH Yes it was . The electrolysis hurt more though . I miss my widow 's peak sometimes ( Lights cross to LALY &amp; MARGO in the kitchen , looking into steaming pots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned it ? ! Where were you ? You shoulda been watching out for the food . It was your idea . LALY LOPEZ You 're the cook . Everybody says so . Let Margo do it . It tastes better when she does it.Ha ! This is gon na taste like  --  p. 59 MARGO LOPEZ Do n't ! Say another word and I go out that back door . ( Long pause ; LALY begins to cry . ) Do n't start doing that . It won'work on me no more ! You 're pulling the rugs over my heart when you do that ! Stop crying ! Look I 'm starting a new sancocho . But you better keep them out of the kitchen . LALY LOPEZ Okey-dokey . ( LALY runs out and makes an announcement . ) AIR-RAID ! ! Run for your lives ! ! ( THEY all run out . LALY comes back to MARGO . ) How was that ? MARGO LOPEZ What happens when they find out it was a false alarm , Laly ? Do n't you care what you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people dying . That 's not a nice thing to joke about . LALY LOPEZ People die all the time  --  like us , the other day in that audition . I think we chose the wrong music . MARGO LOPEZ You do n't care about nothing , do you ? I used to think you were my baby . Because I saw you get born and I thought seeing you all small and red and slimy like that that we was gon na be forever together . I thought I was always gon na have to hold onto the back of your neck to keep your head up so you could see all around and be ready for anything , but I do n't like the things you 're seeing now . p. 60 LALY LOPEZ Shut up and cook ! MARGO LOPEZ ( Taking off her apron in a huff ) That 's it . LALY LOPEZ Do n't leave me here alone , Margo . MARGO LOPEZ You do n't need nobody . LALY LOPEZ I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! Please help me out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silently , MARGO puts the apron back on and continues to cook . ) I knew I could count on you . I 'm gon na go upstairs and snoop around . I bet movie stars got interesting things in their bedrooms . At least one interesting thing anyway ( LALY begins to exit but then turns back to MARGO ) I was just doing the first thing I could think of to get them out . What would you have done ? MARGO LOPEZ Not that . ( LALY exits . MARGO is alone , cooking in silence . ) MARGO LOPEZ Something wierd is going on . ( Lights cross fade slowly to SID/RITA , sitting in the threshold of the house smoking a cigar . ) SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL ( In his SID voice , with the wig off . ) Coo . I tried to tell them . In an air raid you go to the basement not outside . But nobody ever listens to me . I do n't even listen to me . What did I just say ? I do n't even know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You 're the only thing can calm me down anymore , boy . The best six inches I 'll see tonight . ( With a laugh ) He 's not that bad , for an older man . The only thing is he does remind me of my father . And that can get in the way . It was exciting the first time , but it makes me nervous now . Everything makes me nervous . This costume makes me nervous . I 'm not a redhead in my soul . If he would just let me play a blonde , I 'd feel so much better . Blondes are always in the party mood . ( Pause ; HE puts out his cigar on the wall beside him , then HE looks up into the clear sky and speaks in his RITA voice ) Those girls lied . Too bad . I was looking forward to it . ( SID puts his wig back on , puts out the cigar , checks his make-up and walks to the bedroom . HE sees LALY there playing with RAMON 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Oscar , a microphone , her own phallus , a Q-Tip , all while looking into a full-length mirror . Her miming is subtitled like SHE is in a silent film and also through composed , with the sound of applause , music , crowds , etc . The subtitles read as follows:Oscar miming  --  Thank you ! Thank you ! It is so important to have the admiration of your peers . I love you all ! Microphone  --  I just wanted to say , I 'm so proud to be here before all you fine servicemen  --  Do n't worry I 'll show you my legs later ! I want to say thank you and promise each of you a dance after the show ! And to the rest of you working back home  --  buy more war bonds ! A Q-Tip  --  Gets all the brown out . See ? Phallus  --  Can you take it ? Can you take it all in your mouth ? Young and tight . I love you . Do n't tell anyone . Do n't tell your mother . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves out of sight. ) p. 61 LALY LOPEZ ( Shrugs ; SHE smells the dildo ) He does n't use this too often I guess , even though he loves itSmells kinda salty , but more like tears . ( SHEputs down the dildo and begins to go through the purses lined neatly against a wall . SHE pulls out a burned letter , a letter " R " . ) Maybe he keeps it so he wo n't forget his name . " R " for Ramon or maybe it 's Rita . He must really love her . ( Lights cross to LORENZO and EFRAIN in the bathtub . LORENZO sits behind EFRAIN and scrubs his back with a sponge . EFRAIN sits with his head down . LORENZO puts down the sponge and picks up a tennis racket . HE breaks the racket , separating the oval , netted part from the long wooden part . EFRAIN reacts to the sound of the breaking like he 's being hit . Then LORENZO begins to rub EFRAIN 's back with the oval part . ) LORENZO MEDINA Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Cool ! ( HE laughs . EFRAIN does not respond . ) Hey , I love my new hairpiece . They say you can even swim with it . Touch it . Even though it 's wet , it wo n't come off . Go ahead , touch it . ( LORENZO puts EFRAIN 's hand on his head . ) See ? ( Lights cross to MARGO in the kitchen , cooking . ) MARGO LOPEZ I know when it started . That summer when Mami sent me to Puerto Rico to stay with Titi Cmbu and my foot got caught in a screen door and got tore off and I had to get stitches but they got infected and I had to stay a year there and then Mami came to P.R . to be with me . And Laly was home with Papi . Something wierd . She almost drowned that summer . Why 'd she go in the water in the first place ? She was so scared of water she could n't hardly take showers when she was little . I always had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said she thought the water would enter through her eyes and kill her . Water does n't do that  --  not in the shower anyway . ( Pause ) What was she doing at the beach ? ( SID enters quietly watching MARGO cook for a moment  --  then HE speaks ) p. 62 RITA HAYWORTH I like the way you cook . MARGO LOPEZ Thank you very much . It 's almost ready . RITA HAYWORTH You 're quiet and dignified when you cook . I used to be like that . MARGO LOPEZ You just had a baby girl , did n't you ? I read about it . RITA HAYWORTH It 's hard to have secrets for someone like me . ( Pause ) She 's very beautiful . I think she looks like him , but everybody says she looks just like me . I was glad that she was healthy . Children need to be protected , you know , from things . You 're not happy being a cook , are you ? MARGO LOPEZ I do n't mind cooking . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAYWORTH Where are you from ? MARGO LOPEZ New York . RITA HAYWORTH New York 's a great town . I spent last fall there . Even wrote a song about it . MARGO LOPEZ Really ? RITA HAYWORTH Yes . It goes something like this ( Singing ) There 's a bite in the air , and it 's filled with despair , ' cause it 's Autumn in New York and you 're not here.Here beside me , watching leaves turn into flame.Here to kiss me when my heart fills up with shame.It 's oh so hard knowing that you are so far  --  but , Daddy , I know we 'll meet again upon a star . p. 63 MARGO LOPEZ That 's beautiful . You must really love him , your father . RITA HAYWORTH Yes . MARGO LOPEZ Your voice is different from when I seen you in the movies . RITA HAYWORTH Yes . They do n't like those deep Spanish voices very much . I 'll go find the others . Those two can get up to all kinds of mischief together . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hear the sound from the movie " Mexican Spitfire 's Elephant " as lights cross to LORENZO &amp; EFRAIN in the bathroom , dressing for a costume party . EFRAIN is having his eyes done by LORENZO . LORENZO dresses like LUPE VELEZ and EFRAIN dresses like DOLORES DEL RIO . When the sound stops THEY speak . ) EFRAIN MEDINA Are you sure everybody 's going to be dressed like this ? LORENZO MEDINA Of course . It 's the latest thing . Men only , dressed like famous women . It 's an offshoot of that male liberation thing Some people like to beat drums  --  Others dress up . Same difference . EFRAIN MEDINA I feel stupid but it is kind of fun . LORENZO MEDINA There you go . It is going to be a lot of fun . Nothing to be scared of . p. 64 EFRAIN MEDINA What 's the most scared you 've ever been ? LORENZO MEDINA I had to kick a girl 's ass once . That was pretty terrifying . EFRAIN MEDINA Was she big ? LORENZO MEDINA No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never talk to me . I tried so many times to get her to talk and she just looked at me with cold eyes . Everybody else saw this sweetness except for me . I could n't get near it . I could n't touch it . I could n't touch her . So I had to kick her ass and I knew everybody else would hate me for it . But what could I do ? Let her get away with it ? With humiliating me ? No way . I had to do it and I had to pay the consequences . ( Finishing putting on his make-up ) Are my lip lines straight ? EFRAIN MEDINA Yes . My seams ? LORENZO MEDINA Perfect . EFRAIN MEDINA So why was that scary ? LORENZO MEDINA Because I did n't know what would happen to me if I did it , but it was worth it because I loved the way my foot felt on her ass . I just wish I could have put it up inside her . That would have been really worthwhile . EFRAIN MEDINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really mean ? p. 65 LORENZO MEDINA If I only said things I mean , I 'd have nothing to say . EFRAIN MEDINA That 's what I thought . LORENZO MEDINA I 'm going to miss them now they 're gone . EFRAIN MEDINA Stop it . LORENZO MEDINA Do n't you think I mean that ? I 'm more compassionate than you think , Fifi . In fact , I am the most compassionate person I know . I did n't make her suffer like you would have . EFRAIN MEDINA Do n't . LORENZO MEDINA ( Mimicking EFRAIN ) You do it ! You finish her off ! I ca n't stand that screaming ! Make the screaming stop , Lorenzo ! Make it stop ! But it did n't work , did it , Efrain ? You still hear it , do n't you ? You make me sick . I 'll wait for you outside . ( LORENZO exits and lights cross with him to the threshold of the front door . HE sits and begins to notice bugs all around him . Lights cross to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowls . LALY enters . ) MARGO LOPEZ So what did you find ? Any money ? LALY LOPEZ He loves her . Her things are all over his room . MARGO LOPEZ Who are you talking about ? p. 66 LALY LOPEZ Ramon . He loves Rita . They must be having an affair . MARGO LOPEZ No . I just talked to her . She 's got a little baby at home with that big guy . She does n't need anybody else . She 's very happy . She told me so . LALY LOPEZ You are so naive , Margo . People have affairs all the time here . It 's cultural . MARGO LOPEZ Paintings are cultural  --  not little chinga-plingas with people you ai n't married to . LALY LOPEZ Sometimes you just marry the wrong person . And then you meet the person you were meant to be with and it 's too late . So you make do with the occasional night in an everchanging town where no one knows your name . And only the soiled sheets remain to prove you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are definitely going back to New York , Laly . This place is making you coo-coo . Everything you say now sounds like a bad movie . That 's no way to live . LALY LOPEZ You 're going back  --  not me . MARGO LOPEZ We 'll see . LALY LOPEZ And when did you start getting so friendly with Rita ? I thought you hated movie stars . MARGO LOPEZ I don ' hate them . I just don ' got time for them . There 's too many other things to think about.And anyway , she 's different . She 's one of the nice ones . She came and talked to me , I did n't go acting like a dog , like you do , saying " please talk to me . I 'll lick your face if you do ! " That man is not gon na fall in love with you , Laly. p. 67 LALY LOPEZ I 'll bring in the food . ( LALY begins to exit carrying some of the serving bowls MARGO has filled . ) MARGO LOPEZ That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't count for nothing here . You hear me ? ! LALY LOPEZ No . ( Lights cross back to LORENZO still seated in the doorway . HE has been killing bugs . HE kills them with his thumb against the wall beside him which has long red streaks on it now . Then HE begins to count how many HE 's killed , after capturing and killing one more . ) LORENZO MEDINA Got you ! So how many is that ? One , two , three , four , five , six , oops , you guys are beginning to run together , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven and lucky number twelve . I wonder if any of you guys knew each other before this ? Before you were snubbed out on my wall . My wall . Nice sound to that . She taught me how to count . And he taught me what counts . ( Laughs ) I think my true calling would have been comedy . It 's all in the timing . ( Pause ) What 's taking so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in to EFRAIN . ) EFRAIN MEDINA Did you hear that ? LORENZO MEDINA The screaming ? p. 68 EFRAIN MEDINA Yes I thought you finished  --  LORENZO MEDINA I do n't hear a thing . Get in the car and put on the radio , loud . ( We hear some more of " Mexican Spitfire 's Elephant " , the part where Lupe sings " No me importa tu Mama " as lights cross to the dinner party , where the same Velez song is playing softly in the back ground as mood music . RAMON &amp; RITA/SID dance . LALY watches . LALY speaks but no one can hear her . ) LALY LOPEZ I love this song . It 's so free . I do n't care about my family , it says , as long you 'll be mine . MARLENE DIETRICH Is that Lupe singing ? ( They ignore her . Louder . ) I said is that Lupe ? ? ( THEY continue to ignore her . Miffed , SHE turns off the radio . THEY stop dancing . ) I hate Nazis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARLENE DIETRICH NO ! Of course not . RITA HAYWORTH Oh My mistake . MARLENE DIETRICH Yes . Just because I am German , does not mean that I 'm a Nazi . Nazis can be anywhere Even here . RITA HAYWORTH Those two girls ? ! p. 69 MARLENE DIETRICH Could be Nazis nothing says they are n't and they did send us out on a false alarm . Hmmm we must all be careful now . How long have you known them , Ramon ? RAMON NOVARRO Uhmm , let 's see About two hours , I 'd say . MARLENE DIETRICH Two hours ? ! Two hours and you let them in your house ? You let them cook for you ? Why ? RAMON NOVARRO I 'm a trusting person and I needed the help . And they spoke Spanish  --  I like that in a woman reminds me of my mother . I get homesick sometimes . RITA HAYWORTH Mexico 's not that far away . RAMON NOVARRO But Mama 's gone . It would n't be the same without her . ( Lights cross to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEDINA It 's a dream . EFRAIN MEDINA How can I be dreaming awake ? That 's not normal . LORENZO MEDINA It 's a flashback  --  like in Citizen Kane . Remember ? EFRAIN MEDINA But that whole movie was a flashback . LORENZO MEDINA So ? EFRAIN MEDINA Dreams are better than flashbacks . Like in Carrie . When that hand comes up  --  creepy . But it turns out to be a dream and that 's better , than if it really happened . p. 70 LORENZO MEDINA I like movies where they have those shots that dissolve into spinning spirals  --  like in Spellbound real psychedelic . That 's the only reason I thought about buying a Volkswagon Beetle  --  so I could get those crazy wheel covers . I bet people faint from looking at those for too long . EFRAIN MEDINA Yes . I bet you 're right . ( Pause ) I could almost faint right now  --  just from hearing about it . ( The sound of MRS . MEDINA screaming . EFRAIN faints .

We hear the sound from the movie " THEY MET IN ARGENTINA " as the lights cross to Scene 2. ) p. 71 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWO : SCENE 2 We see or hear a scene from the movie " THEY MET IN ARGENTINA " starring America 's sweetheart , Maureen O'Hara as a native and Buddy Ebsen as her co-star . Followed by a NewsReel short about protests in Argentina against the movie . In it , we see SID , setting a movie theater on fire . We watch him watch it burn as the voiceover begins . Then we see him being interviewed live . NEWSREEL REPORTER ( Miked sound from offstage ) This from our offices in once sunny Argentina : Angry mobs burned all movie theatres showing only American movies , to protest the opening of " THEY MET IN ARGENTINA "  --  a gay romp in the Pampas starring America 's darling , Maureen O'Hara as the devilish Native paramour of our delightful Buddy Ebsen . No more movies will be filmed here until these mad protests stop . Studio chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maureen is dazzling . We do n't get it ! Natives say : O'Hara go home ! Darryl Zanuck put forty thousand extra dollars into DOWN ARGENTINE WAY to re-shoot the scenes of local customs to pacify the mobs . " Zanuck says , " after the Zoot Suits riots of last year , we want to be accurate . " Many sailors and others were injured in that shameful incident . Let 's hope it does n't happen again , because if this keeps up , I 'm afraid the studios will be saying , " Good-bye , Argentina ! " On the homefront there were protests too . Lupe " Spitfire " Velez says : " Chee Don ' Ebben Espeak Espanish ! That crazy Lupe ! But let 's speak to a native Argentinian : What 's all this about ? p. 72 SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL I  --  NEWSREEL REPORTER ( offstage ) Oh . Sorry . English ? You habla ?

SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL I fell in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( SID continues to speak even though the reporter turns away from him . ) NEWSREEL REPORTER ( offstage ) Oh . Cut . This guy 's not very interesting . Let 's find a burn victim . SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL ( Continuing )  --  My mother took me to see a film starring Carlos Gardel . What a beautiful man ! Before I saw that movie I did n't think I 'd find anyone to love . I was already seven and still no crushes or fast heartbeats . Mami loved him too . I wanted Mami to find him and marry him  --  so at least he 'd be in the family and then , when I was old enough  --  and she died  --  I could marry him too . Those songs he wrote and sang were like the songs of angels ( We hear Gardel 's " Sus Ojos Se Cerraron " . As SID continues to speak , WE see EFRAIN cradling his mother 's lifeless body , and LALY washing her hands in the kitchen sink with her eyes tightly closed. ) p. 73 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She died in my arms . " What could be more romantic ? ( SID closes his eyes . ) The most important thing is the flame . I like the blue in the orange . The blue is the true heat  --  the heat from my fingertips . A hot lick of flame is better than sex . Better than anything . A sweet burn . And the smell , oh , it 's like dying roses or the trunk of a dead tree . ( Pause ; opening his eyes ; the subtitle screen comes on and his words are translated from Spanish as HE continues to speak . ) Despus que Pap mat a ese hombre , quizo conecer a Dios . Fu al bosque en mi pueblo para encontralo  --  en los rboles . El vi la cara de Pap Dios en un rbol muerto . Cada da hasta el da que muro , el lo vi . Cada da lentamente se me fue desapareciendo . Despus que encontro a Dios , no me habl , ni me mir  --  su hijo nico . Ese fue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ese bosque que yo dej caer de mis pequeas manos  --  manos de un nio desolado  --  y el bosque desapareci tambien.After Pap killed that man , he wanted to meet God . He went to the forest in my town to find him  --  in the trees . And he saw the face of God the father in a dead tree . Each day until the day he died , God appeared to him . And each day slowly he disappeared from me . After he found God , he did n't speak to me , or even look at me  --  his only son . That was my first fire . A candle in the night in that forest which I dropped from my small hands  --  the hands of a grieving son  --  and the forest disappeared too . ( Pause ) No saba que el estaba en el bosque esa noche . Pero todo el mundo se muere verdad ? De algo ? I did n't know he was in the forest that night . But everyone dies , right ? Of something ?

LALY &amp; MARGO have changed into their tap dancing outfits , the red ones they wore at the beginning of the play . LORENZO &amp; EFRAIN are completely transformed into LUPE VELEZ &amp; DOLORES . DEL RIO . THEY are lipsynching  --  to the Lupe Velez song , " No Me Importas Tu Mam . " THEY do a wild , sambaesque , jazzy interpretive dance during the instrumental part . At the end of the song , MARGO trips and falls and so does EFRAIN . MARGO/EFRAIN I ca n't believe the things I do for you . ( LALY &amp; LORENZO smile . ) LALY/LORENZO Me neither .

MARLENE DIETRICH You would think that would n't you They must have sewed your ass closed when they did your nose . You cunt !

( RITA &amp; MARLENE both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lights cross to LALY and MARGO in the kitchen trying to figure out which of the many different wine glasses to use . ) MARGO LOPEZ How about these ? LALY LOPEZ Those are for red wine . We 're serving white . MARGO LOPEZ What 's the difference ? LALY LOPEZ White wine glasses are small and delicate . Red wine glasses are larger and fuller . MARGO LOPEZ Why ? LALY LOPEZ Because  --  do n't you know anything ? MARGO LOPEZ No . Why ? LALY LOPEZ ( Fishing for an answer ) Because . Because white wine is  --  delicate and red wine is  --  MARGO LOPEZ Fuller ? p. 78 LALY LOPEZ Yes . Now get those small ones down from that cabinet .

MARGO LOPEZ And what if it 's me he wants ? It was me he told to go to the bedroom , remember ? LALY LOPEZ Go near him and I 'll kill you . MARGO LOPEZ Really ? How ?

( LALY nudges MARGO as if to say " I told you so . " ) Like phone calls from your agent that never come . RITA HAYWORTH Agents are like bad parents  --  you hate them most of the time , but once they tell you you 're wonderful , you ca n't do without them . I would n't be who I am today without my agent . He made me . MARLENE DIETRICH Your mama made you . RITA HAYWORTH You know what I mean . MARLENE DIETRICH Unfortunately , yes . RITA HAYWORTH You 've changed your clothes , girls . Very cute . MARLENE DIETRICH Ravishing . LALY LOPEZ Thanks . I  --  my sister and I have a new dance routine we 'd like to show you later . RAMON NOVARRO I told you earlier , girls . No entertainment . We get enough of that out there . p. 81 MARLENE DIETRICH Let them dance , Ramon . What harm could it do ? RITA HAYWORTH Yes . I 'd like a little show . It 's nice to watch other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelly is a madman . He never stops . I 'm still exhausted from it . RAMON NOVARRO I do n't think people who cook should dance . It 's too different , one from the other . I like the people I see dancing not to cook . That way I know who I can ask for a dance . I would never dance with a cook . ( The doorbell rings . ) Finally ! Get back to work . ( MARGO moves to answer it . Lights cross to LUPE/LORENZO and DOLORES/EFRAIN in the threshold . ) EFRAIN MEDINA I 'm writing a screenplay . LORENZO MEDINA Good . Maybe there 'll be a producer at this party . A good screenplay is always marketable . ( LORENZO goes to ring the doorbell , EFRAIN stops him . ) EFRAIN MEDINA Wait . LORENZO MEDINA Why ? EFRAIN MEDINA It 's about to start . LORENZO MEDINA It started years ago . EFRAIN MEDINA The lies I mean . p. 82 LORENZO MEDINA I know what you mean . EFRAIN MEDINA They 're lying there in  --  LORENZO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new carpets .

You 're Dolores Del Rio , screen siren , seen about town with Orson Welles and others And beautiful . What movies were you in ? EFRAIN MEDINA I do n't remember . LORENZO MEDINA Remember . We went over it . Half the fun is being convincing . You want to be an actor , do n't you ? This is just the biggest role you ever got . EFRAIN MEDINA I did almost get that guest spot on " The Next Generation . " LORENZO MEDINA Sure you did . You gave a great audition . I helped you , remember ? We got the sides and I played the Bajoran beauty Calyx and you were Lt. Sanchez . EFRAIN MEDINA That was a great script ( Acting his audition as SANCHEZ ) I 'm afraid I can not go back with you . LORENZO MEDINA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our planets are in synch now . We could be happy . p. 83 EFRAIN MEDINA Calyx , I 'm afraid I 'm afraid I 'm  --  dying . LORENZO MEDINA No ! EFRAIN MEDINA Yes . I have a polyp on my brain that 's slowly driving me mad . I must go where I can harm no one . The first phase is violent . I would n't  --  I could n't hurt you . I would rather die ! ( EFRAIN puts an imaginary phaser to his head . LORENZO pulls it away . ) LORENZO MEDINA You must n't . I ca n't go on alone ! EFRAIN MEDINA I must return to my pod and  --  fly into the ionic storm field . LORENZO MEDINA I wo n't go on without you ! EFRAIN MEDINA Yes  --  you must . You must go on for both of us . One last kiss sweet Calyx . ( THEY kiss . ) LORENZO MEDINA ( Dropping the act ) Let 's do that part again . ( LORENZO kisses EFRAIN passionately . EFRAIN pushes him away . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the floor when you 're sitting in the dark and something scary happens ? " ) EFRAIN MEDINA I was good , huh ? I wonder why I did n't get the part . LORENZO MEDINA You should have gotten Dad to give them a call . He always manages to get things done . p. 84 EFRAIN MEDINA I wanted to do it myself , by myself . LORENZO MEDINA By any means necessary . Nothing is too much to ask of others or too little to ask of yourself . EFRAIN MEDINA I hate that book . He read it to us at least once a week . The Salesman 's Bible . I never wanted to be a salesman I wanted to be a model  --  or an actor . Whatever something creative . LORENZO MEDINA You can be anything you want to be now . EFRAIN MEDINA That 's right . I could make myself up , re-create in any form , like that guy on the Next Generation . I 'm a morph . ( Laughing ) That 's why I did n't get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it that it 's always people with names like Sanchez that die in the future ? LORENZO MEDINA Like that chick with the muscles in Aliens 2 . Man , was she hot  --  EFRAIN MEDINA  --  but iced in the end . LORENZO MEDINA Dark people never survive . Like on The Equalizer . I hated that show . Too many Spanish women chasing ambulances , screaming " Ay Dios mio ! Mi hijo pobrecito ! Esomebody ekilled heem ! " EFRAIN MEDINA Since when do you care about Spanish women ? p. 85 LORENZO MEDINA Since I put on this dress . Makes me feel different . Makes me feel very  --  Lupe , jou no wat I meang ? EFRAIN MEDINA ( With a smile ) I think I 'm ready now . ( In his DOLORES spanish accented and dignified voice ) Where 's that little manstealer ? ! I 'll bite off her hair at the roots . People think I 'm quiet and dignified , but I do n't let people get away with things . LUPE VELEZ Jes , darleeng . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . ( Lights cross to the dinner party .

DOLORES DEL RIO Yes , well , I ca n't argue with that . It 's all very old to me now . Congratulations . RITA HAYWORTH Thank you . RAMON NOVARRO Already ? He left her already . She has such a hard time keeping them around , does n't she ? RITA HAYWORTH That stupid Frenchman . Does n't he have any morals at all ? The French are so peculiar that way . p. 87 LUPE VELEZ You theenk I ca n't hear jous talking in front of my back ? ! I 'm having his baby , that bastard ! And he just says go kill it  --  and if he ai n't gon na have no father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babies need they fathers MARLENE DIETRICH Stop talking nonsense . Have some wine .

LALY LOPEZ ( Looking at MARGO expectantly . ) Would you mind ? MARGO LOPEZ Of course not  --  I 'm the shy type . ( Under her breath ) Cabrona . ( MARGO exits . MARLENE follows her . The lights cross to the kitchen . ) MARGO LOPEZ ( Uncorking several wine bottles ) She 's gon na push me too far one day . One day I 'll just leave her here . Then she 'll miss me and then she 'll unnerstan what a sister is . Loyal , fair , honest and just as pretty , just as talented , just as smart as jou . But she don ' unnerstan that . She thinks I 'm estupid because I have an accent . But I jus ' don ' wan na get rid of it like she do . She thinks fake is better than real . I 'm the real theeng baby . And don ' you forget it ! ( MARLENE has entered somewhere in the middle of MARGO 's tirade , unnoticed by MARGO . MARLENE lights a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the hardest to follow " ) MARLENE DIETRICH I would n't forget anything you said , querida . You 're very passionate about your sister .

She 's not dead , is she ? And she talks so much and so loud . It hurts my brain . DOLORES DEL RIO She 's a dear really , but so coarse . Always screaming " I 'm a Mexican , I 'm a Mexican ! " So what ? It 's better to call yourself Spanish , then you can be anything . p. 90 RITA HAYWORTH I call myself Rita  --  but I am Spanish , I mean , really , my father was from Spain . People here assume you 're from Mexico . I ca n't stand that . DOLORES DEL RIO What 's wrong with Mexico ? RAMON NOVARRO Yes , darling . What 's wrong with it ? RITA HAYWORTH Nothing . Anyway , you two always play other things , Indians , Polynesians and Frenchmen , you know what I 'm saying . RAMON NOVARRO Exactly . DOLORES DEL RIO Precisely . LALY LOPEZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm Puerto Rican . RAMON NOVARRO Good nightclubs there . LALY LOPEZ You 're thinking of Cuba . DOLORES DEL RIO They 're right next to each other are n't they ? LALY LOPEZ Sort of , I guess . Yes . Great nightclubs . I sing and  --  RAMON NOVARRO Yes , dear , you mentioned it . Can you see what happened to Marlene ? Your sister might need  --  DOLORES DEL RIO Oh leave them alone . A girl has to have her fun .

MARLENE DIETRICH I know you are trying to bore me , but I find even just listening to your voice enough to keep me awake for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glisten every now and then with the sparkle of your saliva as your tongue moves across them to keep them moist for the next schooldays tale . You 're really something . MARGO LOPEZ I know . Laly calls me a pip . She read it in some novel . She 's always reading novels . MARLENE DIETRICH You 're not a Nazi are you ? MARGO LOPEZ No , I 'm Puerto Rican . MARLENE DIETRICH I know . You told me that part . You were born in Rio Piedras , in a small brown house and you had a dog named Fifi , before he got run over by an Army jeep and then you hated all Americans  --  until you moved to New York and grew to love it . p. 92 MARGO LOPEZ Why do you think I might be a Nazi ? MARLENE DIETRICH It 's a joke . MARGO LOPEZ Oh . Ha , ha . I think we should go back in now . That wine is getting warm . MARLENE DIETRICH Must n't have that . ( MARGO turns away from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm and begins to sing " Honeysuckle Rose " to her . ) " Every honeybee  --  MARGO LOPEZ No , please , seora , jus '  --  MARLENE DIETRICH ( Continuing to sing )  --  fills with jealousy , when they see you out with me You 're confection .

LALY LOPEZ Is n't this fun ? ! ( LALY &amp; MARGO exit to the kitchen . ) RITA HAYWORTH ( To MARLENE ) So what were you two talking so much about ? MARLENE DIETRICH You would n't understand . That 's the pity of you , Rita . RITA HAYWORTH I do n't need your pity , Marlene . MARLENE DIETRICH No one needs pity . p. 94 RITA HAYWORTH I need food . My agent does n't let me eat . If I could have anything in the world , I 'd have the ability to eat without gaining weight . MARLENE DIETRICH That would be marvelous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I eat , eat , eat like a leetle pig .

RAMON NOVARRO Let 's eat . ( THEY eat in silence for a while . LALY &amp; MARGO stand watching them hungrily . ) RAMON NOVARRO You can go off now . Scoot ! RITA HAYWORTH Let them eat , the poor things . MARLENE DIETRICH Are n't you hungry ? MARGO LOPEZ Oh , yes  --  ( LALY jabs her in the side . ) Well , I am. p. 96 LALY LOPEZ It 's pleasure enough just to watch you eat . LUPE VELEZ ( Recovered from her fit of pique ) Yeah , sure . Sit with us . Eat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAMON NOVARRO But they 're servants . I do n't want them to get spoiled  --  like spoiled children , they 'll turn on me , steal my money  --  MARLENE DIETRICH What money ? RAMON NOVARRO I used to have money . MARLENE DIETRICH Yes .

LORENZO &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think there 'll be cameras ? LORENZO MEDINA Does n't matter . EFRAIN MEDINA Then why do we have to change ? LORENZO MEDINA We would never show up in front of Mom and Dad in dresses . They 'd kill us . It 's probable we 'd change before entering the premises . I mean , that 's what they 'll say . EFRAIN MEDINA It 'd be funny if they came when we were still in the dresses though , would n't it ? LORENZO MEDINA Yeah . A laugh riot . Hurry up . EFRAIN MEDINA Why ? LORENZO MEDINA I just want to get it over with . EFRAIN MEDINA I do n't . ( Lights cross back to the dinner party . ) RAMON NOVARRO I do . MARLENE DIETRICH Me too .

MARLENE DIETRICH You just want attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way as bad a shape as Lupe . Or even as bad as me . RAMON NOVARRO And what 's wrong with you now ? MARLENE DIETRICH I 'm in love with your Nazi cook . I ca n't bear it . To be a Nazi is one thing . But to love a Nazi . Well , that 's just crazy . ( Pulls out a gun . RITA &amp; RAMON gasp . ) I found it  --  in her purse ! ( RITA &amp; RAMON gasp again . LALY &amp; MARGO enter carrying a tray with an ugly-looking cake on it . ) LALY &amp; MARGO ( Singing ) " If I knew you were coming , I'da baked a cake . Baked a cake , baked a cake ! If I knew you were coming I'da baked a cake . Howjoudo ! Howjoudo ! Howjoudo ! Doing fine ! Doing fine ! Doing fine ! " MARLENE DIETRICH ( Pointing the gun at them ) Up against the wall .

( Pause ; to MARGO ) But why do you carry a gun ? MARGO LOPEZ That is not my gun . LALY LOPEZ It 's mine . MARGO LOPEZ What are you doing with a gun ? LALY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street in front of the studio this morning . So I put it in my purse because I wanted to see how it might feel to have one .

MARLENE DIETRICH This is very sad . A young girl like you needing a gun . I mean even a fake gun . That 's terribly sad I 'm sorry if I scared you . Why do n't you throw it away now ? LALY LOPEZ No . I do n't want to . It 's the first thing I found in this stinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's magic in it . That director will call me tomorrow , or else I 'll blow his head off .

RITA HAYWORTH Prove you 'd do anything . ( HE takes another , smaller gun out of his pocket and holds it out to her . ) Use mine . It 's more appropriate for a lady . LALY LOPEZ What do you mean ? RITA HAYWORTH Point it at somebody and shoot . Can you do that ? ( HE pulls off his wig . In his SID voice . ) I always wanted to do that . Guns are so direct . MARGO LOPEZ Oh , my gooseness ! I knew there was something funny happening here . Laly , you see ? I was right . p. 103 LALY LOPEZ ( To SID ) You were at my house this morning , were n't you ? I do n't know why I did n't notice before . SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL People only see what they want to see . You have to be ready for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next alarm to go off in your heart . You have to learn to listen . MARGO LOPEZ Do n't listen to these wierd people , Laly . There 's nothing real about them . Like this cold mansion in a desert  --  that 's not right . People should n't live like this . LALY LOPEZ I know , Margo . I know who I am now . Someone Ramon ca n't ever love But what I do n't know is if this gun is real or not . I 'd like to think that it is . This is the part I see in my dreams . ( SHE takes the gun from SID 's hand . ) SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL That 's it , honey . Do n't be afraid . MARLENE DIETRICH ( To SID ) What kind of monster are you ? ! LALY LOPEZ I 'm not afraid to die not for you Ramon . In my dreams , you always stop me .

MARGO LOPEZ There 's a lot I don ' understand , Laly ! I 'm so sorry . Please put that thing down . You do n't got ta prove nothing to nobody . ( LALY begins to puts the gun to her mouth . ) MARLENE DIETRICH I ca n't believe this ! MARGO LOPEZ Do n't ! LALY LOPEZ ( SHE licks the gun . ) Tastes like the ocean . ( MARGO jumps on her sister . Blackout . The sounds of a struggle segues into the sound of one gunshot , which segues into the sound of a telephone ringing . ) ( Lights cross to EFRAIN &amp; LORENZO . EFRAIN is talking on his cellular phone . ) EFRAIN MEDINA Really ? ! I got the part ! I ca n't believe it . Oh , well , it 's all because of you . You really hustled for me and  --  yes ? Oh , yes .

LORENZO MEDINA It started years ago . EFRAIN MEDINA The lies I mean . LORENZO MEDINA I know what you mean . EFRAIN MEDINA They 're lying there in  --  LORENZO MEDINA The carpets will be ruined but we 'll get new carpets . Do n't worry . ( The subtitle screen reads : " so much blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RAMON &amp; MARLENE are screaming . SID holds the gun . LALY &amp; MARGO lie motionless . EFRAIN &amp; LORENZO enter . All THEY see is the blood . THEY stand there viewing it in stunned silence for a moment. ) p. 106 EFRAIN MEDINA It 's everywhere . Like a flood . Like the pipes burst . LORENZO MEDINA You dial SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL ( Holding the gun ) I thought she would kill me . Funny how things surprise you . ( Looking at RAMON ) Really . I did n't mean for it to happen like this . MARLENE DIETRICH ( Lighting a cigarette , while frantically putting on her coat ) No one ever means it when it 's too late to change it . You must be more careful about who you hire , Ramon . RAMON NOVARRO What are we going to do ? SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL Two in one what are the chances of that ? And at a party where we all speak Spanish . Is n't that wierd ? RAMON NOVARRO What do you mean wierd ? SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL Strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I speak it . But I 'm no native  --  like the rest of you . RAMON NOVARRO Two souls . ( Pause ) Maybe it 's a joke . They could n't be dead . Not in my house . MARLENE DIETRICH ( Touching their faces . ) Wake up little birds . Little birds Jesus ! They 're dead alright . I have a daughter to go home to . I 'm sorry , Ramon . ( MARLENE exits . SID , who is still holding the gun , turns and looks at RAMON , who backs away from him slowly. ) p. 107 SIDNEY MARIA PINCEL And you thought I was just a chauffeur . That 's the problem with certain roles . You can only play them for so long and then you begin to forget your lines . LORENZO MEDINA Did you hear me ? Efrain ? Did you hear me ? EFRAIN MEDINA It does n't smell bad like I thought it would smell . Blood smells like dirt  --  like soil , I mean . Not nasty like garbage , but like the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still alive .
