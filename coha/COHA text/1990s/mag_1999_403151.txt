New products and programs can quadruple your chances of success . // IF YOU 'RE among the millions of smokers who resolve to quit each New Year 's Day , only to find yourself a few days later dejectedly puffing away , take heart . A revolution in medical understanding of how smokers get hooked has led to new approaches to quitting that can increase your chances of success from the 5% typical of cold-turkey quitters to 20% or more . And at least part of the $206 billion tobacco settlement will go to funding programs to help you . Recent studies provide clues to why breaking an addiction to nicotine is so difficult-even more difficult than kicking heroin or cocaine , according to Steven Adelman , medical director of substance abuse services for Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates . Nicotine stimulates brain cells to release a pleasure-inducing chemical called dopamine . " Each puff of a cigarette is a hit , a neurobiological miniorgasm that is repeated millions of times , which explains why smokers yearn for that experience much longer than people addicted to many other pleasure-giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cravings , doctors and counselors have come to rely on various forms of nicotine replacementfrom the now familiar skin patches to the cigarette-like Nicotrol Inhaler introduced last year . And the new drug Zyban targets the pathways of nicotine addiction in the brain , rather than replacing nicotine . The table at right details the cost , side effects and percentages of smokers who are still off cigarettes a year after quitting while using each of these products . Although you may see ads touting a product 's success among those who 've used it for a month or two , the one-year success rate is the best indicator of effectiveness , says Richard Merrick , whose 10-week smoking-cessation program at Kaiser Permanente in Harbor City , Calif. has an astounding 57% one-year quit rate . How Zyban helps Richard E. Hurt , director of the Mayo Clinic 's $3,000 eight-day inpatient program , which has helped 43% of its severely addicted clients kick the habit , generally recommends that smokers start taking Zyban-the first pill to be approved by the FDA as a smoking-cessation aidabout a week before they plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an antidepressant called Wellbutrin SR ( the initials stand for sustained release ) , lessens the desire to smoke by raising dopamine levels in the brain , just as cigarettes do . Zyban also whittles the average quitter 's five-pound weight gain . Zyban has no effect on IS% to 20% of smokers who try it , says Linda Ferry , a researcher at Loma Linda University School of Medicine , who first discovered that the drug helped people quit smoking . Experts suggest giving Zyban a one-month trial ; most people take it for 12 weeks . Some health plans do n't cover Zyban , but a few less than forthcoming smokers have gotten around that by asking doctors to diagnose them with depression and prescribe Wellbutrin SR , which is generally covered . Because Zyban carries a slight ( one in 1,000 ) risk of seizures , Harvard Vanguard 's Adelman prefers starting patients off with a nicotine patch . But for smokers who find they crave the ritual and hand-to-mouth activity of smoking , nicotine gum , the inhaler or nasal spray may work better , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest , while the inhaler most closely replicates the act of smoking . The gum 's advantage is that it 's available without a prescription ; most smokers will need the 4mg version . // TOOLS FOR THE WOULD-BE NONSMOKER // To help the most intractable smokers , specialists now combine Zyban with nicotine-replacement products , using double patches or patches plus gum or an inhaler . " Most patches deliver only half the nicotine a smoker would get from one pack a day . So some may find nicotine replacement has n't worked well simply because they 're being underdosed , " says the Mayo Clinic 's Hurt . Some doctors keep patients on the products for several months rather than the 10 to 12 weeks most manufacturers recommend . Photograph 5% Your chances of success if you quit cold turkey // But to avoid dangerously high blood pressure or nicotine overdosing ( 40mg to 60mg is considered lethal , but individual tolerances can vary ) , combining products or straying from dosage instructions should be done only under a doctor 's supervision . And while nicotine replacement is safer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that using nicotine replacement for more than three to six months may damage blood and lung cells , possibly leading to artery disease , bronchitis or both . Why you may need a support group " Smoking is a way of coping with stress as well as of obtaining pleasure , so breaking that psychological addiction is just as crucial as eliminating the physical one , " says Bonnie Spring , a University of Illinois-Chicago psychologist whose programs achieve long-term quit rates of 40% or more . Adding some form of counseling to your quitting plan is essential , says Richard Merrick . Participants in his highly successful Kaiser Permanente program attend Nicotine Anonymous meetings ( 415-750-0328 ) . Merrick says that the group , which applies Alcoholics Anonymous principles to smokers , is the best of the many low-cost or free groups because it offers long-term support . If Nicotine Anonymous does n't meet in your area , both the American Cancer Society ( 800-227-2345 ) and the American Lung Association ( 800-586-4872 ) sponsor counseling programs of four to eight weeks ' duration . What 's coming In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zyban , target brain chemistry There are also novel forms of nicotine replacement , including an under-the-tongue tablet and a lollipop . The market for these drugs is expanding at a rapid pace . In 1998 , sales of overthe-counter nicotine-replacement products exceeded $568 million , according to Information Resources , a Chicagobased marketing research firm . That 's nearly double total sales in 1996 , when these products first became available over the counter . Prescriptions are soaring too . Sales for the 12 months that ended September 1998 totaled $184.4 million , up 154% from the previous year , according to IMS Health , a health-care information company in Plymouth Meeting , Pa . Using smoking-cessation aids as part of a plan you develop with an experienced doctor makes you more likely to reap their full benefits . First , though , talk to your health plan . About 75% of HMOs now cover smoking-cessation products and programs , which may be provided by the plan itself . You can also locate a physician who specializes in smoking cessation by calling the 3,200-member American Society of Addiction Medicine ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
