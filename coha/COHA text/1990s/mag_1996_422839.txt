EACH TIME WE COME HERE THE SNOW IS DEEPER . Today the white blanket swallows my son 's knees ; white puffs rise from his breath . The hem of his orange mesh vest trails his backtrack like a wedding train , catching at the deadfall , collecting bits of stick . The colors of this world are black and white , gray and evergreen . The deer , I tell Tom , will be brown . Their silhouettes will cast horizontal lines in a vertical forest . " It 's a matter of seeing them in context , " I tell him . " That 's what hunting is all about . " Tom is an artist . Tonight , three of his watercolors  --  a red fox , a tiger , and a saw-whet owl  --  will be hung in a downtown gallery . All the other paintings in the show will carry the signatures of adults . Art has given Tom an identity that is rare for a twelve-year-old boy . But his animals are portraits only ; they are animals the way city people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces . Tom is only beginning to paint natural backgrounds and sometimes gets them wrong . His beautifully rendered cheetah , a creature of the open savannah , is racing past a thicket of trees . The context of an animal in its natural world , why it is where it is , when it is , is missing . Last month we sat on a haystack blind while amber grain flared in the sunset and whitetails danced out to feed . At my shot , a doe had collapsed . She turned a circle with her forefoot while six flags went up from the deer that were with her . One paused briefly to sniff her fallen form . At the far rim of the field they stopped to look back . As Tom and I walked into the flow of the grain , the others began once more to feed . He had been surprised to see how perfect the deer was , that she wore nothing but a dime of blood on her shoulder . He held her legs in position while I opened her with the knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silent for a while on the drive back . " It 's okay , " he finally said . " There 's a lot of deer , it 's not like they 're an endangered species . " " Do you want to shoot a deer this fall ? " " Maybe , " he said . Now , on his fifth trip into the mountains , the question remains unanswered . I have made it clear that he is under no pressure to shoot . We hunt for the experience of hunting . If a deer stands for a broadside shot , if I think Tom 's ready , if he feels right about it , he will press the trigger . A lot of " if 's , " and so far the sequence has failed to materialize . Tom could have shot a forkhorn mule deer the first day out , but I did not feel he had hunted hard enough to earn it . In fact , he was happy just to see it , and a mile farther on , pleased to point out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning his attitude seems changed . When we stop to catch our breath , he takes the rifle from me to rest across his knees and dry fire at a stump . I have taped several thicknesses of foam pad to the stock to bring his eye level with the scope ; he carefully removes one of them . He backs the power down from 5X to 3X to gain eye relief , puts the stock to his cheek , then lowers the rifle , nodding to me that he is ready to go . The north slopes are still in shadow when we spot the deer , a buck with one miniscule forked antler . It is across a deep ravine , on the lower slopes of a forested ridge . " Is he close enough ? " Tom asks . His voice quivers , but I do n't know whether it is betraying worry or anticipation . " He would be close enough for me if I had a rest , " I tell him , " but we 'll try to get closer . " The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we skirt the head of the ravine , climb the opposite ridge , and stalk down from above through the pines , we will cut the distance by three-quarters , and Tom will have come that much closer to the pulse of hunting as I know it  --  that heightened sensitivity to nature and the pounding heart that bind us so purposefully to the past . And to the land under our feet . It is a revelation to me how much noise a 70-pound boy can make just by putting weight on his boots , and a reminder that virtually all large predators undergo a learning process by following the example of their parents . Tom snaps a stick and I turn and roll my eyes in exasperation ; he shrugs and smiles self-consciously , but does better as we toe down the hill . As so often happens in hunting , the deer and I spot each other in the same instant . I lower my hand to motion Tom down . The buck is bedded with its back to the bole of a spruce tree . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , were it not for a witch 's web of willow shoots in front of us , Tom would have a shot . I motion for him to turn around . Perhaps if we retreat we can stalk this deer from a better angle . But the moment we move , the buck is gone in a series of stiff bounds . Tom is disappointed . I tell him it is another part of hunting . He has experienced hope and hard work . The third tenet is failure . There will be more of it , I say , a prophesy proved true throughout the day . It is one thing to find deer in these hills  --  in fact it is hard not to  --  but when the rifle is as long as the boy , well ... he ca n't shoot straight without a rest , and taking a rest puts him at eye level with the brush and shin-tangle . By late afternoon we have combed the lower hills , stalked two more bucks , and have yet to get a clear shot at any range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell him . He nods his head , trudging along in my tracks . " Are you sure you want to ? We can go home , maybe come back tomorrow . " I put my hand on his shoulder to make him stop . He looks up at me expectantly . He is still a little boy , but he is a little man , too . I remember a conversation I 'd had with my wife a few weeks ago . " Tom is so soft-hearted , " she had said . " Will it be disappointing to you if he does n't become a hunter ? " Yes , I 'd told her ... and no . For below me I had seen the twinkling stars from the porch lights go on in the valley , drawing a little closer to these hills each fall . I had seen a nation of nonhunters looking down at me with disapproving eyes , and I wondered how many years we had left , the hunter and the hunted , the country itself . Was it worth the heartache to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I knew that it was . But I knew also that I had taken him here in an attempt to make him understand me . If he hunted , I would be happy for us both . But my encouragement should go no further than pointing to tracks in the snow . Only the blood pumping through his veins would motivate him enough to climb higher . " Let 's hunt , " he said , and I stepped aside and handed him the rifle . I motioned him to lead the way . " Horizontal lines , " I reminded him . It was a matter of seeing things in context , for me as well as my son . The buck , bounding from his bed in a thorn thicket below us , raced at an angle that brought him to the crest of the ridge we 'd been climbing . He stood looking down at us , broadside , at 60 yards . Tom dropped to a knee and brought the rifle to his shoulder . " Here , take this for a rest , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air cracked , the rifle recoiled , and the buck reared straight up before racing down the hillside . Gone . Gone before thought . Tom looked scared . He burst out crying . " I wounded him , " he said . I was shaking . Only a breath ago I had been so certain he was ready . Now , it seemed like a tragic mistake . He shot for the wrong reason , to please me . We will find blood on the snow . The deer will die in some lonely nook of forest and Tom will never hunt again . But even as this flood of misgiving raced through my mind , I saw that Tom was starting to compose himself . " The crosshairs looked good , " he said , turning his eyes to me for reassurance . " Then he 's dead , " I told him . We tracked the deer to a pocket of thornbrush and crooked aspens . He had made a mad dash downhill with his heart shot out and flipped onto his back . I grabbed the antlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buck . " I 'm glad he did n't suffer , " Tom said . He stroked his hand down the animal 's sleek flank , then tentatively brought his finger to the point of an antler . Dusting the snow from a log , I waved my glove for him to sit beside me . I had anticipated this moment for a long time , but now that it had come I did n't know what to say . The shot had put a period to the end of an old story , and it occurred to me that maybe it was best if we each contemplated its meaning in silence . Below us , the outlines of the trees were beginning to blur . In the blush of evening , the landscape of the hunt  --  the background that had been missing from Tom 's paintings  --  was starting to fade . We would have to hurry now to dress the deer and get off the mountain in time for the art show . I drew my knife and touched it to a diamond hone . " Paint him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived . " He nodded as we stood to work . It would occur to me only later that in a way which had nothing to do with brush strokes and watercolor paper , he already had . <p>
