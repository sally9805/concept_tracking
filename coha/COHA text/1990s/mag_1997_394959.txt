A desktop weather station to improve your predictions . Photograph // You can keep abreast of weather conditions and the time of day with this attractive desktop weather station . Its mahogany plaque and brass-rimmed instruments are eye-catching , and its compact size allows you to display it just about anywhere . It can even be made to hang on a wall . It consists of a combination barometer/thermometer , a hygrometer and a clock . The barometer/thermometer is useful for predicting local weather trends because it tells you at a glance whether atmospheric pressure is rising or falling . The hygrometer measures the relative humidity , which is the moisture in the air as a percent of what the air is capable of holding at that temperature . And the clock is there to remind you how far behind you are falling ! The project is ideal if you do n't have time for elaborate woodworking and you just want to knock off something in a few hours . It requires few tools , and the plaque is so small that you can make it from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mahogany . But this thickness is only necessary if you plan to hang the weather station on the wall , as the barometer/thermometer is 7/s-in. thick . For a desk set , a 3/4-in. - thick piece will work just fine . Making The Plaque Photograph It 's difficult to see pencil lines on mahogany , so tape the plaque 's pattern to the workpiece . Orient the pattern to produce a pleasing grain pattern . Photograph Cut the curved portion of the plaque to shape using a scroll saw , band saw or sabre saw . The white pattern Is easy to follow . Photograph Remove saw marks using a spokeshave . Move the tool outward from the top of the curve In both directions . // Because pencil lines on mahogany are difficult to see , you 'll find it easier to scroll saw the curved cutting lines if you tape a paper pattern of the plaque onto the workpiece . If you use ribbonstripe mahogany as we did , take a moment to orient the pattern relative to the grain direction ( Photo 1 ) . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an awkward direction relative to the plaque 's shape . Adjust the pattern to achieve a pleasing orientation . Cut the plaque on the scroll saw , or use a band saw or sabre saw . We used a blade with 10 teeth per inch and fed the workpiece into the blade at a moderate rate ( Photo 2 ) . The edges of the workpiece have to be smoothed after sawing . We clamped the workpiece in a vise and removed the saw marks with a razor-sharp spokeshave and worked outward from the curve in both directions ( Photo 3 ) . If you do this properly , you do n't even have to sand the edge after it has been smoothed . If you do n't own a spokeshave , you can use a drum sander in a drill press or even a hand sanding block made from the mahogany scrap . Mounting The Instruments The next step is to cut the holes for the instruments . Lay out the center marks for each instrument , then bore a pilot hole through the workpiece at each center mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the centering bit on the circle cutter . The centering bit is usually 3/8 in. in diameter . Adjust the circle cutter for a 25/6-in. - dia. hole . Then , clamp the workpiece firmly in place and bore the hole , making a partial cut from both sides ( Photo 4 ) . Although mahogany is not a particularly hard wood , do n't run the drill press higher than 600 rpm , or medium speed , in order to avoid burning the wood . Next , use a router to make the stopped molded cuts on the plaque edges ( Photo 5 ) . To achieve these cuts , tack nail four corner blocks to a plywood panel . Each block should stop the travel of the router when the router bit 's pilot bearing strikes it . The blocks also prevent the router from tipping as you near the end of the cut . It 's important that the blocks be the same thickness as the workpiece . If the blocks are slightly thicker than the workpiece , the router base will catch on them and you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the router bumps into the stopblock and you jostle the router to ride over the block . Cut the T-slot hole for hanging the plaque using a keyhole router bit chucked in the drill press ( Photo 6 ) . Again , run the drill press at medium speed . Cut down into the workpiece with the bit , then switch off the power and lock the quill in the down position . Turn the drill press on again and push the workpiece back slightly to make the undercut slot . Omit this step if you want to make the weather station a desk accessory . Each instrument is secured in its hole with a flanged mounting ring that bears against a rabbet cut on the back of the hole . To cut the rabbet , use a 3%-in. - dia. router bit set to make a 1/2-in. - deep cut ( Photo 7 ) . Photograph Clamp the workplece firmly while using a circle cutter to make the holes .

Photograph Hold the workpiece firmly In place , and cut a rabbet around the mounting hole 's circumference using a router and rabbet bit . Photograph Before finishing the weather station , test fIt the three Instruments and their mounting rings . // Before sanding and finishing , test the instruments and rings for fit ( Photo 8 ) . The barometer/thermometer ( Part No. 46K50.12 , $13.95 ) , the clock ( Part No. 46K50.22 , $19.95 ) and the hygrometer ( Part No. 46K50.02 , $6.95 ) can be ordered from Lee Valley Tools Ltd. , P.O. Box 1780 , Ogdensburg , NY 13669 ; 800-871-8158 . Include $6 for shipping with the order . To make the desktop stand , cut the pieces as shown in the plan . Bore and countersink the two holes for the No. 8 screws in the upright , then attach it to the base with glue and nails . Next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back of the plaque . Then , press a screw through each hole to mark the position of the pilot holes in the back of the plaque . Bore lA-in.deep pilot holes using a /4-in. - dia. bit . Attach the stand to the plaque and proceed with finishing . Sand the plaque with progressively finer sandpaper , from 120-grit to 220-grit . Remove sanding dust with a tack cloth and apply three coats of polyurethane on the front and back of the project . Allow each coat of finish to harden thoroughly before sanding it with 220-grit paper and applying the next coat . Install the instruments , and you 're ready to predict the weather . <p>
