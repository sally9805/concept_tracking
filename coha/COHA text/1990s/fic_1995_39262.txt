Jen and I were driving through New Mexico with her father , who was a retired insurance guy just a few years older than me , a tall , thin guy with a swatch of white hair that slipped across his scalp as if it had fallen there from a tree . Jen thought this trip would be a good way to introduce me to her father , but on the second day things remained a little stiff , and Jen was still interpreting . <p> It had been raining most of the day , and when we drove into Carlsbad , New Mexico , late in the afternoon , the streets were flooded . It turned out we were some distance from the caverns , which I thought were right outside of town , but which were actually twenty-five miles south . The sun was nearly down , but there was still light buried in the thick clouds patrolling above us . The water washing over the curbs in town was metallic copper , reflecting clouds and sky together . We stopped at a four-way , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caverns . We did n't get far . Jen signaled and pulled into the Holiday Inn , then went inside and registered for two rooms side by side on the second floor . We parked and carried the bags up , then stood for a couple minutes on the concrete balcony , talking about dinner . Jen wanted room service , and that was fine with me , but Mike wanted to go for Chinese . <p> " Not me , " Jen said , going into our room . " You guys go ahead . I 'm resting . I 'm taking a shower and watching TV . " <p> " What about it , Del ? " Mike said . <p> " Sure , " I said . <p> Jen gave her father a little kiss on the cheek , only the second time I 'd seen her do that , and went into our room . <p> Mike gestured for me to follow him into his room . I did n't want to go , of course . I wanted to go in with Jen and relax and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're supposed to have the conversation with the girlfriend 's father always arrive , even at my age . <p> Mike tossed his suitcase on one of his beds and sat in the wonderfully generic chair next to the generic table , slapping the arm of the second chair . " Take a seat , " he said . " I 've been looking forward to having a chance to get with you one-on-one , know what I mean ? Know what I mean , Del ? " <p> " Sure , " I said . <p> " So you 're teaching at the college over there in Biloxi ? And teaching is something you like to do , is that right ? " Mike said . <p> " I do n't mind it , " I said . " It 's good work . It 's worthwhile work , sort of . In a small way . It 's interesting , pays the bills . " <p> " It 's a fine career , teaching , " Mike said . " It 's a real commitment to society , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " <p> " I 'm not shorting myself , " I said . <p> " Well , I mean , it 's important , " he said . <p> " Yes , I guess it is , " I said . <p> " These kids need to be educated . Even Jen needs to be educated  --  she 's got her degree , but she could use another one . Another degree never hurt anybody . " <p> " We talked about that , " I said . " About her going back to school , getting a graduate degree . Maybe art , we were thinking . " <p> " You talked about it ? " <p> " Yep . Sure did . " <p> " Huh , " he said . " Think of that . " <p> I noticed there was a spot on the arm of the chair where somebody must 've stuck gum or something , and then somebody else had come along and scraped it off , leaving a little around-the-edges residue . <p> " Well , we ca n't all be tycoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us just stay in the shadows , sneak by . Skirt the edges , economically speaking . " <p> " It 's not economics I 'm worried about , Del , " Mike said . " I do n't know how to get into this , but perhaps I 'll just come out and say it , okay ? As I understand it , you 're about  --  " <p> " Forty-seven , " I said . " But I think young . " <p> Mike did a polite laugh . " Anyway , what I was wondering was , see , I 'm fifty-three , and there you are with my daughter , and she 's twenty-six or twenty-seven  --  " <p> " Seven , " I said . <p> " Right . So , does n't that seem a little odd to you ? I do n't want to be forward about this , and I do n't want to cause trouble , but it worries me , I do n't mind telling you . I mean , I figured it would be best to tell you straight out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's kind of you , " I said . <p> " What ? " he said . <p> " Not beating around the bush , " I said . " So many people these days beat around the bush , the poor bush does n't have a prayer , know what I mean , Mike ? " <p> He yanked at the leg of his pants . " Not me , not my style at all , but I 'm already retired , so I guess I would n't . Know , I mean . " <p> " Well , Jen was a surprise to me , too , " I said . " I 'm divorced , and at first it was just a friendly thing , and then  --  " <p> " That 's not the way Jennifer said it was , " he said . <p> " What 's that ? " I said . <p> " A friendly thing , " he said . <p> " Well , I meant it was n't serious . I did n't know it was serious , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winked at me then , one of those winks where the message is " Know what this means ? " I was not doing as well as I would have liked . <p> " No , no  --  not what I meant . I just did n't know what was going on . Now that we 've been together a couple of years , well , we 're comfortable together . " <p> " Well , the both of you are comfortable , then , " Mike said . " That 's worth something . " <p> He was around behind the chair now , leaning on its back , his arms folded . He was picking at his teeth with the nail of his thumb . " Comfortable . I like to see that , but I 'm not sure . I mean , I 'm wondering if you might  --  I do n't want to be pushy here  --  sort of stand to one side , or try that , so Jennifer can go on with her life . Unless you see yourself as , well , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Right , " he said . <p> " Well , I see that , yes . She sees that , I think . So that 's why I do n't get off to one side , as you say . We 're sort of keeping company in a serious way . " <p> " Keeping company . Now I have n't heard that since I was a kid , when my pappy used to talk about that . I think he used to talk about keeping company . That 's nice , the way you use that , " he said . <p> " Well , thank you , " I said . <p> There was a long pause while he picked his teeth and looked down into the seat of the chair , which was beige . Then he straightened his arms and looked at the TV . The TV was n't on . <p> " That Simpson thing 's a mess out there , I 'm telling you . I do n't like it . You think he did it ? " he said . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , that 's right , " I said . <p> " I do n't know  --  you know that dog and everything , that dog found them , " he said . <p> " Yep , " I said . <p> " I do n't know , " Mike said , doing a little tight stretch with his shoulders , trying to move them forward . " I guess I 'd better jump over and say good night to Jen . But I 'm glad we had this talk . <p> mean , it did n't go all that far , but I feel better , anyway . We 've had a little talk and maybe we could have another one later , you know ? Build up to something . " <p> " Sure , " I said . " That 'd be good for me . " <p> " Let 's schedule that . Let 's pencil that in . After golf . You play golf ? " <p> " No , I do n't , really , " I said . " I played golf when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I was on the golf team in high school . We were pretty fair golfers there in Houston at high school . But since then , I have n't played much . Golf 's not my game , really . " <p> " So what is your game ? " he said . <p> " Well , I do n't really have a game , " I said . " When I was younger , I liked various games . I liked archery . " <p> He gave me a look when I said archery . <p> " Well , I ca n't help it . I liked it , " I said . " Shooting those arrows , that was fun . They shot across and hit those targets . Football and baseball , of course . I played Little League . Played grade school football . " <p> " You did n't play high school ? " he said . " You 're a big guy  --  probably a big kid , were n't you ? " <p> " Well , yeah , I was , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did n't you ? " he said . <p> " I did n't want to , " I said . " I decided in eighth grade that I did n't want to play football . I had an idiot coach . " <p> " Everybody has an idiot coach in eighth grade , " Mike said . <p> " This guy was sort of Vince Lombardi with that gay-jock conflict thing going . He had us line up and smack each other in the face before games  --  that sort of thing . Slug each other in the stomach as hard as we could . Get one kid to jump on another kid . That was always me , the one getting jumped . So I quit . " <p> " Bet he did n't like that , " he said . <p> " He told the other kids I was scared . Called me names . I saw him once a few years ago in a surplus store with his friend . I 'm bigger than he is now , so I do n't expect he 'd call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school deal . This guy was still closeted . Liked to watch the little boys shower . " <p> " So that 's when you turned to archery ? " Mike said . <p> " I did n't turn to archery . I was just interested in archery , " I said . <p> " Were you any good at it ? " Mike said . <p> " No , " I said . " Bowling . I was pretty good at bowling . Now , there you go . That 's my sport , bowling . " <p> " I always hated bowling , " Mike said . <p> We went to our room together , and after Mike said good night to Jen , he gave up the Chinese food idea and decided to get a sandwich in the restaurant . I said I 'd pass and Mike did n't seem to mind , so I let him out of the room and locked up after him . <p> The comforters on the beds were abnormally plump . The television was a brand-new bottom-of-the-line RCA . I popped through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shower , then came out and started to undress . I liked to watch her dress and undress because she always acted like she was alone . That made it sexier , as if I was watching her strip on television , or I was n't there at all and she was just changing , getting ready for bed , or for a date  --  as if she were completely vulnerable . And I liked how she handled the clothes when she took them off . She was neither too casual nor too precious with them . She put them down carefully but not too carefully . She folded her jeans , then folded them again . She draped her shirt over the back of a chair . She put her socks and shoes at attention at the foot of the chair . She looked good in her underpants . She looked healthy and young and a tiny bit awkward . Her skin was only lightly freckled . Her back curved in a pretty way . Her breasts were small and delicate , suggesting adolescence , just hinting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She slid her hands through her hair to freshen it , then stretched out for a minute on the second bed , her hands by her sides , her eyes shut . I got up and went into the bath to turn off the shower for her , and stopped to kiss her forehead when I came back , then sat down and started going soundlessly through the channels again . <p> " Thank you , " Jen said , without opening her eyes . She reached down and pulled the flap of the comforter up on the side of the bed and over her chest and legs . <p> " Do you want me to wake you ? " I said . <p> " Yes , " she said . " Forty-five minutes . No more than that . " <p> I switched to CNN and watched various muted lawyers in studios talk about the Simpson case . Earnest questions were asked by the news anchor ( his face gave him away ) , and earnest answers were given by the consultants . In the courtroom replays , I spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing on her lip , the mole . I was glad I did n't have to listen to her shrill , officious , self-righteous version of justice . <p> I must have come in late on the Simpson report , because soon after they were on to Rwanda . The most horrifying pictures imaginable , thousands of people in a burned-out , mud-caked landscape with diseased water seeping in dark pools , the kind you see animals wallowing in , flies and bugs and people on the ground curled up suffering , wrapped in rags , smoke rising on the horizon , trees stripped of limbs and leaves , sagging huts , tents , people on stretchers , people being pulled by mules , ghastly , freakish , grotesquely maimed people wandering through the filth . Six one-armed boys in matching brown shorts . I wondered why we were n't more active in Rwanda . People all over the country , all over the world , were thinking exactly that thought , but none of us were doing much  --  we were going to wonder and wait for the next news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over there and not going , and all of them seemed designed to make me feel more guilty or less guilty . Only the simple go made any sense , so I took credit for being able to recognize that , but then decided the recognition was another rationalization , another trick . Then I figured I was too hard on myself , I could n't be expected to do everything , or even any particular thing , and that all the guilt was itself an easy out  --  learned in Catholic boyhood . <p> There was nowhere to go with the cycle of guilt and relief , so <p> started wondering why the country had n't done something about Rwanda . The massacre had been going on for months and months . I 'd read about it in the papers , seen it on the news , it seemed like four or five months before . Eight months . How was it that a country , a powerful country , a country committed to decency , compassion , and kindness , routinely sat on its hands while tragedies unfolded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . First a few little stories in the press , then more stories , and pretty soon earnest concern , and then grave concern , and then elaborate grave concern while many things were thought of and many people died . And then the crisis took a turn for the worse , and there was even graver concern , and there were more deaths and more stories . And then the crisis took an additional turn for the worse , and perhaps a third , and the process was repeated until what we were fed on the nightly news was a scene of incomprehensible agony . That 's when the camera people did their lovely , lingering close-ups of the survivors , the new pictures matched with the hugely solemn voice-overs of the announcers . <p> I wondered what they thought of the camera people . <p> The eyes of these survivors always showed an inexplicable determination to live . I looked at them on television and thought , Why are n't you dead ? How do you manage to want not to die ? In that hotel room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes . <p> Then it struck me that if they were in my shoes they would be sitting in a swanky Rwanda hotel watching me on their big screen TVs as I slogged through a urine-and-feces-strewn America , and they 'd be thinking how bad they felt for not helping me out , they 'd be wondering why their country did n't do something . They 'd consider doing something ineffective and insufficient themselves , like TV news reporting of the tragedy in America , or gathering medical supplies , or writing torrid op-ed pieces in The Rwanda Times , or just feeling guilty about not doing anything  --  the usual tricks we play on ourselves so we feel less guilty about good fortune . I figured they would n't lift a finger and they 'd wonder about that look in my eyes . <p> " He 's a really nice man , " Jen said . " He feels he 's missed something . He has n't , as far as I can tell , but he thinks it , anyway . He 's so cut off from everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caverns , a space the size of several Astrodomes , as the literature was eager to point out , seven hundred feet underground . Mike had gone on ahead of us . Jen could n't see too well , so she was holding on to my arm as we walked the path . It was cold in there , too cold to be comfortable . <p> The other cavernites were running around taking snapshots of every weird-shaped chunk of rock they could find , using their point-and-shoots to good advantage , so there were flashes everywhere . Curious formations dropped out of the ceiling , grew out of the floor . The path , lined with a foot-high pipe railing , rose and sank as it weaved through the cave . <p> " What 'd he miss ? " I said to Jen . " What does he think he missed ? " <p> " By my reckoning , it 's Sting , mostly , " she said . " He got married thirty years ago and lived the right life as long as he could . After the divorce he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this time . And here you come along with his little girl . " <p> " So ? " I said . <p> " Produces doubts , " she said . She grabbed my arm as we went up over a rise next to a rock formation that looked like a giant breast . The room was full of echoes . We could see the silhouettes of people on the other side of the cave coming back along the end of the same trail we had just started on  --  it looped around the perimeter of the Big Room . Every word spoken in the cave rippled around the rocks . It sounded like nighttime , flooded with delicate echoes and little bits of laughter and the odd drop of water into a standing pool , the footsteps fast and slow , children running on the path , people talking in foreign languages explaining the sights to one another , the wheezing of thirty-five millimeter autowinders . <p> " So what do you want me to do ? " I said . " You want me to apologize for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jen said . " Is that how we think of ourselves today ? " <p> " Okay , forget I said it , " I said . <p> " Does all this stuff look phony to you ? " she said , waving at the rock structures growing out of the ceiling and out of the floor . " Does it look a little bit like papier-mache in here , or is that my imagination ? " <p> This had been bothering me , too . Maybe it was just because we were in the Big Room , the one easily accessible by elevator seventy stories below the visitors center , and that we had n't walked in through the natural entrance , down through the Bat Cave , Whale 's Mouth , Devil 's Den , Iceberg , Green Lake , Queen 's Chamber , and the other evocatively named rooms and halls of the natural path down to the Big Room . Or maybe it was that they 'd over-cleaned the place , what with the lamps and pathways and signs and the little multilingual hand-held , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four and a half dollars . Whatever it was , the cavern looked too well groomed for me , too much like a life-size model of a real cavern that might be somewhere else , hidden away , out of public view , inaccessible save to government scientists , leaving this cleaned , polished , carefully manicured national park service engineer 's idea of Carlsbad Caverns . <p> " Yeah , looks phony , " I said . " But these big guys do look like walruses , do n't they ? " I was pointing to walrus-shaped rock formations . <p> " Some do , " she said . <p> We were just then passing a place on our right called Mirror Lake . The cavern keepers had put an upside-down lighted sign just above this tiny puddle , so that when you looked into the puddle the words Mirror Lake appeared right-side-up and rippling on the surface of this bit of water . The pool could n't have been more than eight feet across , two feet deep , but in the Big Room of this putative Carlsbad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean , right ? " I said . <p> " Yep . I could do that in my tub . " <p> " Well , so much for silent chambers and timeless beauty , " I said . <p> " I think we 've been deeply injured by our time , " Jen said . " I really wanted this to be wonderful . If you repeat this , I 'll deny it , but this morning when I got up , I was excited about coming down here . Maybe if there were a little more dirt around , if we tripped on rocks and stuff ? " <p> " That would help , " I said . " Maybe you should go down into the unexplored part . If you 're young and energetic , and you are , and you pay the Jen dollars or whatever it takes , you get to see an unspoiled , un-dioramatized version of a cavern . " <p> " Do you suppose they 've got all this dramatic lighting down there ? " Jen said . <p> " Go back two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Sorry , " she said . <p> " After you factor out the trails and the lights and garden-club beautification , it 's still okay , is n't it ? " I said . " It really is kind of remarkable . " <p> " Yes , of course it is , " Jen said . " You did n't think I was saying it was un , did you ? " <p> " Who knew ? " I said . <p> " I 'm saying I wish it were a little more undisturbed . And I do n't think the theatrical lighting helps much . In fact , it kind of hurts . It 's hard to see anything down here . Ordinary lighting would be better . " <p> " You 're the matter-of-fact kid , are n't you ? " I said . <p> " So what if I am ? " she said . <p> " You ca n't blame them . It 's a precious national resource . All precious national resources are lighted this way . Have you ever seen the Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live to decorate , " she said . <p> Jen sat down to rest on a stone bench in the middle of the cavern . I sat down beside her . The bench was cold . A Chinese family was there with us , speaking in hushed but rapid Chinese . A plump mother , a diminutive father , and two gorgeous , lanky , silk-haired Chinese girls in their teens . The parents were eagerly discussing the scenery . One of the kids was staring at her hand , and the second was reading what appeared to be a comic book , using a flashlight the size of a Pez dispenser . A tall guy , an American , came up behind us and was talking to the people he was with , telling them all about the cavern , explaining everything , challenging the people in his party to answer questions : When was the cavern discovered ? What was its principal value then ? When did it become a national park ? What is the role of water in the formation of the rock structures ? How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canyon carved itself come into being ? <p> Jen poked me in the ribs with her elbow . " Quit staring , " she whispered . " He 's going to call on us . " <p> We got up and walked along the trail past some kind of wire ladder that dropped out of sight into a hole in the cavern floor , then past another hole called the Jumping Off Place , then past a hole called the Bottomless Pit . <p> " Throw yourself in , " I heard somebody say . <p> " This pit is n't bottomless at all , " somebody else said . " Look . It 's only one hundred fifty feet deep or something . " <p> " Is not , " somebody else said . <p> " Read the sign , " somebody said . <p> It was much darker and colder in this part of the cave . We hurried along the trail , arm in arm . <p> " How is it you know so much about what Mike 's thinking ? " I said . <p> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad language . He 's my dad . " <p> The smart guy had come up behind us again , and he was doing a quiz on bats . " So how do they manage to hang upside down ? " he asked his kids . " When they 're sleeping ? " <p> " Yeah , " one of the kids said . " How do they do that ? " <p> " Magnets , " another one of the kids said . <p> " Do n't be smart , Junior , " the father said . " The answer is that when a bat hangs upside down with its feet closed onto something , its feet are in their natural condition , just as our hands are when they are open . See ? When our hands are open , they 're relaxed , and when a bat 's feet are closed , they 're relaxed . It 's as if our hands were closed when they were at rest , but for the bat , relaxed is closed and open is working , like our hands would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? When the bat relaxes , its feet close . " <p> " You mean bat feet are like clothespins ? " one of the kids said . <p> " Like clothespins , " the father said , obviously a bit flustered . " Well , I guess so . Yes . " <p> We stood aside on the trail and let them pass . We were looking at a small tableau , draperies of stalagmites and other formations called soda straws , which made up an attractive altar-sized indentation off the main path . <p> " Those little ones look like prairie dogs Jen said . " See that one there ? " She pointed to a little knot of rock that looked like a prairie dog standing on its hind legs . " They 're just gathered around listening to Prairie Dog 's Home Companion . " <p> " We 've got to get out of here , " I said . <p> " What ? You 're not having fun ? " she said . <p> " I 'm freezing , " I said . <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all these astonishingly beautiful and delicate objects ? " <p> " I 'm buying the video , " I said . " Let 's speed it up , okay ? " <p> And that 's what we did , taking the rest of the trail at a near trot , passing up the smart guy and his kids , the Chinese family , some other people we 'd seen along the way . We even passed Mike , who was leaning against some rocks , looking up at the ceiling of the Big Room . <p> " We 'll be in the lunch area , " Jen said , as we went by him . <p> " Okay , great , " Mike said . " I 'm going at my own pace , and I think I 'm going to be all right  --  you kids enjoy yourselves . " <p> " We may be topside , " I said , pointing up with a thumb . <p> He gave me a thump on the shoulder , and Jen kissed him loud on the cheek , and then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the cavern with a fifties-looking concrete concession stand at the bottom of it , the architecture reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright 's Johnson 's Wax office building . We shared a quick Coke and a candy bar and then got in line at the elevator , waiting to go up . <p> " This is like the minus seventy-fifth floor , right ? " Jen said , as we were waiting . <p> A bald guy in front of us turned around with his video camera , videoed us . Jen made some faces for him and introduced me as Tack Ruby . <p> " You remember Tack Ruby , do n't you ? " she said to the video camera . <p> The bald guy stopped shooting and stood up . " Sure . I saw the movie , kind of a mob intermezzo . " <p> " You look a lot like Tom Noonan , " Jen said . <p> " You should see how I feel , " the guy said . <p> When we got back up to the visitors center , we stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comb with Carlsbad Caverns engraved in its spine . Jen bought a chrome and red and white decal . Then we went outside and sat on a stone fence in the warm and gentle sun . It was perfect up there . This little breeze was around . <p>
