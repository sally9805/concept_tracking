NO ONE IS SURE WHEN THE trial will begin . Maybe this fall , maybe early next year . First there are the months of pretrial motions . Depending on whether it 's your side that makes them or theirs , the motions are either essential preliminaries or cynical delaying tactics . But as the nation marks the first anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing , the locus of that bitter and confounding episode is shifting to the eventual trial scene in Denver . Since federal courts do n't ordinarily permit cameras , some families of the victims who wo n't be making the almost 600-mile trip from Oklahoma City are petitioning for special closed-circuit coverage . The defendants , Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols , were moved last month from Oklahoma to a medium-security prison about 16 miles from the Denver courthouse . McVeigh told TIME that he prefers the new accommodations . <P> Meanwhile , the ceaselessly humming brain center for McVeigh 's defense is elsewhere still , in Enid , Oklahoma , 68 miles northwest of Oklahoma City . On the 11th floor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown , are the offices of Stephen Jones , McVeigh 's court-appointed attorney . <P> Though Jones likes to call himself a " county-seat " lawyer , he spent part of his career in New York ( as a young lawyer working for Richard Nixon ) and another part in Washington as a congressional aide . His thinking does n't stop at the county line . Prosecutors , led by Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Hartzler , plan to lay the crime squarely at the feet of Nichols and McVeigh , two Army buddies immersed in the furies and paranoia of the extreme right wing . Jones plans to go global , arguing to the jury that his client is just a pawn in a conspiracy so vast that even he 's not sure yet just what it is . <P> Outside the defense team , the common view is that the mind-boggling scope of the case is allowing Jones to fashion theories of whatever kind . Federal investigators have already turned over to the defense more than 21,000 witness statements , more than 400 hours of videotapes from various surveillance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kansas that were taken by intelligence agencies . " It 's the largest criminal investigation in the history of the U.S. , " Jones points out . " Larger than Kennedy 's death , larger than Oswald by any standard . " <P> He means to make it even bigger . Over the past three months , Jones and a team of investigators have traveled in the U.S. , Asia , the Middle East , Mexico and Europe to find evidence and experts of their own . ( Because Jones is court-appointed , he conducts his research at the taxpayers ' expense , just as the prosecution does . Records showing how much he has spent will remain sealed until after the trial . ) What Jones is after is support for a conspiracy theory  --  or is it several theories ?  --  in which Middle Eastern terrorists , German rightists and homegrown white supremacists are all brought onstage . And where Tim McVeigh gets lost in the crowd scenes . Jones appears to hope that he can persuade the jury that even if his client was involved with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the triggerman in a larger plot .
