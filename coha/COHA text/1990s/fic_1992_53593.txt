ROBERT WAYNE STAYED in a coma for almost two years before something in him finally gave out and he died . Selena , his mother , would sit by the hospital bed for hours , prattling and shaking . When she needed a drink , she would get up and go into the little bathroom there by his bed , nervously watching for nurses , and pull the bottle , wrapped in a handkerchief , from her pocketbook . She never took more than one little drink at a time . <p> She was n't clear in her own mind that he could n't open his eyes , probably could n't hear her , and she did n't want him to know she drank . <p> " I 've had troubles in my life , " she would say , but she still did n't want them to see her drinking . Her stealth had become habit , and personality . <p> Each time she went into the room , she could smell the loose , low smell that sick people have , that hospitals always have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with him until the smell soaked into her hair , her clothes , her skin , even the handkerchief . Finally , when someone would think to go find her , to get her and take her on back home , the smell would be pervasive , and whichever of the other children came to fetch her would leave all the car windows open to try to get away from it . Selena always smelled the hospital now ; it was in her nose , and she could taste it . Even the whiskey did n't take it away . <p> There were times when she would forget all about him , forget where he was , and she would n't go near the hospital for three or four days . One day she complained to Estelle that Robert Wayne had n't been by to see her , and when she caught herself and stopped , guiltily , Estelle looked at her with such mute pity that she commenced to cry . <p> Estelle had come home to live with Selena and Palmer , and was pregnant again . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so Estelle had loaded everything she had into the back seat of her old car and come home . She had been pregnant , Selena did n't know how many times , but , for one reason or the other , never had actually had a baby . What a blessing , Selena thought . <p> Oh , it would have been fine if they had n't had to leave the farm . Everything would have been fine . Even with the peacocks crying . <p> There had been many farms then , long bright fields full of growing , and houses full of windows and breezes . Their place had once been part of Miss Pritchie 's farm , but Selena 's grandfather had bought the land outright . Their farmhouse was fine and light and smelled of biscuits , or making jam , or Granny 's talcum powder , and when it rained , you could sit by a window that reached to the floor and watch the whole world get wet , maybe even cold , but you 'd never , ever be wet or cold yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the old days . Even when Selena was a child , she was from the old days . She was the one who lived in the old house that you would turn to look at , the one with the boxwood lane that led up to it . You could smell the boxwood smell all around the cool shade by the front door when everywhere else sweltered in the summer heat , and you could hide there while your mother visited . There were fences and hedges , dozens of tulip poplars , and an orchard , just beyond the kitchen , where peacocks strutted . Even back then no one really lived like that anymore , and someone should have explained this to Selena : that it was bound to end . <p> By the time Palmer first came ambling down the road , too brave with drinking to notice the kind of people her people were , and too full of himself to know his place , Selena was almost alone . Selena 's mother lay on the sofa all day in a dress that Selena had ironed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's father was dead . Palmer came asking for work ; Selena 's mother nodded yes and pointed to the yard behind the kitchen , where the calf had pushed through the fence , and where the henhouse door would n't catch . He fixed them , and other things that had n't been fixed for a while ; then each day at noon he would sit by the creek below the house and watch the water slide over the little dam . He would eat biscuits left over from breakfast ; Selena made the biscuits now , and she got to where she saved him a piece of ham to put on them , and he got Selena to marry him . <p> If her mother had n't been so sick she could have told Selena not to do it , and Selena would n't have . Her father had wanted her to marry someone with a farm of his own ; he knew men in other counties with sons , and he would have put Selena in front of them , but he had died suddenly and too early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family would have expected , and she forgot until it was too late to expect something for Selena , to realize that she would have to see about getting Selena settled . She could n't imagine that maybe Selena would never have what she had , a farm that was paid for and a fine , pretty house with windows . <p> The windows brought in a cool breeze all summer , a cross-breeze that kept the white curtains moving in a perpetual sigh . There was enough room to twirl around in the middle of the floor , making her skirts rise and float around her like a dancer 's . She would be dressed for church , with a headband and sash of lemon yellow , the sash tied in back in a bow with points trailing like the petals of a daylily . She would spin around in her white skirts on the shiny old wood floors , with the billowy white curtains moving softly at the windows ; and she felt good , and pretty , and belonged there . <p> But her father died and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than to marry . <p> When she went down to the creek that day , Palmer was sitting in the shade , watching a snapping turtle out in the sun by the water 's edge . <p> " Did you know that this here creek was full of snapping turtles ? " he had asked her . <p> " Why , yes , " she said ; of course she had known . Her Granny had told her . <p> " He could snap this here in half before you could blink , " he said , twirling a stick between two fingers . " If he ever got your finger between his jaws , he would n't let go till it thundered . That 's a fact . " <p> As he said this , Palmer watched Selena . She , however , watched the old turtle , old as the house , probably , blinking in the sun ; he looked too sleepy to be out in the brightness , and Selena suddenly felt sleepy herself . <p> She sat down in the grass that smelled like mowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so sleepy that she could n't move , could n't speak . But she remembered , as she dozed there , all there was to know about snapping turtles . <p> As a child , Selena was n't allowed to walk down to the creek by herself ; the water was deep by the dam , and girls did n't swim , back then  --  well , not usually , for where would they learn ? The boys could n't teach you , not unless they were your brothers . But Selena 's grandmother would walk with her to the creek , and they would sit in the sun , both of them , and take off their shoes , and Granny her stockings , cotton the color of skin . They would both dangle their feet in the water and watch as the little twigs they threw in rushed away over the little dam , disappearing for a moment into the deepness , and popping up to the surface again a few feet away . Granny would let her sit there as long as she liked , swinging her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would talk . <p> Sometimes Selena would put her head in Granny 's lap and feel her clean-smelling cotton housedress against her cheek , and she would sleep . She would wake up slowly , and Granny would still be watching the water . Once in a while a little weasel would slide down the far bank  --  the weasels got in the henhouse sometimes , and sucked the eggs  --  and there would always be a turtle or two dozing , like Selena , in the sun . Granny would n't let Selena play with the turtles ; if one got your finger , it would n't let go until it thundered . That 's what she remembered Granny saying to her . <p> Selena was n't frightened by any of this . To hear Granny tell it , it was all so natural , a part of the fields , and of the farm , and of the creek , and it was no stranger than the peacocks ' cries . <p> Sometimes at breakfast , while the grownups sat with coffee , the peacocks would come up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to side , with their incredible , shimmering mantles too wonderful for their ordinary little heads . Selena 's mother would say to them all , " Do n't look at them , do n't look at them ! You know that 'll just make them strut , " and she would turn away , almost embarrassed , but Selena would run to the window , and Granny would laugh . Later , Selena and Granny would walk through the orchard looking for fallen feathers . During molting season , they would come back with an armful and arrange them in vases , like flowers . <p> Selena would walk by herself around the orchard , too , collecting things to play with . Some mornings it smelled so good outside that Selena would almost dance . She would find another peacock feather and wave it over her head , pretending to be a queen or a great lady . She would come home with a pocketful of little rocks and arrange them in secret patterns on the floor of her room . She pretended they were magic stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come true . <p> At night , as she slept , she heard the peacocks cry . <p> Her sleep was deep and the peacocks ' cries were just part of the night , never woke her , never scared her . Selena could sleep without moving , could hear without waking , and even when her mother came and lay a hand on her forehead , she never moved . Her mother would look down on her ; the breeze stirred the shadows , and the light from the back porch would make patterns on the wall that almost looked like her mother 's dark flowered dress . Everything was soft and dark and sweet , and she knew all this , yet never woke . <p> So she slept that day in the sun by the creek , and Palmer asked her to marry him . He told her he would keep the farm like a showplace , and he pointed out that the house needed painting . She heard him , but she could n't really think what he meant ; what she really listened to was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little dam . She sat there in the sun , wanting to sleep . She wanted to sleep until everything was all right again , until her Daddy came back , and her Mama was well , and she did n't have to figure out anything anymore . <p> She finally walked up to the house , where her mother lay frail in her cotton dress , sleeping , with a little soft puddle on the pillow by her mouth , and Selena saw that she could not figure it out for her either , and what else was there to do ? <p> So she married him , and not a soul spoke to her about it , to say not to do it . By this time , her mother was so sick that she slept all the time , and finally , one morning , she was dead . Miss Pritchie came over and took care of things . <p> At the funeral , Selena had looked at Palmer sitting beside her , stiff in a suit that had been her Daddy 's , and could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she felt hot , and crowded . <p> Selena got pregnant almost immediately , like the baby had been there all the time , just waiting . Palmer was proud of that , and said he hoped for a boy , saying he would need to raise good hands to keep his farm up . When the taxes came due , and Selena and Palmer did n't have it , he went off to town to talk to the bank . That 's when he found out he had n't married himself a farm that was clear after all , and he came home drunk . He swore a little , and would n't eat his supper . That night , for the first time in Selena 's life , the peacocks woke her up . She sat up in bed and listened to the cries that sounded like women trapped outside in the darkness . Looking out the window she saw a light moving quietly , stopping , moving again , and she knew Palmer was sitting on the orchard fence , smoking . <p> Miss Pritchie bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then called Palmer in and in a very businesslike way asked if she could retain his services to live on the place and work it , make it profitable . Selena went on living in her house and did n't feel the difference , could n't have told you what made such a difference to Palmer . That first baby was a boy . He was big-boned and long , and had Palmer 's dark reddish hair , almost down to his eyebrows . <p> Two more babies came , and then they quit coming , and Selena was glad . None of them looked like they could be hers , and when she wiped their square faces with a washrag and saw that their thick skin still looked dirty , she wanted to push them away and run . The middle one was a girl , Estelle , as big-boned and clumsy as the boys , but sweet-natured . The oldest one was Claude , and Robert Wayne was the baby . <p> There was so much to do , with all these children ; it was always time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the house clean . The billowy white curtains needed washing , and she even took them down one day , but they were so fine and rotten she knew they 'd never make it through the wringer , so she hung them back up the way they were . It really did n't occur to her to wax the wooden floors , and they looked dull and dirty as her children 's faces . Then Miss Pritchie died . <p> Her nephew came and told them about the place being sold off , but he was as decent as you could hope for , and he got Palmer a job at the lumber mill . Palmer went in drunk as much as he did sober , but all they ever did was dock his pay a little ; he never made it home with most of it anyway . <p> The day they left the farm was like a dream ; the details were clear to her , but they seemed to be happening to someone else . The rented house was much smaller , so Palmer sold half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . A dirty little man in a plaid shirt chewed tobacco while he went from room to room , occasionally narrowing his eyes at Selena , and spitting at the baseboard . When he put the Jackson press and her mother 's brass bed onto the back of his truck , she realized for the first time that they were her things , but that they were gone forever . The oblivious children ran in and out , laughing and yelling , climbing on the trucks and the furniture , skinning their knotty little knees and bleeding . Robert Wayne got a big scratch right under his nose and cried and snuffled all over it . <p> Selena , tired and rough-handed from shoving newspaper into boxes of dishes , wandered out to the orchard . The peacocks were there , moving from tree to fence to tree in some pattern known only to them , on business known only to each other . The two big males , trailing their tail feathers like quilts tied around their necks , were following a bare little peahen along the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance whenever she did . For a while after they molted , the cocks were nearly as homely as the hens ; lost-looking and sad , like they remembered their feathers . Granny used to laugh at them and say , " See , that 's what happens when you 're all flower and no fruit ! " <p> Selena could n't remember if they had molted yet this year , and wondered suddenly if she could have missed it . Almost in a panic , she opened the gate and began searching through the tall grass for peacock feathers . The thought of leaving one there seemed more horrible than seeing her furniture sold . It might be that no one would ever come back to get the peacock feathers again , and that was one thought she could n't bear . <p> When the loading was done and they began to drive down the lane for the last time , Palmer suddenly slammed the brakes and jumped out of the truck . He grabbed up rocks from the border of the empty flower beds and heaved them through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The children laughed at this , and clapped . Selena looked back over her shoulder as they drove away , and little wisps of the curtains were beginning to blow out of the bottom of the broken windows like tears in eyes already brimming . <p> The house they rented was near the lumber mill . You could smell a smell like sawdust burning on most days , and the thought of the sawdust swirling around inside the big building where Palmer went every morning made Selena hot and dizzy ; she would close the windows against it , but the children would bring the smell back in with them , banging the door and yelling . They did n't miss the farm at all . <p> Palmer made a few friends , men at the mill , and he would come home saying things like , " I was talking to one of the boys at the shop the other day , and he told me that that son-of-a-bitchin ' nephew of Miss Pritchie 's ai n't done nothing with that farm yet . " <p> Selena knew that Palmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm , that he had once owned it free and clear . <p> " Them goddamned crooked lawyers and that jackleg little nephew cheated me out of what was mine , " he would tell them , as they sat there at the kitchen table , and they would lean on their elbows and drink . After a while the visitors would wander on home , and Palmer would stumble to bed . He would wake up cheerful the next morning , and go to work singing . Now with Palmer gone all day , Selena could n't remember what it was she used to do at the farm . She got up every morning at the same time , and made breakfast , and somehow saw to it that all three of the children got out the door to school . Robert Wayne would yell for his socks ; Estelle would not be able to find her schoolbooks ; Claude would need a dollar for something . It all seemed so noisy and confusing , the way these children kept getting bigger and louder , and the way they always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tentative , uncertain way ; she looked at magazines that were a few months old . <p> What it was , she decided one day when the children left for school , was that she could n't get away from anybody . The little rented house was too crowded to keep clean , the children were making it shrink around her . She could almost feel the little house tightening over them like a scab , and she could still feel them all in it even when they were gone . <p> She began to understand that she hated her children , but it did n't seem to be an unnatural feeling , and no one noticed anything wrong . <p> So she began to drink . <p> It was bound to happen and she knew it . It was just one of those things that came upon you in life , like children , and it did no good to fight it . <p> She could n't sleep , was the problem , on account of the peacocks . She would think she heard them crying in the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to remember that there were no peacocks out here by the lumber mill , never had been any . She knew that what she was hearing in her sleep were all those other years , long ago , of peacock cries stored up in her head , and she would get up tired and anxious . So she thought about Palmer 's bottle , and decided it might help her sleep and keep her from hearing the peacocks . That was all she had intended from the beginning . To sleep . <p> So she drank , and though her children continued to startle her , it was the way you would be amazed by one of the freaks at the State Fair : distant , on a stage . They just came in from school , or from playing up and down the road with neighbor kids , and they left again in the mornings , bigger and louder than before . <p> " Mama , I want to go fishing with Larry , " Claude would say , and she would find herself looking at the broad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking to her . She was embarrassed by all these ugly children ; it was just another one of those things that her mother would never have let happen . <p> But before too long , Claude was gone altogether , off to war . Well , that had the sort of ring her mother could have understood . In her mother 's day , all sorts of people had gone off to war ; why , Selena 's own Granny had lost a son to it . Even nice people did that , so Selena liked Claude better , wrote him letters , cried over him being gone , drank especially for that . <p> That left just Estelle and Robert Wayne . Estelle was going on sixteen , a big girl , sweet and dumb and fertile as a cow . She lost that first baby , and never would say where it came from . Selena , for her part , did n't want to know , did n't want even to hear about it ; but Palmer raged , both drunk and sober , and threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept this bruised look about her after that , and slumped her shoulders even worse than before . She would n't go back to school , and Robert Wayne said it was because of what some of the boys said to her , but he did n't care ; he just snickered . <p> For a while , Selena had thought that Robert Wayne might be smarter than the others , might make something ; it turned out that he was just meaner . When Claude would get sent home from school it was because he was smoking , or sneaking out to the parking lot to look at somebody 's car engine , until finally he just quit going . But with Robert Wayne , it was always because he was fighting , getting blood on his shirt , his or someone else 's . When he got caught stealing cigarettes from the little market , he even tried to hit the policeman they called to come scare him . But Selena never caught him drinking , and was glad for that . It was her way of protecting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claude was already back from Vietnam . Claude was different now , and even Selena noticed it . He would disappear for days , say he had gotten a job , or an apartment , and then he would come home again , not talking . He had a camera with him in Vietnam , and he had taken pictures . He and Robert Wayne took to running around together like there was no age difference between them , and Selena worried that Claude was taking him where there was drinking . <p> It was Robert Wayne who would show the pictures of Vietnam to people they met at Rock Castle . Beer was cheap there , there was a pool table , and there was always somebody hanging around you could talk to . Robert Wayne would be the one to tell them about Vietnam ; Claude would sit there beside him grinning and nodding , the gap between his front teeth giving him a goofy , untouched look . The pictures were of dead people , mangled bodies that had lain in the heat too long . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Wayne would talk about what it was like , things Claude had seen , horrible , hot , unbelievable things . In the stale airlessness of the little beer joint , Robert Wayne could make the world seem rotten and smell bad while Claude sat there grinning . <p> There would be women in there , too ; he liked telling it to the women best . Sometimes they would refuse to look at the pictures and just walk away . Robert Wayne would follow them with his eyes , turning his whole broad face , and the look he gave them looked like hatred . <p> They said that was what started that last fight . One of them did that to him , just turned her back and walked away , and the swing of her hips and the way she held her cigarette between two fingers drove him into a rage . He jumped up and left Claude sitting there with his grin , and went after the girl . He grabbed her arm and swung her around , cursing , and tried to shove the pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't heard it all before , or that she was n't used to being grabbed and flung around : it just happened that she had a boyfriend that night , and the boyfriend had a cue stick in his hand when he got to Robert Wayne . <p> Claude watched while the ambulance carried Robert Wayne away . <p> Then he got up and picked his pictures up off the floor , wiped them on the leg of his pants , and went on home to tell Selena . <p> Months went by , and Selena got into a routine ; sometimes she would forget where Robert Wayne was and begin to worry , but mostly she knew , and she would spend her days at the hospital , where she would sit and talk to him . They said he could n't hear her , but she talked to him anyway . <p> The more she talked to him , the more she remembered that she needed to tell him . She told him about the farmhouse with the white curtains ; she told him about her Daddy and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snapping turtles . She would only stop talking long enough to slip into the bathroom for her little sip . She told him about the wide porches , and the wooden floors , and she told him about the peacocks . <p> She said to him one night , just before he finally died , " I know it 's hard to believe . I could n't believe it myself , how a silly bird could grow something so beautiful , and a whole mantle full at that . And then they would just fall off , just like they were done with them , and you could have them for the taking . " <p> But she forgot to tell him the rest , about the noise they made at night ; she had meant to tell him that the cries had sounded like women , but that she was n't afraid . She had meant to tell him all about that , but he died . <p> Everyone said what a blessing . <p> That night , after the funeral , Selena went home and went to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ham in the kitchen , another person brought an iced cake that sagged in the middle , but Selena just slept . Finally , someone came into her room to check on her , some well-meaning neighbor or other , and opened a window against the heat and stuffiness . It must have been that night air that brought in the dream ; it came in coolness and stealth . <p> She dreamed of the peacocks again , of course , dreamed that they had beautiful mantles of glistening feathers like eyes wet with tears , and they spun slowly in the colored shadows , silently . <p> Selena dreamed that she was there with them , in her white dress , with lemon-colored ribbons in her hair and at her waist , and they fanned out around her as she danced with the peacocks , the peacocks that cried in her sleep and never woke her . <p> <p> By SUSAN HILES <p>
