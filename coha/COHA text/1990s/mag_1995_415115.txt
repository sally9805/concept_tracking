Sandra Brownlee is a handweaver with an unswerving commitment to her medium . But not because of its potential for structural complication or its ability to seduce us through lush material qualities . For over 15 years she has quietly examined and listened to the textile and its potential to be rendered as abstract pictorial space . Although Brownlee , who was born in Fredericton , New Brunswick , was trained as a weaver at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax , it was at the Cranbrook Academy of Art that she first began to work in the way that now distinguishes her . There , in several series of modestly scaled black-and-white weavings , she made her first utterances in a language that has grown and evolved from 1981 , when she received her M.F.A. degree , to the present . ( Since 1987 Brownlee has lived in Philadelphia , where she is adjunct associate professor at the University of the Arts . ) Much of Brownlee 's time at Cranbrook was spent deciphering the textile , uncovering a rich vocabulary of marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed from the beginning that she was not weaving pictures of drawings but was allowing the picture to emerge from the weaving , and her approach has not changed . Her early Cranbrook pieces are a journal , Brownlee 's initial recording of the way in which single threads penetrate a woven ground and become delicate , tangible mark . Accumulated threads collect side by side , their ends defining the zigzag edge of a woven shape . She became obsessed with the textile , constructing and deconstructing basic geometries , beginning with squares , checkerboards , side-by-side repeating X 's , then progressing to other stair-step letter forms . She began with a universal geometry of the simple block , then connected and eventually distorted it . Some of the woven shapes stand isolated while others cluster to form a sparsely patterned checkerboard field , with groups of half-ladder , stair-step and fragmented T-bars on the ground . These early works show a dynamic mix of merging and overlapping white and black grounds , with thin stripes pushing in from the selvage edges and border frames of rhythmical patterned bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds , and the reverse , over many compositions , moving from a familiar geometry to an interconnected and sometimes quirky mix of forms . Weavings like 1234 Series #4 , 1980 , and Woodward Series #2 , 1980 , reveal important clues about the spirited and eccentric compositions yet to come . Among Brownlee 's best-known weavings , accomplished shortly after graduate school , were a group called the Unusual Animals Series , 1982-84 . Slightly larger than a foot square , these works all featured an animal-like figure contained within a square and surrounded by a larger field of eccentric patterning . Richly influenced by brocaded Indonesian ship cloths and the highly figurative tapestry fragments from preColumbian mantles , this series represents a significant next step in Brownlee 's development . Here for the first time we see a recognizable figure become the focus  --  a fantastic animal which appears to have been constructed from an odd but fascinating mixture of textile geometrics . It is not difficult to understand the evolution of these creatures after looking at Brownlee 's previous weavings and observing the way various abstract fragments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems natural that as the fragmented shapes were explored on the loom , they would grow legs , beaks , and exaggerated tail feathers . In Unusual Animals Series #1 , 1983 , a microscaled anteater , stork and horse metamorphose from a part of the erratic white pattern on black ground surrounding the central figure . And these often whimsical , sometimes bizarre animal and human incarnations appear in most of Brownlee 's weavings to the present , either as central figures in a composition or peripheral clues floating about the field . The use of animal imagery throughout the history of textiles is a rich and varied subject about which one could write volumes . Animals were significant in many cultures as mythological creatures or powerful symbols  --  the feline in pre-Columbian , the lion in Sassanian and fish in Coptic civilizations , for example  --  and there is incredible invention in the forms in which animals have been depicted in cloth . Brownlee arrived at her own imagery through unselfconscious play , and her use of animal figures in the Unusual Animals Series is much more a celebration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past than it is about claiming their meaning for her own . Of these ancient textiles Brownlee says , " Beyond their virtuosity , they are poignant and beautiful textile objects that convey , in a powerful and magical way , an authentic testament to what the individual maker knew and cared about . " Except for a brief foray into color in a 1986 solo exhibition focusing on floral images , Brownlee continued to work ( and still does ) in a diminutive scale , with black and white cotton sewing thread as both warp and weft . At around the same time , Brownlee collaborated with Warren Lehrer , a book artist , writer and performer , on an epic multicolor volume titled GRRRHHHH : a study of social patterns . Produced by the Center for Editions at the State University of New York , Purchase , this limited-edition book is described on its title page as a " 462 page extended visual fugue based on the long forgotten but pivotal animals of the earth , first discovered between the warp and weft on the hand loom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave over her woven images and worked with Lehrer on subjecting them to a riotous series of manipulations , juxtapositions , blowups and color changes through photo-mechanical and digital scanning processes . Apart from its critical success as a book arts document , GRRRHHHH was important to Brownlee for the way it stimulated greater improvisation in the weaving she undertook after the Unusual Animal Series . She was already moving toward more fragmented and abstract imagery , and the book further inclined her toward an open , fluid approach . The process Brownlee employs in making a " drawing " through the loom is amazing . She refers to this experience as something which allows a " stream of consciousness " to pass from the mind through the hands to the weaving . This approach is plausible only because Brownlee is so absolutely familiar with weaving techniques and with the loom . She is able to remove herself from concentration on the mechanical operation , thus allowing the image to be guided , even cajoled , by intuition in such a way that it seems to spread across and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Brownlee : at times she 's in control ; at others she 's on automatic pilot as the surface grows before her . It is important to understand that this is not like tapestry weaving , where each shape is isolated and woven individually . Rather , with Brownlee , a single thread spans the shed , and groups of threads appear to be a delicate sediment of three-dimensional lines stacking upon one another . The entire width of a composition fills as the weaving grows , with clusters of shapes , often twisted and convoluted , emerging simultaneously on the surface . Brownlee has the uncanny ability to make weavings that display freedom of gesture , seeming to defy their slow , intensive process . Her most recent work , including weavings from the Creation Series , has a subtle overall energy that causes both surface and image to come alive as never before . In the masterful Creation Series #4 , 1990 , it appears that each of the hundreds of ever-changing amorphous shapes is distanced from yet related to one another as if held in position by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swell and grow dark while others thin as an overall field of energy softly transforms the surface . What gives this work power is not only the graphic qualities of the " drawing " but the substance of the work as a weaving . Each shape is subtly " incised " in the cloth by the thin relief of black thread which brocades and sinks above and below the white fabric plane . Each shape has " bearing " to  --  is physically part of  --  the surface : this is a drawing , literally , of substance  --  a drawing which is also perceived as an object . Brownlee 's intimately scaled weavings draw us close to the surface and then hold us captive by their combined material and graphic power . The continuously changing amorphous shapes fade in and out of being recognizable subject matter . Those of Creation Series #4 , for example , seem constantly to be mutating and reinventing themselves . Several of the radically inflated shapes resemble fragments deconstructed from the animalia of Brownlee 's earlier work . Her recent weavings exude a greater sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further into the unknown . Sea , 1994 , contains highly animated abstract shapes in white floating in a sea of black . Sometimes convoluted and meandering , they come apparently from the same genre-possible prehistoric marine life . By being less literal , Brownlee allows us to discover and interpret an abundance of related forms : squid , undulating plants , pelicans , eels , etc . On the other hand , where the black ground of the sea opens in the lower portion of the work , we look through to a galaxy of distant constellations . Peppered specks of white light peer through the brocaded black threads . The forms are evocative and shifting ; grounds of black on white and white on black relocate our imagination , permitting us to experience the work in a variety of contexts . The reversing of figure and ground is inherent in constructing a textile plane , and Brownlee has proven to be a master of this phenomenon . Her drawings in thread each allude to a woven yantra , an intimate but powerful diagram that allows us to journey through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each abstract picture is a small , potent object that exudes energy , yet also seems to contain and support life as it reinforces the spirit of those who see it . The meaning in Brownlee 's work is not contained in a particular message or story ; rather it is a form that induces an attitude of contemplation in the viewer . We are first drawn to her work through the corporeal , the sensuous , then are prompted to go further . We are not bound by imagery that teaches or preaches but are enabled to intuit other realities which may extend into the subconscious . The real subject : of these weavings is the imaginative power and volition of Sandra Brownlee .
