This morning I removed a bloodthirsty bat clinging to the curtain in the family room and saved my wife and daughter from an eternity of undeath . And this evening I am making risotto , which my wife loves and says is superior to any found in restaurants , the Van Gogh Sunflowers of risotto . This is the life of a man who knows grandeur . I simmer the chopped onions and fennel in a pool of butter and shave Parmesan into a bowl while my clients sit on the front steps , enjoying the last of summer in St. Paul , watching people stroll past , waiting for a dog . <P> My daughter is 19 months old and is thrilled to the tips of her toes by dogs , any dog , but particularly the neighbors ' golden Lab , Tula . She toddles toward her and reaches out to touch , jabbering endearments , trembling for joy . What you or I would feel if an angel appeared , my daughter feels upon meeting a dog . <P> She is the one in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are told in poems to do  --  to gather rosebuds while we may and treasure the hour of splendor in the grass and prove the pleasures that this brief summer yields . Hers is the age of sheer delight , and among her dog pals and wading pools and her books and my risotto , she is gathering rosebuds left and right . <P> I do n't say that mine is all that great a risotto , but of all the bat catchers in St. Paul , I probably make as good a risotto as any of them . The secret , besides lavish administration of butter and cheese , is to rush the rice toward the finish line at high speed and then turn off the heat and coast across . My little girl thinks my risotto is more than good enough , but she is glad for everything we set before her . The chapter in the child manual on finicky eaters does not apply to her : she licks her chops the moment the bib is tied ; she digs into her risotto with profound gusto , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her right . <P> Her delight delights me , and I am down with the summertime blues . Winter lifts me up , and summer drags me down , and always has . A good thunderstorm helps , but then the sun comes out . I used to enjoy playing golf in the summer , but golf is a game that brings out the worst in people , and fishing is a very poor use of time , and basketball is perilous for the older guy . He fights for a rebound and snaps an Achilles tendon and spends six months in a walking cast  --  I would n't even want to be in the cast of The King and I for six months . Risotto is the sport for me . It 's easy , it takes an hour , you get a feeling of accomplishment ; then you get to sit down and eat . <P> Last night my daughter woke up at 4 a.m. in high spirits and yelled at us until we took her downstairs to the kitchen . She dug into her toy basket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whack it , a perverse invention indeed . My daughter walked the floor with this doll , as if trying to put it to sleep , and my wife and I sat like a couple of refugees and thought blank thoughts and longed for our bed . And then my wife went upstairs and discovered the bat .
