Jim Harbaugh walked out of the trainer 's room after his Indianapolis Colts had been beaten by the New England Patriots , 27-9 , and you checked his features to see just how much damage had been done . Nasty bruise under the right eye , another one on the bridge of his nose , which was slightly off center , having been broken by the Patriots with 7:29 left in the fourth quarter . // " His nose was pushed way over to one side , " Colts center Kirk Lowdermilk said . " I guess they pushed it back somehow . " // Harbaugh made his farewell from the RCA Dome playing field after the injury , heading back to the locker room , a towel pressed to his nose , as reserve quarterback Paul Justin ran the Colts ' offense . There would be no comeback for Captain Comeback this Sunday , only a long week ahead , doing interviews that would begin , " How much more of this can you take ? " // The week before , after the Baltimore Ravens nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numb at one point in the game , he had spent Sunday night in the hospital  --  for general rehab . The game before that , he had limped off the field after the Bills sacked him six times . " Wrist , turf toe , tendinitis in the ankle , bruised heel , " Harbaugh said two days before the Pats broke his nose . " The wrist was the one that scared me . I was surprised it was n't broken ; I thought it was when I took the hit . I 've had some pretty memorable beatings. " // He has been sacked 14 times in the last three games . Buffalo 's six on Oct. 6 are understandable because the Bills are major-league sackers . But the Ravens came into the RCA Dome with six sacks on the season , and they picked up three in the first quarter . They ended up with four for the day , and that left New England as the NFL 's worst sacking team , with nine in six games . The Pats got four on Sunday . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest , which saw the Colts run off 44 first-half plays , to New England 's 22 , and still trail the Patriots 10-6 on the scoreboard . Fumbles , drops and special teams breakdowns were the Colts ' undoing . But when a fumbled punt gave the Patriots a gift touchdown to open the second half and Harbaugh was forced to play catch-up , New England 's pressure kicked in , and there was plenty of it . // " There were times when they did n't know where we were coming from , " said Patriots defensive end Willie McGinest , who had two sacks plus the knockout blow that broke Harbaugh 's nose . // " The first guy end Mike Jones yanked my face mask , " Harbaugh said after the game . " The second guy McGinest cleaned me up with a right cross . " // " We knew coming in that they had protection problems , " said rush linebacker Chris Slade , who applied constant pressure all afternoon . " Their Buffalo game was a massacre . " // Well , the Colts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at 5-2 , a game ahead of the Patriots and the Dolphins , but their quarterback is getting slaughtered , and if you 're Indianapolis coach Lindy Infante , what do you do ? // The options are threefold : 1 ) Open a new can of linemen , 2 ) tailor the offense to a shorter drop ( few teams use as many seven-step-drop pass plays as the Colts do ) , or 3 ) get Harbaugh to respect the pocket more , to stay at home instead of throwing so much on the move . // Option number 1 is not possible in midseason . Number 2 is not practical , Infante says , because he 's a seven-step-drop man and you ca n't change your whole philosophy . " It compounds the problem , " he says . " All a shorter drop does is get your quarterback ready to throw quicker , but if your pattern has n't developed , where are you ? " // And number 3 ? Well , it 's tough to respect the pocket when it keeps breaking down , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of Harbaugh 's particular style . He 's more effective when he 's on the move . He does n't fumble , and he does n't throw interceptions  --  the usual liabilities of moving quarterbacks  --  and he does n't hang around long enough to get whacked from the blind side . // " You 'll notice that when I get hit , it 's usually when I 'm on the move , " he said last Friday . " I respect guys like Bledsoe or Marino who stand there till the last second trying to make a big play , but I do n't think I have the arm for that . And you do n't see Brett Favre standing there getting rocked . He likes to move too . " // O.K. , so you get hit and you do n't cough up the football . Award that man a medal  --  but it 'll have to be the Purple Heart . // " I do n't think about injuries on the field , " Harbaugh said . " But afterward when I 'm looking at films , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " // O.K. , how many can you take ? // " Look , " he said , " I 'm not gon na change my style just to survive a season . You 're born , you play , you coach , you die . "
