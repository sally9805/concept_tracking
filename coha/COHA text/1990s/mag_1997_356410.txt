TIME 's China watchers had been planning a special report on the legacy of Deng Xiaoping for months , but it was n't until 10 p.m . Wednesday  --  early morning in the U.S.  --  that Beijing bureau chief Jaime FlorCruz got a tip that China 's ailing leader might be dead . As FlorCruz raced to the TIME bureau , driving past Tiananmen Square and the residences of the top Communist Party officials , he could tell something was amiss ; police at each intersection were waving motorists to the side so that black cars with flashing red lights could enter Zhongnanhai , the party headquarters . Within hours , Deng 's death had been confirmed , and deputy managing editor Jim Kelly had given the go-ahead for this week 's cover package . <P> TIME has long had a special relationship with Deng  --  or , as we used to spell it , Teng . He was twice named Man of the Year  --  a distinction shared by a select group of world leaders that includes Churchill , Eisenhower and Gorbachev . When Deng decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first interview with a Western magazine . <P> Deng might have seemed an unlikely choice as Man of the Year for 1978 . He had only recently been " rehabilitated " in one of the frequent purges of Mao 's later years . But we recognized even then that as the chief architect of the so-called Four Modernizations , Deng was destined to play a key role in helping propel China into the modern world . A few weeks later , we were rewarded for our prescience with that first exclusive interview  --  a 30-minute audience that stretched into 80 minutes and formed the basis of another Deng cover story . <P> By the time Deng won his second Man of the Year nomination , in 1985 , the effect of his " Great Leap Outward " was apparent to everyone . Deng had transformed the world 's most populous nation into something like a capitalist country  --  albeit one still run with a heavy , communist-style hand . That cover story too followed an exclusive interview ; this one included not only TIME journalists but also a group of U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a TIME Newstour of Asia . <P> " In Chinese culture , the Emperor is Emperor until he dies , and the new leaders ca n't do anything until he 's left the scene , " says TIME News Service director Richard Hornik , a former Beijing bureau chief , who coordinated our reporting effort . " So China has been stuck in neutral for the past few years . " Last week the country shifted back into gear .
