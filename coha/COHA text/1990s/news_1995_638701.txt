<p> During her congressional testimony at a field hearing in Cedar City , Utah , Terry Tempest Williams glanced up from her manuscript and saw that her congressman was bored . <p> He was leafing through papers , paying no attention as she pleaded against his bill , which would open a proposed wilderness area to oil and gas lines , mines , dams , motor vehicles , roads and other development . <p> She stopped speaking and looked up at Rep. Jim Hansen , R-Utah , who perched on a riser 10 feet away . Hansen noticed the silence and glanced down . <p> " Chairman Hansen , " Williams said , " I have lived in Utah all my life . I am a woman who has devoted her life to language and landscape . I have never felt so inadequate as a writer . Is there anything I can say to you that would open your mind or your heart to consider an alternative view to the wilderness bill before us ? " <p> Hansen leaned forward , over the papers he 'd been reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his half-glasses . <p> " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Williams , " he said . " There is something about your voice I can not hear . " <p> Williams stared at him . His words struck her as chilling , unintentionally poetic . <p> " It was shocking , " she said later , thinking back on that day last summer . " It was at that moment I realized what we were up against . " <p> " The Joshua trees standing their ground had been named by my ancestors , who believed they looked like prophets pointing west to the Promised Land . These were the same trees that bloomed each spring , flowers appearing like white flames in the Mojave . And I recalled a full moon in May , when Mother and I had walked among them , flushing out mourning doves and owls . " - " Refuge , " 1991 <p> Hansen 's comment would puzzle the people who crowd rooms to hear Terry Tempest Williams read from her books , or talk about the Western lands she has known all her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rachel Carson . Other writers say her style has no precedent . Her unique voice combines precise , concrete images with a passion rare to natural history essays . <p> Her friend Richard Nelson , author of " The Island Within , " explains her appeal : " She 's expanding what nature writing is all about , partly by her extraordinary skill with the English language , and her knowledge of the natural world , but also because of her unique perspective as a Mormon woman deeply rooted in the desert country of Utah . She has a way of blending her personal life and her family life and her Mormon traditions into her writing . She 's one of the very best writers in evoking that connection between a person and her homeland . " <p> This has made her something of a cult figure " and a role model , " says writer Stephen Trimble , " for young women who want to write about nature . " When Williams , age 40 , appears for a reading or lecture , many bookstore managers hand out numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more to speak with Williams as she signs their copies of " Refuge , " " An Unspoken Hunger " " Pieces of White Shell " and other books . <p> So many people showed up for a Salt Lake City signing for " An Unspoken Hunger " that one man had time to read his copy , start to finish , as the line inched its way toward her . At Seattle 's Elliot Bay Book Co. , 230 readers jammed two rooms and a staircase when Williams read from her new book , " Desert Quartet . " The last one did n't leave until store employees started locking up at 11:30 p.m . <p> " We stayed late , but I did n't mind because Terry is so terrific , " says Diane Sepanski , who hosted the reading . <p> " Not many authors draw that kind of crowd . Barry Lopez . Russell Means . David Byrne did n't get that many . Her devotion to the audience was just incredible . I 've hardly seen any author give that kind of attention to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was at the Seattle reading , put it another way . <p> " It 's amazing , " he said , " to sit at that desk with her and listen . Sometimes she 'll stay till midnight , sitting and talking to each person . <p> Most of the people who wait for Williams are sympathetic , but lately that is changing . At a reading near Prescott , Ariz. , one man leapt to his feet . He began screaming at her . <p> " People like you , " he shouted , " want to do away with missiles ! You blaspheme Christianity ! You want to ruin the family ! You feminists want to wreck the lives of hard-working men ! You love animals and trees more than you like people ! You 're anti-human ! " <p> When he paused for breath , Williams spoke . <p> " I am afraid , " she said to the man , and to the rest of the silent audience . " For the first time in my life , I fear that we are losing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man approached Williams . He was calm then . She thanked him for coming to the reading , and told him that many members of her family " would find a kinship " with his views . He said that he 'd driven three hours to see her , and that he 'd come specifically to hand her a gift . Then he presented her with a heavy cardboard box . <p> When Williams returned to her home in Emigration Canyon , outside Salt Lake City , she opened the box . Inside was a thick manuscript . It was a meticulous parody of her 304-page book " Refuge , " which is partly a chronicle of her mother 's lingering death from ovarian cancer . <p> " His satire was written from a Christian , Wise Use point of view , " Williams said , " showing the evil nature of this work . It was so cruel , and so mean-spirited . " <p> She kept the manuscript for three days . In the quiet house where she lives with Brooke Williams , her husband of 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sense of home as refuge . Finally , she threw it away . <p> " I 've always been aware of an opposition to my work . All my life , I 've resisted acknowledging the deep schisms in this country that create a philosophical divide between us . I realized , then , that now you are not seen for what you are , but for what you represent . " <p> " Am I an activist or an artist ? Do I stay home or do I speak out ? " <p> - " The Wild Card " in " An Unspoken Hunger , " 1994 <p> Williams represents many things . Not everyone agrees on what she represents . <p> She considers herself a Mormon , and still belongs to the home stake - the congregation - in which she grew up . But the elders of the Mormon church repeatedly warn and caution her for failing to heel more closely to their idea of a Mormon woman - compliant , obedient and visibly fertile . <p> The Mormon journal " Dialogue , " in a scathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electing to have no children . The Deseret News ' review of " Desert Quartet " compared her to Walt Whitman , St. Theresa and St. John of the Cross - a comparison that " in their minds , is not positive , " Williams said . <p> " My relationship to the church defies a stereotype . It causes me great sadness in many ways . Outside the state , I 'm viewed as a Mormon . Within my own state , particularly in my own community , it 's - it 's not been an easy path . I still maintain my ties to the culture and the church . I love the culture , I love the people , I love the place , and I ca n't separate them . " <p> She is painstakingly courteous and relentlessly optimistic . But when Sen. Robert Bennett , R-Utah , former bishop of Williams ' home stake and her Emigration Canyon neighbor , said he could n't tell the difference between cow pies and " elk pies , " to make the point that cattle grazing is environment-friendly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bullet-shaped elk droppings , which she gift-wrapped and mailed to Bennett along with a field guide . <p> She is devoted to her family , the Tempests of the four-generation Tempest Construction Co. , a pipe contracting company whose politics and work often are at loggerheads with the environmental causes she defends , editorially and politically . <p> Williams was 18 before she met a Democrat ; Bill Clinton was elected without the help of most Tempests . Williams is friendly with Clinton 's wife . Hillary Rodham Clinton initiated their relationship with a fan letter about " Refuge " and invited Williams to Jackson Hole during the Clintons ' vacation there last summer . She had Williams to tea at the White House . <p> " Terry votes for those liberal candidates , " says her father , " but that does n't cloud our relationship , like some people think it does . " <p> Not that there are n't storms . A few years ago , there was a memorable tempest at Thanksgiving dinner , when Williams ' uncle , Richard Tempest , a former Utah Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract to lay fiber-optic cable was stalled outside St. George because the blueprint called for the line to run 7 miles through protected habitat for the desert tortoise . <p> Richard Tempest accused the family liberals , who include Williams and her husband , of " liking turtles better than you like people . " Williams , who was trained as a naturalist in her undergraduate and graduate work at the University of Utah , immediately corrected him . <p> " Desert tortoises , not turtles , " she said . It was like throwing kerosene on a fire . <p> Eventually , her paternal grandfather , Jack , stopped the argument . This is n't about habitat , or contracts , or environmentalists , he announced . <p> " Tell them the story , " he said to his sons . " Tell them about Deadpan . " <p> Deadpan was a desert tortoise that the boys shared as a childhood pet . They had yearned for a puppy . They made do by drilling a hole in Deadpan 's thick shell and looping a string through it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " She claims that 's why we were anti-tortoise , " John Henry Tempest says . <p> " Well , we were held up on that project in St. George for a year , waiting for the government to give us a go-ahead . There 's what you call some pretty liberal people in our family , talking about protecting the environment . They do n't realize the family living comes from construction . " <p> Actually , Williams says , that fact rarely is far from her thoughts . At one of the regional hearings about the Utah wilderness bill , her heart paused when her father stood up , in his worn Levis and cowboy boots , to speak his piece . <p> " I told them , ' I am a contractor , you know , and for four generations , we 've made our living off growth and development in Utah , " ' Tempest recalled . <p> " I 'm 63 . I 've hiked , or run gas or telephone lines , in nearly every canyon here . There 's very few places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen these cities like St. George trash themselves , building houses right on the ridge line . I 've seen more changes in the last 3 to 5 years , with people pouring into the West , coming from Phoenix or L.A. , because they perceive this as a simpler life and crime-free . What 's funny , they bring their problems with them . <p> " I said , ' Even though we make our money off development , what makes life worth living is a day like that . ' Point being , I said , that as a developer , I felt development ought to be limited . You ca n't stop growth , but you can manage it so it does n't wreck everything for everyone . <p> " And I told about being on a hike a little earlier that week , on one of the wilderness areas in question . Notch Peak . I went there and hiked . Climbed the peak . I did n't see another human being all day . It was a fantastic deal . <p> " A day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put a price on it . <p> When he finished , hundreds of people were applauding . <p> " The bill is not a wilderness measure , as its proponents describe it , but a federal zoning act . " <p> " Open for Business ? " - The New York Times , 1995 <p> The Utah Public Lands Management Act is colloquially known as the Utah wilderness bill . That is something of a misnomer , in terms of adhering to the 1964 Wilderness Act , which says , " A wilderness is in contrast to those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape . " <p> The Utah bill is more like a zoning act that affects 22 million acres of Utah land controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management . Barring delays , Congress will vote on the bill next month . The bill designates 1.8 million acres of that land as protected wilderness . In addition to permitting existing mines , roads and other development to be grandfathered in , it provides for the construction of new dams , roads , pipelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of off-road vehicles , Jet Skis and power boats . <p> The remaining 20 million acres , mostly on roadless land , would be open for mining , timbering , dam and road construction , and other development . The bill 's " hard-release " language bars 18 million acres of that land from future wilderness designation . <p> The 1.8 million acres of proposed wilderness is broken into 49 areas , islands of land mostly in central and southern Utah . Some of those islands border national parks , monuments or recreation areas . Other pieces are surrounded by land designated in 1976 as wilderness study areas , but opened to development as the BLM was pressured by power plant developers , ranchers , uranium mining interests , oil companies and others . <p> The bill 's sponsors , Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch and Rep. Jim Hansen , like to call it " a Madisonian compromise , " a phrase they coined . <p> Robert Dibblee , administrative assistant to Hatch , says , " I 'll be honest with you : It seemed like people would associate Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think what it means is , you debate issues , discuss the issues , and then begin reconciling them to come up with a compromise . <p> Each side quotes polls that claim the majority of Utah residents support them , but locals are divided about the bill . Generally speaking , county commissioners and business interests support it . Nearly 70 percent of the people who responded to Utah Gov . Michael Leavitt 's invitation for public comment said they were against it . <p> Some oppose the bill , but for different reasons than you might think . Unlike the environmentalists , they do n't want more wilderness acreage : They do n't want any . <p> However , wilderness opponents like the bill 's " hard-release " provision that says no more Utah land could be declared wilderness , and the promise that the new " wilderness " may be no more than a wink-and-a-nod label . <p> The same provisions appall Williams and other environmentalists throughout the United States . In their view , the Utah Public Lands Management Act makes wilderness indistinguishable from nonwilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million acres of wilderness , unencumbered by pro-development provisions . <p> " Our lack of intimacy with each other is in direct proportion to our lack of intimacy with the land . We have taken our love inside and abandoned the wild . " <p> " An Unspoken Hunger , " 1994 <p> Like the rest of the West , the Utah land that Williams knows intimately is changing . The isolated house where she grew up , only 8 miles from her present home , now is surrounded by new houses . Utah 's population is booming , thanks to a 30 percent birth rate and a surge of people moving in from out of state . <p> " Population growth is our biggest problem : Where are we going to put all these people ? And how are we going to put them to work ? " says Brooke Williams . <p> His questions articulate the dilemma the wilderness-bill proponents use to justify the development provisions , and that opponents say makes undeveloped land so precious . <p> " We recognize the environmental problems of a Parunuweap Canyon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed preliminary investigations for a dam on the Canyon , which is adjacent to Zion National Park in Utah 's booming Kane County . <p> " We do n't want to develop our water rights on the Virgin River - but at the same time , " he said , " we 'd go contrary to our obligation if we said , ' Go ahead and do n't protect the water right . " ' <p> Besides , Dibblee says , the environmentalists are over-dramatizing the beauty of the land they want to save , such as Hell Roaring Canyon , Scorpion , Dirty Devil , and Burning Hills . <p> " When it came to divvying out the land , the Park Service got the jewels , the Forest Service got the pretty stuff , and the BLM got the crap , " he says . <p> Such logic leaves Williams almost speechless . During a hike in a side canyon near the San Rafael Swell 's Muddy Creek , one of the areas excluded from the Utah wilderness bill , she stopped to stroke a flank of the slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth saving , " she said , gazing at the narrow walls curving overhead like enormous sandstone hips and shoulders . <p> " But if we lose places like Muddy Creek Canyon , then we shatter the serenity that is inherent in the canyons and in ourselves . <p> She sounded puzzled , not bitter . Her friend , Sandy Lopez , characterizes her as replete with " not so much optimism as hope . " <p> Williams says : " I refuse to be cynical . On this issue in particular . These are the things I love . This is home . This is family . This is what the opposition would want from us : that we could be cynical and complacent . " <p> She remembered a conversation with Ted Strong , director of the Columbia River Intertribal Fisheries Commission . Looking at a nearly barren river that once teemed with salmon , she asked him how he continued to be hopeful when only 400 salmon had been available for the tribes for ceremonial purposes that year . <p> Strong looked at her . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
