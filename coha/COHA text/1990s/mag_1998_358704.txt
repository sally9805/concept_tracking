Usually when we speak about journalists displaying courage , we mean they have the courage to pursue difficult stories that offend powerful people , or the courage to write a story that cuts against the conventional wisdom . KARSTEN PRAGER , our colleague here at TIME , had that sort of courage in abundance . But throughout his life , which ended when he lost a fight with lymphoma a few weeks ago , he showed a deeper , personal bravery that made him someone very special indeed . As a German boy of eight , he and his mother and siblings made a perilous escape west out of occupied Czechoslovakia to avoid being trapped under the coming Russian terror . And in his first job with TIME , in 1965 , he was one of our most fearless war correspondents in Vietnam . He repeated that role in the vicious war in Lebanon in 1975 . He then held postings around the world and became the managing editor of TIME 's international editions , building a fledgling into what is today a thriving global presence for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him and equally tough on the people he worked for , expecting his own high standards to be applied below and above him . He did this all with a twinkle in his eye and a gruffness that was n't even skin deep . Along the way , his heart failed him , several times , but he continued jetting around the world to get more stories and interview leaders ranging from the awful  --  Saddam Hussein  --  to the awesome  --  Nelson Mandela  --  to the truly historic  --  Mikhail Gorbachev . In 1987 , hours before he probably would have died , he received a heart transplant . He bravely endured near fatal attempts by his body to reject the new heart and came back to work and to more adventures . When he fell ill late last year , the doctors did n't think he would make it past Christmas . But in March , when TIME celebrated its 75th birthday , Karsten Prager , resplendent in his tuxedo , was among the partygoers . He never gave up , right up to the very end when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person with courage equal to Karsten 's . Several hundred people gathered in New York City last week to remember him . That was painful , but also joyous , because we were lucky to have known Karsten Prager . <P>  --  John F. Stacks
