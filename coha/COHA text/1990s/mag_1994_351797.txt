White House correspondent James Carney likes to say his current beat could n't be more different from his previous assignment , which was chronicling the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of Russia and the other independent states . " There the story was as vast as the land mass , " Carney notes . " Here the setting is much more intimate , with the focus on the small and overcrowded West Wing of the White House .

" I once thought Jay might be ' too nice ' to cover the White House , " admits Goodgame . " But that concern was dispelled for good when I listened to the tape of one of his interviews for a story on Whitewater . I heard a top Clinton aide trying to intimidate Jay by yelling at him , and I heard Jay , without losing his cool , raising his voice right back and demanding that his questions get answered  --  which they were .
