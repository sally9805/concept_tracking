Alex turned the key but the door would not budge . His wife had locked the door from the inside . He could hear the patter of her bare soles on the peacock-and-flower tile floor . He looked about the garden . It needed tending . Dried leaves liffered the ground and dead branches hung low from the stunted fig tree . For a Russian immigrant , he lived the Jerusalem dream : private villa and garden surrounded by civil German Jews . <p> Alex waited for Natasha to let him in . He yanked aside the creepers that covered the street number of his snug , pink-stone Arab house , then washed his hands in the mouth of the lion fountain . <p> Natasha opened the door and nodded to him . She continued her conversation on the portable phone . Alex whisked by her and headed to the shower . His wife never liked the smell of his sweat . <p> The solar-heated water was hot , cheap , and an ardent masseuse . Tonight was his fortieth birthday and a lot of people were coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the sailor who left his wife on a distant shore . <p> Alex stepped out of the shower and , naked and content , headed to get a cold beer . Natasha was busy in the kitchen kneading teftele  --  balls of meat , rice , and onion  --  that she would later deep-fry in oil . She frowned on nudity and he disliked her greasy teftele . Somehow they managed to stay together . <p> She waved her sticky hands in his direction . " The graphic artist just delivered the cover of my new book . " <p> Alex said , " Great . Where is it ? " <p> " In the bedroom . " <p> Alex took his beer and headed to the bedroom . The usual clutter in the room had been cleaned up and the cover of her new book lay on the dresser . The word " Out " lay across the nude body of an angel standing on his head . Alex 's medical eye took note the angel was not circumcised . He rested his wet bottom on the queen-sized bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered for him . It was to be less of a birthday party for him than for her new book . <p> Alex nursed his bottle . His wife wrote fiction and he wrote facts . He wrote about the doctor who cleaned dove droppings off the Western Wall ; about the engineer who claimed he was the Messiah . In her novels , Natasha imagined the doctor jumping off the Wall , the Messiah dying a natural death . Her books sold ; his articles did n't . Her activities procured for them goose-liver lunches in Turkey , kidney-pie suppers in London , and tenderloin breakfasts in New York . He had little reason to complain . <p> Alex got off the bed . He went into the kitchen , dipped his fingers into the bowl of fried meatballs and popped one into his mouth . " Excellent , really . " Natasha put down her spatula and pulled the bowl out of his reach . <p> " There wo n't be enough for my guests . " <p> " Have n't had a bite all day . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " <p> Alex went to the refrigerator and took out another beer . <p> " Do me a favor and do n't start guzzling in the afternoon . Stay sober , if you can . By the way , Mutti just called . I invited him to come over tonight . " <p> " Finally , I 'll get to meet him . " Alex used his teeth to pry the cap off the bottle and drank deeply . Mutti Aloni paid for all of it , the car , the rent , the vacations . Natasha had met Mutti at last fall 's Chagall exhibition at the National Museum and Mutti had started to sponsor her writing projects . <p> Alex had read her Out manuscript , and was sure it was a factual description of her affair with Mutti . However , he did not challenge her . It would have been declasse for him to do so ; for truth posing as fiction is , for an intellectual like himself , to be treated only as fiction . He believed that Natasha knew that he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day , though , he would have to tend to the undergrowths of their marriage . <p> Natasha 's current affair put little strain on the frayed ropes of their marriage ; she was home every night to drink vodka and watch a video with him . It would bother him a lot if Natasha carried on with a younger , more handsome man  --  but Mutti , as much as he could tell from the photograph , was a soft-bodied man in his fifties whose bald pate , liquid eyes , thin lips , and ashen grey complexion made him look more like an extra for Schindler 's List than the ruthless construction tycoon he was . <p> Natasha had been unfaithful in Russia , too , and bragged about it in her novels . Their friends there had known about her lovers for years ; it had long ceased to be a topic of conversation for them , a source of embarrassment for him . But in Moscow , he got nothing out of it . Worse , he often came home to find that her lovers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now he lived among capitalists  --  Mutti screwed his wife and Mutti had to pay . Because of this new twist of the lover paying the bills , the gossip resurrected itself  --  and Alex had to be more self-conscious as he juggled the balloon of honor and the hardball of survival . <p> He dressed and went into the kitchen . He looked at his wife . What sort of person read her meandering , overwrought , autobiographical novels ? She looked back at him . Her large smoky eyes seemed to be marveling that he was the father of her two children . Most of all , he was the handy bookmark trailing the chapters of her life . He could see her mind editing the last paragraph she had written about her infidelities . Every time she looked at his large frame , at his freckled hands stuck in his frayed pockets  --  she could grab the next thread in her novel . He was her corkboard  --  pins sticking into scraps of paper did not hold her ideas as well as the pained look and crumpled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his failures , his incompetence , his passivity , his lack of anger that drove her to a frenzy of action  --  to write about the writhing of her body and soul . Let him go away and , in the arms of her lovers , she would shrivel like falafel in hot oil . <p> " I 'm going out , " he said to Natasha 's back , framed by the window , shaded soft pastel red by the dust-filtered light . <p> Natasha tucked in the turquoise wings of the iron shutters . " Do n't be late , as usual . That 's why I bought you a watch . And while you 're out , why do n't you gather the leaves in front , like you said you would . " <p> " The dead leaves ? " <p> " No , the ones still on the tree . " <p> Alex went out of his house , looked down at the fallen leaves , walked past the red Audi in his driveway and headed up the block to the corner falafel stand . Falafel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the best was to be had . " Tsion 's Falafel " was not one of them , but it would do in a pinch . <p> It irked him that , too often , he settled for less . Perhaps birthday means , if not a new birth , a wee metamorphosis . Some day , he 'd pop out from under the leaves and spread his wings . Today , he 'd eat his falafel , gather some dead leaves  --  and let a respectable lawn welcome his guests . Why give Natasha the chance to tell everyone she did it all , that he did nothing ? <p> Alex looked down on Tsion 's oriental face , shimmering in the well of bubbling oil . Intent on rescuing a drowning , wrinkled ball , Tsion seemed oblivious to the popping sounds his sweat drops made greeting the hot oil underneath . Alex stood back from the tiny explosions and waited . He looked at the dial of his gold Rolex watch . Its two hands hung down in an inverted victory sign : twenty minutes to four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slowly rotate a long-handled wire spatula in the aluminum pot and , under a late afternoon August sun , let his customer 's fair face ripen to pomegranate red . <p> Three years was time enough for Alex to swallow and regurgitate local norms . In Jerusalem , where a customer was little less suspect than an infidel desiring to violate local goods , a supplicant-customer had to beg to gain entrance to any gate of commerce . It therefore did n't upset Alex that three minutes had passed  --  and Tsion gave no sign of his readiness to serve . <p> The Rolex ticked off another minute . Hoping to make Tsion acknowledge him , Alex poured out a deep bass rendition of the " Volga Boatman . " The stirring melody did not move Tsion , though . He hummed an Arabic tune and continued with his rescue mission . <p> Alex folded his hairy arms across his boxer 's chest . When Tsion did decide to take notice of him , he 'd have to break his teeth to say in Hebrew , " No burnt balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauce . " Last time he ordered falafel , he had n't said that , and ten minutes later had to dash to the head in a riotous bout of diarrhea . He was n't going to let Tsion cheat him this time . He 'd make sure the Moroccan stuffed five ( and not four ) falafel balls in his pita ; he 'd refuse to accept even one shriveled ball . Alex was feeling good about his resolve when Tsion looked up . <p> Stern-faced , Tsion held the ball in his thick fingers and offered it to Alex . " On the house . " <p> Surprised by Tsion 's generosity , Alex took the gift , blew on it to cool it off and said , " My first birthday gift . " <p> He gingerly popped the whole , shriveled , brown ball into his mouth . The texture was gritty but supple , the taste sweet but not cloying . <p> Alex felt a light blow in the base of his spine . He swallowed hard  --  some chickpea paste clogged his windpipe  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his mouth right back into Tsion 's court , plonking down into its own hot womb . " Satan " Alex cursed in Russian . Tsion raised the greasy spatula and swatted him full across the face . <p> Alex retreated from the stand . He knew who was responsible for this fiasco . Boris . A finger-jab in the back was Boris 's way of greeting old friends  --  of making new enemies . Alex turned about to confront the pinched face of Boris , a fellow immigrant , whose hopes had also wilted under the tattered awnings of the Mideast bazaar . <p> " How are you ? " Boris asked , in his ever-so-quiet , enraging voice . <p> Alex arced his arm as if he had to flit a fly out of his eyes and walked away . There was no point in trying to right the wrong , to apologize to Tsion , to blame Boris . It was foolhardy to try to cool the heat of Tsion 's fury ; to console a man when his dead still lay at his feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gut and he had to forego venting his anger  --  even one dash of it  --  against Boris . He had to keep his chin up , his bile down . He had to ignore Tsion 's curses  --  clear above the clatter of loose-sandaled feet and the gearshift groans of speeding , braking cars : " Bolshevik Your mother was a commie whore and ... and your daughter can jump on my pole . " <p> Boris stepped right in front of Alex . A coy smile played on his rubbery lips . " And your wife , how is she ? " <p> Alex avoided Boris 's dark eyes and fixed instead on a passing Ethiopian teenager in cork-heeled platform shoes ; she was dressed in a short red cotton halter too tight for her ample breasts . Alex noticed that a bad job had been done on her exposed navel . <p> The Israeli doctors refused to give him a license . He had delivered more than three thousand babies in Russia and he had tied every umbilical cord properly , even artistically . <p> " We want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical board had said . Alex did n't bother telling them that , together with his father , he had been delivering calves and ewes since he was six . Here , in his tribal homeland , they would n't let him touch a newborn baby . <p> Alex softly said to Boris , " Natasha is O.K. She 's back from St. Petersburg . " <p> " Talking up romantic porn , is she ? " <p> " That and some other books . " <p> " Hey , you want to hear a joke ? " <p> " Not really . " <p> " It 'll do you good to laugh : An Auschwitz survivor asks God to let him see the next worid . The request is granted and the Jew is escorted by a Sabra angel in blue and white striped wings to an opulent hotel suite where he is served gefilte fish , chicken soup , and cholent washed down with sweet red wine . Overjoyed that this will be his next abode  --  his final , permanent address  --  he returns to earth a happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually do , you know ... and when he comes to the next world , a sullen Yemenite angel scoots him off to a stifling fiberglass caravan in the middle of a desert  --  and treats him to warm water and burnt falafel . The survivor is aghast . <p> ' But this is not what God promised me when I asked Him . This is not what my eyes had seen , my mouth had tasted . I 've been cheated by God . I 'll never trust anybody again . Never , never again . ' <p> The angel scowls and says , ' Pilgrim , last time you came as a tourist , now you 're just another slob immigrant . ' Good joke , heh ? " <p> Alex locked his big hands on Boris 's elbow and gave him a somber look . " A year ago , you sported ponytail and earrings  --  now , a newborn Hasid , you dangle ropes of hair about your cheeks and twirl tassels of thread about your thighs . Make jokes about God and next year  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's better in God 's eyes that I complain with a joke than complain with a complaint . " <p> " We should n't complain , Boris . It 's still better for us to squat in Jerusalem with a falafel in hand than stand and chew the cud on a Moscow breadline . " <p> Alex decided to walk back home , take the car , and drive to the Old City , near Ecce Homo . The Christian Arabs there had the best falafel , using only virgin oil . He said nothing as Boris fell into step with him . Alex walked up his driveway , fished in his pocket and pulled out a set of car keys . <p> Boris looked up at the house . " Your new place ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Must be nice having a wife wait for you on ritzy Emek Repha'im , living as if the Messiah has already come ... When the Messiah really comes , most people wo n't cry  --  and some people , like you , wo n't laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Audi and plucked at the car 's windshield wipers . " You want the rubber to crack in this heat ? They stiffen up . Then they crack . Then they 're useless . Then they 're dangerous . Come the winter rains , you wo n't be able to see a soul in front of you . You want to kill somebody ? Yourself ? " <p> " I have n't the time . " <p> Boris 's mouth opened in feigned surprise . " Working real hard at your journalism gig ? " He whipped the wipers back from the glass . " How about taking me for a little ride ? " <p> Alex stared at Boris 's two front gold teeth . When would he have the guts to pull Boris 's skullcap off ? To wring his straggly red beard ? Alex inhaled deeply and let his anger slip away under the coattails of his exhaled breath . In his lifetime , he had met worse than Boris . In the Russian army , in Moscow med school , in the local soub . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boris did want to needle him , who was at fault ? He could expect meanness from Boris , a Ph.D . quality control engineer who now worked as a packer for a chicken schnitzel factory . Schnitzel slabs came whisking down the conveyor belt  --  and Boris had to be quick to swipe each frozen , breaded breast and slap it into a " Holy City Chicken " bucket . A lunatic from the Hundred-Gates section of town , a kosher supervisor-cumforeman , ran up and down the line chanting , " Breasts to the priests , thighs to the rabbis , hearts to the poor , gizzards to the rich , wings to the angels . Livers go to heaven and balls go to hell . " <p> Little wonder that Boris 's nerves were frayed . Were n't the Russians on Hosea Street still gossiping about Boris 's wife Celia ? It was clear , everybody was saying , why Boris spent most of his free time at the Western Wall praying for the Messiah to come . <p> Pity aside  --  the taste of the vomited fried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not going to offer his other cheek too quickly . " Sorry , Boris , I have to hurry to the supermarket and pick up dinner for Natasha and the children . Some Holy City Chicken maybe . " <p> Boris scaled his voice into an even lower pitch . " I have to take care of my kid myself . Without a wife . Believe me , it 's a lot better than keeping a whore around the house . " <p> Alex bit his lip . Boris 's gangly wife , a chambermaid at the Moriah hotel , was caught pulling her covers off for a wiry Arab poet . Boris did not forgive or forget . He played it by the book . Boris made sure he had photographs to prove it all ; he almost throttled the poet , and then claimed the poet attacked him with a pipe . He threw his wife out into the street and had the police arrest the poet . He posted a black-bordered mourning notice in the Hebrew papers declaring his wife to be a harlot . The rabbinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to pay Celia one shekel of alimony . <p> Boris 's wife counterattacked . She disclosed to the court that her inner space , from swan neck to thick ankles , caged gentile chromosomes  --  nary a smidgen of Jew genes . If she was not Jewish , then her daughter was not Jewish ; and a pious court must not allow the good Jew Boris to share living quarters with a nubile shiksa . The rabbis quickly buried Celia 's story . They decided she was indeed Jewish  --  therefore her offspring was Jewish  --  and they certainly were n't going to allow a whore to raise an innocent daughter of Israel . In the end , Celia trekked back to Odessa with her wan Arab in tow . <p> Alex looked down at the carpet of leaves on the lawn and got into the car . The seat was sticky , the wheel scalded his hand . Again , he had forgotten to cover the windshield with a sunscreen . He opened the door , bent down , and picked up a dead leaf . His naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key . The engine sputtered and died . Alex began to sweat . He tried the key again and the car roared . Pulling out of his driveway , Alex adjusted his rearview mirror to see Boris chewing on the ends of his beard . With his big white knitted skullcap plastered down on his hasidic-hippie locks , Boris looked as Jewish as a Jew was supposed to be . Good for Boris . He had few problems adjusting to local mores : a little lie now and then  --  hitched up to light thievery here and there . Boris had two black goats of belief drag his life along : An unshakable faith in the coming of the Messiah and a solemn vow not to play anyone 's chump . Like two sturdy rear-wheel shock springs , they served to cushion his journey on the potholed road linking the Kremlin to the Temple of Zion . <p> The irony was that Celia , who looked Jewish , was n't Jewish at all . If she could have proved she was n't Jewish the rabbis would have sent her with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be choking on his beard , alone , without his daughter . Alex winced . He had slept with Celia , before and after the Arab . He knew her parents . Salt of the earth people . Her Armenian mother worked as a water engineer ; her dead Tartar father had been a drunk sailor . <p> He went to the courthouse to testify Celia was telling the truth . But Boris chopped at him in front of the revolving door : " Do n't waste your breath . I know the way those rabbis think . First they ask themselves : ' Why would a Jew marry an ugly shiksa ? ' Then they answer their own question : ' Ipso facto , if she 's ugly and he married her anyway , she must , at least , be Jewish . ' They 'll believe me , not you ... You 're laughing ? Then listen good . I hate being tough . Two years ago , I told them you 're Jewish . But how would you like it if I enlightened them that Natasha  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said to be Celia 's spiritual twin . A dark-eyed gentile , Natasha looked tribal  --  the rabbis had signed her up as a Jew without even asking her one question . But they had earnestly flailed him ( the blond husband ) with the ritual fringes of suspicion . When he had come to register for his identity card  --  ten times , at least  --  they asked him if he was Jewish . They told him to prove it . He told them it was no one 's business , except his wife 's , to know whether he was circumcised or not . They kept on insisting he looked too Slavic . Boris had come before the rabbis to vouch he was indeed a Jew . <p> Alex rubbed his stubble chin . He certainly did look like the classic Slav . Broad forehead , thin blond-white hair , brown oriental eyes set far apart , tall , broad peasant build . When he met other Jews , they would hook their noses into a question mark wondering if he was really one of them . Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been his mother , a hundred-percent Jew ( the daughter of a renowned rabbi ) who even kept some arcane Jewish customs ; she often cooked chickpeas  --  boiling large vats of the round beans for a family come home with a newborn child , or for a family come home from burying its dead . <p> Alex looked again into the rear-view mirror ; up the block , he could see Boris eating a falafel and talking to Tsion . Tney were probably prattling about him and his wife  --  but he owed Boris . At least , he should have invited him to the party . <p> When his eyes shifted back to the windshield , Alex could almost see the belly button of the pedestrian staring him in the face . Alex hit the brakes hard . His car came to a screeching halt a half-meter in front of the sashaying girl . She stuck her tongue out at him as the car jumped forward , nearly hitting her . She stalked on , ignoring the bang of colliding cars . <p> " Crap on you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting . A cacophony of angry horns began . Alex got out to inspect the damage to the back of the Audi . Tne right taillight was smashed , the fender dangled like a hangman 's noose , and the exhaust pipe lay dead on the street . The tailgating cabby shook his forefinger in Alex 's face and shouted in a hoarse voice , " I 'm not going to pay you a damn agora You hear me ? " <p> Alex orchestrated his facial muscles into a blase , condescending smile . <p> The cabby 's eyes opened wide . He leaped on to the hood of the Audi and screamed at a metastasizing crowd , " This Russian wiseguy backs up into me and expects me to pay him . " <p> A dark-skinned Yemenite teenager with a silver filigreed chain dangling from his nostril shouted to no one in particular , " I want the Absorption Ministry to give me an Audi too . " <p> The cabby jumped up and down on the hood , trying to dent the steel . Failing , he jumped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't worry friends . I 'm nobody 's chump . I swear on my father 's grave , on my mother 's eyes ... this Jew is not going to make that stinking Bolshevik rich . " <p> The crowd jeered , coaxing Alex to counter the cabby 's assault with a heavy broadside of his own . Alex did not oblige . He got back into his car and started the motor . He stretched his neck out of his side window , gave the cabby an up-yours finger and zoomed off , the curses of his sparking , street-scraping exhaust pipe following him home . <p> Alex laughed to himself . A finger for a finger fit the crowd 's theological dispositions only too well . Praise the Lord ( a finger also for the Pharisees in the Ministry of Interior ) he had joined Jews for Jesus . Like himself , Jesus had been the perfect match of a peasant father and saintly mother , of coarseness and gentleness , of anger and forgiveness . To hell with the car . He could excuse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and meet Mutti . <p> Alex parked the car in his driveway and walked toward the falafel stand . Boris was nowhere to be seen . He saw Tsion look at him  --  but Tsion hardly registered that he knew him . <p> Alex shrugged his shoulders . He was n't going to buy a falafel from Tsion . He 'd rather take a cab to the Old City and buy falafel from the Christians . Nor would he vex himself about his failure to catch Boris ; that 's the way the matzo crumbles . Israel had toughened him up , making him less sentimental about moral perfection , more prone to casting away the cross of guilt . In the City of David , it was easy to forgive those who transgressed against you  --  for few believed in true sainthood . So it was possible to insult a man at dusk and , come dawn , share a glass of mint tea with him . Who could keep grudges in all this heat ? Perhaps , on a vast , freezing Russian steppe , war and peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two were only a stone 's throw away . Even for those who did believe in the possibility of perfection  --  for whom the act of forgiving was more of a problem  --  the local culture understood the nature of temptation  --  enough to tolerate even a saint living off a harlot . <p> A taxi cruised down the block , Alex waved for it to stop . He got into the front seat ; " Where to , Mister ' The man 's voice sounded hoarse . <p> Alex looked at the driver and gritted his teeth . It was the guy who had smashed his Audi . In Israel , there was no way to elude these embarrassments . Sooner or later he would bump into the guy who hit his car . Or meet the guy who screwed his wife . Alex gave the driver a blank look . <p> The driver stared back , pretending not to recognize Alex . He raised his voice , " I asked , Mister ... Where to , Mister ? " <p> " Falafel . " <p> The driver slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falafel ? Falafel Street ? And where , Mister , is that ? In Odessa ? " <p> " Near the Western Wall . " <p> The driver pulled into the parking lot near the Dung Gate . Alex put his hand in his back pocket . His wallet was not there . He felt something in his shirt pocket . It was a frayed business card that had somehow survived the soaks and spins of a punishing wash . <p> Alex flashed the card in the driver 's sullen face . " I have only this , nothing else . " <p> " No money ? " The driver bared his tobacco-stained front teeth . <p> Alex smiled . " I 'm sorry . I left everything  --  back on Emek Repha'im . " <p> " My very dear sir , if you think you 're going to make a chump out of me , forget it . Not me . I fought in four wars already . I lived in a tent for five years . I married four times , divorced three times , twice by the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In a minute , I 'll have every cousin of mine who 's a cop buzzing your fat tail . " <p> " Here .

" He patted Alex on the shoulder . <p> " Sounds like you got problems with your wife too . That 's what 's wrong with you Ashkenazis . You ca n't handle the women . My wife  --  a drop of hot sauce from her  --  and I stuff a falafel down her big mouth . " <p> " Give her the watch . " <p> " To the wife ? Mister , are you really such a donkey ?

A watch like that could get cramps from all the diamonds lying in its stomach . " <p> " Enjoy it in good health . " <p> " My health should be no concern of yours . And I got no more time to waste with you  --  or with some tax commando who tries to ambush me for not giving receipts .

Leave your house , kiss your mezuza again , give me my money  --  and I give you back your watch . " <p> Alex touched the man on the shoulder . " Thanks , but it 's not necessary . Keep the watch .

' Sounds superstitious to you ? Well , my father was absolutely right . Every time you get something for free , you have to pay with blood . Let me tell you : Most people are whores  --  and the Torah says you should n't live off whores . Like that government of ours : She gives me an apartment and then expects me to spend one month a year in the reserves , ready to get killed until I 'm forty-eight . You want me to take your watch ?

And I gave away the Bibles and three of the knives . But this year , I feel like I had to finally pay for those knives and Bibles : For my son 's bar mitzvah , for presents for my son 's friends ' bar mitzvahs . All the pishers get bar-mitzvahed in one year and I 'm ready to line up at the soup kitchen . Thank you , but no gifts for me . " <p> " If you want , I 'll grab a witness and give you the watch .

" You do n't want it , I do n't want it  --  then the garbage gets it . " <p> " What a genius You throw that Rolex away . Then , it belongs to nobody . I happen to find it . Understand me ? Then it 's my good luck . The only thing I must do  --  is thank God . " <p> Alex lay the watch on the ground . Time seemed to jog in place as he watched the driver get out and pick it up . <p> The driver pulled out his wallet . " Take some cash  --  and do n't say no . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back . " <p> Alex took the money and got out of the cab . He picked up a black paper skullcap from the basket near the police barricades and pressed his body against the cool wall . He looked at the business card in his hand . " Alex Kaminsky , Doctor of Medicine , Thirteen Emek Repha'im Street , Jerusalem . " He folded the card and stuffed it deep into a cleft between the ancient stones . The setting sun draped the Herodian stones in soft pink and cloaked the worshipers in dappled grey .
