These good friends share a world of hoops and high hopes . // Teresa Edwards and Katrina McClain of USA Basketball shoot for the moon , and for the gold . They 've been to Olympic Games before-three times for Teresa ( two gold and one bronze medal ) , two times for Katrina ( one gold and one bronze medal ) and are back for more , Atlanta style . Yet the Games seem far away this particular day . Katrina bounds onto the court wearing a warm-up jacket with a little ink smudge that turns out to be Bill Clinton 's autograph . " We the USA National Team jogged with him once at 6 a.m. near the White House , " she explains , grinning at the " **25;56;TOOLONG " question . " Could we keep up with him is the question . I thought we would have to run slow , but I was breathing hard . He talked a bit with us-he 's a big basketball fan . " Katrina and " T , " as Teresa is called , are getting used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentum in the world of sports . It 's a far cry from the mid-eighties when the women were roommates at The University of Georgia , winning championships and bonding . " I 'd go to practice and get knocked down when I was a freshman , " recalls Katrina . " The coach would yell at me ; then I 'd go back to our room and T would yell at me . " Teresa explains , " I saw a great person who was a great basketball player , and I told her she had to fight back . It 's as if she thought they were supposed to do that , but she changed quick . " Their talent , even at its finest , could n't find a home after college-at least not in this country . Teresa headed to Italy to be one of three U.S. players on a professional team ; Katrina joined a Japanese team as its lone American . " I learned the language after four years , " Katrina confesses . " At least enough to get by . " In subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning to Japan , while Teresa contributed her talents as a guard in Spain , Japan , and France . The two friends , never on the same professional team simultaneously , kept in touch through letters . " Initially it 's scary , but then you learn that everyone speaks the same language on the court , " says Teresa , who shot balls into a garbage can as a child in her native Cairo , Georgia . " It 's life off the court that 's really tough to deal with . You spend a lot of dollars on the phone . The money around $250,000 per season is good , but the life is n't terrific . " Katrina nods . " You 're thinking , ' I ca n't get on the bus and go home , ' " says the native of Charleston , South Carolina . " When you 're not playing basketball , you 're sitting there wondering how many days until you can leave . " Teresa reflects for a moment , then adds , " It 's been a great experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I 'd trade the years for anything-but enough is enough . " What perfect timing for the American Basketball League ( ABL ) , an eight-city professional circuit that begins this October . As founding members , Katrina and Teresa will enthusiastically compete for the ABL 's Atlanta-based team once the Olympic Games are over . Photograph " We are out for gold !

" Katrina McClain ( left ) , with Teresa Edwards // " We have the opportunity to stay home and make something that little girls can look up to , " says Teresa , passionate on the subject . " We both have an opportunity to make history-being part of the Olympic team , starting up the ABL . We can look back over our lives as old women with canes and really appreciate what we 've done . I like the fact that I 'm able to give back all I 've gotten from basketball . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Opening Ceremonies of the Olympic Games fall on July 19 , Teresa 's 32nd birthday , and she 's psyched . So is Katrina . Their excitement builds as the talk turns into fast-break banter . Katrina : " In the tip-off , when the ball goes up , the fun starts . " Teresa : " I do n't think we could do it if we were n't having fun . " Katrina : " Yeah , but I can be mean on the court . " Teresa : " We just ca n't stand to lose . " Katrina : " And we work hard not to . We do n't play dirty , but we play serious-very , very serious . " Teresa pauses once again , as if screening a film of the future on fastforward . " I 'd hate to think we 'd go this long and do all this work and not get the gold . We ai n't having no picnic , trust me . We are out for gold !
