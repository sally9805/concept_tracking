Molecules still shift whenever Dan Rostenkowski walks into a room . Everyone looks up and shrinks a little to make space for one of the most powerful lawmakers in Congress . But while the chairman of the House Ways and Means &lt; Committee should be in his glory as he oversees the passage of President Clinton 's tax bill , he is stuck beneath the darkest cloud of his career . The prospect that Rostenkowski may soon be indicted and stripped of his chairmanship has placed his ability to help Clinton in serious doubt . And the potential loss of Rostenkowski 's deft political skills makes some Democrats fear that the rest of the President 's legislative agenda could be in trouble . " We 're worried about what happens down the road with health care , the North American Free Trade Agreement and all the other things we have to get through Ways and Means , " a senior Administration official concedes . <P> The threat of prosecution grew more ominous for Rostenkowski last week , when a former House postmaster Robert Rota pleaded guilty to embezzlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rota said he had helped lawmakers illegally swap stamp vouchers for cash for nearly 20 years . While he named the most prominent offenders only as Congressman A and Congressman B , sources close to the prosecution identified Congressman A as Rostenkowski and Congressman B as former Pennsylvania Representative Joe Kolter , who was defeated last year . Rota indicated that Rostenkowski had used vouchers to embezzle $21,300 over a six-year period , but it remained unclear whether the money was used for office or personal use . Separately , federal investigators are still probing charges that Rostenkowski converted hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign funds to his personal use , partly by cashing the checks at the post-office window . Asserted Rostenkowski at a Saturday press conference : " I have engaged in no illegal or unethical conduct . I 'm frustrated and angry at these allegations . " <P> The disclosures rattled Rostenkowski 's colleagues and constituents . While the Ways and Means chairman often comes off as gruff and arrogant on camera , he is a Washington institution . " By golly , I 've known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House minority leader Robert Michel . " I ca n't believe he 'd do any such thing  --  it 's just not like our Danny . " <P> The lengthy probe has dampened Rostenkowski 's spirits and raised the possibility that even if he is cleared , the 65-year-old Congressman will quit next year . " This has all been very difficult for him and his family , " says Raymond McGrath , a close friend and former Congressman . " They 've subpoenaed his daughters , many of his friends and his secretaries in Chicago . " When + people ask Rostenkowski how he 's doing these days , he 's likely to shoot back , " How the hell do you think I 'm doing ? " <P> The disclosures last week set up a race between a possible indictment of Rostenkowski and completion of the budget bill now before a 14-member House- Senate conference subcommittee . Sources close to the U.S. Attorney 's office said an indictment could come in late August , after Congress adjourns for its summer recess .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
