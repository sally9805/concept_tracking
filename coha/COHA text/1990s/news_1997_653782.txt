<p> With the stock market swinging more wildly this year than it has in a long time , Billie Taylor is a bit more cautious about his investments . <p> Although he still has 80 percent of his money in equities , he has pulled back from the market , gently tip-toeing away from stocks . <p> " Right now I 'm sitting on as high a level of cash as I 've had in 10 years , " said Mr. Taylor , a 57-year-old retired schoolteacher in Kettering , Ohio . " I 'm somewhere on the fence because the pundits say that every time this happens the market 's in for a major change . " <p> Like millions of other investors , Mr. Taylor has been watching the increasingly sharp day-to-day moves in the stock market . Ups and downs of 1 percent or more have become commonplace in the stock market 's major indexes . So far this year , such fluctuations have accounted for almost 3 of every 10 daily changes in the Dow , more than four times the pace of 1995 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks has shown the same volatility . <p> And the even bigger swings have been spectacular . The Dow had a 247-point , 3.1 percent , drop on Aug. 15 only to be followed two weeks later by a 257 point , 3.4 percent , rise . And while the market was calm yesterday , with the Dow slipping just 21.83 points , to 7,721.14 , it had two moves of 1 percent just last week . <p> So even though the stocks in the Dow and the S. &; P. 500 are having very good years , those 20 percent gains have been coming in an increasingly volatile environment . While this volatility has been rising from very low levels since early 1996 , by many measures it is now well above average , flashing warning signals even among seasoned Wall Street strategists . <p> " Volatility tends to pick up when you get to turning points , " said Robert Farrell , a longtime strategist at Merrill Lynch . " Occasionally , high volatility does occur in an up year without a sinister result . But a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To be sure , a number of Wall Street analysts remain relatively unconcerned about the increasing volatility . Abby Joseph Cohen , the widely followed strategist at Goldman , Sachs , argues that current volatility is still not particularly far above normal and that the economic fundamentals  --  steady growth , low inflation , moderate interest rates  --  remain positive and thus dampen the risk of a significant downturn . <p> Still , many analysts  --  while not predicting that a big downturn is necessarily just over the horizon  --  are growing increasingly concerned . <p> " Does this parallel to 1987 suggest market action will play out the same way as 10 years ago ? " Gail Dudack , the chief investment strategist at UBS Securities , asked in a recent report . " Not at all . But this is a warning that should be heeded . " <p> For investors , the increase in volatility can have two contradictory effects . It can make some nervous enough to change their outlook and their investment strategy , while others may be lulled into complacency . <p> On one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and makes them reconsider their positions , " said Robert J. Shiller , a professor of economics at Yale University and an expert on investor behavior . " Volatility is a clue that other people are re-evaluating , and so investors have a rule of thumb : when in doubt , imitate others . " <p> On the other hand , increasing volatility as the market is still rising can lull investors . They may see a 200-point fall one day only as volatility that will be followed by a sharp rebound . This means it could take investors longer to see that the fundamental market direction has turned . <p> Some of this contradictory impact can be seen in the ebb and flow of money into stock mutual funds . Despite the rise in volatility this year , the $150 billion flow into stock funds through August is just 6.6 percent behind last year 's record-setting pace and is the second highest ever . And weekly data from AMG Data Services show that in two weeks in August when volatility was high , investors withdrew more money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that Wall Street analysts measure volatility is to calculate how many trading sessions register moves of more than 1 percent from one day 's close to the next . By that measure , this year has been more turbulent than most . <p> The Dow has moved 1 percent or more in 29.2 percent , or 52 , of the trading days . That is up from 16.9 percent last year and the recent lows of 6.8 percent in 1995 and 6.3 percent in 1993 . And this year 's performance is well above the average since 1940 of 17.2 percent , Paine Webber says . <p> The 29.2 percent figure so far this year is well below the most volatile years since 1940  --  47 percent for 1974 and 38.3 percent in 1987 , years when the market suffered sharp declines . But it is higher than other turbulent periods , like 1990 , when investors were rattled by the Persian Gulf war and this measure of volatility jumped to 28.9 percent . <p> Another gauge of volatility gives more weight to larger percentage moves and measures daily movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called standard deviation , the volatility of daily changes in the S. &; P. 500 is well above the median level since 1940 of 0.72 percent . Current volatility , calculated by this measure , is 1.05 percent . <p> By this measure , market volatility is also well above that of the 1960 's , the era most resembling today . The low-inflation environment is similar , and some analysts point to the strong market then as support for the argument that current stocks are not particularly overvalued . But in only one period  --  during 1962  --  from 1957 through 1969 did volatility get as high as it is now . <p> Analysts offer many reasons for the higher volatility these days . Some argue that the market is jittery because of the high prices investors are now paying for stocks compared with their expected earnings potential , so that even a whiff of unexpected news about a particular company can send certain stocks reeling . <p> Others say it flows from a surge in computer-aided program trading , which is one reason the stock market has recently made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Experts also cite the shift to allowing price changes of as little as one-sixteenth of a dollar rather than the long-standing one-eighth . And still others say that the rise in volatility is just making up for lost time from the very low volatility of 1993 and 1995 . <p> Ms. Cohen , the bullish strategist at Goldman , Sachs , said that stocks were exceptionally undervalued through the mid-1990 's , which helped hold down volatility . But as share prices rose , and stocks have became what she called " fairly valued , " investors have turned edgier . <p> She likened the situation to shopping . " Let 's say you go shopping and buy for $50 an item that 's worth $100 , " Ms. Cohen said . " You bring it home and find it has a little ding in it . If you only paid $50 for it , you 're not likely to be upset . But if you paid closer to full price , you may be a bit more agitated . That may be a good analogy for our market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more volatile than normal but does not know if that will continue . " What matters to me , " she said , " is a fundamental turning point . And I do n't see that there is a major fundamental disruption at this time . " <p> Justin Mamis , an analyst who has been tracking and charting the market since the 1950 's , suggested that the length of this bull market is starting to tear at the emotions of investors , as some are selling shares at huge profits , while others are trying to get in on the astronomical gains of their neighbors and co-workers . <p> But whatever the reason , there is little doubt that high volatility has usually been associated with significant turns in the market . <p> " Our conclusion is that the consistently high volatility , up and down , is indicative of a market in transition , " usually downward , said Steven Leuthold , head of the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis . <p> Tim Hayes , senior equity strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice , Fla. , says volatility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks to relatively high levels after market peaks . " <p> Still , some strategists , like Mr. Farrell at Merrill Lynch , are not sure what to make of this period . " I would treat it as a caution flag , " he said , " without implying it 's 1929 . " <p> Jeremy J. Siegel , a professor of finance at the Wharton School , warns that one of the biggest dangers in the current rise in volatility is that it can whipsaw investors into making bad decisions with their money . <p> " Volatility is harmful , " he said , " if you let it affect your psyche and your long-term goals . " <p> As for Mr. Taylor , the retired teacher , he is content to just wait on the sidelines and let the market run its course . " Sometimes , my Daddy used to say , you need to just lay back in the weeds and wait a while . And that 's just what I 'm doing .
