Frankly , I 'm terminally annoyed with the continual characterizations of the East as an icehouse . You know , vile , offhand remarks like the one in the December 1993 issue of Outside . Slalom skis , we are told , " work well for folks condemned to spend Saturdays clinging to East Coast ice . " It 's the same jive , winter after winter : " Eastern powder " as an oxymoron . You 're skeptical . But I live here in Vermont , and I know what I ski . Two winters ago , I stopped counting after no dozen powder days at Stowe . For most of last winter we had nothing but fresh snow and cold constant enough to keep it light . After the first month of powder days piled up , it got hard to keep them straight . I have one notation on my calendar for a day in February : " Girls , Goat , Two Feet . " Which I think refers to getting first tracks with the Valkyries  --  a girl gang of tele skiers  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trail 's entrance was , if not exactly down , sagging severely . We whooped ( mostly obscenely ) in delight . It was huge : The VW bumps toward the bottom were buried , we would find . Dropping a knee on tele skis  --  after all , the lower you get , the deeper the snow  --  we crested and dipped . It reminded me of the hide-and-seek feel I have while paddling my sea kayak in big waves , when a partner a wave away disappears in the trough , only to reappear , lifted by another wave . We biffed , we surfaced , and sometimes we simply cruised . Last winter , I was on the quad with a kid who had just moved here . Below us , on Lift Line , over a foot of powder was being sliced and diced . Intermittent whoops were emanating from the woods . " I do n't get it , " he said , looking down . " Everybody here can ski powder . But , like , when do they get a chance to practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days a year , right ? " I was happy to set him straight and told him I 'd already had about 10 powder days , starting on November 1 , when we climbed for a natural foot above the blasting snow guns . It may be true , I allowed , that Eastern skiers , as you often hear , ski powder well because they ski ice well . But my best guess is that they ski powder well because , well , they ski powder . Granted , we do n't get the monster dumps . But we do get snow . Jay Peak , near the Canadian border , cites an average 319 inches a season , courtesy of a powder funnel from the St. Lawrence River , unimpeded by adjacent , snow-intercepting mountains . Last winter Jay garnered a lavish 427 inches  --  Utah proportions . Indeed , my friend Kim will tell you  --  and it does n't take much prompting  --  that Stowe 's 250 average inches exceed those of Crested Butte or Sun Valley : " I 've looked it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western acreage , so the snow gets skied off faster . That 's why skiers here must be particularly resourceful . The same powder-skiing rules that apply anywhere have been whittled to an art form in the East . Here are a few . Call them Skiing Eastern Powder Tips Compressed . A little redundant , but it does come out to SKEPTIC  --  and that acronym certainly fits . SKEPTIC #1 : Be powder-prepared . Basically , you have to sharpen your nose along with your skis . Attend to weather reports the way some would the daily NASDAQ listings . And be ready to roll . What 's Woody Allen say  --  " Half of life is just showing up " ? Likewise skiing Eastern powder . I could go into a long harangue on how powder happens in the East . It 's more than the kindly kidney punch of a nor'easter , as a storm forms off the New England coast and curls back inland to bury cities and ski areas . It 's the mystery stuff  --  orographic , or whatever it 's called  --  when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clouds formed over Lake Champlain as they pass over the spine of the Green Mountains . The guys who patrol Stowe do n't call our snow champagne powder as much as Champlain powder . Of course , for every Big One you catch , you 'll miss one . You 'll cop pretty good snow , only to realize that you should have been and  --  given ski-area proximity in the East  --  could have been elsewhere . For example , I went up Mount Mansfield one day for some post-storm tree skiing . On the gondola , I talked with a visitor who 'd just arrived . He asked how it was . I tried to ease off on the rhapsody of shots that were knee deep . " Good for us too , " he countered . " That would be ... ? " I asked . " Maine , " he said . " Sugarloaf . Chest deep off the Snowfields . " A couple more SKEPTICS. #2 : Ski early . You know  --  you snooze , you lose . Stowe opens at s on weekdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7:30 . It 's a great place to transact business . Looking at the other locals , I 've realized that I could arrange to have an addition put on my house , a will drawn up , my computer fixed , and get physical therapy . There 's the feel of a barely contained land rush in the air  --  the only thing anyone 's waiting for is the first chair . After that , it 's strictly keep up or be dropped . Which suggests SKEPTIC #3 : Forget the warmup run on easy terrain . You want the good stuff , the steeps before they 've been hacked , then go for it  --  everyone else is . There are a couple of corollaries . SKEPTIC #4 : Ski the edges . As one friend said , describing the frantic progress of a powder day , " the trails go first , then the obvious trees , then the deep trees . " But you 've come late to the party , delayed by minor distractions , like feeding the kids . The really good stuff 's gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can avoid the crudfest by heading for intermediate terrain , often ignored by fanatics . Since most tourists ski down the center of the trails , you hug the edges . It may be bottom feeding , but more likely than not , there 's powder to be found . When there 's powder to be devoured , Easterners clean their plates . I skied at Solitude , Utah , two winters ago . It had n't snowed in a week , and the locals were bummed . We Easterners were happy idiots and merry minimalists , scouring the hill and finding stashes everywhere . SKEPTIC #5 : Know which way the wind blows . It 's pretty simple . A storm clears out on the back of a big blow . For the powder skier , wind is the natural equivalent of snowmaking . The snow does n't leave the county , it just gets rearranged . Mostly in the trees or on the sides of trails , where the trees form a natural snow fence . " Of course people do n't think there 's powder here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's not on the trails , " he says , and then quickly jerks a thumb toward the woods , " it 's in there . " Wind , he will later say , constantly rebuilds the powder stash : " If you understand wind , you can find powder . " The powder 's there , it 's just protected . Which is why a dump of just a foot can be crotch-deep in the trees . And so it was for three straight days at the end of February last winter . A foot each day , on the trails . To my thighs , in the trees . Ibuprofen consumption in the red zone ; wild-eyed babbling in the ale houses . It 's a little crazy in the East . The year before last , in early December , I was lounging about the house on a Sunday morning . It had been pretty dry  --  not even enough snow to cross-country ski . I was n't keen on going up to Stowe to ski on thin manmade . So I called my neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north to Craftsbury to sniff out enough cover for a reasonable ski tour . In passing , Cyn asked if I had heard on public radio that Orleans got 10 inches . In an instant I was alert . I knew she would n't mind my bolting the conversation to call a little west of Orleans to Jay Peak . It was evidently too early in the season for the marketing department 's snow report . Instead , I got the night watchman , whose rich Vermont cockney suggested deep local roots . " Been snowin " since midnight , mistah . Got two feet , and it 's still comin ' down . Ca n't see a goddam thing . " " You 'll see us in an hour , " I muttered , thanking him . I not only wanted company ; I wanted an approach vehicle for what I reckoned would be some desperate driving . I quickly called up the hill , and my neighbor Bill , a ski instructor , maitre d ' ' , and summertime landscaper , was hooked . Fifteen minutes later he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear axle and plenty of weight were enough to get to Jay and through its parking lot , where the few scattered cars were buried . We were a sorry-looking pair , surprised by snow , having rummaged frantically to find and accumulate clothing and gear . My side-zip pants were overdue for duct-taping ; their label should have been amended to read " Pata-far-gone-ia . " Unable to find his goggles , Bill substituted a ridiculous plastic windshield he used for cross-country training that sticks onto the brow of his hat with Velcro , giving him a kind of Spartacus-tries-slalom look . No matter . The powder was over our knees , in our faces , down our collars . We swooped and sliced and , when we burrowed , sent up geysers . Forget the early-season indignities . That familiar powder feeling  --  dropping , compressing , and surfacing again , the squeeze and float  --  was back . Idiots lost in fluff . " I 've skied in this state for 17 years , " Bill said . " It does n't get any better than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
