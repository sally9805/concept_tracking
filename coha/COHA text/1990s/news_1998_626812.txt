<p> A year ago , Colorado was a popular pick to finally jump past Nebraska . The Buffaloes made the summer magazine covers . The Buffaloes were an occasional national-championship pick . And the Cornhuskers seethed publicly . <p> This season , Kansas State - with considerably less impressive long-term credentials - has become the popular pick to surpass the Cornhuskers as the bully of the Big 12 North block . Nebraska has won 39 consecutive regular-season conference games . The Cornhuskers have beaten Kansas State in each of their previous 29 meetings , usually in complete and humiliating routs that includes a 56-26 walk last year , long after the Wildcats supposedly arrived at the Cornhuskers ' level . <p> And with so many ready to ignore such trends to expect a most hostile takeover , the Cornhuskers do n't seem to mind , at least not enough to complain . <p> " It does n't bother us , " fullback Joel Makovicka said . " Kansas State will be a great team in the Big 12 . " <p> About the strongest statement offered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jay Foreman . <p> " That 's just what people write , " Foreman said . " As a team , it makes us more focused , more together . When people say it 's Kansas State 's year to win and Nebraska 's year to lose , it make us more focused . " <p> But unlike last season , it did not seem to make the Cornhuskers angry . The difference could be the good feelings left over from last season 's share of the national championship or the lack of bad feelings about Kansas State . <p> But it is tempting to believe the difference this year from last is on the field , where Nebraska has some genuine concerns and Kansas State 's biggest worries appear to be choosing between talents at positions unusually deep . <p> For Nebraska , everything begins with its signature offensive line and it would be impossible for the Cornhuskers to feel as sure of the engine that drives the Nebraska machine as they did a year ago . <p> New coach Frank Solich will not lose sleep wondering where he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from last season , he can not feel as comfortable as Tom Osborne did last season . And to that change , he will have to move the talented , but inexperienced Bobby Newcombe to quarterback and rely heavily on DeAngelo Evans to remain healthy at tailback . <p> " You do n't have to be a new coach to be a little nervous when you do n't have your offensive line returning , your quarterback returning or I-back returning , " Solich said . " Bobby Newcombe and ( expected backup ) Eric Crouch , how they fit in , how it all will work , remains to be seen . Bobby is a tremendous athlete . He did a great job as a receiver . He was a big-play guy . It was not an easy decision to move Bobby to quarterback . He made so many big plays as a punt returner and wide receiver , we were a little hesitant to change his positions . We did that and he has potential to be a great quarterback . " <p> Solich was so convinced he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add a game , Aug. 29 against Louisiana Tech in the Eddie Robinson Football Classic . <p> Kansas State coach Bill Snyder chose to stick to his plan of playing only bad teams in Manhattan , Kan. , in non-conference games . Although Kansas State was next in line for the Robinson game had Nebraska turned it down , Snyder passed on games that would have forced his team to pack a bag . <p> The strategy , he said , has worked to build Kansas State from one of college football 's biggest losers to a preseason No. 6 this year . But there is a change in the schedule that also could help Kansas State . <p> Instead of filling up on cupcakes immediately before taking on the Cornhuskers , Kansas State will not face Nebraska until Nov. 14 when the Wildcats will have faced competition closer to their own size . <p> But Snyder will have to make sure his team does not spend so much time looking ahead to Nebraska that it looks past the teams in the way , or builds the meeting with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle such matters of mind-set , about all that is left for Snyder to concern himself with is " chemistry . " A team that grew stronger last season until it manhandled Syracuse in the Fiesta Bowl , Kansas State brings back almost every starter , its kicker and punter and another talented recruiting haul including junior-college running back Frank Murphy . <p> " The chemistry . . . to me is significant and extremely important , " Snyder said . " It 's easy for anyone to say , ' You 've got 18 , 19 starters coming back , why are you talking about chemistry ? ' The chemistry with this football team will not be the same as it was in the 1997 year . It will be either better or worse . It wo n't stay the same . All circumstances are different . The expectations are different today than they were a year ago . Everything is different . So we have to help guys in the right direction . " <p> That said , a lot of coaches would like to have his problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nebraska , took the Cornhuskers to overtime and advanced to a bowl with its first winning season since 1983 . <p> Answering a few major question marks will be the key to the Tigers ' chances . Despite the return of all-conference quarterback Corby Jones , Missouri must prove it can run the ball on offense and stop the run on defense . <p> But the Tigers will work on those areas feeling better about themselves than they have in more than a decade . <p> " Morale is high , momentum is high , " Missouri coach Larry Smith said . " It was a great , outstanding recruiting year , maybe the best I 've ever been associated with . From the alumni standpoint , the season-ticket standpoint , excitement around the state , people got a smile on their face . I never saw so many people so happy over a 7-4 season . The whole state is beside itself . " <p> Colorado , on the other hand , was badly shaken by its unexpected slide to 5-6 ( later officially reduced to 0-11 because an ineligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rick Neuheisel must find a new quarterback . He will choose between Jeremy Weisinger of Uvalde and Adam Bledsoe . And he must suffer through growing pains on both lines . <p> And with a high-profile opener against Colorado State , pressure building since last season will increase rapidly if Colorado struggles early . <p> " Unfortunately , when you have a season like we experienced last year , it takes a while to get that taste out of your mouth , " Neuheisel said . " You have to wait until you play again . " <p> Kansas and Iowa State must have similar hurt feelings . Kansas ended the season losing five of six , beating only Iowa State . The Cyclones lost their last five in a 1-10 season . <p> " We have bottomed out and now have a foundation built out of rock instead of sand , " Iowa State coach Dan McCarney said . " We have a legitimate Division I defense for the first time this year , and the junior-college kids ( he signed 18 ) give us some depth . We wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tongues hanging down to the ground at the end of the game . " <p> Second-year Kansas coach Terry Allen also will need to find improvement in his specialty . Just as the longtime defensive coach McCarney has struggled to bring a successful defense to his program , the offensive whiz Allen must rebuild his team 's attack . <p> " We were dead last in offense nationally last season , and we return 10 starters from the 1997 team , " Allen said . " We are going to present a little different offensive package and do a few things differently with personnel on offense . Last season , we were just throwing around pins and needles and hoping that something will stick . " <p> But most of the talk around the north end of the Big 12 is not on making an offense at Kansas or defense at Iowa State stick . The question most ask is at the other end of the division where Kansas State will try to complete a far more unusual transformation .
