<p> Wayne Smith once wandered the District streets late at night , trying to score one more hit of cocaine and begging God to deliver him from his addiction . He wound up serving three years at Lorton Reformatory on drug charges , and when he was released in 1992 , he was determined to build a new life . <p> Today , Smith owns a janitorial service with 25 employees  --  some of them former offenders and addicts he is trying to help . He is married , active in a church prison ministry , and , at age 40 , studying to be a registered nurse . <p> " It 's been rough , but I finally came out of my addiction . Now I want to give something back to the community , " said Smith . " My children see me as a strong man and a good provider . My employees say I have inspired them . For the first time , I see a real future . " <p> But Smith , a legal immigrant from Trinidad who came here at age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his crime . Last spring , federal immigration agents knocked on his door and arrested him . Several months later , he was ordered deported by an immigration judge in Baltimore , based on his original drug charges . He has appealed the order , but he and his lawyer say his chances of winning are slim . <p> Last year , a tough new immigration law retroactively expanded the range of crimes for which federal authorities can deport legal residents . In addition to such serious felonies as murder , armed robbery and drug trafficking , which already were grounds for deportation , the list now includes lesser offenses such as shoplifting , credit card fraud , simple assault and drug use , as long as the defendant was sentenced to at least one year 's probation . <p> The new law also severely limits an immigration judge 's authority to grant exceptions , no matter how long ago the immigrant committed the crime , or how well he has behaved since then . It also makes it possible to block any immigrant convicted of such a crime from reentering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tries to return he can consequently be held in custody until deported . <p> Supporters say the law is a necessary tool for getting rid of undesirable immigrants , especially violent or habitual criminals who have escaped deportation for years . Over the past year , the Immigration and Naturalization Service has deported more than 45,000 foreigners convicted of crimes by U.S. courts . <p> In the Washington area , 1,043 criminal aliens were arrested in the past year , an increase from the previous year of nearly 200 percent . In one Texas operation in March , INS agents arrested and deported more than 1,000 immigrants who had been convicted of charges that included murder , armed robbery and child molestation . <p> " I feel that law-abiding people , not hardened criminals , should be filling our priceless immigration slots , " Sen. Spencer Abraham said in a speech last week . The Michigan Republican chairs a Senate immigration subcommittee . " Until last year 's bill , " Abraham said , " only a tiny percentage of deportable criminal aliens had actually been deported . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often sweeping up decent people in a dragnet that ought to be aimed at serious offenders . They note that many of the crimes for which immigrants can now be deported are misdemeanors under criminal law , for which judges rarely sentence offenders to jail . <p> In recent weeks , an especially dramatic case in New York has focused public attention on the law 's far-reaching consequences . Jesus Collado , a 43-year-old legal immigrant and restaurant manager from the Dominican Republic , was returning from a vacation in his homeland last spring when he was arrested by immigration agents at John F. Kennedy International Airport and imprisoned . <p> It turned out that 23 years before , when Collado was 19 , he had been convicted of sexual misconduct and sentenced to one year 's probation after the mother of his 15-year-old girlfriend complained to police that they were having sex . Under the new law , Collado can be deported for his misdemeanor and held without bond in the meantime . <p> Collado 's family mounted a campaign to publicize his plight , and a documentary film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother of his long-ago girlfriend wrote the immigration authorities , saying she now feels " extremely guilty " about having gotten him in trouble , and comparing their teenage romance to Romeo and Juliet . <p> On Friday , immigration officials released Collado after more than six months in federal custody , citing a new INS rule on detentions that took effect this week . The rule gives INS district directors temporary authority to free certain legal immigrants who were stopped when reentering the country , although they still face eventual deportation under the law . <p> " This is the most terrible thing I have ever been through , " Collado said by telephone shortly after his release from a detention center in York , Pa . " I understand they are trying to stop crime , but this new law is also destroying families as a result . I have always worked hard for my wife and children . To take me away from them is just so cruel . " <p> In an interview last week in the Manhattan restaurant he manages , Collado 's family recounted how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car accident while he was in prison , and how desperate he had been to visit her in the hospital . Wearing a metal body brace , Julissa tearfully described Collado as a doting but strict father , who had been especially critical when she dated older boys . <p> Immigration officials said the year-old law leaves them no choice but to start deportation proceedings against people who committed crimes that are now considered " aggravated felonies , " whenever they are encountered . Usually , the INS discovers the immigrant 's criminal record either because he applied for citizenship or returned from a trip abroad and was questioned by an inspector at an airport . <p> As a result , thousands of immigrants across the country face expulsion for past crimes . Some are recent , violent crimes , but others are minor offenses that occurred a decade or more ago . Among those who are vulnerable under the new law : <p> * Oscar Pereira , a 29-year-old District man from El Salvador who works at a late-night parking lot . He was convicted of carrying an unregistered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection from muggers  --  and given one year 's probation . Now , immigration authorities have ordered him deported , and he has appealed . In the past , he could have sought an exemption because of his otherwise clean record and U.S.-born children , but the new law does not allow it . <p> * An Iranian cab driver from Virginia , who asked that his name not be used . He was arrested at a student protest outside the White House in the late 1970s , convicted of assault and given 18 months ' probation . This year , the 40-year-old man was planning to apply for citizenship , but his lawyer has advised him that if he submits his application , or leaves the country and tries to return , he will probably be ordered deported . <p> * A 22-year-old Salvadoran man from Boston , Rafael Bardales , who was involved in a street gang when he was a teenager , and convicted of robbery and assault . He received two years ' probation , joined a Catholic church and became an active volunteer in its missions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic to build churches . When they reentered the United States , the man was arrested and is awaiting deportation . <p> After a Washington Post reporter reached Bardales at the detention center in York , more than a dozen other immigrants being detained there for past crimes , most of whom had been arrested while returning from trips abroad , called The Post seeking help . <p> Abraham charged that authorities " seem to be pursuing some admittedly minor cases aggressively . . . while letting some hardened criminals in jail go free . " He said he plans to hold hearings on the matter . <p> Immigration officials acknowledged that the new law is having a harsh impact on one-time minor offenders , but said their hands are tied because Congress , in seeking to crack down on immigrants who commit crimes , left both the INS and immigration judges with little room for flexibility or leniency in applying the rules . <p> " They cast a big net , and they 're catching some dolphins in it , " said Russ Bergeron , an INS spokesman . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of such cases are as extreme as Collado 's . The way the new law is written , Bergeron said , immigration officials do not " have sufficient discretionary authority any longer to adequately address exceptional circumstances . " <p> Short of changing the law , immigration lawyers say , the only remedies for former offenders facing deportation are expensive , time-consuming and often fruitless . One is to ask a member of Congress to submit a private bill on behalf of the immigrant . Another is to request a pardon from the governor of one 's state . A third is to seek to have the original conviction overturned or expunged from the record . <p> In interviews , several immigrants facing deportation said they tried to have their original convictions reviewed , without success . Lawyers said state executives rarely pardon people for such cases , and that submitting a private bill in Congress requires expensive legal work and takes many months to work its way through the political process . <p> Stephen Converse , a lawyer in Pennsylvania who represents Collado and a number of other immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " In theory , you can do something , but you need time and money . So you get an ordinary immigrant who committed a youthful indiscretion , and suddenly it comes back as a horrible offense , and there 's virtually nothing he can do . "
