ART IS HARD <P> Is there anything sweeter than the perfectly executed hoax ? DAVID BOWIE , novelist William Boyd and others nearly pulled one off with the launch of the first book from Bowie 's new publishing venture . It 's Boyd 's biography of little-known Abstract Expressionist painter NAT TATE , who , at 31 , committed suicide after meeting Picasso and Braque and destroying most of his work , except the painting above . At the book party , English journalist David Lister asked guests if they had heard of Tate . Many had . Bad call . After very little digging , Lister discovered that Tate , photo and all , was a fiction . Boyd did the painting . <P> OUT BY THE OUTHOUSE <P> GEORGE MICHAEL gave a little public performance last week in a bathroom at a park in Beverly Hills . It did not go well . The audience was an undercover cop who not only did n't recognize the singer but also arrested him for performing a " lewd act . " To add insult to arrest , Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , who wrote in a tab : " When push comes to shove , we are sisters under the skin . " Boy was right . On Friday night Michael expressed regret for the embarrassing incident and admitted on CNN that he is in a relationship with a man . Asked why he was outing himself now , Michael said , " I 've already kind of done that , have n't I ? " <P> HE IS HEAVY , HE 'S MY HALF BROTHER <P> When he was nine , ERIC CLAPTON discovered the woman he thought was his older sister was really his mother . Now that he 's 53 , other members of his family have popped up . The Canadian papers have unearthed TED RICH , once an up-and-coming Vancouver guitarist , now a heroin addict living in a flophouse . He and Clapton were both fathered by Edward Fryer , a Canadian soldier who met Clapton 's mother in Britain during the war . Rich also has a sister , living in Florida . Rich says he would like to meet his half brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got three songs I 've written that I 'd like to send him , to let him hear what his brother 's musical capabilities are , " Rich told the Montreal Gazette .

The singer 's representatives said they had no comment on his new family , but offered to fax through Clapton 's tour dates . <P> HIS LEFT FOOT <P> Climbing Mount Everest is no mean feat . Climbing Mount Everest with only one foot borders on lunacy . TOM WHITTAKER , a mountaineer who lost a kneecap and a foot in a car accident in 1979 , is in the Himalayas right now on his way to the top . No , he 's not hopping or being dragged up , although he is being carried financially by a vitamin company . He has a prosthesis , which has its advantages ( no chance of frostbite ) but takes 30% more energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Everest . He was turned back once by an avalanche and once because he decided he was too slow . " No , I do n't think I 'm insane , " says Whittaker , but adds this is his last summit attempt . And he 's keeping his climb in perspective . " One of the things that really attracts me about mountaineering is its total pointlessness , " he says . " So I 've dedicated my life to it .
