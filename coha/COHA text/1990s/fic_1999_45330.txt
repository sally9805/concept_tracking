I meant to say something about what happened after I discovered a miserable pile of stones twenty-five kilometers north of Vilnius . The stones mark the geographical center of Europe , a place not on my maps , though if you get around as much as I do you 'll find places like that .. . After departing this pile of stones , I took the bus back to Vilnius via the Moletai Highway , stopped at my flat on the Neris River , and intended to ring you up . I wanted to skip that pile of stones , tell you all about Wagner 's Overture to the Flying Dutchman , and ask you to come out with me to hear it . But when I got to my flat I was famished , and made myself all the hungrier watching from my window the crests of ashes and birches along the Neris River quivering in an easterly breeze , purple , red , orange , tannic tones fluting the bottom edge of a cloudless autumn sky ... <p> I soon found myself standing in the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what had been the cooperative 's cafeteria in Soviet times . I did n't want to be alone , though among so many diners I felt overwhelmed . I leaned a little right on the doorjamb and surveyed the room . Only two people sat by themselves , the first a man who seemed peaceful , waiting to be served . I envied him , then realized he must be lonely . A single strand of ratted hair hung in his eyes . It must have reminded him of his loneliness ; every now and again he rolled his eyes up , saw the shadow cast by that ratted hair , seemed to sigh , and I almost left straightaway to ring you and go out to hear the Dutchman-when suddenly a battalion of servers , all dressed in white , began to sweep through the aisles ; so I moved a little forward to get a look at what they were putting out for people , a roast of beef with vegetables and fruit pounded and baked inside : garlic cloves , carrots , onions , and prunes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far side of the Tulip I saw a pair of women , one speaking , the other listening ... I crossed the room , going right , by way of the aisle formed by the tables and wall , nudging a chair now and again carefully , quietly , steering as close to the wall as possible without drawing attention to myself by staying too close to it . For a time I stood in another doorjamb at the side entrance of the Tulip , watching this pair of women , their eyes intent on one another 's faces , some unseen hand seeming to hold back the ritual clanking of knives and forks and permitting them perfect conversation ! The speaker 's dark eyes slightly lifted as she spoke , words in her mouth framed by short raven-black hair ; every so often she 'd tap the side of her plate with the tip of a finger to punctuate a phrase . I realized then that it might be possible for me to listen in on their conversation and go unnoticed . <p> I went straight to their table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for the server to come . I closed my eyes , waiting for one or both of these women to suddenly react to my presence ... but they did n't . I even leaned a little forward to test the two women , to see how completely they were engaged with one another ; then I let a little air out of my chest , softly . <p> The server came with my food , slid my plate in front of me , and I almost flinched hearing the slight sound of its bottom rubbing the tablecloth . I put my eyes down , as if putting them down would erase the sound of the plate rubbing the cloth . I held my breath , then lifted one eye slightly and saw them still speaking . I gingerly lifted my fork and knife-both at precisely the same time-why use two actions when one would do ? - then realized , all the time hearing the speaker 's voice steady and unperturbed , that I was even hungrier than before , and for meat , glorious meat and not the usual grayish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cautiously into the meat with my fork , raise the knife slightly , then bring it down on the roast and begin to delicately saw , using only the pressure derived from the weight of the knife itself to cut my fruit-filled meat . Then and only then did I ever so surreptitiously turn my full attention to the teller and her story ... <p> This happened when my mother was a child , in Vilnius , during the war . I do n't really know how old my mother was in those days . You never get that sort of thing out of some parents . How many people really know their parents ? I mean , where they came from , what they cared about , all about things they did or felt when they were young and alone . All my mother said was that she was a child and she was an only child . I mean , there was a woman hidden in my mother 's flat , or so my mother believed because her parents had told her this woman was there , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she needed to sleep . My mother 's parents said to her , " Do n't worry about her . You must not ever tell anyone that this woman is in the wall . If you see her , you must never speak to her . If you do , something terrible will happen to all of us . " <p> My mother did not know in which wall or where in a particular wall this woman was hiding . She imagined the woman stood behind the wall with her ear to a water pipe so she could hear all the sounds in the building , then when the flat fell silent she 'd come out , use the toilet , eat a little , then go back into hiding . <p> Everyone knows the stories of those days ... My mother 's parents both worked , times were tough , and so my mother was left alone in the flat during the day . The landlady lived in the building , too , and she told my mother 's parents , " Do n't worry , I can check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , of course , knowing a woman was concealed in their wall , my mother 's parents were reluctant to allow this . But how could they not in those days ? The Nazi occupation . So my mother 's parents told the landlady that she could come up once a day in the late morning to check on my mother . <p> Things were normal at first . The landlady would come to the flat at the appointed hour . She was a portly lady who enjoyed fatty foods very much , was of course fat herself from enjoying them , and my mother told me that was fortunate for the woman in the wall because my mother imagined the woman could hear the landlady enter the flat , in fact could hear her coming long before she arrived , her thunderous footfalls , distinguishable from any other noise in the building . And because the landlady was so fond of fatty foods she 'd bring with her cepelinai and fried pork cutlets , which anyone could easily smell from a great distance , and which she shared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said , " Come , child , let me show you how to make your parents ' bed . " <p> The landlady had obviously determined that the bed regularly went unmade since my mother 's parents went off to their jobs quite early ; and so she took my mother by the hand into the bedroom , where the blankets on the bed were tossed-up and resembled a pachyderm . Attracted by such an odd shape , my mother began to approach the bed , when suddenly the landlady shoved her from behind with such force that she sailed over the footboard into the center of the bed and crushed the tossed-up pachyderm , flat . Instantly , my mother thought , " I 've crushed a pachyderm-how ? " <p> The landlady , who could not have known that the tossed-up shape in the bed was that of a pachyderm , said , " You 've flung yourself into your parents ' bed ! Why ? Is someone hiding in those sheets ? " <p> What I really wanted to tell you about was the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university to hear Wagner 's Dutchman . But it was that landlady 's push that drove me past the rest of the story of the woman in the wall and onto the two trolley going down Antakalnio . When I boarded the trolley I gave my seat to an old man who walked with a cane . The next stop , another elderly man got on and stood in front of me in the aisle . The old man with the cane suddenly reached out with his cane and slashed the elderly man on the calf with it . The older man turned back to look at me , thinking I 'd struck him , then saw the crippled man with the cane sitting and , after a long time shouting at him rapidly in Lithuanian , produced an umbrella , lunged past me , began to jab the crippled man in his stomach , who immediately repelled the attack by parrying with his cane , after which the man with the umbrella quickly refined his technique and started to thrust-and parry-when the man with the cane did the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . I let it happen . I almost laughed watching the two men locked in swordplay ! A woman with a basket of peas finally stopped the fray , batting the cane and umbrella away with her hands , saying to both men-and me- " Has sanity vanished from the face of the Earth ? You shame yourselves and the rest of us ! " <p> After I got off the trolley , I walked to Vokieciu gatve to find a phone booth to call you . Somehow I felt drawn to you given your description by our mutual friend , Erika , who 'd given me your telephone number and assured me she 'd put me in good stead . Has Erika spoken to you ? No matter . Somehow , though you hardly knew me , I thought you might save my day , say , perhaps , " But you must n't blame yourself for those two old men fighting . It is more common than you think . Perhaps they were enemies from long ago , in the ice age , Soviet times . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to be alone . And there was no one in the plaza of Vokieciu , something someone especially notices when they want to be left alone , like a bitter little miracle . The sky was vacant and blue , no wind whatsoever . The butt of the receiver felt heavy in my palm , nothing else , a single sensation . When you answered my call , I said , laughing , " Erika gave me your number . I have two tickets for the Flying Dutchman ... Do n't stand me up . " <p> You replied quickly , " Let me go . " <p> " Do you mean , " I replied slowly , " let me go ' as in ' I need to get off the telephone now ' or Let me go ' as in Let me go-forever ' ? " But there was a rattling silence on the line , so I quickly added , " I 'm harmless , believe me ... All right , forget about my asking you to go with me to the Flying Dutchman . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange occurrence on the two trolley-a fight ! At least let me explain . " <p> " Let me go , " you said again . <p> " But why be so dramatic ? " I replied . " I 'm closer than you think ! I 'm just at the telephone booth on Vokieciu . Do n't stand me up ! " I insisted . <p> " Let me go , " you said . <p> My mother never told her parents about the landlady 's shoving her into their bedclothes . You know how a child feels ashamed about things , any little thing sometimes , the way the innocent sometimes bear evil away with them . So the landlady kept visiting my mother in the flat with the woman hidden in the wall . One day , she said to my mother , " Now we are going to play a game . " Then she tugged my mother by her arm outside the flat and into the hallway . " Stand here , " the landlady added , then walked to the doors of three flats on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The landlady left each door swinging free , slightly ajar . When she finished unlocking the doors to the three other flats she returned to my mother . " I want you to hide in one of those three flats and I 'll come and try to find you . I 'll close my eyes now . You have only three minutes to hide-now , go ! " <p> The landlady covered her eyes and my mother darted off and ran in and out of the first flat , and when she went into the second flat and ran into the bedroom , she saw a woman draped in a long black shawl coming out of the closet ! The woman started toward my mother , who backed away in surprise . <p> " Do n't be afraid , " the woman said sweetly to my mother . Then the woman smiled , or as mother recalls it , tried to smile , the way the spirit smiles but the face resists and will not permit the muscles to move freely . The woman held her hand out to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women hiding in the walls of two flats of the building , turned and raced out of the flat and into the hallway , hearing behind only a remnant of the woman 's final words , " Please . " <p> To my mother 's surprise the landlady was not in the hall or searching any of the flats whose doors she 'd so ceremoniously opened . Instead , my mother could hear the landlady 's thunderous footfalls in her parents ' flat , and when she went inside the landlady was rounding the corner , coming out of my mother 's bedroom . <p> " I thought I told you to hide in one of the other flats , " the landlady said . <p> My mother had felt ashamed when the landlady had pushed her into the tossed-up bedclothes ; and now she felt ashamed having met the woman coming out of the closet , and so she lied about having seen her . <p> " You are looking in the wrong place ! " my mother said to the landlady , nearly in tears . " You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : though I scarcely knew you , I 'd hated letting you go , hanging up that receiver and pushing off for the university alone . But when I found the iron gate of the courtyard of Saint Jonas 's Cathedral at the university , what a splendid sight greeted me ! At last ! I thought . Hohoje ! Hohoje ! Halloho ! Ho ! - through the iron bars I could see the city orchestra , all its members in tuxedos and tails , feverishly playing the Flying Dutchman . In the full and clear light of the evening sun , their trembling instruments made slender , crisp , exquisite shadows that vibrated on the cobblestones . I entered the courtyard , at last full of hope and anticipation after what had been a day of setbacks , ready to drink the music until I 'd become intoxicated and unafraid . Yet just as I passed through the iron gate the Dutchman 's last note sounded-an eerie reflection off the medieval walls of the courtyard-so near my long-awaited goal , and Fate had reserved the last blow ! The audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could do nothing but stand there the whole time , until the last soul in the courtyard , a cellist , walked past me at the iron gate , his cello case wobbling in front of him . He looked like a pregnant woman . I almost laughed . In my bad Lithuanian I said to him , " I only heard your last note ! " <p> The cellist laughed and stared at me , but not straight at me ; he looked past me to a point on the ancient and fractured wall of the courtyard where that last note of the Dutchman had resounded . And when the cellist went through the iron gate , I was alone , and in that condition was reminded that this cellist 's stare was perhaps what I 'd wanted all along , why I 'd wanted to hear the Dutchman in the first place , a little game I like to play : I sit close to the musicians ; make eye contact with one of them ; try to toss the musician off a beat or two ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stare in my general direction , beyond me-while the music , unperturbed , rises around me , drowns my senses , and I 've no choice but to listen and listen while the musician 's grim gaze goes past me , back to that same spot on the same wall again and again and again ... <p> After the game of searching the three flats on my mother 's floor , the landlady did not come around for two days . But the next time she came to check on my mother , she entered very quietly , no thunderous footfalls ; she was grinning ear to ear , seemed very self-satisfied , grinned so long my mother could not help but grin herself . The landlady pointed to the sitting room . <p> " Let 's go in there , " the landlady whispered . " We 're going to play another game . " She sat on the couch and removed some cookies from a paper bag . She handed one to my mother , who eagerly ate it . " Here , " she went on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bright white and thoroughly perfumed . The scent nearly made my mother faint , but remembering the cookies , my mother put her back straight and listened as the landlady continued , " I 'll tie this over your eyes . Then I am going to place your hand in some things . I want you to tell me what these things feel like . If you are correct , I will give you another cookie . " <p> " All right ! " my mother replied , and the landlady tied the perfumed handkerchief over her eyes . <p> First , the landlady took my mother by her hand , guided her to a potted plant , and pushed her fingers into the soil . " Earth , " my mother said , snuffling from the perfume in the handkerchief . <p> " Correct , " the landlady replied , " and here 's your cookie . " Next , the landlady walked my blindfolded mother to a small bowl with water inside . <p> " Water , " she replied and received her cookie . <p> Next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand a few centimeters above the flame . <p> " Fire , " my mother whispered , full of breath , wonder and a little anger . She wrenched her hand from the landlady 's cold , fat fingers , and tore the blindfold from her eyes . <p> " I did n't hear you , " the landlady whispered . Then she said , loudly , " What ? What is it ! " <p> " Fire ! " my mother said , loudly as well , and angrier still . " I told you ! Fire ! " <p> The storyteller lowered her eyes ; her gaze fell to the table ; her face grew dark and she looked at her hands then looked back to her devoted listener . " Well , " the storyteller said , and she paused . <p> I wondered : what heat , what fear or courage could have caused this woman to stay inside her wall when the shouts of this child spelled almost certain death ? <p> My mouth was open . I knew it . My tongue was dry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air seemed to rush out of me . Suddenly the storyteller 's eyes darted right-to me-then to my plateshe seemed astonished that I had seated myself , been served , and begun to eat , all in the time she 'd told her story and that she 'd not noticed any of it . She discovered me ! She smiled grimly , forming a flat line with her lips , turned ever so slightly at the corners . All I could think was that this was not what I had started out to do . I was off to attend a concert , Wagner 's Dutchman . And I was going to tell you about that , only that , and now this ? I could n't help myself . I waited a very short while for her grim smile to change , but her every feature seemed frozen . <p> " What do you mean ' Well ' ? " I said to her . " Did she come out of that wall or not ? " I paused , trying to gain my composure , but no luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I looked at her coldly-and I flew . I left my food-I left everything ... <p> All this is a long way around telling you I understand why you wo n't come out with me . I understand your horror as clearly as I understand my own . It goes all the way back to the woman in the wall , whether one allows cruelty to hold sway in the world or not-or to travel , by which I mean I encountered the strangest man today ... After hearing the last note of the Dutchman come off the wall of the courtyard of Saint Jonas 's at the university , I headed back to Vokieciu to ring you again , which I did , but got no answer , and soon found myself sitting on the steps of the Vilnius Museum of Art , swinging my legs over the wall supporting the steps , my back to the museum , which by that time of day was closed , locked tight . I liked feeling the weight of the concrete building looming behind me . No surprises . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moskvich , motor running , the driver sitting on the hood , smoking , swinging his legs back and forth . I began to synchronize the swinging of my legs with his , back , forth ; but when I was sure I 'd found the point at which our two sets of swinging legs were synchronized , the taxi driver abruptly changed his rhythm and threw me out of synch . So caught up in my little game with the taxi diver , swinging our legs like that , the old man seemed to come out of nowhere , suddenly sailing slowly up the steps of the museum toward me . By now , the sun was low in the western sky , so his shadow preceded him . His eyes were wide and shot through , blood-red , and with a white handkerchief he was wiping sweat dappling his forehead . He stopped one step below mine , his back leg on the step before that one . He looked up at me . <p> " American ? " he said , out of breath . <p> " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've asked myself a thousand times . Was I really so transparent ? ) <p> " I am retired , you know , " he went on . " I am French . " He folded his handkerchief , reached back , and pushed it into his hip pocket . " I am a professor of history , you know . This place is so full of history . " <p> " Standing room only , " I said . " Center of Europe . " <p> He nodded at the Art Museum behind us . " Closed ? " he said . <p> " Closed , " I said . <p> " Time to find another ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Are you sure ? " <p> " It 's too late , " I said . " Everything 's closed and I 'm moving on . Next thing , I 'm grabbing that taxi over there . " <p> He looked a little puzzled at my remark , then shrugged and looked all around himself , skyward , sighing , tired . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in the wall . But then the lids of his eyes suddenly fell and I thought he might expire on the steps . All I could think is that I could n't have him dropping there in front of me . Not after all I 'd been through . <p> " By the way , " he said at last , " the geographical center of Europe . Have you found it ? " <p> " No , " I said . <p> " It 's a pity , " he said . <p> " No , it is n't , " I replied . " Get away from me , " I added . " Leave me alone . " <p>
