<p> Richard Worland will probably have to go to England to get the latest , most effective shoulder implant device to treat his arthritis . <p> The implant is approved and widely used in Europe , Latin America and Australia , but not in the USA . <p> Ironically , Worland is its inventor . <p> " It will be at least three more years before patients in America can benefit from the device , " says Worland , an orthopedic surgeon in Richmond , Va . " I myself need the operation and I ca n't get it here . This is pathetic . " <p> Because of speedier approvals in other countries , frustration over the lengthy process required by the Food and Drug Administration , and payment issues involving Medicare , the USA is losing its cutting edge in high-tech medical devices to Europe . <p> As a result , people in other countries are increasingly the first to benefit from U.S. innovation . <p> A new , unpublished survey conducted by the Health Industry Manufacturers Association , which represents more than 700 medical device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are required to go through clinical trials . Such devices include pacemakers , joint implants and cardiac catheters . In the last 10 months : <p>  --  50% of companies have already moved some clinical trials of devices offshore . <p>  --  56% are limiting existing device studies in the USA to non-Medicare patients . <p>  --  75% plan to move their device trials to Europe . <p> Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis has trials in Europe of spinal cord stimulators for chronic pain and devices to control tremors in Parkinson 's disease  --  but not in the USA . <p> HIMA says if trends do n't change , innovation wo n't be coming back . <p> " In Europe and other countries , products are being brought to market more swiftly and with fewer barriers , and I 'm afraid ultimately we 'll lose our leadership in devices , " says Jim Benson , assocation vice president who is also a former FDA acting commissioner . <p> About three years ago , the FDA began requiring more stringent patient studies of so-called " substantial risk " devices before they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the 1980s , but a massive internal audit of the device division , called the Temple Report after FDA official Robert Temple , concluded that rules were too lax . <p> Some experts likened the earlier regulations to " fifth-grade science . " <p> Manufacturers and inventors like Worland became increasingly frustrated with the tighter rules and delays in approvals . In 1994 , FDA took 823 days to approve substantial risk devices vs. 250 days in Europe . <p> " I understand we need to protect patients from potentially harmful devices , " Worland says . " But why does it have to take so long ? " <p> Worland says he waited four years after developing the " bipolar shoulder implant " to get FDA permission for a study . By then , the manufacturer already had approval in Spain , the United Kingdom , Denmark , Sweden , Switzerland , Japan , Australia , Brazil , Mexico and Germany . <p> In general , regulatory agencies in other countries require less rigorous clinical data and permit more risk up front in patients than the FDA . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients there get the benefits first . <p> The tradeoff : When devices are defective , patients in other countries will be the first to suffer . <p> For example , a " 70-degree " Bjork-Shiley heart valve that was approved in Europe , but not in the USA , was later associated with a 50% increased death rate due to fractures in the valve . <p> " While most people believe that using the most advanced device is best , the data are n't in yet , " says Dr. Greg Koski , who oversees clinical studies at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . " You could take the position that restricting access limits exposure to a device that might be less effective . " <p> Nevertheless , last summer the conflict over device studies and the exodus of innovation hit a flashpoint . <p> After years of billing Medicare for costs of investigational device studies , hospitals found themselves under investigation for Medicare fraud . <p> Medicare rules exclude unapproved devices from reimbursement , but hospitals have always billed for their costs and Medicare has always paid . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General issued subpoenas to more than 130 of the nation 's leading medical centers requesting nearly a decade 's worth of billing records on cardiac devices . <p> Susan Waltman , general counsel for the Greater New York Hospital Association , says hospitals did not believe they were doing anything wrong and were shocked at the allegations of fraud . <p> But the Health Care Financing Administration , which administers Medicare , says hospitals should have known better . <p> " We have had a policy all along under which we did n't reimburse for investigational devices , " says spokesman Tom Hoyer . " The inspector general had uncovered cases in which people were inappropriately billing Medicare . The issue goes back to the beginning of the Medicare program . <p> " It is analogous to people speeding down the highway at 70 miles an hour and suddenly seeing a highway patrol pull behind . But the speed limit has always been 55 . " <p> Faced with possible federal charges and potentially millions of dollars in fines , hospitals slammed on the brakes - either shutting down all device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals have canceled all studies , including those on drugs . <p> " The bottom line is many of the hospitals have substantially changed the way they are conducting clinical trials , " says Waltman . <p> The subpoenas created a domino effect  --  hospitals closed studies , limiting access to devices by Medicare patients . Doctors were no longer able to provide what they considered the latest treatments to many older patients . And some companies said , " Enough . " <p> Medtronic has made more than half the world 's pacemakers . Most of its new products for the last five years have been available first in Europe . Last November , it moved its research and development division to the Netherlands . It probably will never be back . <p> " No question that both the slow regulatory process and restrictions on the reimbursement for investigational devices have had a chilling effect on medical innovation in the U.S. , " says Medtronic 's Paul Citron . <p> Until the investigation is concluded and hospitals learn whether they 'll be prosecuted , clinical studies of investigational devices involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting down toward the end of looking at all of the records we subpoenaed and should have all data gone through in the next month to two months , " says inspector general spokeswoman Judy Holtz . <p> While hospitals cry foul and cancel device studies , and doctors complain they ca n't deliver " state of the art " treatment to patients , the IG does have evidence that at least some doctors at some institutions have cheated . <p> The issue that appears to be behind the subpoenas is a violation of FDA rules called commercialization . <p> FDA device branch chief Bruce Burlington says companies are permitted to recoup development costs but not to make a profit from investigational devices . <p> During a study of an investigational device , doctors and hospitals are expected to follow strict protocols . The number of patients who can receive an unapproved device is tightly controlled and patients are supposed to receive devices only in the setting of a study . <p> The concern is doctors decide before a study is completed that a device is superior to the approved product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . " <p> Doctors begin implanting it in all their patients , and Medicare is billed . But Medicare considers " state of the art " to mean FDA approved . <p> How widespread commercialization of investigational devices is may come out in the IG investigation . <p> Doctors like Worland , device makers and HIMA 's Benson argue that less regulation should be placed on devices that are so-called " next generation . " These are devices most often involved in commercialization . Such devices may have only minor modifications and ought not have to go through clinical trials , they argue . <p> Burlington says the agency is speeding up approvals and working more closely with companies to get products though the pipeline . But he says clinical studies are needed to prove what works and what does n't . <p> He cites a modified hip implant  --  a second-generation device  --  that crumbled after it was implanted and was found during clinical trials to be worse than its predecessor . <p> Consumer advocate Sidney Wolfe , of Public Citizen Health Research , is normally one of FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first to learn of faulty devices . In this case , he agrees with Burlington . <p> " I get tired of hearing the phrase ' state of the art ' as a buzz word for ' trust us , but we do n't have the evidence . ' It 's why we have regulations , " says Wolfe . " Over and over again devices have to be recalled because they 're defective and Medicare has to foot the bill for the negligence . It 's an outrageous issue with tens , if not hundreds , of millions of bucks down the tube . " <p> In the end , the preservation of medical device innovation in the USA boils down to two points : <p>  --  How much risk is the patient willing to accept to maintain access to new devices ? <p>  --  Who should pay for their development ? <p> While the questions are being debated , the clock is ticking . <p> " Clinical trials of medical devices are an endangered species , " says attorney Steven Speil , of the manufacturers association . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinct you wo n't get them back . " <p> Getting FDA approval for new device lengthy process Orthopedic surgeon Richard Worland in 1990 designed a new " bipolar " total shoulder implant for people whose joints have been destroyed by rheumatoid arthritis . <p> His design , he says , overcomes problems of wear and dislocation found frequently with the existing model . <p> His journey to seek FDA approval will take at least seven years . Meanwhile the device is already approved and used successfully worldwide . <p> A timeline : <p>  --  July 1991 . Worland files first application with FDA for market approval . The application , called a 510K , asserts the device is substantially similar in design to a bipolar hip implant used since the 1970s and includes no new materials . If granted , no clinical trials will be required . <p>  --  May 5 , 1992 . Gets a response from the FDA rejecting the 510K application . <p>  --  June 23 , 1992 . Files first Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) to do a clinical trial . The FDA required Worland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time . Worland goes back to the drawing board . <p>  --  March 10 , 1993 . Worland submits a second IDE . <p>  --  February 1994 . Worland submits a second 510K with more clinical data . <p>  --  November 1994 . Second IDE is conditionally approved and 510K is rejected . His study is expected to take three years to obtain device approval . <p> The average time for approval of his device in other countries was one to two months . No clinical trials were required . <p> Process depends on device 's risk There are two basic types of devices : <p> Significant risk devices generally require a surgical procedure  --  pacemakers and joint implants , for example . These devices must be proven safe and effective in laboratory testing before they can be tested in humans . <p> Test results are submitted for an Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) . Reviewers examine laboratory data , determine how the study will done , who the patients are , whether the methods will achieve the stated goals , whether the study is ethical and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria are met , the FDA grants the IDE and trials can begin . <p> If an investigational significant risk device is proven to be substantially similar to an existing device , however , an approval know as a " 510K " may be obtained and no clinical studies are required . <p> Non-significant risk devices , such as blood-pressure cuffs , are those that pose no more risk to a person 's health or safety than that encountered in day-to-day life . No trials are needed .
