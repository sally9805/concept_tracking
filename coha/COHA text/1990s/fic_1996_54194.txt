ONCE UPON A TIME THERE lived an emperor who loved his people very much . Because he ruled with wisdom , responsibility and compassion , he was much loved in return . <p> One bright spring day , a pair of tailors came to the palace . To celebrate the emperor 's birthday , they would make him the finest and most beautiful suit of clothes that had ever been made . <p> The emperor was no fool . He knew that there are no absolutes in the material universe  --  especially when it comes to such subjective things as the individual perception of artistic achievement . And he said so to the traveling tailors . " There are no absolutes . " <p> " You are absolutely right , " agreed the tailors . " If there is even one person in the world who does not see that this is truly the very finest and most beautiful suit of clothes possible , then we will have failed completely . This is quite a problem , yes , but we have solved it , we are certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Go on , " he bade them . <p> " We are going to make your suit of clothes out of a cloth so dazzling and radiant that just to look at it will blind you . Naturally , this would be impractical to wear , so we have made the cloth invisible as well . " <p> The emperor nodded thoughtfully . " That makes good sense . " <p> And then the traveling tailors said , " The name of this cloth is imagination , Your Majesty . " And they unrolled the cloth before him , suggesting that he close his eyes , the better to see it clearly . <p> And truly , the emperor saw in the space between his eyes and his eyelids a cloth so much finer than any cloth that possibly could have been woven , so sheer of texture that silk was put to shame , so intricate of design , so radiant of color , so perfectly stitched and embroidered , that he was struck speechless with wonder . He had not realized he could envision such finery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever made could exist only in the minds of the beholders . To even attempt to accomplish it in fact would be to lessen the concept of the absolute with corporeal details . <p> " Do you understand , Your Majesty ? If you were to wear a suit of imagination , you would be wearing the finest suit of clothing ever made . " <p> The emperor was not a particularly vain man , but even so , he could not help thinking of how the marvelous suit of imaginary cloth would look in a parade . Nevertheless , remembering his subjects and the royal treasury and his commitment to rule wisely and responsibly , he asked , " How much will it cost ? " <p> " Ah , that is the very best part of all , Your Majesty . The cloth of imagination costs nothing at all . " <p> The emperor was delighted . " Now this truly is a wonder that I must share with my people . I accept your offer . You may make me a marvelous garment of imagination and I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy it . " <p> On the day that the emperor was to march , every citizen in the kingdom lined the streets of the capital city ; they had all come to see the wondrous wonder that cost absolutely nothing at all . But there was one little boy who had not heard the news , or maybe he did n't realize that what he was supposed to see was something that could not be seen , so he said in a voice so thin and high and piping that it could be heard all over the town square , " Gosh , Dad  --  look ! The emperor is bloody starkers ! " <p> The lad 's father , embarrassed , tried to explain to him that this was an imaginary suit , but the child refused to understand . " The emperor is naked ! " he insisted . " He 's got no clothes at all . " And all the people heard , and looked , and saw indeed that the emperor was naked , and they were embarrassed  --  embarrassed for the child 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had no sense of wonder . And in this kingdom the people had a special word to describe those without the sense to wonder ; they were called fools . How sad for the poor father . <p> Only a fool could fail to realize that an emperor never stands naked in front of his subjects without good reason . Even naked , the emperor still wore the finest suit of clothes ever made : the suit that God had given him the day that he was born . And nothing more , no additional adornment could be added to it that would make it any prettier . If anything , adornment would only detract from the majesty of God 's creation . <p> And for those who wanted and needed to see dazzling raiment , the emperor wore the cloth of imagination , a cloth that costs nothing at all and is free to everyone ; they need only close their eyes to see a glorious suit of clothes finer than any that the human hand could make . <p> All the people loved and honored the emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without hypocrisy , without pretense , and for respecting the people enough to recognize that each one had his own special vision of the best , needing only a bit of wonder to exercise that vision . He was a very fine emperor indeed . <p> And the little boy ? Well , yes , he really was a fool , for not realizing the beauty of the human body , nor the wonder of the human imagination . He was taken to a home for the bewildered and stuffed full of honey-bread and jam and then tickled till he giggled in delight , because what else can you do with a fool ? <p> <p> By David Gerrold <p> David Gerrold 's most recent appearance was " The Martian Child " in the September 1994 issue .
