Growing up in eastern Tennessee , Alice Wilkinson liked nothing better than listening to her grandmother talk about the family 's past . Little did she imagine that this childhood fascination would lead to a 17-year quest for her roots and the discovery that she is related to Revolutionary War soldiers as well as fighters on both sides in the Civil War , and that she shares ancestors with former pro quarterback Terry Bradshaw , Senator Strom Thurmond and Elvis Presley .

The Denver Public Library takes pride in its wealth of Hispanic genealogical material , and , says director James Jeffrey , " because of our Western History Collection , we have a lot of information about Asians who migrated to Hawaii and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources .

" Masses of material can be organized more efficiently with software programs such as Family Tree Maker , the Master Genealogist , Ultimate Family Tree , Family Origins and Personal Ancestral File .
