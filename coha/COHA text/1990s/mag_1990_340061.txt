In many ways , senior citizens would seem to be perfect candidates for home computing . They have time on their hands and minds that tend to race ahead of their aging bodies . With a computer and telephone hookup , an elderly user who has trouble getting around can visit a library , buy a security , post a letter or run a small business without ever leaving home . But older Americans have been among the most reluctant computer users , according to industry surveys . While some 20% of all U.S. households have home computers , only 9% of adults age 60 to 69 own them  --  a figure that drops to 3% for those 70 and older . <P> That is beginning to change . Across the U.S. , thousands of aging Americans are happily tapping away at keyboards and trading floppy disks , thanks to a new wave of computer-literacy programs designed with the elderly user in mind . The largest of these is SeniorNet , the first national organization dedicated to bringing senior citizens into the information age . Since it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nonprofit organization has trained nearly 4,000 of the elderly at 26 sites in the U.S. and Canada , including doctors ' offices , retirement homes , senior centers , high schools and colleges . " We 're evangelists for the idea that older adults are very capable users of computers , " says Executive Director Mary Furlong , an associate professor of education at U.S.F. and co-author of a book titled Computers for Kids over Sixty . <P> For a $25 initiation fee , SeniorNet members receive a two-month , hands-on training course and a quarterly newsletter . Hundreds have hooked up to SeniorNet 's computer network , which costs $6.90 per hour of use during evenings and on weekends . To seniors in isolated areas , the price seems cheap for the ability to communicate with people their own age through electronic mail , bulletin boards and computer forums on topics ranging from gardening to health-care legislation . " It 's their window on the world , " says Cindy Schwehr , SeniorNet coordinator at the Sheyenne Care Center in Valley City , N. Dak . " The residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get any E-mail ? ' " <P> Mabel Osborne , 85 , had spent two years sick in bed when she read about a SeniorNet class in Dallas . She signed up and made an important discovery . " I was n't sick , " she says . " I was just bored to death . " Osborne quickly mastered basic computer skills and went on to study word processing at a local community college . " She bought a word processor and is now writing the history of her life , " says Florence Wetzig , 69 , a former beauty-salon operator who taught Osborne how to compute . " She has said to me many times that I saved her life . " <P> For Seattle 's E.B. ( " Jiggs " ) Clark , 72 , the impetus to become computer literate came from a seven-year-old boy he saw hacking away at a desktop machine in a computer store . " I asked , ' How did you learn how to work it ? ' He turned to me and said , ' What are you , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left behind , Clark acquired an Apple IIc and plunged into the world of telecommunications . Now he uses his computer and modem to stay in touch with similarly equipped seniors all over the U.S. Says he : " If I 'm immobilized , if I 'm in a hospital , if I 'm in a condition where I 'm confined , I 've got my world right in front of me.
