<p> The key thing to remember on a Disney cruise ? Smile . Smile when Minnie Mouse rushes up to welcome you on board . ( She wo n't say a word , of course . ) Smile at the chipper hordes who guide you and your Disney Magic " Key to the World " through the Mouse-ear portal and onto the ship . Smile at breakfast , lunch , dinner - when swimming in the Goofy-embossed pool or spending time in the hangout designed especially for teens . This is a happy experience . Actually , it is . Disney 's launch into the growing family-cruise market looks like a winning combination of adult/teen fun and kiddie entertainment , of ubiquitous Disney insignia and cruise-ship elegance . It even offers something I 've never experienced at the Magic Kingdom : time to relax . Relaxation , of course , is in the eye of the beholder . A few uninterrupted hours in a lounge chair by one of the three pools looks pretty good to me . To my fifth-grader , Harlan , nonstop trips down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would answer the siren call of the video arcade at 3 a.m. if I let him . Therein lies the magic - which , by the way , is the name of the ship . Its 10 decks , numerous nightclubs , pools for all age groups , and children 's entertainment centers were assembled in Italy with everyone in mind . Not only is there a wide variety of entertainment , but the staff will make sure you 're happy and you know it while you partake . We were indeed quite happy during our time on board . It is exciting , for starters , to glance up collectively at a 964-foot ship and anticipate the pampered experience lying ahead ( especially after the one-hour drive from the Disney resort ) . The ship , which debuted in July and is the first of two Disney vessels , evokes days gone by with its art deco flourishes , sleek hull , and two red smokestacks ( even if a 15-foot Goofy is hanging off the back ) . Walking into the ship 's three-story lobby is sure to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease when they spot the bronze nautical Mickey watching over everything . The cabins are large enough to allow for some elbow room , although the ones to target are the rooms with a view ( 73 percent of the rooms on board , many with verandas ) . Then all you have to figure out is what to do first . As with all things Disney , the attention to detail is a main selling point . My children clued into this within the first hour , after two or three helpful staff members breezed up to ask us if we 'd like something to drink . Requests for soda were met with gentle suggestions that fruit slushes would be far more appealing . As it turned out , they were , and the kids snapped up quite a few over the duration of the cruise - and in the process , became alarmingly at ease with " just ask , and it 's yours " - french fries , some ice cream , help at the video arcade , help with shuffleboard , and more , more , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruise , though rest assured , adults hardly get neglected ( more on that later ) . Nearly an entire deck , in addition to the children 's pools and meeting areas , is given over to keeping younger vacationers happy . The Oceaneer Club , for children ages 3 to 8 , offers a fun play space with all sorts of climbing structures . The Oceaneer Lab appeals to nine- to 12-year-olds with its computers , giant video walls , and a variety of games . A small army of counselors who hail from a wide variety of countries are on hand to help and are relentlessly friendly and helpful . They 'll take your child any time from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. the following morning . They 'll sign him or her in and hand you a beeper , lest you be tempted to lie a little too low . Many of the kids on the cruise lapped up the organized entertainment . On our particular cruise , the facilities were n't that crowded , giving all kids a chance to tap away at the computers and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an almost full house , something parents planning to head off for any length of time might want to keep in mind . <p> Not just a kid 's world When the younger crowd does disappear , adults have plenty of ways to remind them that it 's not just a kids ' world , after all . There is a spa and salon , an adults-only pool , and an ESPN sky box at the top of the ship , where you can watch the game and get a great view . Entertainment spots include the Rockin'Bar D , the Off Beat comedy club , and Studio Sea , with game shows and cabaret acts . Families can reunite over dinner at one of the three restaurants , all of which you can sample during the course of the cruise . Our favorite was Animator 's Palate , where the room starts out black and white but gradually comes alive with color . By the end of the meal , you 're surrounded by Disney characters lighting up the walls in warm blues , oranges , and yellows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vests for a livelier look . The entertainment value of the meal was important , as it turned out , because none of us much cared for the food . Breakfast and lunch were fine , but the more gourmet evening meals yielded such things as dry fish and bland desserts . It was a sentiment shared by many of our dining companions , and something that unfortunately drove my kids more regularly in the direction of the fast-food options near the pool . The best food reviews came from Palo , the adults-only restaurant that takes reservations . A high point for us was Castaway Cay , Disney 's beach . This is where it sinks in that the company is really trying to do something different . The beach was distinctly Disneyesque , with seashells that looked as if they were carefully placed each night ( we were exhorted not to take any ) , neat lines of chairs and colorful umbrellas , bicycle and stroller rentals , and a few tasteful concessions . But it was remarkably simple . We did go snorkeling through Disney 's " lagoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per adult and $ 19.50 per child , per day ) , but most of the time we paddled around in the crystal-clear water on our floats . The island has an adults-only beach , but on the day we were there , most people were voting in favor of the all-ages facility . <p> Watch out for the added costs So was the experience the Magic Kingdom on water ? Not really . For one thing , Disney still had a few kinks to iron out , particularly with the " keys , " plastic cards that malfunctioned regularly as we tried to use them to open the room , open the room safe , get onto the ship , and charge purchases . The seamless operation evident at the resorts was not quite on board yet , something that dismayed a few passengers who hold Disney to extremely high standards . For another , the prices on ship bordered on the outrageous . Much of your cost is indeed covered in a single fee ( see story , left ) , but there are plenty of ways to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pricey ( a Disney polo shirt costs $ 53 ) , and you may want to be careful about how much freedom you give the kids in the video arcade . My children and I wondered if hopping on a Disney ship after spending three or four days at the resort ( something we did not do ) would be overkill . We concluded that the cruise is a separate experience . Adults who came without children could find plenty of quiet and plenty to entertain them , although the much-touted " Broadway-style " shows could be described as tame bordering on the saccharin . But everything was fun . There 's plenty of room for enjoying yourself on this ship , although it 's probably best to be a big Disney fan . Then you 'll really be happy . <p> IF YOU GO * Prices : Seven-day vacation ( three- to four-days at Disney Resort , airfare from 150 cities , three- to four-day cruise ) : $ 1,295-4,225 per person , double occupancy .
