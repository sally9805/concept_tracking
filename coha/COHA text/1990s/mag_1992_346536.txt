Like a once great slugger emerging from a long slump , George Bush finally pushed one over the bleachers last week . After 10 months of maneuvering to little effect on the recession , the Los Angeles riots and the Rio Earth Summit , Bush won from Boris Yeltsin a breakthrough arms-control deal and engineered the horseshoe-throwing , arm-around-Barbara scenes that remind people of his other up-close-and-personal diplomatic triumphs . <P> Nonetheless , it is doubtful that the first Russian-American summit did Bush much good . He is in such poor political shape that Yeltsin , world peace and a cure for the common cold might not revive him . The public 's regard for the dithering President has sunk to all-time lows : more than 50% of those + questioned in a recent survey disapprove of his handling of his job . " Bush had a pretty good substantive week , " said a campaign official last Friday , " but the sad thing is that what we do has very little effect on folks . He 's had such a bad spell for so long that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything right . By now , when George Bush talks , a lot of people just turn down the volume . " <P> Bush 's shrinking presidency is , oddly enough , partly the result of his re- election strategy . Since late last year , Bush has seen his campaign through the prism of 1988 , when he ignored his advisers ' pleas and waited until August before casting off the constraints of the vice presidency and posing as a moderate who had chafed under Ronald Reagan 's conservative shackles . Bush , who likes to lower expectations and then surprise everyone by beating the depressed odds , again wants to wait until the Republican Convention in August to redefine himself . Bush expected that just as in 1988 , he would slip behind in polls and then , when pundits had nearly written him off , he would come back with a boffo convention speech and a blitzkrieg campaign . In the meantime , he would direct his army of surrogates to shoulder the unpleasant job of " defining " Ross Perot and Bill Clinton . <P> At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy political lifting , arousing the G.O.P. faithful by labeling Perot a " temperamental tycoon " and attacking totems of the " cultural elite , " from Murphy Brown to Time Warner and its rap recording artist Ice-T , as out of touch with family values . Bush likes to pretend he finds such negative tactics distasteful . When encouraged to comment on his sidekick 's speeches , Bush is careful to distance himself with such lines as , " You better ask Mr. Quayle . " But the Vice President is n't free-lancing ; Bush campaign chairman Bob Teeter personally approved Quayle 's characterization of Perot . As a Quayle staffer puts it , " Bush 's genius is that he 's always kept people around him to do his dirty work . "
