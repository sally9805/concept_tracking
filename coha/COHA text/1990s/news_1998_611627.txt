<p> Find a sympathetic doctor these days and head down to the corner drugstore with a few prescriptions in hand , and you can walk out with a sack of goodies that promise to make life better . <p> There 's Propecia , a $ 50-a-month treatment to make a balding man 's hair grow back . There 's a prescription cream called Retin-A to make wrinkles fade . There 's Prozac for positive thinking and a new drug that can make folks thinner . <p> And now , of course , there is Viagra , an impotence treatment that some urologists believe will make sex better even for men who are n't impotent . For that matter , it may make sex better for women who take it . <p> This is the new frontier of drug development , quality-of-life pharmacology . The products on the market now are merely the first wave . In the laboratories of the nation 's drug and biotechnology companies , a dazzling array of new treatments are under development . <p> Taking advantage of growing knowledge of the body 's elementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to restore joints damaged by arthritis , lower the body 's " set point " to banish flab , grow new blood vessels to replace ones that clog up , stop age-related degeneration of the eyes and bones . In short , they hope to keep people looking and feeling vigorous well into the decades that used to be regarded as old age . <p> Among scientists there is n't much question that a lot of this will happen  --  the only real question is how soon . <p> " Where all this technology is taking us is into a series of qualitative improvements in people 's lives , " said William Haseltine , head of Human Genomes Sciences Inc. of Rockville , a company in the vanguard of the new pharmacology . " We 'll be using our knowledge to help the body rebuild itself . " <p> Yet this push for quality-of-life drugs raises vexing new questions for the nation 's health-care system . Foremost is the issue of cost . Drug and biotech companies are investing billions to develop the new treatments , in part because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The nation 's insurers and large private employers already are deeply worried about the potential cost of these drugs . While overall health-care inflation has been brought under control by the advent of managed care , some big insurance plans have been reporting double-digit increases in the last couple of years in prescription costs . <p> Insurers fear that a few more expensive drugs like Viagra could help to reignite health-care inflation . <p> Certainly there 's no question that the public wants the drugs . As the nation 's pharmacopeia expands over the next decade , it will find a prime market in the baby-boom generation , the 76 million Americans born from 1946 to 1964 . The youngest of the baby boomers are turning 34 this year and the oldest are turning 52 . These are precisely the years when people first begin to rue the indignities of advancing age . <p> Many of the baby boomers were teenagers and young adults in the 1960s and so are often familiar with the idea that life can be improved with drugs . They are , moreover , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to roll over just because insurance companies do n't want to pay for things . To this market , drug and biotech companies hope to introduce a whole slew of new compounds over the next few years that help to slow down the ravages of age . <p> There 's nothing new about the idea that pharmaceuticals can improve one 's quality of life . Not dying of bacterial infections because antibiotics are available is certainly a quality-of-life improvement . What is new , perhaps , is the focus on personal happiness as a prime or even the sole criterion by which to measure the worth of a drug . <p> " There was a time when drugs to make you thin or drugs to make your hair grow again were kind of looked down upon , " said Mark Edwards , a biotechnology analyst in San Francisco . " Now , these things are starting to be looked at as real medicine . " <p> Many of the new drugs , such as those under development to help people lose weight , will be possible because science is gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the molecular level . Researchers are racing to unravel the body 's genetic code , gaining clues to the underlying causes of conditions such as obesity and to the degenerative changes that accompany aging . Once the root causes are understood , highly specific drugs can be designed to target each problem . <p> " This really is the golden age of pharmaceutical research , " said Andy McCormick , a spokesman for Pfizer Inc. , the company that developed Viagra . " We are learning a tremendous amount rapidly , a lot of it based on the genetic revolution . We 're taking the insights that we 're gaining and applying them to quality-of-life medicines . And Viagra is a good example . " <p> It also is a good example of how costly the new drugs will be to develop and buy . Pfizer says it spent $ 500 million developing Viagra . Drug companies estimate they are spending about $ 20 billion a year developing new treatments , a number that has been rising faster than inflation . <p> Given the up-front development costs , Pfizer says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 50 milligram tablet of Viagra , a price that makes it 14 times more expensive than its equivalent weight in gold . Viagra costs $ 10 a pill at retail . Yet that has n't stopped the many thousands of men who are demanding the drug . <p> In its second week on the market , ending April 10 , doctors wrote 36,263 prescriptions for Viagra , according to figures compiled by IMS America Ltd. , a company in Plymouth Meeting , Pa. that tracks prescriptions . <p> That was before a frenzy over the drug gripped the nation in the past couple of weeks . No detailed figures for those weeks are available yet , but some estimates said doctors were writing as many as 40,000 Viagra prescriptions a day . If the demand holds up , Viagra may well become the best-selling drug in history . <p> Some insurance companies already are balking . Many of the carriers that insure federal employees , for instance , have specific provisions in their contracts that allow them to exclude treatments for sexual dysfunction . <p> The theory , going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living or get along in daily life , and treatment of sexual dysfunction is therefore not " medically necessary . " Treating impotence is , after all , a question of personal happiness , not of survival . <p> Late last week some federal employees reported that their companies already were denying Viagra claims , even for men who can prove clinical impotence . A few health-maintenance organizations , including several on the West Coast , have announced that they will not cover it or will require strict proof of clinical impotence before they will . <p> In the end , the nation will have to decide case-by-case which of the new treatments to pay for through health insurance . It seems clear that drugs to regrow hair or banish wrinkles will not make the cut  --  if people want them , they are likely to have to fork over their own money . <p> But what about drugs to banish fat ? Many people will want to take them largely for cosmetic reasons , but if the drugs truly work without serious side effects , those same people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer cases of heart disease and diabetes , which are major complications of obesity . This could not only make people healthier , but save money in the long run through lesser use of hospital beds and other expensive treatments . <p> Will insurance companies require that people be overweight by a certain fixed percentage before they 'll pay for the drugs ? Will they feel it necessary to set limits on how many pills of Viagra an impotent man can buy with his insurance card  --  deciding , in effect , how many episodes of sex a week are reasonable for a man of a certain age ? <p> And if there are no limits , are Americans prepared to see the cost of health care start rising again , undermining economic growth and hurting people who are n't wealthy ? <p> " We 've had a kind of honeymoon in the last few years on health-care costs , " said Helen Darling , a benefits analyst with Watson Wyatt Worldwide , a consulting company . " These new treatments , repairing damage done over a lifetime , will force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by everyone through socialized dollars . I believe the big crunch is still ahead of us. "
