At the end of last June , when most other Olympic hopefuls were lashed into rigid training programs , Norwegian cross-country skier Vegard ( " the Viking " ) Ulvang was hunkered down somewhere in central Greenland , pondering the vexing little problem of survival . He and his best friend , Frenchman Pierre Gay- % Peret , had set out seven days before to ski 355 miles across the world 's largest island . Though the speediest previous crossing by their chosen route had been 25 days , they had brought enough food for just 20 . " We wanted to go fast , " explains Ulvang . But their pace during the first week had been crabbed by a snowstorm that had obliterated the horizon . " We were forced into a situation where we had to make a really important decision , " says Ulvang . A decision to turn back ? Hardly . The question was how much to eat . They halved their rations , picked up the pace and completed the trip in 15 days and two hours . <P> Ulvang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savors such moments of truth . " It 's the idea of managing the elements that I like , " he says . " In the wilderness or in competition , it takes planning and preparation to succeed . " Norwegian ski officials were as mortified over Ulvang 's Greenland trek as they had been the previous year when he climbed Alaska 's 20,320-ft . Denali , the former Mount McKinley . But not even the most timorous Norwegian trainer is complaining now . Ulvang and his teammate Bjorn Daehlie each won three golds and a silver , leading the national team to 20 medals , a phenomenal haul in light of Norway 's population of only 4.2 million . Ulvang 's four-medal streak sparked such jubilation in his Arctic hometown of Kirkenes that the local stock of champagne has run dry . <P> He started off with gold in the 30-km event , the only men 's cross-country race that Norway had never won . " That 's the one I came here to get , " says Ulvang , who won a bronze medal in the event in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ulvang stormed to a dramatic and unexpected victory in the 10-km , despite breaking a pole and skiing with only one for more than 1,600 ft . For three weeks before the Olympics , a hip injury had kept him from practicing the skating technique used in the 15-km free-style pursuit race , but that did n't stop Ulvang from finishing second to Daehlie . He won a third gold when Norway breezed to victory in the 4 X 10-km relay . Ulvang finished only ninth in the 50-km free-style , but Daehlie won it to complete Norway 's sweep of all five men 's cross-country golds . <P> With disarming naturalness , Ulvang seems to embody the Olympic Charter 's principle of creating " a way of life based on the joy found in effort . " He 's a winner cut from fresh , unbleached cloth . Perhaps a champion whose training segues so perfectly into his recreation can only emerge in a sport that does n't need jumps or rinks , just snow and distance . <P> Ulvang enjoyed plenty of both at home in Kirkenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not see a person or cross a road , " says Ulvang . He 's not being figurative . Every September , Ulvang and his two brothers set off from home and walk for a solid 14 hours in one direction or another . At dusk they pitch a base camp , and for the next week they roam the wilderness hunting ptarmigans.
