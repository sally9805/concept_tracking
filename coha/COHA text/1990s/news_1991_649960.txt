##@x <p> To people outside the Vatican , canonization is rather like winning the Nobel prize . No one knows why one candidate for sainthood is chosen over another or who , apart from the pope , does the selecting . <p> But the prospect of canonizing Queen Isabella of Spain has so outraged Roman Catholics , Jews and Muslims that a Vatican panel has recommended that she not be beatified . Rome would do well to seize this opportunity to explain just how and why this opponent of religious freedom has become a candidate for the church 's highest honor . <p> Jews and Muslims have good reason to be angry . In 1492 , Isabella signed an edict forcing Jews to convert or be expelled from Spain . She also instituted the Inquisition , the church tribunal that tortured and exiled Jews and Muslims who pretended to be Catholic while secretly practicing their own religion . <p> The effort to bestow sainthood on Isabella perplexes many Roman Catholics as well , especially in the U.S. If canonization provides contemporary models of Christian virtue , why propose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachings of Vatican Council II ? Why , after 500 years , revive the memory of the Inquisition , which eventually turned into an instrument for terrorizing Catholics as well . <p> These questions raise a number of issues about the church 's saint-making process . In the Roman Catholic tradition , canonized saints are at once objects of popular piety and products of a rationalized investigative process . To those familiar with Rome 's canonization procedures , it would appear that Isabella 's cause does not satisfy several of the church 's own criteria for sainthood . <p> For example , every candidate must demonstrate a " reputation for holiness " among the ordinary faithful . The theory is that the Holy Spirit moves the faithful to recognize the saints who lived and died among them , and that God Himself confirms this popular intuition by granting posthumous miracles through the candidate 's intercession . <p> This is the populist dimension of saint-making . Yet there is little evidence that Isabella enjoys a genuine reputation for holiness . That there are no miracles attributed to her intercession adds weight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cause . <p> Candidates for canonization , especially public figures , are usually supported by official letters of " postulation " from church leaders and , in Catholic countries , the state . This represents the political dimension of saint-making . In Isabella 's case , however , not a single conference of Catholic bishops , including Spain 's , has endorsed her cause . Nor have King Juan Carlos or Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain . <p> The Vatican 's Congregation for the Causes of Saints has more than 1,200 candidates awaiting official action . Why , after five centuries , did Isabella suddenly merit priority consideration ? The answer , in part , is that she is being promoted by an international committee of clergy and laymen representing a highly conservative party with the church . They include Spanish Bishop Alvardo Portillo , the influential head of Opus Dei , the secretive Catholic movement established in the Franco era , and two of the most conservative cardinals in the American hierarchy , Archbishop Bernard Law of Boston and a retired Archbishop , John Carberry , of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cause is fueled less by popular piety than by an ideological faction for whom she represents the fusion of Roman Catholic faith with the political order . <p> According to the promotional literature published by the commission , Isabella merits canonization for her sponsorship of Christopher Columbus 's voyages to America and for her promotion of Catholic faith and culture . Her timely virtues , the committee writes , are " leadership , prudence , courage , compassion , purity and Christian concern for the temporal and spiritual welfare of all people . " No mention is made of the expulsion of the Jews or of the Inquisition . <p> This is not surprising . Conservative Catholics in Spain and the Americas have for centuries idealized Isabella as a regal Virgin Mother figure , the perfect Catholic queen and wife who purified Spanish religion and culture . <p> The Vatican 's saint-makers pride themselves on their ability to get at the historical truth of a candidate 's life , regardless of who is behind the cause . To halt Isabella 's case just as theologians were preparing to discuss her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome needs to explain how so questionable a candidate has come so close to becoming a saint . What is at stake is not just Isabella 's worthiness to be venerated as a saint but the integrity of the canonization process itself . @@649960 Early Risers <p> Midsummer : The long days begin in bright , rising mist and never end .

The farmers worked . The midsummer days were the best working time of the year for the farmers , but the farmers are gone . They worked , they built , but they 're gone .

It shifted , wavered , passed in woolly swags and swirls , parted . Nearly hidden in the mist , in a corner of the lot , another vehicle , a little car , empty . <p> The sheriff parked his truck in his spot near the court building and walked across the lot to the car , an Escort with its rear window partly broken out and covered with a plastic sheet and tape . He approached the passenger 's side and bent to look inside the car . Not empty . A young woman was curled up in the driver 's seat , asleep . Her knees were pulled up behind the steering wheel ; her head rested against the window . On the passenger 's seat beside her was a kitchen knife with a blade maybe four inches long , and in the rear seat a furry bundle the sheriff could n't quite make out . He tapped lightly on the window . <p> The sleeping woman opened her eyes . She looked around her , then saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew back against her door , watching him .

" <p> " I 'm waiting for the sheriff , " the young woman said again , louder , to be heard through the closed windows of the little car . <p> " I 'm the sheriff . " <p> " You are ? " <p> " Why do n't you come on inside ? " the sheriff said . He nodded toward the courthouse . <p> The young woman made no move to leave the car , but she leaned across the seat and rolled the passenger 's window down a couple of inches . <p> " You do n't have a uniform , " she said . <p> " No , " the sheriff said . He straightened and turned to start back to the courthouse . <p> " How do I know you 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you , " the sheriff said . " You can sit out here long as you want . Maybe another sheriff will come along . " <p> " Wait , " said the young woman . She uncurled herself from the seat , opened the door , and stood beside her car . She was tall and wore her brown hair long , very long , in a soft fall that hung down her back past her shoulder blades . The sheriff watched her . She did n't look drunk , she did n't act drunk , she did n't smell drunk . She closed the car door and looked across its roof at him . <p> " All right , " she said . <p> The sheriff waited for her , letting her go ahead of him . <p> " You first , " said the young woman . <p> The sheriff shook his head . " I ai n't the one with the knife , " he said . " You are . You go in front . " <p> " Oh , " said the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her car . She left it and started toward the courthouse , with the sheriff following her . <p> In his tiny office in the basement of the courthouse Sheriff Wingate pointed to a chair in front of his desk , and the young woman sat . He let her sit for a minute , let her settle , while he fussed . He started the coffee machine , he tore yesterday 's page from his calendar and tossed it into the wastepaper basket . He turned the volume on the radio scanner up , then down . Then he sat behind his desk , facing the young woman . <p> " What can we do for you ? " the sheriff asked her . <p> " I need help , " the young woman said . <p> " Help with what ? " <p> " He 's after me , " she said . " A man . He wants to hurt me . " <p> " A man ?

Coffee ? " He rose and went to the coffee machine . <p> The young woman shook her head . <p> The sheriff poured himself a cup of coffee and returned to his chair . <p> " Blackway 's following you ? " he asked . <p> " That 's what I said . " <p> " For how long ? " <p> " A week , ten days , " the young woman said . " He watches me . Like one time , I was coming out of a lot . He pulled in front of me , cut me off . He just sat there , in that big truck he has . Looking at me . Letting me see him looking at me . Then he went away . He 'd done that before .

She tried to answer , swallowed again . <p> " Take it easy , " said the sheriff . <p> " Annabelle , " the young woman said at last . " He got Annabelle . He came to my place and he got her .
