Sher knock-down power is Important In your bat so are the four other factors By Ros Seyfried // Huge yellow forms haunting magnificent mountains make wapiti the creatures of dreams . If you 're determined to follow these great beasts for the first timeor challenge them more earnestly than you have in the past-you need the right tools . Too often , though , hunters think that means a shoulderdislocating cannon . There 's moreand less-to it than that : In choosing an elk rifle , you need to consider the size of elk you 'll be hunting , the terrain , your shooting ability and recent bullet technology . Here 's how to determine the right rifle for you . " DIFFERENT " ELK Many gun buyers are surprised by the concept of " different elk , " and especially that the term does not refer to a variety of species . All elk are not giant bulls ; most are lesser bulls , spikes and cows . In fact , the average harvested elk weighs between 400 and 600 pounds , which means most elk hunters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small elephant gun . If you 're a pure trophy hunter , however-the kind of guy who turns down all but mature bulls-your requirements are somewhat different . Monster elk are more rare , they 're tougher animals to bring down and you 'll be more tempted to try a shot at a bad angle . You should lean toward the heavier calibers , which we 'll discuss later . Otherwise , you 're looking for a caliber that provides reasonable penetration-enough for a shoulder shot on a 500-pound critter . Before we get to the specifics , let 's consider some other factors that should influence your decision . HUNTING CONDITIONS Do n't assume , if you have n't hunted elk before , that hunts fall into rigidly defined categories . If you buy a specialized tool for a specific set of hunting conditions , you 're very apt to handicap yourself because of the unpredictability of the hunt . For example , it 's unwise to think that because you 'll be hunting in a timbered region you wo n't need some range capability . If you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as likely as not the elk will offer a shot across the only clearing for miles , while you 're holding a rifle suited to a 50-yard shot in a pole patch . Or , if you head out with an extreme-velocity rifle , planning to snipe across the valley with light missiles , you 're apt to find a bull in the timber where that screaming little bullet will blow to pieces on his shoulder . And , when you 're armed with a featherweight rifle designed for mountain climbing , Murphy 's Law guarantees that you 'll have to make a 250-yard shot , in a stiff breeze , while you 're panting and puffing . Here , you 'll find the wand that was so easy to carry is almost impossible to hold steady . Your elk rifle should be one with the advantage of versatility , rather than the handicap of specialization . Fortunately , versatility is not that difficult to achieve . For one thing , timber/brush rifles really do not exist . No bullet can chop through a lot of brush and still hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot through holes in the bushes . So rule out heavy-caliber , so-called " brush-cutting " rifles like the .45-70 or .375 in favor of one with the shootability to miss the bushes and hit the elk , even at long range . Secondly , cross-canyon , long-range game shooting is overrated . Most of the time a hunter can get closer . When that 's out of the question , it 's usually better to say " no " if the range is much farther than 300 yards . While most modern calibers suited to elk hunting can easily handle the 300-yard shot , not even the " thunder-clappers " can make a 400-yard hit easy . When a rare 400-yard shot is made , it 's the product of the rifleman , not the rifle . Finally , it 's also the rare day when an eight-pound rifle will stop you from hunting someplace where you would continue if you had shouldered a six-pounder . The upshot : There 's no need for an exotic rifle in elk hunting . PERSONAL ABILITY Photograph With today 's premium-bullet loads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the .300 Winchester Magnum . But for true trophy hunters , who may be faced with long-range shots or difficult angles on trophy-class animals , rifles like the author 's custom Champlin chambered for the .340 Weatherby Magnum are the way to go . // To make the perfect elk-rifle equation work , you must add your personal preferences and limitations as a shooter to the size of elk and the hunting conditions you 'll encounter . While you must guard against automatically choosing too much rifle , you should be equally sure that you have enough . And this depends largely on personal ability . For every ounce of wumph you pour out the muzzle , you pay a price in noise and recoil . Does the recoil of a .30/06 disturb you ? If not , how about the boom and buck of a .300 magnum ? I find the comfort level for most people lies somewhere in between . Certainly as you go past the .300s , the precision of most shooters begins to fall off . Answering the power question takes strength and courage-the strength and courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that a .300 is too much . As an elk guide , I 'm a lot happier with a hunter who centers the clockwork with a .270 than one who hits the paunch with something bigger . THE CALIBERS As you ponder how much power you need or can handle , let 's throw the last variable into the equation . Bullet technology has made rifles " bigger . " That is , calibers that were formerly considered too small for elk are now up to the challenge , and once-marginal calibers are today 's perfection . New-age bullets penetrate more deeply , retain their weight better and release their energy more efficiently . ( Everything I say here about calibers assumes that you use the best bullets money can buy . ) Once , I would have considered the .270 Winchester a very questionable elk caliber . Given today 's bullets , however , it 's just fine . In years past , the .30/06 was marginal and the .300 magnums used to be okay . In 1998 , the ' 06 is a good elk rifle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .338 Winchester and .340 Weatherby , once considered " cinch " elk medicine , are really more powerful than the average elk hunter needs . Today , they 're the tools of big-bull specialists . And anything larger than that is unnecessary . The fellow who packs a .375 H &H; is doing so just for the fun and difficulty of it . The rifle that houses the caliber should also be moderate . Elk rifles should be bolt-action or single-shot . Those who carry pumps or autos , hoping that many shots will overcome other weaknesses , are making a big mistake . Barrels should be long enough to allow the ammunition to deliver full velocity . Generally speaking , standard calibers are happy with 24-inch barrels , while the magnums put their best foot forward with 26-inch tubes . Go with a rifle that weighs between seven and nine pounds , unless , because of physical reasons , you require an extremely light rifle . Look for a cartridge with a velocity between 2700 and 3000 feet per second and 140- to 180-grain bullets . The lighter bullets are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier ones are used in the .30s . If you 're going out to buy a rifle for the sole purpose of pursuing elk and you 're not intimidated by its recoil ( remember , be honest ) , a .300 Winchester Magnum is as good as it gets . If you do not have experience with a big .30 , make arrangements to borrow one for a test drive . Try it on the range-not from the benchrest , but from standing , sitting and kneeling positions . Shoot at a paper plate 200 yards away . If you find yourself flinching or you have watery eyes , trembling fingers and only a few holes in the paper after several shots , look to a smaller caliber . A 7mm magnum .280 or .30/06 may be the perfect compromise for you . I find that women and young hunters are hard-pressed to go bigger than a .270 or .280 . If you 're considering a muzzle brake , forget it . The noise is far worse than any level of recoil . If your rifle needs a muzzle brake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elk rifle that gives you confidence . Do n't rush out and buy power for the sake of power alone . Select adequate power that you can apply with surgical precision . Elk are big and majestic ; they deserve a rifle that allows you to do your job perfectly . <p>
