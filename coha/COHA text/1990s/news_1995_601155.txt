<p> Bonds are beautiful - at least for now . <p> Traders , bankers , speculators , and investors clawed over each other Tuesday to buy bonds , driving bond prices up - and yields down . The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond punched below 7% Tuesday for the first time since March 1994 . <p> If bond yields keep falling - or just stay low - the repercussions will be enormous . Bond mutual fund investors will reap big gains . Home buyers can expect lower mortgage rates , homeowners with high rates can save by refinancing at lower rates . Corporations can refinance long-term debt at low rates . And the economy , which has shown signs of weakening , could get a boost as well from consumer spending . The one hitch : Most analysts think the big rally in bonds will soon fizzle . <p> Tuesday , fresh signs of a slowing economy - rising wholesale inventories - helped push the yield on the 30-year T-bond down to 6.94% from 7.03% Monday . It 's down more than a quarter-point since Thursday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money managers are stunned . " I did n't think the 30-year T-bond yield would go below 7.25% , " says Bill Fleckenstein , money manager at Olympic Capital Management in Seattle . " I sure as hell did n't think it would go below 7% . " <p> The rate drop may have caught some on Wall Street by surprise , but Main Street is sure to applaud . For example , mortgage rates should tumble . The average 30-year mortgage rate is 8.27% , down from 9.22% since January . Mortgage rates track the yield on 10-year Treasury notes , which fell to 6.59% Tuesday . By next week , mortgage rates should fall below 8% , says Mark Obrinsky , economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association . <p> Corporate America also could be in for a windfall . Many companies rushed to lock in low rates on their debts during the last bond rally in 1993 . So they were able to sit tight through last year 's bear market . But now , with the economy still growing , many firms are looking to borrow again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 700 million in long-term bonds to retire some of its short-term debt . The company expects to reap big savings from the recent drop in bond yields . " We could n't be happier , " says Treasurer Brian Heidtke . <p> The Dow Jones industrial average has had a 14.5% runup this year because of falling rates . But stocks could soon decouple from the bond market . Tuesday 's bond rally helped push the Dow to 4390.78 , its 26th record this year , but the gain was a meager 6.91 points . " It smells like the end of the line for a while , " says Oppenheimer strategist Michael Metz . <p>  --  Bond mutual funds should soar . Prices of existing bonds rise when market interest rates fall . That 's because a bond 's interest payments do n't change . For example , a bond with a face value of $ 1,000 yielding 7.6% pays a fixed $ 76 in annual interest . But newly issued bonds now yield just 6.9% , or pay $ 69 on a $ 1,000 investment . The older bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield equal to the market rate of 6.9% . The bond rally already has helped the average government bond fund return 6.8% through May 5 this year , with interest reinvested , says industry tracker Morningstar . That 's a big change from 1994 , when the average government bond fund lost 3.6% . Why the change ? <p>  --  Recession fears . The bond market hates inflation , which erodes the value of bonds and the fixed interest they pay . Inflation often is the byproduct of an overheated economy . So bond prices often soar on gloomy economic news and low inflation . <p> By pushing long-term interest rates down so far and so fast , investors are betting the economy will slow to a crawl the rest of 1995 - and might even tumble into a recession . " The bond market has gone beyond a soft landing , " says David Jones , chief economist for brokerage Aubrey G. Lanston . " It thinks we 're going to crash on the runway . " <p> That thinking underscores the dramatic shift in sentiment from January , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 's torrid 4% pace . Bond traders feared such a boom could force the Fed to lift the key federal funds rate - the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans - as high as 8% to stifle inflation . Now , investors are betting the Fed will cut rates later this year as the economy continues to slow . <p>  --  Short squeezes . If you think bond prices will fall , you can borrow bonds from a bond dealer and sell them , hoping to buy them back later at a higher price . Suppose you sell 100 T-bonds for $ 1,000 each . You get $ 100,000 from the sale . Rates rise , and the bond 's price falls to $ 925 . You buy back for $ 92,500 , give them to your dealer , and pocket the $ 7,500 difference . <p> But if T-bond prices rise , you lose money . A short squeeze happens when many investors are short T-bonds and bond prices rise steeply . Short-sellers then scramble to buy T-bonds and close their short position . But all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what happened Tuesday , says Jay Goldinger of Los Angeles based investment firm Capital Insight . " It has been a massive short squeeze . " <p>  --  Foreign central banks , primarily the Bank of Japan , have bought more than $ 34 billion in Treasuries since January . Those purchases are a side effect of their efforts to prop the dollar . When foreign central banks buy dollars , they usually turn around and invest those dollars in the Treasury market . <p> " The central banks have really lit a booster rocket under this rally , " says James Bianco , bond analyst for Arbor Trading Group . <p>  --  Technical factors . About $ 15 billion in 3-year government notes came due Tuesday . Most of that was reinvested in T-notes . Other government securities paid $ 10 billion in interest Tuesday - much of which went back into long-term bonds . <p>  --  Sheer panic . Portfolio managers who had n't bought bonds the past few days bought Tuesday . " Even at these levels , they are afraid of not being in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Dean Witter Reynolds . <p> Some wonder whether the market is setting itself up for a fall . " I did n't think the 30-year T-bond market was attractive at 7.4% , " says Ian MacKinnon , portfolio manager at Vanguard Group . " So I can think of no fundamental explanation for what 's going on now . " <p> Others take an even more ominous view of the rally : " It 's not a speculative bubble yet , but it could evolve into one , " says David Hale , chief economist at Kemper Financial . <p> Why some bond watchers are wary : The economy is n't in danger of recession . Virtually no Fed watcher expects Fed policymakers to cut rates at their May 23 meeting . Only a few economists expect a rate cut this year . And some analysts believe the Fed still may raise rates another notch or two , although not until the economy pulls out of its recent slump . <p> Ironically , the bond market 's bullish surge may speed that rebound . Builders already are reporting a snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , " says Mike Henn , chief financial officer for Kaufman &; Broad , Southern California 's biggest homebuilder . " It 's the first piece of good news our industry has gotten in more than a year . " <p> Contributing : David Craig and Patrick McGeehan
