Prologue // A sense of nervous anticipation was building in the moist and muggy Atlanta air that late July morning . It was an hour before the heptathlon competition at the 1996 Olympic Games and the serious business of preparing for combat was well underway on the warmup track . Coaches reviewed strategy on the sidelines , while their athletes limbered up on the infield . Around them , competitors of every race , nationality and shoe company affiliation paraded around the jogging track , as television crews from NBC and CNN moved into position , angling for pictures and sound bites . // Sprinkled among the group were my opponents , the world 's most versatile and gifted female athletes . They included Sabine Braun of Germany , Ghada Shouaa of Syria , Natasha Sazanovich of Belarus , Denise Lewis of Great Britain and Kelly Blair of the United States . Every four years , such a group gathered at an Olympic venue to contest the heptathlon , a two-day , seven-part trial of endurance and skill . To claim victory , a woman must outperform her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing the high-jump bar , throwing the javelin , sprinting 200 meters , leaping into the long-jump pit , putting the shot and running 800 meters . Her reward at the culmination of the grueling ordeal is an Olympic gold medal and the designation " World 's Greatest Female Athlete . " // Over the past thirteen years , the event had repeatedly tested my mettle . I had conquered opponents both human and inhumane : the East Germans , the Russians , drenching rains , extreme heat , pain , exhaustion , dehydration , asthma . Between 1984 and the beginning of 1996 , I won every single heptathlon I completed , posting the six highest scores in the sport 's history , setting four world records , winning two World Championships , and capturing two Olympic gold medals along the way . // Impressive as my record was , I did n't feel the least bit invincible that morning in Atlanta . Splayed on my stomach across a white bath towel on the infield grass , I thought only of my ailing right thigh . The fingers of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hamstring muscle and scar tissue inside the thigh , still tender from the severe pull I 'd suffered three weeks earlier . Gold medals and world records were far from my mind . Given the precarious condition of my leg , my goal was simply to survive the four events on the day 's schedule . // My elaborate plans for a final Olympic heptathlon triumph were slowly unraveling . I 'd chosen this occasion as the perfect opportunity for a swan song . I 'd made my Olympic debut at the Los Angeles Games in 1984 . Now , after achieving so much on foreign soil  --  a world record in Moscow , gold medals in Seoul and Barcelona , world championships in Rome and Stuttgart  --  I wanted to close out my participation in this event in my homeland , with the eyes of the world watching . // There were still a few springs left in my legs for long jumping , my other specialty . But my days as a heptathlete were numbered . I still held the heptathlon world record , at 7,291 points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toll on my body , chipping away at my muscle mass and sapping my energy . As well , my chronic asthma condition was affecting me more and more on the track . I 'd come close to dying off the track . I wanted to spend my final moment as a heptathlete on the medal stand , not on an ambulance stretcher. // I was drained emotionally , too . Dominance , I 'd learned over the years , brings both adulation and attacks . No sooner had the " greatest female athlete " crown been placed on my head in 1988 than the efforts to knock it off began . I faced unfounded accusations of steroid use , heard unkind remarks about my appearance , and read hypercritical reviews of my performances . I tried to endure it all with good cheer . But in truth , the sniping hurt me deeply . If , as the critics kept saying , I was only as good as my last heptathlon performance , I wanted the final one in Atlanta to be my best of all . // But things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sprained an ankle , pulled my right hamstring , and battled a cold and an asthma attack during the meet and lost by three points to Kelly Blair , who performed magnificently as I struggled . It was my first defeat in twelve years . Then , just twenty-one days before the Olympics , the scar tissue gnarled around my right hamstring jerked away from the muscle while I was airborne over a hurdle . When the pain registered , I jumped and fell to the track , screaming in agony and rage . My leg had been obstinate since then . Each time I tried to blast out of the starting blocks or push across the shot-put ring in practice , the pain was excruciating . I had n't been able to test the leg 's strength , to employ it as I would have to in competition . // Now , with the moment at hand and my therapist 's fingers furiously kneading that scar tissue and all the other tortured muscle fibers , I winced and wondered . Was my hamstring strong enough for the task ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help me get over 100 meters of track and hurdles , to clear the high-jump bar , to provide the power to throw the javelin and , after all of that , to run 200 meters at world-class speed ? // I had no idea . // * * * // As I walked into the packed Olympic Stadium , the sky turned gloomy . Raindrops dotted my legs and arms as we lined up in front of the blocks for the hurdle race . The drops became sprinkles and turned quickly into sheets of showers . The starter called us to the blocks and I insisted to myself that I was ready . Staring down my lane at the arrayed hurdles , I focused on starting strong and moving steadily forward , one step at a time . // I shot out of the blocks without pain . A good sign . I was in front heading into the series of hurdles . First , second , third , fourth . All cleared . So far , so good . Fifth , sixth ... oh , God ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Keep going , " I told myself . " Do n't stop . It hurts , but there are only three left . " // I gathered all my strength , and tackled the eighth . My cheeks puffing furiously , I gritted my teeth to cushion the pain as I landed . I pushed on to the ninth . Another deep breath , the jump , the wince , the exhale . One more . I gritted my teeth as I cleared it . Then , a grimace at the finish line . I made it ! Not only was I still in the competition , I 'd won the heat . Now , to get some help for my throbbing leg . // Dripping wet , I grabbed my gear and hobbled toward my husband and coach , Bobby Kersee . I was panting and in terrible pain , but I stopped on the way for a brief interview in the downpour with Cris Collinsworth of NBC , who held an umbrella over us . Between gasps , I told him , " I want to stay positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my physical therapist get in there and dig out whatever 's in the muscle . " // We went to the coaches ' room , hoping to use one of the massage tables . But they would n't allow Bobby inside , even though he was my coach , because he did n't have the proper pass . So , the three of us , Bobby , Bob the therapist and I , climbed a flight of stairs inside the stadium to the concession area , where we found a little-used handicap-access ramp . I threw down a towel and stretched out on my stomach . Bobby and Bob went to work with ice packs and massaging hands to quiet the spasms inside my thigh . Spectators watching us from their seats applauded and shouted encouragement . " We love you , Jackie ! " " You 're the best ! " " Good luck ! " // Hearing them , I wished with all my heart that I 'd be able to continue . // The spasms eventually subsided . And after an hour-and-a-half rain delay , the heptathletes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd watched my therapy session cheered as I made my way down to the field . I took a practice jump at a very low height and knocked the bar down . I knew I was in trouble . But I refused to surrender . I walked across the track to the stadium railing , where Bobby was standing . " It feels like it 's pulling , " I said . " If I accelerate , I do n't know what will happen . I 'll try the next height and see . " // I turned and walked away . As I crossed the track and reached the high-jump apron , I heard Bobby 's voice over my shoulder . He 'd jumped over the railing and was walking up behind me . " That 's it , Jackie , " he shouted . " I 'm not going to let you do this . " // I knew if he was on the track I was already finished in the competition because he did n't have a pass . But I protested anyway . " No , Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try . " // He led me to the tent where the heptathletes had gathered . We sat on the grass . He looked at me and said , " I 've watched you for twelve years give everything you 've got . I 'm no longer going to allow you to do this . It 's time to go . " // " Bobby , I just want to try . " // " No , Jackie , this is n't a coach-athlete thing . This is your husband telling you it 's time for you to go . " // It was over . I sat there a good three to five minutes absorbing the impact , while Bobby told the officials I was withdrawing . I tried to hold back the tears , but they poured out of my eyes , down my cheeks . Bobby started crying , too . I leaned against him and put my head on his shoulder . He put his arm around me . We sobbed together . // Ghada Shouaa , a Syrian heptathlete , came over and hugged me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed Bobby . That was the greatest compliment a competitor could have paid me . Sabine Braun of Germany came over and patted me on the back . It was a touching gesture considering our tense rivalry . I gathered my paraphernalia and walked off the track with Bobby . None of the spectators knew what was happening , so there was no reaction . We walked past a wall of reporters . I was too upset to talk . If I had tried to open my mouth and speak , I would have burst into tears . // Bob , Bobby and I walked back to the hotel , just a few blocks from the stadium , in silence . With the track and field events underway , the streets around the stadium were deserted and deadly quiet . It was like being in a funeral procession . A funeral for my dead dream . // * * * // Within minutes our hotel room filled with our friends : my high school track coach , Nino Fennoy , and his friend Toni ; my aunt Della ; my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best friend , Dave Harris , and his wife ; my orthopedist , Dr. Rick Lehman ; Bobby 's sister Debra ; Valerie Brisco , Jeanette Bolden and Valarie Foster , my assistant . Dave and his wife walked in wearing custom-printed caps that read , " JJK STILL NO. 1 . " // As each visitor came in and saw me , there was a new round of hugs , kisses and tears . The room was filled with warm affection . After what we 'd just been through , it was the perfect tonic for Bobby and me . What began as the worst of days was ending as the best . // The phone rang nonstop , once the word got out that I 'd withdrawn . Reporters wanted to interview us . I still could n't talk about what had happened . Bobby agreed to go to the broadcast center for an interview with NBC 's Dwight Stones . During the telecast , Tom Hammond and Dwight discussed my career , tracing the ups and downs . Their report showed scenes of Bobby yelling at me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my victories . // Tom and Dwight said such wonderful things . For the first time in my career , I felt appreciated and respected for my accomplishments . " She is clearly the greatest female athlete of her day , " Tom said . " If judged by her heart , then surely the greatest of all time . " Tears came to my eyes . // Then Bobby 's face appeared on screen . I could see how red his eyes were through his tinted glasses . As he described our conversation before I withdrew , he choked up and tears filled his eyes . In the hotel room we were all crying . // " Jackie Joyner-Kersee is very , very important to track and field , " Dwight said in conclusion . " There 's no argument that she is the greatest female athlete of all time . " // Most people never get to hear such tributes , because they 're bestowed after they die , at their funeral . I felt so privileged to hear them while I was alive . It was a shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby returned to the hotel room just in time for a call from Bill Cosby , our friend and trusted advisor for many years . Bill said he was thinking about us . Then , he teased me about the fight he figured Bobby and I were having about the decision to withdraw . It made me laugh . " I know you and Bob are going to get into it , " he said . " But why do n't you listen to your husband one time ? " // Then he talked to Bobby and kidded him , " Try not to be so evil to your wife , man . " // Flowers arrived throughout the day . One vase was from Aretha Franklin . Another arrangement arrived from Arsenio Hall . Lionel Richie also sent a bouquet . Late that night , we received a message that President Clinton was trying to reach us . He left a number to the retreat at Camp David , Maryland . // I was dumbfounded . To think that the President would take the time to call me and offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby called the number right after reading me the note . It was about 11:00 P.M. We worried that it was too late . But the President told us to call , so we did . // When Bobby handed me the receiver and I heard President Clinton say , " Hi , Jackie , " I was speechless . He told me I 'd done a lot to inspire the youth of the nation . Of all the nice things he said during the conversation , that compliment made me proudest . He also said he believed that Bobby had made the right decision in pulling me from the heptathlon , because it preserved my chance to come back for the long jump . I smiled as I listened to him , but I was tongue-tied . All I could manage was " thank you , Mr. President . " // * * * // The question on everyone 's mind after my withdrawal was whether I had a realistic chance of making it back to the track for the long jump . I had four and a half days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muscle . Subjecting it to additional stress would be like playing Russian roulette . It could rip the very next time I tried to run hard . That would surely end my athletic career , and possibly maim me for life . // But in my mind , the decision came down to this : I could n't let that tearful withdrawal stand as my final Olympic act . Though my entire athletic career might be at risk , I knew what I had to do . It was time to reach deep into the core of myself , to call on the voices from my past  --  alternately sympathetic , challenging , even derisive  --  that had urged me on over thirty-four years of living and competing . At the appointed hour , I would show up at the long-jump pit , and hope and pray I could respond one last time . //
