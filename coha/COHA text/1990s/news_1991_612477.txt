" asks Joseph Brown , a wide-eyed 11-year-old who portrays Leroy , Sarah 's brother who mimes out the battle scene before an impressed Brown Sugar . <p> To honor his bravery , Brown Sugar lays out a suite of sweet dances for him and Sarah ( who replaces Clara , or Mary , from the traditional " Nutcracker " ) , as if it were a smorgasbord of sugar and spice . The children 's throne , from which they 'll view the dances , will be shaped as a giant sundae , complete with a cherry on top . Storyteller Woodie Persons , from the Gate City Heritage House in West End , will narrate the story . <p> " We have adapted The Nutcracker ' without changing its theme so that it 's acceptable to our reality , sort of like The Wiz ' did for The Wizard of Oz , ' " says Mr. Lucas , who co-directs the company with Ms. Gilreath .
