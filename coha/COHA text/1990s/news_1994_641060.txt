<p> In the dusty , dog-eared law books that list society 's dos and don'ts , Title IX might as well be tucked among those often-ignored edicts that ban speeding and jaywalking . <p> The 21-year-old law , which prohibits sexual discrimination in college athletics , has been snubbed roundly by the schools it 's supposed to guide and largely neglected by the federal agency responsible for enforcing it , say legal experts . <p> And Colorado is rife with Title IX sinners , a Denver Post survey has found . For instance : <p> Six of the 16 Colorado colleges offering intercollegiate sports readily admit their athletic programs violate Title IX , even though the law now is older than most of their students . <p> Six other Colorado schools still do n't meet the law 's ultimate goal of equal opportunity - proportionality . For example , if women make up 45 percent of a college 's enrollment ( and pay 45 percent of the athletic fees ) , they are entitled to 45 percent of the athletic benefits . <p> A federal judge in Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after school officials eliminated women 's softball for financial reasons . <p> Members of the CSU softball team sued the school under Title IX and won . The U.S. Supreme Court five weeks ago opted not to hear that case , letting the decision stand . <p> " The schools in Colorado are very much part of a national pattern of severe noncompliance with Title IX , " said Ellen Vargyas , senior counsel for education at the National Women 's Law Center in Washington , D.C. <p> " And the argument that everyone else is doing it does n't count for much , " added Vargyas , one of the lawyers who represented the CSU softball players . <p> Yet just about everyone is doing it , says the Women 's Sports Foundation . The Long Island , N.Y. , watchdog estimates 99 percent of all NCAA schools are sidestepping Title IX . As a result , more men compete and more women watch . <p> In court , women athletes have yet to lose a Title IX case against a school . And a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new wave of lawsuits against college athletic departments , legal experts say . <p> " Schools now realize , ' We 're going to lose . If we really have to do this ( get into compliance ) , we want to make our own decisions , not have the courts tell us . ' We 're beginning to see some movement , " said Donna Lopiano , head of the Women 's Sports Foundation . <p> Throughout Colorado , women make up 46 percent of the college enrollment , yet they represent only 33 percent of the athletic participants , get 37 percent of the sports scholarships and enjoy just 33 percent of the athletic budgets . <p> " It 's always been interesting how college administrators can rationalize why there 's not equal funding when Title IX is a law . Point blank , a law , " said Tracey Sheehan , women 's basketball coach at the University of Denver . <p> Yet Title IX is much more than a quota machine tied solely to dry proportions and rock-hard ratios , legal experts point out . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first test is proportionality . However , even if a school 's participation and scholarship numbers are out of whack , it can satisfy the law by showing a history of " continuing program expansion , " said Denver attorney Karen Robertson . <p> That could mean adding a few women 's teams over time to give female students more chances to compete , said Robertson , who helped litigate the case against CSU . <p> Even if a college fails those two tests , it still can meet compliance if officials can verify there is no interest or talent to support another women 's team . <p> In Colorado , the shades of compliance are as varied as the college campuses , which stretch from the high plains of Greeley to icy peaks of Durango . <p> CSU , in Fort Collins , may be the most infamous regional college in the Title IX arena , thanks mainly to the softball lawsuit . Yet nine other Colorado colleges fare worse than CSU in their participation ratios . <p> Topping that list is Mesa State College in Grand Junction . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women make up 30 percent of the student athletes . What 's more , they share in 31 percent of the scholarships and 27 percent of the athletic budget . <p> " We 're in trouble on our percentages , " said Steve Kirkham , Mesa 's sports information director . <p> But the college is creeping toward compliance . <p> It will add three scholarships for female athletes next year ( worth $ 16,000 ) and it 's " looking at " launching a women 's soccer or track team , Kirkham said . To pay for the moves , Mesa will freeze spending on its four men 's teams for about five years . <p> " I think right now we would not be in compliance , but we 're on our way , " Kirkham said . <p> Not good enough , responds Title IX expert Vargyas . <p> " You do n't get points for trying in ' 94 . There was a phase-in period for Title IX from 1975 to 1978 . You got points for trying in ' 78 . Now , colleges are out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the whining of ( college administrators ) that , ' We 're trying . Get off our backs . We 're doing what we can , ' this is 20 years later . Give us a break . ... Do n't expect sympathy . You made your bed , now lie in it . " <p> Another school grappling with proportionality is Colorado College , a private school in Colorado Springs . Women there make up 52 percent of the enrollment , yet only 34 percent of the athletes . Women get 33 percent of the sports scholarships and 24 percent of the athletic pie . <p> To compensate , school officials either will add more women 's teams , cut a men 's squad or do a combination of both , said CC Athletic Director Max Taylor . That decision will come in April . <p> Could the school 's storied football team , which posted an 8-1 record last season , become a Title IX casualty ? Perhaps . <p> " I would not speculate if people should be worried about the future of football ( here ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many , many years . In fact , in our trophy case are a couple of footballs from victories over ( the universities of ) Colorado and Texas , " Taylor said . <p> " Our general philosophy would lead us away from cutting down on ( sports ) opportunities . But financial reality could mean we have to " kill a men 's team . <p> Football has been called " the uncommon denominator " in the Title IX war because no women 's sport can match the sheer numbers of men that play it nor the massive dollars often injected into big-time programs . It skews the balance . <p> At Adams State College , Athletic Director Vivian Frausto says : " We 're in compliance to the penny with the exception of putting football into the equation . And if you ask schools to do that you 're going to put athletic programs out of business . " <p> Some Colorado coaches advocate a weighted formula that would measure football differently under Title IX . They argue that football can be a cash cow for the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's programs . <p> However , 45 percent of the Division 1-A football teams are losing an average of $ 628,000 a year , according to an NCAA report . <p> " Football coaches feel if they have to drop scholarships , it 'll hurt the program to where the public wo n't be interested . I do n't buy that , " said Bruce Allison , athletic director at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden . ( The Mines football team went 2-7-1 this year . ) <p> " People filled Michigan Stadium in the ' 30s and ' 40s ( when there were fewer scholarships ) , " Allison said . " If everyone plays on a level field , it will still be an excellent product . Where are these kids going to go ? Canada ? " <p> The University of Denver does n't have a football team , but it is struggling with Title IX . <p> Enrollment at the school leans heavily toward women ( 56 percent ) , yet female athletes account for just 35 percent of the sports participants . They get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sports budget . <p> Vargyas called DU 's ratios " terrible . " <p> " I hate to say that . That 's my friend Diane Wendt ( at DU ) , " Vargyas said . <p> Wendt , DU 's associate athletic director , also is one of 16 members of the NCAA 's Gender Equity Task Force , which was commissioned nationally to study the hot-button issue . <p> Wendt would n't say whether her college is out of compliance with Title IX , but she acknowledged " there is a lot of work yet to be done . ... We believe moving the program to a better place is in everyone 's best interest . " <p> DU Athletic Director Jack McDonald was more direct : " We speak as sinners , as well . We do n't speak as people who are anywhere near where we should be . " <p> Like most Colorado schools , DU is paying up to try to get to that " better place . " <p> The school has committed $ 200,000 to women 's teams to pay for new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first stage of what DU officials call their " women 's athletics enhancement program . " <p> The money came from a blend of new revenues and budget adjustments inside the DU athletic department . Still , the women 's athletic statistics that Vargyas called " terrible " already had been boosted by DU 's enhancement program . <p> One Colorado sports program drawing mixed reviews is the Air Force Academy north of Colorado Springs . Its teams have reached almost a perfect gender ratio with the student body , which is 87 percent male . ( Air Force , as a military academy , is exempt from Title IX ) . <p> However , the men 's teams all play in Division 1 while the women compete in the lower Division 2 . And that infuriates some boosters of women 's sports . <p> An upgrade to Division 1 would mean that , instead of motoring 60 miles to Denver for a game against Regis University , the women 's basketball team might have to fly to Honolulu ( like the men ) to play the University of Hawaii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all the time " because of the women 's Division 2 designation , said Col. Kenneth Schweitzer , the Air Force athletic director . " We have surveyed our women " and they agree they are better served in Division 2 . <p> Title IX expert Vargyas is incensed . <p> " I ca n't see any remote reason for " keeping the women in Division 2 , she said . " Money , as CSU learned , is not a defense . These women , who want to be fighter pilots , are happy with this ? Hey , I 've got a bridge I 'd like to sell you . " <p> Maj. Bob Swanson , the women 's tennis coach at Air Force , said his players are content in Division 2 . He added he has " no opinions " on the matter and that his team " could survive both ways . " <p> There are reasons for the arrangement , Schweitzer said . With only 537 women on campus , it would be difficult for them to field competitive Division 1 teams . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's teams . <p> " Right now , our ( women 's ) competition is in Colorado , " Schweitzer said . " If we go Division 1 , the budget has to be increased " to cover larger coaching staffs and more travel . <p> The NCAA has given Air Force a three-year waiver for the setup . But it recommended the academy lift its women 's program to Division 1 by 1997 . <p> Schweitzer says : " When those budgets go up , obviously we wo n't be able to sponsor the 17 men 's programs ( we do now ) . We have to cut ( one or more teams ) . " <p> Scores of men 's teams everywhere - mainly those in secondary sports like tennis and swimming - will be killed as a result of the Title IX compliance push , Colorado athletic directors predict . <p> Some coaches believe the outcries for equity will force colleges to drop all men 's varsity sports except for basketball and football , with women having as many as 10 sports to balance the scales . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about immediate equality and then in the same breath say , ' We do n't want to diminish opportunities for men , " ' said Jim Fallis , athletic director at the University of Northern Colorado . <p> " We ca n't do both in these economic times , but we ca n't put our heads in the sand in terms of women 's college athletics . " <p> There are bright spots in the battle . A handful of Colorado colleges flatly claim total compliance with Title IX . And they satisfied the law without bloody program cuts . <p> " We are the model program in the country down here , no ifs , ands or buts , " trumpets Jay Beeton , a spokesman for the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs . " We dedicate the exact amount of money to men 's sports as we do to women 's sports . " <p> The enrollment at UCCS is 55 percent female . Women 's teams get 51 percent of the athletic budget , women make up 45 percent of the student athletes and get 47 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratios acceptable . <p> " We 've had intercollegiate athletics for six years , " Beeton said . " The way the money flowed and the emergence of athletics all occurred at the same time . That 's why it was easy for this institution to do . We 're not burdened by tradition . " <p> Metropolitan State College of Denver boasts even better numbers - ratios that are within 5 percentage points of perfection . But administrators there took a different course to compliance . <p> Metro State officials in the 1980s invited the federal Office of Civil Rights to review the college 's sports programs . The OCR , part of the U.S. Department of Education , is the agency assigned to enforce Title IX . <p> OCR inspectors gave Metro State a three-year plan to come into compliance , including upgrading locker rooms for female athletes and adding more women 's scholarships . <p> " We were certified after that as being in full compliance , " said Athletic Director Bill Helman . " All we 've done since is shift even more money to women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's Title IX traffic cop is awful among some legal experts and women 's sports groups . Many accuse the agency of allowing the huge compliance problems to fester . <p> " They have simply not done the job , " Lopiano said . " They 've been unable to put together well-trained experts . And the record shows it . Ninety-five percent of all schools are out of compliance , and nobody 's doing anything . " <p> Others say the OCR 's poor showing can be traced to the Reagan and Bush administrations . Those presidents " did n't believe in the enforcement of civil rights , and it shows , " Vargyas said . <p> But she and other critics hope President Clinton will bring a new Title IX emphasis to the OCR . <p> " It is one of ( our ) priorities , " said Lillian Gutierrez , director of the OCR 's regional office in Denver . Title IX , one civil rights area monitored by the agency , has been part of the OCR 's " national enforcement strategies " for about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " open compliance reviews " under way at colleges and high schools across the country , including two in Colorado , an agency official said . <p> The University of Colorado is undergoing a random Title IX review and the results are expected soon . Typically , the OCR will " negotiate " an agreement with an offending college . It then helps the school meet compliance goals , Gutierrez said . <p> CSU is the second Colorado school getting OCR guidance . But it has been under the agency 's scrutiny since 1983 . A corrective action plan negotiated between the school and the OCR that year has never been fulfilled , according to attorney Robertson . <p> " During the ' 80s the OCR let schools get away with anything , " Vargyas said . " They never did anything to CSU . " <p> What the OCR can do is yank a school 's federal funding . Virtually every college receives some federal dollars . <p> But never once has a U.S. college been penalized by the OCR with a funding cut , acknowledged agency spokesman Roger Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work on Title IX . <p> " I believe the office has been more effective ( lately ) , " Gutierrez said . " I think we have done more reviews in the recent past . But I 'd really rather our headquarters office " respond to the critics ' views . <p> ( Two weeks of requests by The Denver Post to interview officials at the OCR office in Washington , D.C. , were not fulfilled by the deadline for this story . ) <p> Aside from the issue of fairness and the sweeping legal infractions , why should we care whether Title IX is tightened up ? <p> Women 's advocates argue that equalizing athletics will help in the larger " battle of the sexes , " specifically in the struggle women face in the corporate world . <p> " Girls who participate in sports are 92 percent less likely to get involved with drugs and 80 percent less likely to have an unwanted pregnancy , " said Mary Duffy , editor of Women 's Sports &; Fitness Magazine . <p> " I would think everyone in society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IX mandates that : <p> ' No person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance .
