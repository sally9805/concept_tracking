<p> WEIGH THE FACTS <p> Despite the comfort of merely accepting the ' promotional ' efforts of Denver-based media , government officials and the tax-friendly chambers of commerce , voters should carefully study the pro and con arguments related to Referendum A. <p> The ' Blue Book ' issued by the Legislative Council points out the benefits and disadvantages of the proposal . Of note and concern to taxpayers are the reality checks detailed in the pamphlet , i.e. , the bond issue may prove to be more costly , rather than less costly than a ' pay as you go ' strategy ; the number of projects completed will likely be fewer under the accelerated payment mode vs. the traditional mode . Finally , Colorado 's existing roads are in poor condition despite nearly $ 1 billion in annual Department of Transportation funding . It is likely that the addition of new highway mileage will further exacerbate the problem as the annual cost of maintenance will , logically , increase . The result - even more poorly maintained roads . <p> Voters , especially those living outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the hype , regarding Referendum A. <p> STEVE RUSSELL <p> Broomfield <p> STUDY OPTIONS <p> A downside of Referendum A , the governor 's road program , is its potential to drive inflation of road construction materials . Thirteen highway projects costing more than a half billion dollars will be started in 2000 , generating enormous demand for construction materials , negatively impacting local road projects . <p> Roads also need serious maintenance/replacement every 20 years . Much of the governor 's bond money will reconstruct existing roads and interchanges . Widening roads means that in another 20 years we will be coughing up more billions of dollars for maintenance . <p> Urban and rural transportation needs are different . Areas now choked with congestion as along the Front Range have the population densities to support mass transit . If we pass Referendum A , we lose flexibility in our transportation options . <p> NANCY YORK <p> Fort Collins <p> DOES N'T ADD UP <p> Before any of us votes for Referendum A in November , here 's a few things to think about . <p> If we pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where will we come up with the money to pay for future projects ? Will we again have to sell more notes to pay for projects 15 years down the road ? <p> Why ca n't we simply use the state 's revenue surplus , or at least part of it , to fund these projects ? If our roads will still be as congested when the projects are complete , why not look at alternatives ? It seems like we 're planning to build a third bedroom , into a two-bedroom house , for a family of 10 . The math does n't add up , does it ? <p> MICHAEL MACK <p> Aurora <p> SOLVE NEEDS <p> I hope voters throughout the Western Slope will join me in supporting the TRANS bond Referendum A on Nov. 2 . <p> Support for the question ( and the companion RTD bonds ) will enable the state to finance construction of badly needed transportation projects both along the Front Range and on the Western Slope . The TRANS bonds accelerate important projects throughout the state and the RTD bonds provide an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Together , the proposals may save taxpayer money in the long run by building both projects at the same time . The Pitkin County Board of Commissioners , Club 20 and the Statewide Transportation Advisory Committee have endorsed resolutions for TRANS and RTD bonds . <p> MICK IRELAND <p> Pitkin County <p> The writer is chairman of Intermountain Transportation Planning Region . <p> SAFETY FOR BUSES <p> Colorado school districts have more of an investment in the infrastructure of our state 's transportation system than an individual would initially assume . According to information compiled by the Colorado Department of Education , school districts spend approximately $ 105 million annually to transport more than 300,000 children who travel 56 million miles between school and home . <p> Colorado school districts are among the major benefactors of our state 's system of roads and highways . It is primarily for this reason that the governing board of the Colorado Association of School Executives decided to support Referendum A. <p> STEVEN J. PRATT <p> Englewood <p> The writer is executive director of the Colorado Association of School Executives . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the West . Even bus systems have failed to live up to expectations . RTD currently carries less than 2 percent of the total commuters . One-third of that is 16th Street Mall riders . Buses are mobile and would be a better investment for taxpayers . Buses are quicker and more convenient for riders . <p> The best rail system in the country ( which is in Boston ) , carries only one-half of 1 percent of the total commuters that is 1 in 200 commuters . The light-rail proponents would have you believe that it will help congestion . It will not . It has failed in other cities and would be nothing more than a multibillion-dollar tax drain here . <p> SARAH GEVING <p> Parker <p> LATEST BOONDOGGLE <p> Apparently , no city in the western part of the United States that has built light rail has also maintained or improved service to existing bus riders . If ballot Referendum 4A passes , RTD management and board will quickly turn their attention to building the new , romantic light rail . <p> Of course , RTD will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority and your concerns about service have nothing to do with the billions of new taxpayer funds for light rail . <p> RTD will rush to wherever the gold is . As a bus rider , where do you think that will leave you in the scheme of things ? Do n't be fooled by RTD 's latest boondoggle . Save yourself lots of time and money , and vote no on light rail . <p> CLYDE HARKINS <p> Arvada <p> ACT IN UNITY <p> May I suggest two initiatives that will stop all this ignorant dog-fighting within RTD , which is directed by the taxpayers to bring forth a superior transportation system for our future ? <p> 1 . Pass a state referendum that will not allow the state Legislature to dictate public transportation issues . If it were not for all the politics we would not have to put up with the mess we now have with ' privatization ' and we would have light rail to DIA . <p> 2 . The RTD board needs to clean up its own act by passing a measure that will require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge or experience in the field . <p> If we do n't act in unity and strength , as a community , to promote mass transit in our future , we will be nothing more than one dirty , jammed-up mess . We already have a superior bus system in the city , minus the ' privatization problems ' and now all we need is a mass rail system to act as feeders to the buses . <p> JIM MOFFETT <p> Denver <p> PARENTS TEACH RIGHT AND WRONG ; CHILDREN CHOOSE THEIR ACTIONS <p> Is it just me , or has it occurred to others that it does n't matter what security measures we take to keep the bad people out of our schools , if in fact , they are supposed to be there in the first place ? <p> I read in the Oct. 16 paper that Highlands Ranch is looking to install a new card-key system . Why ? All of the students will have access as they should . What deterrent is there to one or more of the students that may carry a concealed weapon into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all entrances , maybe strip-search kids randomly everyday ? What is missing is a serious lack of respect on the part of children these days . Growing up , I can not remember a single incident involving kids bringing guns to school , shooting at each other or killing and maiming others . Parents need to have every lateral option available to raising children . When they are worried about legal action being taken against them for punishing their child , it would be a lot easier to just let things go and not punish . Where is the lesson here ? <p> If parents are to be held responsible for their children 's actions , then parents need to be able to use any resource available to them and raise their kids as they see fit . <p> When I was growing up , I did a lot of things that I should n't have . My mother and father had nothing to do with that . <p> They taught me right from wrong , I chose to do the things I did . <p> WILLIE WINDOM <p> Aurora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters need to seriously consider the leadership qualities of our next U.S. president ; charm , fame and wealth are not among those qualities . I came across a noteworthy quote in my Lutheran Women In Mission newsletter : ' A good leader is one who knows the way , goes the way and shows the way . ' <p> GAIL KIRKEGAARD <p> Lakewood
