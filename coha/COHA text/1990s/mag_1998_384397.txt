If you 're not getting the body or the performance you want , maybe it 's time to push yourself a little more <p> YOU KNOW WHEN YOU NEED more food  --  your stomach sounds like it 's digesting the souls of the damned . You know when you need more sex  --  pretty much all of the time . But do you know when you need a more strenuous workout ? Your body does n't have exercise pangs the way it has food cravings , and there 's no fitness version of horniness . <p> There is , however , an unofficial law of exercise science : " If you do what you 've always done , you get what you 've always gotten , " says New York City-based trainer Alwyn Cosgrove , C.S.C.S. So go ahead and pat yourself on the back for the regular workout schedule you keep . <p> At the same time , do n't you wonder if you could n't work a little harder ? If you could n't have a better body and get more of a health payoff by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't wonder anymore . The answers are yes , and yes . All the things you want from exercise that you do n't yet have  --  a better body , lower cholesterol and blood pressure , women who do n't care what kind of car you drive  --  will come only from pushing yourself just a little bit harder . <p> And do n't worry ; you do n't have to set up a cot at your local health club . You just need to learn how to pack more into your current workouts . Here 's how . Aerobics It 's time to work a little harder when ... <p> You 've been running , cycling , or skating the exact same route for more than a month . <p> You 've never tried to finish your regular route any faster . <p> Either you do n't monitor your heart rate , or you do and find that most of your effort is below 70 percent of your maximum heart rate . ( See " Get to Know Max , " page 110 . ) <p> You choose running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entry forms for local races , but never compete in them . Why do it ? <p> Research from the National Runners ' Health Study , published earlier this year , looked at 8,283 male runners and found that there 's a linear progression between miles run each week and health benefits . The farther the men ran , the better their supply of HDL cholesterol ( the stuff that takes fat out of your bloodstream before it can hurt you ) and the lower their overall risk of heart disease . The study also found that the runners who ran a 10-K distance fastest had lower blood pressure and smaller waistlines than those who ran the same distance more slowly . <p> Although the research looked at running , the author of the study thinks it applies to all aerobic activities . " Running is sustained and vigorous , so I suspect other forms of sustained , vigorous exercise would have the same benefit , " says Paul Williams , Ph.D. , an exercise researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley , California . How to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratchet up your intensity level is to start with a goal : running a 10-K , or maybe just keeping up with some fleet co-workers on their lunchtime jogs . The key is to pick a goal you ca n't just go out and do tomorrow . <p> Next , you need a program . " The single best way to build endurance is to train steady-state , " or at a constant level of effort , says exercise physiologist Richard L. Brown , Ph.D. , author of The 10-Minute LEAP and a trainer who has worked with athletes at all levels , from high school to the Olympics . <p> For an elite distance athlete , that ideal constant level might be 85 percent of his maximum . For you , it might be 70 to 80 percent . The goal here is to close in on your " lactate threshold , " the point at which your body can no longer meet its demand for oxygen and starts producing lactic acid as a way to punish you for stepping beyond your aerobic capabilities . You know the feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles that , if you keep pushing yourself , can start to feel like an infestation of fire ants . <p> Let 's say you usually run for 30 minutes , and you normally spend 5 of those at your ideal level . Push up the time you spend at your ideal level by 2 minutes a week for eight weeks , without increasing the total time spent running . You 'll run faster and farther in the same amount of time . <p> " When you train , you should feel challenged but in control , " Brown says . " You 're not just slogging through it , but you 're not pushing yourself so hard that you 're hammered . " <p> And there 's a big advantage to training near your lactate threshold without going over it : You can train almost every day , since your body needs just 24 hours to recover between workouts . If you go past your lactate threshold  --  during interval training , for example , which we describe next  --  you 'll generally need 48 hours to recover . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about speed , you 'll have to set aside training days to do just that . Here are a few techniques you can try : <p> Intervals : Fitness consultant and lecturer Douglas Brooks suggests this once-a-week interval workout ( the example used is running , but it can be applied to any aerobic activity ) : <p> Set off jogging at a comfortable pace-maybe 60 percent of your maximum heart rate . ( You 'll need a heart-rate monitor , so if you do n't have one , drop $40 at the local sporting-goods store . Your heart is worth the investment . ) <p> Increase your effort for 2 minutes . <p> Slow down to the initial pace for 2 minutes . <p> Repeat this speed/recovery cycle 5 to 10 times . As you get used to this , push yourself even harder during a shortened speed interval , and give yourself a little more recovery time before the next one . For example , push yourself hard for 1 minute , then recover for 3 minutes . <p> When you get used to that cycle , decrease the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superhard effort with 2 minutes of recovery . <p> When you exceed 85 percent of your maximum effort ( that is , go past your lactate threshold ) during any of these intervals , stick to a total of 5 to 10 minutes per workout at that intensity . Too much time at that level is very stressful , leading to more injuries and soreness , warns Edmund Burke , Ph.D. , editor of Precision Heart Rate Training . And , as we mentioned before , give yourself 48 hours to recover from any workout in which you go beyond your lactate threshold . <p> Hills : Taking on a few hills in your running program gives you a big benefit that you do n't get on level ground . " Running uphill calls upon more of the musculature and helps you develop more fast-twitch muscles , " says Burke . More muscle helps you in two ways : You burn more calories throughout the day , and the muscles in question grow stronger , meaning they 'll have more horsepower when it really matters . ( Fleeing reality , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pick a gentle to moderate slope that 's about one-quarter mile to half a mile from top to bottom . Run the hill two to five times , depending on your fitness level . But do n't tear up the hill as fast as you can . The object is n't to treat this as an interval workout and go anaerobic . You 're trying to build activity-specific leg strength , not launch your body into hyperspace . <p> Cutdowns : This is an interval technique , but it 's a little tougher than simply going hard for a minute or two at a time . You repeat a distance three times , going a little faster each time . For example , if you were running , you might choose to run a 200-meter distance . Run one fairly hard , the jog one ; run the next one a little faster , then job again ; the run the third one even faster . Recover for a couple of minutes at the jogging pace , then do the drill again . If you 're training for a race like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the last week or two before the competition . If you 're not training for a race , you can use it as a challenging alternative to whatever speed drills you normally do . ( On a bike , 200 to 500 meters is a good cutdown distance . ) Muscle It 's time to work a little harder when ... <p> You 've been doing the exact same workout for more than a month  --  same exercise , same order , same system of sets and repetitions/ <p> You have n't used heavier eights on any of your exercises in a month or more . <p> You never lift weights that are more than 85 percent of the maximum you could lift one time with good form . ( The easiest way to measure your one-repetition maximum is to simply do one-repetition sets of an exercise with ever-heavier weights until you get to a weight you ca n't lift . Now press your calculator , and figure how much weight you need to really push yourself . ) <p> You can carry on a conversation during a bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you do n't need one . <p> You never feel a pang of anxiety before a set , because you know you 'll have no problem finishing it . Why do it ? <p> " Intensity is one of the primary signals that causes the body to grow larger and stronger , " says Ellington Darden , Ph.D. , author of A Flat Stomach ASAP and 40 other fitness books . " You 've got to overload the body with heavier and heavier resistance . " How to do it : <p> FINISH WHAT YOU START . A perfect set should end when your muscles absolutely , positively ca n't lift the weight again with good technique . Yet almost no one in the gym really trains that intensely , says Darden . " People confuse intensity with amount , " he says . " They may do three sets of 8 repetitions , but not one of those reps is the last one they can do . " <p> Ideally , the end of that perfect set should come after 6 to 12 repetitions , and each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 to 4 seconds down ) and with strict form . <p> The next time you 're in the gym , try not to end any of your sets ( except warmups ) by stopping when you 've reached a predetermined number of repetitions . Keep going until you ca n't do another , even if it means doing 15 to 20 repetitions , or more . Your last rep should feel completely different from the first . <p> GO HEAVY . The one foolproof way to build more muscle is to life more weight . But lifting a lot of weight without a good plan is also a foolproof way to get hurt . Here are a few techniques to help you lift more without providing a lavish Christmas for some orthopedist 's children . You do n't need to do any of these things every time you go to the gym . You might try one of them every third or fourth workout , suggests Bob Lefavi , Ph.D. , C.S.C.S. , an exercise physiologist at Armstrong Atlantic State University in Savannah , Georgia . <p> Cut the repetitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more weight on the 5 than you could on the 8 ) . <p> Recruit a seasoned spotter and do negative repetitions ( he helps you lift a weight that 's heavier than you could ordinarily handle , and you try to control the weight 's descent ) . <p> Perform forced repetitions ( at the end of a set , a spotter helps you eke out 2 or 3 more repetitions after your muscles ca n't do any more on their own ) . <p> GO HEAVY-TO-LIGHT . One of the best , and least-used , muscle-building systems is the heavy-to-light system , or reverse pyramid , says University of Mississippi exercise researcher Len Kravitz , Ph.D . In a normal pyramid , a lifter might start with a set of 12 repetitions using a light weight , then do a set of 8 using a heavier one , then a set of 5 or 6 using still more weight , then a set of 3 or 4 using the heaviest weight possible . <p> That 's a good way to safely move a lot of iron , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles are exhausted . After a thorough warmup , the reverse pyramid starts with your heaviest weight a few repetitions , then a lighter weight for a few more repetitions , and so on until you finish with approximately 12 repetitions using the lightest weight you 'd use . Your muscles push or pull the heaviest weights when they 're freshest , and thus move more weight or do more repetitions than they would if they were exhausted . Thus , they grow bigger . <p> Try this technique for two to four weeks , a few times a year . <p> BUT SOMETIMES , JUST GO LIGHT . If you normally use heavy weight and do 8 to 10 repetitions per set , occasionally switch to lighter weights and 15 to 20 repetitions . " It 's a whole different way to work your muscles , " Lefavi says . You 'll be absolutely astounded at how tired and sore your muscles will get from using weights you thought were too puny to bother with . <p> PUT ON A VARIETY SHOW . " When you go into the gym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am barred from doing the same old thing . ' " Here are three smart ways to change around your program today : <p> If you normally do cardiovascular exercise before weight training , do it afterward instead , Lefavi suggests . Or , if you normally do it afterward , do it before . That way , your body learns to work through different levels of fatigue-sometimes having to do weight work when exhausted from cardio exercise , sometimes having to do cardio when exhausted from the weights . <p> " Stay out of the rut of doing the same exercises all the time , " says Richard Cotton , a spokesman for the American Council on Exercise . " If you do a biceps curl one way one day , do it another way the next time you work out . " You 'll involve different fibers , or the same fibers in a different range of motion , and your muscles will find a new reason to grow . <p> " Switch around the order of exercises , which most people do n't do , " Lefavi suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do the flys first one day ( a technique called pre-exhaustion ) . If you normally do arm exercises after you work your back and chest , one day do it in the opposite order . Try doing your entire workout backward one day . Now back off , mister <p> " Every four to six weeks , take a week where your training volume and intensity are no more than half what they were in your toughest week , " suggests Marc Evans , author of Endurance Athlete 's Edge . Make sure there 's no structure to what you 're doing . Jog if you feel like it , do light weight workouts if you want to . Hike , swim , or lust spend time with your family . Pick something that wo n't make you tired or sore . " Your body adapts only to the amount of stress and rest that you get , " Evans says , and these two things must be carefully balanced . " Without rest , you 're training into oblivion . " Get to Know Max CALCULATE YOUR IDEAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're working hard enough , you 're going to have to check with an expert : your heart . A simple calculation  --  220 minus your age  --  will tell you your approximate maximum beats per minute while exercising . During a workout , measure your pulse with your fingertips for 6 seconds , then multiply by 10 to get beats per minute . Or buy a heart-rate monitor and skip the math . Either way , if you train at 60 to 90 percent of your max , you 're probably getting good results from your workout . <p> But it makes a difference how you calculate your percentages ; the standard equation is n't particularly accurate . The 220-minus-your-age figure could be off your real maximum by as much as 12 beats per minute in either direction . And that 's a swing that might make Tarzan nervous . <p> A more dependable method , and one that 's correspondingly more labor-intensive , is measuring your heart-rate reserve . This formula includes your resting heart rate ( RHR ) , a key indicator of your fitness level . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wake up in the morning . ( Just to make it even more complicated , you should probably measure your RHR three consecutive mornings and take the average . A lot of factors  --  stress , a hard workout the day before , incredibly great sex  --  can temporarily elevate it . ) <p> Let 's say you 're a reasonably fit 35-year-old guy with an RHR of 80 . To calculate your heart-rate reserve , subtract your age from your predicted maximum heart rate ( 220 minus 35 , or 185 ) . Subtract your RHR from that figure ( 185 minus 80 , or 105 ) . Multiply that number by the top intensity at which you might train  --  85 percent  --  and you get 8g . Add your resting heart rate and you get 169 beats per minute at 85 percent of maximum intensity . Standard heart-rate calculations would have told you 85 percent of maximum effort was 157 beats per minute , or 12 fewer .  --  Lou Schuler <p> Hard Ware SEVEN PIECES OF EQUIPMENT GUARANTEED TO MAKE YOUR WORKOUT TOUGHER <p> A LOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your workout easier , allowing you to sit comfortably while you work one muscle group at a time . The stuff described here does the opposite , according to our experts . It forces you to work the most muscle through the greatest and most challenging ranges of motion . Do n't use it all ' in the same workout , but you 'd do well to try at least one each time you hit the gym . <p> SQUAT RACK A squat with a barbell uses 244 muscles , according to Bob Lefavi , Ph.D . The quadriceps , hamstrings and gluteals are the prime movers , and many additional muscles work as stabilizers : the trapezius , abdominals , lower back , rear deltoids , pectorals , even the small muscles around the ankle . ( In contrast , the knee-extension machine requires you to use fewer than 20 percent of those muscles . ) <p> VERSACLIMBER This is " real-man equipment , " says Edmund Burke , Ph.D . The VersaClimber forces you to climb hard with your legs as you simultaneously and independently pull yourself up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  arms , chest , shoulders , back , hips , legs  --  and produces both strength and endurance gains . If you can traverse this machine at 1.5 mph , you 'll burn 20 percent more calories per hour than you would running 7.5 mph . If you can go long enough , you 'll get a stunning cardio workout , too . <p> CLIMBING WALL Do n't have access to a VersaClimber ? Try a rock-climbing wall  --  same action , but an even higher level of difficulty , given the unpredictability of the terrain . You 'll strain for handholds , with the perceived threat of a fall . And that 's motivation to work harder . <p> CROSS-COUNTRY SKI MACHINE A couple of studies have found that cross-country skiing burns more calories , produces greater cardiovascular endurance , and causes participants to lose more weight , inches and body fat than virtually any other form of exercise . You can get similar benefits from working out on ski machines , like the NordicTrack . <p> PULLUP BAR The pullup uses more muscles  --  about 80  --  than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of motion . The only drawback is that few of us can do enough pullups to get a thorough back workout . That 's where assisted-pullup machines , like the Gravitron , come in handy . You can program it to let you lift as much of your body weight as you can handle  --  90 percent , 50 percent , whatever  --  and still get all the benefits of the exercise . <p> CONCEPT II ROWING MACHINE The Concept II is the closest you 'll get to real rowing without joining a crew . You 'll work the same muscles  --  thighs , upper back , trunk , arms  --  building endurance in those muscles , as well as achieving cardiovascular fitness . <p> STEPMILL This stairclimbing machine from StairMaster ( it was formerly called the Gauntlet ) is kind of like your career : a " down " escalator that you keep trying to walk up , and you never get anywhere . It 's harder than the usual stair machines , because you ca n't cheat with tiny steps .
