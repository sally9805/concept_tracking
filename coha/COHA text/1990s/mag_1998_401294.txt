A major poaching ring is uncovered in Florida The stench of blood and scorched hair mingled with the early morning mist as officers of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish ( Commission ( CFC ) crawled through the carnage like an army of picnic-crazed ants . Going about the grisly task of evidence collection , the men wrestled half-butchered animal parts out of cold storage . The raid had been a major success , but it was just a single battle in America 's on-going war against poachers . The bust  --  which took place on December 8 , 1997 , in La Belle , Fla. , located about halfway between Lake Okeechobee and the Gulf Coast city of Fort Meyers-was the culmination of " Operation Brooklyn ; " which had been set in motion thanks to an anonymous tt+ a member of the National : Turkey Federation had witnessed illegal hunting activity in South Florida Operation Brooklyn bore fruit with the first wave of arrests , which resulted in 40 charges  --  14 felonies and 26 misdemeanors  --  filed against nine individuals from Hendry County . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild turkeys , whitetail deer , opossums , ducks and other wild-life , including armadillos . The animals were processed in Florida and then delivered by truck to buyers in Brooklyn , N.Y. , for resale . Photograph Photograph News from around the sporting world // In order to make the bust , wildlife officers had managed to get a " mole " inside the ring . To gain the confidence of the poachers , a GFC undercover agent began selling legal animals to one Carl Boodhai of La Belle in October 1996 . " There were two initial transactions with legal animals-armadillos and hogs , " the agent says . " On the third trip , Boodhai asked me about supplying deer , turkeys and other species . " When the agent began selling deer to them , " Boodhai boasted that he had 40 to 50 people supplying meat and that he had supported his family on the sale of wildlife . " So brazen was Boodhai 's operation that he even handed out business cards that read , " Specializing in meats and wild game . " Records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illegal business for about four years . Wildlife officials estimate that , in 1997 alone , more than 200 deer were slaughtered and trucked to Brooklyn . At that time , Boodhai was paying $65 for a deer in Florida and reselling it in New York for $280 . Raccoons , opossums and armadillos were bought for $5 each and resold in Brooklyn for $30 to $40 . Boodhai was making one or two trips north per month and clearing an estimated $1,500 to $2,000 profit per run . In the course of the investigation , the GFC law enforcement division introduced several legally taken Osceola wild turkeys-donated by local NWTF members-into the poaching ring to create a chain of evidence . An undercover agent even managed to become friends with the ringleader to the extent that , in early April 1997 , about a week before one of Boodhai 's trips to Brooklyn , the agent moved a trailer onto the suspect 's property , right next to the growing gut pile . From this vantage point , the agent could identify local suppliers who were illegally selling game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in seven deer in one night , " says the agent . When the suspects prepared to move the illegal and poached game across state lines , wildlife officials brought in a second covert agent as backup . On Friday , April 17 , both undercover agents helped pack two trucks with 3,000 pounds of meat . Once loaded , the trucks made the trip from La Belle to Brooklyn , nonstop . On arriving in New York City , Boodhai and friends made the rounds of what appeared to be their regular customers . " We got to New York about 6:30 p.m. and began making stops at several residential homes and small grocery stores owned by East Indian merchants , " one of the agents says . " We sold meat until midnight , then drove straight back Sunday morning . " Despite the eyewitness accounts of the two undercover agents , it took eight more months to amass the required evidence that culminated in the early December raid .
