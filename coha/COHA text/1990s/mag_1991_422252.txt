<p> The use of online information services has been growing as more and more Americans purchase computers for their homes , to help with household tasks , for entertainment , or for business purposes . Accessed through a modem and a standard IBM or Macintosh type computer , online services provide consumers with all manner of features , including home shopping , travel booking , electronic news , sports , stock quote retrieval , and computer games . <p> Such services have proliferated in just the past two or three years , offering more sophisticated features and greater ease of use . Prodigy , a joint effort of Sears Roebuck Inc. and IBM , is probably the best known of the new entrants into online services . But old standbys such as GEnie and CompuServe still claim millions of loyal users , drawn by their many " conferences " . and bulging electronic libraries of software . <p> All the popular services offer certain standard features for a fixed monthly cost or a charge based on time usage . These services can be used to do everything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they are all usually a local call away . <p> Beyond the commercial entrants , however , is a thriving cottage industry among hometown hackers who set up and maintain their own computer " bulletin boards . " Often free or for small donations , users can exchange messages with one another , send and receive software , and make new friends at the same time . <p> This article will review the major online services and local bulletin boards , discussing their services , ease of use , and fees . Prodigy <p> The Prodigy Service , begun in 1988 , is unlike other online services in its purpose and nature . Rather than featuring conversation and file exchanges among users , Prodigy is designed to be more of a video magazine , complete with all the dazzle , temptations , eye-catching graphics , and requisite sales pitches . <p> The service runs best when used with a computer with a hard disk , but will run on a floppy disk-based system . Monochrome monitors equipped with a graphics adapter , such as an EGA or Hercules-type graphics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual appeal . Prodigy comes with its own ingenious software , which may be installed onto the user 's hard disk easily . The service 's greatest selling point is its ease of use , especially if your computer is equipped with a mouse , which allows you simply to point at desired commands and click a button . <p> Prodigy is partially financed by advertising dollars ; ads for various products and services appear on the screen while you are looking around . Mostly , the ads do not interfere with whatever you are doing on the service , and the graphics are usually pleasing without being an unbearable distraction . <p> Large catalogs , such as Spiegel Co. , and specialty catalogs , such as Austad 's ( golf items ) , pay Prodigy to be represented here . Prodigy users can order items from those catalogs directly from their computer with a credit card , much the same as calling the company directly and placing the order , except that your address is already filled in , unless you specify a different address . Turnaround time for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of Cruise packages . You can leave a message for the travel agency to provide additional information on departures and fees . The agency will later post the information in your file . <p> You may not want to provide your phone number when responding to an ad on Prodigy , if you want to avoid telephone solicitations from the advertiser . <p> Beyond the merchandising , though , there are many other diversions available on Prodigy . There are fantasy league sports games , online games such as the popular " Carmen Sandiego " series , a searchable encyclopedia , recipes , latest news and sports , etc . <p> Users may also send up to 30 messages per month to one another without extra charge , provided they know the other user 's ID number . <p> Users can also retrieve a national weather map , or get more localized information , including a three-day local forecast . Or they can get results of sporting events , including partial reports on games in progress . <p> There is even a feature through which you can have the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing you to customize your use of Prodigy . <p> The only thing lacking on the Prodigy Service is a library of computer files that may be " downloaded " by users . This is not the service 's purpose , though , and there are many other services which do a great job providing just that . <p> Prodigy has received some bad press in recent months for two alleged transgressions . First , users have complained that messages sent between users that criticized the service were deleted by the system 's operators . Prodigy officials have said that they do not read the messages posted by users , only that their computers scan them for certain words , and that they are ultimately responsible for what is on their system . <p> The service has also been the subject of controversy over an apparent curiosity in its software . Once installed on a user 's hard disk drive , the software creates a large file ( 900 kilobytes ) called STAGE.DAT . Its purpose , note Prodigy officials , is to store many of the basic screen images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prodigy speeds the transmission of data by triggering basic images already stored on the user 's hard disk . A map of the United States , for instance , is stored on your hard disk , with only the latest weather information sent over the wire . <p> But angry users have charged that the file is storing much more than harmless images-that it is finding and saving personal information on the user . A Prodigy spokesman denied that the software was purposely gathering personal information , or that the personal information users have found in the file was in any way being transmitted back to Prodigy . <p> The Prodigy software , according to the company , simply grabs unclaimed space on the hard disk to store images . When a file is deleted from a DOS-based hard disk , the information it contained is not immediately purged from the disk . Rather , the physical disk space formerly used by the file or files is made available for new files written to disk . Depending on how often a user adds , changes , or erases files from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " files may remain on the disk for months . This handy feature allows users to reclaim files that they erased accidentally , provided they do so before the space the file occupied is claimed by a more recent file . <p> In any case , Prodigy now offers a utility program to those who ask that will erase any personal information stored in the Prodigy STAGE.DAT file . <p> Cost . Unlike most other services , Prodigy bills customers a flat monthly fee to use the service . There are some options , but almost everything is included in the standard fee , currently $12.95 a month ( $8.33 per month when you pay for 24 months in advance ) . That is attractive for many users , especially for those using 1200 baud modems , which are half as fast as the more common 2400 baud models . There is a tendency on the hourly-priced services to feel rushed . The meter is running , so you must get on , get what you want , and get off . Prodigy 's flat fee makes you want to linger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest of the large online providers , CompuServe is still the most popular . Owned by H &R; Block Inc. , CompuServe caters to the more dedicated computer user . While lacking the slick pictures and graphics that have made Prodigy so quickly popular , CompuServe offers its members more substance . <p> Perhaps feeling the pinch from Prodigy , CompuServe has upgraded the quality of its presentation , even as its content has grown steadily . The services available on CompuServe are as good as their nearest counterparts on Prodigy , yet CompuServe offers vastly more of what it specializes in . <p> CompuServe also provides its own software for accessing the service , but it is not required . The software , called CompuServe Information Manager , is not nearly as easy to pick up or use as Prodigy . New users may have to refer to the manual frequently for instructions on how it works . <p> A specialty of CompuServe is its many computer discussion groups , dedicated to discussion of everything from aquarium fish , science fiction , sailing , and genealogy , to working at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A greater draw still are the message areas sponsored by software and hardware manufacturers and run by their employees . All the major publishers of business software , such as Microsoft , Borland , Lotus , Ashton-Tate , WordPerfect , and Symantec , are represented here with forums that allow the user to write in his question and have it answered in a follow-up message . While such a service might not always beat having a support specialist on the other end of a telephone , it could be considerably cheaper than sitting on hold long distance waiting for a technician . <p> Like its competitors , CompuServe also offers news retrieval services and sports scores , updated periodically . But it also offers several databases for retrieving information , such as statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau , a family of special medical databases ( for use mainly by doctors and medical researchers ) , health information , U.S. State Department travel advisories , and a searchable database of newspapers and magazines , ranging from the common to the obscure . <p> Not only can a user get stock quotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others , he may also access financial information about a particular company before placing his order . <p> The quantity of services available through CompuServe far exceeds that of Prodigy , yet there is almost too much , even for an experienced user . There are so many things available , so many ways to use the service , that it can be intimidating . More than that , it can get expensive . <p> CompuServe also has shop-at-home services , like those on Prodigy , but they lack any visual appeal and you must know what you want before you shop . CompuServe waives the connect charges for users while they are using the " Electronic Mall " feature . <p> Cost . For most users , CompuServe will be more expensive per month than Prodigy . While Prodigy charges a flat monthly fee for unlimited access to its services , CompuServe charges a small minimum fee each month of $2 , then bills the user based on his monthly usage at a rate of $12.50 per hour for those using a 1200 or 2400 baud modem . CompuServe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning is simply that , at 9600 baud , you can do more in less time online . GEnie <p> This service , run by General Electric , is even less intuitive to use than CompuServe and requires some time to become familiar with its internal logic . Unlike Prodigy , GEnie requires no special software , only a standard communications program such as Procomm or Cross Talk ( see box , page 12 ) . <p> This is good in that it lets you sign on with your own familiar software , but it can be difficult if you are not comfortable with GEnie 's menu system , in which you select your choice from a list of options . There are short cuts to this , which you master by reading the manual the service sends to its users . The manual is straightforward and , mercifully , written in plain English . <p> Of all the services tested , GEnie was the least appealing visually . CompuServe at least has made some nods to recent improvements in computer equipment , such as including the option of using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not gotten that far , and , according to a spokesman , has no plans to do so . Software similar to CompuServe 's Information Manager is available , but you must download it from the service itself <p> GEnie most closely competes with CompuServe . It claims to have a larger library than CompuServe . There are not nearly as many electronic conferences as on CompuServe , though , so GEnie can not claim the breadth of its better known rival , even if it does keep more files around . <p> GEnie 's partisans are there mainly for two reasons : cost and files . Its library did seem more comprehensive , if not as well ordered as that of CompuServe , and was , like CompuServe 's , searchable by certain key words . <p> Services offered on GEnie include a searchable encyclopedia , brokerage services through Charles Schwab Inc. , and a wide variety of " Roundtables , " for users of particular software programs , as well as interests . These can be very rewarding , especially if you are having trouble with a program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . You may read or search for messages by topic , or enter one of your own and await a reply . Such services let you discuss your problems and help other GEnie users from around the nation . <p> One annoying trait of the GEnie Service , though , is the necessity to keep one hand poised over the " Control " and " S " keys while looking at a scrolling menu . You can stop the display at a certain point with the two keys . Then you have to press " Control-Q " to resume the mad dash across your monitor . <p> Cost . Not surprisingly , GEnie 's cost ranges below that of CompuServe for users who call after 6 p.m. during the week and on weekends . Fees are also geared to the services the user chooses . For a flat fee of $4.95 , users may use many of GEnie 's services without limit during evening and weekend hours . Other services , such as downloading software , start a meter are using such extras . Accessing GEnie during peak times ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . For example , reading through pages of messages in most of the conferences is covered under your monthly membership charge , but downloading software from the wide variety of software libraries is extra . With some knowledge of the system , GEnie users can dart in and out of the pay services to minimize the extras . And the service marks with an asterisk the menu choices that start the meter running . America Online <p> This service , from its location in Vienna , Va. , has served users of the Apple Macintosh for several years . It now serves IBM-type computers as well . Users receive and must use special software when accessing the system . The look of the software will be familiar to anyone who has used Microsoft Windows , and while Prodigy supports a mouse and high resolution monitor , America Online requires it . It uses objects on the screen to display choices to the user . <p> Installation of the software is easy , as is becoming familiar with and navigating around the system 's many options . Its graphics are slick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapier-thin and frequently difficult to read without squinting at the screen . <p> Once online , the service shows a range of choices , from an encyclopedia to news retrieval ( from UPI ) , as well as sports briefs and a limited software library that may be searched by category . The quality of the news service retrieval is below that of both Prodigy and CompuServe . <p> Like the others , America Online offers a range of conferences , geared to specific interest groups . Many of these conferences are live , however , rather than operating like the electronic mail systems used in many offices and the other commercial online services . <p> Software libraries are offered on America Online for IBM users , but they are not as comprehensive as its competitors ' . More software packages should be available for use with IBM-type computers . <p> Cost . America Online charges a fee of $5.95 per month , which includes the first hour of use . Time above that is billed at $5 per hour during evenings and weekends , and $10 per hour during business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulletin Board Systems <p> Perhaps the most interesting development to come out of the vast improvements in computer telecommunications is the privately run bulletin board system ( BBS ) . Burning up the phone lines in most of America 's cities these days is a vast network of computer users who carry on conversations , exchange tips and files , talk polities , and even find the girl of their dreams through electronic bulletin boards . Not only are these boards more friendly and relaxed than the pay services , but they also are far more economical for the casual user . <p> Most private BBSs are free , or nearly so . Many will ask users to help defray the costs of running the systems with an annual donation of from $5 to $50 . In general , donations cover the expenses of the system operator-or " Sysop "  --  rather than serving as a cash cow . <p> What do you get for nothing ? Many BBSs carry message conferences , both local and " echoed , " meaning shared among a network of bulletin boards across the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , with the noteworthy exception that it is frequently possible to search through hundreds of messages for certain key words , such as finding any messages within a database conference that mention " mailing lists . " <p> The quality of these conferences is spotty , however . Sometimes there are knowledgeable people who participate and offer their advice and wisdom freely . Just as often a question placed as a message will go unanswered for days , even weeks . Local board conferences rely on the combined expertise of participating users , most of whom are participating to have a question answered , rather than solve one for someone else . Still , there are lots of computer users who have learned as much or more about certain tasks on the computer as those who sell or support the software . <p> The greatest challenge in participating in local BBSs , though , can be in finding them . Some areas have very active networks , while others have only a few . Most often , you will find out about one BBS by seeing a message advertising it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give another board a try . <p> Most boards maintain active file directories filled with " shareware , " public domain games , utility programs , add-ons for commercial software , text files , and nearly anything else that can be stored in a computer . ( See box , page 15 . ) <p> The better system operators will cull the files sent by users of the system , discarding either older versions of existing software , " pirated " commercial software , or files containing a dreaded computer virus or " Trojan horse . " ( See box , page 16 . ) <p> Bulletin board systems have grown up in the past few years as well . There are now dozens of , " superboards " around the nation , such as Channel 1 in Massachusetts , EXEC-PC in Wisconsin , and Rusty &; Edie 's in Ohio . These boards , probably begun on a small scale with just a few local users , have grown into giants , with impressive collections of files ; they draw callers from all over the country . As the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer new shareware programs , sometimes before CompuServe or GEnie . And , the superboards cost less than commercial online services , even after accounting for long distance phone charges usually needed to reach them . Where to Go for Information <p> You can contact the online services discussed in this article by calling the following numbers : TABLE <p> By Joseph R. Duffus <p> <p> Mr. Duffus is a writer and editor based in Washington , D.C. <p> COMPARATIVE COST OF ONLINE SERVICES Three Hours Usage Per Month ( Off-peak Hours ) TABLE Comparison By Hourly Use At 2400 Baud ( Off-peak Hours ) TABLE Includes one hour using extra services . Includes an average 30 minutes per hour using extra services . <p> SHAREWARE <p> The concept of shareware is one of the nicest innovations of the computer age . Many bulletin boards are part of the Association of Shareware Professionals , a publishing group that solicits and helps market software developed by itinerant or amateur software designers . <p> The idea works this way : Suppose you want to sample a spreadsheet program without paying several hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreadsheet programs available on bulletin boards which you may freely download and try . Most often , there will be an accompanying document explaining the program and giving its author 's address . <p> If you continue to use the program , you send a donation to the author , for which you will receive , free , any revisions or upgrades to the program or printed documentation of its functions . Not only small software writers , but also large manufacturers , will apply this concept . Public BBSs are frequently stocked with demo versions of commercial software , giving the consumer added choices and options . <p> VIRUSES AND TROJAN HORSES <p> Much has been written about the dreaded computer virus , and its nefarious companion , the Trojan Horse . <p> Briefly , a virus is a small , destructive program capable of replicating itself in other computers . ( A computer virus was blamed for a recent five-state crash of telephone service in the Northeast . ) Viruses are often found buried in Trojan Horses , innocent programs to which a virus has been added by evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is nonetheless real , and anyone participating in online services should be aware of it . <p> Most viruses will either surreptitiously issue a command to format your hard disk , thereby permanently deleting anything stored on it , or scramble your FAT . Your FAT is your " file allocation table , " an index used by your computer 's operating system to locate individual files on the hard disk . It works like an index , telling the disk , drive the physical location of your file on the disk . <p> Nearly all public bulletin boards these days have a system to prevent Trojan horses from getting into their systems . Many systems will automatically test a file immediately after it has been sent to the bulletin board , while others will not make a file available for any other user to download until it has been checked by the Sysop for such equine treachery . <p> Careful users of bulletin boards periodically will make back-up copies of their hard disks just in case they receive a virus , but everyone who owns a computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEED <p> To utilize the offerings of online services , you will need at a minimum a computer and a modem . <p> Computer Hardware . Many computers sold today are capable of working with commercial online services . Some services , however , such as Prodigy or America Online function better with color monitors , a hard disk drive , and a mouse . You should contact the online services for any special hardware requirements . <p> As to your computer 's display , most of the commercial services perform better , and look much better , if you are using a color monitor with a high resolution graphics adapter . VGA ( video graphics array ) is the standard these days , providing up to 256 colors simultaneously in resolution detailed enough to do justice to Impressionist paintings . <p> If you still operate an XT-type personal computer , with an amber or green monochrome monitor , most online services will still respect you . Prodigy and America Online will not , though . Although these services will work with monochrome monitors , they are designed with color and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . <p> Modem . A modem is a relatively inexpensive device that works like a telephone , allowing your computer to send and receive information through phone lines . Modems are connected to your computer either internally-as circuit boards that plug in to an expansion slot-or externally , patching into a plug found on the back of most computers sold today . Internal modems do everything their outboard cousins do , but are less expensive because there is no need for a case to enclose the circuitry . They are easily installed with nothing more complicated than a screwdriver . <p> Most modems sold today are capable of receiving and sending information at " 2400 baud . " Roughly translated , this works out to six single-spaced pages of text per minute . Still , faster modems are constantly being developed for more demanding applications , such as transmitting more and more complex graphic images . Modems that send at 9600 baud are increasingly used . <p> Cost varies with brand and speed . Most 2400 baud modems today sell for below $100 and are more than adequate for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modem-dial the phone numbers , save the information , and so forth-is also inexpensive . Procomm , for example , one of the most popular programs for running modems , can be purchased through discount stores for around $70 . If all you want to do is dial proprietary services such as Prodigy or CompuServe , though , you may not even need extra software . Many of the commercial services come with their own software , especially Prodigy , which requires it . <p> If you are considering upgrading or replacing your PC , consider the vast savings of purchasing an IBM " clone " rather than the latest offerings from Big Blue . This article was written and researched on a 286-class PC clone costing around $1,100 . That price , common through catalogs and many local dealers , included a 40-megabyte hard disk , 2400 baud modem , one megabyte of random access memory ( RAM ) , and a VGA graphics card and monitor . It suits most applications well and may be upgraded when needs and finances change . <p>       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
