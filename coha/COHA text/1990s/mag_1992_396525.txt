Elegant and doe-eyed , Olivia Hussey , at 40 , still looks the classic beauty she appeared almost 24 years ago in the movie Romeo and Juliet . But these days , clearly , she also has a non-Capulet side . The T-shirt , black leggings and high-top sneakers provide the first hints . Rounding out the non-Renaissance picture , there 's a large black Harley-Davidson parked in her Coldwater Canyon garage . Juliet on a Harley ? Indeed it 's been a long , bumpy ride for the actress since she was cast as the heroine in Franco Zeffirelli 's 1968 hit . The film turned Hussey , 16 , and her 17-year-old Romeo , Leonard Whiting , into instant stars . But the newfound celebrity proved to be overwhelming for both Whiting ( see page 60 ) and her . " We were thrown into this fishbowl , " she says . " You 're robbed of a whole chunk of your childhood , and nothing is real anymore . " In the years since her sensuous screen debut , Hussey has weathered the breakup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public places ) and the postdivorce death of Dean Paul Martin , her first husband and father of her elder son , Alex , 19 . For the past year she has also been waging a legal battle with longtime manager Jay Levy , 49 , whom she accuses of filching up to $1 million from her savings and pension fund and of engineering a secret $348,000 mortgage on the now $2 million home she bought four years ago . Last October , Hussey filed a more than $500,000 civil suit against Levy , who has been under investigation by the FBI . " I made two films two years ago , and that ( money ) never went into the bank , " she says . " I do n't know what happened to it . " Levy , who refuses to comment on her charges , is currently facing at least 11 other lawsuits from former clients . Several years ago he made an out-of-court settlement with comedians Tom and Dick Smothers after they accused him of fraud , breach of contract and negligence . But financial woes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocks . The first came at age 2 , when her parents , Argentine opera singer Andreas Osuna and legal secretary Joy Hussey , separated . Young Hussey was bundled off to England by her mother soon after . " She took her two children to England and took a big chance , " says Hussey admiringly of her mother . Put into drama school at age 4 , by the time she was 13 , Hussey was costarring with Vanessa Redgrave in the London stage production of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie . Zeffirelli caught her performance one night and asked her to audition for the role of Juliet . Said Zeffirelli at the time : " I chose her because she is life itself . " That life soon became less than carefree when the crush of publicity from the Shakespearean smash aggravated an already existing case of agoraphobia . Hussey left acting for two years , but though she avoided the public , she did n't lack for intimate companionship . In 1970 she married Dean Paul Martin , Dean Martin 's son , who , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to England after seeing Romeo and Juliet in a Hollywood theater . The marriage collapsed after three years because , says Hussey , " he had n't finished running around , and ( by then ) I was busy trying to work . " Too proud to demand money from Martin or his parents , Hussey struggled , and " at one point it got so tight that I was selling my own jewelry " to make ends meet , she recalls . " I thought I had failed . I had this beautiful child , and I was alone . " An introduction to yoga and Indian guru Swami Muktananda raised her spirits and eventually eased her agoraphobia . To this day she remains a devout follower . A second marriage followed , this time to Japanese singer Akira Fuse , whom she had met in Japan while filming a TV commercial . The union resulted in son Max , now 9 , but it too ended in divorce , in 1987 , when Akira decided that life in California was ruining his career in Japan . Just about then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had remained close , died in a plane crash . Shaken by the losses , Hussey abandoned acting again to be with her sons . Then in 1989 , she met her current live-in love , rocker David Glen Eisley , 37 , in Jerry 's Famous Deli , a Studio City watering hole . Eisley , who had seen Romeo and Juliet 50 times , went gaga at first glance . " As I was leaving , she smiled , and my hair stood on end , " he recalls . He rushed home and penned a ballad titled " Olivia " and sent a tape to Hussey through her agent . She called , and a romance ignited . Though the hard-rocking Eisley , whose last band was called Dirty White Boy , and the soft-spoken Hussey may seem star-crossed , Hussey defends her Romeo : " He may wear earrings and chains on his boots , but when he opens his mouth , he knows every line of Romeo and Juliet . " Thanks to her financial mess , Hussey , too , may soon be learning lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that really enjoys staying home with my children , " she says . " To be told you 've got to get to work , it is just unbelievable what it does to you . " Two years ago she played Norman Bates 's mother in Psycho IV : The Beginning and Richard Thomas 's wife in the TV miniseries It . But although she muses about playing someone " really bitchy and nasty , " the old innocence surfaces when she describes her ideal role . " One of my dreams , " says Hussey , " is to play Mother Teresa . " ... MEANWHILE , ROMEO DOES CAMEOS AND WRITES Question : O Romeo , Romeo ! Wherefore art thou , Romeo ? Answer : Living in a modest four-room Victorian row house in Camden Town , a slightly seedy district of London . For Leonard Whiting , now 41 , playing Romeo at 17 was the bright spot in a film career that quickly faded . " I was thrust for a long moment into international stardom , " he says . " When that happens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again . " Unhappy with the " moon in June " romance roles he was continually offered and with his lukewarm notices in such forgettable 1970s films as Say Hello to Yesterday and Rachel 's Man , Whiting turned to the typewriter . His complete  --  still unpublished  --  works include four novels , two fantasies for children , a full-length gangster musical and ( seven drafts later ) a sequel to the play that made him famous , Romeo and Juliet 2 , in which the lovers come back to life . Whiting 's brief , offscreen romance with Hussey during the filming of Romeo and Juliet still stands out in his memory , and he has kept in contact with his onetime costar . " She still looks wonderful , " he says , " only about two years older , whereas I look like Lord Capulet . " His own 1971 marriage to American model Cathee Dahmen ended after six years and one daughter , now 20 . These days , Whiting 's Juliet is live-in love Lynn Presser , 40 , also his manager . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lived mostly on film residuals ) , things may be looking up . Last year , Whiting did a voice-over for a British cartoon and even starred in Una Nova Primavera , a Brazilian-made art film . His passion , however , is to get backing for his R &J; sequel , which he calls " a cross between Shakespeare 's original and Chinatown . " Whiting is keeping mum about whether the impassioned pair live happily ever after , except to say , " they have their share of marital troubles . " <p>
