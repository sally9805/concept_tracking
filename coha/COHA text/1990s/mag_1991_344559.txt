Marcel Duchamp , the French Surrealist , labeled as " art " a battered bottle rack , a defaced poster of the Mona Lisa and a mass-produced urinal . He perceived art all around in the vernacular world . The question pondered in THE MYSTERIES , a multimedia enchantment at Harvard 's American Repertory Theater , is whether vernacular life itself  --  the life of mating , domestic squabbles and old age  --  can constitute a sort of art . At times the idea is posed literally , as when writer-director David Gordon places an ornate frame around actors engaged in a mock wedding . At other times the " mysteries " of creation are interspersed with the mysteries of , say , detective stories . The text is often witty , if declamatory , but the real joys of the piece are acoustic and visual . Philip Glass has contributed his customary pulsating music , which has the narcotic effect of nitrous oxide coupled with the distant hum of a dentist 's drill , yet is curiously pleasurable . Painter Red Grooms has designed the sets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both primitive and highly sophisticated .  --  W.A.H . III
