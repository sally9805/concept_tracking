// We drive a GMC Denali 4200 miles from the lowest point in America to its highest . We 're dead tired . Our butts are asleep . But at least they 're getting some sleep . Passengerseat naps , even while our vehicle hammers over the rutted Alaska Highway , is all the sleep we 've had in two days . Even the moose that comes rushing out of the brush and crosses right in front of our vehicle fails to stimulate any adrenaline flow . Maybe we 're dead . Maybe we should have run the route in reverse , and finished in the Funeral Mountains of Death Valley . No , this place is the proper end of the route . Death comes to Denali far more frequently than to the infamous desert that bears its name . Since 1932 , 87 climbers have died on the mountain , including three this season . One fatality comes on June 13-just a month before we arrive . So what the heck are we doing here ? We 're going to extremes to test man and machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more luxurious and more carlike , can they still cut it in the rough , over the long haul ? That 's what we wanted to know . GMC 's new Denali , an upscale version of the company 's full-size Yukon SUV , is the latest of these country club trucks to hit the street . We already knew the Yukon was tough . We proved it in our December 1991 issue as we drove a Yukon across its namesake province , from suthern Alberta to the Artic Circle ( see " To The Yukon In A Yukon , " page 38 ) . A 2741-mile trip . NJow it ws the Denali 's turn . Could this leather-lined luxomobile , this truck with a cellphone , CD player , power everything and chrome wheels , be driven from the lowest point in North America to the continent 's highest ? Would its drivetrain survive the desert heat and the radical changes in altitude ? Would its suspension collapse after days of pounding over the torturous Alaska Highway ? Would its tires shred like mozzarella on the off-road sections ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the road to find out . Photograph Photograph // Bye Low We begin in the Badwater Basin , the very bottom of Death Valley . Badwater is the lowest dry land in the Western Hemisphere-282 ft. below sea level . It 's an eerie place , completely void of life . Frozen rivers of salt-small blue-green pools rimmed with shiny crystaland fields of sharp pinnacles , called The Devil 's Golf Course , are all that 's left from the ancient lake that once covered this ground . The Devil 's Golf Course goes on as far as the eye can see . A small , choppy gravel road off state highway 178 takes us to the heart of this truly lunar landscape . The pinnacles surround us . Made of silty halite , they stand up to 2 ft. high . They are formed of the salt left behind from e evaporation of ground water . Rain and wind then trim the pinnacles , honing their tips razor-sharp . Death Valley , named in 1849 by a stranded wagon train of ' ' 49ers who barely made it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It covers 5264 square miles If eastern California and a small portion of Nevada . The midday temperature is a bone-dry 130F , but the Denali is running plenty cool . Far from a covered wagon , we 're driving a $43,495 truck loaded with life-saving amenities . If it were n't for the GMC 's deep-tinted glass and front and rear air conditioning , we would be the world 's largest slabs of beef jerky . But you have to be careful how you use such luxuries . In this environment , the Denali 's seat heaters could kill . The truck 's comfort , however , is not in question . It 's the Denali 's toughness we doubt . We 're worried that GMC designers have turned the dial too far toward the soccer mom setting . The tires , Firestone Firehawks are a serious concern . They look fragile , lacking any kind of off-road tread . We 're afraid they 'll pop like pimples on the Alaska Highway , notorious for eating tires . Just to be safe , we 've had GMC load up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard one mounted under the vehicle . Before we leave the hottest place on Earth , we decide to put the tires to the test . Allen 's new Delorme Tripmate GPS system , and laptop computer with AAA Map &; Go 4.0 and Delorme Street Atlas 5.0 mapping software find us a good , rough dirt road . The 50-mile route is flat enough for 2-wheel drive , but it 's very rocky . We 're sure the Denali 's tires will be carved up like the Florida Marlins after the ' ' 98 series . We 're wrong . We burst out of the desert onto state highway 374 dirty , but with all four tires still holding air . We enter Nevada with John Fogerty 's " Centerfield " in the CD player , pick up U.S. 95 at Beatty , Nev. , and head north . Although it 's out of the way , we ca n't resist a side trip down to Rachel , the closest town to Area 51 . At Tonopah , an old silver mining town and the site of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right and take U.S. 6 east for about 50 miles and then grab the " Extraterrestrial Highway , " or Nevada state highway 375 as it 's identified on maps , south toward Rachel . Photograph Photograph // Failing to find Klingon life , we backtrack and pick up state highway 376 northbound . This winds us through the Big Smokey Valley and the very heart of Nevada . Then , for a short time we hook up with state highway 50 , dubbed the " loneliest road in America . " North of Winnemucca , back on U.S. 95 north , we pass the Black Rock Desert , where the first supersonic land  --  speed record was set by the jet-powered Thrust II last year . And then , successfully having managed to completely avoid the gaming tables of Vegas and Reno , we cross into Oregon 's high desert . With its rocky coastline , Oregon is often thought to be a stark contrast to the dry land of Nevada , but the state 's thick forests lie further west , north of California , and closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idaho , re-enter a lush , green Oregon and pick up I-84/U.S. 30 , the Oregon Trail made famous by Lewis and Clark . We fly past exit 228 , marked Deadman 's Pass , without even a look . It 's not that we 're chicken . But after Death Valley , the Funeral Mountains , Dead Horse Canyon , the Devil 's Golf Course , Deadman Creek Dome , Devil 's Gate and , of course , Coffin Canyon , we 've just had enough of places so morbidly named . We cross Washington , and spend our only night in a hotel . We make it a good one , in downtown Seattle , up the street from the city 's trademark Space Needle . The Great Big White North Canada is big . Death Valley to Seattle , about a 1200-mile trip including our little search for alien life , was a snap . But the haul through British Columbia and the Yukon will prove tough . Alaska is waaay up there . From the Washington/Canada border to the Alaska/Canada border is close to 2000 miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We wo n't even reach the Alaska Highway for another 1200 miles . We cross into Canada on Route 37 , and turn up the wick . We push the Denali 's 255-hp 5.7-liter V8 hard . The 4-speed automatic downshifts constantly , finding us the power to pass or climb a grade . Still , the math says we 're averaging about 16 mpg . Not bad . That gas mileage and the Denali 's 29.5-gal. fuel tank give us a theoretical range of over 300 miles . Arithmetic aside , we 've been filling up every 250 miles or so-the range of our bladders . We stop in the paper mill town of Prince George for food , gas and a personal pitstop . Next stop : Houston , home of the World 's Largest Fishing Pole . The 60-ft.long structure weighs about 800 pounds and has a 36-in. - dia. reel . We ca n't pass it up . After that , it 's off to the twin towns of Stewart , British Columbia , and Hyder , Alaska . Stewart , at the mouth of the Bear River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just about two miles up the road , is home to only 100 . Hyder , once a thriving mining town of over 10,000 , is now a town without paved roads or even law enforcement . It does have the Glacier Inn , however , a watering hole famous for " Hyderizing " visitors with a wicked alcoholic concoction . We successfully avoid Hyderization , but we do strike up a conversation with Gary and Phyllis Gannon , a couple who have been successfully Hyderized . Their Eldorado wears Florida plates . They 've been on the road two full weeks . Our little trip fails to impress . Humbled in Hyder , we grab a bite at the King Edward Motel in Stewart , and get back on the road . Though we stopped in Hyder , the roads we need run through Canada , not Alaska . It 's after 10 pm , but it 's still light out , which fools our internal body clocks and keeps us going . We stop at the Bear Glacier and listen to it crackle . Chunks fall and float @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Night driving proves fatiguing . We do n't make Watson Lake , home to the world famous Sign Post Forest , until just after sunup . The forest was founded in 1942 by a homesick GI , Carl K. Lindley of Danville , Ill. , while working on the Alaska Highway . Lindley erected a sign here pointing the way and stating the I mileage to his hometown . Today , more than 30,000 signs from all over the world make up the forest . We could n't resist leaving a POPULAR MECHANICS license plate behind . The Alaska Highway Finally , we reach the road that will really put the Denali to the test . It 's pretty much a straight shot from here . We 'll be on the Alaska Highway for 600 miles all the way to the Alaskan border . Photograph Photograph // Quickly , we cross the Continental Divide and slip through Whitehorse , the capital of Yukon province , which is in the middle of a yearlong party celebrating the centennial of the Klondike Gold Rush . Every year , more and more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of gravel is now paved about 40% of the way . The way it 's paved , however , is odd . There 's no apparent rhyme or reason to it . We 'll travel 100 miles on gravel , and then 100 yards on asphalt . And then back to gravel . Sometimes it alternates rapidly , while sometimes the asphalt goes on for miles . Really strange is the fact that the gravel sections , for the most part , are smoother than the freshly paved portions . Right now , the cold rain has the gravel sections packed extra tight . But when it 's dry , the dust kicked up by the Denali and other vehicles completely hides the world , front and back . Towns are scarce on this stretch . We stop for gas whenever it 's available , because the next station could be anywhere . Frequently , we pass people pulled over dealing with flat tires , something the Denali has yet to experience . The Denali runs great , keeping up a strong pace , and soaks up the rutted road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but overall the Denali handles the punishment as well as a vehicle can . The windshield is ruined by the spraying gravel of a passing RV . But that 's expected . The pitted glass is like the Denali 's initiation to the last great frontier . The further north we go , the more awesome the scenery . Glaciers , waterfalls and crystal blue lakes are as common here as guys selling fake Rolexes are in Manhattan . We chow down at a Dairy Queen in Dawson . In 60 miles we 'll be in Alaska . Into The Wild The guy selling fur bikinis in the shadow of the Alaska Pipeline wo n't come down in price . We drive on . Magically , as we reach the Denali Highway , the home stretch , our cellphone service is restored . We had lost it through northern British Columbia and the Yukon , rendering the Denali 's OnStar system powerless . OnStar is GM 's state-of-the-art , 24-hour communications system that uses a GPS satellite to track your vehicle . It 's amazing . Hit the preprogrammed OnStar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of day or night , and an OnStar customer service rep , who knows exactly where you are via satellite , helps you any way he or she can . Photograph // We used the system several times during the trek from Badwater until we went out of range somewhere around Hyder . OnStar has every gas station , restaurant and hotel ( except for the smallest mom-and-pop stores ) in its database . The OnStar rep is able to tell you how far it is to the next facility and give you directions . In fact , the rep will even talk you in , staying on the line until you reach your destination . The system will do lots of other great things , such as automatically calling the OnStar center if the airbags are deployed in your vehicle . With the cellphone now working , we call OnStar and ask the OnStar operator-in this case Diane , who greets me with a " Yes , Mr. Oldham , how can I help you ? " - to find us a couple of hotel rooms in or near Denali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKinley Village Lodge . She even makes the reservation for us , and programs the hotel 's phone number into our truck 's phone , just in case we need it . OnStar is n't cheap . It 's a $1300 dealer-installed option , plus there 's a monthly fee of $22.50 on top of your usual cell contract . Expensive ? Yes . Invaluable when you 're far from home ? Absolutely . It 's dusk when we reach the park . Sleep seems more important than the view . We 're dead tired . It seems all the road food , specifically the high content of beef jerky and Coca Cola Classic , has made our blood thick and slow . We crash at the McKinley . They say Denali is only visible through the cloud cover one day in three . Luck is on our side . We wake to a clear , cool day with temperatures in the low 50s . We click on the Denali 's seat heaters and drive into the park . The mountain , which stands 20,320 ft. high , is spectacular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buttresses are menacing , but teeming with purity . True beauty . The majestic view of ice-covered Mount Denali , the highest point in North America , instantly wipes away the fatigue of the 4-day IMAX movie and 4200 miles of driving we 've just lived . The view is truly breathtaking and we drink it in . Denali towers over the rest of the Alaska Range . Located in Denali National Park , the mountain was named Mount McKinley after President William McKinley from 1896 until the state of Alaska officially renamed the mountain Denali in 1975 . Denali is a Native American word meaning " the high one . " Today the two names have become interchangeable . And now we know . The GMC Denali is tough . It has proved that . Not many vehicles could have made this trip without a flat tire , without breaking down , without even burning a drop of oil . But we do n't think the truck will make it to the top of its namesake . After all , there is no road to the summit . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We view the spectacle from Wonder Lake , the closest point on a road , still 25 miles away from the base of the mountain . For close to an hour , we just stand there . Looking . And feeling insignificant in the big scheme . <p>
