REPORTERS DO SOME OF THEIR best work between assignments , when a sixth sense leads them to the next big story  --  sometimes simply by nudging them to call the right source and ask , " What 's new ? " Senior correspondent Madeleine Nash made one of those breakthrough calls last summer . But Nash was sniffing out a story that 's 543 million years old . <P> " What 's new about the Cambrian ? " she asked David Jablonski , a paleontologist at the University of Chicago . <P> " You must come down here today , now , this very minute , " Jablonski replied . He told Nash that a colleague had just returned from an expedition to Namibia , where he had unearthed fossils that shed amazing new light on evolution 's " Big Bang "  --  the unparalleled explosion of life forms that sprang into being during the Cambrian period . So began an odyssey that led Nash to labs , museums and rocky outcroppings across the country , and culminated in the extraordinary report in this week 's issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long , long time , " says Nash , who specializes in telling complex science stories in a way that 's not just comprehensible but compelling . The key , she says , is a sense of adventure . " People think of science as a body of knowledge , but in truth it 's a process of discovery . When things do n't make sense , that 's when they get really exciting . " <P> " She gets stirred up by a big story , so her nickname is Mad Nash , " says deputy International editor Charles Alexander . " But I like to call her Mad Dash because she 'll drop everything instantly and go anywhere in the world to report it . " <P> To communicate her sense of excitement , Nash uses bold metaphorical leaps and descriptive passages that can bring to life a half-billion-year-old fossil ( " plump Aysheaia , " she writes , " prancing on caterpillar-like legs " ) . These gifts , says senior editor Philip Elmer-DeWitt , make Nash " a national treasure  --  one of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it deeply , and then write about it with grace and style . " <P> Nash began her Time career 25 years ago as a " clip girl " in the Nation section and quickly moved up to correspondent , covering a variety of beats before devoting herself to science and writing and reporting a dozen or more memorable cover stories  --  so many , in fact , that she 's lost track of the number . Like any great reporter , she works the beat around the clock . Her husband Thomas Nash is a particle physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory .
