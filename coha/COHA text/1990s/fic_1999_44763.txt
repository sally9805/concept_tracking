After a while , a white ship pulls into the waterway . Looming over everything-the palm trees and the swimming pool and the buildings that comprise the Salt &; Palm Condominium-it reminds us of a whale . It intrudes into our peaceful scenario where we are sunbathing and reading our novels , filling us with awe and dread . It is so big , for one thing , and so close . If it were a different kind of vehicle , it would mow us down in our bikinis on our plastic chaises . It would flatten the hibiscus shrub and the sea grass and the little spider who makes her home in the deep nooks of the gardenia . <p> The sun moves behind a cloud , and now we can look up , up , as high as the top deck of the ship , as high as the row of portholes adjoining the top deck of the ship . No one . No one languishing over the railings , no one pining at the windows . This is , we decide , The Phantom Ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the top deck , throwing their heads back , and sipping cocktails out of blue stemmed glasses . They are still in their evening clothes . The one called Marie wears her hair in a chignon ; she is leaning her black-stockinged leg against Charles , who appears lost in thought . " He is dreaming with his eyes open , " says Priscilla , his mother . Other couples drift and float : a tall blond woman dances with a tall blond man . A burly fellow with a mustache storms by shaking his fist at Fred , the bellhop , who shivers in his red coat . <p> " Of what does Charles dream ? " asks Marie , who is sad to be ignored by her handsome fiance . <p> " He dreams always of a ship , " says his mother , who knows him best . <p> " Always the same dream ? " <p> The mother settles her enormous weight onto a deck chair , which creaks as she sits . " Yes . Always the same . I will tell it to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune sets sail on a lavish ocean liner . There he finds himself in the private stateroom of a beautiful woman and her companion , an older man with intensely blue eyes . There is a marble fireplace , a mantel adorned with yellow roses , wallpaper with a pattern of dense , green vines , a velvet chair , a silver tea service on a hammered brass table , an ottoman covered with silk monkeys , a Persian rug featuring stick figures scurrying up a ladder , a leather-bound volume of Heraclitus , and a cat . The cat sits on the woman 's lap purring softly as she strokes it with a gloved hand . Her companion paces in front of the fire , which shoots up its blazing pinnacles behind him , crackling and hissing , as if parodying the man 's restless mood . The window is a dark square framed by a shimmering drapery . Oh wonder of wonders , ' the woman is saying , ' I wonder where I left my handkerchief ? ' <p> " The woman and the man proceed to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dreamer to hear . It is as if he were invisible to them , as they are inaudible to him , as if a thick transparent substance separates the dreamer from the dream . It occurs to him to test this theory by snatching the cat from the woman 's lap . As he predicted , he is unable to do so-his hand encounters something implacable which holds it in check . Thus he sprawls on the rug and contents himself with studying the woman-her lovely brown eyes , the paleness of her skin , her hair which is auburn and curled . She is familiar to him , the way her hands stroke the cat , even the rings on her fingers-he feels as if he 's seen them before when he was much younger , perhaps in a dream . <p> " He is startled by a movement in the dense vines of the wallpaper behind her head . A little man , no more than two inches long , is crawling along , hoisting his tiny body up and over the tangle of spindly vines , balancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves . He is on his way to rescue his wife , who is trapped under the spider who has made her home in the deep nooks of the gardenia . On and on he climbs , the faint cries of his wife peppering the distance between them . Just then there is a terrible noise which brings the dreamer back to himself . The woman stroking the cat has just shot the man pacing in front of the fireplace . She sits with a puzzled look on her face , staring at the tip of the smoking revolver . What should I do now ? ' she asks the dreamer . She looks so helpless , vulnerable . He wracks his mind for some comforting words to say to her , but just then he wakes up . " <p> " Always at the same point ? " asks Marie , fingering the moire of Charles 's cuff . <p> " Always , " says Priscilla his mother , smiling fondly at her son , who at this moment is snapping into an elated consciousness . " Marie ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a jet soars , and the sides of the enormous phantom ship tremble and dip . <p> And the little wife , will she be saved ? Will her valiant husband continue to swing and climb toward her ? From here , her cries pepper the distance like the cries of a cricket or the chattering of ice cubes . Our fingers mark the page in our novel , which begins : " He spoke no more , but after a pause softly groped his way out of the room . . " So , too , the phantom ship gropes softly down the waterway . Where to ? Who knows ? <p>
