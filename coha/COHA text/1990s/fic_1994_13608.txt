A simple , elegant house on a remote Mediterranean island , surrounded by pine woods , the sound of the ocean in the background . The house is owned by an American poet , Robert Blaze . Ancient music plays . Sybil , a large woman dressed in white bee keeping smock , gloves , hat and veil , stands by the door , watching . Her brother , Robert Blaze , almost dances into the room , leading by the hand a beautiful , young , androgynous man , Jamie Knox , dressed in shorts , tank top and flowing kimona . It 's clear that these two men have just made love . BLAZE The bees are cold . KNOX I feel so wonderfully hot . BLAZE Rachel 's coming . BLAZE Rachel ? Rachel who ? BLAZE Your child . BLAZE So I 'm told , though since I neglected to keep her mother under and lock and key , I ca n't be entirely sure . KNOX If you were speaking like that about anyone except your first wife , I would take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishing libertine . KNOX It 's the misfortune of the female poet that the knowledge that she slept with virtually every major voice of the twentieth century so far exceeds her literary reputation . p. 3 BLAZE Dora wrote with Sapphic passion . . . KNOX Quite . BLAZE . . . for that I forgave her everything . KNOX However , you are the oracular voice for the new age . The two reach out and hold hands between the chairs BLAZE You , the light of the last chapter of my life . Why is Rachel coming here ? KNOX To share paradise with us , why not ? BLAZE To see me . BLAZE Rachel is nothing like Dora . Serious to a fault . When she found she could not save her mother she decided to save the world . KNOX Poor Rachel . " The world continues its destructive course/so we must squander love upon the open flesh . " BLAZE Rachel has always been obscenely chaste . She saw how sex destroyed her mother . KNOX Sex was Dora Deming 's elixir ; she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't romanticize Dora . In many ways she was a perfectly ordinary extremely difficult woman . p. 4 KNOX Forgive me , dear , I 'm making you jealous . BLAZE I was jealous every moment Dora was alive . . . KNOX Well , after all , I came here to write about Dora . . . BLAZE It 's a terrible feeling , jealousy . KNOX I did n't know you 'd be waiting to suck out my heart . . BLAZE It 's the only human emotion that also tortures the gods . KNOX Oh , coldness is worse . Coldness is worse than anything hot . BLAZE The bees are cold . I can feel them shivering in their hives . BLAZE I feel I should bolt . KNOX How silly you are . BLAZE Silly ? KNOX Stupendously silly . BLAZE I 've never been called silly in my life . KNOX Bizarrely , divinely , wickedly , ecstatically silly . I 'll say it in print if you like . BLAZE How liberating , yes . To think , I 've been suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my silliness , you have been a closet silly all along . BLAZE Silly , of course . It makes me feel like a new man . Completely free of the past . KNOX " It " ? BLAZE You , you , you . You are the source of all my happiness . BLAZE Dora 's daughter returns to the hive . BLAZE he stands Tell me the truth , Sybil , your blasted bees are giving you an omen . BLAZE Brother , do n't ask for the future from bees . BLAZE We should leave for the mainland . Let Rachel fend for herself . KNOX " The bee is eating at the honey jar eating our food we stole from her the isolated queen who in her cave fed the baby Zeus and gave the god the sting with which he poisons love . " BLAZE Dora scribbled that at lunch one day . BLAZE A bee was eating from her plate . KNOX Robert , play for us . In a most sensuous maner , Jamie hands a recorder to Robert . Robert begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an austere dance . The whistle of a docking ferry boat cuts through their movements. p. 6 BLAZE Rachel , my dear , sweet , Rachel . KNOX Well , I ca n't wait . I 'm going to meet her at the dock . BLAZE Nonsense , you do n't know who she is . KNOX The daughter of Dora Reichenthal Deming and Robert Blaze . She will stand out in a crowd . BLAZE She 'll find her way here quite nicely . BLAZE I 'm going . Where 's my cane ? BLAZE Nonsense . I 'm going myself . BLAZE Brother , wait . I see the whole thing through to the end . You know how that is ? When a window through time is opened up . KNOX What do you see , Sybil ? BLAZE The view opens up , then it closes . It comes over me like the sea breeze . BLAZE Sybil , please . BLAZE They all ask but no one wants to know . They ca n't stand it . BLAZE It 's true , Sybil . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so perfectly happy . BLAZE Do n't speak of our happiness . p. 7 KNOX Do n't be afraid . Rachel is your child as much as Dora 's and while you also are indisputably brilliant , you are eminently sensible and extraordinarily kind . BLAZE Rachel is the fruit of my possession by Dora Deming . One should love one 's daughter purely and simply , showering her with benign paternalism , but I 've always been awed by Rachel . She inherited her mother 's ruthless passion without the healthy amorality of the artist . BLAZE Rachel wants to fix everything . BLAZE She works for a group called Witness for Human Rights . BLAZE She 's a child . BLAZE She 's been documenting war crimes . KNOX Sounds lethal and so I 'm coming with you . BLAZE Good , darling . They leave . Sybil sits on her stool . BLAZE My poor dear child . Why do you ask so much ? All day long my bees have been upset . Stung me twice . Whenever I forget . . . She begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in worn blue denim jumper and baggy sweater appear at the French window , which Rachel opens . Rachel is young , beautiful and haggard ; she 's too thin , and obviously she has never paid any but the slightest attention to her appearance . Her face is already lined with worry . At once , one sees that Rachel is an odd combination of absolute nervous passion and wily strength . Rachel is completely protective of the pregnant woman , who stares with wide frightened eyes under which are large dark circles . Rachel steps into the house , turns to carefully help the other woman . They stand listening to the song. p. 8 REICHENTHAL to the pregnant woman We can rest here . Ca n't we , Aunt Sybil . BLAZE she opens her arms Come here , my child . Welcome home . REICHENTHAL I 'd hardly call it home , except that you 're here . I 've never seen this place before . My father probably forgot I was coming . BLAZE Never mind , I will fold you in my arms . Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven at last REICHENTHAL It 's been years . BLAZE Look at you . You 've grown wrinkles on your face . Your mouth already is falling down . You were too serious growing up . REICHENTHAL You do n't change , Aunt Sybil . BLAZE I 'm embalmed . You will eat my honey now ; it preserves the flesh . Grief needs a home . Sybil and Admira lock eyes . REICHENTHAL I 've seen too much . BLAZE Anyone does who looks out past their nose . . . REICHENTHAL I wrote down every abomination known to man . Do you think anyone cares ? p. 9 BLAZE she puts her hand gently over Rachel 's mouth Who have you brought the old beekeeper ? REICHENTHAL Admira . . . But the pregnant woman has vanished out the window REICHENTHAL Shit , she 's run off . BLAZE She looked at me . REICHENTHAL Admira wo n't talk about what happened to her . BLAZE She 's with child . REICHENTHAL She was a student at the university . Of comparative religions . What a joke . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , yet . BLAZE You should not have brought her to me . I do n't want to . . . REICHENTHAL Her life is ruined , her city destroyed . You are my one hope . Rachel is out the window to look for her REICHENTHAL from outside Admira . Admira , this is the safe place I 've told you about . BLAZE The bees will keep them both away from me . She puts on her bee keeping bonnet and goes out . Jamie and Robert enter p. 10 BLAZE Did you hear something ? KNOX No . With a woman . Is Rachel gay do you think ? BLAZE Rachel has a Mother Teresa complex . KNOX She 's brought her lover home to meet her father . An artist , no doubt . Then we could all be quite jolly . BLAZE You 're an incurable optimist . KNOX You 're rather a fuddy-duddy ; I suppose all visionary poets have a bit of fuddy-duddy at the core . BLAZE Fuddy-duddy , indeed . Let me look at you . silence BLAZE What has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chameleon . And I fell in love with your wisdom . The wealth of feelings written across your face . The humus of the rounded belly . It 's what Michelangelo saw when he progressed from the David to the Prophets . And he could n't finish them . Even he could n't quite dig them out of the rock . Whereas the David is just an idealized form . Pure object with no inner life . BLAZE Only the ancient Greeks truly understood the pull the young man has on the old . The bursting heart inside the firm hot stone . p. 11 KNOX I came here to resurrect the lost voice of Dora Deming . Now I 'm writing a book about you . " Robert Blaze : The Feminized Male and the Future of Life on Earth " . Dora must be insanely jealous from the grave . BLAZE Still , I 'm very much surprised at myself . KNOX I know , you 've never done this before . BLAZE Once , as an undergraduate , like everyone else . KNOX Well , I already have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my superior endowment . BLAZE With pleasure , still I 'm amazed at myself . And , now , my stern , judgmental Rachel is somewhere around . KNOX I think you have to own the fact that you are a bi-sexual . Not just theoretically , rhetorically , but in your belly . I certainly am . In the States we are a growing special interest group . There are bi-sexual support groups . Bi-sexual singles dances . How-to books . Lobbying efforts . BLAZE In the States every profound idea is immediately trivialized . Melted down in the pot . So I fled . KNOX To the birthplace of our lovely civilization . BLAZE Lunacy is everywhere . We 're going to have to exact a great deal of kindness from ourselves . p. 12 KNOX You mean to torture me with your adoring gaze . BLAZE And brutalize you with my tongue . KNOX Now you 're speaking words I understand . The two men move to embrace , and as they do so , they see Admira , the pregnant woman standing in the doorway looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brought death into the house . KNOX Was that Rachel ? BLAZE Did n't you feel it ? The icy chill . KNOX Do n't be ridiculous . BLAZE It 's not enough I have to live here with Sybil and her bees ; the cold hand of Dora Deming is reaching up to spoil my late happiness from the grave . KNOX It was just a pregnant woman from the village whose horizons were suddenly broadened . Let 's find Rachel . Rachel appears at the door , her arms protectively around Admira 's shoulders REICHENTHAL I 'm Rachel . Rachel Reichenthal . BLAZE Hello , Rachel . This is Jamie Knox . p. 13 REICHENTHAL Admira , this is my father , Robert Blaze . This is Admira Ismic , father . I 've brought her here to stay with me . BLAZE Daughter . . . He moves to embrace her . REICHENTHAL Do n't come any closer . BLAZE Rachel . . . ISMIC It is my pleasure to meet you . She speaks clearly , but stiffly . There is tremendous pain hidden in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She holds out her hand . KNOX The pleasure is ours , I 'm sure . BLAZE Welcome . Welcome both of you . REICHENTHAL We had no where else to go . BLAZE This is your home . REICHENTHAL Three hundred miles from this paradise of yours there 's a living hell . BLAZE So I 've heard . Let me look at you Rachel . You look . . . REICHENTHAL Old . BLAZE just like your mother . When I met her she was . . . REICHENTHAL exactly my age . p. 14 BLAZE You must forgive me if I seem a bit shaken . REICHENTHAL Or are you just embarrassed at being surprised with the newest in your long line of teen-age Dora Deming muse replacements . KNOX Well . He realizes she 's mistaken him for a woman . He stays on the other side of the room , leaning languidly against the fireplace . BLAZE Ca n't you give me the benefit of the doubt . I 'm sincerely moved by seeing you , Rachel . I 'd like to give you a hug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quite leery of the male body right now . ISMIC My husband has died . Rachel offered to bring me here to rest for awhile . I hope not to bother you too much . REICHENTHAL We 're going to spend most of our time alone with Aunt Sybil so you need not plan group meals or excursions to Delphi or anything like that . I 'm actually glad you 'll be occupied going over your entire oeuvre with Miss Knox . BLAZE I 'm afraid there 's only one extra room . We did n't expect . . . REICHENTHAL One room is best . BLAZE Jamie has come to interview me for a book about your mother . p. 15 REICHENTHAL Mother 's poetry is finally being rediscovered . Even where I was the women were reading her . BLAZE Now Jamie is writing about my work , too . REICHENTHAL I thought your work had never left the mainstream . When I was a child , Ms Knox , a steady stream of female graduate students found their way to our door in order to deepen their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddess . I think you 'd be far better off writing about my mother ; she was a cynic . BLAZE Rachel , perhaps you and your friend . . . REICHENTHAL Admira Ismic BLAZE Mrs. Ismic ought to rest . . . REICHENTHAL We 've just come from the war . BLAZE Can I get you a drink ? REICHENTHAL I think we should rest . Is there a bottle of water in the room ? BLAZE I 'll get some and I 'll get more towels . Would you like some fruit ? REICHENTHAL Fruit . But , of course , here fruit exists . Admira , would you like some fruit ? Admira is silent ; she stares at the floor . Suddenly p. 16 ISMIC Please , no , no . Do n't go to any trouble for me . Thank you very much . REICHENTHAL Fruit vanished ages ago . Along with running water . Shoes . Milk . Everything but guns and cigarettes . BLAZE I 'll bring you some apricots , grapes and figs . I 'll leave them outside your door . KNOX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rachel as he walks away You see , you were right to come here . This is the Elysian fields , after all . REICHENTHAL When I was young , I thought it was Mt . Olympus wherever my parents were . KNOX from down the hall The two of them , they must have seemed like gods . REICHENTHAL staring at her father Ruthless . . . BLAZE Let me show you the room . REICHENTHAL We 'll find it ourselves . BLAZE It 's the last on the hall , to the left . The women exit Robert sits down heavily . BLAZE Dora Deming will you never loosen your strangle hold on me ? p. 17 KNOX enters with bowl of fruit What fun , she thinks I 'm a woman . BLAZE How strange , when it 's perfectly clear you 're Dionysus . KNOX She just can not imagine her own father with anyone else but a long line of thirsty graduate students . Were you really that tacky ? BLAZE I think she ca n't quite imagine anything at the moment but that poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like marble . BLAZE I 'm completely shaken . KNOX She 's quite pregnant . BLAZE Here we sit , fancying ourselves to be among the most enlightened thinkers the world has ever known while across the water the savages are in ascendancy . . . KNOX Do you really think anyone of us is safe from his own savagery ? BLAZE I left the world in order better to pray for it . Poetry is savage prayer . KNOX And you the savage priest of the moment when we must dare to turn our souls inside out . I 'll take the fruit to them . BLAZE The most extreme suffering , Rachel is drawn to it like a bee to the nectar . Dora did n't have a political bone in her body but she infused her daughter with aan absolute fascination for pain beyond endureance . Dora 's pain which no amount of loving kindness could mitigate . p. 18 KNOX That 's why you 've earned your Dionysiac prize , you weary old mangod . Come , dear . I 'm just going to leave this fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shower the milky way all over you . Jamie leads Robert off ; Sybil enters , tap , tap , tapping her cane . It 's grown dark outside . BLAZE The bees are cold in their hives . The honey will be thin . It goes as it goes . We must make do with what we have . Rachel enters in a white night gown ; she runs to her aunts lap and cries BLAZE Child , child , what are you crying for ? REICHENTHAL I do n't know . I thought I was beyond tears . I thought I would never cry again . BLAZE Well , well . REICHENTHAL It must be coming here . To you . BLAZE Well , that 's all right then . REICHENTHAL Why do I have to come here to confront another one of my father 's blissfully beautiful lovers . Why should I have to put up with that ? BLAZE Why indeed ? REICHENTHAL It 's clear my father idolizes her . He always needs someone to adore . I bet Jamie Knox will drive him mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , why am I crying about Jamie Knox ? p. 19 BLAZE Maybe you would like your father all to yourself for a change . REICHENTHAL I ca n't stand another one of my father 's stupid love affairs . Not now when I have to be strong . I 'm acting like a child . How absurd . BLAZE They call it paradise here . It 's all right for me . I have my bees . REICHENTHAL The great man living in total isolation and complete self-indulgence , endlessly pontificating about the human soul . BLAZE What will she do with that child . . . . REICHENTHAL I 'm so exhausted , I ca n't think anymore . That 's what happened . The tiniest shred of kindness . Figs and grapes left outside a door on a blue enamel plate . Oh , god , I died and woke in paradise . I would think so myself except for the latest soap opera being played in front of my nose . BLAZE What can she do with it ? REICHENTHAL Listen to me , Aunt Sybil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live through the worst thing anyone can imagine and become whole again . BLAZE You 're frightening your old aunt . REICHENTHAL It must be possible . Because if it 's not possible then surely human beings are doomed . p. 20 BLAZE People who have lived as I have lived are not necessarily wise . REICHENTHAL You taught me everything . You and your bees . You will help me with Admira , Aunt Sybil . You must help me . BLAZE And the child ? The child she 's carrying ? REICHENTHAL She 'll give birth to it . We will help her do it . BLAZE She wants to kill it . REICHENTHAL She wants to kill herself . But you and I will keep her from doing that . At least we must try . BLAZE You 're just like your father . REICHENTHAL If I could save one , just one life ; you do n't know how many nights I lay awake praying for that chance . BLAZE But , at least , your father knows enough to stay at home and write the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happen however he wants it to happen because they 're all his people and he 's their one true god . Go to sleep , now , Rachel . It 's gotten dark . Jamie comes down the hall , he is completely , beautifully naked . Rachel bumps into him . All during their encounter , the moonlight plays across his naked body so that he glows with an ethereal beauty . Rachel is in shadow . Sybil , seated , is in deeper shadow. p. 21 REICHENTHAL Get out of my way . KNOX It 's so hot . I got up to look at the stars . Would you like to come out ? REICHENTHAL How can you walk around this house like that ? KNOX It 's so hot . And I did n't think it was fair to leave you in the dark as to my true gender . REICHENTHAL Actually , Mr. Knox , I was simply hoping you were a nice young androgynous woman , preferably gay , come here to write about my mother . Then there was a chance we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . A detail or two is not quite accurate but then that sort of thing is hardly important . I think we 'll all get along famously . REICHENTHAL I do n't want to be around men . KNOX I have nothing in common with my brothers in the grip of testosterone poisoning who are butchering one another for land and nation . REICHENTHAL I find you impudent and disgusting . KNOX Really ? REICHENTHAL You 're walking around my father 's house naked . KNOX How was I supposed to know you were up . In any case , I 'm afraid I ca n't muster up the least bit of shame when it comes to my body which by all accounts is astonishingly irresistible . p. 22 REICHENTHAL I think your body is perfectly repulsive , Mr. Knox . KNOX Thank you , Ms Reichenthal-Deming-Blaze . Is this the nineteenth century ? REICHENTHAL I 'm afraid not . Actually , it 's the desperately late end of the twentieth century . And I have a woman down the hall who was held in captivity for three months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and night by a bevy of smug , self-satisfied men just about your age . KNOX I 'll bet they were terrified of themselves . Every thought and feeling pent up inside her for so long comes rushing out at this young man who is so annoying , yet so strangely empathic , even appealing . REICHENTHAL Oh , yes , I 'm certain the thought of a trembling naked woman tied to a bed struck abject terror in their hearts and made them all want to cry out for their mothers . But , nevertheless , to prove that they were made of heroic stuff , they took turns raping her over and over . And the act itself had an odd effect on them for it seemed to endow them with a superhuman strength . By all accounts they became even fiercer soldiers . The harder they fought , the more insatiable they became , the more they tormented the captive women . Only in hell could such a scene be possible . Something had turned these mother 's sons into devils , you see , just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of whether or not they can ever be made to recognize the cruelty of their actions and so slowly learn how to live decent lives again in civilized society . Or will they always be sexual monsters returned to civilian life raping and brutalizing their girl-friends , wives and daughters until the next war gives social sanction to their actions ? Someone like you should take this up , Mr. Knox , since you identify with the particular anatomical device which allowed these men to destroy a woman at the same time as making her pregnant . However , I am far more interested in the lives of the innocent women . How is it possible for someone whose innermost self has been violated , whose will has been broken , whose flesh has been torn and ruptured , whose body has been filled with a child she did not want , the " father " of whom is a mass of cruel undifferentiated brutality , how is it possible for this woman to continue to live ? Is it possible ? And why should she ? So she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eternal victim , a tantalizing item in the newspapers of the world ? But most of these women can not speak about what was done . They have lost the power of speech . Then one must wonder if the birth might kill her ? Then , again , how will she be able to restrain herself from murdering the child she bears ? If the child survives , what will become of it ? Why does n't the women simply eat glass . Some of them actually did . Hoping to kill themselves , they bit the rims off of their cups , chewed and swallowed them while they were chained to their beds . So , their humane captors began to serve them weak broth in metal cups . The men wanted the women to continue to live in order to make them pregnant . In this way , as I 'm sure you have heard , they felt they could totally destroy the men they were fighting across the city there . Is there anyway out of this circle of suffering ? Or have the monstrous actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but how then does one command an erection ? created only two choices for the survivors : madness or the turning of themselves into monsters . One can imagine a future race of heroes raised on their mothers ' knees to become the avengers of their mothers ' rapes . If the mother lives . I will not have you walking naked in this house , Mr. Knox , have I made myself perfectly clear . Put on your clothes . She tosses her army shirt at his groin and exits . He catches the shirt and wraps it around himself. p. 23 KNOX Is n't she splendid ! She 's everything I would have hoped for from Dora Deming 's daughter . BLAZE Her mother killed herself . KNOX I know . BLAZE Rachel is all I have left . KNOX She 's wonderful . Brilliant , arrogant , committed , more beautiful than she dares to imagine . What a family . You know , Sybil , I never had a family . I do n't even know my father . BLAZE The dead one . You could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I prefer the company of Robert and Rachel , thank you very much . BLAZE The dead one with the swollen belly , keep her away from me . KNOX I would be happy to help if Rachel will let me which she wo n't . I 'm not afraid of suffering , you see . It does seem rather odd , but I have been blessed with the gift of happiness . BLAZE I 'm always right but no one ever listens to a thing I say . KNOX I 'm not the least bit afraid of the dead woman . BLAZE I 'm glad for that . p. 24 KNOX I 'm going outside to dance underneath the moon . He whips off the shirt Maybe Robert will wake up and take photographs . Jamie exits . Sybil remains seated in shadows . Admira walks down the hall , she is still fully dressed . She stands at the window , looking out . Her pregnant belly silhouetted in the moon light . Robert comes down the hall , bare chested , a camera around his neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focuses and clicks . She jumps , stand there speechless , shivering . BLAZE Oh , I 'm very sorry . Please forgive me . I promise you , I wo n't come near you . She backs away BLAZE It was a very beautiful picture . I 'll give it to you . You at the window in the moon light . Can you understand what I say ? Admira covers her mouth with her hands BLAZE I saw a luminous light a your eyes . As if you were looking quite far away , into some other time and place . That 's why I snapped the shutter . Without thinking . I am sorry . I wo n't do such a thing again . You truly are safe here . No one will hurt you . Maybe it was just the moon , but I do n't think so . I think your eyes were sparkling for a moment . Odd , is n't it , that in Western art we have no representations at all of pregnant women until we come to the fifteenth century Pregnant Madonna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of immaculate conception . And she seems completely perplexed by her situation . Of course , we assume , that in her case , the whole process was fairly gentle . But we have to think that , do n't we ? My point is that even the Mother of Christ did n't choose her own fate . How few women actually do . Perhaps that 's the real difference between women and men ; men think they are free , women do n't even bother to pretend . Surely , Mary did n't ask to become the mother of a god . I say " a god " not " god " you notice . I am what one might call a pagan . I really am a believer in multiple gods . How can one not be , after all ? Look at the violence unleashed by the endless fights over which god is the best . We have to learn to accept . The divine spirit is reborn all the time to mortal women . We never know . Actually , in classical mythology , most gods were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that sense , I suppose , immaculate conception was a forward step . If , indeed , the phrase is not simply a cover-up . Perhaps there 's no way a truly divine presence could enter our present world except as the result of incredible force . Does this sound too much like justification ? I do n't intend that . It 's just that for every extreme action , there 's bound to be an equally extreme reaction . And for us all , the same question remains in the end : how much do we let external events create us and how much do we hold ourselves responsible for what we become ? In your case , the question poses itself at the extreme edge of tolerance . Still , I would hesitate to say you do n't bear some responsibility , not for what has happened to you of which you were obviously completely innocent , but for what , despite everything , you might still imagine yourself to be . Rachel enters p. 25 REICHENTHAL I 'm here , Admira ; he does n't mean any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babbling , I 'm afraid . REICHENTHAL How do you dare ? BLAZE I do n't know . Something about her set me talking . REICHENTHAL She 's fallen asleep on her feet . At last . BLAZE Let 's carry her over to the couch . REICHENTHAL She might wake up screaming . BLAZE Maybe not . They move her to the couch . No sound . BLAZE We ought to undress her . REICHENTHAL No , she ca n't bear it . BLAZE She smells a bit rancid . REICHENTHAL She 's filthy , but what can I do ? She ca n't bear to be touched and she wo n't touch herself . The most important thing now is that she not be forced to do anything , so she begins to feel free to choose the simplest action . That 's why you and that other person have to stay completely away from her . She really should n't be around men . I would n't have come here if I had had the slightest notion about the sex of your current lover . p. 26 BLAZE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REICHENTHAL It 's the last thing we needed . BLAZE Do n't be such a prude , Rachel . REICHENTHAL I 'm trying to protect Admira ; I 'm sorry if that seems like prudishness to you . What were you saying to her ? BLAZE Oh , nonsense I suppose . Somehow , she makes everything seem like nonsense . REICHENTHAL I know . BLAZE Rachel , we are difficult people , you and I ; above all , we must try to be kind to each other . REICHENTHAL I wish you would send him away . BLAZE But I need him . REICHENTHAL Why ca n't you ever be enough for yourself . Why are you always needing the most unlikely people ? BLAZE Why did n't you just come away from all that suffering for awhile ? Why did you bring it with you ? REICHENTHAL Because I 'm trying to do some minuscule good . BLAZE I 'm trying to write some poetry . REICHENTHAL We 're stuck again just where we 've always been . p. 27 BLAZE And since both our hearts may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another . REICHENTHAL Look , I 'm a professional . My heart has nothing to do with it . BLAZE Perhaps . Let 's go to bed . REICHENTHAL I 'll sleep here on the floor . I do n't want that idiot naked boy dancing through . BLAZE He 's climbed into the window in my room by this time . I 'll see he does n't bother you again . REICHENTHAL Good . BLAZE It 's not very comfortable . REICHENTHAL It 's all right . I 'm used to it . BLAZE I 'll bring the mattress . REICHENTHAL Please , do n't bother . BLAZE Right , well , good night . REICHENTHAL Good night . Thanks for getting Admira to sleep . BLAZE Just luck . REICHENTHAL With healing it always is . BLAZE With poetry , too . REICHENTHAL Well , why not trust to luck for awhile and send that person away ? p. 28 BLAZE Let 's not get started again . REICHENTHAL Right . Jamie 's voice is heard KNOX Robert ? I will come down the hall to get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves . REICHENTHAL Whatever possessed me to come here ? To this rarefied hot house . Sybil gets up and goes to her. @x The day is hot and bright . A row of bright blue bee hives in the background . In the foreground a large tin bathtub . Admira is in the bath . Sybil is singing and washing her back delicately with a natural sponge . Rachel sits nearby , a novel , The English Patient , open on her lap , she watches them , a soft smile on her face . BLAZE There you are , clean as the day you were born . ISMIC Do n't stop . Sybil picks up a tin watering can , gently showers Admira BLAZE Summer rain . ISMIC Do n't stop your song , Sybil , do n't stop singing . Sybil begins to sing again ISMIC Your voice keeps me anchored here . Sybil continues to sing ISMIC Otherwise , I would run . I would turn into the white cow , who was it ? Chased by the big fly . REICHENTHAL Io . ISMIC I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's nonsense , is n't it , when you are rooted right to this spot by a silken cord that runs through your mother 's mother to you and on again to the end of time . p. 30 ISMIC How was she like that ? Io . REICHENTHAL Zeus raped her . ISMIC I see . REICHENTHAL I hate mythology . ISMIC Robert told me about Io . REICHENTHAL He would . ISMIC How the girl suddenly felt four feet under her and a thick hide . We were speaking of change . How suddenly one becomes so different from who one was . Sybil holds out a pure white thick towel BLAZE Come , now , you wo n't turn into a white cow sitting there . You 'll turn into a prune . Admira steps out of the bath wrapped in the towel . Sybil gently rubs her dry . Then helps her into a pure white shift . Her hair still in a towel over her head . Sybil begins to fix her hair . ISMIC So much is gone . REICHENTHAL So much of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what became of anything . REICHENTHAL You will remember ; we will help you . You will put yourself back together . I promise . p. 31 ISMIC It dropped out of the sky . BLAZE Listen to the bees . Eternity is in their hum . REICHENTHAL You 're stronger everyday . ISMIC Whose hands are these ? BLAZE How pretty you look . ISMIC Where is the child ? BLAZE Robert 's got him . Robert enters carrying the baby in a belly-pack . ISMIC Robert dotes on him . That is how to say it ? BLAZE Not quite . Robert dotes on both of you . ISMIC Robert dotes on everyone . It 's a fault . BLAZE Doting too much ? ISMIC Too much doting may not be good for Robert . BLAZE An anti-doter in our midst , daughter . REICHENTHAL Double doting is the sole antidote for anti-doters . BLAZE The soul needs no antidote for anti-doters when doting is the soul 's pure delight . REICHENTHAL Groan . p. 32 BLAZE Or words to that effect . Jamie enters carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnic cloth and pour the wine . KNOX Wine and fruit in the late afternoon . REICHENTHAL Great . BLAZE Let 's celebrate . KNOX The sheer , complete and total , wonderful boredom of daily life . Never thought I 'd say that . BLAZE Never . KNOX How thrilling this quiet is . Rachel 's actually reading a novel . The baby only woke up once during the night . Sybil made biscuits for breakfast . ISMIC Sybil sings all the time to me . BLAZE The bees have been singing all day long . They sing about where the nectar is . KNOX I have nearly finished my chapter . BLAZE It does seem miraculous . ISMIC To me , very much . BLAZE You 've made an astonishing recovery . BLAZE Well , well . . . KNOX Quiet , please . A toast to us all . p. 33 BLAZE To many more long , slow , happy days like this . KNOX To our friendship . BLAZE To the rejuvenating powers of love . Pause BLAZE I find you all so very beautiful . KNOX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for taking us in . BLAZE Of course . REICHENTHAL And for all you 've done . ISMIC I am not too much of a guest . BLAZE Nonsense . I 'm truly happy . Happier , now , than I 've been in a long while . BLAZE The bees come home in the late afternoon . KNOX It 's a silly word " hap-py " . BLAZE A small word for what I feel , joy is far . . . Jamie puts his hand over Robber 's mouth KNOX Do n't say any more . REICHENTHAL I love the sound of the bees coming back , drunk and dripping with pollen . They begin to set up the food p. 34 BLAZE Perhaps we should move ? REICHENTHAL We 're safe here . BLAZE My Rachel likes to live on the edge of danger all the time . REICHENTHAL Even in paradise . KNOX Where else could paradise be , but set on the lip of danger ? BLAZE Bees only sting when fear is in the air . BLAZE Really , Sybil ? BLAZE Once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer house on the Cape , I kept my pet bee hive on the ground to the side of the drive . One day , Rachel and three of her friends decided to hold a tea party for their dolls right there and they used my bee hive for their tea table . I could not believe my eyes . Those four sweet little girls with their pretty little dolls were sitting sipping water from small china cups while hundreds of bees who could n't go home were beating the air above their heads . But , do you know , not a child got stung . Because those sweet little girls had no fear of anything . KNOX Little Rachel at a doll tea party ! How quaint . BLAZE Surrounded by angry bees , do n't forget . p. 35 REICHENTHAL I remember it so clearly . Sybil carried us to safety two under each arm , kicking and screaming because she had spoiled our fun . BLAZE Rachel was changed from that moment on . Altered under my arms . REICHENTHAL You could tell , could n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You started climbing trees ; I could never find you at all . BLAZE Is n't it wonderful how an event just slightly out of the ordinary can have such a profound impact on the soul . REICHENTHAL As if the pieces of the puzzle of who one is suddenly fall into place . BLAZE And such epiphanies lie in wait for us everywhere . They are the essential fabric of daily life ; the stuff of the most artless interaction between human beings and nature . They lift our everyday existence to a level of sublime intensity . As long as one lives simply , openly , available to catch each epiphany in the flesh . ISMIC One must live without war . KNOX raises his glass To daily epiphanies in the flesh ! REICHENTHAL toasts To life without war , for everyone , everywhere . p. 36 KNOX Paradise on earth . BLAZE murmuring to the child Child of paradise , that 's who you are . ISMIC It 's good , you two together . BLAZE Suddenly , I 'm writing about mothers and sons . KNOX Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my mother in a very long time . BLAZE I think of her everyday . BLAZE She was quite a commanding creature . BLAZE She sent us to see Judith Anderson in Medea . BLAZE No . I do n't remember that . BLAZE You could n't have been six years old . I could n't go home afterwards . REICHENTHAL Father , what a thing to forget . BLAZE I dragged you all over town , tears streaking my face . BLAZE Well , here I am hopelessly ensnared by the ancient world . BLAZE It was so beautiful and so terrible . KNOX Mothers and sons all right . p. 37 ISMIC Sons should honor their mothers . Honor and protect them . REICHENTHAL Of course , they should . ISMIC That 's how the world made sense to me . But I make no sense of anything any more . Not the kindness of all of you . KNOX Kindness is completely inexplicable . BLAZE Do you know that Medea 's murder of her children is actually Euripides ' invention ? In all the earlier versions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her . KNOX Well , that 's not terribly dramatic , is it ? REICHENTHAL Admira escaped with her son safe in her belly . BLAZE Most women do . ISMIC I do n't feel like Admira anymore . REICHENTHAL I promise you , we will find Admira again , wo n't we Aunt Sybil . Sybil begins to sing again . Admira lays her head on Rachel 's lap ; Rachel strokes her hair and she , herself , leans back to rest against Sybil who continues to hum . KNOX Look at them . The three goddesses , lolling about . REICHENTHAL We 're not goddesses , we 're mortal women . So do n't be afraid of us. p. 38 KNOX I worship you from afar . Jamie pulls Robert to him , Robert lies on Jamie 's lap , with the baby on his chest . Jamie strokes Robert 's head . Sybil begins to hum softly ; her sound increases as Robert begins his speech so that it is like a jam session of words and music between brother and sister . KNOX But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One ca n't help what one writes , my dear . One really has no choice in the matter . KNOX One ca n't help who one loves . BLAZE I 'm writing a new version of the Metamorphoses , in which sons are transformed into mothers . Mothers into lovers . Lovers into the beloved priests of the eternal she-god . And the ruiners , the despoilers of earth , the money-grubbers turn into worshippers of her many moons . Warriors transform into servants of life , bearers of seed , sacred flame , and fierce with desire . I 've wanted to do it for a very long time . I want to sing out to everyone " Change form . Change form . Do n't be afraid . It takes but an instant to see the world in a new way . Turn , turn . " Robert 's words and Sybil 's song crescendo BLAZE Live like bees ! BLAZE These days I want to write and write . I know it 's futile . But what else can I do ? p. 39 BLAZE Bees know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish everything ; they nurse the young , make food . BLAZE I found a wonderful illustration today , I must show you , Sybil . " Bee Goddess Rising " from a Minoan seal ring , 1500 B. C. KNOX Just a minute please . Before signing on to Sybil 's cult of the bee may we all pause a for moment to consider the fate of the poor drone who literally explodes in the air at the exact moment he provides the queen with all the fertilized eggs she will ever need . Dying instantly in the midst of his ecstasy . BLAZE It happens to one drone in a thousand . BLAZE Striking fear eternal into men 's hearts . BLAZE Most drones live quiet lives ; the worker bees feed them , care for them . Clean the hive . KNOX It would happen to me . In another life , I was the drone bee . BLAZE Consort to the Bee Goddess . KNOX Spilling my guts for love . BLAZE Her son who is both her lover and victim . KNOX Helpless to resist her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . From your ashes rises up a serpent whose egg she eats so that the son is reborn to her once more . KNOX To be sacrificed again on her alter . REICHENTHAL This conversation is insane . ISMIC Do n't protect me , Rachel . You want I should tell you all kinds of things , but you do n't want me to hear . BLAZE Let them be . REICHENTHAL The devouring goddess . Rubbish . This is what men always think . It 's just an excuse for your wars . KNOX Whose wars ? REICHENTHAL Yours . Until you do something to stop them . Put your body on the line . KNOX Sure , I 'll go stand between the murderous hordes . I 'll chant mantras at them . " Brothers " I 'll say . REICHENTHAL Yes , if enough of us did that . If we stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the victims . KNOX Rachel is an amazing woman , Robert . She puts an intellectual to shame . REICHENTHAL We could do something if we wanted to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but this idle chatter all the time . p. 41 KNOX I think she may even be a dreamer , like her father . REICHENTHAL There are sick people in this world , who kill with impunity because we let them . BLAZE Murderers become like gods in men 's eyes ; they seem immortal because they are so totally devoid of pity . KNOX I get it ; Medea kills her sons to prove she is a goddess . She is free even of self-pity . She sacrifices her own sons to prove her divinity . BLAZE She cuts herself free of the earth . REICHENTHAL My father 's goddess talk always sounds totally infantile to me . ISMIC Robert talks like a child always . REICHENTHAL I always thought both my parents were children . BLAZE Poor Rachel should n't have had poets for parents . REICHENTHAL It 's been difficult . BLAZE I suppose so . REICHENTHAL It 's all right ; I stopped listening long ago . BLAZE That makes it better , I 'm sure . REICHENTHAL The air here is so crystal clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we know . They make adults wrinkle their nose . BLAZE It is that time again . RACHEL &amp; JAMIE Not near the food . ISMIC I should do it . BLAZE Nonsense , you just had your bath . ISMIC If I could . BLAZE Let me . BLAZE It 's all right , Sybil ; I 'll just take him off for a minute . BLAZE I delivered him . BLAZE For your brilliant heroics on that night you are exempt from ever having to change a diaper . I , however , was simply pacing like a lunatic around the perimeters of the house . So , now , I must suffer . REICHENTHAL strokes her head Admira did all the work . ISMIC I do n't know . BLAZE I just held my hands out . He came out wrinkled and pink . I gave him to Rachel . REICHENTHAL And I laid him on your chest . You remember his eyes . ISMIC I remember his eyes because I could see already they were green . p. 43 REICHENTHAL Like your eyes . ISMIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I knew there was a happy ending . ISMIC Sybil began to sing . Sybil sang and sang . BLAZE I sang when you looked in his eyes . REICHENTHAL And you named him Robert . ISMIC Because Robert is the first kind man . BLAZE Now the Roberts have serious work to do . He goes out cooing to the baby KNOX A man who changes a diaper is an heroic man . REICHENTHAL History could be rewritten around that concept . KNOX I have n't the stomach for it myself . BLAZE His poop smells so sweet . KNOX No , history . REICHENTHAL Sybil 's right , until they begin to eat actual food , babies have the sweetest smelling poo . KNOX I ca n't say I ever noticed . BLAZE Mother 's milk is sweet . p. 44 REICHENTHAL It tastes like vanilla ice cream . That 's why the whole village lines up every night outside the gelateria . KNOX Did Dora nurse you , Rachel ? I inquire as her biographer , of course . ISMIC We drank a glass of my milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that ? REICHENTHAL It was a female rite . KNOX A goddess orgy without my consent ? ISMIC Sybil also drank . KNOX This is the sort of thing that drives men to distraction . Breast envy . It 's terrifying . Robert and the baby return BLAZE What ? REICHENTHAL Please , Jamie . KNOX Male envy of the female breast . BLAZE I do n't believe in it . Adoration , yes . KNOX Come , now , do n't you wish you could nurse that child ? BLAZE I am nursing him . KNOX With your own titty , dim-witty . Would n't you love to feel him pulling at your nipple . In and out . In and out . p. 45 ISMIC My milk dried up . Jamie jumps up KNOX I am in complete envy of the female breast . BLAZE to Admira It often happens like that . ISMIC After we drank it , my milk went away . REICHENTHAL It 's all right , Admira . You nursed him for awhile . ISMIC I ca n't tell . KNOX You were beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stand it . Breast envy is nothing . Womb envy is the real dilemma . ISMIC He saw me ? REICHENTHAL Jamie is making fun of us . He does n't really feel that way . BLAZE I hope not . I 'm feeling rather inadequate . KNOX Womb envy is the true source of all our misery . I 'm sure of it . The priests of the goddess castrated themselves to become more like women . You wrote that in one of your books . BLAZE Self-castration was a form of worship . REICHENTHAL In light of current events , I think we should bring the custom back . p. 46 KNOX I thought you were n't interested in goddess talk ? ISMIC He put the evil eye on me . BLAZE It can happen like that . BLAZE Sybil , for god 's sake . BLAZE Men are not supposed to look . REICHENTHAL Your milk dried up because you were undernourished , Admira . ISMIC Rachel , you are so rational . REICHENTHAL Somebody has to be rational around here . ISMIC Rational is not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It frightens them . KNOX I disagree . Men need to see . REICHENTHAL to Admira It 's important to try to understand what you 've been through . ISMIC I do n't want to think anymore . Everything is running back and forth inside my brain . Admira has become quite distraught . BLAZE It 's important to be in the present . Right now . In the safety of this moment . Surrounded by love . p. 47 ISMIC My city was like a light in the dark night . My city was like Troy . We all intermarried in my city . We all carried one another 's blood . BLAZE I went to your city with Dora several times . It was very beautiful . KNOX Just today , I came across the section in your diary . It impressed me so . He opens the diary and reads " Each night at dusk we sit and drink on the terrace of the Hotel Europa and watch the white doves fly in the air . " ISMIC We would meet there to talk about all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read this to them , Robert ? ISMIC Now it is spoiled , that hotel . Gone . Yes , read it to me , please . KNOX reads " Situated around the square in front of the hotel in this most cosmopolitan of cities , are a mosque , a synagogue , an orthodox and a catholic church ; there are sounds of the men and of the bells calling us all to prayer . Last night , as we sat sipping wine , the entire city seemed to be praying as cities do in the dusk when the golden light is thrown down on their stones by the sky gods , those golden ghosts of our ancestors who have given us the open city , the city whose life is like a gaping wound , who suffers with us and releases that which is best inside us . Impulsively , I reached out to take Dora 's hand . She moved it quickly out from under mine , resisting even this touch as she has resisted them all for many months . But just then the mosque came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullness of the voices the doves took flight so that the soul of the city seemed to be visibly rising upward in the invisible hand of god . Dora reached for my hand and brought it to her lips , kissing it in an almost obsequious manner that sent a shiver up and down my spine . She smiled . " Robert , " she said , " you have loved me better than I have had any right to be loved , but you have not made me whole . Often I hate you so much for all that you 've given me that I can not bear to have you touch me . All I can feel is revulsion for the ineffectual goodness of your love . " I feel I have lost her . I fear she will not live . But then we made love in the Hotel Europa . For one night the curse seemed to lift . " Silence . Rachel and Jamie look hard at one another . Robert is visibly upset. p. 48 BLAZE It 's strange to hear such things aloud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad I heard it . KNOX I wonder if the men of my generation will dare to risk such selfless love ? ISMIC These days I think my self can begin to feel . But not if my city falls . REICHENTHAL The city wo n't fall , Admira . ISMIC Can you see it , Sybil ? BLAZE I see the bees swarm like one big animal . They live only for the good of the hive . BLAZE But cities release in us our individuality . Because we can be truly anonymous in a city , we can also create a selfhood that is uniquely ours . ISMIC When I walked alone in my city , then I felt I knew who I was . BLAZE That 's what I was trying to say . KNOX And I was trying to say that as women rediscover their ancient powers , men have become terrified again . That is why men fight with such fury as now . REICHENTHAL The city will survive , Admira . ISMIC Yes , yes , my friend . p. 49 REICHENTHAL We should bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KNOX Who should bomb them ? REICHENTHAL The West . Europe . Us . KNOX Some poor kid in an airplane . REICHENTHAL to Robert You 're a poet . People read what you write . You should issue a statement . BLAZE No doubt , but should it say ? REICHENTHAL Bomb them . Lift the arms embargo . BLAZE There has to be a better way . REICHENTHAL Do you know what they do up in the hills ? They shoot to kill the women and the children . ISMIC I do n't want to live in the world . KNOX That 's why we live here . REICHENTHAL But they aim at the men below the waist . ISMIC My friends have no legs . REICHENTHAL To maim them . BLAZE That 's enough , Rachel , enough . KNOX Let 's talk about something else . Silence p. 50 REICHENTHAL Pass the grapes . Jamie hands her a bunch . She eats and feeds a grape to Admira . Suddenly everyone begins to eat grapes with an increasing , almost rhythmic , intensity , passing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no sound except the sounds of the grapes being sucked on and swallowed . KNOX Dionysus comes from the East , to possess , to release . . . BLAZE " These blessings he gave : /laughter to the flute/and the loosing of cares/when the shining wine is spilled/ at the feast of the gods . " KNOX Women need to invite men into their mysteries . BLAZE Then they would n't be mysteries . BLAZE Woman is the mystery . KNOX She needs to invite the man in . REICHENTHAL Nonsense . Jamie jumps to his feet , a bunch of grapes held over his crotch KNOX Just try to imagine , for a moment , how terrifying it is for the new god to stand completely open and vulnerable before the herd of strong and vital women , to stand full like a ripe fruit . An incredible , edible , disposable display . p. 51 REICHENTHAL You are ridiculous . KNOX A sacrificial beast to be torn apart . Eaten raw . REICHENTHAL I 'm not interested in men 's problems . KNOX But you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recite each gruesome detail . It turns you on . REICHENTHAL How dare you . KNOX But you refuse to let yourself enter into the real complexities of human relationships . You 've barricaded yourself behind your own considerable brain because your mother was Dora Deming and you 're afraid of feeling . REICHENTHAL To you everything is just a game without consequence . That 's why you 're a literary critic . KNOX It 's impossible to discuss anything with you . REICHENTHAL You 're the impossible one . BLAZE Children , please . REICHENTHAL Pass the grapes . Jamie moves toward her , holding the bunch of grapes waist high , like a full ripe sex . BLAZE " Handle with holy care/ the violent wand of god ! " p. 52 KNOX Eat . They are all for you . He bends Rachel 's head into the grapes ; she eats . REICHENTHAL They 're so sweet . Jamie laughs , kneeling in front of her , he takes her hands KNOX But of course , they are sweet . That 's what I 've been telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to taste a little sweetness , Rachel ? On your tongue ? The intimacy between Rachel and Jamie startles Admira into a sudden flashback . She screams . ISMIC No . No . I do n't want to see . BLAZE Look at me , child , look at me . BLAZE I 'm taking the baby to the house . ISMIC Do n't touch me . Do n't . Please , do n't . BLAZE Sybil is with you . It 's all right . ISMIC I am broken . Broken . Inside . REICHENTHAL jumps up Damn it . I 've been stung . I 've been stung by a bee . ISMIC In her own blood , they push her down . BLAZE Sybil is holding you now . Admira buries herself in Sybil 's body p. 53 ISMIC So cold . Cold . Wet . The stink . BLAZE Sybil 's going to wrap you in a feather quilt . Feed you some nice warm soup . ISMIC They have a knife , a knife to her throat . Sybil breaks from Admira , chases the imaginary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of here ! Get ! ISMIC Leave them alone . Let them go . Do n't make her do that . BLAZE Leave my child alone ! ISMIC Over and over again . Admira weeps in Sybil 's arms BLAZE There . They 're gone , now . Sybil chased them away . They wo n't come back . ISMIC I ca n't . I ca n't . BLAZE You do n't have to , anymore . You do n't have to do anything you do n't want to do . Sybil will rock you to sleep . Sybil takes Admira off , singing to her . KNOX Your mouth is puffing up . Rachel stands , her hand over her lip KNOX I 'll get some ice . He dips his hand into the cooler , applies ice to her mouth. p. 54 REICHENTHAL Leave me alone . It 's just a bee sting . KNOX Quiet . You can barely talk . Your lip is a mess . They are staring at one another . Silence . KNOX You 've been stung . Rachel , the invulnerable . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . REICHENTHAL Get out of my way . KNOX Why do you torture yourself , it 's perfectly natural . We 're young . We 're beautiful . REICHENTHAL Look what you 've done to Admira . KNOX What I 've done ? But she needs to remember . You keep saying she does . REICHENTHAL Not that way . KNOX There is no gentle way . It 's bound to be a shock to the system . REICHENTHAL You did it on purpose , all of it . KNOX You ate . REICHENTHAL Oh , god . KNOX You were insatiable . REICHENTHAL You planned the whole thing . KNOX Not the bee sting . No , the bee sting is divine intervention . p. 55 REICHENTHAL I 'm frightened . KNOX But I 'm frightened of you , too . REICHENTHAL Then please leave me alone . KNOX You 've been so good to everyone . Someone has to be good to Rachel for a change . Otherwise , you 'll grow hard . It will be too late . You 'll be doomed to moral perfection . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REICHENTHAL I 'm humiliated . I feel like a fool . KNOX I did n't expect you to gobble up those grapes like that . REICHENTHAL Go away . KNOX Let me put some more ice on that lip . REICHENTHAL I 'll do it myself , thank you . KNOX You ca n't live as a witness . Life has to touch you . The bee stings , you know . REICHENTHAL To say the most obvious thing , my father fancies himself in love with you . KNOX I am the new man Robert has spent his entire life envisioning . REICHENTHAL I detested you the moment I saw you . KNOX The man free to change shape . You 've broken out in a sweat . p. 56 REICHENTHAL It 's the bee sting . KNOX Rachel , my Rachel . Everything happens as it was meant to happen , no matter what you do . REICHENTHAL If I believed that I could not live . KNOX If you believed that it would make it easier to do the work you do . REICHENTHAL You purposely tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fated from our first night . REICHENTHAL I am not possessed by you . KNOX Do you think your refusal makes a difference to me ? REICHENTHAL I 'm afraid nothing makes a difference to you . KNOX You want me to adore you from afar . You want me to burn silently . I will . But listen to me , Rachel , you 'll make me more unfaithful to Robert doing that than if I could admit my desire openly and live it out . Love is not lethal , Rachel . I 'll protect you and Robert , both . Safe sex for the heart . REICHENTHAL My head is throbbing . My lip hurts . KNOX Well , then , come , I 'll walk you back to the house . No one will be the wiser . p. 57 REICHENTHAL I will be leaving soon , in any case . KNOX Do n't you find it rather odd that the only place you feel safe is in the middle of a war ? REICHENTHAL I prefer to try to do some slight good . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not evil unless it 's censored inside the self . Then the horrors break loose . REICHENTHAL You might be right . But it 's not in my nature . I just ca n't . KNOX All right . In a way , I 'm glad to be spared the drama of it all . REICHENTHAL I think I shall be exceedingly glad never to have to see you again . KNOX I feel positively light headed . REICHENTHAL Lucky you . My head feels like it 's being operated on with a sledge hammer . KNOX See how you suffer . Just observe . I 'm not asking anything more . REICHENTHAL I 'm going back to the house . Admira needs my help . KNOX All right . I think I 'll take a long slow swim in the sea . I do n't think it 's fair to burst in on Robert now . You see , there are rules of decorum which I do find it necessary to keep . p. 58 REICHENTHAL Why did I ever have to set eyes on you , Jamie Knox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest in back of the house , dark and mysterious , sweet smelling , dappled by light . People appear and disappear from behind trees into several small clearings . Jamie and Robert walking ; Robert carries the baby in his arms . KNOX Why , I wonder , did she decide to have it ? That child , I mean . BLAZE It 's strange . KNOX It seemed all right for a while , possible , but now . . . BLAZE She 's become a prisoner of her past , as if some strong hand reached up and yanked her back . KNOX She 's all but abandoned it . BLAZE Rachel is working with her . KNOX She wo n't even touch it . BLAZE It 's a slow process . KNOX She flips whenever she hears it . BLAZE I have enormous faith in Rachel 's powers . KNOX Meanwhile , you 've become a dedicated nursemaid . BLAZE It 's odd . I 've fallen in love with this child . I never paid much attention to Rachel when she was this age . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She was so quick and snotty . p. 60 KNOX Why the hell did n't she abort that child ? So that you could experience all the joys of fatherhood , in your dotage ? BLAZE That 's rather extreme . I 'm hardly feeble-minded yet . KNOX Why did n't she get rid of it ? BLAZE to the baby Do n't listen to him . to Jamie She thought he might be a love child . She thought she might have been pregnant before they raped her with the child of a man she loved who most likely has been killed in the war . Now , it torments her that she ca n't pick him up . She says she 'll give him to me . KNOX For all practical purposes , she already has . You hardly ever put him down . BLAZE I ca n't take my eyes off him . It 's the most astonishing feeling . When I look into this baby 's eyes I can see him seeing himself being seen . I feel as though I am giving birth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am giving birth to him by my act of looking . Inside my look , he finds the power to make himself and , at the same time , I 'm allowed to watch while this happens . My look is the womb in which he is able to grow his own idea of what it is to be him . I shudder when I think what the looks must have been like in the eyes of the young men who forced his life onto Admira . Somehow , by looking , I feel I am also redeeming them , or , at least , perhaps I am softening that memory transmitted to him through the traumatized flesh of his mother . This boy who has only a mob of crazed warrior kids for a father . This child of the twentieth century . p. 61 KNOX Very eloquent . BLAZE You 're jealous , Jamie . KNOX I 'm against jealousy on principle . BLAZE So are we all , on principle . Still , there is a father/son aspect to our relationship . One could say it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathered you , too . BLAZE now , I have seem to have a new child . KNOX I believe in every human being 's inalienable right to maintain as many loves as he or she can satisfy at any one time . BLAZE I see . Then surely you 'll let me have a baby . silence BLAZE Let me put him down . He 's sleeping . KNOX Go ahead . He lays the child on the ground BLAZE There , now . silence BLAZE You 've always initiated our love making . KNOX Perhaps you should try . BLAZE Do you remember before Admira and Rachel came we spent the entire day here in this grove . We were insatiable . Like centaurs , I said , animal bodies with men 's heads . We whinnied and pawed at the ground . You were my Orpheus , I said . And I " a tree rising . What pure growing ! /Orpheus is singing ! A tree inside the ear . " p. 62 KNOX Very nice .

" KNOX I 've always found your translations of Rilke even more strikingly effete than the originals . BLAZE Effete ? That 's ridiculous . Those are muscular lines . Sometimes I think you 're not much of a critic . KNOX Effete from effetus . " Worn out by childbearing . " BLAZE Jamie , let me touch you . KNOX Take me . BLAZE Take you ? KNOX Take me anyway you want . BLAZE Anyway I want ? KNOX Ravage me . Here on this ground . Jamie stands like stone KNOX Go ahead . Robert kisses Jamie . Jamie does n't move p. 63 KNOX Do it to me for a change . BLAZE What an odd thing to say . KNOX Is it ? BLAZE Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try . BLAZE Are you playing some sort of a game ? KNOX Not exactly . BLAZE Let 's talk . KNOX Talk . Talk . I 'm sick of talk . BLAZE Well , then , let me hold you . You must tell me what 's wrong . Surely , it 's not just the baby . KNOX Our life is so changed . BLAZE Believe me , I know . Sybil used to be able to tend her bees and keep house for us . Now I 'm taking care of a baby ; you 're doing the cooking . They 've domesticated us . KNOX All for Admira 's sake . BLAZE I suppose so , yes . KNOX Admira is controlling all of us . BLAZE She was so brutally controlled , now her needs must take precedent . p. 64 KNOX It 's hard . That 's all . It makes everyone irritable all the time . BLAZE It is eerie , is n't it . With Admira one always feels a bomb is waiting to go off . KNOX I think that bomb has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be coy with me , Robert , I really ca n't stand it . BLAZE Coy ? KNOX I know what you 're writing . BLAZE Do you ? I can hardly tell . The images have a life of their own . KNOX You 're just not man enough to act on your feelings . You know what ? You disgust me , Robert . BLAZE Do n't say that . KNOX Why not . It 's true . You 're weak . You have no courage . BLAZE Do n't say such things . KNOX Why do n't you take her if you want her so much . BLAZE Who ? What are you talking about ? KNOX Admira . That 's who . BLAZE Take her ? You 're crazy . Jamie slaps him p. 65 BLAZE What 's come over you ? KNOX Do n't call me crazy . BLAZE Do n't ever hit me again . KNOX Do n't lie to me , then . First of all , do n't lie to yourself . BLAZE I do n't know what you 're talking about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . . . KNOX Wounded women , you ca n't resist them . The Dora Deming syndrome . I 've been studying it . I can tolerate anything from you except dishonesty . BLAZE You 've flipped out . The tension of this house has gone to your head . Jamie grabs Robert KNOX You 're in love with her and you do n't know it . I am crazy . You 're driving me crazy . He throws Robert to the ground KNOX Do n't you see how it 's hurting me ? How it 's making me act ? Do n't you see it . BLAZE Jamie . Jamie . KNOX Say it . Tell me the truth . " I want her " say that . " I want her so much I ca n't help myself . " Say it , goddamn it , say it . Tell me you dream about her . Tell me you want to fuck her . p. 66 BLAZE Who are you ? What has happened to you ? KNOX I ca n't respect you . You do n't respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're a coward , Robert . Why do n't you take her , if you want her . Take her if you want her so much . Tell the truth for a change . Get up . Robert grabs Jamie ; they fight . Robert pins Jamie . KNOX Get off of me . He does BLAZE You 're not yourself . Your whole body feels changed . You ca n't mean what you said . The words you used . KNOX This place is a mad house . There 's too much pain . BLAZE Do n't you see , we 're all in the grip of what was done to her . Her torturers have crawled inside our flesh . KNOX Rachel loves me . BLAZE Do n't say that . KNOX Why not . It 's true . BLAZE Perhaps . But I do n't want to know . KNOX You ca n't hide from reality all the time . BLAZE You 're wrong about my feelings for Admira . I feel for her , yes , who would n't ? And Rachel also needs comfort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 67 KNOX I want her . I ca n't stop myself . BLAZE Do n't say that . KNOX I ca n't lie to you , Robert . BLAZE She 's my daughter . KNOX So what ? She 's an adult . BLAZE Why do you want to hurt me so much ? KNOX I want to give her some pleasure . She 's suffered too much . I feel possessed . And I must tell you the truth . BLAZE Fine . Now get a grip on yourself . KNOX Do you think I have n't tried ? I 've tried . The denial , the game , is driving me mad . BLAZE What do you expect me to do ? KNOX Stay out of our way . There , I 've said it . Forgive me . I do n't mean to be brutal . BLAZE No ? KNOX Give us room . Rachel deserves something good . BLAZE Oh , yes , without question . KNOX So , there , you see , that 's how it is . BLAZE You accuse me because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 68 KNOX I have the courage to say what I want . BLAZE Get out of my sight . Jamie goes . Robert lets out a huge , animal bellow , a wounded bull . If there is an INTERMISSION this is where it comes . Rachel enters . REICHENTHAL Do n't make that awful sound . BLAZE Do n't judge me , Rachel . REICHENTHAL What did he tell you ? BLAZE What do you think ? REICHENTHAL It 's not true . I promise you there is nothing between us . BLAZE Do n't lie to me . REICHENTHAL Nothing has happened , father . Nothing will . BLAZE You 're a hero , home from the war . Naturally , he would fall in love with you . But how could you do this to me ? REICHENTHAL I 've done nothing to you . BLAZE Do n't lie , Rachel . It does n't suit . REICHENTHAL Father , believe me , there is nothing between us . BLAZE You might as well have made love with him all last night . You might as well be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't and I wo n't . BLAZE I do n't believe you . I ca n't believe you . REICHENTHAL You wo n't believe me . BLAZE He 's mad for you . He 's possessed . How did it happen ? Who did that ? REICHENTHAL It 's not my fault . BLAZE What do you want me to believe ? That I 'm too old for him ? That he needs some young blood ? REICHENTHAL That 's disgusting . He disgusts me if he says that . BLAZE At least admit that you love him . At least give me that . You 've been brutalized by what you 've seen . He 's gentle and kind . You 're both young . It 's inevitable . I understand . REICHENTHAL Will you shut up . Your sexual libertarianism is really too much . silence REICHENTHAL You 're terribly hurt . BLAZE You love him , do n't you ? . I can see it in your eyes . REICHENTHAL There is nothing between Jamie and me . There wo n't be . BLAZE Why not admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much . It 's natual . It 's normal . It 's human . You 're attracted to him and he 's taken it to heart . p. 70 REICHENTHAL A new love drama , that 's what you want . BLAZE We simply have to be adult about all of this . REICHENTHAL Another sickeningly gooey " love " triangle of the Dora Deming variety only the roles are slightly changed . You 've thrown your own daughter into the boiling pot . BLAZE Why not ? It 's a new age with a new plot . Why should n't my daughter dare fall in love with her father 's lover ? Why should n't we deal with this new complication of the heart . REICHENTHAL Because I wo n't give you the satisfaction of turning every complex human encounter into adolescent passion stew . If it 's really going to be a new age all you flower children ought to grow up . BLAZE We could revert to the past . I could drive a knife through your throat , you moralistic little twit . REICHENTHAL Go ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than sacrificed on the altar of your uncontrollable libido . BLAZE You 'll live to regret those words . As if passion can be controlled . As if it should . REICHENTHAL Yes . Threaten me . Because I wo n't do what you want . Because I wo n't destroy myself by falling in love with a homosexual . p. 71 BLAZE He 's bi-sexual . REICHENTHAL " Bi-sexual " is just another word for totally irresponsible . BLAZE You are the most narrow-minded young woman I have ever met . REICHENTHAL Mother was bi-sexual . BLAZE You 'll end up doing far more harm than good . REICHENTHAL She killed herself . BLAZE I know , Rachel . I 'm sorry about that . REICHENTHAL I 'm not . I 'm furious . BLAZE What gives you the idea that your self-righteous rage is more benign than my addiction to intimacy , to love ? You brought your rage into my house and ruined my life . REICHENTHAL Why do n't you wake up and join the twentieth century . You live on an island where you invent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here men are cutting off other men 's testicles and disemboweling pregnant women . I have a right to my rage . I have a right to rub your nose in it anytime I please . BLAZE And I have a right to a vision of another way of being , were every passion flourishes and people are kind to one another precisely because they 've been freed from the anti-life morality of fanatics of every persuasion . p. 72 REICHENTHAL Sure , but do n't be so squeamish when a little reality forces its way into your romantic bliss . BLAZE I can take it , Rachel . The real question is whether or not you with your addiction to righteous misery can tolerate a little happiness . It 's not a sin , you know . REICHENTHAL You 're forcing me on Jamie . BLAZE No , I 'm not . REICHENTHAL Why ? Why ? I do n't understand you at all . Why do n't you protect yourself ? BLAZE I do n't know . I 've never been very good at that . I suppose I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You never protected me . You never set limits . I always felt like an experiment of yours and mother 's . BLAZE You 've turned out quite well , Rachel . I 'm proud of you . REICHENTHAL Well , thanks . BLAZE You 're welcome . REICHENTHAL So let 's not speak any more about Jamie Knox . BLAZE No , except that he 's in love with you and I just want to know if you return the feeling . p. 73 REICHENTHAL You ca n't stop , can you ? You never could . It 's disgusting . BLAZE Look we 're all living at rather close quarters on this island . I do n't want to play the fool . REICHENTHAL And I do n't want to end up a hysterical lump on the floor so that you and Jamie Knox can glory in a new drama that makes you suffer then draws you closer and leaves me out just like I 've been left out all my life . BLAZE This is the revenge plot for your mother 's suicide . REICHENTHAL I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind besides sex . BLAZE You 've always been so quick to judge . So quick that you have no life . REICHENTHAL Quick ? I 've had years of practice , do n't you think . I grew up in your house . Tell me how happy it was . BLAZE Happy ? Happy ? You want to be happy ? You grew up in a house alive with poetry , passion , love . I loved your mother . I treated her like a goddess . Like a goddess she had room to roam , to explore , to be . I never felt I owned her . I did n't want to own her . I wanted to adventure through life with her . We did that . She and I. We were free . And we made art from every hurt , from every experience we made something beautiful not only for ourselves , but for the world . We pushed forward the boundaries of the possible . We made everyday life wildly exciting . And human love heroic . What did you learn from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfrighteousness . How to cling to misery , war and violence . p. 74 REICHENTHAL I 'm not a poet , I 'm a human rights worker . BLAZE Then give yourself some human rights . Give yourself the right to admit your passion . REICHENTHAL My passion really pales in the face of the cruelty in the world . Maybe it was all right for your generation to indulge every sexual whim but aside from the obvious physical danger of such a life style now , I must say that what compels me most is not sex but the hope that I could make some small difference in the balance of terror which currently controls the world . I simply do n't think the best way to accomplish my aim is by fucking my father 's boyfriend no matter how pleasurable it might feel for twenty minutes . But I am not a prude . You 're wrong if you think I ca n't imagine pleasure . You 're wrong if you think I ca n't love only I do n't intend to upset everyone 's life because of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REICHENTHAL Oh , yes . You ca n't bear to look , can you ? Not at real suffering . You like to manufacture esthetic grief . But you ca n't bear the real stuff . People whose lives have really been destroyed through absolutely no fault of their own . BLAZE Suddenly there 's an enemy behind every tree . p. 75 REICHENTHAL At least Jamie has the grace to end your charade . BLAZE You do love him . I know you do . Oh , Rachel . Rachel . How could you ? REICHENTHAL How could I what ? BLAZE Fall in love with Jamie . How could you do that ? REICHENTHAL Stop it . You 're driving me mad . BLAZE Do n't lie to me any longer . The damage is already done . He 's treating me like a stranger . You might as well live your passion out . I give you my blessing . I promise you , it will be worse if you do n't . REICHENTHAL Where 's the baby . BLAZE He 's over there , on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BLAZE He 's an infant . REICHENTHAL You 're not fit to have a child . You never were . You make me sick to my stomach . Robert slaps her . BLAZE There 's my blessing . Go give yourself to Jamie Knox . You are the only person I know who is more calculating than he is . REICHENTHAL I 'm taking the baby back to the house . She picks up the baby and leaves . Another part of the forest . Sybil is painting . Admira is sitting. p. 76 ISMIC What are you painting , Sybil ? BLAZE I 'm painting your inner demons . ISMIC Those are your inner demons , Sybil . My demons are not so inner . They are all on the flesh . BLAZE You will have a full life . ISMIC How can you say that ? BLAZE What is a full life but a life lived down to the bone . You should paint . ISMIC I ca n't paint anymore . My hands do n't know how . BLAZE I did n't paint before . ISMIC Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISMIC I heard it in you . The branch snaps . BLAZE The beasts that enter one 's dreams , you can paint those . ISMIC I have no dreams . BLAZE You do n't know what you dream . ISMIC I do n't want to know any more . I want to be left alone . BLAZE But they are everywhere . I see them everywhere I go . Cold eyes looking down . There is nothing in those eyes . I am painting them so they will leave us alone . p. 77 ISMIC Do n't say such things . BLAZE You brought them here . They are all around us in the air . ISMIC You have all tried so hard . But they will kill you , too . BLAZE I 'm painting to tie them down . To give them a place to go . I have hundreds of paintings like this . I paint all the time . I never show them to anyone . But your demons are not mine . ISMIC I was happy when I died . I looked down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I heard the laughter of men . I do n't want to live again . BLAZE I do n't know what colors to use . ISMIC I want to kill the child , too . BLAZE Of course you do . ISMIC I want the child dead . It would be better for him . Then I could rest . I begged him not to join the fight . I pleaded with him . He had to he said . He had to try to save something of what we had . He was also a writer . Like Robert . I hope he has died . We used to be happy . We drank wine . We talked . We held hands . Walked . Rachel is distraught . She enters with the child REICHENTHAL Take the baby , Admira. p. 78 ISMIC No . REICHENTHAL Hold your son . ISMIC Do n't . He 's not mine . REICHENTHAL Yes he is ; I want you to take him . ISMIC Go away . Ca n't you see anything . They are everywhere . All around . REICHENTHAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sybil , me and the baby . BLAZE Stop , Rachel . REICHENTHAL No . It 's time . She has to touch him . She has to connect . She 's done enough damage to herself . BLAZE Enough ? Rachel , enough ! Sybil approaches Rachel , takes the child REICHENTHAL I want you to speak . I want you to tell me what you remember . ISMIC You do n't want to know . REICHENTHAL I ca n't stand the silence anymore . ISMIC I ca n't tell you . REICHENTHAL You must . ISMIC I ca n't speak before you . You are like a nun . You are too good . p. 79 REICHENTHAL I 'm not going to let you destroy yourself . Do you understand ? I want you to tell me everything . ISMIC I 'm dead . The dead do n't speak . REICHENTHAL shakes Admira by the shoulders You 're alive , dammit . You 're alive . You 're alive and you 're going to talk . BLAZE Rachel ! Rachel pushes Admira away . Admira falls to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says softly under her breath REICHENTHAL Oh , my god , oh , my god , oh , my god . I could kill her . BLAZE You see how they get inside of us . REICHENTHAL I could wring her neck . Help me . Somebody help me . BLAZE I must paint them . Rachel exits Sybil sits on her stool , rocking back and forth with the child on her lap ISMIC I want to kill my child . BLAZE I know , child . I know that . ISMIC No one should live . Not anymore . Beasts . Only monsters should walk the earth . He is too weak . I wo n't let him . I wo n't allow it . They took babies by their heals , hit their heads against rock . I saw what came out . p. 80 BLAZE I did . I did it . No one believed me . It was an accident . The wall came out of nowhere . I turned right into it . I had my foot on the gas . The air smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could smell her sweet flesh . ISMIC They did it all in front of everyone . They took four of us . In front of everyone . On the ground . They did it . Everyone saw it . No one moved . BLAZE It was a long time ago . Before even Rachel was born . Then no one could believe such things . I did n't believe it myself . Even with my black eyes , I could n't see . Now people try to believe . They read in the newspapers . They see on the television . ISMIC I itched so . The smell . I could n't stand the smell . They made me smell like that . I ca n't say these things to anyone . I want to shout . All the time I want to shout . I am so dirty inside . I must be dead . No one lives with so much dirt . BLAZE She used to talk in poetry . She said to me when she was three and a half , " mama , where do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the earth to dance with the dead bones . " When she was just two , she asked : " Mama , why does n't light always come colored like in rainbows ? " I wrote the things she said down in my head . They were going to take her away from me . They were going to take her away . Because I watched him one night from the door , when he hurt her . I watched . My tongue turned to ash in my mouth . p. 81 ISMIC I wanted to kill them all . I want to go back and I want to kill . I want to kill everyone who looked at me . Everyone who watched . Everyone who knows anything . Rachel knows too much . Some nights I want to take a knife . I want to cut out her heart . So she 'll know . So she 'll know what it felt like . BLAZE Robert was already a poet when her words stopped . I thought that a big fist was behind us pushing us . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lap and cling . She would hold onto my knees all the time . She had been free . Now I saw how he had stopped her . He had put a big fist in her mouth . No one would believe . I did n't believe myself . It was n't my life . ISMIC I knew them . I knew them because I had taught one year in their village . They were village boys . They used to do the things village boys do . It was so strange that I knew them . Ordinary boys . I knew one or two of their names . They looked in my eyes . No . I am dead . No one survives . BLAZE My husband said I was crazy . He said I made everything up . For a long time I did n't know the truth . He said they were going to take her away from me because I was making her crazy . I knew something else . But I did n't know how to say it out loud . I was afraid he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again on the head , afraid he would use his gun . p. 82 ISMIC I did n't mind for me . I was dead already . But I saw what they did to the others . To young girls and old woman . And their eyes were so cold . They had no life in their eyes . A mother held her child to protect him . To protect him , she held him tight . So they could n't take him away , she wrapped her arms around his chest . She held him tight to protect him . While she held him ; they cut his head off . BLAZE It was not an accident . No . I planned it all . I planned it when I saw the wall . I put my foot on the gas . I thought I would run the wall through both of us . I never saw her again . They would n't let me go to her funeral . They sent me away to live with Robert . My teeth were scattered across the cement . I saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ISMIC If it was for myself , I could stand anything . But for the others , for them , I could n't help . I was too dirty to live . I knew this man . He was a high school teacher of mine . He was dripping with blood . He held a knife in his hand . He looked at me in the eyes . " Now you see how strong I am . " I was dead already I had died so all I could do was hang from the top of the ceiling and look down . BLAZE That 's how I learned to keep bees . Dora bought me a hive . Dora was always very good to me . I found out that bees live the same way in captivity or in the wild . No one has ever been able to change the essence of bees . All we have ever been able to do is steal their honey , but the bees go on being bees just the same as always . They live as if they were free . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up dances . In times long ago , people used to understand the language of bees but now we 've forgotten how to understand them . Suddenly , the sound of Robert 's flute . He is playing as he wanders around the forest . Admira drops off to sleep . As this happens , in another clearing in the woods , Rachel runs into Jamie. p. 83 REICHENTHAL I do n't care , anymore . I love you . KNOX I love you . REICHENTHAL There I 've said it . KNOX We 'll take the child and go . I 'll rub your breasts until they give milk . We could take Admira . If you want to . Our love will heal her . We 'll go somewhere beautiful . REICHENTHAL Quiet , do n't talk . KNOX We are somewhere beautiful . REICHENTHAL I thought so . KNOX You are beautiful . REICHENTHAL I tried so hard not to want you . KNOX Today I think I 'm crazy . I 'm crazy with longing . REICHENTHAL I 'm going mad . I 'll go mad if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of your neck ? REICHENTHAL If you promise me you wo n't stop . KNOX I 'll kiss you all over . I 'll kiss all the pain out of you . He kisses her softly on the neck Rachel , brave Rachel . I 'll be so careful . Rachel takes Jamie 's hand , leads him out of sight . Robert walks into the grove where Sybil is seated and Admira sleeps. p. 84 BLAZE She 's sleeping . BLAZE Sweet oblivion . BLAZE The earth shifted . BLAZE She reminds me of Dora , somehow , when I see her like that . He kneels next to her , touches her lightly on the neck . BLAZE How does one live without touch ? BLAZE Bees . BLAZE You never wanted something else , Sybil , after it was all in the past ? BLAZE I wanted to see you happy , Robert . You and Rachel . But I am afraid of Jamie Knox . BLAZE So am I , Sybil . I 'm afraid of what he makes me feel . BLAZE I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not like us . He has n't suffered enough . BLAZE That 's why I loved him , at first . BLAZE He will destroy Rachel . BLAZE Rachel will destroy Rachel , I 'm afraid . BLAZE It 's not right that the innocent are not saved , that the innocent are sacrificed all the time . p. 85 BLAZE It 's hardest thing to accept . One must bow one 's head . BLAZE Admira was hurting no one . She was minding her own business . Rachel wants me to suck the pain out of her . she spits on the ground Such poison is in the world . I 've grown fat on it . BLAZE At least she 's sleeping . BLAZE Rachel believes we can act against evil . Rachel believes in human beings , in the power of the rational mind . That 's why she 'll be destroyed . Here . She hands the child to Robert , gets up and goes BLAZE If I can just rest here awhile , next to you , dear , in the sun . Admira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been sleeping . ISMIC Oh , Robert how sad you are . BLAZE I think so . ISMIC I bring such suffering here . I should go . I should take away my child . BLAZE This island is your home as long as you want to be here . It 's your home and your child 's . ISMIC Can I have my son ? I woke up wanting to hold him . I think I had a dream . p. 86 BLAZE Here he is . Robert puts the baby in her arms ISMIC It 's not so hard to hold him . BLAZE No , it 's not hard . ISMIC I did n't know . Sometimes he looked like them . Sometimes like the other one . I could n't tell . But Jamie does n't have a father . BLAZE Maybe I should try to be Rachel 's father for a change . ISMIC It sounds simple as it should be . But nothing is so simple in the flesh . So you are sad . BLAZE I am . ISMIC I 'm sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . BLAZE You are very wise . ISMIC Wise ? No , but now I can look through people . It 's like an ex-ray machine , my eyes , I look in . I ca n't help myself . I would rather not . Hush , now , my sweet child . Rachel calling as she enters REICHENTHAL Admira . BLAZE Rachel . REICHENTHAL Father . BLAZE I 'm sorry . p. 87 REICHENTHAL Do n't be . BLAZE I 'm sorry I slapped you . REICHENTHAL It 's all right . BLAZE I 'm sorry I doubted you . REICHENTHAL Can we talk about something else . BLAZE I think Jamie should leave . REICHENTHAL It 's quite all right with me to have him here . BLAZE He made me turn on you . I 've never hit anyone in my life . REICHENTHAL It 's all right . I was wrong to be angry with you , Admira . Please forgive me . ISMIC Look , I 'm holding my child . REICHENTHAL Admira , oh , look , I did n't even see . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my friend . You have suffered so much because of me . I am worried for you . I need to go change him . REICHENTHAL I 'll take him . ISMIC No , please , let me . Sybil will help me . Admira exits BLAZE Jamie made me doubt your integrity . p. 88 REICHENTHAL Father , please . BLAZE He can be gone in a day or two . REICHENTHAL You need n't do it for me . I 'll be leaving soon myself . BLAZE Jamie should go at once . We should be together as father and daughter for a change . Is n't that what you want ? REICHENTHAL I do n't know . It seems late to start . BLAZE How can you want him to stay after what he 's done to us ? REICHENTHAL It 's just . . . I do n't know . . . Do what you want to do . You always do in any case . Rachel leaves . Jamie enters behind her. @x Admira is dressed in black . She is sitting in a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sea . Rachel is with her . The sound of the ocean intensifies , a storm is coming up . REICHENTHAL All right , Admira , here 's some nice warm soup . I want you to take the spoon . Admira takes the spoon and throws it REICHENTHAL Then , I 'll have to feed you . Come on , Admira , it 's pistou . Jamie made it and you like it . Remember the first time we had it for dinner , you said you would like to learn how to cook this . It 's full of fresh basil and ripe tomatoes from the garden . Rachel eats a spoonful It 's delicious . ISMIC Let me see it . Rachel shows her the bowl ISMIC Give it to me . I want to smell it . Rachel hands Admira the bowl ; she smells it , blows on it , and then dumps it down the front of her dress . ISMIC I do n't want your food . REICHENTHAL It 's not my food , Admira . ISMIC Covered in filth . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISMIC Look . REICHENTHAL Admira , I 'm a person , like you are . We do n't always act in ways that please one another . But you 're not punishing me by not eating . You 're hurting yourself and your baby . ISMIC I 'm dirty . You ca n't see . REICHENTHAL You were so much better , Admira . What happened to you ? ISMIC To you . What happened to you . REICHENTHAL I thought I could have something I needed for myself . I thought you were strong enough . Maybe I did n't think very much . I 'm sorry . ISMIC Sorry . REICHENTHAL Sorry if I 've upset you . Sorry , yes . ISMIC I do n't what care what you do . It does n't matter to me what happens to you . REICHENTHAL Well it matters to me what happens to you . I do n't want you to ruin your health . ISMIC You use me to make yourself feel good . People like you need to feel good about themselves . You pick us up out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You hold us together for awhile with your hands . All the time , you are thinking how good you are . How much better than we are you are . p. 92 REICHENTHAL That 's not true . ISMIC How privileged you have been . How chosen . Still , you have trouble feeling like a person . So you find someone who has been shamed . Someone who smells bad . And you say to yourself , " look how kind I am . Look how good . " But it is still a lie . You still do n't feel whole . You still feel rotten on the inside . REICHENTHAL I feel rotten because you wo n't eat . That 's why I feel bad . ISMIC Do n't worry about me . I 'm done needing people to worry about me . It 's no way to live . REICHENTHAL I wo n't worry anymore , if you will take some food . ISMIC I 'm not in my body anymore . I pretend . REICHENTHAL You 're sitting right in front of me . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm saying through you ears . ISMIC That 's because you do n't know anything . Rachel touches her hand REICHENTHAL This is your body , Admira . You can feel my hand . ISMIC You can do anything you want to me . I do n't feel anything . Not your dirty hand . p. 93 REICHENTHAL I just want to give you some food . ISMIC I ca n't eat because my mouth is gone . REICHENTHAL You 're talking through your mouth right now . You can eat through your mouth , too . ISMIC My mouth is not mine . REICHENTHAL It 's been a week since you 've had solid food . Three days , Admira , since you 've had any water . I know because I 've been watching you around the clock . I 'm very tired now . You must be very weak . ISMIC I am strong like a bull . REICHENTHAL You were getting strong . Remember ? You were strong enough to swim in the sea . Would you like to swim , again , Admira ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish with poison in its tale . REICHENTHAL I know you 're very angry at me . You have a right to be angry if that 's the way you feel . But you 're only punishing yourself by refusing to eat . ISMIC I want to hurt . REICHENTHAL But none of us deserves to be punished . You do n't deserve to punish yourself . ISMIC I want revenge . p. 94 REICHENTHAL Starving yourself is not the way to accomplish that . You need to get strong then you can come testify at the war crimes tribunal . You could help all the women . ISMIC I want revenge but you wo n't let me have what I want so I left myself . REICHENTHAL Look , if you wo n't eat , we 're going to have to force feed you . Do you know what that means ? ISMIC Go away . REICHENTHAL Sybil will call the doctor and he will pry your mouth open and run a tube down your throat . Do you want her to do that ? ISMIC You understand none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bed so you do n't pull the tube out . Do you want us to torture you like they did , Admira ? Why do you want us to do that ? ISMIC I am gone . Jamie enters KNOX Hey , I worked hard making that soup . There 's more in the kitchen when you 're ready . It smells really good , does n't it ? She is silent REICHENTHAL Shall I get another bowl from the kitchen , Admira ? Would you take some ? Admira is silent p. 95 KNOX You 've got to eat , you know . Everyone has to . silence REICHENTHAL I 'm at my wits end . KNOX Poor Rachel . REICHENTHAL You were with my father last night . KNOX He wanted to talk . REICHENTHAL What did you say ? KNOX Look , nobody said it would n't be difficult . REICHENTHAL I promised myself , I 'd never play their game . KNOX " Their game " ? You are the eternal cynic . REICHENTHAL What do you want me to call it ? KNOX How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How about insane . KNOX We can stop anytime . REICHENTHAL We can stop . Admira can eat . Why do n't we do it ? Why do n't you eat your soup for god 's sake ? KNOX Here he comes . Lets go for a swim . Come on , before you totally lose it . Robert enters ; eating chocolate . He hands one to Admira. p. 96 BLAZE Here 's a chocolate bar , Admira . Bittersweet . Eat . KNOX We 're going swimming . BLAZE The wind is up . REICHENTHAL We 'll be fine . BLAZE You have each other . REICHENTHAL Father . . . BLAZE I 've been thinking that perhaps we could work out a schedule so we wo n't be getting in one another 's way . That must be the civilized thing to do in such a case as ours . It 's a pity the house is so small . Did you know that chocolate produces the same hormonal changes in the body as being in love ? Eat your chocolate , Admira , it 's good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hand in hand . Robert sits down next to her chair . BLAZE I used to believe in the nobility of the human project . I believed that the human being 's ability to create beauty , had secured us a necessary place on the earth . I believed that poetry is rooted in love , and love in desire , and desire in hope of continued existence . I believed poetry alone could transmute pain . Everything ugly and base , everything cruel beyond comprehension could be washed clean by the creative act . So you see , they 've taken my work from me . They ca n't help it . Rachel is starved . She has starved herself . It 's dangerous , Admira , to deny the self . p. 97 ISMIC I am hungry for one thing , Robert , only . BLAZE I would like to take revenge against both of them . I would like to break their happiness as mine was broken . ISMIC I want to raise my son to take revenge for me . I want to raise him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no peace . BLAZE A storm is coming up . ISMIC I want to raise my son to be a killer . BLAZE They 've gone swimming in this weather . ISMIC My son will avenge my honor , the honor of my people . He will wash the stain from his mother . BLAZE I should give them my blessing . I 've cursed them . Yes , I 've cursed them a thousand times . I should write a play in which they both die because of my curse and I am suddenly seized by remorse ; I learn by suffering but only when it is too late . I learn what I 've lost over the mutilated bodies of the two I cursed . Or maybe only she dies and he returns to me , full of remorse for what he 's done , but by then it does n't matter anymore . Happiness is beyond us . Grief for our loss is all we can share . I send him away . He goes as an exile to atone . I imagine their naked bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see their love . It 's as if I am sleeping with her myself . Of course , they know that . They 've whispered about it to themselves , maybe they 've even laughed out loud . There is nothing more exciting than the laughter of guilty lovers . It 's despicable to grow old . My flesh smells rotten . I should n't be telling you this . It 's bad for you , I 'm sure . p. 98 ISMIC So I must die . If I do n't die I will make my son into a murderer . There is no other way . BLAZE But if your pain is the only real pain then what is this thing I 'm feeling ? ISMIC When I go away from my body I stop wanting my son to kill for me . You must listen to what I am saying . BLAZE If I could make them suffer . If I can kill what is happy in them . ADMIRA If I die , my son can live . He wo n't have to grow up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to remember . BLAZE Admira , what are you talking about ? ISMIC If I die , he can live . He wo n't have to carry my rage . BLAZE My god . Admira , listen to what you are saying . ISMIC What am I saying , Robert . What ? I want to die to protect him from me . I want to die . Let him live . Pretend he is clean . You can pretend that for him . BLAZE You have to tell him that yourself . He will have to hear that from you . You will tell him you were innocent , that he is innocent , too . ISMIC All I could see , Robert . All I could see . Suddenly all I could see were swollen bellies . In the room all around were women crying . I was one of their voices . All alone , shivering . But all I could see were bellies heaving . Like the bellies of the sea . Swollen sea bellies . And the sea was singing to us ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted sea salt in my mouth . I can not explain what I saw . We were each one of us waves , all the women alone in that room were like the waves on the sea ; I saw it all in that moment . I remember I said to myself , " I am going to live . " That is my story , too , is n't it , Robert ? p. 99 BLAZE A storm is coming up . He grabs her hand They should n't be swimming . Come with me . I ca n't face them alone . They exit . Sybil enters , a piece of paper in her hand . BLAZE I 've been praying for a miracle . Now it 's come . God bless the fax machine . The sea is up . There 's going to be a storm . KNOX dripping wet from the ocean Where is she , Sybil ? Where 's Rachel ? BLAZE I thought she was panting after you . KNOX She swam away from me . I had no idea she could swim so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert &amp; Admira enter BLAZE Where is she , you bastard ? KNOX I 've lost her . BLAZE I 'll kill you with my bare hands . I swear it . If something 's happened to Rachel , I 'll pull you apart limb from limb . KNOX I thought she must have came back here . BLAZE She was in no condition to go swimming . No one 's been sleeping . There 's a storm coming . p. 100 KNOX She was swimming too fast for me . She simply vanished . I yelled for her . I had to turn back . The waves were too high . BLAZE I know the sea when the season turns . It 's treacherous . KNOX Why did n't you warn us ? BLAZE It seemed fitting . KNOX She 'll be all right . BLAZE Dora drowned herself in the fall . Dora complicated her life beyond endurance . Then she told me she was going swimming . KNOX My god . BLAZE You know all of this . You 're writing her godamned biography . You dragged Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so rough . BLAZE You want life to imitate your miserable art . You want to be able to call the shots . KNOX It 's not true . BLAZE Demigods . Puffed up . I know the type . We 're all alike . KNOX You 're not making sense . BLAZE What are you doing to us ? KNOX I never thought she 'd swim straight out . I tried to follow , then , suddenly , I could n't see her anymore . p. 101 BLAZE If you 've drowned my child I 'll wring your miserable neck . You charlatan . You gigolo . KNOX If anything has happened to Rachel , I 'll never forgive myself . BLAZE I 'll kill you with my own hands . KNOX Go ahead . Do it . It 's my fault . Suddenly , Admira begins ravenously to eat her chocolate bar Sybil enters , breaking into Robert &amp; Jamie 's fight . BLAZE Rachel 's gone . BLAZE What do you mean , gone ? BLAZE Left . BLAZE Tell me the truth . BLAZE Fled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bag in a hurry . KNOX Where is she ? BLAZE Already on the ferry . A fax came to the house . She read it and left . BLAZE Thank god , she 's safe . KNOX She went back to the war . ISMIC I must go . p. 102 BLAZE takes her hand No , dear , you must n't . BLAZE Rachel is needed to gather facts . BLAZE Your home is here , Admira , as long as you want it . Look , you 've got chocolate all over your face . He wipes her mouth KNOX Robert , forgive me . BLAZE It tastes good , does n't it ? KNOX Robert . . . BLAZE Let 's go eat something hot . KNOX forgive me for loving you both . Robert is holding Admira 's hand in his . He looks at Jamie and almost smiles @x The house . Robert and Jamie are on either side of a table , writing . Sybil is painting at a large easel in the center of the room . A playpen full of toys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . From outside there is a tremendous , rhythmic clatter . The sound of metal hitting stone . Adding to it , the sound of the ferry horn . Everyone lost in work . KNOX It 's amazing the child can sleep . BLAZE Actually , I think he finds the noise comforting . KNOX It 's insane to try to work like this . I keep saying I 'll build myself a hut . BLAZE I find the noise comforting myself . KNOX I 'm going to do it . BLAZE In the woods . I 'll come to you . Jamie reaches across the table , puts his hand on top of Robert 's KNOX I 'm thinking of going to Paris for the winter . The men look at one another . The sound outside stops . Admira enters . Dressed in white , a white bandanna tied around her forehead , holding her sculptor 's tools . She has been carving marble outside. p. 104 ISMIC I 'm starved . But I 've found an amazing vein in the marble to expose . I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . I am calling it " The Survivors " . After supper you will look . BLAZE I 'll look now . ISMIC After we eat . Someday , maybe I can bring it home . Put it outside in a square so the children can climb on it and the doves . . . BLAZE Someday soon . KNOX Someday at sunset , we 'll have the unveiling . Drink champagne . ISMIC I 'm so hungry . BLAZE Rachel will be here in time for dinner . ISMIC We did n't tell you . BLAZE Rachel 's coming . ISMIC She asked us to keep secret . KNOX Coming here ? BLAZE Rachel ? Rachel steps in . She is very pregnant ; she stands with her hands on her belly . Everyone is silent , looking at her . BLAZE Rachel , Rachel , Rachel . Look at you . Admira has a sudden feeling of fear p. 105 ISMIC Rachel . No ! Not you . This I will not stand . Rachel goes to her ; the women embrace ; Rachel calms her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be pregnant . No one hurt me . I wrote you . You remember .

REICHENTHAL Father . BLAZE We worried about you , Rachel . REICHENTHAL I 've been working on the war crimes tribunal . Gathering testimonies from refugees . It 's important . BLAZE We missed you .
