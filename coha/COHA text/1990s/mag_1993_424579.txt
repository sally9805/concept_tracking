White House Mess Boris Yeltsin was lucky in his opponents . But whether or not his luch holds , the West needs to rethink its Eastern policy . Clausewitz would have understood . <p> LENIN would have said , I told you so . ' There are no kind ways to stage a coup . It matters not whether the coup is mounted by sitting presidents or against them , in the name of democracy or in opposition to it . Boris Yeltsin 's action on September 21 was a presidential coup . It overturned lawful , if widely loathed , authority and an established , if unworkable , constitution . Like any coup worthy of the name , it was backed by overwhelming force . <p> Clausewitz said that , though war does not have its own grammar , it has its own syntax . So it is with any kind of force , and so it was this past fortnight . At a critical point in the presidential - parliamentary struggle , Yeltsin disregarded this syntax . Miraculously , his error roused his opponents , Aleksandr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dramatic was their folly that it provided the means of Yeltsin 's deliverance . Had they desisted , Yeltsin would have had to choose between international approval and the crushing of his opponents . On Monday , October 4 , he secured both . <p> Yet the events which began with Yeltsin 's Decree No. 1400 on September 21 and which culminated with the storming of Moscow 's House of Soviets are only the first act . Rarely in history ( and never in Russia ) has a clean sweep of one 's enemies produced a clean slate . Those who gave Yeltsin his victory  --  Russia 's army and security forces  --  can not just be bowed off the stage . They are the beneficiaries of Yeltsin 's victory every bit as much as the radicals , Westernizers , and free-marketeers , and they constitute some of the most conservative , nationalistic , and disaffected portions of Russian society . What is more , their services will be needed in the future . If Yeltsin does not come to rue the price of his victory , he may rue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeltsin 's preoccupations were justifiably different . In the course of nearly two years , dvoyevlastiye  --  the diarchy of power ' between Russia 's president and Parliament  --  had given a new meaning to Lenin 's principle : What we give with one hand , we take with the other . ' During this time , Russia became a country of mafias rather than capitalists , rigged markets rather than free markets , and , as it has often been throughout history , both over-regulated and lawless . While the diarchy did not produce this condition , it made it impossible to overcome . <p> The opening moves in Yeltsin 's climactic struggle with Parliament and his own vice president , Aleksandr Rutskoi , were impeccable : far better prepared than they were on March 20 , when he last locked horns with Russia 's Supreme Soviet . Then , he and his entourage acted from weakness . This time they acted from strength . Preparing Yeltsin 's Way <p> YELTSIN 'S April 25 referendum victory was a blow which Parliament did not expect and from which it never recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the five intervening months to change the balance of forces . Through the constitutional negotiations they outmaneuvered  --  and through their financial levers they outbid  --  Parliament in cultivating regional support . By acting in defiance of parliamentary legislation , they strengthened their already considerable control over the media . Not least , they finally brought the Ministry of Defense , Ministry of Security , and Ministry of Internal Affairs ( MVD ) into line . <p> This latter development was of crucial importance . By design , the security and internal-affairs bodies have long possessed their own military establishments , independent of the Ministry of Defense : a state of affairs exemplifying the divide and rule ' principle that underpinned the Communist system . When that system collapsed , the divisions remained , but the Party leash disappeared . According to several accounts , the minister of security , Viktor Barannikov , all but vetoed a plan for emergency rule in October 1992 . During the referendum crisis of March - April 1993 , he let it be known that he was nobody 's man . <p> In July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 27 , he sacked not only Barannikov , but also his subordinate , Colonel General Shlyakhtin , the commander of Russian Federation Border Troops , as well as his ally , Andrei Dunayev , the first deputy interior minister . As Dunayev disappeared , so did the backbone of the MVD , whose minister , Viktor Yerin , has always been loyal to his keepers . Barannikov 's replacement , Nikolai Golushko , while vastly more able than Yerin , also embodied a talent for changing his spots . A thirty-year KGB professional , he chaired the Ukrainian KGB from 1987 to 1991 , then put his expertise at the service of newly independent Ukraine , and then switched horses again by becoming Barannikov 's deputy . Such figures are threats to their friends , not to their chiefs . <p> Thus , by September 21 , Yeltsin had set up his game . Not only were the power ministers ' behind him , but he had also secured pledges of loyalty from the commanders of the two airborne and two army divisions surrounding the capital , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which still bears the name of Feliks Dzerzhinsky , founder of the Cheka ) . The mayor of Moscow , Yuri Luzhkov , had long been in Yeltsin 's pocket , as was Moscow 's divisional-strength contingent of the elite special designation ' militia ( OMON ) . <p> But all of these maneuvers were based upon a gamble : that trumps plainly seen need not be played . This was a bold gamble indeed . The decree did not demand surrender , it merely assumed it . It issued no ultimata , set no deadlines , offered no terms . It simply decreed that the functions of the Supreme Soviet and Congress of People 's Deputies would stop . ' <p> For several days , it seemed that Parliament would sputter into irrelevance . Yet by the following week Parliament 's last gasp ' ( to use Yeltsin 's phrase ) was igniting brushfires , both in Moscow and in several of Russia 's economically critical regions . <p> Behind a best-case plan , there must be a worst-case plan . Yeltsin had gambled on a strategy of force without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? To all appearances , there was none . Having tightened the cordon of militia and Internal Troops after the 24th , Yeltsin thinned it out on the 29th . After his first deputy prime minister declared there could be no compromise , ' Yeltsin agreed to talks on the 30th . While the government publicly quarreled with itself over whether to concede simultaneous elections , it issued an ultimatum to the occupants of the White House . Although the ultimatum 's tone left no doubt that force would be used , its authors swore that it would not . <p> This equivocation nearly cost Yeltsin his victory . It altered a key variable of conflict , the moral correlation of forces . ' To a weak defender , there is nothing more inspiring than the irresolution of a strong attacker . In the final days of September , Yeltsin 's irresolution revived a dead cause . It also conceded that most valuable strategic commodity to his parliamentary opponents : time . Time rarely favors the attacking side , as Moscow 's wartime defenders understood . On this occasion , time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regions to organize . Inevitably , the material correlation of forces altered as well . <p> This shift in the balance of forces was most obvious in the behavior of the Federation 's 88 regions . On the 26th , 39 local-soviet leaders and a few administrative heads assembled in St. Petersburg and put forward a number of moderate proposals for resolving the crisis . On the 29th , a far more determined body assembled in Novosibirsk and issued its own ultimatum : lift the blockade , or a Siberian Republic would be established , taxes withheld , federal property confiscated , and the Trans-Siberian Railway halted . On the 30th , most of this body decamped to the Constitutional Court in Moscow and prepared to march on the White House itself . There is little wonder that Moscow 's brushfires soon became a conflagration . Nothing to Lose ? <p> YELTSIN 'S strategy ignored the first rule of conflict : Know your enemy . ' There are enemies who are rattled by intimidation and enemies who are riled by it . There are enemies who follow the principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both types were present at the White House . Understandably , the vast majority chose to bow to the balance of forces rather than test them . Some defected out of prudence , some out of political calculation , and some in the heartfelt belief that bloodshed would be tragic for Russia . A larger number simply allowed themselves to be bought . <p> But what of the rest : not only the co-founders of post-Soviet Russia , Khasbulatov and Rutskoi ( who vowed to fight to the last drop of blood ' ' ) , but Generals Achalov and Makashov , the unrepentant supporters of the August 1991 coup ? What of their praetorian guard , the hired murderers ' from Transdneistria , Abkhazia , and the dreaded Riga OMON ? Yeltsin 's supporters warned that these fighters know what it is to kill and are not traumatized by killing . ' Did they not grasp that this was an army of the futureless , composed of people who had nothing to lose and , for that reason , even more dangerous than fanatics who have a world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a hard core and knew who would constitute it . But what did he expect the defenders of the White House ' to do ? Did he expect they would be brought to their senses by candlelight , cold food , and dead telephones ? Did he really suppose that they would leave the weapons of the White House Okhrana ( Protection Directorate ) in their storerooms ? Or did he predict what Nikolai Vitruk , deputy chairman of the Constitutional Court , predicted four days before the event : Rutskoi will order an offensive , and there will be a slaughter ' ' ? <p> It is not a rhetorical question . Russians will ask it even if we refuse . Provokatsia ( provocation ) plays as large a role in Russia as pork-barrel politics does in the United States . Did Yeltsin not need a provocation ? The West 's advice  --  Be decisive , be nice '  --  could not be implemented , but had to be respected . Leaders seeking democratic legitimacy need an excuse to slaughter even their most anti-democratic opponents . Did Yeltsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mayor 's office and the television station but the latest example of what the Russian Army calls reflexive control ' ' : the science of inducing an opponent to defeat himself by his own efforts ? <p> It is most unlikely . The supposition demands too much of Yeltsin : not only too much coolness , but too much recklessness . When the group of 3,500 to 4,000 broke through the OMON cordon and , using tactics of seizure from the rear and flanks , ' liberated ' the White House on October 3 , they nearly won . Had the liberators stayed put and stayed quiet , it would have been all but impossible to reimpose a blockade of the White House , let alone storm it . Yeltsin would have been forced into a debilitating compromise . It was Rutskoi , not Yeltsin , who threw this opportunity away and launched the mob on its trajectory of destruction across Moscow . Who could be certain that he would ? Although Yeltsin is the beneficiary of Rutskoi 's folly , he is unlikely to have been its instigator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opponents to overplay their hand , but grossly misjudged their capacity to overplay it . This explanation is also consistent with the simplest : that Yeltsin underestimated the rebound of the parliamentary cause , just as Rutskoi and Khasbulatov overestimated it . Risks Ahead <p> TODAY the risk is that others might overestimate Yeltsin 's triumph . Ahead lie two imponderables : the regions and the army . <p> Thanks to the conclusiveness of Yeltsin 's Moscow victory , most regions could turn far more compliant than they have been to date . Outside the Federation 's non-Russian republics ( e.g. , Chechenia ) , regional leaders are wily vassals of the center , not principled opponents . They act according to the Russian maxim : Oppose weakness , not strength . For them a weak central power is a target of opportunity . Had Yeltsin compromised or lost , the opportunities would have been vast and the temptations irresistible . The risks of disintegration might be far greater than they are today . <p> But might ' is the operative word . Some regional authorities have already gone too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeltsin but know that they might be toppled from below if they do . The oft-cited antireformist minority of only ' 30 per cent is an average of averages , and it says nothing about the passions of the 30 per cent . In regions dependent upon heavy manufacturing , as well as the defense and energy complexes , the numbers are higher , and passions are deep . Several regional leaders may conclude that it would be better to lead a mob than be pursued by one . Should this occur , the moral correlation of forces ' could alter again . <p> Fearing these possibilities , Yeltsin may feel forced to pre-empt rather than react . Such pre-emption might not only retard democracy further but reintroduce the syntax of force . <p> Of the support given to Yeltsin by his power ministers , that pledged by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev was the most significant and the most reluctant . It is one thing to commit four elite ( and well-paid ) divisions to a one-sided assault in the capital . It is quite another to be able to predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do . For all the efforts to professionalize the Russian Army , it is still a conscript army , and it reflects the divisions of its society . It is also an unhappy army . Scarcely a single officer would dissent from the views General Achalov expressed in his last recorded interview : <p> Officers and fighters must enjoy exceptionally high prestige . . . the officer must serve the state loyally , and the state must take care of him , not only in words but in real deeds , so that when an officer runs away  --  as he was forced to by senior commanders  --  he would come , not to a tent , but to a decent flat . He must always know that when his term is up . . . he is well provided for . He should not have to go to work as a porter at a train station , a janitor , or a furnace stoker . <p> Yeltsin and his successors may have little choice but to make that program their own . If they do , they may preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will reform it according to Russian imperatives , rather than Western models . There may at last be shock therapy of a kind  --  bankruptcies , mass unemployment , the end of subsidies  --  counterbalanced by military priorities which both we and Russia 's neighbors find uncomfortable . In the future , it is likely that social protection ' will be targeted to servicemen , while words ' rather than deeds ' are found for pensioners and others who can not adapt . The equation between calm in the army and calm in the country ' may not prove conducive to calm in the ex-Soviet near abroad , ' let alone compatible with Western-style democracy . <p> This would not be a good outcome to Russia 's crisis , but it might be the best outcome possible , and it would be vastly better than several alternatives . The question is whether the West can discard its infatuation with democratic Russia ' and return to the principles of enlightened state interest that guided foreign policy before Cold Wars and Common European Homes were thought of . If post - Cold War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmness , dispassion , and respect , Russia 's patriots ' ( and many of her democrats ) would think far better of the West than they do at present . <p> This said , it is still very possible that key regions will defy Yeltsin and that the army will divide . If so , Russia will descend into its second Time of Troubles and the West will be left with a foreign-policy calamity . <p> PHOTO : Drawing of Boris Yeltsin ( ALAN NAHIGIAN ) <p> CARTOON <p> By JAMES SHERR <p> <p> Mr. Sherr is lecturer in international relations at Lincoln College , Oxford , and a research fellow at the Soviet Studies Research Center at Sandhurst . <p>
