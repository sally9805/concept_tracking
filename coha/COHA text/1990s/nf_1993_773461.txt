txt 160 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM Appropriateness of Ethics Training " Excuse me , Carl , " Sarah Stevenson interrupted , " but are n't we putting the cart before the horse ? Is n't ethics a personal matter ? Before addressing whether ethics can be taught , I 'd have questions as to whether ethics should be taught . " " A very good question , " Iverson responded . " At the risk of voicing a cliche , I 'm glad you asked it . It is something that I skipped over that we should cover now . To do so , I am going to make an important distinction , one that I want to be sure all of us keep clearly in mind throughout our discussion.3 " In my opinion , we should not , and perhaps could not even if we wished , teach moral standards of behavior , as such ? the goals , norms , beliefs , and values held by a person . These are personal and reflect the teachings and experiences of a lifetime . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say , as I 'm sure you 've heard , that you ca n't teach people ethics . They tell you that a person 's ethics is something learned at home , in church , and in school , pretty well established in a person 's early years . Trying to inculcate these by lecture would be a waste of time ? and wrong , since it would amount to little more than indoctrination . " We can appropriately , however , " Iverson continued , " teach ethical analysis . That is what we discussed ? very briefly , I 'll admit ? in our earlier discussion this morning when we considered ethical models and then went briefly through the seven-step approach I said might be used to deal with ethical dilemmas . Note that nowhere in that discussion did I endorse any particular moral standards ; instead I focused on a consideration of rights and obligations . And even there I did n't tell you ? in fact , I could n't have told you ? how to identify and value the various rights and obligations involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethical Ethics Can Be Taught / 161 analysis does not result in a teacher 's imposing his or her set of values on those being instructed . " " If that is the case , " Stevenson came back , " what 's the use of the instruction ? If there is no common denominator so far as moral standards are concerned , where does all this lead us ? out of the woods or deeper into them ? Are n't we going to be all over the lot ? " " It may look that way , " Iverson admitted , " but I believe the picture will come together more clearly in a bit . I 'll ask your indulgence , Sarah , and perhaps some of the rest of you , to put a couple building blocks in place before we get to the important question you just posed . " First , I want to emphasize that the training we will be talking about this morning is for managers , not for the rank and file within the company . We shall ? " " Just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm no flaming liberal , but I think that has a bad sound , rather elitist . " " You ca n't be serious , Andy , " Joe Hendricks broke in . " We 're not talking about different drinking fountains for managers and the rest of the organization . Managers may have different needs in ethics training just as they have other requirements that are different . In fact , and I 'm saying this partly to prove to Carl and everyone that I read the advance material , treating managers differently in this respect may be ethically sanctioned . Somewhere I read , maybe in relation to Immanuel Kant and it made a lot of sense to me , that people should be treated differently only if there are differences in circumstances that make this appropriate . And I 'll bet that you are going to tell us that managers have different ethical problems that make this appropriate . Is n't that right , Carl ? " " Maybe , Joe , I 'd better have you conduct the meeting , " Iverson said with a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't expect the person on the assembly line , the computer operator , the payroll clerk to deal with ethical dilemmas that involve complex competing rights in the company . It 's fine if they understand the concepts , but they wo n't have occasion to use them 164 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM roundings to evaluate issues as to what provides the greatest utility to society or as to how Kant 's categorical imperative would apply . " Pausing a moment and looking around , Iverson asked , " Does this make sense ? " " Yes , " Andrew O'Malley said , " it gives academic respectability and categorization to what I guess I knew to be the case all along , except that I would have suspected more people would be in the postconventional stage . Maybe we just do n't like to see ourselves as others see us . But I ca n't see where this gets us . " " I ca n't either , " Stevenson chimed in . " What does it mean to ethics training ? " " Just this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who must deal with complex ethical dilemmas ? managers , in the case of Hauser-Moore ? into the postconventional stage . It is only there that they go beyond group conformity , that they reach decisions on the basis of broad moral principles . That should be the goal of much of any ethics training a company might initiate for its management group . " " Is that a realistic goal ? " Cynthia Downs asked . " If most people never get beyond the conventional stage , is n't it naive to assume that , with a little training , we can move enough people into the postconventional stage at the company to make much difference ? Or am I missing something ? " " If you 're missing something , Cindy , I 'm right along with you , " Hendricks said , shaking his head . " Do you really think you can accomplish that , Carl ? " " Yes , with a couple caveats , " Iverson replied . " Remember , we 'll be teaching ethical analysis , not trying to change people 's moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to an ethical model and then lead them through something like the seven-step approach we discussed earlier this morning , this forces them into postconventional stage thinking . Do you see how this works ? " " While they 're focusing on it , yes , " Downs said thoughtfully , " but will it stick ? " Ethics Can Be Taught / 165 " That 's the $64 question , " Iverson said . " What you 're asking is whether , a few months later , people will remember to apply moral reasoning in solving , even identifying , an ethical dilemma or whether they 'll slip back into their old conventional mode . To be honest , I doubt that any company training program can move a person permanently , for all problems , into the postconventional mode . I do believe , however , that it is feasible for most of their business dilemmas , if properly reinforced ? a matter I want us to discuss a little later . Can we at least accept such an assumption for now ? " Concern about Results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see that using the approach you described could bring people 's ethics reasoning to the postconventional level , at least for most managers , but I 'm back to my earlier problem . Without any commonality as to moral standards , where does this get us ? Would n't people end up spread out over the landscape ? I do n't mean to be flippant about this , Carl , and you , too , George , but are n't we just as well off being all over the lot operating the way we always have as we will be with all this fancy training ? " " Sarah , " Iverson came back , " I 'd be the first to admit we would n't have unanimity . That 's too much to expect when you realize that , despite at least 2,500 years of effort , philosophers have never been able to reach any agreement on ethical models . But the situation is not as bleak as you seem to envision . Ethical analysis will , I am convinced , bring order out of the chaos that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking ? and , as a result , to identification of differences in views within a company , or any group ? which should lead to some kind of agreement on important problems . Quotations do n't prove anything ; however , knowing that this issue would probably come up ? it usually does in meetings of this type ? I brought an article written by a well-known professor of corporate strategy and managerial ethics . In it , lie wrote : 166 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM Why teach ethical analysis in a program on business administration if it provides no single solution to ethical dilemmas ? There are two valid reasons . Ethical analysis may not lead to a single right or just or fair answer to a managerial dilemma , but it does lead to some answers that can be clearly seen to be more right or more just or more fair than other answers .. . Ethical analysis also can lead to an evaluation of subjective moral standards and an examination of their supporting personal criteria . . . . Ethical analysis , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value priorities among the person 's goals , norms , and beliefs , and does reinforce that person 's confidence in his or her moral standards of behavior.5 " And this , I would argue , although I can not prove it , is likely to result in far greater consistency than unstructured decision making based largely on hunch and experience . " Evidence That Training Changes People " What you have just said makes sense , " Hendricks admitted , " but is there any evidence that it works ? I 'll admit I have an innate suspicion of logically developed notions that no one can demonstrate will work . Maybe that 's why I 'm an engineer . " " Fair enough , Joe , " Iverson responded . " I do n't think your attitude is at all unreasonable . As my old grandfather from Missouri used to say , you do n't want to buy a pig in a poke ? something you ca n't see . I have some soft and some hard evidence . " The soft evidence is in my own experience . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching ethics at universities , leading ethics seminars , and working with companies on their ethics programs for quite a few years . Admittedly , this is not objective data that you can touch , taste , and feel , but I know that much of the training catches hold . I 've gone back over the years to several companies and have a feel from their experience that there is a real result . Ethics Can Be Taught / 167 " The hard evidence , though , that may have greater credibility comes from some studies that have been made . I have one here in the form of an article by James R. Rest , a University of Minnesota psychology professor and the research director at its Center for the Study of Ethical Development . The following are among important findings based on his surveys of recent psychological research : " Dramatic and extensive changes occur in young adulthood ( the 20s and 30s ) in the basic problem-solving strategies used by the person in dealing with ethical issues . " " Deliberate educational attempts ( formal curriculum ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning/judgment process can be demonstrated to be effective . " " Studies link moral perception and moral judgment with actual , real-life behavior. " 6 " But does n't that suggest , " O'Malley inquired , " that his research is directed toward education in an academic environment ? Would this necessarily apply to company training ? " " I ca n't speak , of course , for Rest , " Iverson answered , " but I would think that comparability of results would depend on three factors : the education levels of those involved , the quality of instruction , and the depth of instruction . " The population involved in the studies Rest used were presumably college students , probably both graduate and undergraduate . I believe that managers at Hauser-Moore would constitute a similar group ; most of them would have gone to college , and others , I believe , would have backgrounds and experience that would be reasonably comparable . " Quality and depth of instruction are obviously important factors . Certainly an informal training program conducted by persons without adequate exposure to ethical concepts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , we 're not , George , " Iverson responded . " I would n't say that a one-time program is worse than nothing , but it might not be much better . For one thing , you have a continuously changing group that needs the training ? new people from outside , promotions , retirements , all those factors that result in personnel changes at the managerial level . But that is n't the most important reason , not by a long ways . The principal reason is the need for reinforcement . " " What do you mean ? " Cynthia Downs asked . " I suspect I know , but I 'd like to have you explain it . " " Of course , Cindy ? and I intended to , because it 's very important . It is such a truism , maybe so obvious , that I have n't bothered to bring any support , but education in any field , not just ethics , requires use and reinforcement . People forget , they get busy . They lose the enthusiasm that immediately follows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ideas . " This may be particularly true with ethics , " Iverson continued . " Significant ethical dilemmas do n't arise every day for everyone . People lose some of their sensitivity ; they may fail to recognize moral issues when they do come up . They may be under some peer pressure to conform , to go along . They need the reinforcement , the new ideas , and the renewed interest that come from continuing training . " This happens even in school . Cynicism takes over unless something is done to counter it . I was rather depressed to read the experience of one professor who attempted to introduce ethical concepts into his courses , only to find that his efforts were being undermined . A teacher of some advanced classes once told him ? and let me read this : Some of my students come in talking about ethics and social responsibility . I can tell they took your classes . It takes me three or four weeks to convince them that none of that stuff matters.8 Ethics Can Be Taught / 171 " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you and I well know that the same pressure exists , but more so , in many business environments . We need reinforcement , continual training to counter it . " " Do you mean repeating the program periodically , say annually ? " O'Malley asked . " No , " Iverson replied . " That would be rather ineffective . People would say , Here we go again . ' It would become old hat , you know . I do n't want to get into details today ? indeed I could n't if I wished ? but the timing and content for a company would depend on a number of factors ? number of people involved , turnover , experiences within the company . A program should be tailor-made to fit the situation . The follow-up training , the reinforcement , should consider the makeup of the participants and should build on what has gone before . " " Carl , " Hauser said , " I can see that it is time for lunch . Is this a good stopping point ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that my notes suggest in the area of training ? not the details of how it should be conducted but whether it is worthwhile , accomplishes anything . During lunch I can answer any questions you or others may have on that or anything else we talked about this morning . Then , if we have addressed all that satisfactorily , we can get into the elements of a company ethics program right after lunch . " The committee members had enjoyed a lively discussion over lunch , exploring some of the nuances of matters discussed during the morning . Iverson was particularly interested in noting the increasingly active role that Joe Hendricks was playing in the giveand-take , since Hauser had regarded Hendricks 's participation and support as one of the keys to a successful program implementation . Now had come the time to get into the elements of an effective corporate program . But first , Iverson wanted to lay some groundwork . Individual Ethics within the Corporate Environment " There are knowledgeable critics , " he said , " who believe that addressing ethics as an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim , have little choice but to operate within the constraints of their environment . As a respected management professor has put it ? sorry , give me a second to find the quotation I want in these papers ? OK , here it is : The problem is that ethics in management represents a conflict between the economic and the social performance of an orComponents of a Program / 173 ganization , and if that conflict is not specifically addressed and resolved by the senior executives within the firm , the natural tendency of the middle-level and operating-level managers will be to favor the economic side of the balance . Why ? Because under current managerial systems , their performance is measured by economic criteria and their future is dependent upon economic results . ' " Do you agree with that analysis ? " " I have no question on that score , " answered Cynthia Downs . " It is only a matter of degree . Some people , of course , will rationalize the subordination of their ethical concerns without much of a struggle , while others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general proposition , I agree with what he says . " Andrew O'Malley broke in , " I agree ? and possibly more strongly . This is something I was going to bring up . In reading the material that you sent us , I was struck , and disturbed , by the article , Ethical Business and the Ethical Person . ' You know the one I mean ? " Looking around and seeing several nods , he continued , " The authors of that article put it much stronger , Carl , than the quotation you just read . It seems to me that they are saying that ethics has to start at the corporate level , possibly even at the societal level . It almost suggests that we ca n't have business ethics unless we change the basic way in which business is conducted . Although I know all of you saw that article , I want to read a paragraph or two that I highlighted : Studies have consistently shown that individuals with strong moral and ethical values are not predictors of their ethical and moral behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of behavior is more determined by:The climate ( environment ) of the organization ; The role of " significant others , " such as executives , superiors , and peers ; I 69. 174 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM The existence of slack ( or the lack of it ) in productive resources ; The culture of the firm relative to its " social " linkages ; and The intellectual underpinnings of the business system . The overwhelming weight of empirical literature discounts the individual as the determining element of a positive corporate ethical environment . The elements of business principles and executive behavior are far more critical than the " moral context " of the individual conscience . Therefore , ethical direction is in effect provided by the corporation ? since the script is written in policies , directions , codes , decisions , and structures , and the players are guided by the script . Their behavior will use the script as a substitute for their conscience.2 " Andy , that 's nothing but a copout , " Hendricks exclaimed with some heat . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that criminals are n't responsible for their own acts , that they are unfortunate individuals who were abused as children , suffered from poverty , and so on . I 'll admit that it may be hard sometimes , but people have to take responsibility for what they do , not pass the buck to someone else . Do n't you agree , Sarah ? " " Yes , Joe , but only up to a point . I read that same article with considerable interest and got a bit sore , wanting to argue with the authors in a few places . And I think they may have overdrawn their conclusions . But there is no question that a lot of people tend to park their consciences in the coatroom when they arrive at work . That 's wrong ? and I agree with you there , Joe , that they should n't ? but it 's the real world . " " It sure is , " Cynthia Downs spoke up . " I was reminded while reading the article of an experience when I worked in public accounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many respects ? someone told us he spent many of his evenings working on church or charitable organizations , and I Components of a Program / 175 would have had no hesitancy in trusting him to handle any money I might have . " But when it came to company matters , I have never met anyone who could scramble so hard to produce the earnings that the CEO wanted . He would come up with convoluted rationalizations and even withhold documents . We used to wonder how he could reconcile his business behavior with his personal values . He may be an extreme , but I have seen enough examples to know that some people are able to build up a wall between their personal ethics and what they think is required of them in business ? and not seem to suffer from any twinges of conscience . " Apparently , " she continued , " some companies expect this of their employees , an unquestioning willingness to work for any company objective as long as it is n't illegal , and sometimes without that limitation . In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insensitivity , that the company has never thought to tell the employees that no one expects them to go against their consciences , and the employees feel that they are expected to achieve results , with no questions asked . " " That 's a pretty good summary , Cindy , " Iverson said . " All of you , in different ways , are bringing out just what we need at this stage . Obviously we may have some differences of emphasis , but I believe all of us would agree on two points ? that individual character , ethical awareness , is essential , but that corporations must be ethically sensitive and provide an environment in which the individual is comfortable following his or her conscience . That is what I wanted to have everyone recognize before getting into what should go into a company ethics program ? that ethics is a corporate as well as an individual problem and that a responsible management must face up to its responsibility for the workplace environment . " You recognize , I 'm sure , that we 're not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no such thing as a standard program ; each of the components must be tailored to fit a company 's operations , and its philosophy and traditions . Some parts take a lot of time and effort to develop ; 176 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM the whole program probably ca n't be implemented all at once . What we are going to do now is to consider the nature of the items that go into a program ? the components . After that , George and the rest of you will have to assign responsibilities for developing the various parts and establish a timetable . " With that , Iverson stepped over to the flip chart at the end of the room and turned over the top page , showing the following listing : " Here , " he pointed , " are the areas I hope we can cover this afternoon . You will note that I have split these into two main parts , one the creation of the ethical environment and the other the implementation of the program . This split is somewhat arbitrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is some overlap . But I think that looking at the program in this way is useful ; the first three elements , which we might consider a foundation , should underlie the design of an ongoing program . " Statement of Values Referring to the flip chart , Iverson said they would now talk about a corporate statement of values . He inquired whether this meant anything to anyone . The committee members looked uncertainly Components of a Program / 177 at one another , so Iverson continued , " None of you has asked why Hauser-Moore wants to have an ethics program . In your case , this is , perhaps , not surprising . Probably before , but certainly since being appointed to this committee and having had a chance to go through the advance reading material , you had a good idea what ethics is about . And George 's introductory comments helped bring this into sharper focus so far as Hauser-Moore is concerned . " Everyone , though , does n't have that perspective . And if the people in an organization have little or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are likely to look at it from a mechanical viewpoint . They need to be told , and to be reminded again and again , why ethics is important to their company . " A good statement of values , " Iverson continued , " which is sometimes referred to as a mission statement or a credo , should be the cornerstone of a company 's ethics program . It tells the organization , and the world , what the company stands for . It is positive , dealing with goals ? obligations to employees , to customers , to suppliers , to the community . You might call it a compass . " " Maybe I 'm alone in this , " Cynthia Downs spoke up , " but I have a little difficulty visualizing what a credo or whatever you call it really looks like . . . and what a company does with it once one is prepared . " " Fair enough , Cindy ; I 'll try to be more specific . A company can , probably usually does , have diverse reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be strictly altruistic , a belief that being ethical is the right thing to do ? a desire to be a good corporate citizen . Another reason may be a belief that good ethics is good business , that a company with a reputation for being ethical is perceived as a better employer and a more dependable supplier of goods or services . For some companies , a persuasive argument is that a good ethics program will help them avoid those problems that have plunged too many companies into serious legal problems and damaging publicity . All of these reasons , and probably some others I have n't thought to mention , are valid and legitimate . In my view , though , a company 's statement of values 178 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM should focus on the first reason I mentioned ? that being ethical is the right way to behave . Period . " " Why ? " O'Malley asked . " Should n't we try to sell ' the pro-gram ? " " Yes , Andy , " Iverson responded , " but not here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement to the employees , to suppliers , to customers , and to the public generally . I believe that it should take the high road , and that is certainly appropriate for Hauser-Moore . If the statement is drafted to suggest self-interest , that the company is being ethical to gain an advantage , it is less likely to serve its purpose with those who read it . It could even make the effort appear somewhat cynical . " " But , Carl , you still have n't quite told me what the statement should look like , " Downs persisted . " You wo n't let me get away with generalities , " Iverson laughed . " I believe that a good statement should be brief , focusing attention on what is really important ? the organization 's shared values . It should not be detailed or defensive ; for that reason , I do n't believe it should be written by the legal department . Certainly not by public relations people . To be sincere , credible , it should have support at the top , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , of the rank and file . George , from our discussions , I think you could give everyone a good idea what Hauser-Moore 's credo should say , maybe not in a polished form but in substance . Would you mind giving us your thoughts ? " " I 'd like to , " Hauser answered . " This is something I have given quite a bit of thought to recently , and I 'll try to put it concisely . In my view , Hauser-Moore 's statement of values should say that it recognizes that its business is inextricably tied to the public interest and that its business decisions should never be made solely in the financial interest of the company . It could enlarge on this by saying that all decisions should give due weight to the interests of all its constituents ? its shareholders , its employees , its suppliers , its customers , the community in which it operates , and the public at large . " Components of a Program / 179 " That , I think , is a good , strong start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " Downs said , " I have one . The statement sounds fine , but how and where will it be used ? " " It should be discussed periodically in meetings at all levels of the company , " Iverson replied . " It should be a key part of the company 's training program . Above all , it is n't something to be put in a drawer , or just to pin up on the wall . It sort of caps the role of company culture and management tone ? matters we 're about to discuss . It summarizes these and reminds people of where they should be headed . " I suspect Hauser-Moore 's wrestling with the relocation problem would have been easier if the board had had a statement of values . The members might have focused sooner on whatever obligations it believes it has to employees , suppliers , and the community . Not that I have any reason to believe the answer would have been different , but it would have been handled less traumatically . And the various stakeholders might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " Iverson continued , " it 's time to turn to the next element , corporate tradition ? a more formal way , perhaps , of characterizing a company 's personality . Because a company does have a personality to be recognized , dealt with , perhaps nurtured ? " " Excuse me , Carl , " Sarah Stevenson broke in , " perhaps I ought to wait ? maybe you 'll clarify this ? but did n't you say this morning that , while a corporation is legally a person , it is not a human being ? Can it have a personality ? " " A good question , Sarah , and I 'll try to answer it . A company does n't think ; it does n't have emotions . It is created by human beings for a specific function , to conduct a business . Anything it does , for good or bad , reflects decisions and actions of those people who own and manage it . " But that does n't mean , " Iverson continued , " that it does n't have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of 180 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM values , responses , ways of identifying itself that are distinctive , that set it apart from other business entities . You surely have noted that with companies or institutions you deal with ? a subconscious , perhaps , but clearly recognizable way of conducting themselves . To go outside business , for illustration , think of the Marine Corps ... its esprit de corps . For better or for worse , every entity has this ? let 's call it tradition ' or ' culture ' ? that begins developing from the first day of its existence . " " OK , but what does tradition have to do with the installation of an ethics program ? I guess I sense a relationship , but you ca n't create a tradition overnight , " observed Andrew O'Malley . " You 're absolutely right , Andy , " Iverson responded , " about creating an instant tradition ? you ca n't . But you must recognize the tradition a company has . It is that on which the ethics program must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The foundation may be weak , may need some shoring up , but it is what underlies whatever you create . " I 'm glad you brought up the point that a tradition can not be created overnight . We 've all seen the absurd , sometimes pathetic attempt of some people to manufacture a family history , maybe using a coat of arms bought from some company that sells them through magazine advertisements . Or buying an old house and covering the walls with paintings of persons that the owner hopes visitors will assume to be distinguished ancestors . " You ca n't buy a tradition , " Iverson continued . " You ca n't retain a consultant to create one . A man who has written lucidly and eloquently on the subject ? I 'd like to give each of you a copy of his book because there 's a lot else in it , but it 's out of print ? has likened the constructing of a corporate tradition to the gradual building , over many years , of a coral reef . Because I think this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has said : We forget both the density and duration of the activity underlying the surface facts with which we deal . We forget that , like an iceberg , nine tenths of their mass lies hidden , well below the normal waterline of vision . And we forget that the Components of a Program / 181 part we can see is not just " there " but is very much something built , something constructed or pieced together over time . Corporations , the institutions of modern commerce , are such constructed things , and the work that managers do takes place in such " built " environments . Phrased so baldly , the point seems obvious . But in the normal course of events ? and , especially , in terms of how we regularly talk and think about the work of management ? the point disappears from view . As a practical matter , we do not commonly treat a corporation as the cumulative result of an historical process of development , nor do we think of it in the present as an edifice held together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , and we should.s Elsewhere he says : Institutions do remember all the time . The style of a business presentation , the kinds of evidence that tend to sway decisions , the shared sense of what constitutes relevant information about a new market or product , the deep-seated visceral preference for certain lines of business ? all these characteristics , and a thousand others like them are the subtle products of memory . In no two organizations are they exactly the same , nor in any two parts of the same organization . . . ' " Does n't that tell us something important ? obvious , once focused on , but often overlooked ? " Iverson asked . " We never write on a completely clean slate ; everything we do , everything we think , builds on our experience ? on our persona , which reflects our history . It is the same with a corporation . We have to recognize this when we undertake something new . " And , " he continued , " besides the fact that whatever program you develop for Hauser-Moore must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear in mind ? that this program , like everything else that goes on at the company each day , is a part of the ongoing building of Hauser-Moore 's tradition . We are not . 182 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM just bound by a static tradition ; we are participants in the creation of an ongoing culture . " " But , Carl , you seem to assume that Hauser-Moore not only has a tradition but that it is a good one on which to build , " Stevenson said . " Fortunately , I believe that is true . Are you telling us , though , that a company with a lousy tradition , and there certainly are such , ca n't initiate an ethics program ? " " No , Sarah , " Iverson replied , " but they 'll have a lot tougher time . They can only build on what is there , but without a good foundation they 'll have to start rebuilding one , trying to save what is good , getting rid of the bad , and bonding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into any tradition , good or bad , changing it is a tough job . And the people involved will need to pay a lot more attention to reinforcements , some of the other features we 'll be talking about . " Looking at Hauser-Moore , I ca n't claim to have a real sense of its tradition , certainly not in any depth . But I do sense that it exists and is positive . I would only suggest that you take concrete steps to nurture it . It may even be , George , that it mainly reflects your father 's and your attitudes . Nothing wrong with that , but it means that you have to broaden the base . You must be as concerned with the ethical qualities of your management as you are with their technical competence . Tradition is fragile : It takes years to build , but it can be destroyed overnight . Protect it . " Do n't , though , make of it more than it is , " Iverson went on . " Do n't put it up on a pedestal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and risk making it the butt of jokes among the employees . But , in every way you can , including some matters we 'll discuss later , reinforce it and make it implicit in everything Hauser-Moore does , a part of the company 's accepted culture . " Importance of Tone at the Top Turning back to the flip chart , Iverson said , " Now let 's talk about tone at the top . Does everyone understand what I mean by that ? " " Is n't it pretty much the same as tradition ? " I lendricks asked . Components of a Program / 183 " Let me try , " Downs broke in . " Is n't tone at the top just a part of tradition ? not the whole thing but just the attitude of top management ? " " Right , Cindy , " Iverson responded . " Tradition is the buildup of company culture over the years , admittedly mainly from the top . What I refer to as tone at the top means the attitude of , the flavor imparted by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company 's tradition , one way or the other , but at any given time it may even run counter to tradition . We have all heard of companies with fine traditions that slip , operationally and ethically . " As much as , maybe even more than , tradition , the tone of top management influences a company 's ethical behavior . Let me be specific . If the officers begin abusing their position , treating company property like their own , this attitude trickles down throughout the organization . Employees ask themselves why they should n't fiddle a little with their expense accounts when they see excesses higher up . " " Surely you do n't mean , Carl , that rank does n't have its privileges , to use an old military saying , " Hendricks asked . " Surely George is entitled to charge things that a new employee ca n't ? first-class travel , for example . Let 's not carry this egalitarian attitude too far . " " That 's not what I meant , but it 's good that you brought it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly appropriate at different levels within a company as long as they relate to company business . What sends the wrong signals is a perception that top executives take advantage of the situation ? manufacturing reasons for using the company airplane for personal trips , having the use of company-owned apartments in resort areas , decorating their homes with company property , and so forth . Accepting expensive gifts from those the company does business with is another example . Sure , what they do offers no legitimate excuse for corner-cutting by employees ; human nature being what it is , though , lax attitudes at the top encourage chiseling at the bottom . " 184 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM " Is n't there more to tone at the top than management 's not taking personal advantage of the situation ? " Hauser asked . " Yes , George , there is , and I may have started at the wrong end , " Iverson replied . " It 's a matter of management 's showing by its actions what it really thinks is important ? the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action seems to be contrary to the company 's economic interests , at least in the short term . " A company has , say , a top salesperson . There have been lots of rumors in the company about his or her behavior ? even a suspicion of his or her paying off some purchasing agents . His or her expense reports would choke a cow , but no one speaks up to him or her . Several people have even talked to the sales vice president , but they 've received nothing but a vague brush-off . It does n't take much savvy for the organization to get the message : Ethics is fine if it does n't cost anything , but profits come first . " Or , you have a tough lady in charge of the public relations department . She humiliates employees in front of others . Several have quit , and there have been numerous complaints . But she 's good at her job ? manages to keep the company 's name out of some sticky situations , no one is quite sure how . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show a little more respect for her employees , she laughingly , but publicly , told friends over drinks that she had let him know where he could put the job if he did n't like the way she handled it . In a situation like that , what are employees to think about the employer 's commitment to its employees ? to its respect for them as people ? " I could go on and on , " said Iverson , " but you get the point . Management has to support its ethics program , not just give it lip service . It 's like body language . The way people behave or react shows what is important to them ? the old saying that actions speak louder than words . Management can initiate sound procedures . It can promulgate well-written codes of conduct . It can do everything right ? on paper . And yet , if it is slack itself or lets others get away with things , somehow or other the organization Components of a Program / 185 can see that the matter of ethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Hauser , Iverson continued , " And here we have another good example , somewhat different , of management commitment ? and I mean a good example ? right in front of us . I do n't want to embarrass you , George , but it 's your initiating and then chairing this committee . " Hauser said deprecatingly that it was nothing , that he was interested and had the time . " Sure , George , you made the time , " Iverson shot back . " A story I read the other day will make what I 'm driving at clear . A group of CEOs had met to discuss ethics , and this is the story of a real meeting involving top people . One of them related this experience ; I brought it along because I thought it might be useful : I 'd like to tell you a story about a large , for-profit health insurance company that wanted an ethics program . The chief executive told us that he was trying to send this message out , but that his people were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " memo audit , " to see if he was sending it down the line . Sure enough , buried in the memos were little messages that , unless people read their memos differently than I do , were unclear as to what was actually going on . We told him that he , personally , should tell his people about his ethics program . I suggested he make a video . He looked me square in the eye , and said , " You mean sit in plastic chairs and drink coffee out of styrofoam cups with all those people ? " Laughter This is an extreme case , but it illustrates part of the problem.5 " It sure does , " Hauser said . " But you need n't worry about me with the styrofoam cup . " " I know , George . But what about the plastic chair ? " Iverson responded amid chuckles around the table . " But that 's what I wanted to get across . You started this program . You 're chairing it . It has your active , visible support , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sure you 'll attend ? and you should . 66. 186 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM It 's hard to convince an organization that something the boss does n't have time for is really important . If he or she does n't take part , it sends a message to the people in the next level , and they may decide they 're too busy . . . and on and on , throughout the organization . " Still another way for top management to set the right tone is by establishing realistic goals . You want to challenge your people , but be reasonable . I 've seen situations , as I 'm sure you have , or at least read about , where management set such high production quotas that the organization could n't meet them without cutting corners . And when the chickens came home to roost , management claimed it could n't understand what went wrong . Or setting extremely high earnings goals , and possibly releasing these to the public , is an invitation to creative accounting . Management should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To sum up in a few simple words , a company ethics program is only as good as the visible commitment from the top . " " Carl , " Joe asked , starting to rise from his chair , " can we have a 10-minute break ? I 'm sure I 'll focus better on what 's coming if I can stretch my legs ? and maybe get a styrofoam cup of coffee . " Everyone laughed , and made for the door . Code of Conduct Fifteen minutes later ( no one has ever seen a real 10-minute break ) , all the members were back in their chairs . " Now , " Iverson said , " let 's turn to what 's involved in a company code of conduct . During the break , Joe noted that this was the next topic on the flip chart and asked me if this is the set of Boy Scout rules some companies pin up over the water cooler . " Hearing some chuckles , Iverson smiled , " I can see that that amuses you , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterization fits for some companies . Too often , they are rather detailed lists of things to be done ? or things not to be done . And it is sometimes a mixed hag ; for exComponents of a Program / 187 ample , it may include such things as a dress code ... not very stirring , I 'm afraid . " Also , many of the codes tend to be too self focused . A widely quoted 1983 study of 119 codes seemed , as the authors put it , to reflect a more abiding concern for conduct that is directly inimical to a firm 's internal operations for example , a heavy emphasis on conflicts of interest than for relations in keeping with its responsibility to the society of which the corporation is a part . ' 6 " Sometimes a code emerges as a response to legal or ethical problems that a company or an industry has found itself in . There is nothing wrong with this , but as a result cynics tend to dismiss the effort as PR . It may be written , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to make it rather sterile . " " I gather , " said Stevenson , " that you are not an enthusiastic proponent of codes of conduct . " " I do n't want you to jump to that conclusion , Sarah . I 've given you the downside first , partly to show how a code can go wrong . If used in the right way , it can , and in many companies does , serve a very useful purpose . It reinforces the statement of values with specifics . It can , indeed should , be incorporated into ethics training . It can remind people of pitfalls . A code can provide a road map for designing compliance reviews , a matter I intend to address shortly . " The important thing is that the code must be used . It must be a vital , living document . The company 's employees must be aware of its existence and its significance . Although one survey found that half of the respondents ' companies had written codes of ethics , about four out of ten said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the context of their work ' ? certainly a disturbing commentary , both on the companies ' real interest in the subject and in the emphasis they place on their codes . 188 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM Some companies , I know , require employees , at least above a certain level , to sign that they have read the codes ? each year , say ? which is good if it is not handled in too casual or too perfunctory a way . " Iverson continued , " As someone remarked in a recent discussion , a sure indication of the effectiveness of a code is how often it is revised . Procedures change . So does the business environment . New problems emerge . If a code is to have an impact , it must be kept up-to-date . " Established Procedures " But let 's move a step down , " Iverson went on . " Important as codes of conduct may be , they are of limited value if left at that point . They are too general . A company must get specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expected . You 'd be surprised how useful well-documented policies and procedures are in facilitating ethical behavior . They provide guidelines for behavior ? for example , to help a supervisor know how to handle an employee who seems to be taking advantage of the company 's sick leave benefits . Or how to select suppliers . " Another point ? good procedures , and what you accountants , Cindy , call internal control , remove temptation . They help keep people honest . We 've focused our whole discussion thus far on the assumption that people are inherently honest , that they want to do the right thing , that all that may be hindering them is a lack of understanding or pressure from someone else ? usually someone above them . But there are dishonest individuals , amoral people , in this world , and a company would be foolhardy not to take reasonable precautions against them . Some years back , George Santayana , the noted American philosopher , wrote : Undoubtedly , there is little integration or integrity in most men 's character ; there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and if social pressure were not added to lack Components of a Program / 189 of opportunity disorderly lives would be more common than they are.8 " I hope that he 's overly cynical , " O'Malley interjected , " but I ca n't help relating it to something I read in the paper the other day . In a British public opinion survey , more than half of those questioned , as I recall , said they would cheat the government out of $80,000 of taxes if they could be sure of not being caught . And 11 percent of men and 3 percent of women even said they would commit murder to become millionaires if they were assured of getting away with it . " 9 " That 's horrible . What a depressing view of human nature ! " Downs exclaimed . " Is n't it , though ? I want to believe , " Iverson said , " that fewer would do these things if facing an actual situation . But it is illustrative of the point I 'm trying to make ? that a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at bay . As someone once said , we lock desk drawers to keep honest people out . " But equally important , good procedures , strictly enforced , carry a message of what is expected . They set an important tone . An example involves the policies of what expenses can be charged to the company , how they should be supported , and who approves expense reports . We 're dealing here with people 's money , and it is very important to be sure that everyone is treated fairly and consistently , from top to bottom . I read somewhere that you can judge the strength of a company 's commitment to sound internal controls by looking at its expense reimbursement policies . That may be a bit of an exaggeration , but there 's a message there . You should try to sell the organization on ethics , train them well , but then you should establish fair , clear policies that do n't invite , that even prevent , shortcuts . 190 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM " And let 's not forget procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start preaching , but good reinforcement is important . The most important element , one we 'll turn to next , is continuing training . Some companies have managers , at least , sign an annual statement that they have reread and are familiar with the company 's code of conduct and have abided by its provisions during the last year . And that they do not have any conflicts of interest . I know that some people think that such signed statements become routine , boilerplate , and that people sign them without much thought . Some of that may be true , but a lot depends on whether the requirement is presented properly ? and whether there is prompt follow-up in case signed statements are not returned . It 's a matter of doing your best . " A few minutes of questions and some observations followed ; then Iverson said they would turn quite briefly to training . Training in Ethical Reasoning " Having spent a good part of the morning on whether ethics can be taught , I do not plan to take much of your time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . We would all agree , I imagine , that training can be effective and that it is important ; the only questions concern how much and when . These are matters that we shall have to deal with in far more detail at another time , but I 'd like to cover a few high spots now . " You 'll have to decide who should be trained ? what levels of management to include . The general nature of the training . How often it will take place . Who will develop the material , and who will conduct the training . All very important issues . " " Generally , how often should training sessions be held ? " Downs asked . " Not too often , I hope , " Hendricks broke in . " Seriously , I am more taken with this whole idea about ethics than I would have expected , so I do n't want to sound negative . On the other hand , this is a business ; remember , we have other training around Components of a Program / 191 here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not running an educational institution rather than working . " " You 're right , Joe , " Iverson said . " You must n't overdo it . But I doubt if that will be a problem ; you 'll probably find that there 's more you want to cover than you can get prepared and scheduled . Let 's just leave it in generalities at this stage . It does no good to make a big splash at the outset and then drift off into nothing . Memories are short . People come and go . People need to be sensitized frequently . And learning needs reinforcement . Shorter , but more frequent sessions are the answer . " " What do you include in training ? " O'Malley asked . " How do you keep people interested ? We 've enjoyed the informal discussion with you in a small group , but would n't an ethics lecture get boring ? " " Absolutely , " Iverson replied . " Another reason to keep sessions short . . . not to lecture . To have good leaders , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on case studies , sometimes written and sometimes in the form of video vignettes ; there are quite a few available . And there should be a lot of student participation . " But now , let 's take a short break ? I see Joe looking at his watch ? and try to get back promptly for the rest of the program discussion . We 're behind , which is OK ? I certainly do n't want to run through this too fast ? but I know all of you have tight schedules . " Inquiries and Whistle Blowing " What 's this hot line business that 's next on the chart , Carl ? " Stevenson asked when all the members had resumed their seats . " I know you 'll get into it , but I 've been puzzled each time I looked at your flip chart . " " I 'm sorry , Sarah . I had n't meant for it to be distracting . It - nay not be the best caption , but I wanted to be sure we would n't skip over an important concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd do if you saw someone iii the company ? a fellow worker , 192 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM say , or even a boss ? doing something unethical ? Maybe not monumental but clearly wrong . Harmful to the company , let 's assume . " " I 'd tell my boss , " Downs said . " But Cindy , maybe it is n't even in your department , " Stevenson said , shaking her head . " That 's not the issue , " Hendricks interjected . " Give your boss the problem to handle . Do n't go sticking your nose into other departments . " " I do n't think I agree , " Stevenson said , " but let 's change the scenario a bit . What if the one who is doing something you think is wrong is your boss ? Maybe he or she has even asked you to do something that you consider unethical ? " " I 'd still start with the person I report to , " Hendricks said firmly . " Even more so . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face , not to go around his or her back . " " But , " O'Malley asked , " what if you do and the boss says forget it ? " " Good question , but let 's stop here , " Iverson said with a smile . " You 've done a very good job of identifying the problem ? a common problem . And one there is no good universal answer for . One of the toughest things in any company is setting up a procedure for employees to follow when they have an ethics question , or see something they think is an ethics problem . It 's tempting to take a pass on it , to say that it 's the individual 's problem to work out , but that 's a nonanswer . You ca n't solve the problem , perhaps , but you owe it to the organization to give it a try . For lack of a better name on the chart , I referred to the process as a hot line . ' " " What about a place or number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Does n't that get the question out in the open but still protect the person raising the question ? " " You ca n't be serious , Cindy , " Stevenson said with a grimace . " You 'd be inviting poison pen letters . How distasteful ! " " That is a problem , " Iverson agreed . " Many companies would not want to open up something like t his ? too much like Components of a Program / 193 big brother . ' There 'd be calls like Did you know Joe Doaks had his secretary out to dinner last night ? Did n't get home until 3:00 a.m . ' I think it opens up a lot of possibilities for an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust . Besides , there 's no way to follow up if more information is needed on whatever the allegations may be . " " Carl , " O'Malley inquired , " do n't some companies have an ombudsman for matters like this ? Would n't that be a good so-lution ? " " What is that ? " Hendricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression , but I ca n't quite put my finger on it . " " Someone in a company , " Iverson said , " who fields difficult questions or complaints that the person originating them does n't feel like taking up with a boss or someone else in responsibility . In theory , the ombudsman ? a Swedish term , incidentally ? is a neutral person who can respond to or take action on a complaint without compromising the person who made it . The ideal ombudsman is a senior person , perhaps nearing retirement , who has the respect of everyone in the company ? sound judgment and access to anyone in the company that he or she needs to talk to . Someone who respects confidences . Someone who has no direct interest in the outcome . And someone who would take the job seriously . " It 's not quite that simple , though , in practice . First , finding the right person could be difficult . But that may not be the biggest problem . How does one protect the source ? Often the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly know anything about . . . or , perhaps , just a few people . Unless the problem is clear on its face , how can the ombudsman follow through without identifying the source ? Is n't the accused entitled to face his or her accuser ? See what I mean ? " " Even if the ombudsman could n't avoid identification of the source , could n't he or she see that the person who raised the issue is not penalized ? " Stevenson asked . Hendricks broke in , " That 's fine in theory , Sarah , and it might work to a degree , but retaliation can be subtle ? ostracizing the informer , finding little things wrong , shading a performance rat196 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM gram to review compliance with these procedures on a periodic basis , much along the lines of what the internal auditors do in the financial area . " " Who would conduct such reviews ? " Hauser asked . " The program can be administered in a number of ways , George , " Iverson replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internal audit department since it has the structure , and the discipline to manage such a program . " " You do n't mean , Carl , that we would have a bunch of auditors running around trying to check up in areas outside their competence , do you ? " Hendricks asked . " Do n't take me wrong , Cindy ? your people are good in their own field , but I do n't want a bunch of bean counters checking up on our manufacturing processes any more than you 'd want engineers second-guessing the way the books are kept . They would n't even know what they were looking at . " " Do n't get worried on that score , " Iverson said . " I 'm talking about the coordination and administration , and it does n't have to be in the internal audit department ? that 's just one suggestion . The actual reviews would be conducted by persons knowledgeable in the areas being reviewed , but not persons reporting to the managers responsible for the areas . A good example , come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly in a number of professions . Reviewers follow a structured process in evaluating the compliance of those being reviewed with the established standards of their profession and , where applicable , their firms . " And let us by no means overlook the importance of doing something , promptly and firmly , about any violations that are discovered . Nothing sends a bad signal to people faster than unenforced policies and codes . Action should be fair and evenhanded ? but timely . " I do n't think , though , that we should take time on more details at this point . It 's the concept I want to get across now ; the particulars can be worked out as the program is developed . We Components of a Program / 197 must never forget , though , that ongoing oversight is an essential ingredient in any effective ethics program . " The way in which the various steps , not just compliance reviews but all of oversight , can be accomplished , " Iverson continued , " may vary from company to company . Familiar as I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a sufficient sense of the company 's dynamics to make specific suggestions ? although I shall be glad to counsel with you and act as a sounding board . Just to get the ball rolling , I shall touch on the important features of the approach adopted by one company that I have worked closely with over several years.The audit committee of the board of directors has the oversight role.A committee of management people , headed by a senior officer , meets regularly to review developments and recommend changes in the program or in the company 's policies and procedures where ethical issues are involved.A formal compliance review program is under the supervision of the internal audit department , with the reviews conducted by senior persons who are knowledgeable about the operations of the department being reviewed.Any violation is reported by the internal audit department to the supervisor of the individual involved , with a request that the supervisor notify the internal audit department within a specified period of the action taken . The results are included in periodic reports to the audit committee of the board of directors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with some idea about how continuing oversight can be maintained . " After a short discussion , Iverson turned to Hauser , " I do n't know , George , what you want to do now . I 've taken more time on this part than I had expected , but I think it 's all been worthwhile . It 's 5:15 now , and I do n't think we 'll get through the next part , which I call Is Business Ethics Worthwhile ? ' before dinner . Besides I think everyone is sat out ' for now . I have two sugges198 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM tions ? either cover the good business ' aspects another time , or discuss them over dinner . Dinner , I know , was to be a social occasion , but that part of the discussion is not particularly heavy and does n't require charts or reading material . It 's up to you . " Hauser discussed the matter briefly with the committee members and then concluded that it would be best to continue over dinner if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron was hot , he said ? also , it might be hard to get the group together soon , especially for just an hour 's discussion . With that , they broke , to reconvene at 6:30 at Hauser 's downtown club where he had a private room reserved for dinner . CHAPTER NINE Is Business Ethics Worthwhile ? Before and during dinner , there was considerable discussion of the day 's sessions , including a number of questions of Carl Iverson . In some cases , he was able to clarify or expand on issues by referring , without disclosing names , to situations that had come up in his teaching and consulting . As the table was being cleared after the main course , George Hauser announced that he wanted to take a few minutes , while everyone was together , to outline how he could see the program going after tonight . " As I see it , we 're committed to having an ethics program at Hauser-Moore , and , after today , I have a general idea what it will include . It might ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hendricks spoke up , " and I may sound a bit presumptuous . Please do n't take this as negative ? I think we 'll probably end up there , and should ? but are n't we putting the cart before the horse ? Do n't we have to decide tonight whether business ethics is worthwhile ? Or are we to take that for granted , with Carl 's comments tonight more or less a benediction on the effort ? " " You 're right , Joe , and never hesitate to catch me up . I guess I have taken the answer for granted . Like the rest of you , I very much want to hear what Carl says tonight , and I 'll admit that it 200 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM could change things . I just did n't want to finish tonight and have everyone leave with a good feeling but without knowing where we 'd go from here . I know Andy and his wife have to visit her mother at the hospital tonight , and I did n't want to tie people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way . Assuming we all feel , after the next hour , that we should go forward , I 'll discuss details with Carl and then get to each of you with a piece of the program that I want you to handle or oversee during the next six weeks . Then I 'll set a date six weeks or a couple months from now for another allday meeting at which we 'll review together what has been done and make decisions as to implementation . OK ? " Seeing indications of general agreement and noting that coffee and dessert were now on the table , Hauser turned to Iverson and suggested they turn to the subject of whether business ethics is worthwhile . " Thanks , George , " Iverson replied . " This will be relatively short but should be one of the most interesting parts of the discussion . Unless , " he said smiling , " everyone is so crammed full of ethics for the day as to have lost their appetites . I wo n't risk asking that question . But there are two questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider during the next hour:What do we mean by " worthwhile " ? And worthwhile for whom ? Meaning of " Worthwhile " Turning to Cynthia Downs , Iverson asked , " Cindy , what do you think we should mean by worthwhile ' in relation to business eth-ics ? " " I guess , does it pay ? " " I was hoping you 'd say that , " said Iverson with a smile . " Not because I agree , but to get the issue out on the table . I read somewhere , I ca n't remember where , that someone said what we need are some studies to tell us whether business ethics pays . I disagree , and strongly , on at least two grounds . Is Business Ethics Worthwhile ? / 201 " First , I question whether such a study is possible , and how credible the results would be if one were made . I 'm certainly not denying that ethics can affect profitability , one way or the other , but I do n't know how you 'd measure this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important of which is competence . All the good ethics in the world wo n't make a poorly conceived and managed company profitable . A person who might have insisted on continuing the manufacture of buggy whips after the automobile came in could have been the most ethical person in the world , but that would n't have kept the company from going broke . " Conversely , much as I hate to admit it , " Iverson continued , " unethical people , people with the morals of alley cats , sometimes do seem to hit paydirt . We 've all seen that ? to our irritation and frustration . We hope their sins will overtake them , but sometimes they seem to continue prospering . Then , perhaps , we say to ourselves , Probably they are n't enjoying themselves . ' But as we watch them smilingly sail out on their yachts with handsome men and beautiful women all over the decks , we are n't sure . Our final resort is to hope that they 'll at least get their comeuppance in the next world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " No , Cindy , I 'm afraid we ca n't ? should n't ? sell ethics on the basis that it will pay off . And , speaking personally , I do n't like the idea anyway . It smacks of hucksterism . With the spotlight on ethics today , we see quite a few people trying to get in on the act , and one of their approaches is to sell ethics for what it will do for you , like a cure for baldness . " " But , Carl , " Sarah Stevenson broke in , " I can see what you mean for individuals , but we 're talking about business . The function of business is to make money . I would n't go so far as to advocate being unethical in order to make money , but it seems that it is only being responsible if businesspeople are concerned with whether an ethics program will pay off ... and in the only way business results are measured ? financially . " " But is that the only way business results are measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , but if 202 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM that is the only thing , all that we 've discussed all day is meaningless . For example , if we were to agree that employees are stakeholders and should be considered , say , in a relocation decision , we are n't just looking at the bottom line . As I recall Carl 's summarizing this morning , we might use dollars-and-cents considerations as a reason for taking the interests of employees into account if we had other operations in a community and did n't want to foul our nest there , but the stakeholder concept says we should consider them even if the plant to be closed is the only thing the company has in a town . That may be an unusual situation , and I do n't know if everyone agrees completely with that answer , but we could list a lot of places where the company does what it thinks is right without identifying any monetary payoff . " " I happen to agree , " Iverson said . " looking just at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worthwhile for businesses to be ethical . It appeals to the egoistic view of people 's actions ? that they act only in their self-interest . That , I believe , is a mistake . If people acted only out of their own self-interest , we 'd never have soldiers risking , sometimes giving up , their lives by rescuing a wounded comrade under enemy fire . We 'd never see parents giving up a better home , a new car , vacations , to pay for their children 's education . At a far more mundane level , we 'd never have people leaving tips at the end of a meal if they knew they 'd never be in that restaurant again . " " Carl , I do n't intend to be rude , but you seem to keep slipping off into individual situations when what we 're talking about is business , " Joe Hendricks burst out , almost impatiently . " And what 's more , I think you 're contradicting yourself . You told us this morning that a company is created to conduct a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't like a person , that it does n't have emotions , and that it should n't be responsible for social concerns outside its sphere of operations . How do you reconcile this with an argument that we should n't be concerned with whether there is a payoff in business ethics ? " " A good question , Joe , " Iverson answered . " All this gets rather involved , and it 's easy to generate misunderstanding when Is Business Ethics Worthwhile ? / 203 we discuss it . I 'm glad to have a chance to put it in focus ? at least I hope to . " I do n't believe that it is a company 's responsibility to reform the world . Shareholders do n't invest , I 'm sure , so that directors and managements will feel free to use their money for all kinds of good deeds , even acknowledged good , worthwhile ones like saving baby seals . Companies should stick to their business . In doing that , though , they should behave ethically . They should consider stakeholders ? employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , and , yes , the environment . And to build on the example I just stated , yes , they must consider the baby seals and be willing to spend money to protect them if their operations impact the seals ' survival . At the fringes , Joe , the dividing line may be murky , but a company should consider the rights of those it identifies as stakeholders in the conduct of its business , whether or not there is a dollars-and-cents payoff . OK ? " " That helps , " Joe replied slowly . " I see what you mean , although I 'll want to give it a little more thought . " Worthwhile to Whom ? After a brief pause , Iverson continued , " We 've talked so far in quite general terms , and I think this may lead to some uncertainty . It 's time to look at the second question , worthwhile to whom ? That will be the test of whether what we 've been talking about makes any sense . I think we have to look at four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacities Persons acting as agents for their companies Companies " This enables us to bring our consideration into sharper focus . " First let 's take society ? and we can probably cover it rather quickly . For society , there can be no question . Ethics concerns how people behave toward one another ? respect for others as human beings , respect for their rights . Indeed , society would col204 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM lapse if most people did not behave ethically . What if everyone felt free to lie ? To cheat ? To steal ? If everyone were concerned only with Number One ? There would be chaos . " Trust is essential to human activities . People have to believe in one another . Government , business , all our institutions can operate only on the assumption that most people are moral most of the time . It is only rogue operators , pirates if you will , who can succeed by being unethical ? and only because most people are n't ! They are able to freeload on an essentially moral world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah Stevenson commented thoughtfully , " but knowing that , why should n't I , or any person , take advantage of the situation by behaving unscrupulously ? What 's to stop me from being a freeloader ? " People in Their Personal Capacity " That 's a good question , Sarah , but you 're moving away from whether ethics is good for society to the next area , the impact on people acting as individuals . And that is fine with me if you 're all satisfied that ethics is not only worthwhile , that it is essential , at the societal level . " Pausing to look around , Iverson continued , " You seem satisfied , so let 's address Sarah 's question ? what 's to stop her , or anyone else , from freeloading and taking advantage of the mores of society generally ? Any takers ? " " I guess her conscience , " O'Malley offered . " Most of us have a conscience that keeps us in line , at least most of the time . " " Yes , " Iverson replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being punished . Being scorned by family and friends . There are the notorious freeloaders , few in number but large in visibility , who seem to know how to walk close to the edge , who do n't give a damn what others think . Most of us , though , are n't made that way . " And , " he continued , " I ca n't prove this , but intuitively most of us , I believe , think that bad behavior does n't pay off for most people in the long run . Sure , someone may get a one-time windfall from some unscrupulous act . A few may succeed for longer peIs Business Ethics Worthwhile ? / 205 riods , possibly even permanently . They may have the skill , the cool nerve , to manipulate the system to their own ends . But most people who are generally unethical lose out . They do something illegal and get caught . Or they get a bad reputation . People do n't want to do business with them . Other people look for ways to do them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrating on persons acting in their capacities as individuals . Perhaps someone in business for himself or herself . A Boesky type , let 's say . Or a dominant figure in a company ? someone who runs things pretty much as he or she wishes . Legally such persons may be agents , but they feel few constraints ; they operate as though the activity , whatever it may be , is their private preserve . People as Agents of a Company " Let 's turn to the person ? an officer or employee ? who is acting as an agent for a company . People who think they are constrained by corporate policies and procedures , who regard themselves as acting on behalf of others . They are probably the most torn , under the most moral stress , because they may suffer from ethical schizophrenia ? persons who , rightly or wrongly , may feel it necessary to leave their personal ethics at home when they head for work ... the situation described in the article I read earlier ? that it 's pretty hard to expect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . " This is the area that gives me the greatest problem . It is easy for me , who has nothing at stake , to take the high ground , to say that people must follow the dictates of their conscience . And part of this lies in the fact that it is probably the right answer . If everyone did that , it would be a pretty wonderful world , would n't it ? " But I 'd like to read something that J. Irwin Miller , a wellknown business leader and former president of the National Council of Churches , told a group of future ministers in relating the quandary of a manager who could not get a shipment across 206 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM the Indonesian border without giving the customs clerk a $100-bribe . Caricaturing the response of well-intentioned critics , he said : You can tell him that corporate America is a cruel system indeed , that it must be changed in the interest of equity and justice not only for exploited workers , but as well for trapped middle managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . you are going to dedicate your own ministry to working for political , economic and social change . That may hearten him , but what if he goes on to say , " That 's great , but what do I tell our employee in Jakarta this afternoon ? " ' " Most of us would like to give a morally impeccable answer ? or to duck the issue . And I might not hesitate to tell a rising young star , confronted with a tough ethical problem , to do the right thing . He could probably survive , might even benefit from showing his independence and integrity . But what about a 58-year-old manager , someone who hopes that the declining company that he has been with for 30 years will survive until he is ready to retire ? a man , perhaps , with a daughter in college and a sick wife ? " " Are you trying to tell us , Carl , that ethics is relative ? " O'Malley asked . " Does n't that open the door to all kinds of rationali-zations ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iverson asked , with a somewhat rueful smile . " If so , you 're succeeding . But no , Andy , I would n't say ethics is relative . I would , though , say that ethics is sometimes ambiguous . I would never want it on my conscience that I encouraged someone to do something clearly immoral , possibly illegal ? something that would violate most people 's sense of propriety . Something that a person would never want his or her family to know about ? a pretty good test , incidentally . " We all know , though , that there are gray areas . Or minor violations . I would n't , for example , want to see someone make a Is Business Ethics Worthwhile ? / 207 federal case of it and report a fellow employee whom he or she saw , just once under time pressure , pour a pint of noninflammable solvent down the drain . Or report someone whom you heard make a personal long-distance call on the company telephone . There is a place for whistle blowing , but save it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave this subject here , " Iverson said after a pause . " It 's the area that does n't have a good answer . The best solution is to work for a company that encourages ethical behavior , that does n't put its employees in difficult moral quandaries . And that , I might say , is an excellent lead-in to my next and final point : Is ethical behavior worthwhile for a company ? " Worthwhile for a Company ? " Clarence Walton , widely recognized as the pioneer in the field of business ethics , concluded the introduction to his recent book , The Moral Manager , with this quotation from a report issued by the American Assembly , a prestigious association connected with Columbia University : On the important subject of values , we discern a marked deterioration in traditional values essential to competitiveness . A lack of both individual and institutional leadership has eroded respect for community and nationhood . We conclude that values of integrity , social justice , and moral leadership are not only necessary in themselves , but lead directly to competitive advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are inseparable.2 " I agree with that conclusion , but you will want to know , I am sure , why . A good way , perhaps , to encapsulate it is by reference to a recent article , " Challenging the Egoistic Paradigm , " . 208 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM by Norman E. Bowie.3 Do n't let the title turn you off ; obviously the article was not written , or captioned , for laypeople , but anyone who is willing to make a little effort can follow the logic . Much of it is based on a fairly recent book , Passions Within Reason , by economist Robert Frank.4 Admittedly , it is hard to do justice , in a few words , to the way Bowie and , presumably , Frank develop the thesis , but I 'll try to give you the gist . " Bowie argues ? and demonstrates with some interesting examples ? that people , and I 'd include companies , do not calls reciprocal altruism ' is self-defeating . He goes on ? " " Excuse me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In simple ? I hope not oversimplified ? terms , reciprocal altruism amounts to I 'll scratch your back if you 'll scratch mine . ' Tit for tat . In business , if you , the employees , will give us loyalty , we 'll not close the plant during a downturn in business . The problem is you do n't trust a reciprocal altruist because , when push comes to shove , he or she might renege . What we need is what Bowie and Frank call hard-core altruism . An example : Suppose a firm is having difficulty with employee morale and management believes that taking steps to increase employee morale will lead to greater profits . What steps do they take ? Unless management adopts a strategy that is convincingly altruistic , the employees are likely to treat management overtures cynically and behave accordingly . Any gains in productivity are likely to be suboptimal . Management needs a strategy that represents what Frank calls altruistic commitment . A nolay-off policy during an economic downturn is an example of such a policy . It communicates to the employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does Is Business Ethics Worthwhile ? / 209 not yield greater profits . Such a policy would be adopted because it is right rather than because it leads to greater profits.5 " Do you buy that ? " Hendricks asked skeptically . " Joe , I have a couple problems with it , " Iverson replied . " Up to a point , I think it 's quite persuasive if you can put yourself in the proper frame of mind . But there has to be a limit : No company could make an ironclad , forever no-layoff commitment . If the downturn went long enough , it might push the company into bankruptcy . Even profitable operations might get pulled down . " My other problem is , perhaps , a matter of faith . To operate on the basis of hard-core altruism requires faith , and a person or a company has to be committed before undertaking it . It reminds me ? have any of you ever rappelled ? " " What 's that ? " asked Hauser . " Rappelling is using a hand-held rope fastened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and going over the edge and down backward . I was in survival school in the Air Force , up in the Rockies , and we 'd had a demonstration . The instructor turned to me and said , Lieutenant , why do n't you lead off to show your crew how it 's done ? ' It required me to loop the rope around a stout tree , then wrap it around my body in such a way that holding my end out would permit the rope to pay out , in other words for me to drop . Pulling my end in would stop the descent ? so the instructor said . I had to jump off backward into space , then pull on the rope and hope it would halt my fall . And , oh yes , I forgot to mention ? going down I had to brace my feet against the cliff face to keep from banging into it , leaning back and keeping my body stiff and horizontal to the ground far below . " " Did you do it ? " O'Malley asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken out in front of my crew . And yet I would have given a thousand dollars ? which was quite a bit more than I had in the bank then ? to figure a way out . So I did it , and obviously made it . " 210 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM An Act of Faith " But why do I tell you this ? Because , despite the logic behind it , even a demonstration that it worked for someone else , I had to accept on faith that if I pulled down on the rope it would stop my descent . And that keeping my legs stiff and leaning back would keep me from getting bruised and cut up against the face of the cliff . I think that this hard-core altruism Bowie talks about , or altruistic commitment , is something of the same thing . " " I do n't think I 'd be too comfortable taking the leap of faith , " Stevenson said . " I understand , but just remember that this commitment to employees in the illustration Bowie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , management-worker teams , and worker participation that so many people say we need today . I wo n't pretend to be an expert on what makes Japanese industry so successful , but there seems to be some mutual commitment that we may not have . " And besides , remember that you do n't have to accept all this in order to think that business ethics is worthwhile . It 's just another argument . And what 's to lose ? " " Nothing , probably . But you 'll agree , Carl , that we still have to run a tight ship , . ' o n't you ? " Hendricks asked . " A spirit of goodwill can only go so far . " " Absolutely , " Iverson responded . " As I said earlier , we must n't confuse being ethical and being sentimental . It has long been recognized in the military that outfits whose officers maintain a strict , but fair and consistent , discipline are happier , more efficient , than lax organizations . Respecting the rights of others as human beings has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing , an inefficient employee is not , per se , unethical . " " We seem to be focusing on employees , " O'Malley observed . " What about suppliers , customers , other stakeholders ? " " Andy , " Iverson said , " I think any difference may be only of degree , of closeness . I 'd like to read you something I think is quite relevant , something that Kenneth Andrews , a well-known business Is Business Ethics Worthwhile ? / 211 professor and former editor of the Harvard Business Review , wrote . I believe I quoted something he said before dinner , although I may have forgotten to mention his name then ? anyway here goes : An adequate corporate strategy must include non-economic goals . An economic strategy is the optimal match of a company 's product and market opportunities with its resources and distinctive competence . ( That both are continually changing is of course true . ) But economic strategy is humanized and made attainable by deciding what kind of organization the company will be ? its character , the values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities , and shareholders ... 6 " Indeed , it goes beyond business ; as we have discussed , doing right in business is just one aspect of ethical behavior , not something apart . In commenting on recent developments in the Soviet Union , Edvard Shevardnadze , the foreign minister who broke with Gorbachev over the slow pace of perestroika , wrote that only the policy that is morally right is victorious . ' ' Although this may sound a bit platitudinous , I am convinced that he is right over the long run . " But I know we have to stop now . Before we do , though , I 'd like to emphasize a view I hold strongly ? that good ethics is good business but that that is not the sole , even the primary , reason for behaving ethically . I 'll read something that ethicist W. Michael Hoffman has written that sums it up for me : One thing that the study of ethics has taught us over the past 2,500 years is that being ethical may on occasion require that we place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our own interests . And this implies that the ethical thing to do , the morally right thing to do , may not be in our own self-interest . What happens when the right thing is not the best thing for the business ? 212 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM Although in most cases good ethics may be good business , it should not be advanced as the only or even the main reason for doing business ethically . When the crunch comes , when ethics conflicts with the firm 's interests , any ethics program that has not already faced up to this possibility is doomed to fail because it will undercut the rationale of the program itself . We should promote business ethics , not because good ethics is good business , but because we are morally required to adopt the moral point of view in all our dealings ? and business is no exception . In business , as in all other human endeavors , we must be prepared to pay the costs of ethical behavior.8 " And that , " Iverson said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least for now . " " Thanks , Carl , from all of us , " Hauser said , rising and shaking hands . " This has been great . Give me just a minute , if you will , to talk with the others on the committee . " The committee members stepped out in the hall for a few minutes , then returned . George said with a smile , " Well , Carl , it seems that we all want an ethics program to get started ? and as soon as it can be done right . I 'll be in touch soon to discuss some details , and we 'll be setting a date for an initial implementation meeting in about two months . With that , everyone said goodnight and left , chatting with one another as they went out the door . CHAPTER TEN The Story 's Epilogue Three Months Later George Hauser and Stuart Andretti had finished looking over the luncheon menu and had placed their orders . Hauser asked , " Tell me , Stu , how do you think you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a little time to get over the shock , " Andretti laughed . " When you said that some board representatives wanted to talk to nie last week , I had no idea what was in the wind . It even crossed my mind for a moment to wonder if I 'd done something wrong or was over the hill ? if maybe people wanted to replace me on the board . " After they talked to me , " he continued , " I got the idea why I was asked to take the job . And , of course , I talked it over with you . As an old friend , though , I 'd appreciate your filling me in from your perspective , especially since you had to be the moving force . " " There were , of course , a number of reasons , and I 'll recap them as best I can , " Hauser said . " But first , obviously , we could n't have even given you a thought if it had n't occurred to me that you might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM " What ever gave you that idea ? It had n't crossed my mind . " " Well , Stu , you are six years younger than I am ? and in good health . I know why you stepped up to board chair and turned the day-to-day running of your company over to your son three years ago . You thought he was ready . And you wanted to do it while you could still be available to him for counsel and advice . " You may not remember , though , that you told me about six months ago that it had worked almost too well , that you did n't really have enough to do . And I 've had a feeling you were getting a bit bored ? you 'll never be a full-time golfer . So I put two and two together and thought maybe you 'd be the answer to our prayers . You 've known our family for years , and you 've been a HauserMoore director for 17 years . Most important , we have compatible philosophies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd even consider the job ? was how long you 'd be willing to stay . We sure did n't want a series of interim CEOs , people who would n't start anything new because they would n't be around long enough to see it through . And there 's always a lot of jockeying for position underneath when there is a temporary boss . When you told me that you would be willing to give us up to five years barring something unforeseen , it put that concern to rest . I knew we 'd have enough time to plan properly for the future . Does that answer that question ? " " Very well . And it makes sense , " Stu agreed . " But I 'm still surprised you moved so quickly . I thought you 'd hold on to the job for a little longer . After all , you were not just another interim CEO . " " But I was , " Hauser insisted . " Everyone knew my stay would be quite limited this time . We 're still suffering from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departure . Something had to be done to restore some stability , some sense of continuity . I have been able to tide things over temporarily , but everyone knows it 's just that ? my age and my heart condition ... and Jessica 's insistence that I take it easier . The Story 's Epilogue / 215 " Nothing personal against Bentley , " he continued , " but we probably made a mistake bringing him in , especially when we did . It was n't good for us or fair to him . He was a big company man , from a big city ; that 's fine , but I think maybe the combination of Hauser-Moore and Janesboro was a culture shock for him ? and his wife . They never adjusted . " And frankly , Stu , I may have been naive . We had n't hired top people from the outside before , and I looked only at his track record ? his technical competence , personality , things like that . I did n't give enough attention to how he 'd fit into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iverson covered , I perhaps ignored our traditions , our firm culture . " " But we must n't overdo that culture bit , " Andretti broke in , " and overreact . I agree with the importance of tradition , but we must n't become inbred , parochial . Tradition can be a dead hand on the throttle as well as a positive influence . Any organization needs an infusion of new blood from time to time . " " I know , but carefully planned , " Hauser said thoughtfully . " Brought in gradually and at the right levels . And with attention to whether there is a common set of basic values . " After a short pause , " But let me go on with the other reasons we asked you to become CEO . I do n't see anyone in the company ready to take over , although two or three may be in a few years . That may have been one of my biggest mistakes , acting as if I 'd live forever and not considering succession . And none of us wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right person . A company can take only so many of those jolts , especially in a short time . " " I agree with that , " Andretti said , " and I can see that I had some of what was needed . One of my biggest challenges will be to build a good management team , most importantly to identify and prepare my possible successors . Of course , I know quite a few of the officers and executives but not well in most cases . You said there are two or three possibilities in the company ? " " Yes , and one of them might surprise you . Do you remember the problem with the relocation cost study ? The brush-off young Saunders got front Joe Hcndricks ? thc fact that there were errors 218 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM would have been a serious mistake , I now see , to have retooled and put the facility here . " What was wrong , " Andretti continued , " was the way it was handled . . . inadequate advance planning . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lousy PR . The steps we have taken since have , I believe , controlled the damage . There are wounds that will never heal , but even most of the terminated employees can see that Hauser-Moore has done everything it can to fulfill its obligations to them ? not just to pay lip service but to be seriously concerned about them as human beings . As a result of the retraining program and placement efforts , most of them now have jobs . . . maybe not exactly what they wanted , maybe not as good as what they lost , but jobs . Termination payments have helped with others . Most of all , efforts at communication have helped . You might call it sensitivity . " " I guess the ethics program is going well from all I hear . Is it all in place ? " " Most of it is , Mike . And I believe it has helped , in the aftermath of the relocation as well as generally . Maybe I 'm giving it too much credit , but it seems to have engendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the traditions , of the Hauser family will remain . " " It seemed to me from something he said at the last board meeting , " Lerner said with a smile , " that even Larry Albertson has mellowed . Or is that wishful thinking ? " " Well , " Andretti laughed , " it 's been a while since he 's lashed out at do-gooders . Seriously , though , Larry 's all right . He just wants to make sure the rest of us do n't get carried away . In several conversations we 've had , he 's had good things to say about the ethics initiative , as he calls it . I think what makes him feel best is the improved relationship around the community , at least part of which he acknowledges has come from the company 's stepping up to its obligations to stakeholders ? although we 'll never get him to use that term . " " And our long-range planning committee that you set up right after you came in is a very positive development , " I.erner The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well structured , with representation from both the board and line management . Naturally I 'm glad that you selected our Business Research Bureau at the college as consultants ; I 'm not completely objective , but I think that was a good move . It looks as if Hauser-Moore 's taking charge of its own future rather than just reacting . That does n't mean , of course , that there wo n't be problems , that we wo n't suffer setbacks , even that something wo n't sneak up on us . But we 're much better positioned , I think . " " Yes , " Andretti replied , " I think we are . The additional work that your Business Research Bureau has done has pretty well confirmed that Janesboro is not the place to continue our heavy manufacturing indefinitely ? certainly not the place to expand it . Hendersonville was a good choice for the new line of engines . And it , or some other place , is where we 'll gradually relocate our manufacturing . But now we can plan for it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's not all negative for Janesboro , though , " he continued . " Our engineering department is developing some exciting new high-tech products , ones that can very well be produced here . We 'll have to manage it carefully , but we can probably retain our presence here , possibly even enhance it , while avoiding future problems like last year 's relocation . " " Interestingly , like Carl Iverson and other ethicists say , " Lerner responded , " this shows that ethics is entwined in good business planning . The two go hand in hand . There has to be some give-and-take , sure , and we can never avoid hurting people occasionally . . . or making mistakes . But at least we can see what we 're doing , plan so as to balance the various rights and obligations , and come out with the best answer we can figure under the circumstances . " 220 / ASPECTS OF A CORPORATE ETHICS PROGRAM " Yes , " Stuart Andretti said thoughtfully , " at the risk of sounding stuffy , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? trying to run a profitable business while , at the same time , considering the rights of others ... being responsibly pragmatic . To steal the title one writer applied to an article , it 's " Ethics Without the Sermon . " ' CONCLUSION How to Get an Ethics Program Started All that has gone before is important ? sound and , it is hoped , interesting ? but only groundwork . Chapter 8 dealt generally with the elements of an effective company ethics program . But just how can a company get such a program under way ? This conclusion attempts to answer that question , at the same time taking the opportunity to emphasize the importance of , and to throw additional light on , the various elements . Companies deal with ethics in a variety of ways . Some have formal programs , perhaps headed by full-time persons in management and incorporating all or most of the elements discussed in Chapter 8 . Others have less-structured but still well-defined programs , sometimes coordinated through a committee of management and other employees . Still others incorporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without identifying them as such . Too many , unfortunately , although not denigrating the importance of ethical behavior , take it for granted and do not address training and implementation of ethics as a recognized , integral part of company strategy and operations . The goal of this " Conclusion : How to Get an Ethics Program Started " is to encourage companies to establish or enhance ef-
