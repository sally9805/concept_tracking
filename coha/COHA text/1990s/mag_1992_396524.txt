Random violence . Pointless murders . Nightly gunfire . Frightened citizens . A war zone ? No , Washington , D.C. Jack Russ was walking his Australian shepherd , Aussie , in Washington , D.C. 's Garfield Park one night early last week when he was approached from behind by two men . They held him at gunpoint and demanded his wallet and Rolex watch . Believing cooperation could save his life , Russ immediately turned over everything . But the pair apparently wanted him dead . " Smoke him , " one of the men reportedly said . The other stuck a pistol into Russ ' mouth and pulled the trigger . Had the quick-thinking Russ not suddenly turned his head , the bullet would have crashed through his brain , killing him . Instead , it went through his left cheek , and the robbers ran away , leaving Russ wounded but alive . The shooting caused an uproar in Washington . Not only did it take place just five blocks from the U.S. Capitol , but Jack Russ , 46 , is the sergeant-at-arms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , of a special police force that guards the Congress . Further , this was only the latest in a series of violent crimes near Capitol Hill . On Jan. 11 , Tom Barnes , 25 , a legislative aide to Democratic Sen. Richard Shelby , of Alabama , was shot to death on his way to a 7-Eleven near his home . Like so many of the city 's murders , Barnes 's death seemed utterly senseless : His wallet and money were still in his pocket . To Senator Shelby , who put up a $10,000 reward for the capture of Barnes 's killer , the homicide was " a terrible message to the American people : that you 're really not safe in the nation 's capital . " That may well be an understatement . Washington is in the grip of an epidemic of murder . No one is immune ; no one is free from fear . " I know staffers and Congressmen who are arming themselves ( illegally ) , " says Democratic Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell , of Colorado . " One guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to my trial than to my funeral . ' " The nation 's legislative capital has also become its murder capital . Although Washington 's 489 homicides in 1991 are numerically fewer than those in the bigger cities  --  New York City ( an estimated 2,220 ) , Los Angeles ( 1,039 ) or Houston ( 671 )  --  its murder rate of 78 killings per 100,000 residents is more than double that of any of those cities , " I believe the violence in our streets is the worst since the Civil War ( when Congressmen often carried guns for protection ) , " says Eleanor Holmes Norton , the District 's Representative in Congress . " It 's brother against brother . It 's domestic war . " Causes of the outbreak include the usual mix of drugs , youth , poverty and guns . But circumstances peculiar to Washington add to the mayhem . Most crime is concentrated in only a handful of neighborhoods , mainly black . Indeed , last year only a few whites  --  12 men and six women  --  were murdered in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is nearly three-quarters black , African-Americans made up 92 percent of all murder victims . Sadly , such violence often seems routine , but when congressional staffers such as Jack Russ and Tom Barnes become victims , the powerful spring into action . The two shootings , for example , brought calls for the death penalty in both the House and Senate . " It just so happens there have been a few high-profile crimes on Capitol Hill recently , " Norton complains . " But we 've got shooting ranges out here every night in sections of this town . " More typical  --  and no less horrifying  --  was the killing of 14-year-old Ricco Neal , the first person murdered in the District of Columbia in 1992 . He was an only child , a tall , lanky ninth grader , a school-yard comedian with a wide circle of friends . " Like Eddie Murphy without the bad language , " says his mother , Lavita , who works as a secretary . The New Year was less than two hours old when Ricco left a party across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Ricco and two friends piled into a Dodge Caravan parked at the curb , a man stood in the street , pointed a gun at them and opened fire . Then he took off running . The driver of the van , wounded but conscious , sped away , looking for help . He finally stopped at a gas station a mile away . When emergency medics arrived , Ricco Neal was lying on the ground  --  dead , with gunshot wounds to his head and body . " You would think that your child would be safe four doors up the street , " his mother says . " I could look right out the window and see the house . Who would imagine that something like this would happen ? " Sixteen days later police arrested Raymond Bigelow , 20 , a suspected gang member , and charged him with the slaying . As it happened , Bigelow was already awaiting trial in another case , a drive-by shooting at a Washington high school last September in which a teenager had been hurt . Such shootings have increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone can be shot at any time . That message was brutally driven home by the killing of Patricia Lexie , a 36-year-old newlywed whose death last November continues to haunt the city . She had grown up in Winston-Salem , N.C. , the seventh of 10 children who had all managed to make it through college . She had moved to Washington , had risen through the ranks of the American Product and Inventory Control Society and had dreams of starting her own business . Three years ago she met Freddie Lexie , a security consultant for a computer company , and they fell in love . They went to Bible classes on Wednesday evenings and to the Bethlehem Baptist Church in suburban Virginia every Sunday morning . On Saturday night , Nov. 16 , the couple had been visiting friends in Maryland and were planning to stay with them . But neither wanted to miss church the next morning . So they drove back to their apartment in Alexandria , Va. , using heavily traveled Interstate 295 . At first Freddie Lexie thought a car had backfired . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celica was shattered . And his wife , who had been chattering about her new godchild , Phillip Wilson , only a few minutes before , was now slumped and silent in the passenger seat . " It happened so fast , " he says . " There was a boom and the glass shattered . I looked over at my wife and I saw the wound in her jaw . I knew it had to be a gunshot . I reached over and touched her and thought , " Oh , my God , baby . " " Lexie pulled off at the next exit and into a filling station for help . Minutes later an ambulance arrived and rushed Patricia to nearby D.C. General Hospital , where she died . " It would have been easier to accept , " Lexie says , " if there had been a motive , at least . " There was none  --  in the conventional sense . Police say the man arrested for the crime four days later , eighth grade dropout Henry " Little Man " James , 19 , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " somebody , " he reportedly said . Then he allegedly aimed his 9-mm weapon at Patricia Lexie in the next lane and pulled the trigger . James proved remarkably easy for the police to locate . The day after he was identified by an informant , he called the FBI in Washington and dared the agency to find him . The FBI simply traced the call , and James was arrested within 20 minutes . Particularly infuriating to Patricia Lexie 's family is the fact that James had been recently arrested for another violent crime in the District  --  shooting a man on the street  --  and had been released on $1,000 bail , meaning he had to put up only $100 for a bond to gain his freedom . " My sister 's life was worth exactly $100 to the court system , " says her brother Derry Bigby . James is scheduled to go on trial May 22 for Patricia Lexie 's murder . Meanwhile he has been convicted on assault and gun-possession charges in yet another case , this one where he randomly shot and seriously wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the city . He faces a sentence of five years to life . Public outrage over the easy terms of his bail in the street shooting also led to swift action by the D.C. Council . On March 3 it unanimously enacted a law permitting District courts to presume that anyone accused of using a firearm during a crime is a dangerous person and , therefore , can be held without bond for 120 days . The area around the Capitol is one of the most desirable places to live in Washington . It is where roughly 50 U.S. Senators ( including Majority Leader George Mitchell ) and more than 150 members of the House maintain residences . Judged by the number of homicides , rapes , robberies and assaults tabulated so far for 1991 , it is also within the third most dangerous police district in the city . Nearly everyone who lives there has had a brush with crime  --  or knows someone who did . Just before Christmas , for example , Lucy Calautti , wife of freshman Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad , of North Dakota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun to her head and threatened to kill her , she said . Then he threw her to the ground and grabbed her purse . Not satisfied , he dragged her down the steps and into the street , where he demanded the keys to her car . Meanwhile her husband , who was inside their town house and heard her screams , dialed 911 . But it was Saturday night  --  and the lines were busy . He got a recording . Eventually the attacker fled on foot , and Calautti escaped uninjured . Last month police arrested ex-convict David Young , 35 , and charged him with the crime after Calautti identified him in a lineup . Even so , she and her husband are considering moving . " I 'm only prepared to be where I 'm safe , " she say 's . " If that means getting off the Hill , then that 's what we 'll do . " Republican Rep. Lawrence Coughlin , of Pennsylvania , and his wife , Susan , vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board , have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have installed an alarm system and put bars on the windows of their town house . But the added protection has n't erased the memory of what happened to them in the fall of 1988 . " My wife and I were asleep when the dog charged downstairs , barking like mad , " Coughlin recalls . " So ( my wife ) called the police while I went down to see what was going on . " What he found was an open window screen . When police arrived , they dusted for prints and took a report on the contents of Susan 's purse , which was missing . As the police were leaving , Coughlin went into the downstairs bathroom to turn off the lights  --  only to discover the intruder hiding there . " I guess it was n't very good judgment , " he says , " but I was so infuriated that I went after him . I was on top of him when the police came charging back in with their revolvers pulled and my wife screaming , " Please do n't shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it , but I was banging his head on the floor . I 'm not sure what I would have done to him if the police had n't come back . " Other legislators living on Capitol Hill have found their own methods of protection , although few have gone as far as Republican Rep. Susan Molinari , of New York , who lives just three blocks from her office . Whenever she knows late sessions will keep her at work after dark , she brings her large ( 85 lbs. ) , menacing-looking mixed-breed dog , George , to the office with her . " I have never felt as close to being at risk when I 'm out in Manhattan as I do here on Capitol Hill , " she says . Crime victims are not the only ones injured by a murder or a theft : Families and friends are casualties as well . For someone his age , Donald Marks , 20 , a clerk at the Department of Agriculture , has attended an extraordinary number of funerals  --  six in the last year alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youths , have died violently in the last five years . Of his seven closest friends in high school , only three are alive today . Marks has kept a running tally of the deaths , listing each one on lined notebook paper , recording the name , date , time , location and killer ( if known ) . " I wanted a record , " he says . " l wanted to remember . " He also wants to help . He has joined Washington police chief Isaac Fulwood Jr . ' s youth task force . The 100 or so young men and women in the program , aged 13 to 24 , give anticrime talks at schools , churches and recreational centers . Last October they ran a gun-amnesty program that resulted in 213 firearms , including a sawed-off shotgun , being turned in . And they have started a take-back-the-streets campaign , knocking on doors , trying to talk other kids into staying straight . " I tell them , " Do n't wait for someone in your family to be killed , ' " Marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . " " <p>
