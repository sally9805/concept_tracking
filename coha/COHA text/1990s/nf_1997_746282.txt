IS ISLAM EVER THE SOLUTION ? <p> ALGERIA 'S CIVIL WAR showed signs in early summer of sputtering to an end . After nearly six years of conflict and some 60,000 deaths , Algerians were fed up , exhausted , in despair . Most appeared prepared to accept President Liamine Zeroual 's political manipulations , which had seemingly squeezed his Islamist foes out of the system ; in a 1995-97 series of elections that international observers called reasonably free , Zeroual had won a mandate that bolstered his claim to legitimacy . He also claimed a decisive military victory over the Armed Islamic Group ( GIA ) , the fiercest of the rebel factions , after his security forces asserted that they had killed Antar Zouabri , the group 's chief , and his entourage . Indeed , a confident Zeroual went so far as to release Abassi Madani , the leader of the Islamic political opposition , who had been incarcerated since 1991 . <p> But contrary to expectations , the summer was the bloodiest in six years of war , and by fall , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimmer . Madani , having declared that his Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) had no intention of submitting to Zeroual 's political engineering , was again under arrest . Reports leaked by the government of secret talks with the Islamists seemed an act of desperation ; so was the fanfare accompanying a unilateral cease-fire declared by the Islamic Salvation Army , a marginal rebel force linked to Madani 's political party . Meanwhile , GIA bands , acting independently of the Islamist political leadership , had struck panic throughout the country with their bold and brutal attacks . The new attacks , moreover , led many to speculate that government forces were not helpless but were actively contributing to the rising death toll . <p> For six years , observers had assumed that intermittent massacres in Algeria , mostly in rural areas , were the work of the GIA . In most cases they were . But repeatedly this summer , bands of killers slipped into villages , some on the edge of Algiers , the capital , and spent the night hours slashing the throats of women , children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond to calls for help . <p> Many began to ask whether the security forces were the perpetrators . On-the-scene reporting of the violence has always been spotty , as journalists in Algeria have been the victims of both state intimidation and Islamist assassins . It has never been easy to identify the killers in this civil war . Yet the government , at the least , shares culpability in the massacres , in failing to control not just the GIA but renegade military units and local militias that it itself had armed . The pattern of violence was reminiscent of Algeria 's 1954-62 war of independence against France , when much of the peasantry asked only to be left alone . Punishing that indifference , both parties to the conflict brutalized innocents . In Algeria today , it matters less who did the killing than that the state is powerless to stop it , so that peace remains hostage to chaos . <p> Not only has the government been unable to restore order , but it has failed to address the weaknesses that gave rise to the conflict in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ameliorate hunger and widespread unemployment . A soaring population demands ever greater services , delivery of which is tainted by corruption and incompetence . Social inequity eats at public morale . And in politics , the government has chosen to ignore the Islamic movement , whose overwhelming electoral victory led in January 1992 to the military coup d'etat that triggered the civil war . <p> Though the circumstances of the war are uniquely Algerian , the problem is not . Secular governments , pursuing modernization , have failed throughout the Arab world . In Algeria as elsewhere , an Islamic movement with strong fundamentalist leanings was the only organized opposition to a self-serving , sclerotic regime . Many Arabs fear the war in Algeria may be an index of a future doomed to Islamist-inspired rejection of modernization , along with permanent instability . <p> Is Algeria 's bloodletting , they wonder , the fate that awaits Egypt and Tunisia , where the contest between mosque and secular state is already violent ? Could it also be that of , say , Syria , where a deep rancor toward the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Arab , the Islamic movement continues to surge , in spite of 75 years of stable secular rule . Even in countries as peaceful as Jordan and Morocco , where benevolent monarchs rule , Islamists wait for the next social trauma  --  war , famine , what have you  --  to make their move . <p> The evidence is not convincing that most Arabs believe Islam is the solution , that piety and prayer are the answer to their societies ' problems . Islamic movements may vary in character , but the revolutions in Iran and Sudan suggest that political Islam solves one problem  --  the overthrow of corrupt secular regimes  --  only by creating many others . In Algeria , the Islamic movement 's administration of nearly a thousand municipalities after its victory in the 1990 local elections prefigured limits on personal freedom without enhancing economic opportunity . Yet Arabs , frustrated by their authoritarian governments , turn to Islamists for lack of alternatives within their political systems . <p> The United States once argued for ending Algeria 's civil war through negotiations between the state and the Islamists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former colonial power , in opting for Zeroual 's strong-arm strategy . After meeting with Zeroual in September , U.S. Ambassador Ronald E. Neumann declared , " My government and I personally wish him every success as he seeks to move forward on the path he has publicly chosen . " Apparently Washington is betting that Algeria 's military regime , not militant Islam , will prevail . LIBERATION VS . SALVATION <p> FEW EX-COLONIES had such promising beginnings as Algeria . Unlike the Arabs who had been handed independence in the preceding era of decolonization , Algerians won theirs in 1962 in ferocious combat with France . The victory imbued them with a sense of achievement that was largely absent elsewhere in the Arab world . Algeria also emerged from the war with an educated elite , Arabic-speaking but fluent in French and at ease in the West . The country 's fertile fields yielded substantial wealth , as did its oil and gas reserves . Algeria inherited from the French a useful infrastructure , and it was near its natural markets . <p> Islamic militants argue that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government was not just secular ; it was despotic , corrupt , and rigidly socialist . When bad times came , the regime found that , while it had an army to enforce its will , its reservoir of popular support was practically dry . <p> Algeria 's problems date from the dawn of independence . The army seized power from the civilian authority that had directed the underground effort against the French and set up a regime modeled on Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser 's popular dictatorship in Egypt . A single party , the National Liberation Front ( FLN ) , ran the state , while real power resided in the military high command . In the quarter-century that followed , Algeria 's population nearly tripled , which would have been challenge enough for any regime . But the blundering FLN government financed its operations with foreign loans , using oil and gas resources as collateral . When oil prices collapsed in the mid-1980s , it was suddenly without funds . In October 1988 , riots with a distinctly Islamic flavor broke out . <p> Algeria had never thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while quick to put down political dissidence , had tolerated educational and community organizations run by mosques , convinced this would promote social stability by channeling the energies of young people  --  50 percent of whom had no jobs  --  into religion . Instead , it helped create a generation of Islamic militants . The 1988 riots swiftly escalated into bloody confrontations between the army and crowds of such militants , hundreds of whom were killed . The events also produced a leader , Ali Benhadj , the austere and mystical young cleric of a working-class mosque in an industrial quarter of Algiers . Benhadj demanded jobs , an end to corruption , and , more grandly , the " cleansing " of Algerian law of all principles contrary to Islam . He acquired a ready following among Algerians , Islamically inclined or not , who were persuaded by the massacre of rioters , if they had not been before , that the FLN state had to go . <p> The riots also undermined the confidence of Chadli Bendjedid , an ex-officer whom the army had named president in 1979 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge was a mistake . Although the French had introduced Algeria to democracy , they invariably cooked elections to favor their own interests , giving the process a bad name . Algeria , moreover , lacked the experience and the institutions  --  political parties , a free press , trade unions , human rights guarantees  --  considered essential to a democratic society . <p> In a constitution hastily drawn up in February 1989 , Bendjedid revoked the FLN 'S monopoly on power , authorizing free political parties , free speech , and a free press . Apparently persuaded by polls that the FLN would retain power via the ballot , he promised elections , first municipal and then parliamentary . Undeterred by the polls , Algeria 's Islamic movement mobilized for the voting . <p> The founding of the Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) was announced in March 1989 following an agreement among Algeria 's chief clerics . The name conveyed a party with not only a political but a spiritual mission . Yet the founders , while unanimously supporting the idea of an Islamic state , seriously disagreed about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideology and institutions unresolved . <p> Abassi Madani , a psychology professor with a British doctorate as well as a practicing imam , was named the party 's leader . Benhadj was second in command and quickly became the FIS 'S most recognizable voice . In brilliant sermons  --  a few of which landed him in detention  --  he advocated not only an Islamic state but armed jihad to attain it . Convinced by the Iranian Revolution that victory was near , Benhadj proclaimed more extreme positions for the FIS than the leadership was prepared to endorse . The much older and more pragmatic Madani acted as a restraint on his ideological and impetuous colleague . <p> The FIS joined some 60 other parties , most of them one-man operations , in registering to participate in the impending elections . Among the secular parties , the FEN , its wealth and organization intact , was by far the most formidable . The FIS , the most energetic of the religious parties , was its only real rival . Looking back , the confrontation represented a clear choice between secular and religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw the FIS essentially as a challenger to the status quo . They considered its taking on of the detested FLN more significant than its vaguely formulated Islamic program . <p> In June 1990 , eight million Algerians , some 65 percent of potential voters , cast their ballots in the first free , honest , multiparty election in the nation 's history . The results were stunning . The FIS won control of 853 of Algeria 's 1,541 municipalities , including Algiers . It received 54 percent of the total vote , including a huge majority among voters under 30 . The FEN came in a distant second with 34 percent . <p> But the FIS victory did not quell public demonstrations . When , two months after the election , Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait , Bendjedid 's regime supported the American-led coalition that landed troops in Saudi Arabia . Benhadj , defying the government , led his followers into the streets again , demanding that volunteers be recruited to fight against the Western forces on sacred Islamic soil . <p> The turmoil , which lasted for months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The FIS then called a general strike , and for the second time in three years soldiers fired into crowds of protesters , killing several hundred . In June the government arrested Madani and Benhadj , along with some 700 militants , claiming to have discovered stores of FIS arms . But by then , Bendjedid had agreed to schedule parliamentary elections for December 26 , 1991 , with a runoff three weeks later . <p> Over Benhadj 's objections , Madani issued instructions from his cell for the party to continue within the legal competition for power . The fall campaign proved unexpectedly calm , with candidates holding peaceful rallies and debating before orderly crowds . When the results were in , the FIS , disproving all the polls , stood ready to swallow up the government . Of 430 seats in parliament , the FIS won 188 outright and led in 140 of 199 outstanding contests . Moreover , it appeared likely to win two-thirds of the seats , enough to fulfill its campaign promise of replacing Bendjedid 's constitution with the framework of an Islamic state . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock . Bendjedid entertained the notion of giving the FIS a free hand in its social program in return for his retaining control of the defense and interior ministries . Such a deal , however , sat poorly with both the army and the FIS , which the street massacres had made into implacable enemies . On January 11 , 1992 , Bendjedid resigned , his departure ending the equivocation about who was in charge . For 30 years the army had let the FEN govern on condition that the party maintain order . Now its usefulness was at an end . <p> Three days later the army named a five-member High Council of State to assume the presidential functions . A moderate Islamist and a human rights activist provided a democratic facade , but the council was dominated by an army general . Its first decree dismissed the election results and canceled the runoff . The army 's action has since entered the national lexicon as the January coup d'etat . <p> In the wake of the coup , the FIS promised  --  at least until the government clarified its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renouncing its plan for an Islamic state . " But the army conducted a new mass arrest of FIS leaders , while sweeping Algiers and detaining anyone wearing the loose-fitting white tunics that identified FIS members . It also moved to regain control of the mosques , replacing fundamentalist imams by the dozens , cutting off loudspeakers , banning street gatherings . Over the next few weeks the government closed FIS offices , heavily curbed party press outlets , and removed the municipal officials elected in the landslide of 1990 . <p> The FIS launched a campaign of demonstrations , to which the army replied by killing 40 protesters in Algiers outside a fundamentalist mosque . The party leadership then proclaimed a march to bring down the state ; the army countered by bringing in forces from the provinces and positioning them along the parade route . Facing massacre , the FIS ceded off the march , backing down from the high-water mark of its power . <p> In March 1992 the FIS , after 29 months of legality , was declared formally dissolved . By then the killing by militants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first at police officers but soon at civilians , both in the cities and the countryside . The security forces retaliated with equal brutality , setting the current pattern of bloodletting . <p> The morality of the January coup has been much debated , inside and outside Algeria . No one disputes its illegality , but its defenders argue that the army , in heading off a reversion to medievalism , saved Algerian society . They cite the words of Islamist leaders as evidence that the movement , once victorious , would never agree to an election in which it might lose power . They contend that the violence of civil war is not of the army 's making but was imposed by the intrinsic fanaticism of Islamic movements . These arguments may contain some truth . Yet whoever examines the FIS recognizes that , from its beginnings , the front has not expounded a unified ideology , much less a single political strategy . TERMS OF OPPOSITION <p> BEFORE THE war of independence , Islam in Algeria was dominated by doctrines that were religiously moderate and politically mainstream  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the wartime leadership . After the war , however , when the regime became a Nasser-style dictatorship , Islam distanced itself from the state , drifting toward the model of Nasser 's Islamist enemies . Emulating Egypt 's Muslim Brothers , its ideology became increasingly fundamentalist and its strategy increasingly violent . <p> By the 1970s Algeria 's mosques were largely in the hands of militant imams . The movement 's majority called themselves salafi , a term that conveys dedication to a strict reading of the scriptures . The Islamic state they espoused would be governed by the sharia , traditional Islamic law . Followers of the salafi tended to be lower middle class and , even more often , rootless , jobless youths . When Khomeini 's forces won in Iran in 1979 , the salafi found a prototype not only for revolution but for clerical government . That was the vision they brought to the FIS . <p> Yet the legacy of Islamic moderation from the pre-independence era was not dead . Inside the movement were its heirs , known as the jazara , the Arabic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Algerian nationalism . The jazara faction , university-based and a bit elitist , favored the establishment of a modern Islamic state based on an updated interpretation of the scriptures . Between the jazara minority and the dominant salafi there emerged the tension between modernism and fundamentalism that prevails in our time throughout Islam . <p> The FIS also had a third faction , designated mujahideen ( " makers of jihad " ) , a term used for Muslim warriors . The mujahideen were at best a stepchild . Benhadj , though not a member , was a consistent sympathizer , but Madani was afraid of them , and many of the FIS 'S most esteemed clerics had no use for the aggressive conduct that they promoted . The mujahideen were drawn more to action than to ideology . Heir to the brutality of the war against France , they believed the Islamic state could be achieved only through armed struggle . <p> Their roots went back to 1982 , when Moustafa Bouyali , a guerrilla fighter against the French , launched an insurrection against the FEN 'S " impious state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a few dozen companions , captured the hearts of the politically alienated , who saw him as an Islamic Robin Hood . Finally , in February 1987 , the army ambushed and killed Bouyali on the outskirts of Algiers , and in the ensuing months killed or imprisoned most of his band . Bouyali imparted a legacy of violence to political Islam . After the January coup his followers , reinforced by comrades released from prison , re-formed their units . They picked up additional recruits among the " Afghans , " Algerians who had fought the Russians in Afghanistan . These " Afghans " are credited with shaping the mujahideen 's vicious tactics . <p> On Madani 's instructions , the FIS did what it could to bring the mujahideen under its command , but it encountered only contempt for preferring elections to jihad . There is no evidence that Bouyali 's followers , loosely organized as the Armed Islamic Group ( GIA ) , ever took orders from the FIS . For a time , the FIS commanded a few armed units under the rubric of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the war . The GIA were always the chief fighters , and as violence became more commonplace , they superseded the FIS in the public mind . With the help of television and the press , they co-opted the image of the Islamic movement . <p> The regime 's security forces have used the mass arrest and torture of young Islamists to penetrate the mujahideen . The tactic has weakened mujahideen units , but it has also led to a huge exodus of young men from civilian society ; ironically , the mujahideen became their only source of shelter . <p> Most mujahideen , insofar as they are ideological at all , clearly tend toward a narrow extremism . Their dispatches proclaim doctrines that are anti-women , anti-intellectual , and anti-foreigner , along with opposition to the secular state . Some of the mujahideen are common criminals , using Islam as a cover for banditry , kidnapping , and rape . The government contends that the criminals are the majority , but the claim is no doubt overblown . PEACE PARTIES <p> SIX YEARS OF civil war in Algeria have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . The FIS is in shambles , its dream  --  that its message would cause the state to collapse under its own weight , like the monarchy in Iran  --  having proved an illusion . Meanwhile , the security forces have been unable to quell the mujahideen . For now , Zeroual 's government seems to be controlled by the eradicateurs , the faction of the military leadership that refuses political compromise and insists  --  apparently with significant civilian support  --  on maintaining its efforts to crush the rebellion . But so far the eradicateurs have failed in that . <p> Zeroual , president since 1994 , is a general in his mid-fifties who came up through the army ranks . When the military chose him to replace the governing High Council of State , he was regarded as a cut above the rest of the officer corps in honesty and competence . Reports had it that he would pursue a settlement with the FIS , and he himself spoke of a dialogue " that excludes nobody . " In August <p> Madani notified Zeroual of the possibility of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Benhadj were transferred from prison to house arrest . But no dialogue ever took place . The collapse of preliminary haggling seemed to mean that both sides were subject to the veto of their hard-liners . The bloodshed rose to a new level . <p> Meanwhile , other talks opened in Rome . In November 1994 the Sant'Egidio Community , a peace group affiliated with the Vatican , convened a meeting of delegates from the FIS , the FEN , and the other opposition parties to draft a plan to end the war ; the government had been invited but declined to attend . The delegates in Rome represented parties that had received more than 80 percent of the vote in the 1991 parliamentary election . <p> From custody , Madani and Benhadj endorsed the meeting . If Sant'Egidio led to a dialogue with the government , Benhadj declared , he would " go himself into the mountains " to get the mujahideen to accept the terms . It was the first time that the FIS had agreed to sit down with Algeria 's secular parties . Never before had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readiness to compromise . <p> The Sant'Egidio platform was signed by all the parties in January . The secular parties joined the FIS in affirming the " enlightened Islamic principles " set forth in the 1954 declaration that had launched Algeria 's war of liberation . But the FIS also made significant concessions , agreeing to waive reinstatement of the results of the 1991 election , along with its claim to be Algeria 's legitimate government . It did not insist on recognition of what it called its right to armed struggle . Finally , it committed to alternance  --  going into peaceful opposition , like other parties , if voted out of office . <p> The Sant'Egidio proposals , unquestionably conciliatory , were offered not as an ultimatum but as an agenda to begin talks between the government and the parties on ending the civil war . Many Algerians placed great hope in the plan . Yet Zeroual turned it down flat . Noting its Vatican sponsorship , he called it a resumption of the Crusades ; television reports invariably discussed it against a background of a church and cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logically on a clause of the plan calling for the nonintervention of the army in political affairs . Zeroual , the army 's surrogate , could not tolerate such a radical shift in power . Two weeks after the Sant'Egidio signing , Zeroual returned Madani and Benhadj to prison . Benhadj , believed to be jailed somewhere in the Sahara , has not been heard from since . President Zeroual was planning to legitimize the state in his own way . HIS WAY <p> IN JUNE 1995 Zeroual announced that " transparent , free , democratic , and sovereign " elections for the presidency would be held the first week of November . The FIS , which was still banned , along with the legal parties represented at Sant'Egidio , boycotted the election . In addition to Zeroual , the candidates included a moderate cleric and two political unknowns , both secular . None urged a political settlement of the war . The campaign , which the mujahideen made no major effort to disrupt , proceeded without incident . The balloting , most observers agreed , was conducted fairly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than had been anticipated : Zeroual won 61 percent of the vote . Equally significant , 75 percent of the electorate ignored the boycott and went to the polls , making the abstention rate lower than in 1991 , the year of the great FIS victory . The figures suggested that Algerians had repudiated the overwhelming endorsement they had given the FIS four years earlier . The vote could be interpreted as a renunciation of their revolutionary aspirations . But another reading might be that a war-weary populace was now asking only for an end to the violence , which Zeroual seemed to be in the strongest position to provide . <p> After his victory , Zeroual , conspicuously passing over the FIS , invited the country 's other political forces to a conference to discuss Algeria 's future . All but one of the parties to the Sant'Egidio plan stood with the FIS in declining . The FEN broke ranks , after an internal coup . The party of Algeria 's liberation wanted back into the political game , if only as a secondary player . <p> Midway through 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative assembly . While not explicitly banning Islamic parties , the amendments barred the exploitation of religion  --  an ill-defined concept  --  for political purposes . They also established a new upper chamber , which the president would appoint , and gave him broad powers to rule by decree . Effectively , the amendments authorized Zeroual to govern without popular restraint . Their obvious intent was to keep any Islamic party from acquiring the power the FIS almost did in 1991-92 . <p> Algerians voted on the amendments in November 1996 , and according to the government , more than 85 percent gave their assent . The official tally was 12.7 million ballots cast , more than in the presidential election the year before . No outside observers were permitted to monitor the voting , however , and many Algerians , noting that polling stations had been virtually empty , dismissed the figures cynically . DEAD OR DORMANT ? <p> STILL , THE AMENDMENTS went into effect , apparently closing all doors to power for the Islamic movement . Was the FIS dead ? Many felt it had taken its last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The GIA , meanwhile , had hijacked its identity , undermining the popular loyalty the Islamic movement had once enjoyed . Zeroual had offered the people no more than a facade of democracy . His constitution now assured the presidency , acting for the army , of legal possession of the last word in running the Algerian state . <p> But where had the sentiment gone that produced a vote for an Islamic state in 1990 and again in 1991 ? Had the huge FIS victory been an illusion ? Had Algerians been , as secularists claimed , intent on voting the FLN out rather than the FIS in ? Had they never really been interested in an Islamic state at all ? <p> Certainly the Islamic movement does not think Algerians are prepared to abandon its cause . It continues to assert that the injustice of January 1992 will not prevail and that Algerians will , in the end , affirm its right to rule . Yet for the moment the president and the army are securely in charge . This past summer Zeroual conducted another election in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To no one 's surprise , the president 's party and its allies captured a substantial majority of seats . Zeroual , in releasing Madani from prison soon after , seemed to say that the civil war was over . But he could hardly have been more mistaken . The carnage , after a brief remission , resumed with a vengeance . <p> Yet Zeroual in the 1997 election had completed the reassembly of the parts  --  presidency , constitution , parliament  --  of the Algerian state . The damage to legality done in the January coup had ostensibly been repaired . Zeroual could make a plausible claim of legitimacy , which foreign governments , including the United States , were willing to accept . <p> Many Algerians , however , say that the Islamic movement is in hibernation , waiting for spring . When the movement awakens , they say , its political arm may no longer carry the FIS 's name , but it will profess the same commitment to a state based on Islam and the sharia . None of Zeroual 's changes , they insist , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Islamic government . <p> But the army is unlikely ever again to gamble with democracy , as it did in 1990 and 1991 . Nor is it likely to grant the opportunities for growth that the Islamic movement enjoyed in the decades after independence . It has learned the price of loosening its hold on Algerian society , and it possesses the power to keep the bonds tight . <p> Zeroual has erected the scaffolding of a state while shackling the society that fills the space within . The space now seethes with discontent . Algerians of all political beliefs hope the spilling of blood will abate . But they agree that the struggle for the nation 's soul is far from over . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By Milton Viorst <p> <p> MILTON VIORST 'S foreign reporting has appeared in The New Yorker and elsewhere .
