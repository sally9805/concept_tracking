<p> 1990 brought a bumper crop of novelty - from gee-whiz technological marvels to good-grief kiddie trinkets . We discovered new ideas and new investments , hot spots and hot products . Some were fancy , some were fun , some were fantastic and some were fiascos . Here 's USA TODAY 's look at those that soared - and those that did n't . Windows opens : Windows 3.0 is the Retin-A of personal computers : It gives old PCs a new face for just $ 150 - no surgery needed . <p> Introduced in May by Microsoft Corp . , Windows was billed as software that would make IBM PCs as easy to use as the Apple Macintosh . Surprise : high tech that lives up to its hype . Windows has sold 2.5 million copies and is expected to bring in $ 350 million of Microsoft 's estimated $ 1.8 billion revenue for 1991 . <p> " We view this as one of the milestones of the PC industry , " says analyst Michele Preston of Cowen &; Co . <p> It ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the making . Microsoft announced the first version in 1983 and delivered it in 1985 . What a bomb . It was difficult to use and did n't come close to imitating the Mac . A 1988 version was another ho-hum . Then came Windows 3.0 . " Microsoft has been trying to get this right for ... years , " says Richard Shaffer of Technologic Partners . " They 've finally done it . " Eastward ho : Reversing the longstanding clamor to get out , people actually rushed into Eastern Europe in 1990 - for vacations . <p> Americans love to witness history in the making . And communism 's collapse was one of the biggest chapters of 1990 , if not the best . Tourists eager to grab a piece of the crumbling Berlin Wall transformed East Berlin from a dreary communist outpost into a hot vacation spot . That meant lots of capitalist dollars for travel agents : 63% of agents in an American Express survey said bookings to Eastern Europe were way up from 1989 . Top destinations : Moscow , Budapest , Leningrad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Eastern European countries , " says Steve Alesio of American Express . And growing revenue for AmEx : Charges to its cards in Eastern Europe are up 60% from 1989 . PC power : Personal computers were wallflowers when they debuted in the early 1980s . But in 1990 , IBM , Tandy Corp . and Apple Computer introduced three low-priced models , and home PCs became the belles of the ball . Leading the conga line : the IBM PS/1 computer , which sells for $ 999 to $ 1,999 . <p> Part of the PCs ' new charm is price , as low as $ 750 . Technology such as microprocessors - fingernail-sized chips that are the brains of computers - costs a fraction of what it did in 1980 . And buyers finally believe PCs are useful : for home budgets , for taxes , for work brought home from the office . Four in 10 PS/1 buyers say they 're using the computer to run a business from their homes . Analysts say sales of home PCs jumped 11% this year , to 4.1 million units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PC by 1993 . Puts up : Looking for more excitement than the tumbling Dow ? Try betting on the Nikkei . <p> Foreign index put warrants - representing baskets of stocks trading in Japan , France or Britain - are in red-hot demand . Since they began trading on the American Stock Exchange in January , they 've soared to 15% of daily volume and boosted total volume on the once-floundering American Stock Exchange 9% from 1989 . <p> Warrants give holders the right to buy or sell a basket of stocks at a stated price within a specific period of time . Put warrants are a bet that stock prices will drop ; call warrants bet on a rising market . Both allow U.S. investors to profit from foreign markets ' volatility . The most popular are Japanese Nikkei put warrants , some of which tripled in value as Tokyo stock prices plummeted . <p> Other warrants are based on Britain 's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index and the Paris Bourse . Warrants on Germany 's DAX index may soon be traded , too . Ford floors it : Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-wheel drive when the Explorer rolled out last spring . <p> The Explorer - a sport-utility vehicle that replaced the compact version of the Bronco II - has given Jeep 's renowned Cherokee a good whacking and brought a batch of upscale buyers into the Ford fold . <p> Since Explorer 's late-March introduction , Ford 's share of the compact sport-utility vehicle market has zoomed to 23% from 13% . Cherokee 's has fallen to 17% from 21% . At least 150,000 Explorers have been sold . Says auto marketing consultant David Hillburn : " The Explorer is a real winner . " <p> Mazda is buying Explorers from Ford and selling them as Mazda Navajos - the first time a Japanese automaker has marketed a U.S.-built vehicle . Till now , it 's been the other way around . Ubiquitous Universal : Big banks should phone home : AT &T; is looting them of their most prized customers - credit-card holders . <p> AT &T; introduced its Universal Card - a Visa or MasterCard that 's also a long-distance calling card - in March , waiving the annual fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experts scoffed when AT &T; predicted that by year 's end it would sign up 2 million Universal accounts . But AT &T; hit 3.7 million in October and now says it could sign up 4.3 million accounts by Dec. 31 . <p> Already the fifth-largest card issuer , AT &T; could be king of credit cards by 1995 , says card expert Spencer Nilson . But analysts are n't sure if Universal will make a lot of money . AT &T; has not only offered to extend product warranties on goods bought with its card , but will give cardholders 10% discounts on long-distance calls and back them in disputes with merchants . Those promises could be costly . Path to perfection : For U.S. companies battling Japanese products , a new quality improvement process from Motorola Inc. is a hot commodity . <p> Motorola has taught its technique - called Six Sigma - to more than 7,000 managers from 1,000 U.S. companies and government agencies . <p> Six Sigma standards allow no more than 3.4 defects per million parts produced , or 3.4 mistakes per million services performed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistical tools to find the source of every defect and mistake . <p> A legion of firms , led by IBM Corp . and Digital Equipment Corp. , has begun to apply Six Sigma to operations . Motorola 's aim in spreading Six Sigma : Prevent the USA from losing its industrial base - the companies that just happen to be Motorola 's best customers . Slap happy : Bright idea , right ? <p> Wrap a piece of neon-colored vinyl around a thin band of flexible steel , slap a price tag on it and head for your nearest teen-ager . Then sit back and watch as the dough rolls in . <p> That 's pretty much the story behind the slap bracelet , a $ 2 trinket now found wrapped around any self-respecting teen-ager 's wrist . As fads go , this one is a classic : Its origin is murky , and no one really knows what the attraction is . But theories abound . <p> " They 're noisy , " says Jane Pratt , editor of teen magazine Sassy . " When you slap it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the fraternity pin of the ' 90s . Says Pratt : " Girls ( slap bracelets on ) guys they like . It 's , like , easier than asking a guy out . " And they 're revolutionary . Teachers hate them . In fact , some schools have banned them . Sales are sizzling anyway . Ken Czar , vice president of Troy , Mich. - based Button-Up , wo n't give specific figures but says , " We 're talking millions of dollars . " <p> How long will it last ? " I give it a year - tops , " predicts Pratt . Scan it : Want to copy this entire issue of USA TODAY into your personal computer ? Now you can , at nearly 500 words per minute . The Typist , a hand- held scanner made by Caere Corp . of Los Gatos , Calif. , is probably the closest thing yet to a vacuum cleaner for electronic bits and bytes . It 's getting rave reviews . <p> " It 's really geared for the everyman at the office , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the price : $ 700 for an Apple Macintosh ( out now ) and $ 600 for IBM PCs ( coming in 1991 ) . <p> The Typist can transfer words or numbers from paper right into the computer program you 're working on , be it word processing or electronic spreadsheets . Other scanners require you to open a separate file in your computer , scan a document , save it , then bring up the previous file to transfer the information . The Typist can take information from almost any printed text , no matter what typeface . About the only thing it ca n't do quickly is scan images ; that is done like other scanners . Small talk : Is that a pack of cigarettes or your telephone ? This year , pocket phones got even smaller . <p> Motorola 's MicroTac , a mini cellular phone introduced last year , is less than 6 inches long , weighs 12.3 ounces and costs about $ 700 . Competitors quickly introduced even smaller models . In September , Mitsubishi came out with DiamondTel , a $ 1,585 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car 's sun visor and is the size of a dollar bill . In November , Fujitsu America unveiled the Pocket Commander . It 's even lighter , at 10.2 oz. , and tinier - slightly larger than a pack of 100mm cigarettes . It costs $ 1,195 and has a battery that lets people talk 80 minutes before recharging . <p> Expect the cost - and the size - of pocket phones to keep coming down . And by the mid-1990s , the cost of calls will shrink , too . " Personal communications networks " - cellular networks that transmit on radio frequencies - will handle more phone traffic less expensively . Light up for less : Lower-priced cigarettes caught fire in 1990 , sending long-held beliefs about cigarette marketing up in smoke . <p> Smokers ' faces lit up when they saw these brands in stores . The value- priced brands cost up to 50% less than regular-priced brands . <p> Smokers used to shun cheaper cigarettes , fearing their lower-class image . But that perception is burning away as full-priced brands reach $ 2 a pack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , up from 11.4% in 1988 . <p> Top tobacco marketer Philip Morris USA is making a big push into value brands . It 's spending tens of millions of dollars to launch Bucks - aimed squarely at rival R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. ' s full-priced Camel line - and Bristol , an even lower-priced brand . Reynolds , which sells the top value cigarette , Doral , is countering with Magna . Magna is value-priced , but ads do n't say so . Hold the fat : Can food marketers make more money taking out what 's bad for you than putting in what 's good for you ? Compare this year 's boom in fat-free foods with the boom-gone-bust in oat bran . <p> Packaged-goods giants are racing each other to reformulate their brands to remove fat . An estimated 150 fat-free products came to market during 1990 , from salad dressings to baked goods to cheese . <p> Not all the fat-free moves are fattening up bottom lines : Witness sluggish sales of Simple Pleasures , a frozen dessert made with Monsanto Co. ' s fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but New Product News Editor Martin Friedman says it 's " not getting too much exposure . " <p> Next year , the government could give the go-ahead to a fake fat called olestra , which replaces oils and shortenings . Then look for food firms to sell fat-free snacks such as french fries and potato chips . Boffo bird : A chicken laid the golden egg for Burger King . The fast-food chain introduced a grilled chicken sandwich in February , and now sells 1 million a day . Initially , the BK Broiler " was targeted for women and kids . But everyone is eating it , " says spokeswoman Cori Zywotow . <p> Other fast-food chains rushed to follow . Wendy 's cooked up its own grilled chicken sandwich in October . - And McDonald 's is testing a grilled chicken sandwich . <p> Consumers like grilled chicken because it has less fat than hamburgers or fried chicken sandwiches . And it 's " not the same old thing , " says restaurant consultant Nancy Kruse . <p> " Burger King probably was forced into expanding its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was running out of any growth among hamburger enthusiasts . " <p> Written by Dennis Cauchon , James Cox , Stuart Elliott , James R.
