Section : ROCK &; ROLL <p> After years of near misses , the Verve have scored big by staying true to The darkness at the Heart of rock &; roll <p> RICHARD ASHCROFT , SINGER AND chief songwriter of England 's newest hitmakers , the Verve , is on a roll . Sitting in a first-class compartment of the Eurostar express train traveling from London to Paris , he has no qualms about stating the grand scale of his ambition . <p> " British groups have been too afraid to go for it , " he says . " We 're the first generation for a while that 's said , ' Yeah , let 's have it . We 'll take it on . ' I 'm not interested in being a painter or a sculptor who people only realize was great 50 years after he 's dead . We want to do the business , and we want to do it now . We want to be a modern-day Led Zeppelin . ROLLING STONE should be putting us on the front cover now . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , Ashcroft has always talked a good fight . But these days , his confidence knows no bounds . The Verve  --  a group that was once described as " the greatest rock &; roll band from Wigan " ( a town in the north of England ) and seemed destined to go down in history as just another bunch of beautiful losers after splitting up in 1995  --  have become one of this year 's biggest success stories . Their transcendent third album , Urban Hymns , has topped the U.K. charts for weeks , assisted by two striking singles : " Bitter Sweet Symphony , " a string-soaked song of exquisite yearning , and " The Drugs Do n't Work , " a timely evocation of post-Brit-pop come-down blues . ( By early November , " Bitter Sweet Symphony " had already reached No. 14 on the U.S. Modern Rock chart and was in heavy rotation on MTV . ) <p> Ashcroft , 26 , is accompanied on this trip by his statuesque girlfriend , keyboard player Kate Radley , who is temporarily on leave from her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dotted about the carriage : guitarist Nick McCabe , bass player Simon Jones , drummer Peter Salisbury , and keyboard player and guitarist Simon Tong . McCabe , whose rift with Ashcroft was one of the principal reasons for the group 's split , keeps his personal-stereo earphones clamped in place . <p> By his own admission , Ashcroft has always had a huge chip on his shoulder , the result of an upbringing scarred by the death of his father , an unemployed office worker , when Ashcroft was 11 . He formed the Verve with his schoolmates McCabe , Jones and Salisbury . After they left school and signed onto the unemployment register , they would lock themselves in rehearsal rooms for sessions that lasted up to 11 hours , playing their own songs and listening to other music . " We started with the basics  --  the Byrds , Buffalo Springfield , " Ashcroft says . " Then we got into soul , then jazz ... Funkadelic , John Lennon , Miles Davis , Big Star , Patti Smith , Can , Coltrane . " <p> The Verve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1993 , was a majestic affair , a modern-rock mosaic soaked in languorous swaths of 1990s psychedelia that recalled in places the Rolling Stones at their most woozy and the Velvet Underground at their most velvet . The critics were soon reaching for next-big-thing superlatives , but the album sold barely 30,000 copies . <p> It was around this time that the Verve were supported on tour by an unknown group called Oasis , and a lasting alliance was forged . Oasis ' Noel Gallagher is said to have written " Cast No Shadow " about Ashcroft : " He walks along the open road of love and life/Surviving if he can . " <p> " I 'm flattered  --  if he wrote it about me , " Ashcroft says . " I 've never talked to him about it , but bits of it seem to fit my description . At one point I did think I was going to be the Gram Parsons or the Nilsson of our generation , the guy who 's got a bit of talent , and people know who he is , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I could have stood it . I just had to make more things happen . " <p> For a while , the Verve  --  particularly Ashcroft  --  developed a reputation for making the wrong things happen . A series of mishaps on the Lollapalooza tour of 1994 culminated in Ashcroft 's being stretchered off to a hospital in Kansas . The singer , who was suffering from severe dehydration , thought he was going to die . <p> " The next morning , " he says , " I got down and kissed the ground , I was so glad to still be here . I think we all go through conflicting emotions about death , but as an artist , I think you have to go to these places to understand where they are and why they 're there , and see what you 're gon na get from it . But you ca n't keep going there  --  otherwise you just turn into another Roky Erickson or another Arthur Lee . You 're just another space cadet that never came back . " <p> As the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heedless of his surroundings , recalls the making of the Verve 's second album , A Northern Soul ( 1995 ) , a process that eventually caused their breakup . " We recorded it with Owen Morris producer of Oasis in a studio in Wales , " he says . " The first few weeks were brilliant , but we took it too far , and it all went a bit Lord of the Flies . There was stuff that 'd make your toes curl  --  driving cars at 120 mph down narrow country roads , just generally dancing ' round the fire  --  and we all crashed to earth at the same time . But I 'm really glad we went through it . It taught us not to abuse what we 've got . " <p> The band split after a disappointing gig at a festival in Scotland , and although the album was rapturously received , it ended up selling only about 60,000 copies . Ashcroft entered a dark period that would inspire the desolate lyric of " The Drugs Do n't Work . " <p> " Drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " It 's like the cheese with the wine . But it 's a problem when people get to a stage where they 're saying , ' I ca n't sing ' or ' I ca n't write a song ' without being in that state of mind . That definitely happened to me . And sometimes that is the situation and you have to put your hands up and say that this thing I 'm doing is n't having the desired effect . It 's got nothing to do with Nancy fooking Reagan whatsoever . " <p> After McCabe and Ashcroft reconciled earlier this year , the Verve reconvened . The period apart transformed the band into a more cohesive unit . Moreover , the British public had become satiated with the charms of Brit pop and was ready to embrace a rock &; roll group working closer to the beautiful darkness at the source . <p> The Verve 's comeback single , " Bitter Sweet Symphony , " was a huge hit , but they paid dearly for using a small sample of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album produced by former Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham . The Verve 's manager , Jazz Summers , describes Allen Klein , who owns the publishing rights to all the Stones ' material from the ' 60s , as " the hardest man I 've ever had to negotiate anything with in my life . " The song was eventually credited to Oldham , Mick Jagger and Keith Richards . <p> " It took us a long time to put that song together , " Ashcroft says . " I 'd be a fool to say I did n't feel angry about it . All we used from ' The Last Time ' was three chords , a bongo and a bell . The rest of it , the words , everything else , was ours , and they effectively took it away from us . But I 'm not gon na moan for the rest of my life about losing some money on one track . " <p> The band 's summer tour of Britain , which ended with three shows supporting Oasis in London , prompted scenes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American dates , with an extensive tour slated for next spring , Ashcroft promises more of the same . " To be a rock &; roll band nowadays , " he says , " you have to be something else . People have been to a club at 1:30 in the morning when their ecstasy 's coming up and they 're in touch with the universe . So you 've got to take them as high as that . Higher . <p> " Mind you , I 'm sure America 's had enough of hearing , ' Here 's another great British group that 's going to take over your country . ' " <p> Ashcroft checks himself on the brink of expressing a modest thought . <p> " I mean , it must get a bit boring , ' cause they 've probably been let down nine times out of 10 , " he says . <p> But not with the Verve ? <p> " Well , obviously not ! " he responds , chuckling mischievously . " Listen , if you come from where we come from , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It keeps you dancing , and it keeps you believing . But I 'm at the point now where I can stand back a bit and let the music do the talking . One thing Americans will appreciate is that this music 's from the fooking soul .
