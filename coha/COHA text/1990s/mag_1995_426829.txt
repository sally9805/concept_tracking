<p> Q. This year I planted a band of . colorful caladiums in a shady spot in my yard , and they flourished . But cold weather is coming , and I know that they are not hardy here.What is the best way to over- winter them indoors ? Should I just take cuttings ? I do n't want to buy new plants next spring . K.S. , Wilmington , Del . <p> A. The best approach is to lift the tubers from the ground before frost . Shake the soil from them and leave them in a sunny location to dry for 7 to 10 days . If rain or frost is forecast , move the tubers indoors temporarily . <p> After this drying period , pluck off the withered leaves from the tuber , and brush off any remaining soil . Store the tubers over the winter in a box or basket filled with dried vermiculite or perlite . Place the container where the temperature will not drop below 60 degrees Fahrenheit . Next spring , plant the tubers in the garden when the soil temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a method for making concrete garden fixtures look old and more attractive ? A.R. , Louisville , Ky . <p> A. Try this recipe from Dan Franklin , a landscape architect in Atlanta . First , rub the concrete surface with a steel brash to roughen the surface . Collect a few handrials of moss from the woods or a moist shady spot . Put the moss into a bucket and add a handful or two of composted cow manure . With a trowel , mix the ingredients together , making sure that you break up the moss into small particles . Next , stir the mixture slowly while adding buttermilk ; you 've added enough when the solution takes on a soupy consistency . Brush the mixture on the concrete . In several weeks , moss will begin to grow , creating the impression that the concrete has been around for years . <p> Q. Three years ago we purchased a house located on land that was once an established nursery . We have found some wonderful specimens , particularly a shrub that someone told us was called Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like corkscrews , except for some tall , straight stalks that emerge from the center . How did this shrub get its name , and how do I go about propagating it ? C.M. , Racine , Wis . <p> A. Corylus avellana ' Contorta ' was discovered growing in a hedgerow around 1863 near Frocester in Gloucestershire , England . It is commonly known as Harry Lauder 's walking stick , named in honor of the twisted walking stick wielded by the Scottish baritone Sir Harry Lauder ( 1870-1950 ) , whenever he appeared onstage to sing ballads and comic songs . Harry Lauder 's walking stick is almost always grafted onto European filbert ( Corylus avellana ) understock , which , as you 've discovered , suckers heavily . These suckers should be promptly removed at the base . To propagate ' Contorta ' on its own roots , take cuttings of shoots in late spring and summer when the wood is firm but still growing . Dip the cuttings in a rooting hormone intended for woody plants and stick them in a container of equal-parts perlite and coarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off at the top and set it in indirect sunlight . Rooting should occur in six to eight weeks . Plants that have made vigorous shoot and root growth by the fall can be transplanted into the landscape . If the cuttings have made little , if any , shoot growth , overwinter them in pots in a cold frame and wait until the last freeze in the spring before transplanting them . <p> Q. I have noticed that some varieties of amaryllis naturally produce offsets , which grow into bulbs that flower within a few years , while other varieties do n't . Is there a method that I can use to propagate amaryllis varieties that produce no offsets ? K.K. , Minneapolis , Minn . <p> A. Yes , you can , through an asexual propagation technique called scaling . The best time to carry out this procedure is in late fall and early winter when the bulb is dormant . Cut off the roots from the base of a large bulb , leaving the basal plate intact . Cut off one-half inch from the top . Divide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate . Then subdivide each half until you have wedges one-half inch wide , each with a piece of the basal plate . Peel off any dead outer scales from each section , leaving at least two scales . Do n't allow the scales to dry out . Plant the scale , s vertically , buried one-third of their length deep in a fiat of moist vermiculite . Cover the flat with a layer of polyethylene to conserve moisture and maintain high humidity . Move the flat to a brightly lit spot where the temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit . In six to eight weeks tiny leaves should appear at the base of each scale . Remove the plastic covering before these leaves touch the plastic . After three months new bulbs should have formed , allowing you to repot each plant . With good culture , you can expect to see them flower in about two years . <p> Q. I have trouble growing a florist 's gloxinia . I nurture it the same way I handle African violets , which I can grow successfully . Unfortunately , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buds turn brown , and to my great chagrin , the plant dies . J.C. , Woodbury , N.J. <p> A. The symptoms that you describe could be caused by a fungal disease , such as gray mold ( Botrytis cinerea ) , which is favored by poor ventilation , or by a soil-borne root-rotting pathogen whose attack was triggered by overwatering . <p> A gloxinia needs more light than an African violet , so place it in a well-ventilated spot receiving bright , indirect sunlight . If you have fluorescent lights , expose the gloxinias for at least 12 hours a day . The temperature should be at least 65 degrees Fahrenheit . Keep the humidity high around the plant by placing it on a tray of moist pebbles . <p> Water your gloxinia when the medium feels dry to the touch . Avoid wetting the leaves when watering . Do n't let the medium dry out completely because it will cause the developing flower buds to abort . When your plant has stopped flowering and when it appears to have finished its growth cycle , discontinue watering and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the leaves have dried , remove the tuber from the pot and pluck the leaves off . Brush off the medium and store the bare tuber in a dry , well-ventilated location out of direct sunlight . Check the tuber monthly for signs of new growth . Pink sprouts emerging from the tuber signal the time for repotting . Although florist 's gloxinia ( Sinningia speciosa ) is frequently sold in bloom during the winter months , it normally flowers in the spring and summer . <p> Use a light , porous , commercially prepared potting mixture suitable for African violets , or prepare your own by mixing equal parts soil , peat moss , and perlite . Fill the pot about halfway or three-quarters , and rest the tuber in the center . Add more medium to the pot to within one-half inch of the rim . When you 're done , the tuber should be barely covered and resting at the bottom of a slightly concave depression . Water sparingly at first , then more heavily as the shoots enlarge and the leaves expand . <p> For more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the American Gloxinia and Gesneriad Society ( write to the Membership Secretariat , M.

Over the past 15 years we have thinned it out , cut it back , left it alone , lightly fertilized it ... but still no flowers . Is it a lost cause ? We 'll try anything ! E.S. , Weston , Conn . <p> A. Before you call it quits , try to figure out the exact cause of your forsythia 's failure to bloom . If the border is located in too shady a spot , the forsythia wo n't initiate flower buds . Selectively thinning the canopy of the surrounding trees to admit more sunlight should help . Have the flower buds been pruned away ? Forsythia , like other spring-flowering shrubs , produces its flower buds during the summer months . Prune your forsythia by removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out some of the new shoots at the base . Have your local county cooperative extension office test your bed for soil pH and fertility . A nutrient imbalance or deficiency may affect flowering . An excessive amount of nitrogen will stimulate vegetative growth at the expense of flower bud development . <p> Horticulture , The Magazine of American Gardening , we/comes questions from readers .
