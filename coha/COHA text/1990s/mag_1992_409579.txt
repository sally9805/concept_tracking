In the mid-1980s , movie director Jonathan Demme read a newspaper article mentioning a priest engaged in a running battle with his local police department in Harlem . The cops kept parking their cars on the sidewalk near his church , blocking pedestrians ; every time they did , the priest would paste paper on their windshields . " I saw it was Robert Castle , and I said , " Could that possibly be my cousin Bobby ? ' " says Demme . " I dismissed it because it did n't make sense that Bobby would be in trouble with the police . " Then Demme laughs . He knows better now . In fact it was his cousin Bobby , and it turns out that the 62-year-old priest , head of St. Mary 's Episcopal Church in Harlem , has been in some kind of trouble with the police more times than he can remember . In celebration of his cousin 's efforts to promote social justice and racial equality , Demme , director of the Oscar-winning Silence of the Lambs , has made Cousin Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a labor of love . When Demme , 48 , was growing up on New York 's Long Island , he idolized his older cousin , a St. Lawrence University football star . " He was the Tom Cruise of the family , " says Demme . But the Demme and Castle clans drifted apart  --  until 1986 , when Bobby , newly arrived in New York City , decided to track his cousins down . He called Robert Demme , Jonathan 's father , who put him in touch with his cousins , Rick , a dude-ranch owner ; Peter , a carpenter ; and Jonathan ( who lives in Nyack , N.Y. , with wife Joanne Howard , an artist , daughter Ramona , 4 , and son Brooklyn , 2 ) . Castle knew Demme was a filmmaker but had never seen one of his movies . At the same time , Demme , fresh from making Married to the Mob , was casting about for a documentary subject  --  one that would , as he says , " put a human face on the parts of ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violent news bite . " When Castle called , Demme went up to West 126th Street in Manhattan , where St. Mary 's , small and beautiful , sits between two housing projects near the elevated train tracks . Says Demme : " I saw this guy who was just so passionate about the vital need for social change  --  a minister trying to accomplish things against incredible odds in this neighborhood . " Demme had found his subject . For his part , Castle " was a little hesitant , " he admits . " Why make a movie about me ? " But he agreed , and the cousins began filming in May 1989 , continuing whenever Demme could take a break from Lambs ( in which Castle has a tiny walk-on role leaving a plane at the end of the film ) . In the film , which Demme calls the " most overproduced home movie in the history of home movies , " Jonathan follows the tireless Bobby on his daily rounds , asking questions and drawing out stories as Castle pounds away at the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poor , white and black . " The slogan of ( this ) community goes , No justice , no peace , " Castle says . " The people that are comfortable can not expect to be comfortable at the expense of everyone else 's suffering . " Such rhetoric is familiar to anyone , like Demme , who came of age in the ' ' 60s , but cousin Bobby made it sound fresh and real . " Suddenly he does not seem anachronistic to me anymore , " says Demme . " His voice seems vital , not only in this neighborhood but on a very real national level . " Yet Castle expends most of his energy at the local level , effecting change one repaired pothole at a time in St. Mary 's predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhood . He started a health center for AIDS patients across the street from St. Mary 's , and a program to deliver mail to the homeless . " When any Hispanic people have any trouble , he is present , " says Rafaela Moquete , the priest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's there for the entire congregation . " Says Castle : " I hope this movie is a piece of the struggle . I hope it speaks to white people . A lot of good white people who are sitting on the sidelines need to get involved . " Castle 's involvement began during his childhood in Jersey City . The pastor of his family 's church " sold me a great bill of goods , that I could be a ( football ) coach and still be a priest , " he says . After college he went on to Berkeley Divinity School at Yale , graduating in 1955 . In 1960 he took a job at St. John 's Church in a Jersey City neighborhood that had a growing black population . He became active in the civil rights movement and was first arrested in 1963 , when he and several members of the Congress of Racial Equality protested the hiring policy at a White Castle restaurant . ( Bobby says the headline in the local paper read WHITE CASTLE ARRESTED AT WHITE CASTLE . ) " He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrow , now a Black Panther there . Castle stepped down from St. John 's in 1969 to allow a black priest to fill his spot and , unable to find another job , moved his family  --  first wife Nancy and their four children  --  to Vermont , where he coached high school football , was part-time rector of two churches and helped run a general store . ( He and Nancy split up in 1985 . In 1987 he married his second wife , Kate , 55 , an artist . ) He moved to New York City in 1985 , working with the mentally-ill homeless until he heard about the opening at St. Mary 's six years ago . Charles Kelly , a member of St. Mary 's who helps out in the church 's soup kitchen , says that Castle " is the kind of person who has to speak the truth , no matter what . We need to hear that . Sometimes we can get complacent . Sometimes we can get used to the abandoned buildings . " Cousin Bobby , playing in one New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a moving and fully formed portrait " ) and on public television in Spain , has set Castle up for some ribbing in the neighborhood . He says he is retiring from the movies , but Demme is n't so sure . " I 'd like his work to be part of my work , " says the filmmaker ( now making two documentaries about Haiti ) of his long-lost cousin and newfound friend . After spending time with Castle , Demme says , " I 'm a believer in small victories . For many years I sat on the sidelines complaining about things . ( Now ) I would rather channel that energy into tiny attempts to help things here and there . I agree with Cousin Bobby . I do n't think we should give up . " <p>
