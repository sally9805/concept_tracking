Mei . <p> " It 's Mei , it 's Mei ; hello Mei-mei ! " cries the little girl merrily , flying to embrace the slight young woman who has shyly stepped into the apartment 's tiny front hall . <p> Sometimes , on the bus downtown , Mei wishes she were spending a quiet Friday evening at home . But Anna is such a dear , droll child . She knows Mei is n't really just a baby sitter . <p> Officially , Leung Mei is a graduate student in sociology . She arrived from Beijing four years ago on an open-ended student visa to join her husband Fang Lu at Columbia University , where he teaches and pursues postgraduate research in physics . Although Mei 's family is considered comfortably well-off in China , money seems tighter here , there are so many more things to buy and do , more to pay for out of your purse every day . A month after her arrival , another Chinese girl at school told her about American women being so overwhelmed by even one baby that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small cousins she had been saddled with , and accompanied her friend to a child-care agency recruiting foreign students with a few hours a day to spare . <p> At first , she worked three afternoon for three different women , friends whose babies were each about six months old . They were two girls and a boy , but so young that it did n't make much difference , except that Mei had to be reminded to wipe the girls from front to back and not the other way . <p> Actually , it turned out that she did n't know much about taking care of infants . But along with her poor English , her inexperience was something the mothers seemed willing to put up with . They must have seen how hard she was trying , she thought , how serious and responsible she was , always there , always on time . The woman who was last to take Mei on was especially impressed that her daughter - that was Anna - never cried when she left , and imagined it was because Mei kept her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Mei gave more credit to the child 's own happy , trusting nature . Still , she was pleased to be well regarded . For some reason , it was n't easy to get good people to do this work , even though the pay was fine , five dollars an hour . Later , she realized that she probably could have gotten six just by asking , but at the time she did n't know enough about Americans . <p> The woman whose household seemed the richest was the one who most took Mei for granted ; eventually , she started standing her up , going off for long weekends and forgetting to tell Mei not to come on Friday afternoon . Mei was n't very sorry that this one decided to hire someone full time when she got pregnant again . ( Though it would have been nice to hear it directly from her , instead of just never being called for work again when the family 's long summer vacation was over . ) <p> The second woman , a nervous , fussing , slow-to-smile one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , " did n't let on that her family was moving out of the city until she surprised Mei one day by staying in the apartment during her visit to pack boxes in the big bedroom . Two weeks later , they were gone . That left the third woman , who said she was an artist and took a small notebook with her when Mei came to stay with little Anna , Wednesday afternoons , one to four . Mei did n't know where the mother went , though she sometimes mentioned the park , or the museum , and one time laughed about sitting at a cafe , trying to sketch out ideas for the time when she would be able to work again . <p> She informed Mei well in advance of that event , long before Anna , almost two , actually started playschool . She added that they did n't want to lose Mei altogether . Could she babysit one early evening week instead ? The woman and her husband studied tai chi , and they could go to Friday night class together again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though it meant that Lu would be along for a few hours then , and their first dinner of the weekend would be very , very late . But the woman had always been kind to her , the little girl easy and affectionate , and she felt an obligation . Perhaps she would have missed them too . By now , a year of Friday evenings have passed , and though Mei 's studies no longer leave time for babysitting day jobs , she faithfully keeps her appointment with Anna each week . <p> Mei likes to arrive a few minutes earlier than six , making sure she is not too early before she knocks . She has only been late once , delayed by a water main break that tied up all the bus and subway lines . That evening , she ran more than ten blocks without stopping , in her toe-pinching patent-leather flats . The woman got to her class on time . <p> The greetings are always cordial . The woman often tells her that she looks very nice , almost as if she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some frumpy peasant dress . But then , most Americans do n't know anything about the new China . Anna , of course , regards Mei as a wonderful friend whose visits she can scarcely stand to wait for . That is the way Mei likes it . She definitely does n't like feeling , as in the house of that other , rich young mother , that she is merely a temporary employee . She did n't think it encouraged that little boy to treat her with any respect either . <p> Every Friday , Anna 's mother tells her all over again about Anna 's dinner being ready on the kitchen counter , and about warming her bedtime milk . Each week , the woman reminds Mei about the list of emergency phone numbers on the refrigerator , about not opening the door for anyone , about not answering the telephone unless she hears the woman 's own voice announcing herself over the phone machine speaker . Mei is n't insulted by what might seem a lack of confidence in her understanding of what is , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , that it has more to do with the woman 's anxiety than with her . The mother wants to be sure that she 's done everything she can to make leaving her little girl all right . <p> So Mei smiles and nods and softly says , Okay , and waits for the woman to realize that it is all right and that she can go . Anna , for her part , considers her mother gone from the moment Mei walks in . She draws Mei into whatever make-believe is absorbing her , and the good-bye she calls when her mother actually walks out the door is so perfunctory that Mei often has to hide a little laugh , and prod her to say " Goodbye , Mommy " again , with a little more spirit . But the woman laughs too , as if it 's not a very important thing , as if she 's not a bit hurt . <p> Although the apartment is small ( something the woman has mentioned more than once , trying , Mei thought , to make her feel somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parents and the one child , and is filled with things that Americans take for granted . And not just the obvious , expected things , the two televisions and three telephones , the handsome furnishings , the computer . Mei notices smaller touches , like the dozens of soaps in a dish in the bathroom , the four kinds of shampoo and three bottles of bubble bath , one of each just for Anna . The walls are crowed with artwork from japan , Europe , the American West , and there are interesting objects displayed in living room cabinets , arranged on hallway shelves , and cluttering the bookcases in Anna 's bedroom , which was once , the mother had explained , her own study and workroom . <p> The book on those cases are amazing in themselves , there are so many , everything from political theory to poetry . One night , while she sat on Anna 's bed reading her a good night book , she found two red-jacked copies of Quotations from Chairman Mao , stacked together on top of a shelf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items - if anyone even wanted them anymore . Such accidental discoveries have made her more curious about the personal lives of Anna 's parents and what their student days were like ( for surely the little red books dated from then ) . But she rarely asks questions of any kind , and she never looks further into their possessions . Snooping is something so foreign to her , she has no word for it . She makes do with the clues that fall from Anna 's mother , who talks as she rushes out and rushes back ; she sees what she sees as she plays all evening with Anna . Curiosity is n't what she is being paid for . <p> The child herself has more toys stocking her narrow room , spilling into the hall and living room and even the bath , than Mei could imagine her possibly playing with all in the same month . But Mei knows that this is simply the American way with children , particularly first-and-onlys . And Anna seems so unspoiled , so genuinely delighted by even the smallest gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper boat - it is n't hard to understand why giving her things would give her parents pleasure . <p> Each birthday and each Christmas , Meo has brought Anna a gift from China , though most had to be bought in Chinatown and were probably Taiwanese . On Fridays , Mei sees her presents displayed on the bookshelves , or finds them in Anna 's orderly toy bins : a traditionally dressed doll , a stuffed panda , an abacus , a wind-up girl on a tricycle . Today is the Friday before Anna 's third birthday , and Mei has brought a brightly wrapped present . Anna thanks her without being prompted and scampers into the living room with the small package . She sits down on a playmat littered with the assorted little characters who live in her plastic dollhouse and eagerly pulls off the ribbons and wrapping paper . <p> " It 's a necklace ! " Anna exclaims , holding up the small string of pale jade beads . " Put it on me ! " <p> Mei is already crouching on the floor beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , a habit from the baby days . Anna seems to like the closeness . When the necklace is securely fastened , she pulls on it . <p> " Do n't pull on the beads , sweetie , " her mother says . " They 're delicate , they can break . " <p> " Okay , " she says easily , then smiles at Mei . " How about Chinese Babies ? ' " Every Friday , she likes to hear the tape of singing Beijing school children that Mei got her for her first birthday . Mei imagines this is the only time it is played . Anna seems to understand it without any translation or explanation . <p> " How about saying thank you to Mei ? " her mother reminds her . <p> " I did already , " Anna complains . But then , she turns and gives Mei a little hug . " Thank you , Mei ! " <p> " You 're welcome , " Mei answers , embarrassed by all the attention . She glances at her watch , wonders why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " What do you think about what 's going on in China ? Have you spoken to your family ? " <p> It is n't the first time the woman had asked about China . But these questions are more pointed , speaking directly to the Situation , as Mei has heard American television news refer to it . <p> " Everybody is , mmmm , unsure what will happen . Students have a lot of ... feeling . But they have no power . No power . " It is hard to express everything everyone has been talking about in few words , to let the woman out of the conversation gracefully . <p> " You mean , there is no way to change things just because people are angry and unhappy with the system ... " the woman offers . <p> " Mmmm ... yes , no way , very difficult . " In spite of herself , Mei wants to make it a bit clearer . " We do n't know ... " She stops , corrects herself . " No one knows which leaders will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal , all depends ... " She smiles self-deprecatingly , shrugs slightly . <p> " It 's very complicated , is n't it , " the woman says , shaking her long auburn curls and sighing as she picks up her black leather satchel . " Well ... I hope it turns out all right . See you later . G'bye , my girl ! " <p> Anna , rearranging some of her little people , grunts and wiggles her behind in farewell . Mei says goodbye , and goes over to the tape deck to find " Chinese Babies " as the front door closes . As always , she hears Anna 's mother lock both locks from the outside . <p> " Do you want your dinner now ? " Mei asks , as Anna 's mother expects her to , though Anna almost always tells her when she is hungry . <p> " Uh-uh , I 'm not finished . Play with me , Mei , " Anna says automatically , attention still focused entirely on her game . <p> Mei bends silently over the tiny figures strewn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them are , but Mei only remembers a few names , those which seem to describe the characters : Big Bird , Cookie Monster . Sometimes Anna asks Mei to do the voices of the figures . And whatever she manages is fine . Anna never squawks " WHAT ? " the way most New Yorkers do when they do n't understand Mei 's use of their language . Anna laughs most deliciously when Mei has someone speak Mandarin . She likes to imitate the sounds with her childish singsong . Her ear is very good . <p> Mei knows that Anna 's mother used to fret about her English , and about her quiet hesitance to speak , constantly encouraging her to talk , talk , talk to the baby Anna , who was a very early talker herself . But the truth is that Anna is equally fine with awkward English , with Chinese , even with silence . She chatters enough for two or three people , fluently , articulately , and what she most often expects is a word or a nod now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , if Anna were n't so nice , Mei might be shamed by the astonishing advances the little girl has made in speaking , compared with her own plodding pace . One reason she likes seeing Anna once a week is that it is such an easy give and take , a place to practice speaking freely . <p> " You know , Mei , I think I need a hat , for the sun , " says Anna , suddenly , squinting dramatically , covering her baby-fine light brown curls with one hand . " It 's very sunny in the park . " <p> Mei gestures toward the hall tree , where Anna 's summer hats are hung . " Which one ? " <p> Anna giggles . " Not those . I 'm too tired of those . I need the Chinese hat , the one you made me . " Mei disappears into Anna 's room , rummages through the dress-up box , returns with a square of Japanese silk . The knotted corners have been undone , leaving little wrinkles in the fabric . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Anna 's small skull . If it were n't for her pale skin and green eyes , she could be a rice farmer 's child . Anna runs as usual to the hall mirror , makes slight adjustments . " How do I look , " she asks . " Gorgeous ? " <p> " Gorgeous , " confirms Mei . Anna rejoins her , sits almost on her feet . <p> " You know what , Mei ? " puts in . <p> " How did you know ? " Anna giggles , rising with Mei , who says simply , " Come have dinner , then we play more . " <p> " Okay , " says Anna amiably . She holds Mei 's hand as they walk into the kitchen . She is still wearing her peasant cap , and she wo n't take it off until her pajamas have to go on over her head . <p> Anna 's dinner is fish sticks and noodles in a red sauce , with peas and carrots on the side , all laid out on a partitioned porcelain plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fork and spoon are thoughtfully set to one side as well . Sometimes Anna 's mother leaves something that Mei guesses she must have cooked herself . But usually she recognizes the kind of things Americans in a rush ( and when are n't they in a rush ? ) turn to : pebbly frozen vegetables revived in boiling water , fish or meat quickly heated in a microwave , sauce from a jar . The noodles , mushy white corkscrews , are probably remnants from some other dinner ; there 's plastic bucket of them sauceless , in case Anna wants more . She is n't big eater ; it probably is n't worth cooking a whole meal just for her . Mei knows that when Anna 's mother and father come home at nine , they order dinner for themselves from a Cuban-Chinese restaurant Anna 's mother has told her about , emphasizing its cheapness , and admitting it 's stronger on Cuban food than on Chinese . <p> Anna begins with the pasta , humming as the pops pieces into her mouth , happily smearing her face with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , sometimes stands nearby , ready if Anna needs any help . In the early days , Anna 's mother pressed Mei to eat - " anything you want " - when Anna did . She always left out a canister of jasmine tea , too , and a special teacup near the pot of hot water on the stove . Eventually , she stopped , apparently realizing that Mei never ate or drank anything at all . <p> Mei is grateful the woman did n't make an issue of it . She does , in fact , occasionally have a glass of water , which she carefully rinses out , dries and puts back on the open shelf of glassware . But she finds nothing appetizing about the food that Anna eats or the assortment she sees in the refrigerator when she is cleaning up . It is true that there are always white cardboard cartons she has learned invariably signify Chinese food . But even the prospect of peeking into these , much less eating from them , makes her slightly queasy . Lucky that she is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't make her more so . It is much better to wait and cook dinner at home for Lu and herself . <p> " Mei , what 's this paper ? " Anna asks in the middle of hummingly picking up peas one by one , and leans over her plate to grab for a ragged piece for newsprint set almost like a placement on the table . But Mei has n't sat down at her place this evening . She retrieves the paper , sees that it is a section of a newspaper 's front page , with a note , for Mei , in the margin . It is another story about the Situation , this time about how some Chinese graduate students in the United States have been raising money for the freedom movement . <p> Anna 's mother mocks her habit of clipping articles for Mei , saying she is sure Mei sources of information about Things At Home are closer to those things than the New York Times or Time or Newsweek are . Nevertheless , she continues to quietly leave fluttering papers for Mei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American articles and openly opinionated essays very interesting , when she has the time to study them , translating roughly for herself . But lately , she does n't feel like being reminded so insistently of how far from home she is . The sad meetings at school with other Beijing graduates , the restrained writing in the Chinese-language papers are more than enough . Fridays are reserved for quietly reading in the university library , and , later , for playing with Anna . She folds the page in half , and pushes it under the napkin holder . Maybe she 'll remember to put it in her purse later . <p> " Is it a story , Mei ? " Anna persists , tilting her head and smiling . There is a charming gap between her two front teeth which her mother , for some reason , is self-conscious about . <p> " Yes , it is a story , " answers Mei . She sits down and shifts the heavy , highbacked chair toward Anna 's highchair . <p> " Is it a story about me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have played since Anna first asked Mei for stories . But now Mei 's answer is different . <p> " No , " she says quietly . " It is a story about me . " <p> Anna does n't really care , so long as it is a story . " Tell it to me , " she commands , pushing away her plate . " I 'm finished . " The carrots have been carefully left behind , and she has n't touched the fish at all . <p> " You eat more , " Mei suggests . " You eat , and I will tell you story . " <p> " Tell me the story about you . " As nice as Anna is , there is always her three-year-old will . It is almost impossible to turn her aside , or distract her , when her mind is set on something . <p> " You eat more , " Mei repeats . " Then I tell . " She smiles in spite of herself as Anna picks up a breaded fish finger and makes a show of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anna says , pushing the whole thing into her little mouth , chewing , chewing , chewing , heroically swallowling . <p> Shaking her own finger , mock-stern , Mei begins . " Once , there was a girl called ... " <p> " Mei ! " Anna shouts . <p> " ... called Mei , and she lived in China , far away . She had a Mama and Papa who work in big bank office , one big sister , one baby brother . " <p> " Was he a teensy , weensy baby ? " Anna inquires . She loves details . <p> " What means ? " Mei asks . <p> " Teensy , weensy , eensy beensy little baby , " Anna explains . <p> " Yes , he is a little baby , before he grow up , " Mei says " So ... Mei is very happy living together with family . They have big house in city , garden all around with tall trees and beautiful flowers . Many colors , perfume in air . Can you smell the flowers ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noisily snuffs a big breath up through her tiny nostrils . " Mmm ... yes I can , Mei ! " she says excitedly . " I smell the flowers ! Are there roses too ? " Roses have been Anna 's favorite flower ever since the roses on her best baby quilt , the one that now hangs in her room over her new grownup bed . <p> " Yes , red roses , " Mei says for the sake of the story . She is n't actually sure any more whether there were roses then , or roses now . " So ... garden Mei 's favorite place , playing with friends , tea parties and other games , watching little brother sleep under trees in carriage . Sometimes she does sleep outside to , summer , so hot in house . " <p> " Do n't you have a fan in your room ? " Anna asks . " I do . Mommy and Daddy do . " <p> " Well ... sleeping outside fun , " Mei smoothly offers . " Mei has fun in her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama in house , eats all good things for dinner ... " she pointedly puts in . Anna giggles , guiltily bites off half of another fish stick , drinks some juice to help it down . She spears two carrot cubes with a pinky nail and holds them up for Mei to admire . <p> " Look , Mei , look what I can do , " she says . " Look ! " Mei does n't understand why Anna is n't using a fork more these says . Sometimes Anna asks for the blue plastic child 's chopsticks Mei picked up for her on a trip to Chinatown . Stabbling the food with the sharpened end of a chopstick is better than this finger business . But it is n't really her business , is it . She hates to encourage it , though . <p> " Do you want to hear story ? " Mei asks . <p> " Yes . But look what I can do , " Anna insists , waggling her little finger in Mei 's face . <p> " Hmmm , " Mei says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and everything fine until one day , something happens : a dragon comes . " <p> " A dragon ! " Anna interrupts . " Where did it come from ? " <p> " No one knows . One day - dragon . It is a really terrible dragon : first thing , burns houses down , pulls up trees and flower gardens , blows up buildings and buses , destroys everything . Many people hurt , some die . Then dragon says , I am the new emperor of China . " <p> " What means an emperor ? " Anna asks . Mei smiles , wonders how far into the weekend Anna 's imitation of her speech extends . " Emperor is ... like king , " Mei explains . <p> " Oh . " <p> " So ... dragon is king over China . Not kill so many people more , but people have no happiness now . They have no flowers , no big house , even children do n't have many toys . Dragon eat all best food , people have only rice . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one main thing : not free . " She pauses , expecting Anna to interrupt with a question . But the girl is gazing at her , her face clear , untroubled . <p> " Dragon makes people work hard , hard , hard , no time to think or talk , or play , or sleep and dream . Not free , means can not do anything unless dragon say . No choice . Free means , do what you want , say what thinking . With dragon , no one can say , I want to be artist instead of factory worker ; can not think , I do n't like this life , I change . But Mei thinks , I am still free , I can do something . " <p> " What can she do ? " asks Anna . <p> A good question . " First ... she must ... go away to island where no dragon can come . In this place , is ... a witch who teaches ... " <p> " A good witch , " Anna clarifies . <p> " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved that Anna gets it . Fairy tale language is actually more of a struggle than academic jargon . " Mei supposed to learn how to fight dragon . Her family do n't want to let her go . Too sad , say goodbye . But then , she finds friend who can go with her . His name Lu . Good friend ; strong , smart , beautiful . Now , not so alone . Mei goes to learn special style dragon fighting . " <p> " But sometimes , still lonely , so far from China . Sometimes , little Mei is homesick , even though home not so good place for Chinese people anymore . " <p> Mei stops . The story has to have a happy ending and this is going somewhere else . Toward the fear and the silence . Still Anna 's face remains so serious , so full of understanding . " Sometimes she thinks , what can one small girl do ? How foolish to pretend one small girl can fight such a big dragon , change everything . But Anna ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah ! " she stage-whispers back . <p> " Mei should be brave , should n't she ? " she asks . " Should she give up , not even trying ? " She raises both hands before her , as if begging for an answer . <p> " No ! " shouts Anna . <p> " That 's right , " says Mei . " Give up , not happy either . Trying , trying and trying : that way better . Someday Mei will sit in garden and be so glad like little children again . " Sitting beside an American child now , she realizes that this is the most she has even talked about herself in English . <p> " Where ? " asks Anna . " Where is the garden ? " <p> " I told you , " Mei reminds her . " My home . China . Far away . " <p> " Are you going now ? " Anna asks , her face worried for the first time . <p> " Oh no , " laughs Mei . " Not now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the table to softly touch the little girl 's cheek with the curve of her small hand . <p> Anna nods , almost satisfied . " Can I see the garden ? " she wants to know . <p> " Maybe someday , " says Mei . " Are you finished now ? What do you want to do after dinner ? " <p> " Play , " answers Anna simply . <p> In the living room , Mei unstacks the jigsaw puzzles from their special toy box and watches as Anna works the newest addition , a fifty-piece farm scene brightly painted in naive style . <p> " Is this like Mei 's garden ? " Anna asks , pointing to the sunflowers flanking bed of asters , poppies , violets , zinnias , all tended by a smiling blonde girl in a checkered scarf and floral-print dress . <p> Mei reaches over and touches a nearly-hidden bush . " Here are the red roses , " she says . <p> At eight , Mei helps Anna into her pajamas , takes the chill off a cup of milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed beside her with the canvas bag of new library books Anna and her mother take out almost every week . Anna 's mother tends to a conscientiously international selection , with stories set in New York far outnumbered by those using Paris , Tokyo , South America , Africa , as backdrops . Sometimes Mei wonders whether the woman knows how much she , Mei , is really reading when she reads for Anna . <p> " Look , Mei , this looks like a dragon ! " Anna cries . Suddenly inspired , she is standing on tiptoes , grasping the edge of a bookshelf , trying to put her hand on the tiny , iron figure of a serpent . <p> " Do n't touch that , Anna , " Mei warns . " That is not one of your toys , is it ? " <p> " It 's a dragon , is n't it ? " Anna cooperatively ceases her effort without abandoning her inspiration . <p> " Maybe it is , " says Mei uncertainly .

Mei watches the father slip the mother some money before he hastily retreats into their bedroom . The woman asks how everything was , expecting nothing but the briefest reassurance , Mei understands . She thanks Mei , hands her two crisp bills , a five and a ten . <p> " I really hope everything will be all right in China , " she says earnestly . <p> " Me too , I hope so . " Mei nods . " Thank you very much , I see you next week ? " <p> Yes , of course , next week , " the woman says , smiling . She holds the door open as Mei quickly steps out .
