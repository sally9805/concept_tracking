Once a summer health haven for the urban upper crust , Mackinac Island now extends its lure past Labor Day for " fudgies " who ca n't bear to call it a season . <p> Mackinac Island residents are accustomed to tourists vowing to move heaven and earth to retire to their remote little piece of paradise . But when a Lansing couple recently announced that they would move their 1887 Victorian home north to accommodate his love for the island and her love for the house , that was going too far  --  25 miles , to be exact . The plan  --  they 're still fine-tuning it  --  is to separate the house into cubes , transport the pieces from the middle of the state to Lake Michigan , move them by barge to the island , and then reassemble the two-story structure on its picturesque lot . Yet to be worked out is the small problem of getting the house from pier to homesite . The only modes of transportation permitted on the island are bicycles and horses . <p> Details , details . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Police here give tickets for reckless driving  --  island talk for two on a bike . UPS deliveries are made by horse-drawn wagon . The cemetery is so exclusive that a body has to own a home or business to qualify for burial . And , although students from around the state arrive by ferry for class trips in the spring , seniors at Mackinac Island Public School ( appropriately called " The Lakers " ) think on a grander scale . This year 's graduating class of four  --  Tom , Heather , Jim , and Melissa  --  opted for Europe in April . <p> Once a health haven for the urban upper crust of Chicago and Detroit , the island still offers R and R to wealthy families who unwind in magnificent Victorian " cottages " on the east and west bluffs . But the destination also is a friendly day trip for " fudgies " who arrive in the morning with cameras and beach towels and leave in the afternoon with sunburned noses and waxed-paper bundles of the gooey stuff . Islanders say that their famed fudge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald Ford as proof . <p> " He was here for less than 24 hours in 1975 , and every second was carefully planned , " recalls David Armour , deputy director of Mackinac State Historic Parks . " The presidential armored limousine was shipped secretly to British Landing on the northwest side of the island and hidden in one of our service buildings in case of an emergency . " As it turned out , the only " emergency " occurred when Ford gave his Secret Service detail the slip and took an unplanned trip downtown for fudge . It seems he had sampled the treat 26 years earlier when he was part of the governor 's honor guard of Eagle Scouts . He was ready for another wedge . <p> Besides the fudge , Mackinac has a fair share of " firsts " and " onlys " that are retold by tour guides who maneuver horses , buggies , and visitors through the compact historic district . Their spiel : The island once comprised America 's second oldest ( to Yellowstone ) national park , but when the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first state park . Also , the eight-mile road that meanders the shoreline in a lazy loop is the nation 's only state highway without motorized traffic . And , of course , Market Street was the fur-trading hub of the Midwest until beaver hats fell from favor in Europe and caused locals to consider tourism as an economy booster . <p> It was a good idea . <p> The " season " that once opened in July and closed in August now stretches from spring to winter . Current hotel managers , shop owners , and tourism mavens have successfully marketed a Memorial Day celebration in May , a lilac festival in June , an annual run around the island in September , fall-color tours in October , and cross-country skiing events in December . These island-wide attractions are supplemented by smaller gatherings , such as a bluegrass festival at family-friendly Mission Point Resort and a Big Band weekend at the grandiose Grand Hotel . Fans of the 1980 motion picture Somewhere in Time arrive each October with hankies in hand to sniffle through another commemorative showing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> True Mackinac buffs prefer their island straight up without the twists . As the number of daily guests dwindles from 10,000 in the summer to a handful by late autumn , innkeepers throw extra logs on the fires and play host to the diehards . <p> " The highlight of our days is walking to the post office for the mail and then stopping by the Mustang Lounge for coffee , " explains one year-rounder . After ferry service shuts down in January , the 500 permanent residents drill holes in frozen Lake Michigan , " plant " their discarded Christmas trees to serve as markers to the weather-obscured mainland , and skim across the ice bridge on their snowmobiles . The roar of gas engines that disturbs the silence is both a rarity and a necessity , assures one resident . " We have no choice , " she says . " Even the horses go south for the winter .

Since the release of the 1980 romantic film Somewhere in Time . the island has been a popular wedding location . As many as 500 couples exchange vows each summer , some choosing the romantic wedding gazebo at Surrey Hills , others opting for an " at-sea " ceremony during the 20-minute ferry ride from the mainland . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Fort Mackinac was built by British soldiers during the American Revolution and served as a sentinel in the Straits of Mackinac for 115 years . Today , visitors trace the footsteps of British and American troops by exploring historic buildings and watching lively demonstrations . <p> By Holly G. Miller <p> GET TO THE POINT <p> Mackinac Island 's reputation as a summer spa once prompted Michigan surgeon H.R. Mills to prescribe a stay on the island for anyone " suffering from overworked brains or muscles .
