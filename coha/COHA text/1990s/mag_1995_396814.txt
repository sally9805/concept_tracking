Having discovered the joys of skiing in South America seven years ago , I now jump at any chance to ski the Andes . During past North American summers , I had been up to my waist in powder in Las Lenas , had whole mountainsides to myself at Valle Nevado , and dropped into smooth slopes of corn snow above Portillo . Yep , I 'm a South American ski junkie , hopelessly addicted to the beauty , thrills , and fun-loving people of the Andean ski season . With the right weather conditions , and Chile offer some of the best advanced skiing in the Hemisphere . The South American seasons are the mirror opposite of ours , with winter starting in June and mid-winter skiing conditions extending into September , before the ski season in October . But I had never had an opportunity to ski Bariloche in Argentina . I had heard stories of a gorgeous take surrounded by enormous peaks , a region that visitors said resembled the Alps  --  not just in the physical sense but in the ambience created by thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard that this was the land where Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had roamed . And I had never realized that Bariloche as in Patagonia , that near-mythical land near the tip of South America . So when mid-September rolled around , I was thrilled to find myself holed up with the Wild ( in our own minds ) Bunch on a night flight to Buenos Aires . Besides myself , there was Lee Carlson , senior travel editor of SKIING , and two friends , Robbo and " Big Jim , " an individual of notable physical presence courted in his youth by the NHL . Butch Cassidy would have been happy to ride with Jim . The original Wild Bunch was trying to escape the heat of the law when they sailed off to South America . Our gang just wanted to escape the hear , period . With the help of Aerolineas Argentinas  --  and a few cocktail  --  we flew our of a stifling heat wave and straight into winter and the promise of snow . The Buenos Aires that greeted Butch and Sundance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . Today , B.A. is a testament to Argentina 's recent " economic miracle . " Twelve years of stable democracy have added a lot of bustle and new construction to B.A. 's long , broad boulevards and pedestrian streets , like Lavalle , which pulses with the music of shops , cinemas , and the most elaborate video arcades this side of Vegas . Arriving at B.A. 's airport in the early morning hours , the new Wild Bunch felt surprisingly fresh . We hopped a taxi to downtown and a comfortable hotel . Half the W.B. went jogging , half took a nap . By early afternoon , we were ready to hit the town . A walk led us into the narrow streets of the historic Old Section . We put our feet up in a sunny square and felt as if we had landed in Europe , without the big time change ( Argentina is one hour ahead of Eastern time ) . By evening , we were on Lavalle , encountering the first in a long series of big meals here in meat-land . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended by three large gauchos , long knives hanging menacingly from their silver-studded belts . The weapons were n't meant for gringos , however , but for poking the sizzling flesh that hung from racks and spits surrounding the flames . Squeezing past the inferno , we took our seats in the middle of a sea of tables and watched the variety of an Argentine asado appear before us  --  plate after plate with cuts and sausages of tender lamb , pork , and beef . Late the next day , we were on the two-hour flight to Bariloche . Thousands of lakes scattered the landscape like broken glass , the land turning drier as we passed over the steppes of Patagonia . The moon rose above a storm battering the Andes . As we descended toward the lights of Bariloche and the dark outline of Lake Nahuel Huapi , the moon 's globe blurred into streaks of falling powder . The movie version of Butch and Sundance 's arrival in South America is surprisingly close to the truth . They even had a Katherine Ross look-alike , Etta Place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashing Dance . Heading south into Patagonia , they discovered a land much like the American West : deserts , frontier tows , and enormous , snowcapped mountains . With Etta holding the shotgun , they made quick work of two Argentine banks , making off with $30,000 ( no small change in 1902 ) . The outlaws fund an enchanting piece of land just south of Bariloche , deposited all $30,000 in the local bank ( Butch quizzing the manager as to the bank 's security ) , and settled down to raise cattle . It was n't until 37 years later , 1939 , that Hans Noble of St. Anton , Austria , arrived in Bariloche and began the creation of South America 's first ski resort . Just out of town , Noble found a tremendous mountain flank . which is now Gran Catedral ski resort . In a region settled by natives of the Alps , the culture of skiing found a true home . Bariloche and its environs grew into South America 's largest ski town  --  population 82,000  --  and a culture more akin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right at the base of the lifts , in the early evening . The Pire-Hue Hotel is a spectacular structure , walls and ceilings of Patagonian cypress and other native woods , all polished to the rich sheen of a hotel in the Alberg . We threw our bags into a two-bedroom apartment and headed for the bar and The Big Bummer . The locals at the bar told us it had been raining and the bottom of the mountain had thin coverage ... at best . We instantly got long faces , until the bartender chimed in  --  " But the top of the mountain is fan-tastic "  --  and we all got happy again and ordered another round . Nevertheless , the morning light did carry with it some anxiety as we looked out our hotel windows to bare ground at Gran Catedral 's low , 3,400-foot base . But on the first chairlift ride , the resort 's 6,800-foot summit appeared out of parting clouds , and beneath the summit tiny dots of skiers ripped down an enormous bowl . We hopped on a second chairlift and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us were surprised by the scope of the place , especially me . Having experienced the vastness of South American resorts like Las Lenas and Valle Nevado , I had been led to believe that the skiing of Bariloche was much smaller : " Beautiful area , but not a lot of terrain " went the conventional wisdom . But here before us was dramatic evidence that ( as usual ) the conventional wisdom was wrong . Spread out before us was a resort at least as big as the average major Western U.S. resort . A long ridgeline , Del Condor , loomed off to our right , 2,500 vertical feet of intermediate fall line . Up to the left , the high Pico Norte peak rippled with volcanic-rock couloirs . And below us an open forest of gullies and glades stretched down to the base area . Best of all , it was snowing , hard . We skated down a traverse and onto a poma lift . Like the large European resorts it resembles , much of Gran Catedral 's uphill capacity comes from surface lifts . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upgrading of the ancient tram to a new 54-passenger version and the addition of a triple or quad chair this year and the planned addition of several high-speed quads and a mountain-long eight-person gondola for ' ' 96 . I found myself happy to ride the poma , however , flexing my boots and transferring weight to see if I could remember how skis work . Since it had only been four months since the end of the previous season , the whole experience was not unfamiliar , just incongruous , part of that dreamlike quality one feels on a journey to the Southern Hemisphere winter . Subtle light at the top of the poma revealed a mini-bowl of undisturbed , spongy snow . We dove in like , well , a wild bunch , hooting and howling . Here it was , only day three of our grand getaway , and we were already getting our knees wet . Lucky for the legs , the storm intensified on the mountain , wind chasing us into a tiny hut that appeared like a specter out of the blizzard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The place was warm and steamy , with a few locals huddled over a wood-burning stove and enticing-looking drinks in the corner . A cook wearing ski boots walked out of the small kitchen . " Donde esta drinka bueno ? " Robbo asked ... or something equally silly . " You look like you need a schnapps , " replied the cook in accented English . " And what about a steak sandwich ? " We were soon comfortable in a corner of Nirvana , surrounded by ' ' 60s rock-and-roll posters and broken snowboards nailed to the walls , the air filled with the sweet smell of seared beef . In the early evening , we rendezvoused in the hotel bar and headed out for a stroll . In a landscape reminiscent of the high New Mexican plateau , the base village 's wood buildings house a variety of European-style restaurants , hotels , and shops . Since dinner was n't scheduled till the usual South American hour of 10 P.M. , there was time to grab a cab and quickly explore the town . Bariloche itself contrasts an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with young Argentine tourists . Our walk revealed stores filled with sweaters and chocolate ( the two local products for which Bariloche is famous ) , bars , restaurants , discos , and three Kodak " Fast Photo " shops on just one block . Dinner was at La Raclette , a tiny restaurant near the middle of the ski village . Raclette is owned by Peter Somweber , a native Austrian and mountain manager for the ski hill . Peter , his wife , Valerie , and their three children all sing and play musical instruments like an Andean Trapp Family . The pungent aroma of melting cheese rose from the hot raclette while we feasted on smoked venison , wild boar , and rich Argentine wine . At the head of the table , Peter hooked up an impressive collection of electronic gadgetry to a large accordion and launched into a stunning evening of entertainment , with singing in three languages and yodeling . Peter 's mastery of instruments extended to spoons , cow bells , a one-inch harmonica , and a 12-foot Swiss alpenhorn . The Austrians in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled out at close to 2 A.M. and polkaed back to the hotel . It was dumping snow and rain horizontally the next morning ; 50-mph winds blew high on the mountain . So we decided to visit one of South America 's true visual icons : Llao Llao ( pronounced " zhou-zhou " ) , an immense resort hotel 16 miles from Bariloche . The drive to the hotel 's spectacular location is a visual reminder of the Swiss Lake District , 10,000-foot peaks towering over Lake Nahuel Huapi 's 60-mile length . Llao Llao is so huge that it hosted the meeting of the Organization of American States in 1957 , including Eisenhower and his entourage . Its formal dining room seats 700 . Now a $30 million renovation has recaptured Llao Llao 's formal glory . By the time we drove back toward Grand Catedral , the storm had moved east and left us a brilliant sky of South American stars . Light at the window had us up early . It was Big Jim 's birthday , and the weather was cooperating with sun on the summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our first expansive view of Lake Nahuel Huapi , twisting like an emerald snake into the core of the Andes . At its best , the snow was wind-blown ; in other spots it had collected into impenetrable muck . But the birthday boy found a ripping route down a trail of smooth pack in the middle of the big bowl , an exhilarating flight , over dips and rolls , that kept us well clear of the scary drifts . Zipping across the mountainside to Condor ridge , we spread our wings down a ribbon of groomed trail toward the lake . Back up Condor 's series of lifts , we decided to try the steep trees leading toward the center of the mountain . Now with a little warm-up under our belts , the compacted snow was easier to negotiate , the skis rebounding quickly from turn to turn with only a few rolling head plants to keep us humble . Another series of lifts led us to the resort 's highest point and an epic view into the Andes . Tiny specks floated toward us out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide for the day . " Condors are coming to celebrate your birthday , Senor Jim . " They circled twice , and Jim had time to hike up a rock pinnacle and get his birthday picture taken with huge snow-covered peaks , the lake , and condors circling overhead . The clouds moved back on the mountain by late afternoon and prevented Pablo 's planned hike to the expert chutes underneath 7,200-foot Pico Norte . We were starving , anyway , so we headed over to the ridgetop restaurant , Refugio Lynch , one of 10 restaurant/huts on Gran Catedral . By the time we had savored schnapps and lunch , there was time left for one last run down the mountain . Pablo , Peter , and the rest of our growing group of friends had something special planned for Big Jim : dinner at El Boliche Viejo . This same building had served some very infamous clients around 1903 . Yep , there they stood in old photos lining the restaurant walls : Butch , Sundance , and Katherine  --  I mean Etta  --  pictured in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general store . The bandit grandfather of the present owner had a " professional relationship " with the Wild Bunch and liked to have them over for drinks and poker . The grandson certainly inherited the family hospitality , serving up an endless selection of grilled meat ( some of mysterious origin ) and a bottomless bottle of wine . The original Wild Bunch would probably have retired in Bariloche , if only Sundance had behaved . But , as described in one account , Dance " became friendly with a rancher 's wife and was caught in her bedroom by her irate husband . " As fast with his gun as " a snake 's tongue , " Sundance winged the rancher and got away without a scratch . But when Butch found out , he knew it was only a matter of time until the wounded rancher brought the law down on their heads . Driving their cattle north , the outlaws abandoned their land and disappeared into the mountains . Our clue to leave Bariloche did not involve gunfire , thank goodness . We had rented a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim saw a tiny cabin pulsing with bright lights and a pounding beat . It could only mean one thing : disco . Jim spun the wheel , punched the accelerator , the car jumped up the hill , and Lee barely had time to shout " watch out " before we skidded to a swerving halt under a poma cable hung at the perfect height for car decapitation . We parked right in the middle of the ski run , cable resting on the hood , and walked the last few feet to the disco . The next morning , we packed the car high with ski bags and took off around Nahuel Huapi 's northeastern shore toward the small ski area of Cerro Bayo and its resort town of Villa La Angostura . As we drove deeper into the Andes , the vegetation closed in on us , strange plants hugging the roadside , Elegant , white coihue trees reached their branches up into red crowns ; reminiscent of African thorn trees . Limited development along the road reminded us that we were in a national park  --  Parque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unique species of trees and animals . We pulled up to our hotel  --  Bahia Manzano  --  in the downpour and darkness . The lobby was warm and exquisitely decorated in rustic yet modern style : Hand-woven tapestries and big-beam ceilings were accented with huge wrought-iron chandeliers hung on thick rope . The next morning the view out of our room was breathtaking . Mist rose off the surface of a perfect , little harbor enclosed by steep mountains . It reminded us of the San Juan Islands or the Adirondacks ( depending on the coastal point of view ) . We savored it over a large brunch and then got our act together to go skiing . The lower trails of Cerro Bayo run down wide swaths of fall line cut out of the forest . The rain had turned to snowflakes by the time we reached mid-mountain . Then , riding a T-bar up toward the resort 's summit , the flakes suddenly turned to sun . Clouds parted and a spectacular vista of lakes and peaks grew out of the mist . There was even a rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untouched snow  --  a pot of powder gold . No , it was not " champagne powder , " more like flat cream soda . But the cork was n't even out of the bottle in North America and here we were dancing turns down an Andean peak , real snow flying off real ski edges into real figure eights . Consistent and steep , we chewed that ridge up and moved north to another one . Another hour of slicing and dicing had our legs begging for lunch . All sorts of folks had shown up at Cerro Bayo with the sun , a young crowd of skiers and boarders attracted , in part , by the resort 's $16 lift ticket . It 's easy to get your money 's worth here ; the view alone is worth the price of admission . We felt as if we had made off with all the skiing loot any outlaw could hope for . The next morning we left the rain of the Andes for a journey through the dry land of the Pampas . As we sped down the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up onto worn leather saddles . It was easy to imagine Butch , Sundance , and Etta driving their cattle north with the gauchos . Historians do n't know where the Wild Bunch crossed the mountains on their way toward Bolivia , but if they had had their choice , I 'm sure it would have been the picturesque pass of San Martin de los Andes . Four hours north of Bariloche , San Martin is the nearest town to the ski resort of Chapelco . It 's a classy little burg with a downtown section hard on the shore of a stunning mountain lake . First-class hotels and a large shopping square were firm evidence of the resort 's popularity with Argentine tourists . The next day dawned a powder morning . We fishtailed the rental beast up the 10-mile dirt road to Chapelco through a green canyon of small primitive estancias tended by the Mapuche Indians native to this region . By the time we reached the resort , there were six inches of fresh stuff on the ground and the promise of more up the mountain . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argentina 's more popular ski areas . The lower mountain is almost an novice and intermediate trails and well-spaced tree skiing . The upper mountain breaks free of the forest in a large bowl of advanced skiing and expert runs . The storm was raging so fiercely during our visit that the top of the mountain was never visible , let alone open ; We had to content ourselves with skiing run after run after run of surprisingly good powder protected in the trees . We were again struck by the beauty of Patagonian forests , this one hung with thick moss like a Louisiana bayou , incongruous in a foot of fresh snow . We decided that the moss looked like the white corpuscles stuck to Raquel Welch in the movie Fantastic Voyage . And then we decided that we were probably missing our wives a little too much . A 10-day trip-seven days of fresh snow . No one wanted the adventure to end ; we had gotten accustomed to piling one peak experience atop another . But we reluctantly returned to Bariloche and the quick flight to Buenos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazed the trails of Patagonia and were coming home to tell about it ( yes , Butch and Sundance did finally meet their fate at the hands of the Bolivian army ) . Of all the skiing I had done in South America , this journey felt the most complete , a stunning combination of terrain , culture , scenic beauty , and fascinating people . The only thing missing from our trip , since we were there in September , had been light , fluffy powder and cold midwinter conditions . But I knew that Bariloche was a place to return to some July or August , with the wife and kids . It 's a spot with something for all of us : mountains , lakes , history , new horizons , and more than a little fun along the way . Destination : South America Getting There There are two gateways to skiing in South America : Buenos Aires in Argentina and Santiago in Chile . The two most common departure cities are New York and Miami ; flights leave in the evening and land in South America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities with history , culture , and good shopping , and many travelers spend a day exploring before heading to the ski areas . To get to the Argentine resorts , you take another flight into the interior , then a shuttle bus to the resort . The major Chilean resorts are easier to reach : You take a shuttle from Santiago to the resorts of Valle Nevado , La Parva , and El Colorado ( 1-1/2-hour drive ) , or Portillo ( three-hour drive ) . Farther south , a plane ride away , are several lesser-known but enchanting resorts such as Termas de Chillan and Villarrica-Pucon ( located on the slopes of a volcano ) . Prices North American tour operators and travel agents offer packages that include airfare , transfers , lodging , meals , and lift tickets . Adventures on Skis ( 800-628-9655 ) , Ski Vacation Planners ( 800-822-6754 ) , and others offer one-week packages ranging from $1,500 to $3,500 , per person .

A Skiable Feast South Americans treat their food with reverence and respect . Meals are ritual events , meant to be lingered over , and the food is usually excellent .
