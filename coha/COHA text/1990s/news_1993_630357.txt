<p> The American people are witnessing another debacle in foreign policy . What was billed as a humanitarian relief effort in Somalia has become another killing field for American soldiers . <p> When American troops were originally dispatched to Somalia , the American people were led to believe that U.S. troops were acting as a uniformed version of the Peace Corps , supplying safe routes for critically needed food to save a starving nation . And the American people , known for their generosity worldwide , believed these noble intentions . <p> Former anti-war activists , including Sen. Paul Simon ( D-Ill. ) , convinced the American people that " these people are hungry for peace and order . . . . Armed conflict is unlikely because there is no sizable military presence . " <p> Instead , the American people should have listened to the late Hubert H. Humphrey , who during the campaign for president in 1968 warned " America should not be the world 's policeman . " <p> Our U.S. troops are now part of an international police effort in Somalia . To complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish a government out of total anarchy in Somalia . This is clearly escalation of a crisis beyond any semblance of its original intent . <p> How many more times must our troops be assaulted by well-orchestrated military missions specifically designed to attack Americans ? How many more of our dead must we see being dragged through the streets by people supposedly " hungry for peace . " <p> I find it reprehensible that a man who ran when his country called him to arms , a man who has no moral right to shed American blood for an unjust cause , should now be putting our sons and daughters in harm 's way . <p> Pull our troops out of Somalia now , President Clinton . <p> James T. Nalepa , La Grange <p> Unhealthy Plan <p> The Clintons ' health plan consists of smoke and mirrors . It accentuates the positive aspects of their health plan , but purposely neglects to mention its downside . They keep stressing that there are 37 million people without health insurance , but they include millions of young healthy people who elect not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and between jobs . Also included are Medicaid recipients who have green cards and Medicare recipients who neglect to purchase supplementary or Medi-gap insurance . <p> The Clintons tout preventive care . They magnanimously offer women over age 50 mammograms every two years and Pap smears every three years . The medical community recommends mammograms and Pap smears once every year . Do the Clintons believe that cancer cells will take a holiday for two or three years by government edict ? <p> With this health plan you can expect to lose your personal relationship with your physician . Those who have been in the military remember the sick call , when you were just another face ; and before you could describe your complaint you were " diagnosed , " given some medicine and rushed out of the dispensary . With the proposed health plan it will be deja vu . Each individual will be issued a health care security card to be presented when medical care is required ; but you wo n't be a patient by name , you will be a patient by number . <p> President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care plan . This is reminiscent of the old road show where the medicine man traveled from town to town attracting town people and farmers with his magic and slight-of-hand tricks to catch their attention , after which he sold them snake oil from the tailgate of his wagon . Sound familiar ? <p> B. B. Neuchiller , M. D. , <p> Woodstock <p> Overtaxed <p> I am one of four partners in a small restaurant with a seating capacity of 128 and about 35 employees . Since President Clinton is stuffing his wife 's health care plan down our throats , I would like everyone to know my plan . Since small businesses are the target of several neighborhood and political organizations seeking donations we have given our plan a title that is simple but to the point . It is called Survival in the Midwest . <p> Several organizations already have gotten our message because when they ask for donations I simply say , " I can not be a part of your function because Daley and Edgar have buried us in taxes , and with Clinton 's health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in business two or three years down the road . " I tell the organization my name and make them promise to give my reasons for my nonparticipation to their superiors because the blame belongs to Daley , Edgar and Clinton . <p> We will be donating two-thirds less food to the area schools . There no longer will be senior citizen discounts . And finally , the real hurt is denying a homeless person a sandwich when he comes to our back door begging for food . I feel ashamed and guilty for doing this , but the shame really belongs to our local , state and federal officials who will never feel the guilt because the guilt remains with the people who voted for them . <p> So hold your heads up and walk proud , small-business people ! Give the real reasons for not being able to afford things . Tell the poor and the hungry you would be able to help them if only our government would just keep their hands in their own pockets and out of ours . <p> Victoria Lia , Near North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois Department of Corrections wants a new $ 60 million prison . The additional payroll will be $ 11 million . Who knows how much the utilities and other operations will cost . <p> I find it amazing that we , the financially overstressed taxpayers can pay to put up criminals , who care nothing for themselves or anyone else , while we deny the children of Chicago an education . <p> When these children go a few more years without adequate educations , we will need several new prisons . <p> Gloria Picchetti , Lake View <p> Too Many Lawyers <p> I have lost count of the number of times indignant voters have swept the Republicans and/or Democrats from power in a vain effort to effect meaningful reforms . The problem is the elitist tax-and-spend , pork-barrel , special-interest mentality persists , and Congress is perpetually embroiled in scandal . <p> Is it possible that it is not the Republicans and/or Democrats that are the problem ? Regardless of which political party is in power , the lawyers maintain a majority in Congress . <p> Not only is the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infamous ( political action committees ) , they control the presidency ( Bill Clinton ) , the Congress ( 62 percent of the Senate and 40 percent of the House are lawyers ) , and they infest the courts like maggots on road kill . Our government is being run by a special-interest group ! <p> Forget the political parties ! If " we the people " are ever going to take back America we are going to rip it from the claws of the legal profession . Throw the lawyers out ! <p> Karen G. Chessman , Sherrard <p> Support Sox <p> I 've been a White Sox fan all my life . For me the best of all worlds would have been to have Bill Veeck as owner and still watch the team play in that grand old park , but changes happen and life goes on . <p> One thing that does n't change is my love for the Sox . That 's why I take exception to the Sept. 30 letters about Jerry Reinsdorf and the stadium . If disliking Reinsdorf and hating the stadium keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your loss . If this Sox team is n't enough to excite you , I do n't believe you are fans . <p> Remember the past but enjoy the moment . <p> Genevieve Weissensel , <p> Bridgeport <p> Big Mac Crisis <p> I never realized how critical the Boris Yeltsin situation was until I read that three McDonald 's Restaurant in Moscow were closed ( " McDonald 's , Baxter Shut Down in Moscow , " news story , Oct. 5 ) . <p> Sam J. Schneider , <p> Irving Park @x IT APPEARED IN THE APRIL 1 EDITION , but otherwise there was no reason to think David Leonhardt 's New York Times column was a joke . It was , however , a shock ; In the summer of 1933 , just as they will do on Thursday , heads of government and their finance ministers met in London to talk about a global economic crisis . They accomplished little and went home to battle the crisis in their own ways . More than any other country , Germany- Nazi Germany- then set out on a serious stimulus program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autobahn , put up stadiums for the 1936 Berlin Olympics and built monuments to the Nazi Party across Munich and Berlin . The economic benefits of this vast works program never flowed to most workers , because fascism does n't look kindly on collective bargaining . But Germany did escape the Great Depression faster than other countries . An obvious rejoinder is that Germany also began mobilizing for war " faster than other countries . " But Leonhardt saw a positive lesson in the Nazi experience : " Stimulus works . " This argument is remarkable not because of its merit or lack thereof , but because it appeared in print at all . Not long ago it was considered terribly insensitive to praise anything about the Nazi regime . To do so was seen as countenancing or even denying the Holocaust . Leonhardt , well aware of this erstwhile taboo , opened his column by acknowledging that his analogy was " uncomfortable " and " a little distracting . " Later he observed that " no sane person enjoys mixing nuance and Nazis " - not that this stopped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrage . One ought to be able to take for granted that the Holocaust was a singular evil while considering other aspects of the Nazi regime in a detached manner . But the recent writings of a colleague of Leonhardt 's cast a more troubling light on the Times 's changing attitudes toward Nazism . Roger Cohen , who writes for the Times op-ed page , has produced a series of apologias for the Islamic Republic of Iran- a regime whose rulers do deny the Holocaust while at the same time proclaiming their ambition to repeat it . In 2005 Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , infamously said that Israel " must be wiped out from the map of the world . " To be sure , Cohen disapproves of such threats . But he disapproves far more strongly of those who take them seriously . In February , Cohen visited Iran , where he interviewed a handful of Jewish citizens . ( Iran 's Jewish population is estimated at 25,000 , down 75 percent since the 1979 Islamic revolution . ) He found that Iran 's Jews lead a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ayatollahs ' rule . A synagogue in Iran 's third-largest city displayed a banner reading " Congratulations on the 30th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution from the Jewish community of Esfahan . " One Iranian Jew told Cohen he believes Israel is " criminal . " Although Cohen is probably in no danger of winning a Pulitzer , this performance was worthy of Walter Duranty , the notorious Times correspondent whose dispatches from 1930s Moscow included such classics as " Russians Hungry , but Not Starving , " " Red Army Is Held No Menace to Peace , " and " Stalinism Solving Minorities Problem . " The Cohen column prompted much fierce and devastating commentary ( including from my column on the Wall Street Journal 's website ) . That criticism got under Cohen 's skin , and he devoted a second column , in early March , to answering it . Cohen was particularly irked by " American Jews unable to resist some analogy between Iran and Nazi Germany . " Ordinarily , a comparison to Nazi Germany is a crude way of denouncing an opponent or his position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great orator , too . Canada uses the metric system ; Nazi Germany used the metric system , too . This is almost always a logical fallacy , known informally as the argumentum reductio ad Hitlerum : falsely imputing evil to one 's opponent by means of an irrelevant Nazi comparison . Yet if ever such an analogy is appropriate , it is in this case . Iran 's rulers not only have expressed the desire to exterminate Israel 's six million Jews , but they are also seeking the means to do so in the form of a nuclear weapon . Cohen evaded this obvious point . Instead he argued that " Iran 's Islamic Republic is no Third Reich redux " because " Iran has not waged an expansionary war in more than two centuries , " because Iran 's regime does not " require the complete subservience of the individual to the state , " and even because the regime does not operate with " trains-on-time Fascist efficiency . " This is the precise inverse of the usual reductio ad Hitlerum . Cohen is falsely diminishing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi Germany . His observation that Iran lacks " Fascist efficiency " is especially telling in this regard , and it makes Leonhardt 's praise for such efficiency seem all the creepier . Iran 's inefficiency not only is morally irrelevant but has diminishing practical importance . The possession of nuclear weapons makes it possible to commit murder on a Hitlerian scale without anything approaching Germanic competence . IN AN APRIL COLUMN , Cohen finally addressed the Iranian nuclear threat- by dismissing it as an Israeli fabrication . Previous Israeli leaders predicted that Iran would acquire the bomb by 1999 or 2004 , and this did not happen . Therefore , Cohen reasoned , Israel is " crying wolf . " Never mind that the last time the boy in the fable cries wolf , there is a wolf . Never mind , either , that the U.S. government ( under Presidents Clinton and Obama as well as Bush ) , America 's European allies , the International Atomic Energy Agency , and to some extent the governments of Russia , China , and some Arab countries have all taken Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fool everyone except Roger Cohen into believing a threat they know is phony . But if the Israelis are lying when they say Iran is a threat to them , the Iranians are telling the same lie when they issue threats against Israel . Why ? According to Cohen , Iran 's rulers are motivated by a concern for peace , human rights , and nonproliferation . I am not kidding . He actually published the following words : One way to look at Iran 's scurrilous anti-Israel tirades is as a provocation to focus people on Israel 's bomb , its 41-year occupation of the West Bank , its Hamas denial , its repetitive use of overwhelming force . Israel , Cohen claims , is motivated not by an aversion to being obliterated but merely by a cynical desire " to lock in American support and avoid any disadvantageous change in the Middle Eastern balance of power . " America should say no , Cohen asserts , because " Israeli hegemony is proving a kind of slavery . " That statement seemed especially ugly , and a Google search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial by Julius Streicher titled " The Way to Slavery , " which declared that " what one calls democracy today is concealed Jewish domination . " Of course the Times is not the Strmer , and Cohen is no Streicher . The latter was actively promoting evil ; the former , one must assume , is fatuously trying to explain it away . But Cohen 's faint echo of the rhetoric that led to the Holocaust suggests that more respect for postwar taboos would be good for the Times 's moral hygiene .
