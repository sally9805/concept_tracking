Singer Iglesias ' first English-language album is a smooth union of Latin-tinged songcraft and mainstream pop . O.K. , by now this strategy is a little familiar , but Enrique , the son of Julio , seems well positioned for success . High-profile duet ? Check . On the ballad Could I Have This Kiss Forever , Iglesias pairs up with Whitney Houston . Tasteful cover ? Check . Iglesias turns in a smart rendition of the Bruce Springsteen ballad Sad Eyes ( and give him extra points for picking one of the Boss 's more obscure songs ) . Overall , the CD is a bit weepy , but two upbeat numbers , Rhythm Divine and Bailamos , add some much needed rhythmic joy between the tears . <P>  --  C.J.F.
