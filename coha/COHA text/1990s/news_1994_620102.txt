<p> Testing , testing . Can you hear me , foodies ? There 's a new high-profile restaurant you have n't tried . <p> Sorry for the interruption , but apparently there 's been a serious breakdown in the FLN ( Food Lovers Network ) . Charles Solomon , who wowed folks with his refined food at Geordy 's , opened the Heights two months ago , and the restaurant still is as quiet as a library . <p> Everything about this Presidio Heights restaurant indicates a winning combination : the high-profile pedigree of the chef ; the smooth , polished service ; and the pretty surroundings . <p> Solomon , with his wife and partners , took over Le Castel , one of the city 's most enduring classic French restaurants , and added a much-needed dash of fresh air . <p> Diners first see large baskets of apples when they step inside . There 's a dining room on one side , a kitchen tucked behind a small window on the other , and a hallway leading to two more dining rooms . <p> The white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clean , warm look . Chairs have been cleverly slip-covered with muted-green fabric and a black-and-white print emblazoned with pictures of artichokes , squash and other vegetables . It all adds a big dose of chic to the room . ( Waiters wear vests in the same fabric . ) <p> A CLEAN , TAILORED FEEL <p> The simply dressed rooms are completed with rustic buffets or tables , highlighted with arrangements of fresh flowers . Large picture windows in front open to the street ; the windows in back overlook a newly installed garden . The clean , tailored feel is well-suited to Solomon 's unique style : sometimes subtle , sometimes explosive . <p> The appetizers we had on one visit were a good example of this diversity . For one dish , Solomon sliced coins of scallops ( $ 10 ) and added a hot , delicately flavored broth and perfect sprigs of herbs . His eclectic , brash California persona emerged with another dish : sweet , spicy white gulf shrimp ( $ 9 ) , wrapped in zucchini , grilled and served on a pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisply seared medallion of salmon ( $ 8 ) was surrounded by fava beans and an inspired bouillabaisse-style broth , reflecting his French sensibilities . <p> Few chefs are able to pull off so many styles with such finesse . Solomon changes his menu completely each week , featuring five appetizers ranging in price from $ 8 to $ 10 , and an equal number of main courses from $ 17 to $ 23 . On my visits , only one dish appeared twice : braised organic vegetables ( $ 9 ) , which included baby carrots , fava beans , peas and fennel in a light tomato broth flecked with basil . <p> Solomon also creates a weekly six- course " Market Menu " for $ 50 . Of the meals I had , this was the biggest disappointment . Solomon 's talent is evident throughout  --  he 's a wonderful chef  --  but it seemed expensive in comparison to the a la carte menu , and the dishes seemed too much alike : crab-stuffed tortellini with lobster sauce swirled with horseradish , giving a bit of zing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crayfish that seemed redundant with the preceding pasta course ; salmon on couscous surrounded by a sweet carrot broth ; lobster with cabbage and a meat-based stock ; squab , presented a bit too rare , on a bed of soft polenta surrounded by another meat broth . <p> WELL-CRAFTED MENU <p> The a la carte menu , on the other hand , is so well-crafted that any of the dishes could win a devoted following . The most brilliant combination was the Maine lobster ( $ 22 ) . Most Western chefs try to dress up this crustacean with cream sauces and other elegant , refined accompaniments , when in fact it goes best with rustic flavors . <p> Solomon places the lobster atop braised savoy cabbage , with a pile of chanterelles off to the side and a pool of pork stock laced with sage . All the earthy ingredients conspired to bring out the sweetness in the lobster . <p> That does n't mean that things are perfect ; on one visit , three of the courses were woefully lacking in salt , while the sauces contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring elements together , the overseasoned sauces overwhelmed the underseasoned main ingredient . <p> For example , our meal began with a braised chunk of albacore , topped with fine strings of carrots and squash , surrounded by a spicy broth perfumed with soy , vinegar and tomato puree . We tasted the sauce . We tasted the fish , but they did n't come together . It would also have helped if a bit of the sauce had been splashed over the fish . <p> Skate was sauteed and presented on dices of summer squash and barely sweet Empire apples , all moistened with an intense tomato caper sauce ; we noted a flavor gap because the fish was undersalted . <p> When we sprinkled salt on the local rock cod and drizzled on a bit of mussel saffron sauce , softened with aioli , the flavors exploded , whereas before , the fish had been lost in a sea of warring flavors . <p> It may seem picky , and the flaw is minor , but Solomon constructs his dishes so the flavors come together like a symphony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's noticeable . <p> Desserts ( all $ 6 ) can be just as exacting . The gratin of huckleberries was actually a sweet meringue with a layer of these purple pearls sandwiched between , topped with a browned crust . His Financier , a moist , chunky almond cake , can win a dessert contest easily . Seductively warm and moist , it will be devour ed no matter how full you are . <p> The warm chocolate cake , a popular holdover from Geordy 's , is rich and moist , surrounded by ice cream . Solomon is a true master of ice cream and sorbets : a bitter-tinged chocolate sorbet , maple syrup or hazelnut praline . One night he presented three scoops of rich huckleberry ice cream on a lemon tart . <p> In addition , each meal begins with bite-size appetizers and ends with a plate of tiny tarts and cookies , then delicious house- made chocolates . <p> All considered , the price often is less than you 'd pay for restaurants with half as much style and passion for the craft of cooking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiters are adept at predicting the mood of the table . At times , they seem a bit self-conscious , perhaps because they do n't have a lot to do . But they always have a casual professionalism that strikes the right balance . <p> So why are n't people flocking to the Heights ? Are we so used to restaurants as concert halls that we ca n't tolerate a space where we can actually talk to our companions ? Solomon 's restaurant adds a new dimension to dining in San Francisco . The food is as serious as Masa 's fare , but the feel is casual and the prices fair . Let 's hope it 's a temporary communications breakdown , and that the Food Lovers Network will soon be back on line . <p> WINE LIST NEEDS MORE DEPTH <p> Given the high caliber of the food , the wine list at the Heights is weak . With about 30 wines , it does n't have the range or depth of Charles Solomon 's food . <p> However , it 's obvious that the list , whose oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white wines start at $ 16 and reds at $ 20 . Generally , the markup is just over double , which is good , considering the size of the restaurant and the labor-intensive dishes on the menu . <p> The best all-purpose wines are the 1992 Markham Merlot ( $ 28 ) and the 1992 Acacia Pinot Noir ( $ 25 ) . The 1991 Chateau Montelena Chardonnay ( $ 35 ) , though expensive , is a good deal ; the 1992 Robert Mondavi Coastal Chardonnay ( $ 20 ) is a fine choice for the budget-conscious . <p> Because Solomon 's food can range from subtle to bold , the best bet might be to go with one of the seven wines by the glass , all well-priced from $ 4 to $ 6 . <p> * Michael Bauer <p> THE HEIGHTS <p> 3235 Sacramento ( near Presidio ) <p> ( 415 ) 474-8890 <p> Open for dinner 5:30-10 p.m .
