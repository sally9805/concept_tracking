While much of the magazine-publishing business has been hit hard by the recession , one new publication is off to a smashing start . The Quayle Quarterly has watched its circulation leap eightfold in just a year . The Connecticut-based newsletter , dedicated to keeping " a watchful eye on the vice presidency , " has become required reading for 16,000 political junkies . Co-founder Deborah Werksman insists that her magazine treats its subject fairly , and attributes its success to the " high level of civic anxiety " + about the man who could be President . <P> Quayle 's handlers apparently take the journal seriously as well . When Werksman appeared on the Phil Donahue show , G.O.P. mediameister Roger Ailes and vice-presidential spokesman David Beckwith were on hand to defend their man as a heavyweight . Letters to the editor run both pro ( " He 's doing the best he can do with what God gave him " ) and con ( " a yuppie Frankenstein " ) .                @ @ @ @ @
