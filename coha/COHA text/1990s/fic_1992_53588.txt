Often we receive grace without knowing it , and often we do not know it because when grace comes we are already joyful or resilient or serene , or in another good state that grace brings . Sometimes we are impassioned . For five years my first wife and I practiced the rhythm method of birth control . I was in the Marines then . We wanted several children and were trying to have them two years apart . They were born in August of 1958 , September of 1959 , November of 1960 , and February of 1963 . <p> Twice in those years my wife and I made love when we knew she was ovulating . Once was on Christmas Eve in 1958 , while visiting her sister in Ohio , and she conceived our second child . The next time was in California , at Camp Pendleton , one morning before I went to work . We had been married less than two years , and our little girl and baby boy were sleeping ; I was in uniform and waiting for the car pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar told us she was ovulating . Suddenly , still clothed save for our legs and loins , we were making love . She did not conceive . But we had to wait a long time to know that , or what then seemed a long time . Making love with her that morning , I knew fully who I was , where I was , what I was doing ; and I felt that she and I , in one another 's arms , were at the edge of the universe . <p> Years later I felt this with another woman ; but it had nothing to do with conception , and I was frightened and sad , for I was no longer with my wife . Yet my flesh remembered her , as my flesh now remembers walking ; and , while the woman and I made love , I knew that as dear as she was to me , my flesh and spirit had gone too far , spun into space by the centrifugal force of my first love for my first wife . Motion from that spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years . But on that morning in southern California surely grace flowed between us , as we flung away certainty , and said Yes to the unknown , out at the edge of light , where it ends , or becomes more brilliant . <p> <p> By ANDRE DUBUS <p>
