Border-friendly shrubs for flower , fruit , and leaf <p> Some years ago , a friend called to say she would be stopping by with gardening friends from Europe . At the time , the garden was very new and raw , the winter had been the worst in a century , and my feelings were distinctly mixed . Suppressing the urge to drape the entire yard in sheets , I greeted my guests as calmly as I could and began the tour . I need not have worried , for not only were they kind about young gardens , they were captivated by the native flora of the Northwest . <p> My visitors were especially taken with a tall shrub trimmed with burgundy buds that promised large , complicated leaves . I was delighted by their interest , for this handsome native , the western red elderberry ( Sambucus callicarpa ) , is locally considered a trash plant . Now when I am asked why I allow this weed in my garden , I smugly reply that it has European approval . Not surprisingly , this information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dawning respect as visitors acknowledge the elder 's charms . <p> In all , there are over half a dozen native American elders , joined worldwide by nearly 20 other species , hailing primarily from Europe and Asia . Most have large and striking compound leaves , generally pinnate and frequently toothed . Their whiskery little white flowers appear in spring and are usually borne in flat terminal cymes , broad corymbs , or occasionally in panicles . They are followed in summer by clusters of berries in red , blue , or black , but sometimes white or yellow . <p> Like many of their relatives in the honeysuckle family ( Caprifoliaceae ) , the North American elders are easy to grow well . Bird-sown volunteers of one or another of the clan appear in city lots and suburban yards as well as in their natural habitats of wood and meadow . My backyard plant is confined to the maritime Pacific Northwest , but my blue elder ( S. caerulea ) , an even larger beauty with frosted blue fruits , ranges all along the Pacific Coast , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern seaboard from Nova Scotia to Florida and inland as far as the Rocky Mountains . <p> Wherever elders grow , the berries have been used for both cooking and medicine . Some species have been used to make ink or dye as well . Certain fruiting varieties , such as S. canadensis , S. caerulea , and S. nigra , yield fruit for pies , jams , sauces , and wine . Though birds seem to find them palatable and wholesome , certain elderberries are said to be poisonous , so it 's best to check a reliable reference ( such as a hospital-based poison-control department ) before eating them . <p> Fast-growing and tolerant of a wide range of conditions , elders are excellent shrubs for young gardens , where they quickly provide screening and anchoring bulk . Some garden forms are pretty but coarse , and best suited to wild or naturalistic gardens . Many , however , are elegant creatures that lend themselves to painterly plant compositions . Several species sucker aggressively , but most garden forms are more mannerly , and a few , especially those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flourish . <p> Although most elders tend to be large shrubs or small trees , all are easily held to moderate size by an annual hard pruning in late winter . Where more height is wanted , leave a woody framework some three to five feet high , from which each year 's new growth can extend another yard or so . This gives the lankiest elders much-needed guidance and also results in larger , showier foliage . While elders are relatively pest-free , they are susceptible to the elder borer , whose cream-colored , inch-long larvae can came a branch or a stem to die back unexpectedly . If this is the case , simply cut out the deadwood and extract and kill the larvae . <p> In recent years , collectors have reintroduced from England several attractive forms of sweet elder to these shores . Sweet elders grow happily in average garden conditions , preferring light shade , deep soils , and ample moisture where summers are hot . With its ivory flowers and dusky , plum-colored fruits , the species , S. canadensis ( USDA Zone 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its several named forms are more appropriate for the typical garden setting . ' Acutiloba ' , for example , is compact and rather slow growing ( for an elder ) , with slim , arching branches dressed in narrowly divided leaves , and creamy flowers followed by maroon berries . Densely clothed yet light in texture , it contrasts excitingly with shield-leaved grapevine ( Vitis coignetiae ) , ruffled false cypress ( Chamaecyparis obtusa ) , and towering American sunflower ( Rudbeckia maxima ) . ' Aurea ' is larger and more vigorous , with simple , tapering leaves of muted gold that set off its clusters of dark red fruits . In my garden , this elder rises like a small tree above a chalky yellow broom ( Cytisus xpraecox ) , whose blossoms echo the bright elder foliage in spring . Later , sea-blue Clematis ' Ramona ' creates a festive contrast , which is heightened by swirling mounds of Carex elata ' Aurea ' and citrus-yellow Welsh poppies ( Meconopsis cambrica ) . <p> For sheer magnificence , there is also strapping S.c . ' Maxima ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ) that are often divided into 11 parts rather than the usual seven . Its tremendous flower heads are often more than a foot across , the crew my blossoms held on pinkish-purple stems that remain attractive long after flower and fruit are gone . This elder can stand alone in a parklike setting or mingle with equally powerful shrubs , such as pagoda bush ( Leycesteria formosa ) , at the back of the border . <p> Other American elders are less common in gardens , though red elder ( S. pubens ; Zones 4-6 ; 12-25 ft. ) is occasionally grown in shady wild gardens , most often in a form with colorful fruit , such as the white-berried ' Leucocarpa ' or the butterscotch-colored ' Xanthocarpa ' . Tough and drought tolerant , this handsome native is found from the eastern shores to the Rockies . Its cousin , Pacific Coast red elder ( S. callicarpa ; Zones 8-9 ; to 20 ft. ) , is almost never grown deliberately , though the fat red fruits are splendidly showy . In contrast , the European red elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasts several popular garden forms . Their young foliage is stained with winy red , and the ivory flowers , clustered in loose panicles , give way to scarlet berries . Gilded S. r . ' Aurea ' needs the backing of dark rhododendrons or viburnums to play up its gleaming gold foliage , while the fluffy lemon-and-lime leaves of ' Plumosa Aurea ' appear to best advantage against a plain backdrop of blue spruce or somber yew . <p> European red elder also offers unmatched textural delights in the soft green , deeply fringed ' Laciniata ' and the finer textured , needlelike ' Tenuifolia ' , both of which may be pleached or woven into an arched walkway . ' Plumosa ' , with leaves like billowing ostrich feathers , provides light relief for heavy rhododendrons and sternly sheared hedges . Though the golden forms of S. racemosa scorch in full sun if their roots become dry , the others tolerate ordinary soils in full sun or partial shade . <p> Rampant where well suited , European black elder ( S. nigra ; Zone 5 ; 10-20 ft. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigor and larger , more colorful foliage . While some of its numerous forms are splendid creatures , others are merely curious . The prized ' Pulverulenta ' falls into the latter category , for though its heavily frosted new growth glimmers enticingly , this shrub peaks in early summer , lapsing quickly into a frumpy middle age . Wiry ' Laciniata ' , on the other hand , belongs in the splendid category . This one may become a small tree in favored climates , but is more often a medium-size multi-trunked shrub , always distinctive for its finely dissected foliage and broad heads of creamy flowers . Its ebullience of form and delicacy of leaf provide a counterpoint to bold-leaved hydrangeas and heavy evergreens . Then there is the smaller ( rarely over six feet ) and even more cobwebby ' Heterophylla ' , a slow grower that is too weak to produce the typical flowers or berries . Shy and retiring , it needs moist soil enriched with compost or aged manure and some shade to encourage steady growth . It partners beautifully with spurge laurel ( Daphne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Helleborus foetidus . <p> For color , purple elder ( S. nigra ' Purpurea ' ; Zone 5 ; 10-20 ft. ) is a favorite with gardeners and flower arrangers . ( Recently , all dusky forms of S. nigra have been lumped together as S. porphyrophylla , and the form widely sold as ' Purpurea ' is now properly called ' Guincho Purple ' . ) This elder is a smasher of a shrub , its large , dark leaves the perfect foil for its own gentle pink flowers as well as for dwarf blue spruce , red barberry , and dazzling red daylilies . Purple elder also lends pizzazz to pink caryopteris , rose and lavender daylilies , lavender roses , and silvery artemisias . <p> ' Aureomarginata ' , a variegated black elder with leaves neatly edged in bright yellow , is another colorful option , and a natural in blue-yellow-and-white schemes . In my garden it rises like a gilded shower between the pale yellow peony ' Prairie Moon ' and blue lacecap hydrangeas , their arms laced with ' Blue Bird ' clematis and underplanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white weeping birch , white-edged S. n . ' Marginata ' consorts delightfully with ' Lanarth White ' hydrangeas , a white meadow rue , and blue and white forms of Geranium pratense . <p> Arranged in lovely vignettes such as these , shrubby elders grace the garden from late spring well into fall . When groomed and surrounded by select companions , nobody will question why these plants are in the garden . Their strong and long-lasting contributions are delightfully obvious . <p> Ann Lovejoy wrote about verbascums in the August/September 1995 issue of this magazine . <p> For sources of plants mentioned in this article , turn to page 82 . <p> ILLUSTRATION : Above : Sambucus canadensis . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Right : The vigorous Sambucus nigra ' Laciniata ' , which can attain the size of a small tree , boasts delicate , feathery foliage and broad clusters of ivory-colored flowers . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Left : The bright foliage of Sambucus racemosa ' Plumosa Aurea ' finds a perfect foil in Cotinus coggygria .
