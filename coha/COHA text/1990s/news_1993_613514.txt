<p> On a perfect day for a trip to the country - blue skies , a tinge of pre-autumn crispness in the air - Ken Cook is driving north from Atlanta on I-85 , chatting along the way . <p> Mixed in with observations on the remarkable - and perhaps profitable - show of force against speeders in Jackson County is a lot of talk about the weather . Not surprising , since Cook is the longtime weatherman for WAGA/Channel 5 , appearing on newscasts at 5 , 6 and 11 p.m . <p> But Cook 's almost quarter century in the weather-guessing profession is not the only reason for his animated references to fronts , latitude and precipitation probability . <p> An increasingly compelling reason for keeping a sharp weather eye is the family flower farm , three miles from Homer , about 80 miles northeast of Atlanta . There , Cook , his wife , Susie , and their daughters , Barbara and Kim , grow , cut and sell a colorful assortment of old-time blossoms , competing with growers from Latin America and the western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cook does have a certain advantage - to the extent that insider information is useful when trying to determine what Georgia 's weather will do next . From Atlanta , he can spot something on radar , then alert his family at the farm . <p> Says Susie Cook : " He 's called and told us , ' Cut like heck because this is it - you only have two or three hours ; we 've got a front moving in . ' Or , ' Keep watering because we 're not going to get any water for two weeks . ' " How 're they doing ? <p> Working hard , having fun and approaching the time of profit . ( They expect to gross $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 this year . ) <p> Earth work comes naturally to Cook , who celebrates his 46th birthday today . He and his brothers , Doug and Jerome , were young " farmhands " in his native San Antonio , helping his parents grow tuberoses , marigolds and cockscombs on their three-acre spread . In returning to farming while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Agriculture and meteorology are pretty closely intertwined , " Cook says , noting how profoundly growers are at the mercy of the weather . " I 've always had a backyard garden wherever we 've lived , but now , doing some real farming , I do have a greater appreciation about the need for rain . " <p> Rolling along the highway , the meteorologist explains that a long , dry summer in some ways is not surprising , as " most areas around the world in our latitude are desert . " <p> With the ocean to the east and the gulf to the south , Georgia has a " fairly moist climate , " he says , " but it happens that at certain times , our climate can act very arid . " <p> Even so , during TV chit-chat , historically it has n't been unusual to hear a television anchor whining that rain is going to spoil a weekend . <p> Nowadays , however , anchors " realize that we need to have some rain , " Cook says . <p> Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family has made about 10 acres bloom in Banks County . <p> Entering the Cook farm is like approaching a giant Grandma 's yard , with acres of rainbow-colored zinnias , cockscombs , sunflowers , tuberoses , peonies , dahlias - 50 varieties of flowers in all , harvested from May to October . Butterflies flit among the blooms , and a pleasing mix of scents wafts . <p> What they do n't grow are roses and carnations because , Cook says , " the market is totally sewn up , mostly by Central and South America . " <p> This year , the Cooks calculate they planted almost six miles of annual seeds , two miles more than last year . And they sell practically everything they grow - 176,000 stems last year . <p> Perhaps the owners of Georgia 's largest " mom and pop " flower farm , the Cooks , who sell to wholesalers , have developed a good reputation in the seven years they 've been in business . <p> " They 're great , " says Dan O'Brien , a salesman at Metro Wholesale Florists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> At Gresham 's Florist of Atlanta , owner Dottie Scotti says she prefers buying the locally grown flowers because they are fresher than nonlocals , having traveled a shorter distance . <p> Also , said several flower experts , local growers are more responsive to needs and problems than growers from afar . <p> The Cooks say they hear that people are asking for their flowers by name and that some florists leave on the plastic " Ken Cook 's Flowers " bands . And Scotti says when she sells Cook 's flowers , she often tells customers : " These were grown by Ken Cook , the weatherman . " <p> Such talk is , of course , music to Cook 's ears . But it has n't come easy . <p> A self-described " city slicker " ( he also can take and make a joke about his hair , calling it " hurricane resistant " ) when he started working the flower farm in 1986 , Cook had to deal with , among other problems , rock-hard Georgia clay , the vagaries of the weather and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on a tractor when I was 10 years old , " he says , but notes that in San Antonio , the terrain was flat . <p> One tractor incident sums up the trouble he 's seen and the help he 's gotten from neighbors . <p> " One time I was driving across the top of my septic tank , " Cook recalls , " and one of the concrete blocks cracked . One of my wheels fell in . Thank God , the whole thing did n't fall in . " Rescued by a neighbor , Cook emerged from the close call smelling like a tuberose . <p> " We really have some good neighbors , " he says . <p> One of them , L.T. Moon , a cattle farmer , returns the compliment . " Ken 's really a good guy , " he says . " He 's really worked his butt off . " Seeing him " get hung " while riding the tractor " scared me a lot of times , but he 's getting better . " <p> But some things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something comforting in knowing that even the weatherman , with all his computers and radar , still can not do any more about it than any other farmer . <p> " We 're still at the mercy of the elements , " says Cook . " Those late frosts in the spring , early frosts in the fall . " <p> And the elements are n't the only thing they 're at the mercy of . <p> On this day , a water pump is being replaced , nematodes are declared the winners in their war on a field of tuberoses , and , as the couple show a visitor around the farm they spot yet another groundhog browsing about 25 yards down a hill . <p> " They just go right through the middle of the dahlias , " Ken Cook says . " They knock them over and eat them . " The deer eat their share , too . <p> But for Cook , none of these farmer struggles offsets the pleasure he gets , even from something as simple as riding the tractor - perils and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid getting hung in holes , " You can admire the clouds " while riding , he says . <p> " There is a sereneness " about the farm , he says . " The natural beauty of having a lot of different flowers at the same time . " <p> The Cooks enjoy this beauty only briefly because many of the flowers must be cut just as they start to open or just after they open in order to get them to market fresh . On the up side , they rarely have to watch masses of flowers fade and die ugly . <p> Once cut , the flowers are taken to a barn , banded with the little plastic strip that identifies them as Cook 's and stored in refrigerated rooms where the temperature is maintained at about 50 degrees . <p> In the larger of two rooms , the sweet smell from buckets of tuberoses and zinnias leaps out as the door is opened . The sight and the smell explain their appeal , to customers and to Cook . <p> Which raises the question : Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weatherman ? <p> " Maybe this is the real me out here , " he says , " wearing shorts and an old sloppy T-shirt , just digging in the dirt . I think that 's a very natural thing . Me in a studio with some kind of contraption and a light on the top of it - maybe that 's strange . " <p> But he quickly adds : " I do love the weather , and I love telling people about it . So , when I 'm in that environment , with my weather maps and radar and computers , that 's very natural also . "
