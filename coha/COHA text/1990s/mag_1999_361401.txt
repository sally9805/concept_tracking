THE NEW STAR WARS <P> I bought your Star Wars issue for my 11-year-old son CINEMA , April 26 and greatly enjoyed listening to him announce over breakfast the latest news and trivia about Episode I  --  The Phantom Menace . As a parent , I am happy to take him to see this film  --  not just for the dazzling special effects or the exciting story but because the Star Wars saga celebrates free will and contains lessons about persistence , faith and the necessity of hope . These stories appeal to children ; they never condescend but include their young audience in the fantasy and fun . My son proclaimed , as he finished your magazine and headed to school , " May the Force be with you ! " BARBARA LEE WILLIAMS Oakland , Calif . <P> Surely one of the signs of the apocalypse must be this stupefying Star Wars hysteria . This is a puny epic for people with no life . It is filled with crummy acting and dialogue and not a minute of intelligence or beauty .

DAN O'NEILL Los Angeles <P> Thank you for the wonderful story and pictures of The Phantom Menace . As a young mother , I eagerly waited along with my small son for the first Star Wars to come to our local theater . And then we had to take family and friends , going back to refight the battles . We saw it seven times . With the latest film , I will return to that special time with another little blue-eyed boy ( my grandson this time ) and fight new battles . THERESA CONNER Columbia Falls , Mont . <P> I am sad that George Lucas , with his talent , sees only a world where boys grow up to be soldiers and girls to be princesses . His is a society where men save the galaxy and women have a different costume for every event . Understandable , perhaps , in 1977 , when the first Star Wars film was released , but in 1999 ? Come on , George ! You want children to " think outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RICHARD PATTAY Greensboro , N.C. <P> Re Bill Moyers ' interview with Lucas : the paradox of Lucas ' monistic beliefs is that they can not explain the mythical themes that make Star Wars so powerful . Lucas has written a story of redemption , one that defines evil as a deviant , consuming corruption of the good . To make sense , Star Wars needs a personal God . But Lucas washes God out with his flimsy Force . The result ? Guidance without a guide , power without a purpose , goodness without a ground . Since the contradiction of a theistic myth in pantheistic clothing appears lost on Lucas , it also will surely be lost on most of his audience . MARK WARNOCK Tinley Park , Ill . <P> Your feature on Star Wars highlights the preoccupation of many adults and youngsters with fantasy as they spend their time watching electrons move across a computer screen .
