TWO CENTURIES AGO ASTRONOMERS WERE PUZZLING OVER THE NATURE OF NEBULAE . SOME OF THEIR EARLY CONCLUSIONS WERE PROPHETIC . * BY DAVID RUSSELL // IN 1924 Edwin Hubble used Cepheid variable stars to measure the distance to M31 . He determined once and for all that the famous " nebula " in Andromeda was too distant to belong to the Milky Way . By proving that this and other spiral nebulae are external galaxies-distant Milky Ways in their own right-Hubble expanded our view of the universe immensly and ended one of the great astronomical debates of the 20th century . This discovery , goes the usual story , marked the start of our modern view of the universe . But did it ? The idea that the nebulae are other galaxies imense " island universes " of stars in an intonceivably vast cosmos - was a very old one by the early 20th century . It began in the 1750s with the speculations by British astronomer Thomas Wright and German philosopher Immanuel Kant that the Milky Way was not infinite but a bounded , flattened disk . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible in telescopes were Milky Way-like collections of stars seen at great distances . Modern astronomy textbooks generally squeeze the entire 175 years from Wright to Hubble into a few paragraphs focused on the beginning and the end of the story . This abridgement implies that Wright 's views on external galaxies were n't in widespread favor until Hubble proved them . But was it really that simple ? If you like your stories unabridged , you may wonder what happened in those intervening years . A PRESCIENT NOTION . A few years ago I came across this curious passage.while reading Richard Anthony Proctor 's book Other Worlds Than Ours ( 1870 ) : " Yet once more , according to accepted views , thousands and thousands of galaxies , externat ton the sidereal system , can be seen with powerful telescopes . " Is this possible ? Were nebulae widely considered to be . external galaxies more than 5Q years before Hubble proved it ? I found szvortina evidence ina short article titled " A new theory of the.:universe " in the Loion Popular Science Review ( 1869 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward a new theory respecting the arrangement of the stars and nebulae . Instead of looking upon the nebulae as for the most part external galaxies of stars , he considers that they belong to our own sidereal system . " Furthermore , in astronomy books published during most of the 1800s authors consistently referred to nebulae as external galaxies . For example , Thomas Dick made the following lyrical remarks in his book Sidereal Heavens ( 1840 ) : " Winging our flight from the Milky Way over unknown and immeasurable regions , regions where infinitude appears opening upon us in awful grandeur , we approach some of those immense starry clusters called the Nebulae , every one of which may be considered as another Milky Way , with its ten thousands and millions of suns . " The influence of this view can be found in popular writings of the time as well . Here is a passage from Edgar Allan Poe 's lengthy essay " Eureka , " published in a popular magazine in 1848 : " The Galaxy , let me repeat , is but one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the miscalled " nebulae " revealed to us - by the telescope alone , sometimes - as faint hazy spots in various quarters of the sky . We have no reason to suppose the Milky Way really more extensive than the least of these nebulae . ' Its vast superiority in size is but an apparent superiority arising from our position in regard to it - that is to say , from our position in its midst . " Poe went on to predict , correctly , that there are clusters of galaxies and even superclusters of clusters . In books published after 1870 , comments show that opinions had changed but that astronomers had indeed once regarded nebulae as external galaxies . For example , in his treatise Popular Astronomy ( 1884 ) , Simon Newcomb stated " This idea that the nebulae were other galaxies was more or less in vogue among popular writers until a quite recent period . " RIGHT ANSWER , WRONG REASON . Since many sources confirm that before 1870 nebulae were considered external galaxies , why was the " great debate " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1870 and 1924 that caused a correct idea to fall out of favor ? The answer is ironic : new observations and better maps of the sky led to the notion 's rejection . To make sense of this paradox we must understand early ideas about the universe 's form . In papers published in 1784 and 1785 , William Herschel outlined a strategy for investigating our galaxy 's structure . His method was based on two assumptions , that stars are distributed fairly uniformly through space and that they are also uniform in absolute magnitude . Herschel thus counted the stars in his telescope 's field to estimate the relative distance to the edge of the galaxy in that direction . The more stars , the farther the edge . If stars were uniformly distributed , clumpy internal nebulae simply did n't fit well into the picture . Herschel 's influence no doubt fostered the acceptance of nebulae as external galaxies . However , as Herschel continued his studies he realized that the assumptions of uniformity were wrong and that many nebulae were probably gaseous and part of the Milky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When we examine the Milky Way , or the closely compressed clusters of stars , of which my catalogues have recorded so many instances , " he wrote , " this supposed equality of scattering must be given up . We may have also surmised nebulae to be no other than clusters of stars disguised by their very great distance ; but a longer experience and a better acquaintance with the nature of nebulae will not allow a general admission of such a principle . " Ironically , Proctor suggested that few astronomers noticed Herschel 's change of view . So the idea that nebulae are external galaxies continued despite its rejection by Herschel himself . A NEW IDEA EMERGES . In his book The Universe and the Coming Transits ( 1874 ) , Proctor outlined many of the observations that caused astronomers to change their ideas about galaxies . These observations fell into two categories : those that contradicted assumptions of stellar uniformity and those that indicated nebulae are a physical part of the Milky Way . Proctor himself compared the proper motions of bright stars with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each group . This indicated that stars of very different apparent magnitudes often lie at the same distance from us , and thus stars did not all have the same true brightness . Proctor also discovered what he called " star-drift " - groups of stars having the same proper motion  --  confirming the clustering of stars in a way other than by visual impressions . A variety of mid-19th-century observations suggested nebulae could be considered part of the Milky Way . For example , in 1864 William Huggins found spectroscopic proof that some nebulae are indeed gaseous and thus are n't star clusters or galaxies too distant to be resolved into stars . Photograph Based on his early assumption of stellar uniformity , William Herschel created this map of a section of the Milky Way in 1785 . From Simon Newcomb 's PopularAstronomy Photograph Charts of stellar distribution suggested to Richard Proctor the existence of " star streams " and " star sprays " that contradicted the notion that stars are uniform in distribution and magnitude . Note how the stars on this plot appear to form chains with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomer Friedrich Argelander. // Perhaps the most fascinating argument was based upon a distribution pattern familiar to amateur astronomers . Star clusters , planetary nebulae , and emission nebulae are primarily found in the plane of the Milky Way . In contrast , galaxies seem most concentrated where stars are thinly spread - in the general region of the galactic poles . Today this distribution makes sense because we know that star clusters and nebulae are generally concentrated toward the midplane of the Milky Way 's disk , while dust in the disk blocks our view of other galaxies . But this pattern made a different kind of sense to mid-19th-century astronomers . To them it indicated that the fuzzy objects must be nebulae within our sidereal system . In Other Worlds Than Ours Proctor wrote : " We have , then , no other conclusion to form but that the association thus observed between starless regions and richness of nebular distribution indicates a very close relation indeed between the stars and nebulae ; that in fact , the nebulae in a sense represent the missing stars , that the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so to speak , in order to form them . " Proctor explicitly rejected extinction in the galactic plane as an explanation for the nebulae 's distribution . The largest reflectors of the time seemed capable of nearly resolving the farthest edges of the Milky Way . If light was being blocked the edges should not be resolvable . These arguments influenced the thinking of astronomers and helped to set the stage for the great debate of the early 20th century . Consider the following two passages : Photograph // " On the other hand , nebulae as a class show a distinct aversion for the galaxy , and are found most abundantly in those parts of the sky farthest from it , much as if they represented the raw material which was lacking along the Milky Way , because it is already worked up to make the stars which are there so numerous . " ( George Comstock , 1901 ) " If however , there are other stellar systems of the same order as our own , they are neither the nebulae nor the clusters which the telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument at present existing . " ( Charles Young , 1902 ) The fall of the view that nebulae are external galaxies left astronomers wondering if stars formed systems at all . Proctor believed that the universe was probably fairly uniform to begin with , and that through " processes of aggregation " it developed stars of differing sizes , clusters of stars , and gaseous masses gathered into annular or spiral shapes . He speculated that some force , perhaps centrifugal , caused matter to aggregate near the galactic poles , forming irresolvable nebulae but few stars . In Popular Astronomy Simon Newcomb was less willing to assign a structure to the universe , confirming only that it was a disk or perhaps a ring with the Sun near the center and nebular regions on either side . History is contingent . There was no one path destined to connect Wright to Hubble . If nebulae had been considered external galaxies throughout the late l9th century , would the debate of the early 20th century have been monumental ? Or would Hubble 's observations merely have been a ho-hum confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel 's observation of stellar parallax in 1838 proved that Copernicus was right and Earth orbits the Sun ? Perhaps Hubble never would have taken an interest in the nature of nebulae , and today the " tuning-fork " classification of galaxies , the eagerly sought expansion rate of the universe , and even the Space Telescope would carry a different name .
