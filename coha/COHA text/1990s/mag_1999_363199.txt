LIGHT IT UP When you think of halogen bulbs , those omnipresent black floor lamps from Ikea may come to mind . But a new bulb from Philips will turn any fixture into a gale-force illuminator for $5.99 . Halogena is the size of an ordinary incandescent but so intensely bright that Philips had to turn down the wattage from 75 to 40 for those bulbs that will take a star turn lighting the fabled Times Square ball on New Year 's Eve . <P> LEAP TO IT When you tell your kid to jump , does she ask , " How high ? " No matter ; if she 's wearing Reebok 's new Traxtar shoe , the shoe will answer for her . Designed for kids ages 6 to 11 , Traxtar 's built-in microprocessor notes how fast its wearer runs , jumps or leaps . As kids move to new performance levels , the shoe 's display " pod " flashes and plays Pomp and Circumstance . TRAXTAR.COM , a companion website , offers codes to punch into the pod to make it play other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for teens . <P> CART BEFORE THE MOUSE Like to comparison-shop ?
