<p> Never mind the corny clowns , brassy bands and frilly floats . Everyone knows where the real action is during the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day parade . <p> Up there . In the sky . <p> " The clowns are the heart , the bands are the voice and the floats are the stages , " says Jean McFaddin , overseer of the department store 's parade preparations for the past 14 years . " But the balloons are the signature . You know when you see the mouths drop open that one just flew over . " <p> Those bobbing behemoths of urethane-coated nylon are what lifts this 2 1/2-mile parade ( 9 a.m . EST/1 p.m . PST Thursday , NBC ) above the ordinary . For Macy 's 64th miracle on 34th Street - which makes most other parades look like mere strolls down the street - there are 13 balloons , the most ever . <p> Joining the ever-changing lineup for the first time : Bart Simpson , atop a skateboard , and Clifford the Big Red Dog . " Clifford is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canine who 's 60 feet long and 40 feet high . " He really is as big as a house . " <p> Norman Bridwell , Clifford 's proud creator , never thought his dog would fly . " After 27 years , it 's a true form of acceptance . " <p> And what is TV 's most popular underachiever 's reaction ? " I hope it 's really windy , man , " Bart says . " I 'm only in this for the ride . " <p> Returning this year : Quik Bunny , Big Bird , Spiderman , Woody Woodpecker , Pink Panther , Ronald McDonald , Bugs Bunny , Snoopy and Woodstock , and the Snuggle Bear . Kermit the Frog will hop back after a three-year rest as part of a tribute to the late Jim Henson . <p> The addition of a second inflation site ( besides 77th Street at Central Park West , there 's now one at 81st ) makes this year 's bigger blow-up blowout possible . With balloons averaging 5-6 stories high , no wonder Macy 's is the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. government . <p> Starting at midnight tonight , the still-deflated balloons will make their way into Manhattan from a warehouse across the Hudson River in Hoboken , N.J. <p> Just like Santa has his workshop in the North Pole , Macy 's has its Hoboken parade studio . A week before T-Day , workers are putting the finishing touches on Barbie 's pink float . The living doll herself ( actually a human incarnation with a haystack of blond hair ) lip-syncs a chirpy ditty . <p> Visiting school kids yelp with joy as two puppies , each the size of a pair of elephants , playfully pass a giant ball back and forth on a float . <p> But nothing can compete with the hard-to-ignore giants in this cramped warehouse : Paddington Bear , 29 feet of huggable-ness , and a 36-foot-high Wicked Witch , slumped in a corner . " She 's melting , " cries a young Wizard of Oz expert . Some dare not venture too near the witch , a wise move considering one of her green hands ( with 4-foot fingers topped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time . <p> But Paddington and the witch are not just balloons . They are " falloons , " a float-balloon that makes its debut this year . Unlike the helium-gobblers , they travel on the ground and are inflated by cold-air fans . <p> Macy 's has a long history of creating innovative magic to delight the 2.5 million who line the parade route and the more than 80 million watchers at home . Some highlights : <p> - Why giant balloons ? The tradition began in 1927 , three years after the parade started . First up : Felix the Cat , the Turkey and the Serpent . Some histories suggest that inflatables were used after real animals scared children . Others say that it was so kids could see without perching on a grown-up 's shoulders . <p> Cindy Smith of Aerostar Industries , Sioux Falls , S.D. , makers of Macy 's balloons since 1984 , has another theory . " They have to have something that large to compete with the skyscrapers . It takes a lot to impress New Yorkers . " <p> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released at the end and rewards were given to those who found them . No one remembered that helium expands at high altitudes . The trick was a bust . <p> Sound effects were tried in 1933 ( the Dachshund barked , the Pig oinked ) but were quickly discarded . <p> - Inflated egos . In cartoon land , being a Macy 's balloon is akin to getting a star on the Walk of Fame . The selection committee ? " The children of the world , " says McFaddin , who seeks feedback from kids . When Macy 's officials decide who 'll be called to duty , they contact the creators to help with the designs . <p> Among the lucky 113 : Mickey Mouse ( the first of three in 1934 ) , Popeye ( 1957 ) , Bullwinkle ( 1961 ; retired in 1983 ) , Underdog ( 1965 ) , Superman ( the largest balloon ever at 104 feet long , 1980 ) , Olive Oyl ( the first female - not counting Elsie the Cow - 1982 ) , Betty Boop ( 1985 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1934 ) . <p> - Do n't rain on my parade . The elements are mortal enemies . Rain , snow and especially wind can do great bodily harm to a balloon . <p> Although the parade has never been canceled because of inclement weather ( it took World War II to stop it , 1942-44 , when the balloons were donated as scrap rubber ) , there have been some scary moments . <p> Veteran handlers still recall with a shiver the 45-mph gusts in 1956 that pushed balloons into buildings and trees . Only Mighty Mouse made it to the finish line at Herald Square . <p> Last year 's Thanksgiving snowstorm ( the first in New York City in 51 years ) was no picnic . Bugs Bunny got cold feet and stayed in his hole . And Snoopy 's nose got punctured . <p> No flakes in the forecast this year , but there may be a few sprinkles . <p> - The Weeble that wobbled . Of course , McFaddin admits , not every character takes to flight . Back in the 1970s , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toy shaped like an egg - was made into a balloon . <p> " The trouble was eggs do n't fly very well , " explains McFaddin . " They added a skirt for balance , but Weebles were n't girls . So it just sat in a box for years . " <p> But the ever-resourceful Macy 's folks turned the Weeble into Humpty Dumpty for the parade 's 60th anniversary in 1986 . Sadly , Humpty later suffered a great fall during an Easter promotion and was put to rest . <p> - Getting a handle . About 2,500 Macy 's workers and relatives take part as volunteers each year . About 40 play Lilliputians to each Gulliver-size inflatable . The only string attached to being a handler : You have to weigh at least 150 pounds . <p> Macy 's financial status has sprung a few leaks lately . While the promoters never like to discuss cost ( " It 's our gift to the city , " says McFaddin ) and sponsors pay for most floats and balloons , there has been talk that the parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't too concerned . " We 've survived World War II and a helium shortage during the Korean War . If we ever needed this kind of joy , it 's now . " <p> One fan who hopes the fun never stops is Today 's Willard Scott , host of the parade since 1987 . " This is a real labor of love for me . It turns us all into children for three hours . " <p> Scott says his favorite balloon is the Pink Panther . Will there ever be a Willard balloon ? Says the roly-poly elf himself : " I do n't think there 's enough helium in the world to fill it . " CUTLINE : KERMIT : He returns in a tribute to Jim Henson . CUTLINE : POACHED EGG : Humpty Dumpty was an ex-Weeble . CUTLINE : CLIFFORD : The big red canine of children 's book fame , shown in a test flight , is 60 feet long and 40 feet high .
