<p> A woman lies asleep in her bed , sighing and moaning as if in the grip of an erotic dream . Her husband , awakened by the passionate sounds , opens his eyes in astonishment . So does their dog . The scene cuts back to the woman and we see what she 's dreaming about  --  racks and racks of discount clothes . <p> The provocative TV spot , which broke this week , is part of a $ 1 million advertising campaign heralding next week 's grand opening of the Great Mall of the Bay Area  --  a 1.5 million-square-foot **25;288;TOOLONG project that will be California 's largest discount shopping center . <p> The mall , the biggest to open in the United States this year , is located in Milpitas , at the southern tip of the bay , in what was once a Ford assembly plant . During the past year , the sprawling site , the equivalent of 52 football fields , has been redeveloped at a cost of roughly $ 100 million . <p> A joint venture of Ford Motor Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Virginia development company , the center will open on Thursday with eight anchor tenants , including Oshman 's SuperSports , Burlington Coat Factory and Old Navy Clothing Co. , and 150 discount stores and factory outlets , among them Levi 's , Bugle Boy and Clothestime . <p> There will be six restaurants and a food court featuring 15 small eateries , as well as an entertainment center with state-of-the-art video games . <p> The Great Mall represents a tremendous vote of confidence in the Bay Area retail scene by its developers , who expect total sales to exceed $ 350 million in 1996 . When fully leased , the mall will employ about 4,000 full- and part-time employees . <p> VALUE-ORIENTED <p> " Studies indicated to us that the Bay Area is under-retailed , " said Bill McNair , vice president of Ford 's western property division . " With the shift in retailing toward more value-oriented shopping , we came to the conclusion that this was the direction we should take . It also meant that we did n't have to completely demolish a manufacturing facility . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> The Great Mall reflects the tenor of the times . In recent years , business at many traditional shopping centers has slowed to a crawl , while sales at discount-oriented malls have boomed . <p> Factory outlet centers have benefited the most . These complexes typically occupy about 130,000 square feet and feature **31;315;TOOLONG stores that offer merchandise at up to 75 percent off the retail price . <p> Critics complain that the factory centers tend to carry limited selections of out-of-season merchandise and that bargains are not that plentiful . <p> Today there are nearly 300 outlet centers in the United States , up from about 100 five years ago , according to the International Council of Shopping Centers , a New York trade group . <p> In the Bay Area , the three biggest are in Vacaville , San Leandro and Gilroy . Another big center will open in Tracy later this year . <p> DEVELOPERS BOAST <p> The Great Mall 's developers boast that the Milpitas center will be the " largest outlet mall " in the state , but it is actually a hybrid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailers like Marshalls . <p> This mixed-use format was pioneered by Mills Corp. , a Washington , D.C. , developer that operates four such shopping centers  --  one in the Midwest and three on the East Coast . All are said to be successful . Mills has announced plans to open two malls in Southern California . <p> " The term ' outlet ' is very sexy these days , and it lures a lot of people , " said Dawn Frankfort , consumer marketing director at Value Retail News , a Florida publisher of trade magazines on outlet centers . " But ( the Great Mall ) is not what we would consider a true outlet center . " <p> BIGGER THAN MOST <p> For one thing , it is bigger than most outlet centers . For another , it is enclosed . <p> Retail sources agree that the Great Mall will challenge not only the factory outlet centers in the Bay Area , but also dozens of regional malls and discount-oriented centers , especially in the South Bay . <p> The Milpitas Town Center , just miles from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marshalls , to the Great Mall . <p> " We 're obviously concerned , " said Kelly Erardi , director of commercial development for Shapell Industries , the developer of Milpitas Town Center . " But there 's not a whole bunch we can do about it . " <p> Mike Flavin , president of the Milpitas Chamber of Commerce , agrees that many local retailers will be hurt , but he thinks that in the long run the Great Mall will provide an economic boost to Milpitas , a city of low-slung industrial parks and high-tech companies . <p> " The first five years will be trying for many retailers , " said Flavin . " But after that it will be great for the city . A lot of people will be traveling here to shop . " <p> John Petersen , general manager of the Great Mall , said that on opening day 65 percent of the center will be occupied . He added that 75 percent of the space has been leased . <p> Petersen said the initial occupancy rate hit projections , but several shopping-center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand opening . <p> The Great Mall has attracted some prestigious tenants , including A Touch of Cashmere , Rampage and Bebe , the trendy San Francisco women 's apparel company that is opening its first factory outlet in the Great Mall . <p> Petersen said lease negotiations are under way with New York-based Saks Fifth Avenue , which is planning to open a Saks Clearinghouse in the mall in January . <p> While the Great Mall and other discount formats will undoubtedly continue to grab business from full-price shopping centers , there are those who question the longevity of the concept , particularly given the changes under way in the department-store industry . <p> Bob Bartlett , a San Rafael retail consultant , notes that mergers like the Federated-Macy 's deal are making traditional retailers more cost efficient and competitive . <p> " Department stores will be in the position to set their prices to the point where they will be in the ballpark with many discounters , " said Bartlett . " The market differentiation is going to erode . In the long run , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where people will want to do all their shopping .
