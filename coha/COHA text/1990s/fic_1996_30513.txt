On their monthly visits to the prison , Aurora drove going and Rosie drove home . That was the tradition , and there was good reason for it : seeing her grandson behind bars , being reminded yet again that he had killed a woman , realizing that in all likelihood she would be seeing him only in such circumstances for the rest of her life , left Aurora far too shaken to be trusted at the wheel of a car  --  particularly the sputtery old Cadillac she refused to trade in . Aurora managed the Cadillac erratically under the best of circumstances , and visiting Tommy in prison could not be called the best of circumstances . Rosie and everyone else who knew Aurora felt sure the Cadillac would be the death of her someday , but it would not have been wise to reiterate this fear on the return trip from Huntsville , when Aurora would have been only too happy to die on the spot . Aurora , in the midst of a bitter fit of sobbing , nonetheless reached up and twisted the rearview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair . It was an old habit : when sorrow beset her , as it now did regularly , she often grabbed the nearest mirror , hoping , through vanity alone , to arrest it in its course before it did her too much damage . This time it did n't work , not merely because she was crying so hard she could n't see herself at all , but because Rosie  --  a woman so short she could barely see the traffic in front of her , much less that which she knew to be in pursuit , immediately grabbed the mirror and twisted it back . " Do n't do that , hon , I got to have my mirror ! " Rosie said , panicked because she heard the sound of a huge truck bearing down on them , but lacked a clue as to exactly how clo Conroe exit , Aurora calmed a little . " Rosie , I 'm not a robot , " she said . " I do not have to stop crying just because we happen to be passing Conroe . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosie said . " I wish I had n't never been born . But most of all I wish we had a Datsun pickup  --  the seat of this car is so old it 's sinking in , and if it sinks in much farther I wo n't be able to see anything but the speedometer . Then an eighteen-wheeler will probably run over us and squish us like soup in a can . " " This car is not a can and we will not be squished like soup , " Aurora declared , sniffing . " You 've chosen a bad figure . " " Yeah , I was always flat-chested , but I did n't choose it , God did it to me , " Rosie said , thinking it odd that Aurora would mention her lifelong flat-chestedness at such a time . " Oh , figure of speech , I meant , " Aurora said . " Of course you did n't choose your bosom . What I meant to point out is that there 's nothing souplike about either one of us . If you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is what you resemble . " Aurora felt no better , but she did feel cried out , and she began to mop her cheeks with a wad of Kleenex . She had already scattered several wet wads on the seat . She gathered these up , compressed them into one sopping mess , and threw the mess out the window . " Hon , you ought n't to litter , " Rosie admonished . " There 's signs all up and down this highway saying do n't mess with Texas . " " I 'll mess with it all I want to , " Aurora said . " It 's certainly messed enough with me . " When her vision cleared a bit more , she noticed that a stream of cars and trucks was flowing past them . Looking back , she saw with alarm that a very large truck seemed to be practically pushing the m . " Rosie , are you going the correct speed ? " she asked . " We 're not exactly leading the pack . " " I 'm going fifty-five , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just behind us has such an impatient aspect , " Aurora said . " I tell you every time we come here that the legal speed is now sixty-five , not fifty-five . You had better put the pedal to the metal , if that is the correct expression . " " The pedal 's to the metal , otherwise we would n't be moving at all , " Rosie said . " Why do you think I been bugging you about a Datsun pickup ? I could push the pedal through the radiator and this old whale would n't go more than fifty-five . Besides , the speed limit 's only fifty-five when you 're going through a town , and we 're going through Conroe . " " Do n't be pedantic when I 'm sad , " Aurora said . " Just try to go a little faster . " Rosie , in a daring maneuver , attempted to pass the sluggish white Toyota just as a truck behind them pulled out to pass them . The driver honked , and Rosie instantly whipped her arm out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeased , she actually stuck her head out the window , turned it , and glared at the truck driver . Unimpressed , the truck driver honked again , while Rosie , pedal to the metal , inched grimly past the white suburban . " Well , you do n't lack spunk  --  you never have or I 'd have squished you myself , " Aurora said . The trucker , perhaps annoyed , perhaps amused , began to tap his horn every few seconds , and Rosie  --  definitely not amused  --  stuck her arm out the window and left it there , with her middle finger extended for his benefit . The sight of her maid sustaining a rude gesture while virtually beneath the wheels of a giant truck made Aurora laugh . A vagrant bubbl e of mirth rose unexpectedly from inside her , but she had no more than started a little peal when sorrow came back in a flood and overran amusement , just as her Cadillac seemed about to be overrun by the eighteen-wheeler . " I hope it kills us , then this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying . " I 'm from Bossier City , and I ai n't about to be bullied by no truck , " Rosie said . She calculated that she now had at least a three-or-four-inch lead on the Toyota and was nerving up to make her cut to the right . When Aurora calmed for the second time they were well down the road past the airport exit  --  she could see the skyscrapers of downtown Houston through the summer haze . " I can no longer laugh without beginning to cry , " she reported , rolling down her window . She proceeded to mess with Texas to the extent of another fifteen or twenty Kleenex . " You was n't really laughing , you was just mainly crying , " Rosie said .
