For more than a century , Roman Catholics have flocked to the shrine at Lourdes to pray and bathe in the sacred waters of the grotto spring . Five million pilgrims are expected to visit this year , enriching the town by nearly $400 million . So many faithful are coming , in fact , that a holy-water shortage has developed . For the first time in its history , Lourdes is rationing the blessed potion . <P> Lourdes officials suggest that the shortage may even be a blessing in disguise . " It 's a good opportunity to explain to people that you do n't just come to Lourdes to drink the water or get dunked , " said spokesman Loic Bondu .
