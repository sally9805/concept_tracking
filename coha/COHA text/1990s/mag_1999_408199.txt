Plus boots for serious slop , lightweight raingear , and trekking poles with extra grip . // Ay , caramba ! " Honestly , those were my first words after unrolling L.L. Bean 's unique new 45(deg)F Burrito sleeping " bag . " Of course , my intended destination may have had something to do with my Mexican frame of mind . I was headed south of the border for Baja , where I would eventually sleep on breezy January shores ; warm , cactus-studded ridgelines ; and even frozen 6,000-foot mountain crests ( I swear by my last quesadilla that our water bottles iced 1/2-inch thick while perched on the Tropic of Cancer ) . During all those Baja nights , the flexible Burrito handled every temperature the peninsula threw my way . The versatility is due to the fact that I could choose whether I wanted one or two layers of Polarguard between me and the stars ( another layer protected my backside ) . But that 's not all . Completely unwrapped , the Burrito becomes a giant tortilla that can blanket an entire family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way more than once . The secret is a long zipper that wraps around the bottom of the rectangular-shaped bag . Picture the bag unzipped and open . You lie on the soft lining of flannel-like microfiber polyester in the middle third of the bag . The left flannel-lined third then wraps over you and snaps into the near-edge of the remaining third . Leave it like this for warm evenings . As the skies clear and the stars begin shimmering in frosty 3 A.M. brilliance , fold the last third over the top for two layers of insulation , and zip yourself in . The bag keeps your head warm with a mummystyle hood , and a drawstring pulls it snug around your face on cold nights . There 's also an ingenious fleece-lined foot pocket at the bottom of the bag to warm cold tootsies . All together , the features combine to produce a bag that kept me comfortable in below-freezing temperatures . But then , I 'm a warm sleeper . The downside of the rectangular foot area is the extra material at the corners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zipper and extra shell fabric enclosing the multiple layers of insulation . This adds up to at least a pound more than most mummies of a similar rating . The Burrito is also just too strange for some people . I loaned it to one bright amigo ( a Ph.D . in marine biology ) who never figured it out . On the other hand , a more engineering-oriented friend borrowed it for 10 days and came back raving about the various ways he could wrap himself . He and I agreed there 's nothing to rival the Burrito 's adaptability . Bottom line : The most versatile , allclimate summer bag on the market . Best for the mechanically inclined who do n't mind carrying a little extra weight . John Harlin THE NORTH FACE CATHEDRAL PASS BOOTS The trail high above the Snake River in Oregon 's Hells Canyon Wilderness had been morphed by rain , thawing spring sunshine , and too many cows . The result was a bog of slick mud several feet wide . We tried hopping along on the tiny islands of high ground between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly slipped and splashed ankle-deep into the gumbo . For four days , we slogged along trails intermittently dry and deep in mud . The spring melt-off also swelled the creeks to loud torrents . At the deep parts , we hopped from stones to fallen logs , and at shallow spots , we simply waded right through . For the desert , Hells Canyon was awfully wet and soggy . // L.L. Bean Burrito Bag Photograph HOTTER THAN JALAPENOS : Fold both flaps over and zip the Burrito tight for maximum warmth on cool summer nights . // The North Face Cathedral Pass Boots // Still , my feet stayed dry because I was wearing a pair of Cathedral Pass midweight leather boots from The North Face . Even though my pants were damp and mud-spattered up to the thighs , I pulled the boots off each evening and found dry , clean socks ( due in part , I 'm sure , to the gaiters I was wearing ) . On those rare days when the sun shined and I sweated like a Louisiana mule on an August afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linings wicked moisture from my feet . The full-grain Nubuck leather upper has just a few seams and proved thoroughly waterproof and breathable without the help of a waterproof/ breathable membrane , which can make a leather boot too hot . The gussetted Nubuck leather tongue rises about an inch higher than the above-the-ankle boot top to keep out mud and stones . The tongue 's underside , as well as the boot lining , sports spongy , molded foam that cradled my feet . The boots fit my wide , flat feet without requiring any breaking in or giving me so much as a warm spot , much less a hot spot . Besides wearing my Cathedral Passes in Hells Canyon , I hiked in them through Idaho 's Snake River Canyon and the foothills above my home in Boise and in all kinds of weather . The verdict : These boots happily marry the often competing qualities of comfort and support . The dual-density midsole and full-length nylon shank provide excellent underfoot support without feeling stiff . The North Face markets these boots as midweights designed for backpacking trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 pounds . They 're comfortable and solid enough that I 'd trust them on slightly longer trips with heavier loads . The sole 's deep lugs provide good traction on rock , gravel , and sand . The lacing system , which has one pair of hooks angled out of alignment with the other hooks and eyelets , lets you cinch the laces snugly over foot and ankle . The only faults I found were that the soft Nubuck upper is somewhat prone to gouging on rocks , especially at the toe where the rubber rand does not come up as high as I 'd prefer . Also , the footbed of my left boot came unglued after I 'd hiked several days in them , the top layer of foam separating from the stiffer bottom layer . A replacement insert and the original right boot insert held up fine . Bottom line : An incredibly comfortable , solid , breathable , waterproof boot for the sort of backpacking trips most of us take . - Michael Lanza LOWE ALPINE ADRENALINE JACKET AND PANTS In all my outdoor experiments ( read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's one fundamental law of physics : If it 's bombproof , it 's bound to be heavy . Case in point is raingear . I own a fully featured parka and pants , complete with patches of heavy duty material at major wear points . But when it comes time to stuff my pack , more often than not the suit stays home . At 55 ounces , it weighs more than my solo tent . Lowe Alpine 's Adrenaline Jacket and Pants suit weighs half as much ( 22 ounces ) and still keeps you dry . Made from a lightweight ripstop nylon fabric coated with Triple Point Ceramic ( Lowe 's proprietary waterproof/breathable coating ) and sporting fully taped seams , the Adrenaline ensemble has held up well to repeated cloud bursts , including a stretch of wet , 40(deg)F weather along the Ice Age Trail in northern Wisconsin 's Chequamegon National Forest . Aside from its water-shedding abilities , the fabric has an agreeable texturequiet and supple-and even after numerous rounds of washing , wearing , and stuffing , water still beads up . Breathability is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when it comes to ventilation , there 's room for improvement . I was comfortable while walking on a smooth Lake Superior beach near Wisconsin 's Graveyard Creek . Then I started up a slope and the lack of pit zips left me sweaty . Ventilation mainly comes from the one-way , full-length front zipper . Hook-and-loop strips offer adjustments and some ventilation at the wrists . Waist-level mesh handwarmer pockets open and close via zippers and offer good storage . But because of their low-rider position , the pockets are blocked when you 're wearing a pack , defeating their venting capabilities . Lack of an internal lining causes the fabric to feel clammy against bare skin . ( The pants , on the other hand , vent well through fulllength , two-way side zippers . ) All in all , I 'd happily accept a few extra ounces to have underarm zips and a two-way front zipper on the jacket . // Lowe Alpine Adrenaline Jacket and Pants // An adjustable hood moves with you and accommodates everything from a bulky pile balaclava to a baseball cap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romping fisher in northwestern Wisconsin 's Chippewa Moraine country . A strap on the top controls volume , while a cordlock at the chin snugs up the front and does n't smack you in the face on windy days . The hood offers good coverage , keeping my glasses reasonably dry in all but the most extreme conditions , and stows away when not in use . With my body size ( 5 ' 10 " , 170 lbs. , 31 " inseam ) , I give the large size of the Adrenaline high marks for fit and freedom of movement . When high winds had me looking for shelter , I appreciated the jacket 's butt coverage and elasticized hem . Both jacket and pants roll into a bundle not much larger than a pair of heavy socks , and stuff into their own mesh pockets . By the end of the testing period , repeated stuffing had taken its toll and a pants pocket seam was unraveling in several places . However , not brush or rocks or the claws of my neighbors ' over-friendly Labrador retriever could put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowe Alpine Adrenaline Jacket and Pants are reasonably priced , lightweight , waterproof/breathable garments well suited to three-season trail hiking . - Eric Hansen GSI OUTDOORS BUGABOO TEFLON COOKSET My favorite meals-lentil chili with rice and vegetables , hash browns , pasta with chicken and veggies , beef stew , rice and beans , chicken curry with rice-have major sticking potential . And the raspberry crisp dessert we enjoyed one night in Washington 's North Cascades provided an especially colorful mess . Add to this the fact that I do n't like to do dishes after a hard day on the trail , and you have someone who was delighted to discover GSI Outdoors ' easy-to-clean Bugaboo Teflon Cookset . A few wipes with a wet sponge and the Bugaboo 's nonstick interior is squeaky clean . // GSI Outdoors Bugaboo Teflon Cookset // The five-piece aluminum and Teflon cook set includes a 1.5-quart pot , 1quart pot , two lids that function as fry pans , a pot grabber , an elastic strap to hold the set together , and a mesh storage bag . ( Larger cook sets and single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot grippers that can bite into any part of a pot 's rim , GSI 's DiamondBack Versa Gripper is designed to clamp down on the small brackets riveted to the side of the pots and lids . This may sound like an inconvenience but it 's not . In fact , it protects the nonstick surface from scratches and provides a tenacious , vicelike hold on the pots . The larger pot has two brackets ; the smaller pot and lids each have one bracket . Other smart features include rounded bottom edges for easy cleaning and narrow circular ridges on the bottoms that help keep the pots from slipping around on top of a packstove burner . On the down side , the nonstick finish mars easily . GSI recommends packing the Bugaboo set with a towel between the pots ( not included ) , but my pots still show scratching that in another 100 meals may inhibit the nonstick performance . This two-pot , two-lid set has a blue and black exterior ( to absorb heat more efficiently ) and weighs 25.5 ounces . Leave a lid or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line : If you despise dish duty , the easy-cleaning Bugaboo may be your meal ticket . Treat it kindly and it should offer years of service . - Betty Renkor KOMPERDELL CONTOUR GRIP FOAM As a tall guy with bad ankles and a worse sense of balance , I 'm a big fan of trekking poles , especially the telescoping kind that absorb shock and adjust quickly for climbs and descents . But making dozens of adjustments a day is a hassle and adds wear-and-tear on twist-lock mechanisms . Komperdell solves these problems with the Contour Grip Foam , a threesection aluminum pole with a foam grip extending 8 inches below the handle . In over 200 miles of testing last spring , I found that the elongated grip provides two significant benefits : a secure grasp when you choke up to traverse or climb a slope , and insulation for your hand on cold days . This means no more futzing with pole length or worrying about twist locks freezing shut with the poles in the shortest position . Simply adjust the pole to the maximum length you 'll need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any I 've felt , and in most conditions my hands and gloves adhered to it like gum on a hot sidewalk . Unlike stiffer , slicker cork or rubber grips , this handle never slipped out of my hand or caused friction blisters on my thumbs . The grip 's main vulnerability appeared during a snowy trip on Washington 's Mt . Rainier , when wet flakes clung to the porous foam , then froze into a crust as temperatures dropped , turning the handle into a foam icicle . In drier , colder conditions , this was n't a problem . ( The Contour Grip is also available in cork and cork anti-shock versions . ) In terms of weight and durability , the pole compares favorably with other three-section models , though I did snap one pole on a hard telemark turn in Montana 's Lee Metcalf Wilderness . The replacement handled the rigors of regular trail use just fine , but I would n't recommend the Contour Grip for aggressive backcountry touring . There 's no sign of deterioration in the twist locks , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous stream crossings and steep hills . // Komperdell Contour Grip Foam // Bottom line : An elongated foam handle takes the hassle out of adjustable trekking poles and insulates your hand against cold metal . - Jonathan Dorn Sidebar Find Gear In A Flash Sidebar Boots worn out ?
