" And then of course there was , uh , great sex , " says Sheila Williams , a young pediatrician , to her friend Alison Green . She is trying to explain the long presence in her life of a man who in many ways made her unhappy . Dick , a very smart , politically visible young lawyer , with whom she has just broken up . Dick is white , Sheila black . Small and neat and trim , from Roxbury , Mass. , Sheila is from a religious family , and tends to be somewhat prim ; this conversation is unusual for her . <p> Alison is also young , although her long dark-blond hair , knotted up , is streaked with white . She edits a small art magazine , which does not take up a lot of her time . She is also an unmarried mother Jennifer is four ) which does take time . She has reacted to her friend 's last remark , about great sex , in several ways : relief that Sheila is no longer seeing Dick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase , " great sex " - that not being taken for granted by herself , nor by anyone she knows . She has the further observation that " great sex " has become in some instances one word , " We had greatsex , " some people say . <p> The two women are seated in a pretty , still-cheap French restaurant out on Geary Street , in San Francisco . Drinking white wine , as they wait for their dinner . They are longterm friends , with a shared Berkeley past , but busyness now prevents seeing much of each other , and so their visits always have a catching-up quality ; they discuss work , love affairs , Alison 's daughter , and sometimes Sheila 's two dogs-in a usually jumbled order ; the categories overlap . Sheila , who is basically shy , reluctant as to personal revelation , has a lot to say about her work , which is at the San Francisco General Hospital and also involves the parents of her patients , most of whom are poor : black , Asian , or Hispanic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alison and Sheila , even generally about sex . It was unusual for Sheila to say what she had . But breaking up with Dick has made her more vulnerable , more open , perhaps . <p> Earlier they had been comparing their just passed days ; a bad one all around , they had agreed , bad for them both . Alison that morning had taken Jennifer to the airport , for a weekend in Santa Barbara with Alison 's mother , the grandmother whom Jennifer adored . A friend of Alison 's , Susan , had been going and offered to escort Jennifer , who was thrilled at the whole prospect . But the planes were all delayed because of fog-planes to anywhere , Paris or Djakarta , Singapore or just Santa Barbara . Sheila had had terrible , terminal trouble with her car . <p> Nothing earthshaking for either of them , solvable problems , just annoying . Alison called and cancelled her appointments , told her assistant to reschedule , and she finally put a very excited Jennifer on the plane . And Sheila called the Triple-A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her office . <p> But now , with the wine , Sheila 's phrase about great sex begins to reverberate in Alison 's brain . She has not been " seeing " anyone for at least a couple of years , and perhaps for that reason her mind returns to three instances of sex that was the greatest . <p> " Holy screwing , " was how her first lover used to put it ; he was a graduate student at Berkeley , in mathematics ; they smoked a great deal of pot together and made love effortlessly , wonderfully . Later , somehow , their connection fell apart , and he went east to a teaching job . <p> After that , graduated , Alison worked at part-time gallery jobs in San Francisco , and tried for journalism assignments . In that uncertain period of her life she fell in love with an older ( twenty years older than she was ) sculptor , semi-famous , and with him too the sex was  --  great . An earthquake , with deeper aftershocks . <p> Out of bed they also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some glorious High Sierra hikes . They moved in together and planned to marry , " sometime , when we get around to it . " But then he was killed , at the corner of Market and Franklin Streets , " senselessly , " by a hit-and-run red-light-runner , who was never caught but whom Alison , even now when she is " better , " dreams of killing . <p> After that , for Alison there was hard work and some slow success-publication of articles in increasingly prestigious art magazines . And scattered , occasional love affairs . Sometimes great sex , sometimes not so great . And then , all inner wisdom notwithstanding , she fell in love with a man who was married- " happily , " or at least comfortably enough , conveniently , so that he told her from the start that he could not , or would not , dislodge himself . Besides , there were three children . But with him , once more , there was holy , earthquake sex . She liked him very much , and he her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , and often came to San Francisco-sometimes alone , sometimes not . Seeing each other was often difficult , but for a time they managed . Alison lived on Potrero Hill , conveniently near the freeway . And even an hour together was worth anything , they felt . <p> When Alison became pregnant Jack was sympathetic : bad luck , he saw it as , and of course she would have an abortion , of course he would pay , and he would do everything possible , supportively . But Alison could not . She had had one abortion , the result of carelessness during a somewhat feckless affair . She had voted and marched for women 's right to choice . But this time she could not , not possibly . Jack quite reasonably argued that he too should have a choice , since the baby was also his-and Alison saw that this was true . Still , she had to go ahead with this pregnancy . And she did , and lovely Jennifer was born ; sometimes Alison even thought that she had somehow known that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sheila , her friend , just then starting in pediatrics , became their doctor . Now Sheila , really out of character , is still talking about great sex . And about Dick , the man she no longer sees , who was an ungiving , emotionally stunted person , as Sheila had always known . " Sometimes I thought he got some sort of charge out of having a black girlfriend , " Sheila said . " A liberal credential. so correct . But there were other sides to him . Moments of kindness , generosity , and these flashes of amazing insight . Enough of all that to make me stick around . What I 'm saying is , he 's not all bad . " Sheila laughs , but her dark brown eyes are wide and serious . <p> " We 're supposed to think no one is , are n't we ? " Alison laughs too . The waiter brings their food ; they seem to have ordered a lot . Somewhat later Sheila more or less continues . " I think it 's these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , or almost all , and that 's what keeps us around . We all think that 's the real person . That what we 're seeing is a window into who he really is . " She adds , " I mean it 's one of the things . With really battered women of course there 's also fear , no self-esteem and often no money . " " Oh , you 're right , " Alison tells her . She is struck by what sounds wise and accurate , although she herself has not experienced much meanness from men . <p> " Battered women , " Sheila now says . " People think , or some people think , they hang around for sex , but it 's not that , mostly . I was always hoping Dick would turn into the person I sometimes saw . " <p> Alison finds herself very moved by the fact of Sheila saying all this ; it is so unlike her to talk of intimate matters in this way . She is in fact more moved by Sheila herself than by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But possibly , also , Sheila is theorizing in part as a way out of pain ? <p> Sheila now asks Alison , " You 've got plans for your childless weekend ? " <p> " I 've got work . " Alison grins . " Probably I should have planned more . " And indeed she should have , she now thinks . She is unused to weekends without Jennifer ; it is not as though she had longed for such unfettered time . <p> The somewhat antiquated or at least other-era impression made by this restaurant , with its worn white linen table cloths , white ruffled curtains and fake white daisies in the decorative fake brick windows-all that is increased by the music , which is 3os and 40s ; at the moment Charles Trenet is singing , " Vous-qui passez sans me voir- " <p> The room at this hour , about eight , is filling up . Alison , absorbed in their conversation , and then her food , has not paid much attention to the other guests . <p> But she looks up just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short plump woman in black , a tall thin man with familiar shoulders . They come in slowly , as though in a horror film , Alison 's own oft-imagined worst dream ; lack and his wife . At the instant in which she recognizes him he turns and sees her , and starts toward their table . As his wife , long bright blonde hair swinging , goes on to a table across the room . <p> Smiling widely , as Alison also is , he arrives . He bends toward hercan he have meant to exchange a social kiss ? Alison extends her hand , as she says , " How nice to see you . You remember Sheila ? " <p> " Yes of course . " He shakes hands with Sheila too , and says , " Nice place ! " <p> They have been there together several times . <p> " Oh , very . " <p> " Well , uh , everything okay ? " <p> He must be asking , is Jennifer okay ? Alison nods , and then he is gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face recede . <p> She looks down at all the food on her plate , she says , " I ca n't eat this , " and she adds , " Oddly enough , " with a very small laugh . <p> " Of course not . " Understanding Sheila . " Take some deep breaths . " Alison does breathe deeply , managing too to glance across the room . At her . And she thinks , I 'm prettier than she is . An out-of  --  character thought : Alison is neither especially vain , nor for that matter is pretty the word for her , as she knows . She is often described as attractive , tall and thin , with an interesting , angular face . Good bones . But Jack 's wife is too old for her very bright long blond hair , and too plump for her very short black dress . <p> Sheila , who has also managed a look , now whispers , " Could it be a wig ? " <p> Alison laughs softly . " I suppose , but I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a perfect day . " <p> Four years ago , or five by now , it must be five-when Alison was pregnant , she and Jack quarreled a lot , and each said melodramatic , bad things to the other . <p> " You 're ruining your life- " <p> " It 's my life , you 're completely insensitive- " <p> " You 're crazy-hysterical-you have no sense- " <p> " I never want to see you again-just stay away- " <p> Since then , and since Jennifer 's birth there has been a polite , somewhat stilted , occasional exchange of notes-Alison 's sent to Jack 's office , of course , as in fact her notes always were . For a while he sent money , checks that in her high pride Alison never cashed . Besides , by then she was doing pretty well on her own . The magazine though tiny paid her a good salary ; its backer needed the tax loss . And she sold more and more articles . <p> Jack had never asked to visit , although she assumed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now Alison asks Sheila , " What shall we do with all this food ? Would your dogs eat it ? " <p> " No , the bones are too small . We 'll have the waiter wrap it and we can leave it in a package for some homeless person . " <p> That night Alison 's sleep is broken , very troubled . She is plagued with dreams that vanish at the slightest touch of her conscious mind . She believes Jack has been the focus of these dreams , but she is not entirely sure , nothing is clear . And when in her waking mind she thinks of him , his image is confused , as possibly it always was . There is the sensual memory of him , his weight , his bones crushing into hers , the hot smooth skin of his back , in her clutching hands . And then there is the loud-voiced angry Jack , who insists that she have an abortion . She finds , though , still another man , Jack the kind and super-intelligent good friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment ; their childhoods ; Bosnia , Zaire , and Haiti ; Jack 's relations with the Sierra Club and other local environmentalists ; Alison 's magazine , local painters . And sometimes , even , their own connection ( both disliked the word " relationship " ) . They alternated between celebration ( it was so good , they care so much for each other ) - and sadness ( it was necessarily limited ; they could not , for instance , travel together , or more to the point , live together ) . <p> Alison thinks too of what Sheila was saying , describing those windows of niceness that keep even battered women going ( did even O . J . have moments of niceness ? she wonders ) . As she stuck around with a man who meant to and probably would stay married , for whatever responsible , guilty reasons of his own . <p> She wonders : what will I do when he calls tomorrow , as he most likely will ? She thinks , at least Jennifer 's out of town . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw with sleeplessness , she decides to spend as much of the day as she can on a long city walk . When Jack calls her answering machine will pick it up , and she can do as she likes . She does walk , in the bright cool windy day , fog lingering on all the horizons of the city . Perfect for walking . She hikes down to the Embarcadero , and along all that way to the Ferry Building , past the new incongruous row of palms , and the old decaying empty wharves . <p> When she gets home , having walked for a couple of hours , she finds no messages , not one on her machine . Digesting what feels like keen disappointment , not relief , she simply stands there in her kitchen for a moment , looking out to her view of the Bay Bridge , the bay , and the Oakland hills . And the Embarcadero , where she just was . <p> The phone rings . She hesitates , answers on the third sound . <p> Jack . After a polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I 'm sorry about last night . I hope you were n't as shaken up as I was . But you know , I 've wanted to see you . To be more in touch . And Jennifer- " Some honest quality of pain in his voice is very moving to Alison ; it was good of him to say that he was upset . She tells him , " I 'm really sorry , Jennifer 's down in Santa Barbara with my mother . " A long pause , before he says , " Could I just see you for a little ? I really want to . " <p> She too pauses , and then says , " In an hour . I 've just got back from a walk . I have to shower . " <p> As he comes into her living room , and they shake hands-again , Alison observes what she had almost forgotten : that Jack is rather shy , and his glasses tend to slip down his longish nose . He is very tall , his posture bad , and he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're really nice to let me- " <p> " Well , of course- " <p> " No , not of course- " <p> Both wearing their shy smiles , they sit down at opposite ends of her sofa ( as they have before ) . Alison tells him , " Jennifer . I am sorry she 's not here , a friend was going to Santa Barbara for the weekend , Susan , I do n't think you met her . And it seemed such a good chance for Jennifer , she likes Susan and she really loves her grandmother , and she thinks Santa Barbara is great , the beach and all- " <p> She is babbling to stave off the sudden and unaccountable tears that threatened her eyes , and her voice . Alison realizes this , but she is afraid to stop . She adds , " She 's really nice- " <p> Looking at her with his slow shy smile , Jack says , " Of course she is . " <p> " Well , tell me how your work 's going ! You 're still happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Well , yes and no . " <p> He talks for a while , and Alison does not hear a word he says , as she thinks , he 's a very nice man , he really is . It was n't " just sex , " whatever that means . I think we can be friends , and he can come and see Jennifer sometimes . Friends . And I 'm not going to cry , and we wo n't make love . <p> But Alison is wrong . <p> After she has made tea , Twinings English Breakfast , which they drink , and after a lot more civilized conversation , Jack gets up to go , and as , staring at her with his very dark , myopic and beautiful hazel eyes , he starts to say goodbye , Alison distinctly hears the smallest catch in his voice , and she sees the effort at control that he makes . <p> Which is just enough , at last , to set off her tears-a minute before he truly meant to leave . <p> Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it does not work out that way . <p> They begin to kiss , and minutes later they have moved to Alison 's bedroom , where , on her bed , once more , they have great-the greatest sex . <p>
