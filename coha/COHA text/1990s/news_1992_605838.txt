<p> As a long-standing member of the " Keel Haul Biaggi " movement among boat owners , I found Burt Hoffman 's column refreshingly different , if of dubious sanity " Why Should Boats Get a Free Ride ? " op-ed , March 10 . He seems to be saying , " Sock it to me , Biaggi Baby , for I am a truly unworthy and vile boat owner and deserve to pay your wonderful boat-owner 's fee twice over . " Naturally , since he seems to like it so much , I would be more than willing to have him pay mine as well . <p> He cites all the wonderful things the Coast Guard does for us that would deserve our support . Unfortunately , there is little correlation between the payments and the justification . The fact of the matter is , these new " user fees " and increased contributions go into general revenue . That basically means that they are applied to two massive problems  --  the Department of Defense and the savings and loan collapse . <p> Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are highly economical . Boating safety is maintained through a largely volunteer effort . The Coast Guard Auxiliary , including patrols and the education staff , is unpaid . In 15 years of sailing , my stupid mistakes have put me in harm 's way about three times . In two cases , help was provided by private citizens , once by the Maryland Marine Police . None will benefit from the " boat tax . " Documentation carries a fee and is understaffed in the extreme  --  so much so that there is a small industry providing services to the applicant that the Coast Guard is not staffed to handle . Maryland charges a fee for documented vessels roughly equal to that for registration fee for undocumented vessels . <p> In any case , in the past few years the Coast Guard has grown smaller , reduced its support to the recreational boater and increased its drug enforcement role . <p> As for navigational aids , recently some maniac has renumbered most and moved many of the markers in the Chesapeake Bay , apparently for no other purpose than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the West River to the Number 73 buoy . Last spring I sailed to the same buoy , and it had been changed to Number 1 . That probably cost every cent of my first year boat tax . Turning south toward Crisfield , I found that most markers on a 1-year-old chart remained in place but had different numbers . That is not an aid to me but to the chart vendors . <p>  --  Pat Condray <p> Burt Hoffman 's column about taxes on recreational vessels is so full of misconceptions that it 's hard to know where to start to set the record straight . <p> First , there are all kinds of vessels using U.S. waters  --  vessels of the United States , including Navy , Coast Guard , Corps of Engineers etc. , freighters and tankers , ferry boats and excursion boats , cruise ships , oceanographic vessels , tugs and tows , dredges , cable-laying ships , oil exploration vessels , fishing boats , fire and police boats , rescue vessels , training ships etc . Since many of these are larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly marked channels , electronic aids to navigation , weather forecasting . ( In my little boat , I can stray far from the channel , and if I do run aground , I 'm not the Exxon Valdez . ) Thus all the services Hoffman lists would have to be provided if every recreational vessel were to disappear . <p> Second , none of the monies collected go to the Coast Guard or the other agencies that provide the services . <p> Third , for the chart that cost me 75 cents when I first ventured on the water , I now pay $ 14 . Most publications of use to the mariners are now priced to reflect the cost . <p> Fourth , the operator of a recreational vessel already pays taxes on fuel and in most jurisdictions pays an annual registration fee . ( In Washington , I pay $ 20 and in return have the Harbor Branch of the D.C. Police Department ready to give me a hand if I get in trouble . ) <p> Finally , this idea that people with boats are all wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at any marina , and see how modest most of these boats are . ( If I were to sell my boat , I might get $ 4,000 . ) <p> If Congress and the administration had taxed all vessels and had passed the funds along to the Coast Guard , the FCC , the the Corps of Engineers etc. , few would have objected . But these taxes were only on recreational vessels , and were therefore unfair . And no one likes to be treated unfairly . <p>  --  John L. Bender <p> Those who argue that boat owners are not paying their fair share are opposed to efforts in Congress to repeal two taxes recently assessed on boat owners and blue-collar workers who build boats . The first was the recreational boat-user fee , a $ 25 to $ 100 tax assessed by the Coast Guard on most of America 's boat owners . The second tax , also passed by Congress in 1990 , levies a 10 percent luxury tax on large boats valued at more than $ 100,000 . <p> The purpose and effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called " user fee " on recreational boats was that boaters paying the fee would receive new or improved services from the Coast Guard . In fact , the Coast Guard 's only role is that of tax collector . Those paying the tax are receiving no new or improved services . <p> But the user fee is nothing compared to the luxury tax . This gesture , designed to hit the rich , has instead eliminated as many as 25,000 ship-building jobs across the nation , as rich boat buyers purchased foreign or used vessels not subject to the tax . By decimating hundreds of small , family-owned boat manufacturing businesses , the luxury tax on boats will cost more money than it will raise for the Treasury . <p> Far from being the deadbeats painted by Burt Hoffman , boat owners are providing substantial revenue for the services they receive . Much of the Wallop-Breaux Trust Fund ( $ 203 million in 1992 ) , collected from taxes on motor-boat fuel sales , fishing tackle , tackle boxes , electric trolling motors and fish finders , is reverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sport fishing restoration and other services . <p> If critics of boaters want to see more Americans pay their fair share of taxes , there are 25,000 unemployed boat workers who would love to pay their income taxes to Uncle Sam instead of lining up to collect unemployment checks . <p>  --  John Breaux <p> The writer is a U.S. senator ( D-La . ) . <p> Burt Hoffman remarks that " a great hue and cry followed " the enactment of the user fee from boaters . Why should n't it ? It was a law railroaded through Congress in the middle of the night with no discussion , no representation and no notification . <p> Suppose the government , in all its infinite wisdom , passed a similar law in the middle of the night to levy a " user fee " on all electric golf carts in the United States at $ 25 to $ 100 a year . Would not golfers respond in kind ? I believe that the Senate and House recognize that what they did was unfair and wrong and want to rectify it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where does Hoffman get the notion that the monies collected by the U.S. Coast Guard will be funneled back into boating ? It wo n't . In a Sept. 11 letter to me , Sen. Barbara Mikulski writes : <p> " I believe that money raised from any ' user fee ' should go to funds which directly benefit the contributing user . What concerns me most about the Coast Guard ' user fee ' is that the money is actually going into the general fund to reduce the budget deficit , thus making this fee a tax . Marylanders who enjoy boating should not be singled out to pay for America 's budget deficit . " <p> For Hoffman to say , " There is no reason to eliminate either the fee or the tax , if anything , both should be increased , " just proved to me that he is way off course . Let 's hope that more level heads prevail and that Sen. John Breaux 's bill , S. 843 , passes and eliminates this unjust and unwarranted tax on a small segment of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
