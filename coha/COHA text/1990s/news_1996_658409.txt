<p> In a skyscraper town like New York , perhaps it was inevitable that even something as fleeting as dessert would follow suit : A towering pastiche of delicate sweets has ended many a meal in tony restaurants . <p> Yet while everyone around builds higher , pastry chef Maury Rubin 's signature desserts remain decidedly flat . <p> And flat is beautiful : Every four-inch tart is a perfect round of pastry , circling fillings such as chocolate custard , cranberries and almonds , and passion-fruit cream . Adornment is a mere chocolate thread or bead applied with a steady hand . If an urban aesthetic can be expressed in a dessert , Mr. Rubin has done just that . <p> Declaring a love for geometric designs and simplicity , Rubin is bucking the trends and establishing a minimalist style . Restaurant " architectural " desserts aside , his bakery 's signature tarts are a reaction against what the chef sees as a staleness in American pastry design . " Perhaps , " he muses in his " Book of Tarts , " " if the neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become nearly extinct . " <p> Overdecorated cakes and mountains of frosting are anathema to his less-is-more sensibility . Even the eye-catching , shiny glaze that frequently adorns bakery fruit tarts is eschewed . " Let the beauty and flavor of fresh fruit stand on their own , " Rubin suggests in a recipe . <p> At Rubin 's City Bakery , with its high white walls and stainless steel countertops , the atmosphere is not what you 'd call homey and inviting , but it is distinct and catching on . Austerity is acquiring a hipness in commercial design around town . Among his own inspirations Rubin includes architect Frank Lloyd Wright ; his taste in music leans toward jazz . <p> But Rubin understands that his vision of what 's " original and revelatory " will not be to everyone 's taste . And in the starkness of his visual approach , Rubin hopes customers do n't miss out on his sense of fun . " There is something about this , " Rubin says as he scans the bakery , greeting regulars with a hello , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He points out the honeycombed paper fruit that hang above a cash register as evidence of whimsy . " An important part of design here - for the pastry , for the bakery - is fun . " <p> For Rubin , fun extends to trademarking the name of one tart in his repertoire , the " World 's First Stuffed Raspberry Tart* . " " It represents how my work is different . It 's not just pretty things on top of each other - that 's just building . But putting chocolate inside a raspberry , that 's architecture . " He adds , " My next-door neighbor is a patent attorney . Maybe that 's where the inspiration came from . " <p> And while he did n't set out to make the popular four-inch tarts his signature , they did " lend themselves to being singled out , " Rubin says . " I like the idea of individual desserts . It 's a little bit indulgent , but I think dessert should be . " <p> Building a thriving business around indulgence requires that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recipes . The home baker who shies away from tarts and pastry because they are difficult to master should try Rubin 's way : The basic pastry dough is forgivingly designed to be repeatedly worked - heresy in traditional French formulas . " I was n't experienced enough to buy all the standard assumptions , " he says . <p> One in a line of food professionals who are practicing second careers , Rubin 's own resume includes a stint with Howard Cosell producing TV sports . Initiating his education in food with zealous , dedicated reading , Rubin then apprenticed in the patisseries of Paris . He returned home to the United States to discover that truly high quality was hard to find . And he wanted to apply the new American restaurateur 's ethic of fresh , local , seasonal ingredients to the operation of a bakery . His tarts contain this philosophy in being made of organic flour , farm-fresh cream , and fresh berries only when they flourish in the summer . <p> Steps from City Bakery , the Union Square farmers ' market dictates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apple and pear , chocolate and lemon creations dominate the offerings at the bakery . In the summer , Rubin says shopping the Greenmarket " is a totally exciting experience every time . " More inspiring produce begets more colorful tarts . <p> Talk turns to a recent Mondrian show he 's viewed , and it 's clear Rubin 's observations about art and design are inextricably linked to his work . Acknowledging a connection between his urban sensibilities and his style , Rubin says , " somehow all of that feeds into me and these lines and dots come out . " <p> Fruit Tarts With Lemon Cream <p> 1 cup granulated sugar <p> Grated zest of 1 lemon ( see first step ) <p> 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice <p> 4 large eggs <p> 1 large egg yolk <p> 12 tablespoons unsalted butter , cut into 6 pieces <p> 8 tart shells ( recipe follows ) <p> 2 cups cut-up assorted seasonal fruits and/or whole berries <p> Place the sugar in a medium bowl and grate the zest of 1 lemon into it . Rub the sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Strain the juice into a medium nonreactive saucepan . Add the eggs , egg yolk , butter , and the zested sugar , and whisk to combine . Set the pan over medium heat and cook , whisking constantly , for 3 to 5 minutes , or until the mixture begins to thicken . Be sure to whisk all over the bottom of the pan , especially the edges . At the first sign of a boil , remove from the heat and strain through a sieve into a bowl . <p> With a ladle or a large spoon , fill each tart shell nearly to the top with the lemon cream ; refrigerate leftover . Refrigerate tarts for 30 minutes or until set . Arrange the fruit in free-form patterns on the tops of the tarts . Serves 8 . <p> Tart Shells <p> This makes eight 4-inch tart shells , and can also be adapted for one large tart shell . Rubin suggests using 4-inch flan rings . They are easy-to-use , bottomless molds that can be set on a baking sheet . <p> 13 tablespoons unsalted butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar <p> 1 large egg yolk <p> 1-1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour <p> 1 tablespoon heavy cream <p> Let the butter sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes . It should be malleable but still cool . <p> Cream sugar and butter at medium speed until sugar is no longer visible . Add egg yolk and beat until well blended . Add half of the flour and beat until dough becomes crumbly . Add remaining flour and then the cream , and beat until the dough forms a sticky mass . <p> Shape the dough into a disk , and wrap well in plastic . Refrigerate until firm , about 2 hours . <p> Dust a work surface with flour . To work the dough , cut into 1-inch pieces . Using the heel of your hand , thoroughly knead the pieces and work back into one smooth disk . Use a dough scraper or knife to free the dough from the surface if necessary . Keeping the surface well-dusted , roll up the disk into a 12-inch log . Cut the log into 8 equal pieces . Wrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet with parchment paper and set the 8 flan rings on it . Dust the work surface and a rolling pin with flour . Using your fist , flatten one piece of dough into a 2- to-3-inch round . Lift it up off the work surface to dust underneath with flour . Roll the dough into a 5-1/2-inch round , about 1/8-inch thick . Prick holes all over the dough with a fork . ( If the dough is too soft to handle , use a dough scraper to move it to a small baking sheet and refrigerate for 2 to 3 minutes . ) <p> Center the round of dough over a flan ring . With your thumbs on the inside and the tips of your fingers outside , run your hands around the ring or pan several times , easing the dough down into it . Speed does not matter , finesse does . Lower your thumbs to the inside bottom of the ring and press to form a right angle between the bottom and sides of the dough . Keeping your thumbs on the inside of the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sides ; if you move the ring or pan around through your hands , the process will be easier . There should be at least a 1/2-inch rim of excess dough extending above the top edge . With a small knife tilted upwards , trim the excess dough flush with the top of the ring . Repeat this process with the remaining dough . ( Refrigerate the scraps as you work , then combine them and refrigerate or freeze for another use . ) <p> Place the tart shells in the freezer for 30 minutes . Position a rack in the center of the oven , and preheat to 375 degrees F. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes , or until golden brown . Remove the rings and , using a wide spatula , transfer the shells to a wire rack to cool . <p>  --  Adapted from " Book of Tarts , " by Maury Rubin ( William Morrow , 1995 )
