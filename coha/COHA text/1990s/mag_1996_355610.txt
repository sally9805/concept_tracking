In the current Broadway production of the King and I , the King of Siam , once played with electric virility by Yul Brynner , comes off as curiously sexless . Overt animal masculinity seems to have been suppressed , perhaps as being retrograde , or even offensive to the spirit of the age . That musky beast belongs offstage , or in the Museum of Natural History . <P> It is the same in the theater of politics . If we accidentally glimpse animal masculinity there  --  the Tasmanian devil of male desire  --  it is like stumbling upon secret squalor , the hand under the table , the old Packwood charm . A public exposure of the full horror of male desire sometimes leads to public relations catastrophes . On the other hand , Bill Clinton has shown that such storms can be weathered without noticeable damage . <P> The theater is filled these days with graphic homosexual stories . Gay sex interweaves a certain risque prestige with the drama of its poignant risk . But public male heterosexuality , like water seeking its own level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does its best to provide low entertainment . So we have hilariously unwholesome scenes in which , for example , the chief political strategist to the President of the U.S. is described as barking around an expensive Washington hotel suite on all fours . Besides that arresting scene , the story offers continuing suspense : Will Rover 's wife forgive him this untidiness ? Has she heard of the Invisible Fence ? <P> Every age has its styles of sex  --  and of infidelity . The Whig aristocracy of the 18th and 19th centuries pursued faithlessness with a sportive exuberance that called for tiptoeing up and down the corridors of country houses in the middle of the night . It was a style that John F. Kennedy , brought up under the influence of old Joe Kennedy 's dream of being a Whig aristocrat himself , imitated as energetically as he could . <P> But the class structure of J.F.K. 's adulteries was different ; philandering in an inclusive democracy , he wound up in the arms of women like Marilyn Monroe or Judith Exner , Sam Giancana 's girlfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as American as Hollywood and gangsters . <P> The U.S. succeeds where England fails . Aristocratic cross-pollination there suffered a steep devolution on the way to Charles and Diana . Bed hopping in country houses was probably never quite as careless or harmless as it seemed . Poor Lord Melbourne ( whose biography by David Cecil was J.F.K. 's favorite book ) suffered stoically for years while his ardent and unstable wife , Lady Caroline Lamb , made an idiot of herself with Lord Byron and others . But at least Melbourne , Lady Caroline and Byron were more interesting than Charles and Diana . Maybe Bill Clinton belongs to a more vigorous tradition of plebeian friskiness : Tom Jones transplanted to Arkansas . <P> There is always the winking Old World idea that adultery is an essentially victimless indulgence . At Francois Mitterrand 's graveside not long ago , the mistress mourned alongside the widow . Further , what was once considered the seed-scattering privileges of the seigneur may have yielded to the modern thought that reckless masculinity is characteristic of the risk-taking personality best suited to strong leadership . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
