Section : Articles The coup taught Western Sovietologists a valuable lesson : the Soviet Union was not a Western democracy . <p> TANKS in the streets , the general secretary held prisoner by his trusted aides , elite units of the KGB voting on whom to obey : if we had heard about any of this before , it was from paperback thrillers , not ( with a few exceptions ) , from Soviet specialists . The public relied on us during the years of perestroika to penetrate into a remote world , with odd jargon and unfamiliar structures , and prepare the public for unexpected events . But what the public heard ( for example , from the sophisticated and enormously learned Seweryn Bialer , two years ago ) was that There is no danger of an anti-Party group , a coalition of old-guard leaders , or Stalinists forming in the Politburo . ' Or again : The unquestionable existence of opposition to Gorbachev does not , however , constitute a real present danger to his leading position . The struggle at the top concerns the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . . . Gorbachev could face his own anti-Party ' group with a majority in the Politburo , as Khrushchev did in June 1957 . ' <p> These judgments about coups were founded on a broader Sovietological consensus that , as Gail Lapidus put it , . . . although the Soviet system confronts a set of major problems . . . the danger of destabilization is extremely remote . ' Professor Stephen Cohen of Princeton expressed this consensus in saying that , Put simply , the Soviet Union has become , both downstairs ' in society and upstairs ' in the political system , one of the most conservative countries in the world . ' Or as Jerome Gilison argued , contemporary Soviet society is built on a solid foundation of regime support . ' <p> How did our Sovietology take this wrong turn ? First , all of us were confused by the years during which the old nomenklatura had every motive to make a coup but did n't . In retrospect , we may not have taken seriously enough the Leninist doctrine of democratic centralism : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Politburo , and ultimately the General Secretary , because the Party must be united against its enemies . Gorbachev clearly exploited democratic centralism to force the Party apparatus to accept his drastic changes . But democratic centralism also implies that if a consensus ever forms within the upper echelons of the Party that the General Secretary no longer represents it , that he is himself the enemy , the Party must unite against him . This seems to have happened to Khrushchev in 1964 and to Gorbachev in 1991 . If so , our error was to be too practical , too realistic , ' by discounting ideas and the distinctive subculture of Bolshevism . <p> Second , Sovietology did not pay enough attention to the disintegration of the state ( that is , of higher officials ' authority and lower officials ' loyalty ) during the years of perestroika . The coup happened because the KGB and military leaders no longer obeyed their legal commander-in-chief , Gorbachev ; it fell apart because they , in turn , were not obeyed by many lower officers . This disintegration of the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , although we could have grasped it from history . It was the theme of conservative historians such as David Hume and Hippolyte Taine , but not of modern political science . Modern political science is affected by the liberal politics of most of its practictioners . For modern liberalism , far-reaching protest and change can be let loose without ever threatening the legitimacy of the existing state or the habits of obedience to law and respect for the public good . Liberal judicial activism , for example , continually changes the meaning of the Constitution without worrying that this will damage respect for the Constitution . American liberals were thus optimistic about the prospects of Gorbachev 's kindred project , a revolution within the Revolution . ' They assumed that you can bend law and custom indefinitely without breaking it . Gorbachev found out otherwise . <p> Third , we somehow managed to overlook the obvious likelihood that the advocates of democracy and the market would want to repudiate the old system , Communism or socialism , ' and that the ruling class , which owed all its privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to save it . By 1991 the means available were the KGB , the MVD , and the army . Instead , the bulk of the foreign-policy elite believed ( with the Bush Administration ) that a defiantly distinctive system of government could quietly but quickly change into the precise opposite system that it had derided every day for seventy years . The conventional wisdom further assumed that the ruler of the first system , the authoritative source of its ideology , could manage the transition to the new order while remaining its leader : as though Louis XVI had survived the collapse of the monarchy , the aristocracy , and the Church to go on as the foremost Jacobin leader . To state this assumption is to expose its extreme implausibility . The alternative assumption  --  that different social-political systems and their advocates would clash violently  --  seems , in contrast , to be simple common sense . Mass Delusion <p> Throughout the years of perestroika we seem to have been in the grip of some sort of mass delusion that paralyzed common sense : specifically , the common-sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political experience begins with the distinction between the experience of ruling ourselves ( once called republican government ) and that of being ruled by others . On this basis there is a common-sense distinction between democracy , oligarchy , and one-man rule , whether legitimate ( monarchy ) or illegitimate ( dictatorship ) . Through the first 150 or so years of American history , self-rule or liberty ' was the goal of politics , the loss of liberty the great fear . But now all these distinctions have been blurred . We do not think of liberty as something that can be lost , and we have the belief ( fortified by some cases such as the evolution of Spain after Franco ) that dictatorship and democracy mingle and evolve into each other . <p> The excuse for this great transformation has been social science . As a fellow graduate student in comparative politics once impatiently explained to me , if we say an apple and an orange are different , we are not comparing ' them ; we compare them only by saying that each is a fruit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Jerry Hough has expressed it , . . . there is not . . . there can not be  --  a society in which all power is concentrated in a few hands and in which the broad population has none . ' Hough was writing about the Stalin case . ' The specific social-science concept that has been used to legitimize many dictatorships ( Communist and non-Communist ) is political participation . ' Citizen participation ' in politics , for our social science , occurs not only through free elections but through interest groups , the media , bureaucracy ( higher officials represent ' lower officials ) , or even attendance at rallies organized by the Communist Party . By this standard , as Hough wrote in 1977 , the Soviet system is a very participatory one . ' <p> If social science was the excuse for blurring the distinctions among regimes , the energy came from politics . Beginning in the Sixties , under the influence of Vietnam , American and British Sovietology underwent a transformation whose goals are nakedly obvious in this remark by Susan Gross Solomon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics and Soviet studies would have accomplished two objectives . First , it would have demonstrated more forcefully than any argument that the Soviet Union was not an outsider in the family of nations , a pariah . And , in destigmatizing the Soviet system , it would have moved specialists on Soviet politics more squarely into the mainstream of the discipline of political science . <p> The flight from the cold war and the totalitarian model sparked a hunt for the Soviet analogies of Western democratic institutions and practices . To take some examples almost at random , two careful British Sovietologists ( Ronald J. Hill and Peter Frank ) conclude that To reject , as the writers in the 1950s did , all single parties as not really ' being parties is to follow the road to intellectual bankruptcy . . . the world has moved on , . . . and new types of political systems , with fresh forms of institutions , have come into being . It is the task of political science to accommodate these forms into an enriched theory . . . ' Jerome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leadership of the British parties and the Soviet party strive for the same sort of democracy within the party . ' As Gilison says in conclusion , one of the main themes of this book has been the underlying similarities of the British and Soviet systems of government . ' <p> This school of thought was fueled not only by politics , but by some real defects of the totalitarian model and by a generous instinct of tolerance . It made some real discoveries about the Soviet system . Nevertheless , taken as a total framework it was massively misleading , and it did not prepare us for the surprises since 1985 . <p> Nowhere was our Sovietology 's prudery about the distinctiveness of Soviet Communism greater than in approaching the role of coups d'etat , of force , of the KGB , and of the army in Soviet politics . These modes of political struggle are utterly beyond the horizon of British or American politics ; they seem to belong not to politics but to fantasy , to fiction . To show that the USSR was a normal state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from politics . <p> This our Sovietology had done , until Mikhail Gorbachev was held prisoner by the KGB last month . In 1986 Bialer pronounced it one of the most important characteristics of the present Soviet system that the secret police has been largely eliminated from the political process within the elite . ' Peter Hauslohner , brought from Yale into the Bush Administration as the State Department 's Soviet specialist , attributes the KGB 's apparent lack of interest in domestic politics to its rising professionalism . . . . As for the military , there is , again , more evidence of strong political control than of its weakness or absence . ' Soviet history was rewritten to blur at least four coups d'etat ( non-constitutional selections of leaders involving access to force ) since Stalin 's death ( March 1953 , June 1953 , June 1957 , October 1964 ) . We now have an account from the KGB Chairman himself , V. E. Semichastny , of the 1964 conspiracy against Khrushchev : When we came to Kosygin a week beforehand , his first question was How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we were part of this , he said , I agree . ' ' Subsequently , the KGB mounted a massive campaign of blackmail and , perhaps , intimidation to secure the position of General Secretary for its chairman , Yuri Andropov , and then for his chosen heir , Mikhail Gorbachev . We have the testimony of Yegor Ligachev that Gorbachev could not have become General Secretary without the support of Chebrikov , chairman of the KGB . Indeed , the KGB was so dangerous to Gorbachev precisely because , relying on it against his rivals , he left it as the only major institution whose leadership he never purged . We know the sequel . Through the years when the role of the political police was growing toward its recent climax , our Sovietology was trying to assimilate its role in leadership politics to that of Western police agencies ; in 1985 Hough compared it to the FBI . Something Fishy <p> So often our Sovietology has set out to discover Soviet reality , and come back having discovered once again Western politics . It gives one a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our times . We roamed the universe with our technology and our powerful methodologies and saw only ourselves . When we see another nation feverishly piling up arms , it turns out to be because we were doing it ( the arms race ' ' ) ; if the Sandinistas hate us , or if Pol Pot is exterminating his own people ( in Shawcross 's Sideshow ) , it is only because we were mean to them . Even in my childhood , it was different . My parents and their coevals were gripped , half in horror and half in fascination , by the imminent arrival of the Unknown . Your neighbors act just a little strange ; it turns out their bodies have been occupied by aliens and the town you grew up in is now the center from which they are at this moment taking over the earth . At the beach you have just a moment 's surmise  --  Do you smell something fishy ? '  --  before it 's here : the Creature from the Black Lagoon ! In the serious world of scholarship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gripped by the hunch that they would uncover a secret , something strange and fascinating . For some reason , what we now want to discover is the opposite . We want to be bored . Perhaps future civilizations will regard this as the particular feeling that distinguished our civilization from all the others . Some civilizations were serenely cradled in their own traditional ways ; others restlessly explored the unknown in their yearning for excitement . Ours is probably the first that made boredom the object of craving . <p> Cartoon : HANDELSMAN <p> By CHARLES FAIRBANKS <p> <p> Mr. Fairbanks , a research professor of international relations at the Nitze School of International Studies , was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration .
