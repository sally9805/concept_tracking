Caught in a whirlwind of work , school and social activities , it 's not easy to find the time to eat right and keep fit . While 20 years ago the family dinner was a daily ritual , today a trip to a fast-food restaurant on the way to skating practice happens more often than many parents want to admit . Experts agree , North Americans eat too much fat . Recent statistics cite that 20 percent of Canadian children are overweight due to too little exercise and high-fat diets . While dietitians and paediatricians point out that children under two years of age should never have fat restricted in their diet  --  the under-twos need fat in order to grow-their opinions vary widely about whether or not older children should . In 1993 , Health Canada , in conjunction with the Canadian Paediatric Society , created a guideline stipulating that the fat intake of children over two should gradually decrease to the adult level ( where 30 percent of calories should come from fat ) by age 18 . The safest bet is to discuss any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or your doctor . For the cook , the best thing about a low-fat meal is that it can be put together quickly . Because light cuisine features fresh vegetables , grains and small portions of chicken or meat sans heavy sauces , these meals are simple to orchestrate and often quick to cook . A few tools such as a non-stick pan and a steamer basket can make a big difference in cutting fat from a recipe . There are also lots of little things you can do to make the transition to a lower-fat diet easier on your family : Try adapting favourite recipes by cutting back on the amount of cheese in one dish or by baking or grilling meat instead of frying . Introduce new foods gradually by combining something familiar with something new  --  for example , try making your favourite spaghetti sauce with white kidney beans instead of ground meat . Arm your kids with a few health-conscious cookbooks ( such as the ones listed as Resources on page 134 ) , and involve them in meal planning by letting them pick out recipes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible fat from meat and take the skin off chicken . Lower-fat cuts of meat tend to be tougher , so try marinating them in garlic , herbs , lemon juice or wine to make them more tender . Lighten up recipes by choosing lower-fat ingredients like yogurt instead of sour cream . But watch those labels carefully . Some so-called light products might be light in name only . For example , light olive oil refers only to the taste and colour ; it has the same amount of calories as regular olive oil .

Anna 's Angel Food Cake Angel food cake is old-fashioned and delicious , yet it contains virtually no fat . The cake freezes well , and you can serve it with the berry sauce or with plain fresh fruit , sweetened yogurt or sorbet . You should use a traditional tube or angel food cake pan , and remember that the whole trick to making a high , light angel cake is to beat the egg whites properly . 1 1/2 cups ( 375 mL ) granulated sugar , divided 1 cup ( 250 mL ) cake and pastry flour 2 cups ( 500 mL ) egg whites ( 12 to 16 whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 tbsp.

With electric mixer , beat egg whites with cream of tartar and lemon juice on medium speed until " loosened . " Continue to beat at medium-high until light . Slowly add remaining 3/4 cup ( 175 mL ) sugar , beating constantly . Egg whites should be very light and stiff . Beat in vanilla . Stir in peel . Gently mix or fold in flour mixture in three additions . Do not overfold so as not to deflate egg whites . Very delicately spoon or pour batter into 10-inch ( 4 L ) tube pan . Bake cake in preheated 375F ( 190C ) oven for 35 to 45 minutes , or until toothpick comes out clean and dry and top of cake springs back when lightly touched . Cool cake in pan upside down ( if pan does not have little feet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so air can circulate underneath ) . To remove cake from pan , use long , thin knife to loosen edges . If pan has removable bottom , remove sides and then loosen bottom with knife . If you are using a one-piece pan , use spatula or knife to loosen bottom . Do not worry if cake seems crushed  --  it usually springs back into shape . Makes 12 to 16 servings .
