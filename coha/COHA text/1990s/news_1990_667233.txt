<p> Housing starts took another battering in October , setting a record with a nine-month losing streak . Construction of houses and apartments hit its lowest level since the 1981-82 recession . " The numbers are really terrible , " says Barbara Allen , analyst at Kidder Peabody in New York . " How can anyone avoid saying we 're in a recession ? " <p> The housing industry 's recession , at least , has been building for years . Analysts are scrambling to decide if this year 's grim housing data point to cyclical indigestion or a long-term ailment that could go to the heart of the economy . <p> The numbers the Commerce Department published Tuesday are n't encouraging . Never in the 31 years that the department has tracked construction had there been nine consecutive monthly declines in starts . And never had the annualized pace of apartment construction dropped as low as 187,000 , as it did in October - a 23.4% drop in one month . - The remaining numbers are n't record breakers , but they are n't the stuff of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - counting houses and apartments , - fell in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 million , down 6% from September 's rate . <p> - Starts of single-family homes fell 1% to an annualized pace of 902,000 , the lowest rate since June 1982 . <p> - For the first 10 months of this year , total starts slumped more than 12% from the 1989 pace . <p> Builders blame the slump on stingy lending practices , but many experts see more fundamental causes : <p> - A crisis in affordability and confidence is quashing demand for single- family homes . <p> The weakening economy and the Persian Gulf crisis are just part of the bad news for housing . Potential first-time buyers have been losing ground against inflation for years . <p> " There is an earnings crunch , not a credit crunch , " says Gerald Celente , author of Trend Tracking . Between 1973 and 1986 , the real income of families headed by someone younger than 30 fell 26% , says Celente . " That 's as much as personal income fell between 1929 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incomes to pay for houses now , and they do n't have the confidence to go down and put out a big down payment , " says Stephen Grant , home-building-industry analyst at Value Line Inc. in New York . <p> Michael Carliner , economist at the National Association of Home Builders , says , " The income of people in the first-time-home-buyer age has not gone up as much as income overall . " For example , he says , 30-year-olds now make about 75% as much as 40-year-olds . In 1970 , it was 90% . Result : First-time buyers are taking much longer to save for a home . That keeps current homeowners from trading up . <p> - The screeching halt in apartment construction is largely the aftermath of an unrivaled building binge . <p> Carliner says the rental market is so glutted , builders could put away their bulldozers for two years before most parts of the country would even notice that the engine was shut off . The rental-vacancy rate in the third quarter stood at 7.2% . The rule of thumb is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a profit , Carliner says . <p> A glut was sparked by tax laws in the early ' 80s that encouraged investment in real estate - regardless of demand . The bust began when the 1986 tax overhaul took away the incentives for investing in unprofitable buildings . It intensified this year when the Department of Housing and Urban Development began requiring builders to make apartments accessible to handicapped people - a costly proposition . The last straw : Because of the sagging market and rise in loan defaults , no one wants to lend for apartment building . <p> The near-term outlook for housing and the economy : more of the same . Martin Regalia , chief economist at the National Council of Savings Institutions , notes that building permits in October fell 6.8% from September to 925,000 , also the lowest since June 1982 . " On the single-family side , I think the erosion will continue , but I do n't think it will get to the recession levels of 1981-82 , " he says . In those years , when mortgage rates soared to above 18% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 700,000 . <p> But many are more hopeful about the single-family market . " We 've seen the slide basically that we are going to have , " says John Weicher , assistant HUD secretary for policy development and research . " Interest rates are coming down . Starts will bottom out and start moving up . " <p> Adds Norman Robertson , chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp . in Pittsburgh : " Home-building activity should not be a further drag on the economy in 1991 . But ... there 's also no likelihood of a significant pickup in housing , either . " <p> The big question : What will happen later this decade ? <p> The doom-and-gloom camp sees an ever-shrinking pool of home buyers - largely the result of slowing household formation and lower earning power . Celente says single-parent families , typically the poorest households , are becoming a bigger segment of the population . Younger people are earning less . And most baby boomers already have purchased homes . All that spells trouble for housing . <p> Among the more upbeat is Kidder Peabody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happens every few years . Every time it happens , everybody says , ' No one will respond to lower interest rates . ' And every time , they do . This time is no different . " In fact , Allen sees a wave of pent-up demand among 25- to 39-year-olds . Traditionally , she says , 45% to 50% of the people in that age group own their homes . Today , the ratio is 35% to 40% . As the group ages , it will get wealthier . " If interest rates recede , particularly if you get 9% interest rates , then you 'll see a lot of positive response from those people . " <p> Even so , few are predicting a return to the boom days , when rapid household growth could absorb 2 million new homes a year . That means slower growth in the overall economy . The rule of thumb is that every dollar of housing generates $ 4 of spending . During the ' 80s , the housing boom was a powerful engine for the economy . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ' 80s wo n't do so in the ' 90s , " says Robertson . " Housing is among those " - along with consumer spending and defense spending . " We 'll see it pick up in a year or two to an annual average of 1.4 million or 1.5 million starts . But it 's not going to get back to 1.7 million or 2 million in the ' 90s .
