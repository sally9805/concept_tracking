Carrie Richerson 's last appearance in these pages was with " The Harrowing " last December . Here she offers a tale not for the faint of heart , but then how often does the truth honor faint hearts ? And how often do the dead honor the wishes of faint-hearted people-or anyone 's ? <p> MY BROTHER FRANK CAME home tonight . Mother and I were just sitting down to Thanksgiving dinner , my first at home in years , when the doorbell rang . I flipped on the porch light , threw open the door and saw him standing there . Seven years in the grave had not been kind . A whiff of rot crept in under the formaldehyde ; the skin that had looked like shiny plastic under the tasteful lighting of the funeral home now showed small cracks and flakes like badly glazed pottery . His wild red hair had become stringy and colorless , and the blue suit we 'd buried him in , the one that he had so outgrown that his wrists stuck way out the cuffs and the undertaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit over his wide-receiver shoulders , hung loosely on his shrunken frame . " Hello , Jenny , " he said . " You sorry son-of-a-bitch , " I said , and slammed the door in his face . As an afterthought , I turned off the porch light . Mother was lighting the candles when I returned to the dining room . Losing first her husband , then her son , had spurred her to cling to the comforts of tradition . I understood her little rituals , but had no desire to share them . College had allowed me to escape , but this year , my first in med school , some charitable impulse had moved me to give in to the hopeful , lonely note in her voice when she called and asked if I were planning to come home to Gulfport for the holiday . Now the trappings of a traditional turkey dinner , bowls and platters of too much food , littered the table ; absurd for just the two of us . At least she had cooked a small bird instead of an eighteen-pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breezing past her into the kitchen . I found the bourbon right where I expected , and returned to the dining table with the bottle and two glasses . Mother declined ; I ignored her frown of disapproval and buried my nose in my tumbler . The bouquet was almost sweet enough to take the smell of Frank out of my nostrils . I drank and watched Mother carve the turkey . It shocked me to see how old she looked . I remembered a younger woman , laugh wrinkles at the corners of her eyes , playing ball in the backyard with Dad , Frank , and me . Before Dad died when I was six , Frank nine . Before Frank died at eighteen , seven years ago . Now the candlelight highlighted those wrinkles , spreading their seams over her whole face , and picked out more gray than red in her curls . She was one of those women who had grown thinner , more intense , more brittle with age . I was probably looking at my own face , a quartercentury down the line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the thought , as if on cue , the doorbell went off again . " I 'll get it , " I said , popping up . Damn that brother of mine . He stood on the step with a patience he 'd never displayed in life . Frank had hurtled through the world , and into death , lingering just long enough after the accident for Mother to make the agonizing decision to donate his perfect blue eyes ( her own blue eyes ) to the Lions Club Eye Bank . Morbidly curious , I had asked the funeral director at the viewing why the closed eyes did n't look sunken ; he had explained gently about glass eyeballs used to provide a natural contour to the face . What he had n't explained was that , since there was no need , the glass had n't been painted to resemble a real eye . Blank white balls stared back at me from Frank 's sockets . How did he see ? I wondered . " What do you want , Frank ? Ca n't you just leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Let me in , Jenny . I have to come in . " Not " I want " but " I have to . " No one knows what cosmic injunction the dead are following by getting up out of their graves and returning to their families , but everyone knows by now that it 's not a matter subject to negotiation . I raised my hand to an uncaring Heaven . " C'm on , God . How about a lightning bolt-just a little one-to incinerate this maggoty lump that used to be my brother ? " But God is asleep at the switch , or maybe dead Himself . No help there . The dead have no sense of humor . Frank waited just long enough to see if my prayer would be answered , then stepped forward over the threshold . I put out a hand to block him . His broken chest felt spongy under the suit . " I do n't want you here , Frank . Stay away from me . If you come near me , I 'll .... " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " He was n't defiant , or angry , or contemptuous . The dead do n't need to be any of those things . They are just indestructibly persistent , and they always get their way , whatever it is , sooner or later . Mother looked up , a slice of breast meat pinned unmercifully between knifeblade and fork , and froze , the color draining from her face to leave her as ashen as Frank . I took the serving utensils out of her hands before she could drop them , and pressed her into the chair . I grabbed the liquor bottle and poured , then put her trembling hands around the glass . She drank . She never took her eyes off Frank 's face . " Hello , Mother , " he said from the doorway . She stopped shaking , as though a switch had been flipped somewhere . She pushed the whiskey away , walked to Frank and embraced him . " My darling baby boy . I 'm so glad you 're home . Come sit down , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling it out for him . " You , too , Jenny , " she ordered , indicating the chair across from Frank 's . She began briskly serving up dressing , gravy , vegetables . Frank and I stared at each other over the mounting piles on our plates . The smell of hot roast meat clashed with the odor of preservatives and decay . Bile rushed into my mouth . " I 'm afraid I 'm not very hungry , Mom , " I said brightly , folding my napkin beside my plate . " I 'm sure you two have lots to talk about . See you in the morning . " I scooped up the bourbon and my glass and fled upstairs . Mother sent a vague " Good night , dear " after me ; she was already digging into her dinner with gusto and briefing Frank on seven years " worth of neighborhood gossip . MOTHER HAD changed nothing about my old room except to keep it cleaner than I ever had . I settled onto the bed with a full tumbler at my elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night the cheery optimism of the March girls could n't captivate me . After a while I gave up the pretense and set the book aside . Then I got up and did something I had n't done in years : I locked the door . The level in the bottle dropped slowly and steadily . When I felt I had achieved the perfect state of pleasant numbness , I switched off the light and tried to spin myself down into dreamless dark . It did n't work . I was almost there when some reflex twitched and I was wide awake , panting , my eyes straining up into the darkness . Not a nightmare , no - a knowledge , a conviction . The certainty that Frank lay in the bed next to me , that his hollow head depressed the pillow next to my cheek , that if I had but the courage to turn my head , I would meet his white stare eyeball to eyeball . I listened to my heart hammer and I could n't do it . And then suddenly I did : my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a dent in the pillow or a ruffle in the sheets . Of course he could n't get in . I had locked the door , had n't I ? I got up and checked it , then lay back down , this time on my side facing the empty half of the bed . Now I had only to open my eyes to reassure myself that he was n't there , to avoid that terrifying paralysis of will . An itch grew between my shoulderblades . He had come into the room silently , behind my back , past the faithless lock , and he was staring at me . I could feel his gaze on me like a touch - a slow , persistent , insistent touch . I rolled over , thrashing out from under the covers . No Frank . Door still locked . But no way was I going to get to sleep . I sat up with my back to the headboard , bottle locked between my shins , the glass my first line of defense . I drank until gray light started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head on my knees . I woke stiff , hung-over , and with an urgent need to pee . I almost twisted the doorknob off the door before I remembered that it was locked , and why . A shower , mouthwash , and clean clothes made me feel marginally functional again . I headed downstairs with a swollen head and a bad attitude . Frank and Mother were just finishing breakfast . Or rather , Mother was . Frank 's scrambled eggs and bacon were untouched . He was sitting in my chair , the one on Mother 's right , wearing some of Dad 's old clothes . They fit him a little better than the blue suit . " Good morning , dear , " Mother said . " I hope you slept well . " Frank got up silently and walked around the table to the place on Mother 's left . " You can have that chair , Jenny . I know it 's your favorite . And the food . I do n't need to eat , " he said . I looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anatomy lab always felt greasy , their leathery skins coated with a thin film of fat dissolved by the formaldehyde . I imagined an oil slick on the chair seat . That , and the smell of Frank and the food almost completed the job on my stomach . Dry toast , I thought . I can handle dry toast . I fixed myself a hangover special in the kitchen and chose a chair at the far end of the table from Mother and Frank . Mother looked hurt , but said nothing . " So tell us , Frank , " I said around a mouthful of crumbs , " why 'd you come back ? I heard it was only murder victims that were returning from the dead . But nobody killed you , Frank - you wrapped your car around that light pole all by yourself , right ? " " It was an accident , " he said . I contemplated his hands , resting passively on the tablecloth . I had dissected hands . I thought about muscles , tendons , nerves , vessels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I dissected his hands here , on the dining table , would he feel anything ? Would I ? " You were drunk , were n't you , Frank ? " I pressed . " Yes , I was drunk . " " And it 's just a miracle that you did n't kill someone else that night , is n't it ? " I was beginning to enjoy this . " I should not have been driving , " he agreed . Mother 's distress with the turn the conversation was taking was apparent . " Jenny , we do n't need to dwell on the past . " But I refused to back off . " So , Frank - you were n't murdered , nobody ran you off the road - why are you here ? " He aimed those white balls straight at me . " For justice , Jenny . So justice can be done . " " What justice , Frank ? Whose version of justice ? " " That 's enough ! " Mother 's voice was shrill . I held my breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control and continued in a brighter tone , " Why do n't the three of us do something special today ? We could go to a movie - Oh , it 's so nice to have the family together again ! " Family ? This ? I choked down the last of my juice and hoped it would n't come right back up . " Sorry , Mom , " I lied , " I promised some friends I 'd drop by today . Got ta run . " I spun my car out of the driveway without bothering to look and picked a direction at random . The driving calmed me quickly . I 've always felt safe in my car : late at night , drunk , high , driving through the worst neighborhoods or the ass-end of nowhere . I 've taken some awful chances behind the wheel , but nothing can touch me . No one can touch me . I meandered north through town and up U.S. 49 as far as DeSoto National Forest , then followed county roads and bayous past faux antebellum homes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Across the causeway into historic Biloxi , then a slow cruise along the beach on Highway 90 back to Gulfport . I drove past the cemetery , but I did n't go in to check Frank 's spot in the family vault . I 'd never visited it since the funeral ; why start now ? By mid-afternoon I felt I could handle real food . I bought a shrimp po " boy and a six-pack at a deli , parked my car at the end of the airport runway , and watched the National Guard fighter pilots practice touchand-go 's while I ate . Frank had wanted to be a pilot ; he had the eyesight and the steady nerves for it . The NROTC scholarship to Ole Miss had come through the week before he died . The sandwich stayed down , thanks to the beers . When one of the pop tabs broke off in my fingers , I used the Swiss Army knife I keep in the car to open the can . Soon I had a pleasant buzz on . Mild air and late autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt sandpapered . I 'll just rest them for a minute , I thought as I leaned back in the seat . Even the scream of the jets could n't keep me awake . Screaming . Someone was screaming . was screaming . It was dark , I was frightened , and I was screaming my outrage and fear at the top of my lungs . Please . Do n't . Frank and I had been playing Monopoly in the basement while Mom visited the Truetts next door for Sunday afternoon coffee . Some petty squabble over real estate had mushroomed into name-calling and shouting , and suddenly Frank had dashed up the steps and slammed the door behind him . The lock snicked , then the lights went out . Seven-year-old logic was no match for the monsters my imagination could create to populate the darkness . Things were watching me , breathing on me , touching me . Panic burst from me in full-throated screams . Then suddenly there was light , and Frank hugging me hard . " I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry - Oh god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , now - stop crying please do n't tell Mom - it 's okay , now - stop crying . " Over and over , until my screams died away and I realized I was safe . " That 's right - quiet now - you 're okay - look , I 've got something to show you . " " Show me again , " I demanded . An earlier memory now . Christmas afternoon , Frank and I on the back steps , Mom and Dad and the Truetts watching football games on TV . I was - what ? Five ? I adored my big brother . As far as I was concerned , Frank had hung the moon and set all the stars in the sky , just for me . Now I crowded close , shoulder to shoulder with him in the watery December light , and oohed and ahhed as he showed off the Swiss Army knife Dad had given him . The knife blossomed under Frank 's fingers like a steel flower . Two blades , a bottle opener with screwdriver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A corkscrew and a magnifier . From the other side , an awl , fishscaler , nail file , and , incredibly , tiny scissors . Stuck into a clever slot in the end , a toothpick and a tweezer . Everything open , displayed . The knife bristled , armed for bear . One by one , Frank closed , settled , inserted , until the miraculous package lay quiescent on his palm . It was my first experience with folded space . A fat bar of metal and red plastic , a white cross . How could all that fit in there ? " Again , " I urged . " Naw , you 've seen enough . " I reached for it , but he pulled his hand away . " No , you 're too young to play with a knife like this . You 'd hurt yourself , and Dad would have my hide . " " Would not ! " But Frank was n't listening . His eyes had gone remote at the thought of Dad 's temper . He rolled the knife back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a fist . The winter air was suddenly chill ; I tried not to move or breathe or make a sound . Please . Do n't . Frank took a deep breath and a door opened somewhere behind his eyes . Tucking the knife away in his jacket pocket , he gave me a sunny smile . " You can play with things like this when you 're older . " " You 're old enough to know about things like this now , Jenny . Bet you and your girlfriends talk about it all the time . " I was scared and fascinated at the same time . Of course I knew I should n't be doing this , Mom would have a shitfit if she found us under the basement stairs like this - but the lure of forbidden knowledge was stronger than prohibition . And it could n't hurt to just look , could it ? Frank wanted me to look . And when I had looked , he encouraged me to touch it . Hesitantly I reached out a finger . The soft texture surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder and larger . I was n't sure I liked this lesson in folded space . I pulled my hand away and edged back toward the closet door . " Do n't stop . It 's okay , it wo n't bite . " He took my hand and put it back around his erection . " Like this - and this , " he guided me . He was my brother . What could it hurt ? And I was full of an elevenyear-old 's natural curiosity . I did what he asked , until he grunted and wetness filled my palm . " Gross ! " But I remembered to whisper . " No , it 's not . It 's normal . Just wait a few years - you wo n't be able to get enough of it . " He wiped my hand and himself with a handkerchief , then buttoned himself back up . I doubted his prognostication . Who would want to have that sticky stuff on them all the time ? Were grown-ups weird , or what ? " Now show me yours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know that would be the deal when he had called me into the dark space under the stairs and offered to show me something special . " I do n't want to , " I said . His hand closed like a trap around my wrist . " Do it , Jenny . " He began to squeeze . " I showed you mine . " " Okay , darn it ! " I rubbed the wrist he 'd released , then pulled down my shorts and underpants . He lifted my shirtfront , touched the swells of my growing breasts , then lower . I was still unsure about the changes my body was beginning to undertake , very self-conscious about the seemingly huge growths on my chest and the sprouting forest of hair between my thighs . I expected taunts , but instead he said , " You 're going to be a beautiful woman , Jenny . " His touch was gentle , pleasurable . As if reading my mind , he said , " You touch yourself at night , do n't you , Jenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's okay , " he said , stroking lower . " Everyone does it . Show me how you do it . " He was my brother . It was n't like he was some grotty pervert hanging around the school playground , trying to get me into his car . I guided his fingers . I was still developing this skill , and he was clumsy , but after a few minutes , a tiny spasm throbbed through my groin . I must have breathed funny , because Frank knew . He stopped rubbing , then let his fingers explore further back in my slickness . He found the opening of my vagina and tried to press his finger inside . " Ow ! No ! " I slapped his hand away . " Do n't do that ! " I did n't think what we 'd done so far was all that bad though Mom would undoubtedly disagree if she found out - mothers were like that ) , but I knew that opening had to do with making babies . And that , I knew , was Trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That time . Later , other times , times he broadened his sexual experimentations , he was n't so accommodating . Please , do n't , I lay in the dark and begged him . But he always did , anyway . I lay in the dark and held my breath , listening to the bedroom door 's bolt strain against the frame . I could imagine Frank 's large , strong hand twisting the knob , twisting it as he sometimes twisted my wrists when I would n't cooperate . Fifteen years old , and putting all my trust in a fragile piece of metal . I lay in the dark and waited for the faithless lock to snap , as I sometimes waited for my wrists to snap . But the lock held . After a few moments I heard Frank release the knob , then his soft steps padding away down the hall . All the air left me with a whoosh , and I started to shiver violently , freezing and sweating by turns , all the bedclothes pulled tight around me . When my body was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most restful sleep I 'd had in years . I slept so late the next morning that I had to skip breakfast to get to school on time . Frank had already left ; I was glad I did n't have to face him . I bought a banana at the Kwik-Pik to hold me until lunch and peeled it as I headed round the corner at a trot . I never saw what hit me . Purple clouds in a pink sky . Green clouds in an orange sky . Then Frank 's face swam into view ; he grabbed my arm and hauled me to my feet . My mouth felt funny ; I thought I had mashed banana all over it , but when I touched it , my fingers came away red . I blinked at the blood as if I had never seen the color before . Frank shook me , hard . My head snapped up and down as I tried to focus on his face . " Do n't you ever do that again , you hear me ? " I tried to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about was how much Frank 's voice sounded like Dad 's . Frank shook me again . " If you ever lock your door again - I 'll kill you , jenny . Understand ? " He let me go . My rubbery legs folded up beneath me and I sat down hard . " Clean yourself up , " he said , throwing his handkerchief into my lap . I heard his boots crunching across the gravel as I stared stupidly at the dark drops falling onto my skirt . I do n't remember what excuse I gave the school office for my split lip and my stained clothing , but I remember that I was very late . The telephone call came very late . on a Friday night . At the hospital the doctors told us the impact had crushed Frank 's chest and ruptured most of his organs . They pumped sixty-eight units of blood into him , and it all ran right back out . He died on the table , while the surgeons worked frantically to restore the proper configurations of his folded spaces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unscathed . Mother kissed him one last time , and told the doctors to take his eyes . Then she finally surrendered herself to a terrible grief . What did I feel ? I felt like I 'd had all the wind knocked out of me . I felt scared . I felt relieved . I felt guilty . I felt all alone . I felt nothing at all . I 'll tell you how I felt : I felt free . And safe . Safe . I WOKE SO suddenly that I banged my head against the car roof . The sun had set while I napped and the warm afternoon had turned into a chilly evening , but I was shivering from more than the cold as I rolled up the window and started the engine . I had never buried the memory of Frank 's abuses the way some people do to survive , but I did n't like to remember them . The pain ran too deep . The afternoon 's dreams had been as sharp , as vivid , as hurtful as the original experiences ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house was dark and deserted when I returned . Maybe Mother and Frank were still at the movies . With a pair of dark glasses , Frank probably looked no worse than any other hung-over holiday reveler . In the darkened theater who would know that there was a dead man in the next seat ? Maybe many of the risen dead and their families had gone to the movies today . I pictured rows of impassive faces glowing a spectral blue in the light reflected from the screen . Which is the living here and which the dead ? I recognized the edge of hysteria in my muddled thoughts . I needed sleep , dreamless sleep - something alcohol could n't give me . But it 's not very difficult for a medical student to get what she needs . I locked the bedroom door and dug into the bottom of my overnight bag . The pill went down with a slug of whiskey and , a few minutes later , I went down the rabbit hole after it . I slept the clock around to the next afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house . Where could Mother and Frank be now ? There was enough of the turkey left to make a decent-sized sandwich , and a fresh pan of Mother 's famous brownies sat on the back of the stove . I took my dinner into the living room and settled into a comfortable chair with the bourbon at my elbow . Some perverse impulse made me pick up the family picture album and leaf through it as I ate . Here was Dad , grinning and holding up a large Spanish mackerel after a successful Gulf fishing trip , and I , scarcely taller than the fish , struggling to lift its tail . A picture of me as a three-year-old , toddling after Dad with an armload of grass runners to plant in the bare earth of our new back yard when we had first moved to this house . Frank helping Mom and Dad plant azaleas while I operated the hose , watering bushes and workers indiscriminately . Frank at eight and me at five , dressed in our new Easter outfits , my hair in long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully slicked-down hair starting to escape into his usual cowlick . His arm was thrown companionably around my shoulder ; my arms were wrapped around an enormous bunch of Easter lilies he had given me . We looked happy , carefree - alive . Tears threatened to start , and I blinked them away . After Dad had died I had transferred all my love and worship to Frank . Where had my beloved brother and protector gone ? I had trusted him , and he had betrayed me . No justice could make up for that . None . I was a third of the way through the bottle , half-way through the pan of brownies , and two-thirds through the album when Mother and Frank returned . Mother was rosy-cheeked and laughing from the cold as she shed a cheerful blizzard of hat , coat , scarf , and gloves ; Frank followed her stolidly with a pile of packages . " Jenny , darling-I 'm so glad you 're up at last ! You should have come with us - the after-Thanksgiving sales were wonderful ! We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , just put them over there on the couch , dear . " A new use for the dead , I thought : pack mules . Frank placed the boxes as ordered and settled into a chair across the room . I turned away from his white gaze . " Would you like a drink , Mom ? " I asked , just to be polite . " Why , I think I will have a little- just to warm up ! " She giggled and patted at her hair . She looked so much younger today than when we had sat down to dinner - was it only the day before yesterday ? While I found a glass , Mother pounced on the photo album . It was opened to a picture of Frank in his high school football uniform , the day he 'd been elected team captain . Tall , tanned , handsome , laughing into the camera , his wild red hair shining in the sun like a halo : a cheerleader 's dream , a mother 's joy . " Oh , Frank ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of you that day . Your father would have been proud , too . I wish he had lived to see it . " She brushed away what might have been a tear . The saccharine sentiment was the last straw . I gagged on it and everything else I had swallowed over the years : Mother 's favoritism toward Frank , my pride , Frank 's abuse , his semen , my hate . At last , at long last , I vomited up my rage . " You know , Frank , there 's an old Oriental proverb : Two can keep a secret - if one is dead . But you just could n't stay dead , could you , brother ? " I walked unsteadily across the room to where he sat , leaned over , and sniffed ostentatiously . " Lord , my brother hath not lain in his grave for three days , wherefore he stinketh . " " Jennifer ! You 're drunk ! " Right-o , Mom . For once . Something about the way Dad 's old trousers fit on Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I grabbed for his crotch , caught only a fistful of cloth , and laughed . " Poor Frank . What - are there rats in the family vault , brother ? Have they been chewing ? " Mother grabbed me and spun me around . " Out ! Get out of this house this minute ! " I savored the one word I had never dared say as it rolled off my tongue : " No . No , I do n't think I 'll do that . " I knew she would slap me . I caught her hand in mid-swing , and looked down at Frank , who had sat as blank-eyed and inscrutable as a buddha throughout . " Tell her , brother - tell Mom our secret : Tell her what her perfect son did all those nights in my room . " He shook his head . " You must tell her , Jenny . " " But , Frank-you know she wo n't believe me . I tried to tell her , many times , but she just did n't want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her " darling baby boy , " who was screwing and sodomizing his sister on a regular basis ! " Mother went white - with anger ? with shock ? " It 's not true , " she whispered , looking to Frank for confirmation . He never took his blank gaze off my face . " It is true , " he said . " And you knew it , too . " I turned on her . " You had to have heard him , you had to have heard me crying , you had to have seen the stains on my sheets . Jesus Christ , Mother ! - sometimes it was blood ! You knew every time . " She shook her head No but her panicked eyes said Yes . " I do n't know why I did n't get pregnant , " I mused . " He never used any protection . I used to pray that I would get pregnant ; then you 'd have to believe me . But even that would n't have made you stop , would it , Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stared into my glass , found it empty , did n't refill it . " That last night I lay there like some towel you 'd used , and I prayed to God that I would die . Then I prayed that you would die , and God answers prayer : that was the last night you ever laid a hand on me . " So , tell me , Frank - why did you come back ? " " For justice , Jenny . So that justice could be done . " " What justice , Frank ! Whose justice ? " Frank looked at Mother , broken and weeping . " Your justice , Jenny . " He stood up . " I will be leaving now . " " Tell me this , first . Did you ever feel even a little bit guilty , Frank ? Did you wrap your car around that pole on purpose ? " He paused with his hand on the door . " It 's been a long time , Jenny . I do n't remember . Think that , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for good this time , Frank ? " " No , Jenny . I do n't think you will ever be rid of me . " " You bastard ! " The glass left my hand and slammed into the side of his head with a dull crunch . A moment later I heard the front door open and close . I looked at the bottle of bourbon and shuddered . Mother was still crying . I went over to her and put a hand on her shoulder , but she did n't respond . After a minute I followed Frank out the front door . I sat on the step feeling utterly sober , hollow and weightless , and watched him walk down the street in the direction of the cemetery . The dent my glass had left in his skull had made his remaining hair stick up like his old cowlick . He looked so alone . The way I felt . I remembered another step , another time , a warm shoulder next to mine , a cowlicked head bent low , with mine , over something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My brother - o my brother - was dead . " Can you believe it ? They 're now cloning monkeys . " <p>
