Sometimes the love you 're afraid to show to the world turns out to be a source of pride By Rosemarie Robotham <p> IN THIS EXCERPT FROM Rosemarie Robotham 's luminous first novel , Zachary 's Wings , we neet Korie Morgan , a reporter for a major national magazine ; her best friend and fellow reporter , Simona Jones ; and Korie 's newfound love , Zachary Piper a now-unemployed social worker she met on assignment . Korie and Zach come from different worlds  --  he from workingclass Philadelphia , she from a more privileged family in Kingston , Jamaica . Despite their disparate backgrounds , they are irresistibly drawn to each other . As they make their first foray together into the mostly White world of Korie 's coworkers , she finds her own assumptions challenged . " Simona 's looking forward to meeting you Saturday , " Korie told Zach . They were hip-to-hip in Korie 's tiny kitchen after dinner , Zach washing dishes , Korie drying them . In two days , they would attend a gala to celebrate the fifth anniversary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , at least in New York City Zach seemed pensive ; he did n't say anything for a few moments , then he shrugged , " Simona wants to give me the once-over , I guess . See if I 'm good enough for you . " He said the last part as if he were joking , but he really was n't . " That 's nobody 's call but mine , " Korie declared , emptying the dish rack to make space for the glasses . And I already made that call . " " Yeah , but now I 'm being presented to your key spar , " Zach retorted . Key spar was Jamaican lingo for best friend ; it was the phrase Korie herself had used when she 'd described her relationship with Simona . Zach continued : " I 'm in social work , you know , and I 've seen it a million times . Peer judgment can be a mother . " Photograph <p> Korie looked at Zach , who was shirtless as usual , his skin smooth and invitingly warm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his hands still soaping a glass , Zach raised one arm so that Korie could enter its circle and settle more comfortably against him . " You worried , Zach Man ? " Korie asked him softly . " Hell , no , " he grinned . " Just you try to get rid of me ! " " Why would I want to do that ? " Korie murmured into his skin . She kissed his flat brown nipples and rested her cheek against the shallow dip at the center of his chest . " I 'm no fool , " she said . The anniversary party was held in a glass-walled private room at the back of an exclusive restaurant on the edge of Central Park . The entire staff of the magazine was there , as were a good number of freelancers and assorted media types . Above them a glass-paneled cathedral roof framed winter trees studded with tiny white lights . The lights created a cozy halo effect , as inside the room a jazz band , big-band era , played ballroom dance tunes . Partygoers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hors d'oeuvres , entrees and desserts . Across the room the bar was free , the drinks flowing . Korie , wearing a sleeveless red-silk pajama pantsuit , stood next to the hors d'oeuvres , pushing one deviled egg after another into her mouth . Simona stood next to her , stunning in a body-shaping strapless black gown . " You better go easy on those eggs , Korie girl . " Korie looked at her ruefully . " Oh , God , Sim , why am I so nervous ? What does it matter what these people think ? " " What anyone thinks , " Simona snorted . All that matters is what you think , Korie . " Simona was being serious ; as long as she 'd known her , Korie had been self-conscious in large crowds . And the fact that her date tonight was a shade overdressed in a black rented tux , while all the other men wore regular suits or sports jackets , did n't really help her feel any more comfortable . " Of course , " she pointed out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better in his rented suit than all the other men here . " Korie laughed at that , because it was true : Zach did look good , even in his too-formal suit , the sleeves of which fell a good two inches short . Zach had insisted on renting the suit . He did n't own another one , and had been worried he 'd embarrass Korie if he wore his frayed navy-blue blazer , the only jacket he owned . Korie had been dismayed when he 'd pulled the black tuxedo from its garment box earlier that afternoon , but she had n't wanted to make a fuss , especially as it was way too late for Zach to get another suit . So she 'd smiled gamely and told him he looked dashing . In fact , she thought he looked more like one of the waiters . Silently , Korie lectured herself about the folly of getting too caught up in appearances . Besides , it was n't just Zach 's appearance that bothered her . It was more that she was n't used to revealing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't exactly sure what she was revealing . She tried to tell herself that she did n't really care what her coworkers thought about Zach . After all , why should it matter that everyone now knew she was in love with a man who licked his fingers as he ate hors d'oeuvres , could n't find a rented suit to fit the length of his arms , and was perfectly happy to stand alone in a corner of the room and watch the proceedings with a drink in his hand ? Zach was doing that now , over near the band , nodding his head slightly to the beat and looking as if it was the most natural thing in the world to stand apart like that when everyone else was mingling . " You go ahead , " he 'd said to Korie when she had wanted to go over and greet one of the photographers . " I 'll wait for you here . " " Come with me , " Korie had said . " I 'll introduce you . " " Baby , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . They want to talk shop with you . I 'll wait here . I 'm okay . Honest . " Korie sensed that beneath his projected ease , Zach probably felt as much like a fish out of water as he ever had . She had to admit this was definitely not his scene , but he was handling it bravely . It was Korie who was turning out to be the coward , Korie who was n't managing to take things in stride . Joel Crandon , the entertainment reporter , stopped by the hors d'oeuvres table.Hello , girls , " he greeted Korie and Simona . " Tell me , who 's that young Black man over there ? Tall , dark and handsome , is n't he ? " " Forget it , " Simona said . " He 's straight . " " Girls have all the fun , " Joel teased , taking a deviled egg from Korie 's fingers and sailing into the crowd with it . Korie smiled weakly after him , then looked at Simona . " My sense of humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're an isolationist , sweetie . You do n't do well at parties . That 's how we met , remember . Just relax . " Simona picked up a piece of shrimp and dipped it in wasabi mustard . " Whew , spicy , " she said . Next she sampled a pig in a blanket , grimacing as she chewed . " Awful , " she said . " Who made this garbage ? " " Four-star chefs , " Korie chuckled . " You should try the eggs . " Simona made an expression of distaste . " No thank you . I think I 'll take a walk . Coming ? " " No , you go ahead , " Korie answered , glancing back at Zach . Simona followed her gaze . " Do n't worry so much , " she admonished . " He 's doing just fine . " Leaving Korie , Simona strolled lazily across the dance floor , the men in the room following the slow swish of her dress with their eyes . Korie 's heart jumped into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor emeritus , Randall Wright , walked up to Zach and the two of them began chatting . She stood for a moment , trying to decide what to do , then she carefully picked her way through the crowd , exchanging greetings with familiars as she made her way over to Zach and the old editor . But as she approached them , she heard Zach say , " Well , strictly speaking , I 'm unemployed . But my last job was in social work . " She decided to stay where she was , close enough to hear them , far enough away for them not to notice her amid the crowd of people casually waiting their turn at the bar . " I started in social work , too , " Randall Wright said . " On a reservation in New Mexico . " " Reservation ? " Zach said . " Grew up near there , " Wright shared . " My old man was three-quarters Apache . I was in social work trying to place Native American kids in stable foster homes . " Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . " " It 's a crime what America 's done to the Indians , " Zach said , neglecting , Korie noted with horror , to use the politically correct " Native Americans . " Randall Wright did n't seem to care , though . " It 's a crime what America 's done to all people of color , " he declared . " And it 's getting worse . Kids these days growing up with no idealism , no sense that they can change things . Sometimes , it seems to me that social workers are the only idealists left . " " Oh , I 'd say you writers have a pretty deep streak of idealism , " Zach chuckled . " Or so I 've found . I live with one of your reporters , Korie Morgan . Now there 's a stubborn idealist . But God bless her ; you got ta love her . " Korie winced at his candor , at his lack of subtlety . But Randall Wright laughed richly . " Ai n't love grand , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man display . Amazed , she realized that Zach had performed his usual magic ; he had been so open with Randall Wright , so devoid of awe , he had put him entirely at ease . She saw suddenly that Wright was so used to being treated as the revered editor emeritus , he had n't been able to express who he truly was , a simple man , with simple delights . " Come , let me introduce you to my wife , " Randall said . " She 's right over there . She used to be in social work , too . " Korie stepped back into the crowd at the bar as they passed , marveling at the fact that Zach had found his way into this gathering of mostly White journalists without her assistance . Her parents , she found herself thinking , might not have thought him capable of such grace . And then she understood the source of her discomfort , understood why she would forever be anxious about presenting a new lover socially . In the rigidly class-conscious world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speech , occupation-all the facets of external presentation-were the currency that counted . A man was first judged on these things , and if , on these counts , he was found wanting , one might never glean that beneath it all he might be a man worth knowing . But Zach 's exchange with Randall Wright had shown her that nothing was quite so clear-cut as she 'd imagined-indeed , as she 'd feared . She felt ashamed of herself , ashamed of the way she , more than anyone , had secretly judged Zach , even as she 'd pretended not to , even as she 'd professed not to care about such trivial details as his employment status and party manners and the right suit . Korie watched now as Simona joined Randall Wright and Zach in a circle that included Wright 's wife and a few other magazine people . Randall Wright was talking ; Korie saw the people in the group laugh at something he said , saw Zach 's Adam 's apple bob up and down in his smooth brown throat as he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Korie stood , Zach looked so elegant , so much a part of everything , that her heart began to ache . Suddenly , she did n't feel worthy of him-the irony ! did n't feel worthy of this sleek , penniless lover standing easily among her colleagues in a rented suit . In that moment , she felt keenly that she would lose him , that she was the one who would never belong , and he would be drawn away from her , captured by the brilliance of everyone else . Even when she told herself she was being foolish , that this was merely a phantom of her childhood coming back to woo her , she still could n't stop the hollow feeling in her heart . Then Simona put her hand on Zach 's arm and led him onto the dance floor . Korie fought down a pang of jealousy as her friend moved into an effortless three  --  step with Zach , gazing up at him with laughing , too-bright eyes . Korie thought for a wild moment of getting her coat and simply leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , a smile pasted to her lips as she watched the man she loved and the woman she loved float over the dance floor with an ease and fluidity that excluded her . Zach was having fun . Somehow she had n't expected that . She had expected him to experience the party through her , the way her ex-husband , Sam , would have done . Simona and Zach were approaching her now , Simona swinging Zach 's hand as if they were old friends . " Your man sure can dance , " she said as she delivered him back to Korie 's side . " And he 's charming , too . I would n't let him out of my sight again if I were you . " As Simona disappeared into the milling crowd , Zach slipped an arm around Korie 's shoulders . " Dance ? " he smiled . No , Korie did n't want to dance ; she wanted to go home . Simona was right ; she was an isolationist . It was Zach , with his gentle , unpretentious humor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two of them . Oh , Korie could wear the mask . She could smile and make small talk on demand-her parents had given her that-but she 'd never learned to enjoy it . Deep down , Korie had to admit that she did n't want to share Zach with the people at this party any more than she had wanted to share him with his friends that first time she 'd visited him in Philadelphia . But she knew that to act on that impulse now would be selfish , and she did n't ever want to be selfish with Zach , so she said , " Sure , let 's dance . " Zach bent so that he could whisper in her ear . " Or would you rather go home ? " he said . Korie looked at him , a smile breaking across her face , her shoulders opening like a morning flower in the sunlight . " There 's nowhere I 'd rather be with you than home , " she said . And she was n't being selfish when she said it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robotham is an editor-at-large of ESSENCE .
