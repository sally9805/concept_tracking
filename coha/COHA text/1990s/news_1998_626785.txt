<p> A straight line is the shortest distance between two points . I learned that in school . A straight line also is the most absolute certainty amid the variables of judging fish . I learned that on the water . <p> Scales can vary and photographs can lie and eyeballs can exaggerate , but the length of a fish as measured against the king 's yard is irrefutable support for bragging rights . <p> Length more so than weight assures trophy status ; it can not be taken away ( more than can be said for the inflated weight of eggs or food in a sow 's belly ) . <p> Fresh or salt , near or far , a compact , portable measuring device is a wise accessory . A ready ruler can establish non-contestable status and , most important , keep you on the safe side of the law . <p> Our tides and lakes increasingly are tangled in red tape , and not the least of these regulations are the many minimum and maximum length limits . The sport fish not governed by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get me started on the woeful lack of legal respect for top-end speckled trout ) . <p> The regulations are confusing , often changing , and it is the responsibility of each angler to know the lengths that are in vogue . But knowing them does little good if you can not apply them . Rest assured the nearest state or federal warden will be able to fine-tune the inches and increments . <p> The veteran angler can do a fair job of eyeballing marginal candidates , but even the practiced hand can get fooled . Small water or close quarters can make a small fish look larger than life . So , for that matter , can a slow day . <p> And , if you are off by more than a minute fraction , the law may not cut you any slack . <p> For instance , the minimum length on speckled trout is 15 inches - not 14 3/4 plus a smile . If it 's very close but short , a warden in a benevolent mood may let you walk , but this is an expensive gamble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trout with all the legal squeeze applied to the tail is painfully close , but baseball is not the only game measured in inches . <p> Legalities aside , a ready measuring system can verify a benchmark fish . This can be satisfying information in a catch-and-release situation removed from support . <p> The wader without a tape may never know if that great Baffin Bay release was a legitimate 30-inch trout or " only " 29 . They all look big over about 27 or 28 inches - at least they do to me . <p> Yes , you can fake it and it would be nice to know for certain . A true 30 has magic status . <p> Perhaps the easiest way for the solo angler to maintain a handy measuring device is to tape significant lengths on a rod . Several companies offer tapes and markers that adhere to the rod ; these are effective but can clutter an otherwise clean blank . <p> For example , the fly fisherman with a $ 500 Orvis or the plugger with a $ 300 G. Loomis that glows with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the side . <p> But , for a workhorse rod , these stick-on rulers are fast and reliable . A compromise for a fine rod is to mark several significant lengths with discreet dots or thread wraps . <p> The risk is that if - when - the length limits change , you must refinish the marks or risk dated and potentially costly confusion . <p> The rod itself can define certain marks . Measure the distance from the butt to , say , the bottom guide wrap . Or the guide itself . Whatever . Play around and you should be able to locate a few workable reference points . <p> The problem for the angler with several similar rods is remembering which one carries the confirmed marks . And , even with the right rod in hand , it 's wise policy after a layoff of several weeks to refresh your memory on where the measures begin and end . <p> The angler in a serious fishing boat should have access to a yardstick taped to the console or defined on the lid of a cooler . Metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick and positive calibrations ( popular among tournament anglers ) . <p> It is the wader or bank walker who usually is caught unprepared . An alternative to the rod measure for the angler afoot is a retractable cloth tape measure than can be toted in a pocket . <p> Press the little button and - presto ! - the tape can be withdrawn from the flat spool to the desired length . Once the measurement is confirmed , you press the little button again and - shazam ! - the tape rewinds . Well , sometimes . <p> These gadgets have a way of breaking or sticking on the water , usually jamming at extreme length . Now you have three feet of coiling tape to stuff like a ribbon snake in your fly vest or wading shirt . Quit griping - at least you can measure that lunker . <p> Not only can you record the length of a trophy catch , you can use the flexible tape to measure the all-important girth . At least , the girth is critical if you wish to run the numbers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , divided by 800 for most species ) . <p> On common light-tackle fish such as largemouth bass and rainbow trout ( or , in saltwater , reds and specks ) the length is taken to the tip of the tail . <p> Species with deeply forked tails are measured at the fork . The girth measurement is taken at the thickest part , usually just ahead of the dorsal . The tape should wrap smoothly around the fish and perpendicular to the length . <p> You do n't have to squeeze tight , leaving stress marks on the poor sow , but neither should you slip a sly thumb and/or index under the tape . Take an honest wrap and the formula is commendably close , maybe within a few ounces on an 8- or 10-pound fish . <p> A measuring device can provide an accurate length but that 's not the whole issue . I told you we live in a sea ( or lake , as the case may be ) of red tape . <p> The acceptable measure might depend on who is doing the measuring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape . " Length " has several definitions . <p> The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department is pretty generous . For precise work , you place the fish flat on its side with its mouth closed . Then you squeeze the tail fin together , compressing it for maximum length . <p> Or , with a forked tail , you tilt it to the rear , which also increases the length . Either ploy might add 1/2-inch or more to a marginal keeper . That 's a fair bonus . It is all fish . <p> But do n't tell that to the International Game Fish Association . That august organization specifies both fork-length and tip-length measurements must be taken from tail fins spread in the natural position . No squeezing or tilting . <p> Either way , the legal length measurement is taken in a straight line , and not along the rounded contour of the side . Camp measurements can be a bit more casual ; indeed , a good way to gain length for bragging rights is to start at the tip of the lower jaw and tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tail fin . <p> It 's still all fish , and after several toasts , the shady ruling tends to stick . <p> And , among gentlemen , most fractions are rounded up . Within reason . A trout of 29 1/4 might have to take an awfully deep breath to muster 30 , but 29 1/2 - no problem . That 's a gim me among sympathetic peers . <p> But , to reiterate , the " gentleman 's measure " may or may not conform to legal requirements . It is not recommended on a borderline keeper . That fellow approaching with the badge and the tape might see it differently . Know the length , the real length , when it matters .
