METZNER Do I wake you ? p. 37 METZNER No , but it hurts , hearing you . . . METZNER I try to be quiet . METZNER But you 're screaming , are n't you ? Like in my dream last night . There was this field of bare trees and snow , and swirls of fire round and round , but everything was in black and white . Very gray swirls . Sometimes they were snow , and sometimes they were fire . . . And there was this boy , a small boy with a striped shirt , and he was sitting in front of a machine spinning this film which was my dream . And I wanted to steal it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in my dream . And at the same time these gray swirls of fire kept churning in front of me , and somebody kept running between the trees . Very distant , not even a shadow , and I knew it was you . I know it was you , screaming . Silence . METZNER I 'm here . I 'm not screaming . He holds her , rocks her . A soft light comes through the window . TODD is seen , looking in , then disappears . JEFF raises GINA 's face to him . He caresses her . They begin to make love . Music comes up : Billie Holiday 's " Lover Come Back . Lights fade . END OF PLAY .                                                                 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
