<p> Fried brains and boiled kidneys and weird glands covered with membranes . <p> And , honey , we 're just talking appetizers . <p> This Halloween do n't go to all the trouble to make cakes and candies and peeled grapes seem like internal organs . Why not just serve the real thing ? <p> Hee , hee , hee . <p> Organ meats may seem like the ultimate gross out , but if you 've never bitten into a perfectly sauteed slice of sweetbreads or a custardy round of fried brain , you 're in for a real grownup treat . <p> Other than liver , organ meats have never been particularly popular in America . Because soft tissue tends to spoil quickly , we can almost never find fresh variety meats at area markets . Quality butchers , such as Oliver 's Meat Market on East Sixth Avenue , will sometimes have some sweetbreads or kidneys in the freezer , but brains usually require a special order . <p> Over in France - the land of a thousand offal recipes - consumption of variety meats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street Journal . Consumers there are increasingly wary of the high levels of cholesterol in variety meats and less respectful of the country 's culinary tradition . The situation is so dire that the French government at one point unveiled a series of advertisements designed to promote the consumption of organ meat . <p> When chef Lydia Shire of Biba restaurant in Boston first worked in a French kitchen , she got a crash course in preparing internal organs . " When the chef cooked brains for the first time , I thought , ' Oh my God , how gross ! " ' <p> But she became a big fan , and when she opened Biba 6 1/2 years ago , she included an entire offal section on her menu . " I really thought there are some Europeans and older people out there who have been brought up with liver , kidney and tripe , " says Shire . " And there was so much sameness going on with menus and chefs . <p> " And guess what : It did n't gross people out . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since . Selections have included grilled veal kidney , beef lips , beef cheeks , and mondongo - a South American tripe soup in which Shire floats big scoops of fresh avocado . But among her most famous recipes , Shire counts an impeccable plate of breaded fried brains with a sherry vinegar shallot sauce . <p> If you 're at all tempted to try your hand at variety meats , the easiest to find and prepare are veal sweetbreads . <p> Sweetbreads are the thymus gland that directs growth in baby animals and then disappears in adults . They come as a set of lobes attached in the center . <p> Now stay with me ; do n't gross out . To cook sweetbreads , you must first poach them briefly so that you can easily peel off the thick outer membrane . You can then slice the sweetbreads , flour them or bread them , and then give them a quick saute . Some chefs like to peel away the thin inner membranes , but this step renders the sweetbreads into a pile of small chunks . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when cooking and are barely noticeable . <p> Sweetbreads always pair well with a cream sauce . Given the already high cholesterol of organ meats , now 's the time to splurge on cream . The recipe below combines wild mushrooms , wine , shallots , lemon juice and zest and a pinch of fresh tarragon in a creamy base . This recipe is easy to prepare and so delicious you 'll become a believer . <p> Now that you 've tried sweetbreads , you 're ready for brains . Following is Lydia Shire 's famous recipe , which is somewhat more time-consuming to prepare , but the results are truly amazing . <p> Brains also have an outer membrane , but it 's much easier to pull off . Just soak the brains in water for a few minutes to loosen the membrane , then pull it away with your fingers . It 's a little bloody , and you 'll have to wash the blood off under cold running water . <p> You then poach the brains in a court bouillon ( a seasoned cooking broth ) until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saute . Shire recommends using the excellent Japanese bread crumbs called panko , available at Asian markets . But fresh bread crumbs work well , too . <p> Are you still with me ? Good . Now we can try Andre Soltner 's recipe for veal kidney in a mustard cream sauce . Kidneys are n't bloody , but they 're coated with thick fat that you can easily peel off . The French say that rendered kidney fat is the best medium for frying french fries . Soltner , the owner of Lutece restaurant in New York , uses a classic , easy recipe that requires no more than 30 minutes cooking time . <p> Yes , these are all scary-sounding treats . Yet they 're all fairly easy to cook , the recipes are foolproof , and the results ca n't be beat . <p> Go ahead : Put your heart into it . <p> SWEETBREADS WITH LEMON-MUSHROOM CREAM <p> 1 set veal sweetbreads ( 1 to 1 1/4 pounds ) , thawed and cut through the connection that attaches the two lobes <p> 1 scant tablespoon vegetable oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assorted domestic and wild mushrooms , cleaned and trimmed <p> Salt and freshly ground black pepper <p> 1/2 medium shallot , sliced thinly <p> 1/2 cup dry white wine <p> 1/2 cup heavy cream <p> 1 teaspoon minced or grated lemon zest <p> 1 teaspoon lemon juice <p> 1 teaspoon minced fresh tarragon leaves <p> Flour for dredging ( about 3/4 cup ) , seasoned with a large pinch of salt <p> Soak sweetbreads for at least 3 hours or overnight in a bowl of cold water . <p> Bring a medium saucepan half filled with water to a boil .
