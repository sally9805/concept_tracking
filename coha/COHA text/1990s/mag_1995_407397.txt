A friend sat on the edge of my couch , gape-mouthed and glaring like a codfish in the bottom of a dory . The silvery caps on her molars flickered as she stammered for control of her vocal chords . I had just confided to her that my wife and I were expecting our third child . This news she had taken in stride . The shock had come with my response to her request to tour the nursery . Your babies sleep with you ? Right in your bed ? " Sure , " I replied in my " Where else ? " tone of voice . Well , what about ... ? " What about what ? " I 'd be afraid of rolling over and squashing the baby . " You 've obviously never tried to squash a baby . They squirm and pinch and scream in your ear . They do n't squash easily . " Well , what about ... you know , marital relations ? " Oh , yes , now that you mention it , I do recall that marital relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that " absolutely none " was the only solution . " I let the words hang for a couple of seconds . " All in-laws must sleep in the guest bed ! " Stop teasing me ! You know what I mean ! " Do you mean , " How can we possibly adhere to relatively recent and arbitrary social taboos dictating complete privacy for the sex act if we have a bed full of kids ? ' ' " Of course that 's what I mean . " Why did n't you just say that ? It is no problem at all . " Flexibility ! Anytime ! Anywhere ! ' is our motto . That is , anytime that the baby is n't crying or nursing or wet or messy and the older boys are away or asleep and the dishes are clean and the laundry is folded and we are both feeling rested , refreshed , well nourished and frisky at the same time . No problem . " Oh , I see . " Besides , having a kid or two sharing the bed has provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sitting on to compete as venues for our indoor recreational events . I could show you ... " Ten polished fingernails tracked my movements . " Do n't touch me ! " No , silly , the nursery . Let me show you how we 've transformed the room . " It is true that both of our older children spent the first thousand nights of their lives with us in our " family bed . " We expect no less from the latest little one . I know what you 're thinking-probably some vegetarian , sandal-shod , alternative lifestyle guy . Well , I do prefer to graze low on the food chain , and my footwear does tend to be revealing , but if welcoming my babies into bed is also " alternative " in our culture then I 'd like to ask " Why ? " Why do new parents feel normal when buying a tiny bed with bars rather than a great big bed with room for everyone ? Why do we covet detached , single-family houses that allow us to dispatch each family member , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fortunate enough to have space for a nursery in the house , why not create an oasis : an observatory , a meditation temple , a library , or a music studio ? A room-sized container for a ten-pound human seems contrary to common sense and the expectations of biology . Nurseries must have been invented by an insomniac . If the baby is down the hall at night the chances are excellent that at least one adult is going to wake to a squalling baby monitor , crawl out of a warm bed , fumble with the light , trudge down to the nursery , feed the baby in the rocking chair , pace about to exorcise a burp and then sing and cuddle until the babe is sleeping soundly enough to be put down again without wailing . In contrast , our babies move in and out of deep sleep in sync with their mother . They seldom wake fully , just enough to siphon a serving of warm milk from a full breast into an empty tummy . We can hear , smell and touch each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency of sleeping near my children to " knit up the ravell 'd sleave " of my imperfect parenting . Try It . Good night . <p>
