IN THE 1950S AND EARLY ' 60S , THE most bloodcurdling years of the civil rights movement , a great Southern judge , and there were not many of them , needed not only wisdom and fairness but a lot of nerve . Which is why Frank Johnson , a federal district judge who was equipped with all three , emerged as one of the heroes of that era . After the Eisenhower appointee declared that the segregated buses of Montgomery , Alabama , were illegal , his mother 's house was partly destroyed by a bomb that was apparently meant for him . Undaunted , Johnson went on to apply Supreme Court antidiscrimination rulings to resentful state institutions . <P> When Johnson announced his retirement last year from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals , which covers Alabama , Georgia and Florida , the White House came up with an unlikely replacement : Edward E. Carnes , 41 , Alabama 's assistant attorney general in charge of pursuing death-penalty cases . And pursue them he does . Carnes wrote Alabama 's death-penalty law , which allows judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juries have opted for life in prison . He led a national effort by state attorneys general to curb the opportunities for death-row prisoners to appeal their cases before federal judges . People who do n't much care for him  --  they include many civil rights leaders and death-penalty opponents  --  call him Dr. Death . <P> The Senate debate on the Carnes nomination this week promises to be the most contentious vote on a lower-court candidate in years . Despite the tough-sell symbolism of replacing Johnson , a civil rights legend , with a nominee best known for hustling inmates to the electric chair , Carnes appeared to be on a smooth course to confirmation before the question of racism in the justice system was illuminated by the fires of Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict . Meanwhile , the Democratic dream of recapturing the White House moved from fond hope to real prospect . After 12 years in which the Reagan and Bush Administrations have filled three-quarters of all federal judgeships with mostly conservative appointees , some Democrats in Congress are now thinking twice about giving fast approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmation in what may be the waning days of the Bush presidency . <P> But Carnes has some important supporters , including both of Alabama 's Democratic Senators , Richard Shelby and Howell Heflin . A powerful swing vote on the Senate Judiciary Committee , Heflin complains that Carnes ' opponents " view this confirmation as being a referendum on capital punishment , although they deny it . " In May , Heflin got the committee to send Carnes ' name to the full Senate despite the opposition of the committee chairman , Delaware Senator Joe Biden , a fellow Democrat . <P> To the consternation of some black civil rights leaders , Morris Dees , the white Alabama civil rights lawyer famed for successfully fighting the Ku Klux Klan in court , is also in the nominee 's corner , arguing that Carnes is not a racist but just a man who has capably pursued his duty as a prosecutor . The Harvard-trained lawyer has prosecuted two state judges for making racist remarks in court and has defended blacks in civil rights lawsuits .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
