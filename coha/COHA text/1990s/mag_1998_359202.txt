Huddled in a plexiglas incubator , 3 1/2-lb . Andreah Moran is , at nine days , so fragile that she looks as if her twig-thin arms and legs would snap from one false move . But gingerly navigating the tangle of blue electrodes attached to the infant 's chest , John Dieter , a researcher at the University of Miami 's Touch Research Institute , firmly massages those arms and legs and rubs Andreah 's back and her tiny head . The baby sighs , parts her withered lips and begins a slow drool . <P> Infant massage ? It sounds more like a New Age ritual than an internationally recognized alternative therapy . But studies at the Touch Research Institute have found that preemies massaged three times a day for as few as five days consistently fare better than equally frail babies who do n't get massages . Full-term infants and older babies also benefit from them . The International Association of Infant Massage , which held its annual conference last month in Orlando , Fla. , estimates that 10,000 parents took infant-massage training last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relieves colic and helps hyperactive children relax . <P> All of which can be a godsend for anxious new parents . " We 've got results already , " says Luis Teijeiro , a 38-year-old Miami resident who began massaging his 11-week-old daughter Alissa in June . " Before , her fist was always clenched so tight she was like a little boxer . " Now when Alissa wakes up crying in the middle of the night , he massages her . Within minutes , she falls back to sleep . <P> Dr. Tiffany Field , a Miami child psychologist who founded the Touch Research Institute six years ago with a $250,000 grant from Johnson &; Johnson , says massage stimulates the vagus nerves , which then trigger processes that aid digestion , among other things . As a result of their speedy weight gain , Field says , massaged preemies are discharged to their parents an average of six days earlier , shaving $10,000 off their hospital tab . With 400,000 premature babies born in the U.S. every year , the potential cost savings are apparent . And eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior motor skills and mental development . <P> For much of this century , the prevailing thought was that pre-term babies should not be touched , since the slightest shock could prove fatal . Ever so slowly , the medical establishment has been warming to the idea that massage helps sickly babies . Yet only a handful of hospital nurseries in the U.S. offer massage to these tiniest of patients . Hospital administrators remain skeptical of claims about its therapeutic value , and since most HMOs do n't cover baby massage , there 's little incentive to start pilot programs . Besides , harried nurses can barely handle the steady stream of critically ill infants with special needs , much less find time to give thrice-daily rubdowns . <P> But thousands of parents of healthy babies are n't waiting for the medical establishment to jump on the bandwagon . For today 's upwardly mobile parents , baby massage is becoming what Lamaze was to the previous generation . Classes that teach parents Swedish and Indian massage techniques to use on babies are springing up around the U.S. , often with long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in special pilot programs to build parenting skills .
