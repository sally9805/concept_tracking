<p> Information for this article is provided by the Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Referral Service , a program of the U.S. Department of Energy . <p> At one time , most people saw only the advantages that windows provided  --  natural lighting , ventilation , emergency escape routes , and scenic views . However , as the energy consciousness of Americans increased over the years , people began to look for ways to save energy , resulting in a detailed scrutiny of the average home . Windows did n't fare well . <p> People discovered that windows ( if consisting of a single pane of clear , untreated glass , the norm for many years ) were thermal weak spots in homes ; that windows could lose up to 15 times more heat than an equal area of wall space ; and that they could account for up to 25 percent of a home 's heat loss in winter and heat gain in summer . <p> Windows can still account for up to 25 percent of your home 's heat loss in winter and heat gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the case . There are many ways to improve their energy efficiency . Storm windows , low-emissivity ( low-e ) glass , heat-absorbing glass , reflective glass , and double- and triple-paned ( also called glazed ) window units , are just a few of the options which can significantly increase a window 's " R-value " ( resistance to heat transfer ) , and have been on the marketplace for years . And now , several improvements and new developments in window technology  --  some of which have produced windows with R-values comparable to walls  --  offer you even more options . <p> Traditionally , the approach to increasing window efficiency has been to increase the number of panes of glass used in the unit . For example , a single-paned window unit with untreated glass has a rating of nearly R-1 . Consequently , a double-paned unit with untreated glass has a rating of R-2.1 , and a triple-paned unit with untreated glass has a rating of R-3.2 . This is because each pane of glass added to the window unit forms an air space , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The additional panes of glass , however , increase the weight and cost of the unit . Innovative Low-E Glass <p> Having first been used in the United States in 1981 , low-e glazing is not a new technology . However , the widespread use of low-e glass by builders and manufacturers makes it the most noticeable window trend around . All the major window manufacturers offer low-e glazing as a standard feature on some of their windows , and as an option for many of their others . In fact , one major window manufacturer has decided to produce only low-e windows . Despite the 10 to 20 percent higher cost over untreated glazing , demand for low-e glazing is enormous . In 1988 , 11 million low-e insulating glass units were sold in the United States . By 1991 , more than half of all double-paned sealed insulating windows made in the United States are expected to incorporate low-e glazing . <p> Energy Performance of Low-E Glazing . Offering a 35 percent lower heat loss rate than conventional double-paned windows , a double-paned window unit with a low-e coating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of R-2.5 to R-3.2 . This type of window , although comparable to a triple-paned window without low-e glazing , is more common because it is usually less expensive . ( The R-values mentioned throughout this text are to be taken as approximations only , since the exact R-value of the unit will be dependent upon such factors as the low-e process used , the specific coatings used by the manufacturer , and the window frame . ) In cold climates , the low-e coating should be placed on the outer surface of the inner pane to prevent heat from radiating out of the house . This placement will also reduce summer heat gain . In warm climates , the low-e coating should be placed on the inner surface of the outer pane . This placement reflects heat being radiated from outside objects away from the house better than the other placement . <p> A triple-paned , low-e unit , typically formed by the thin low-e plastic layer which is stretched between the two panes of glass , reflects radiant heat back into a room . Appropriate in cold climates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R-value over the double-paned , low-e unit can be attributed in part to the second air space which is created by the third layer . <p> Gas-Filled , Low-E Windows . One type of low-e , double-paned window unit uses argon instead of air in the space between the two panes . With a rating of R-4 or higher , this gas-filled unit is comparable to a window unit with four panes , and offers a heat transfer rate that is 70 percent lower than untreated double-paned units . <p> Argon is an environmentally safe , cheap , and widely available gas , which constitutes approximately 1 percent of the earth 's atmosphere . A double-paned window unit with argon gas in the space between the two panes offers a greater reduction of conductive and convective heat losses than a unit with an air-filled space . This is because argon is an inert gas which does n't conduct heat as well as air . <p> European manufacturers have been filling their windows with gas for several years . However , U.S. customers are concerned that they will be charged extra for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit and eventually be replaced by air . To allay this concern , at least one major manufacturer is filling all of its low-e , double-paned units with argon at no extra cost , and others are expected to follow . <p> Hurd Millwork Company of Medford , Wisconsin , introduced a new line of gas-filled windows in January 1990 , called InSol-8 . These windows , which offer an R-8 rating , use the Superglass system developed by Southwall Technologies Inc . ( STI ) of Palo Alto , California . This low-e , quadruple-paned unit features two layers of Heat Mirror low-e film placed between the two panes . ( Heat Mirror , a registered trademark , was patented by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , and is produced by STI under exclusive license from MIT ) . The low-e coated films reflect heat back to the inside in the winter and to the outside in the summer . This window unit has three air spaces filled with a mixture of several inert , environmentally safe gases , formulated by STI , which further reduce conductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacers made of a non-conductive material that prevent condensation from forming around the edges of the window in winter and provide structural strength and rigidity . It also has a barrier wrap that completely surrounds the edge to prevent gas leakage and moisture formation . <p> As the R-values of windows increase , the edge spacers and frames used in the window unit become more important considerations . This is because the R-value of a window is typically a center-of-glass performance rating . That is , the R-value assigned to the window refers solely to the measurement at the center of the window . The R-value for the outer edges of the window may be lower , depending on the edge spacers and frame of the unit . In the Laboratory <p> The above mentioned window innovations , coined " superwindows , " are impressive with their high R-values . However , current laboratory research in window technology promises many more impressive innovations , offering even higher R-values . A few are highlighted below . <p> Evacuated-Glass Window . This window has two panes of glass , which are held apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the air out of the space between them , a vacuum  --  which eliminates conduction and convection  --  is formed . Samples of this window have yielded ratings of R-10 to R-15 . ( One type , which will permanently seal the perimeter by laser-welding the glass together , is predicted to have a rating of R-16 . ) The thrust of the research at this stage is to find a cost-effective mass-manufacturing process . <p> Aerogel . Basically sand , aerogel is a thick , lightweight silica material made up of microscopic air pockets . The air pockets are almost small enough to trap single molecules of air , and thus reduce heat transfer . This product is expected to offer an R-20 rating ; however , the major problem is that the material is translucent rather than transparent . Currently , aerogel research is directed toward producing high R-value insulation for refrigerators , and insulating fill for glass blocks , rather than for window applications . <p> Krypton-Filled Windows . These are different from argon-filled windows only in that krypton is the inert gas used in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe gas , and research has shown that it has a lower conductivity rate than argon . The three best research designs  --  consisting of krypton and air or krypton and argon  --  have produced windows with ratings of R-11 , R-12 , and R-13 . The major focus of this research effort is directed at the filling process . Since krypton is a relatively expensive gas , laboratory work centers on developing a process that wastes as little of this gas as possible . <p> Cloud Gel . This polymer water solution was invented by Day Chahroudi , who receives most of the credit for inventing Heat Mirror . This plastic film is transparent when the indoor temperature is cool , allowing solar heat gain , but turns white when warm or hot , blocking out unwanted heat gain . The temperature at which Cloud Gel will change from clear to white would typically be in the 75 to 85 degree F range ; however , the exact temperature change could be controlled by an adjustment during the manufacturing process . <p> Holographic Optical Film . If mounted on ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any desired spot in a room , such as dark areas , regardless of the sun 's position . Researchers expect the film to reduce the need for artificial lighting and the additional air conditioning it requires . If successfully developed , it will be a revolution in daylighting and window technology . <p> Electrochromatic Film . By applying an electric charge to thin metallic coatings or film applied to one surface of a double-paned unit , the optical properties of electrochromatic film can be altered . As long as the electric current is traveling through the coating , the glazing is transparent ; however , when the current is turned off , the glazing turns solid white . This type of window offers privacy , and may either reduce or increase heat transmission or reduce radiant heat loss , depending on the presence of an electrical current . Currently available by special order from Marvin Windows of Warrod , Minnesota , these windows are priced at about $200 per square foot . Laboratory research is focused on reducing this price to between $46 and $50 . The New Windows ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those expected to follow shortly , it is evident that window technology has made great strides over the last decade . In fact , it is expected that these innovations , as they receive greater acceptance , will have a great impact on the housing industry . As the R-values of windows continue to approach those of walls , windows will no longer be thought of as thermal weak spots in homes . For the housing industry , this could mean the design and construction of homes with more windows than ever before . <p> This impact could be especially immense in passive solar homes . Highly efficient windows could be sited on the north-facing side of a home and be a source of heat gain in the winter , rather than a source of heat loss . To people buying homes , the new superwindows could mean having all the windows they ever wanted in a home , and not having to pay for the luxury with high heating and cooling bills . <p> Window Labeling . The new superwindows have focused unprecedented attention on window performance . Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If any of the bills become law , the window industry will have to implement a federally-directed labeling system which will rate windows according to energy efficiency , resistance to water leakage , air infiltration , and condensation . <p> In addition , the Fenestration Committee of the Building Thermal Envelope Coordination Council , operated by the National Institute of Building Sciences , is calling for industry and government to work together to develop national energy performance criteria for windows in a form that will be easy for the general public to understand . The labels would be very similar to those used on appliances . <p> Currently , the National Research Center , a subsidiary of the National Association of Homebuilders , offers window manufacturers a way to verify their thermal performance claims with their newly-launched Fenestration Certification Program . About Low-E Glass <p> Low-e glass is made in two different ways . In the " magnetic sputtered vacuum deposition " process , commonly called " soft coat , " a metal ( typically tin oxide or silver ) is " sputtered " onto the glass in ultra-thin layers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emissivity . This process is performed sheet by sheet in a vacuum chamber . In the later-developed pyrolitic process , commonly called " hard coat , " hot metallic oxide is baked onto the surface of the hot glass as it comes off the production line . <p> Soft coat glass is the most common , and provides a low-e glass with an R-value approximately 20 percent higher than the hard coat variety . However , soft coat degrades in the open air and is easily damaged , so it is used only on the inside of double-paned , sealed units . <p> Despite its lower performance rating , hard coat is preferred by many manufacturers because it is the more durable of the two types . Research directed at the hard coat process has produced a new variety of hard coat that has an energy performance which rivals that of soft coat .
