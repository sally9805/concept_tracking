Among the biggest threats to the future of corporate America are genetically engineered babies . They 'll look cute and harmless at first , with their tiny noses and symmetrical faces . Only later will the horror reveal itself , when the generation of perfect-looking people enters the work force with no marketable skills whatsoever . Can corporations survive without engineers , economists , programmers , scientists and other skilled labor ? Where will the future Fords and Sarnoffs and Jobs come from ? <P> Admit it : you 've wondered why beautiful people rarely have any state-of-the-art skills . Are they born dumb , or does something happen to them during childhood ? ( Unless you 're beautiful yourself , you 've had those thoughts , so stop rolling your eyes and making that " phhht " sound . ) <P> Fortunately , it has n't mattered that beautiful people have no useful skills . There are n't enough beautiful people to damage the economy . But that situation will change , probably in your lifetime , thanks to genetic engineering . Future generations will be tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair that never thins . If history is our guide , these beautiful people will not be capable of operating devices created by advanced technology such as doorknobs and can openers . It will mean trouble for corporate America . It will be even worse for cats . <P> I think beautiful people are born with normal intelligence . But they quickly realize they do n't need to fill their brains with unpleasant concepts such as nonlinear geometry and fluid dynamics . Beautiful people know they will never be asked to build a communications satellite or invent a vaccine . They know they can get all the money they need by charging ugly people to look at them . This commerce takes many forms , including marriage , television and Cosmopolitan magazine . <P> My theory is that people become only as knowledgeable as they need to be , based on how ugly they are . I have no proof of this , but I can tell you that when I was four years old , I scanned my relatives and realized I would grow up to be a short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of an easy career in marketing , politics , modeling or acting as host of Hollywood Squares . People who look like me need skills . Lots of them . <P> As I tracked the spread of my uncle 's baldness  --  a predictor of my own hairline  --  I studied harder and harder to compensate . My uncle eventually got so bald that I became valedictorian . I 'm fairly certain that millions of other bespectacled , height-challenged introverts found academic excellence the same way . <P> The unpleasant truth is that corporate America depends on a steady supply of ugly people like me , people who know they wo n't survive by their looks alone . The cruel irony is that genetic engineers  --  themselves products of this smartening process  --  are threatening to dry up our wellspring of scientists and technologists  --  and the people who draw cartoons about them . <P> I try to ease my fears of the future by telling myself there will always be people who acquire skills for purely intrinsic reasons : perhaps for the love of learning , the thrill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say to myself , people ca n't be so shallow that they work only for money . I am highly persuaded by my own arguments until I talk to any other human being .
