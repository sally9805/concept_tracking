A professional forecaster who spent five years compiling the Encyclopedia of the Future offers his vision of events and developments that will affect our lives in the next millennium . // Predicting the future requires the perspective of history . The future is part of seamless continuum and emerges from roots deep in the past . For example , if we think of the computer as a computational device , we can trace its history back more than 4,000 years to the abacus . If we think of computers as merely the latest advance in the development of communications , the timeline traces back tens of thousands of years , or perhaps millioins if we include gestures and speech . Broadly speaking , there is nothing new under the sun ; there are only evolutionary adaptations to changes that are brought about by new understanding . Besides historical perspective , predicting the future requires special expertise . Because the storehouse of knowledge has become so vast and complex and the growth of knowledge is accelerating , advances in society are becoming increasingly dependent on people with specialized knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments in any field of inquiry , we usually consult those few experts at the tops of their fields . But there is a danger : Expertise and specialization can lead to parochialism and tunnel vision , limiting the specialist 's ability to see interconnections with other fields . Thus , professional futurists need to draw upon wideranging information from many areas . Futurists ' ability to see connections among many topics allows them to identify the broader impacts of various trends . It is this unique combination of perspective and expertise that enables futurists to see beyond current trends and construct useful forecasts about the future . Here is my best advice for gathering materials to provide a solid foundation for forecasts : Voracious reading is imperative . I regularly scan up to 60 different magazines , newsletters , and newspapers . I annually acquire and peruse 100-1,000 books focused on futuristic themes and areas of interest . I go out of my way to collect chronologies and timelines of important developments . I rely heavily on statistical compendia , almanacs , and chartbooks . I listen to or view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hire consultants to conduct global computer searches of scientific , technical , and professional literature databases on points whenever I am conducting specific research projects . Correspondence with experts on topics of interest , political leaders , and fellow futurists ' research is relentless . There are no shortcuts . The forecasts in this report are largely my own , based on data from a wide variety of authoritative sources , including the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics , government statistical reporting services , major trade and industryspecific journals , and other journals such as Vital Speeches of the Day , Future Survey , and national weekly news magazines ( U.S. News and World Report , Time , and Newsweek ) . For the most part , references to specific sources have been omitted for the sake of brevity . This article offers a variety of selected trends and forecasts , based on my 40 years of experience developing , implementing , and teaching foresight techniques , including five years organizing and editing the Encyclopedia of the Future . They offer insights that can help individuals build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communications 1 . Building the infostructure : Monumental investments are being made to develop and enhance the information superhighways . In the United States , a total of between $100 billion and $500 billion is being committed over the next several years to extend and upgrade competing information handling modes . 2 . Business investment in computer technologies represented half of all capital investment ( $1 trillion ) in the decade from 1984 to 1994 . Since 1991 , business devoted more capital spending to computer and communications hardware than to investments for factories , buildings , and other durables . Photograph // 3 . Information technologies are allowing increasing numbers of people to work at home . The number of home offices , 20.6 million in 1988 , may reach 60 million in 1998. 4 . Telecommuting and advances in videoconferencing will largely replace face-to-face business settings by 2020 . More than half of all workers in advanced Information Era societies will work out of their home or from decentralized offices . Infotech Breakthroughs 5 . Microprocessor chips will contain 1 billion transistors by 2011-a 100-fold increase over current chips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Satellite feed will become the most widespread transmission mode worldwide by 2010 , spurred by low-cost use and by less-developed countries leapfrogging costly hardwired infrastructures . 7 . Optical transmission of digital signals will grow from 80 gigabits per second in 1997 to beyond 100 gigabits per second by 2011 . ( A gigabit-one-billionth of a second-is to a second what a second is to 31.7 years . ) Scientists are already working on transmitting data in terabits ( one-trillionth of a second ) ; at this speed , the contents of the Library of Congress , estimated at 25 terabits , could be transmitted in just over five minutes . Consumer Electronics 8 . Computer use is accelerating . In 1995 , for the first time , Americans spent more money on computers than on televisions . An estimated 60 million individuals worldwide are now using the Internet , and users may number 130 million by 2000 . E-mail , introduced in 1982 , soared from 62 million active accounts in 1996 to 93.5 million in 1997 and will double by 2014. 9 . Portable phones are gaining popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer than 1 million in 1985 to more than 90 million currently and will grow to 330 million by 2001. 10 . Hand-held videophones will prove commercially successful by 2025 , and multipurpose flat-panel high-definition screens for computer , television , telephone , and other uses will become household staples by 2040. 11 . Electronic notebooks will supplant paper tablets by 2027 ; electronic publishing may surpass paper-based publishing by 2005 . One key driver in this trend is real estate : It 's too expensive to devote some 20% of office space to storing paper . Photograph // 12 . Voice recognition , voice synthesizing , and voice-activated computer systems will usher in a cascade of communication growth . Accompanied by palm-sized instantaneous translation programs , these voice-entry computers will be a boon to international tourism . Medical Breakthroughs 13 . Diagnostics will advance rapidly in the next 50 years . Traditional methods of diagnosing symptoms in the laboratory once took many weeks , often requiring hundreds of labor-intensive and costly experiments . In the future , doctors will use credit-card-sized diagnostic plates consisting of up to a million or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to verify diseases , deformities , and dysfunctions . Results will be read and analyzed by computers in just minutes . 14 . Wearable computerized health monitors will screen key body functions and provide real-time information on diet , exercise , and stressreduction requirements . 15 . Genetic research will yield ever more information about factors that predispose individuals to diseases and other health problems and will open up entirely new treatment and healing opportunities . 16 . Cloning technologies will be developed for prolonging life , for providing stockpiled spare body parts , and eventually for duplicating individual humans . Health , Lifestyles , and Values 17 . Too many people are getting too fat . The number of Americans who are clinically overweight and obese now exceeds the number at or below normal weight for the first time in history . 18 . Changing the dietary habits of Americans will get more emphasis over the next 70 years ; significant dietary changes typically require a generation to alter culturally embedded habits . Many will resort to antiobesity drugs and/or genetic engineering . 19 . Euthanasia may become common , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights over birth ) to death rights . New definitions of " death " will be heatedly debated . Soaring medical costs will influence views on death : Terminal illness and dying currently account for 10% of health-care outlays ; for Medicare , it 's 27% of program outlays. 20 . Ethical controversies will swirl around cloning , conception and contraception technologies , creation of new life-forms , and other related issues that force society to question the meaning of life itself . 21 . Eugenics will gain acceptance as humans take control over their own evolution . Animal and plant genetic manipulation opens the way to human biological engineering . Conception will be less a matter of chance and more a result of genetic screening and manipulation to maximize desirable traits and minimize undesirable ones . Population Growth 22 . Population on the planet grew by 80 million in 1996 , down from a peak increase of 87 million in 1980 . This is the equivalent of adding a " new United States " about every three years . Global population will double in the next 100 years , rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even 15 billion by 2100. 23 . The U.S. proportion of world population will fall from 4.7% of the total in 1994 to 4% by 2025 . Household Size 24 . Households are getting smaller . In Colonial times , households of five to seven persons were the norm . By 1900 , the number of persons per U.S. household averaged 4.76 , declining to 2.67 by 1994 . Average household size will continue to fall , reaching 2.35 by 2020 . Photograph // Graham T.T . Molitor , Forecaster // 25 . Household composition will also change , with more singles and mingles ( i.e. , housemates and cohabiting couples ) . Nuclear families consisting of a married couple with their children will have drastically declined due to liberalized divorce laws , postponement of first marriage , more out-of-wedlock births , increased social acceptance of cohabitation , effective birth-control technologies , and steeply escalating costs of raising children . 26 . Family units will wane and no longer be the primary social unit within the next several centuries : Patriarchal dominance will atrophy as women achieve fully equal rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of the young takes over . Aging 27 . Society will grow grayer . The proportion of Americans aged 65 and older has risen from 3% in 1870 to 12.6% in 1995 and may represent 21.5% of the population by 2030 and 27% by 2050 . Growing numbers of elderly will impose enormous demands on health-care delivery , particularly mental health and assisted care in nursing homes . 28 . Retirement age dropped from an average of 67 years in the early 1950s to 60 years in 1994 , but the trend toward early retirement will be reversed , rising to an average of 67 years in 2022 and 70 in 2025 , as Americans live healthier and longer lives . 29 . More age-centered political controversies will arise , especially over government spending . Programs for the elderly could increase from one-third of all federal spending to more than one-half by 2010 , pitting economic needs of YIPPIES ( young impoverished workers ) against WHOOPIES ( well-heeled older persons ) . 30 . Some enterprises will see gold in gray . Accommodating the needs of the elderly could mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed for people with reduced dexterity and vision ; publishers will produce more books with large type and more recorded books . Multiculturalism 31 . Immigration will continue to increase the overall U.S. population . Immigration will steadily increase racial , ethnic , and cultural diversity . By 2100 , persons of European descent will comprise less than 50% of the U.S. population . Hispanics now outnumber AfricanAmericans in 21 U.S. states and will become the largest ethnic minority by 2020 , comprising 15.7% of total population compared with 13.9% for blacks . 32 . Homogeneity will fade . Despite a long history of increasing diversity , the United States will likely see melting-pot homogeneity give way to a mosaic society , with periods of separatist conflict flaring up as ethnic enclaves seek to promote their group 's own interests . Business and the Economy 33 . The business of America is leisure ? Much activity in postindustrial economies has shifted to leisure , recreation , tourism , and hospitality sectors . Tourism already ranks as the second-largest employer in the United States and third-largest retail segment , with annual sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economic development are biotechnology and related life-sciences industries that will surpass tourism as a major economic activity in industrialized societies between 2200 and 2500 . Achieving mastery over the blueprints and mechanisms for creation itself will mark the major turning pont in human development . Agricultural efficiencies made possible by genetic engineering will dwarf those of the Green Revolution . 34 . Global competition will spur major U.S. manufacturers to shed capital-intensive production facilities , shift employment to low-wage jurisdictions , and minimize costly regulatory controls , such as those guarding worker safety and the environment . 35 . Companies will increasingly outsource capital-intensive functions , outreach through lower-cost media such as the Internet , and outdo rivals by offering products and services of higher perceived quality . 36 . Electronic commerce is taking over more and more of retail and wholesale commerce . Virtual corporations use communications technologies for instantaneous ordering and fulfillment , eliminating the need for costly production facilities , warehouses , and storefronts. 37 . Retail stores and wholesalers may largely disappear as the convenience and time savings of electronic shopping and home delivery alter consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . World Trade 38 . Globalization of trade means that everyone shares in increased prosperity . Between 1990 and 1996 , world trade volume rose from $7 trillion to $11 trillion . World trade is projected to reach $15 trillion-$16 trillion in 2000. 39 . China is now ranked as the world 's third-largest economy , based on purchasing power parity , behind the United States and Japan . If growth rates continue , China will become the largest economy worldwide in the next 15 to 20 years , possibly as early as 2010. 40 . Pacific Rim countries , including China , Japan , South Korea , New Zealand , Australia , Indonesia , the Philippines , Singapore , and Thailand , will account for more than half of world GNP by 2040. 41 . Regional preferential trading blocs will dominate the global economy over the next century . The European Community will grow to 25 members by 2010 . The American , Canadian , and Mexican trade zone may be expanded into a Free Trade of the Americas , embracing 34 Western Hemisphere democracies sometime between 2005 and 2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1916 , only a few hundred thousand people participated in the U.S. stock market . Now , thanks largely to retirement plans , 41% of American households have become stockholders. 43 . Personal debt is growing , putting a damper on consumer spending and savings . Mortgages and home-equity-loan payments totaled $4.22 trillion in 1993 , and installment payments on credit cards reached $1.17 trillion in 1996 . By mid-1997 , service payments on consumer debt approached 11.5% of disposable income , outpacing spending on food . Photograph // 44 . The number of personal bankruptcies climbed to 1.3 million in the United States in 1997 and will exceed 1.5 million by 2000 . Instead of accumulating wealth for the future , Americans are increasingly borrowing from the future . The costs of the big-ticket expenses they 're borrowing for-such as home mortgages , college tuition , and nursing-home care-are outpacing inflation . 45 . Education costs at private schools ( tuition , room , board , and fees ) more than doubled in 10 years in the United States , rising from an average rate of $25,514 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to double again by 2014 . Rising college costs will force growing numbers of parents to choose between saving for their retirements and paying for their children 's education . Energy Supply and Demand 46 . More oil will be imported . OPEC members supplied 25% of global oil in 1986 and 35%-45% in 1995 . By 2002 , two-thirds of U.S. petroleum will be imported . Half of the world 's oil will be supplied by OPEC members by 2020. 47 . Petroleum prices will soar as supplies dwindle to precariously low levels . By 2050 , petroleum and natural gas will no longer be burned as fuel but reserved , instead , for higher value-added uses such as plastics . 48 . Electricity demand worldwide will quadruple over the next 50 years , according to conservative estimates . ( The French Academy of Sciences projects as much as a ninefold increase. ) 49 . Electric power generating plants will increasingly rely on coal , of which there may be enough to meet global demands for 200-300 more years , or perhaps over 400-500 years , assuming enhanced efficiencies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following breakthroughs in high-temperature plasma fusion , which will become commercially viable by 2020 and offer the world a virtually limitless and cheap source of energy . Clean and safe fusion will become a panacea for global warming . 51 . Alternative energy sources are still prohibitively expensive compared with fossil fuels : 4c-5c per kilowatt hour for coal or gas ( 1993 ) , compared with 4c-7c for hydropower , 5c-8c for geothermal , 5c-9c for wind generation , 6c-8c for biomass , 10c-12c for solar power , and 30c-40c for photovoltaics . Alternative energies currently provide less than 1% of U.S. energy needs , and this share is unlikely to reach more than 5% within the next 25 years . Transportation 52 . The world 's fleet of cars will grow . There are currently some 625 million motor vehicles in use around the world , and the population of motor vehicles will grow to 1 billion by 2025. 53 . Traffic jams in the United States consumed an estimated 1.6 billion lost work hours in 1989 and will consume 8.1 billion work hours by 2005 . During 1997 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted fuel . Things will only get worse as the number of motor vehicles and the population increase and trip-generation per household escalates. 54 . Vehicles and drivers will increase by 25%-35% in 2010 . There will be an average of two vehicles for every U.S. household by 2020 , up from 1.68 in 1983 . Americans overwhelmingly prefer personal motor transportation , and few of the 89.7% of Americans currently using cars are likely to change their minds . Photograph // 55 . Automated highways and automated chauffeuring on highdensity roadways will reduce congestion , allowing 10 times as many vehicles in computer-controlled chains to travel in a lane . High costs associated with automated roadways-well over $1 trillion-will slow implementation . 56 . Motor vehicle emission taxes will be imposed by 2013 to curb urban pollution . The taxes will be scaled to weight , horsepower , motor efficiency , miles driven , and number of vehicles owned per driver . 57 . Superfast rail systems approaching speeds of 200 mph will collapse distances for exurban areas . Global perspectives will shrink as suborbital space travel becomes commercially available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 58 . The World : The number of countries before World War II was about 50 ; by 1995 , there were 256 . By the year 2025 , there may be 500 or more nation-states , but they will likely be linked together by thousands of treaties and agreements . 59 . Information : The world 's fund of information is doubling every two to two-and-a-half years . Scientific information doubles every five years , and scientific knowledge doubles every 10 years . Literature doubles every 10 to 15 years ; scientific articles double in four to five years . By the time a child born today finishes college , knowledge may have quadrupled ; by the time that child reaches age 50 , knowledge will have grown 32-fold . As much as 97% of world knowledge will be accumulated over one person 's lifetime . Continuing education becomes a fixed feature of infotech. 60 . Health-Care Costs : Healthcare costs soared past $1 trillion in 1996 in the United States , outpacing domestic inflation , and they are expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2000 . The percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 and 20% by 2033 . Rationing health care looms as a major political issue . Cost controls on open-ended healthcare delivery are in the offing . Incremental extension of publicly supported health care will help rescue individuals who are economically devastated or bankrupted by needs . 61 . Environment : Assaults on the environment are steadily and surely being reduced in advanced economies as they move from the era of heavy industry to the Information Era . The environment will continue to be a topmost political concern well into the twenty-first century . Conserving resources , minimizing ecological effects , and sustainability will be touchstones of the new survival ethic . The Global Commons will become the driving force of environmental protection . By 2030 , more than 50% of all household trash in the United States will be recycled . 62 . Packaging : Materials with sensors , combined with nanotechnologies , will make " smart " labels for food products feasible . These labels will calculate the passage of time and the humidity , temperature , and other physical conditions to which a packaged product is exposed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date or otherwise compromised . Plastics will account for more than 50% of all consumer packaging by 2015 ; universal symbols will be used to facilitate recycling of materials . 63 . Crime : U.S. crime rates will continue to decline slowly as the population of crime-prone young people shrinks as a proportion of the overall population . However , crime continues to rank among the top three concerns of Americans . Taxpayers increasingly will object to rising costs for incarcerating prisoners , especially when they realize it annually costs $25,000-$30,000 per inmate . 64 . Social Security : Birth rates and death rates are falling in the United States , creating greater numbers of elderly . Social Security trust funds will face insolvency between 2029 and 2036 . Social Security , left unchanged , will pile up an overwhelming $8-trillion deficit by 2070 ; decades of continuing reform will offer incremental relief . 65 . Leisure : Workweeks averaged 70 hours during early industrial times ( mid-1890s ) , then plummeted to 38.1 hours during 1980 , rebounding to 39.2 hours in 1996 . The average workweek will likely fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available . By 2010 , leisure time will account for over 50% of lifetime activities . Will the extra leisure time be spent for self-improvement ? It seems unlikely : Leisure time is dominated by sedentary pursuits such as watching television . In 1996 , media consumption accounted for 3,400 hours ( 40% of the average person 's time ) , compared with 2,900 hours for sleeping and 2,000 for working . And gambling will continue to be among the fastest-growing segments of the entertainment industry as growing leisure time , increasing affluence , and age-old greed propel interest . Trend extrapolation is not the only method of forecasting the future , but it is perhaps the most reliable weapon in the futurist 's arsenal . When surprises occur , it is tempting to suggest that predicting the future is impossible . For the most part , however , surprises and discontinuities can be traced through the evolution of past and present , and failing to forecast them accurately is a result of failing to do the tedious work of trend analysis . " Wild cards " such as meteor strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , history , cyclic patterns , and increasing knowledge concerning such phenomena provide a basis for projecting their probabilities . My basic premise in forecasting is that change almost never comes about as a bolt out of the unknown . The evolutionary pathways of the past into the present are well understood , and the direction of these pathways into the future can indeed be visualized and forecast by those with the perspective , expertise-and patience-to study trends . Photograph // Forecasts may not be surefire , but they are certainly better than spontaneous surmise or mere conjecture . Foresight enhances abilities to capitalize upon opportuntities , minimize ( or avoid ) adversities , gain lead time for responding , and assert leadership roles in managing change . The " prophetic past and present " provides the foundation for visionary thinking to guide future trends . Futurists are not captives but architects of destiny .
