<p> LEAVING LAS VEGAS ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> Ben Sanderson Nicolas Cage <p> Sera Elisabeth Shue <p> Yuri Julian Sands <p> Peter Richard Lewis <p> Terri Valeria Golino <p> Written and directed by Mike Figgis . Running time : 112 minutes . Rated R ( for strong sexuality and language , violence and pervasive alcohol abuse ) . Opening today at Pipers Alley . <p> Oh , this movie is so sad ! It is sad not because of the tragic lives of its characters , but because of their goodness and their charity . What moves me the most in movies is not when something bad happens , but when characters act unselfishly . In " Leaving Las Vegas , " a man loses his family and begins to drink himself to death . He goes to Vegas , and there on the street he meets a prostitute , who takes him in and cares for him , and he calls her his angel . But he does n't stop drinking . <p> The man 's name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Sera ( Elisabeth Shue ) . You will not see two better performances this year . Midway in the film someone offers Ben the insight that his drinking is a way of killing himself . He smiles lopsidedly and offers a correction : " Killing myself is a way of drinking . " At one point , after it is clear that Sera really cares for him , he tells her , " You can never , ever , ask me to stop drinking . " She replies in a little voice : " I know . " <p> The movie is not really about alcoholism . It is about great sad passion , of the sort celebrated in operas like " La Boheme . " It takes place in bars and dreary rented rooms and the kind of Vegas poverty that includes a parking space and the use of the pool . The practical details are not quite realistic  --  it would be hard to drink as much as Ben drinks and remain conscious , and it is unlikely an intelligent prostitute would allow him into her life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the real subject of this movie , which is that we must pity one another , and be gentle . <p> Ben was a movie executive . Something bad happened in his life , and his wife and son are gone . Is he divorced ? Are they dead ? It is never made clear . <p> " I 'm not sure if I lost my family because of my drinking , or if I 'm drinking because I lost my family , " he muses . The details would not help , because this is not a case history but a sad love song . Cage , a resourceful and daring actor , has never been better . <p> Consider an opening scene where Ben attempts to make jokey small talk with some former colleagues who have long since written him off as a lost cause . He desperately needs money because he needs a drink  --  now , right now ! He is shaking . He may go into convulsions . Yet he manufactures desperately inane chatter , dropping famous names . Finally one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and says , " I think it would be best if you did n't contact me again . " Minutes later , brought back to life by alcohol , he is trying to pick up a woman at a bar : " You smell good , " he says . She catches a whiff of his breath : " You 've been drinking all day . " <p> What could possibly attract Sera , the prostitute , to this wounded man ? We learn a little about her , in closeups where she talks about her life to an invisible therapist . She is proud of the way she controls her clients and sets the scenarios . She is adamant that none of them is ever really allowed to know her . She has an abusive relationship with a pimp ( Julian Sands ) , and we can guess that she probably also had an abusive father ; it usually works out that way . The pimp is soon out of the picture , and " Leaving Las Vegas " becomes simply the story of two people . Perhaps she likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes him in as she might take in a wet puppy . <p> It is unclear to what extent he fully understands his circumstances . At times he hallucinates . He calls her his " angel " fancifully , but there are moments when she literally seems to be an angel . He hears voices behind the walls . He shakes uncontrollably . He asks her , " How did our evening go ? " There is a curious , effective scene in which he tries to get a check cashed , and his hands shake too much to sign his name . He goes off to drink himself into steadiness , and then it seems he returns and makes obscene suggestions to the teller , but they all take place in his head . <p> Mike Figgis , who wrote , directed , and composed the music for this movie , is a filmmaker attracted to the far shores of behavior . Here he began with a novel by a man named John O'Brien , whose autobiographical sources can be guessed by the information that he killed himself two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project was n't compromised , Figgis shot it as an independent film , using Super 16 cameras to " grab " Las Vegas locations . The outdoor scenes feel unrehearsed and real . <p> The movie works as a love story , but really romance is not the point here , any more than sex is . The story is about two wounded , desperate , marginal people , and how they create for each other a measure of grace . One scene after another finds the right note . If there are two unplayable roles in the stock repertory , they are the drunk and the whore with a heart of gold . Cage and Shue make these cliches into unforgettable people . Cage 's drunkenness is inspired in part by a performance he studied , Albert Finney 's alcoholic consul in " Under the Volcano . " You sense an observant intelligence peering from inside the drunken man , seeing everything , clearly and sadly . <p> Shue 's prostitute is however the crucial role , because Sera is the one with a choice . She sees Ben clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ride . When he lets her down badly , toward the end of the movie , she goes out and does something that no hooker should do  --  gets herself into a motel room with a crowd of drunken college boys  --  and we see how she needed Ben because she desperately needed to do something good for somebody . He was her redemption , and when it seems he scorns her gift , she punishes herself . <p> " Leaving Las Vegas " is one of the best films of the year , deserving many Academy Award nominations . That such a film gets made is a miracle : One can see how this material could have been softened and compromised , and that would have been wrong . It is a pure , grand gesture . That he is an alcoholic and she works the streets are simply the turnings they have taken . Beneath their occupations are their souls . And because Ben essentially has given up on his , the film becomes Sera 's story , about how @x As hordes of applicants mob the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever more qualifications to stand out from the crowd . And , unfortunately , it takes ever more money these days to fund the graduate courses that upgrade a job seeker 's skills and rsum . That will most likely only get worse . Budget cuts and endowment declines are expected to drive up tuition and reduce aid for graduate students this year . Deans of professional programs in areas such as business , engineering , and library science warn applicants that grants and fellowships will be in short supply in 2009 . In addition , as the unemployment rate rises , fewer employers feel the need to offer sweeteners such as graduate school tuition assistance . What 's more , most professional grad programs are so intense that --  especially in the first year --  deans typically warn against trying to raise cash by working part time , a common strategy for funding undergraduate degrees . But financing grad school is still possible , says William Gray , who persuaded his employer , PRTM Management Consultants , to subsidize his M.B.A . studies at the University of Virginia 's Darden School of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard work to find and impress such a generous employer . But , he says , " I know for a fact that more people could do this . " That is , indeed , one of many options , including generous new loan programs and protected funding for top students . In addition , growing competition for bright candidates may provide lower cost options for study . Thanks , also , to many long-established aid programs . The military and state and federal health agencies are expected to continue offering assistance to those willing to serve a few years in jobs that need filling . Some graduate programs will still award at least partial financial aid to students whose FAFSA ( www.fafsa.ed.gov ) or Need Access ( www.needaccess.org ) forms prove that they have low income . Top students , especially those interested in research , can get assistantships or stipends covering tuition and minimal living costs . And many schools , especially private institutions , will offer partial tuition scholarships ( essentially discounts ) to students who they think will bring something special . Grad school deans say there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial help in these hard times : Apply to wealthier schools . Public universities in states with stronger economies , and schools with endowments large enough or managed well enough to weather Wall Street 's collapse , have more money to hand out . Gregory Fenves , dean of the University of Texas 's engineering school , notes that his state --  like several others rich in oil --  has so far avoided the worst of the rest of the nation 's economic troubles . As of early this year , he expected his budget for the fall 's financial aid to rise slightly , enabling him to fund just about all Ph.D . candidates , as well as master 's applicants , who express an interest in research . At his school , he explains , " at the graduate level , it is all merit-based aid . " Anyone who wants funding will need good grades and test scores and will have to " be clear in their statements and essays about what particular research area they are interested in , and why . " Apply early . To lock up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers and demanding quicker commitments , says Michael Lesk , who chairs Rutgers 's Department of Library and Information Science . His department starts sending out offers by February . " We 've given away all the financial aid " by late spring , he says . Work the competition . The growing number of professional graduate programs , especially online , is sparking price competition . About 1,000 universities now offer master 's degrees in business , for example , up from about 700 in 2002 . One , California State University-Dominguez Hills , is luring out-of-state students to its online program with comparatively low prices : Tuition for all 20 classes needed for an M.B.A . should total less than $20,000 . Think long term . Julia Mortyakova , president of the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students , says students need to think realistically about their careers and salary prospects before investing time in or spending borrowed money on graduate degrees . Many applicants with grandiose ideas about becoming professors , for example , are likely to be disappointed , because the latest economic troubles have not only reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating openings . Mortyakova , a pianist who is studying for her doctorate in keyboard performance at the University of Miami , adds , however , that for those passionate about a career as a professor , lawyer , dentist , or other professional , a recession is a good time to buckle down to graduate school . " Going to graduate school is a great thing to do if you ca n't find a job , " she says . Who knows ? Once you graduate , that shiny new degree might be just the little extra edge that gets you noticed by employers .
