<p> Consider this : If you eat four small chocolate chip cookies - absorbing some 200 calories - you 'll need to pound pavement or pump pedals for at least a half-hour to work them off . <p> Occasionally , you can compensate by cutting other calories out of your diet . But if you keep skipping the exercise , the calories in all those cookies will turn to fat in your thighs , your heart and other places . <p> By now , most researchers agree : Eating without exercising is risky . You can drop weight by controlling what you eat , but you are unlikely to keep the weight off and stay healthy without regular workouts . <p> To reduce body fat - but minimize the loss of muscle and bone tissue while you diet - you need to exercise three to five times a week . That means at least 30-minute sessions of brisk walking , swimming , jogging , cycling or cross-country skiing , says Mary Ellen Sweeney , associate medical director of Emory University 's Health Enhancement Program . Exercising less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those recommendations may seem feasible . But plugging them into daily life will take special maneuvering by the six volunteers taking part in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 's Diet of a Lifetime program that began in mid-January . <p> Pediatric cardiologist William Plauth has been trying to squeeze in a lunchtime walk during his 14-hour days at Egleston Hospital , but every time he steps outside , his beeper goes off . At night , after making follow- up phone calls from home , he would rather relax in front of the TV with his family than confront his stationary bike in the bedroom . <p> Atlantan Kristen Wissore , who troubleshoots computer crashes around the country , ca n't call a time-out , either , to exercise . She tries to lodge in hotels that have gyms , but after working all day , she often ca n't muster the energy to use them . <p> It might inspire these dieters to know exactly how exercise speeds and maintains weight loss - but researchers do n't have the answers yet . Data simply proves that exercise does both . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Thomas A. Wadden , director of the Center for Health Behavior at Syracuse University in New York . " Feeling better may promote better eating habits - but we do n't know the mechanisms . " <p> He and his colleagues have been able to unlock some of the mystery of metabolism . In a landmark study he conducted in 1990 at the University of Pennsylvania , Dr. Wadden appears to have disproved the widely held idea that diets ultimately fail because they lower metabolism . <p> During the 48-week experiment he conducted with 18 dieters , he tested their resting metabolic rate - the rate of calories burned to maintain heartbeat , temperature and other basic functions . That rate did drop initially as their weight fell . <p> But when these dieters who had been exercising all along were taken off their very low-calorie diets , their metabolisms rose to a level befitting their new body size . <p> This is good news . If dieting had permanently lowered the dieters ' metabolic rates , they would have been unable to burn calories quickly and probably would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , the metabolism adapts . <p> The effect of exercise on metabolism is still in dispute , but Dr. Wadden is convinced by a yearlong Stanford study . People in the experiment who lost weight by dieting alone saw their metabolism rates drop ; but the metabolism rates of people who lost weight by moderately exercising and not dieting remained stable . <p> Researchers at the University of California at Davis found , however , that very strenuous exercise combined with dieting forced metabolic rates down , not up . Dr. Wadden considers that an adaptive response consistent with the other findings . <p> When calories are cut , the body lowers its metabolic rate to preserve the muscle tissue needed to stay alive , he says . With strenuous exercise , " the body says , ' I 'm being starved , and now this idiot is running 15 , 20 miles a day - then I 'm really going to turn down the furnace to conserve some of this energy . ' " <p> Like strenuous exercise , moderate exercise burns calories - without posing as great a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining and building the lean body tissue in muscles and organs , such as the liver . This tissue is more metabolically active and needs extra energy to function : So the more lean body tissue you have , the higher your resting metabolic rate will be , Dr. Sweeney says . <p> The main purpose of fat , on the other hand , is to store excess calories . It is far less metabolically active , needs less energy , and weighs the body down . <p> Based on these findings , weight-loss experts tend to recommend moderate exercise for losing 5 or 10 pounds , or a combination of exercise and dieting to drop more pounds . But , they warn , strenuous , daily workouts while dieting will backfire . <p> The bottom line is " there is no pill or food that will increase your metabolic rate , " Dr. Sweeney says . If you want to lose weight , you have to work at it , adhering to an exercise routine that is challenging - but also convenient and realistic . <p> If you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Margarette Williamson , one of the registered dietitians supervising the Journal-Constitution 's six dieters . <p> Dr. Plauth , for instance , was complaining that exercising in the bedroom bored him and ate up the little time he had for his wife and son . Ms. Williamson suggested a compromise : move the stationary bike into the living room and exercise with family around . <p> In the meantime , Dr. Plauth is attacking the boredom another way : with classical music booming through his headset in the bedroom . He 's also taking on the stairs at Egleston . <p> " Now that I 've lost weight on lower-fat foods , I do n't feel as bloated , " he says . " So I 'm encouraged to move more and move faster . " <p> Ms. Williamson is urging Ms. Wissore to put a set of floor exercises to music , in a tape she can carry with her wherever she goes . An alternative is traveling with exercise videos that she can use in her room . <p> ( Exercise videos should provide a warmup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also specify the level of effort required . ) <p> Dieter Diane Walker , a Conyers homemaker with three boys , makes exercise a family affair , bringing everybody out to play basketball on weekends . During the week , she takes an hourlong walk as soon as her husband gets home . On rainy days , she uses a treadmill . <p> For others , the best tack may be to join a nearby gym that offers structured classes - or a team that demands regular attendance . <p> Even Dr. Sweeney , an internist specializing in weight management , has had to take extra steps to lose the weight she gained before her baby 's birth . She has joined a gym with a nursery , and she works out at lunchtime . <p> At home , she 's already teaching her 9-month-old the joys of speed . After Dr. Sweeney ties on her running shoes , she plunks her baby into a jogging stroller and they fly down the street , together . <p> " Anything will help , " she says , " even regular walking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal-Constitution 's Diet of a Lifetime program , our six volunteers report their progress .
