Buenaventura 's Freshwater Spring WHEN BUENAVENTURA MENDIZABAL , Quintin 's father , arrived on the island , he built himself a wooden cottage on the far side of Alamares Lagoon , a forgotten stretch of land that had been only partially cleared of wild vines and thickets . There was a spring nearby which the residents of the area had once used . A stone fountain built around it had been maintained by a caretaker , since it was considered public property . In recent years , however , people had forgotten all about it . The caretaker , an arthritic old man who lived next to the spring , had stopped keeping it up , and soon the mangrove swamp had enveloped it completely . Half a kilometer down the beach stood the beautiful houses of Alamares , one of the most exclusive suburbs of San Juan . Alamares stood on a strip of land crossed by a palm-crested avenue - Ponce de Leon Avenue - with water on either side : the Atlantic Ocean to the north , and Alamares Lagoon to the south . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic , where the surf was always swelling and battering the sand dunes ; and the more private one opened onto the quiet beach of the lagoon . This beach ended in a huge mangrove swamp , and only the tip of it was visible from Alamares . When he moved to the area , Buenaventura built a modest cottage precisely at this site , where the mangrove swamp met the private beach of the lagoon . The swamp was a mysterious place , full of exotic wildlife and strange botanical specimens , with creatures both amphibious and terrestrial . The mangroves had bushy tops with all sorts of birds nesting in them . The white heron roosted there , and at sundown turned the branches of the trees a ghostly white , as if a snowstorm had just blown through . Albatross were often seen gliding over the swamp , looking for a safe place to spend the night , and from time to time one could even see a tiger-eyed guaraguao , the nearly extinct local eagle , perched on one of its branches . But the mangroves were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the water . Inside this labyrinth of knots and sinews a whole universe of mollusks , crustaceans , and fish proliferated freely , half immersed in the mud , half encrusted in the mossy cartilage of the wood . It was a strange territory to navigate in , and although several wide channels crossed it from end to end , if one were to get lost in its tangle , there was only a slim chance of finding one 's way out . Following the waterways , one came eventually to Morass Lagoon - thus named by the Spanish explorers and later renamed Molasses Lagoon by the slum 's inhabitants - and after crossing it would finally end up in Lucumi Beach . A sugar mill , the Central Oromiel , had been established on the lagoon 's shores and emptied the foul-smelling sludge from its rum distillery into its quiet waters , turning the lagoon into a quagmire . The sugar mill had closed down at the beginning of the twentieth century , but the waters were still contaminated . Many of the city 's sewers emptied into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way than pollute the white sand beaches , which tourists had begun to visit . On the shores of Morass Lagoon was one of the city 's worst slums , Las Minas . Most of the servants who worked in the houses of the elegant suburb of Alamares lived there , and frequently crossed the intricate waterways of the mangrove swamp in their rowboats . Ponce de Leon Avenue , the capital 's longest boulevard , began in the Old City , cut straight across Puerta de Tierra , and converged into Alamares , before losing itself in the distance as it penetrated the country 's interior . When Buenaventura moved into the area there were still a good number of old-fashioned horse-drawn carriages driving by , as well as fashionable Stutz Bear Cats , Packards , and Silver Clouds belonging to the affluent residents . Everyone knew everyone else in Alamares and waved cheerfully from their motor seats , dressed in white cotton jackets to keep off the dust from the road and wearing rubber-rimmed goggles that made them look like owls . In the afternoon , when nannies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they always preferred to stroll down the sidewalk of Ponce de Leon Avenue , where the wind from the ocean playfully pulled at their starched aprons and coifs . There the Atlantic broke in long blue waves over the bathers , who had to swim energetically to keep their heads above the crests of the waves . The nannies felt secure and invigorated . But when they walked down the quiet beach path which bordered Alamares Lagoon , they insisted they could hear strange moans coming from the nearby swamp that reminded them , they said , of things dying or being born . Once the sun began to go down , mysterious lights sometimes glowed through the bushes ; crabs and lizards crept through the undergrowth . For this reason no one walked in the direction of Buenaventura 's half-hidden cottage at the end of the lagoon at dusk . One day the caretaker of the spring was found dead , lying by the rim of the fountain , from a mysterious blow to the head . A small item appeared in the morning papers . but nobody paid much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents of Alamares did n't need water from the spring any longer , since they were connected to the city 's aqueduct . Soon after that , Buenaventura moved to the caretaker 's house and nobody seemed to mind . He cleared the spring of undergrowth and put it back in use . Afterward , Buenaventura married Rebecca Arrigoitia and took her to live with him on the shores of Alamares Lagoon . The caretaker 's fate was a stroke of good luck for Buenaventura . Since the outbreak of the First World War , San Juan Bay had been filled with merchant marine ships , as well as navy destroyers that would sail past the looming stone walls of San Felipe del Morro , the Old City 's largest medieval fort , crowned with Spanish cast-iron cannons , to anchor not far from Alamares Lagoon . There were so many ships that the municipal aqueduct could not supply fresh water for all of them , and before long the captains of the Spanish merchant ships , like the Virgen de Purrua and the Virgen de Altagracia , came knocking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fresh water from his spring . Buenaventura felt it his duty to oblige and he did all he could to accommodate them . There was no other well for twenty miles around , and Spanish ships were always left for last , since government officials in the city were understandably partial to serving those merchant ships which sailed under the American flag . Yet , despite the increasing American influence , there was always a lively market for Spanish foods on the island : most well-to-do people favored the paella valenciana , Segovian sobreasada , ensaimadas from Mallorca , and other such tasty dishes over American-style food . Trade with Spain was impossible to eliminate completely . Buenaventura was , above all , a good Spaniard , and he never pressed his countrymen to pay cash for his services . He preferred to exchange his water casks for a few cases of the Riojas and Logronos which the Spanish captains brought him . In turn , he would sell them to his customers in the city at a favorable price . Soon after he arrived on the island , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small warehouse next to his spring . There he stored his wines ; the ruby-red hams he began to import from Valdeverdeja , his hometown ; the ivory-white asparagus from Aranjuez ; the honeyed nougats and marzipans from Jijona ; and the exquisite Moorish olives from Seville . He brought most of his goods into the island illegally in flat , covered barges that navigated through the mangrove swamp . The barges would load their merchandise off the deserted coves of Lucumi Beach , where the Spanish merchant ships arriving from Europe made discreet stops before going on to the port of San Juan . Buenaventura Arrives on the Island When Buenaventura arrived on the island in the Virgen de Covadonga , he was twenty-three years old and without a cent to his name . An orphan since he had turned fifteen , he was raised in Spain by two maiden aunts , who set great store by his good looks . He was six feet tall , tan-skinned and dark-haired , and had eyes so blue they made you want to sail out to sea every time you looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival when we were first engaged to be married , and many years later he repeated it from time to time for our two boys , Manuel and Willie , to remind them of who they were and where they came from . All during his trip across the Atlantic , Buenaventura had wondered what the island of Puerto Rico would be like . He had read something about the history of the Caribbean before setting sail from Cadiz , but he had also learned much of it firsthand . The Spanish-American War , which had ended nineteen years before , was still fresh in the mind of many Spaniards . He knew his country had fought tooth and nail to keep Cubal the last jewel in the crown of the Spanish empire . After the Seven Years ' War , in 1763 , Spain had traded Florida for Cuba to the British . Later , thousands of Buenaventura 's countrymen had died at Punta Brava , Dos Rios , Camaguey , shot down in bloody combat by Cuban rebels during the Revolution . But when Spain lost the Spaniards-American War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island too poor and not worth fighting for , Buenaventura asked himself . Or was Spain just too exhausted to go on fighting ? Buenaventura landed in the port of San Juan on July . 4 , 1917 , the same day President Woodrow Wilson signed the Jones Act , which granted us American citizenship . Luis Munoz Rivera . the bill 's chief proponent and our Resident Commissioner , had died the year before and President Wilson , in deference to his memory , had signed the new bill with the Resident Commissioner 's gold pen . Munoz Rivera was a poet as well as a statesman , and like many of the island 's politicians at the time , he juggled American interests with nationalist conceits , fighting for Puerto Rico 's independence on the sly . As Buenaventura 's ship dropped anchor in the harbor , the festivities celebrating our brand-new American citizenship were going full blast . Now each of us would have the right to an American passport , a talisman so powerful it opened doors all over the world . For nineteen years , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1898 , we had lived in a political limbo . Spain had given us our autonomy six months before the Americans arrived , but we were never granted Puerto Rican citizenship . We still traveled with a Spanish passport , and lost it at the end of the Spanish-American War . A new document had not been issued , and for a while we were citizens of nowhere at all . Not to be citizens of any country , however insignificant , was uncomfortable enough . Then we were told we could n't travel anywhere . The greater part of our island 's bourgeoisie consisted of seafaring immigrants , people from the Canary Islands . the Balearics , and Corsica , as well as from mainland Spain and France . Some had come to the island from Venezuela , and others from neighboring Caribbean islands , fleeing the wars of independence , which inevitably brought ruin - if not death - to the well-to-do settlers . They were used to traveling freely to and from the Continent , migrating with the seasons . Travel was imperative to establishing stable commercial relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorer every year . For this reason , our brand-new American citizenship was hailed as a godsend , and a first-class celebration was in order . We would now have a definite identification with the most powerful country in the world , and the golden eagle would be stamped on the cover of our passport . Henceforth , we would cherish it as our magic shield : we could travel anywhere , no matter how far or exotic our destination ; we had the inalienable right to political asylum at the local American Embassy ; and the American ambassador would be our civil servant . Buenaventura disembarked from the Virgen de Covadonga and found lodging near the wharf where the ship had docked . Don Miguel Santiesteban , a longtime friend of his family who had immigrated from Extremadura some years before , owned a warehouse at La Puntilla , the harbor area where most of the merchants ' depots were . Buenaventura dropped off his satchel , put on his black sombrero Cordobes , and walked up the street to where the festivities were in full swing . The heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel of the bay . Buenaventura walked along the harbor , admiring the Mississippi and the Virginia , steamships anchored at the dock , decorated with streamers flapping gaily in the wind . He passed the new Federal Post Office and admired the impressive pink Federal Customs House . A handsome new building , it had guava-colored pinnacles on the roof and garlands of ceramic grape-fruits and pineapples decorating the windowsills . Near the Customs House was the National City Bank , which reminded him of a Corinthian temple . Several gaily painted pushcarts were parked under the huge laurel tree in the plaza , selling " hot dogs , " a snack which was evidently very popular because the line of people went around the Post Office building . Buenaventura asked what " hot dog " meant and burst out laughing when he was told . He bought one and it did n't taste like dog meat at all ; it reminded him , instead , of a cross between salami and a German wiener . Another vendor sold beer from a barrel , but it was warm and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a glass of red wine from Valdeverdeja . He settled for a glass of fresh sugarcane juice , which he found delicious . As he walked on , the Atlantic glimmered at the end of the street like a jewel . He felt as if he were still on deck ; the road was paved with large polished blue bricks , and for a moment it seemed to be rocking gently under his feet . A huge crowd gathered on the sidewalk and he stood on a corner to watch the Fourth of July parade go by . A lady standing near him , wearing a starched white cap with a red cross sewn on it , gave him a small American flag . " You must wave it above your head when Governor Yager arrives , " she said to him , " and call out God Bless America ' as he rides by in his open convertible . " He took the flag and thanked her , doffing his hat . Nearby was the new capitol - still under construction - the dome of which was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Monticello , " as someone proudly told him on the street . He looked at the corner sign and noticed that the avenue was named after Juan Ponce de Leon , one of the Spanish Conquistadors , and his heart skipped a beat . Several floats went by , pulled by army mules and covered from top to bottom with American flags . From them waved a chorus of beautiful girls with red , white , and blue sashes draped across their chests - the names of the States of the Union written in glittering silver dust . A mob of barefoot children stood cheering on the sidewalk ; they were brought there from the public elementary school by the superintendent , who was dressed in black and carried a bowler hat in his hand . It was the first public school on the island , a passerby confided to Buenaventura , completely funded by the American government . Every time a float went by , the children cheered and waved their flags spiritedly , but they shouted the most when they saw Uncle Sam walk by on stilts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue stripes on them , his top hat aglitter with silver stars . He threw handfuls of brand-new pennies at the crowd , and they gleamed on the ground like gold . Buenaventura observed everything around him with a keen eye . He had come to the island to stay , and any knowledge about his new situation would help him get settled . He noticed that the people sitting on the dais , at the foot of the unfinished capitol , and the soldiers marching down the avenue were foreigners . Most of them were blond , tall , and well-built , whereas the natives were of sallow complexion , medium height , and a delicate frame . The well-to-do had parked their open carriages and motors on the side of the avenue and were watching the parade from the comfort of their leather seats , sitting under opened parasols . They were fashionably dressed , the men in dark cloth coats and the women in white cotton percale , with intricate lace frills at the neck and sleeves . The people standing on the sidewalk looked thin and pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they were in good spirits . Most of them were barefoot and wore straw hats on their heads , with the fringe turned down to shade their faces from the blazing sun . A tall man with a large mustache , wearing a tuxedo and top hat , was sitting next to a large-bosomed lady carrying a wide-brimmed hat with a silk cabbage rose pinned on the side . Buenaventura found out from his chatty neighbor on the sidewalk that they were the governor and his wife . A detachment of cadets marched behind the Marine band , wearing red caps with patent-leather visors and carrying their rifles on their right shoulders . They marched down Ponce de Leon Avenue to the beat of Sousa 's Semper Fidelis . Buenaventura liked the music immensely ; he found it so inspiring he almost went two-stepping along behind them . Any nation that marched to that kind of music was bound to be optimistic , he thought . He would like very much to belong to it . The scathing heat , the screaming children-none of it would matter as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . His native land was very different . Spain was a decaying country ; its buildings were crumbling with age and everything seemed outdated . In Valdeverdeja , water was still sold house to house from earthenware jars hauled by mules , and the villagers went around in two-wheeled carts pulled by donkeys . It seemed to him that his countrymen had been disenchanted with the world from the time of Segismundo , Calderon de la Barca 's hero , and that skepticism had sapped their spirits . They did n't believe in anything anymore-not in the values of patriotism , not in the dogmas of faith . Religion was no more than a convention of respectability . But here the young men were full of spirit as they marched down the avenue ; he could see it in their eyes , which shone with enthusiasm every time the cry " God bless America and America will bless you ! " was heard from one of the bystanders . Buenaventura was still standing there watching the parade when someone announced through a loudspeaker that all citizens over twenty-one were expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tables would be set up at the end of Ponce de Leon Avenue once the festivities were over . Suddenly people began to run here and there , calling to one another excitedly . Buenaventura thought that , despite all the hoopla about the new citizenship , the natives would n't risk their skins for it , and would run home and hide under the bed . But the reverse happened . In no time at all , there was a line of several dozen young men eagerly waiting to sign up beside Uncle Sam 's portrait , and in less than three hours the quotas were filled . " They must have good reason to leave . I 'm beginning to suspect famine on this island has been even worse than in Valdeverdeja , " he wrote to a friend in a letter he sent home the next day . " I 'm amazed at the eagerness with which the young men of San Juan lined up to board the Buford , the military transport ship anchored at the wharf . In Extremadura it 's not surprising if people want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dried-up leather , and everyone wants to leave . But this place is as green as the Garden of Eden , and no one can go hungry . One has only to squat by the roadside and shit a few guava ' seeds , and in no time a full-blown tree is growing there , laden with fruit and flowers . Puerto Rico must have been a miser 's paradise in days gone by , and who knows but it may still be so today . " Buenaventura had acquired an accountant 's certificate in Spain , but it did n't do him much good here , because it did n't conform to federal standards . It was proof of his experience , though , and he went searching for work in the city 's commercial district with his certificate in his pocket . As he passed by the wharf , he saw a ship loaded with casks of rum which were being thrown overboard by the crew in view of a group of government officials . He asked what they were doing and they said the cargo 's owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been imposed on the island . Buenaventura marveled that the islanders should want so fervently to be good American citizens . They had been drinking rum practically from the cradle , and he did n't see how giving up liquor was going to make them better citizens . Farther down the street , he came to an open circular building , a wooden arena with bleachers all around , where a cockfight was about to take place . People were placing bets and yelling , ready to pit two cocks against each other . Two men blew mouthfuls of rum into the birds ' beaks to make them more aggressive , and everyone was drinking openly . Apparently , rum was not forbidden at cockfights . The men were affixing razor blades to the spurs of the struggling fowl and they glinted in the sun like tiny scythes . Buenaventura had seen plenty of bullfights in Valdeverdeja . But when the men let the cocks loose and one of them in a minute trailed its innards in the sawdust , he suddenly felt like vomiting and had to leave . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote another long letter to his friend back in Extremadura . " Here islanders have kept many African rites alive . It 's going to be difficult to teach the Congolese and Yorubas the good manners of the Mayflower . " To a cousin in Madrid he remarked : " Soon this place will be a fakir 's paradise , where everybody will live on air . The present war in Europe has made the economy more precarious , but the main concern of the islanders is to prove to the United States that they can be good American citizens . Their most popular refrain at present is Food can be as effective as bullets . ' They have tightened their belts dramatically , cutting down on their intake of flour , sugar , rice ? and milk , and donated the proceeds to the troops fighting overseas , so that American soldiers will be better fed . " The sale of Liberty Bonds has been extraordinarily successful , and even public-school children have bought some of them with their penny savings . Although hungry and often dressed in rags , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eighty-three dollars in bonds , their contribution to the defense of the powerful nation that has adopted them . Sometimes they 're so generous they remind me of Don Quixote. "
