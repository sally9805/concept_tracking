<p> WHEN German Chancellor Helmut Kohl visits east Germany after Easter , he 's more likely to be the target of soft tomatoes and rotten eggs than of wild praise , as he was a year ago . <p> The German economic experiment , the first of its kind in the world , is proving to be extremely painful for the 8 million workers east of the Elbe River . <p> Tens of thousands of east Germans now protest weekly against soaring unemployment . About 2.7 million people , or 34 percent of the work force , are either out of work or working reduced hours . An unemployment rate of 40 percent or even 50 percent this year is quite possible , economists warn . And east Germans continue to move westward , at a rate of 18,500 a month . <p> Mr. Kohl is pelted by criticism these days , but oddly , a key criticism has little to do with his economic decisions . Rather , he is accused of not having adequately prepared the east Germans for hardship and of not supporting them emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old border , as western Germans view eastern Germans as impatient ingrates and east Germans bristle at the " know-it-all " attitude of the westerners . Kohl , meanwhile , has not appeared publicly in the former East Germany since his campaigning for Dec. 2 elections . <p> " Where the government has really failed is in communication , " says Hans Martin Kolle , economics editor for the weekly Rheinischer Merkur , voicing a widely held opinion in Bonn . Kohl should take a tip from former President Reagan " and make use of the television , " he says . <p> The monetary union of last summer at the extraordinary artificial high rate of 1 to 1 for individuals and 2 to 1 for business is a key reason for the plummet downhill in the east German economy . Western cars were suddenly available at half the price of the sputtering , dinky east German Trabants , for instance . Meanwhile , all-important trade with Eastern Europe , especially the Soviet Union , dried up for lack of hard currency . <p> Bundesbank President Karl Otto Pohl said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But neither he , nor Kohl 's political opposition , call it the wrong decision . At that time , Kohl had no choice , they admit . He was under intense political pressure to stanch the flow of East Germans moving westward . <p> The government 's general policy is to rely on free-market forces to rebuild eastern Germany . The last few months have shown , however , that the private sector is not kicking in fast enough to significantly slow the rate at which the economy is deteriorating , although Kohl still says the standard of living in both halves of the country will be comparable in three to five years . <p> In February , Bonn tried to sweep away hurdles to investment and help bridge the time gap between economic collapse and significant investment by introducing a program called " Upswing East . " <p> " It 's a big step forward , " says Peter Blume , spokesman for the Association of German Industry and Chambers of Commerce , a leading business organization . He believes the program has solved a key problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cases of disputed ownership . He also says that because of the program , " there are now enough tax incentives and subsidies " for investors , amounting to a reimbursement of 49 percent of investment costs . <p> Upswing East also earmarked 12 billion marks ( $7 billion ) for eastern Germany , on top of the 80 billion marks provision in this year 's budget , 35 billion marks from the German unity fund , and an expected 70 billion marks over the next two years from the private sector . The European Community , meanwhile will be assisting the region with 1.8 billion marks this year . The grand total for this year is roughly 163 billion marks ( $95 billion ) . <p> There is enough money available , all sides agree . " The government has been generous with financing , " says Wolfgang Ullmann , a Bundestag ( parliament ) representative from the east German industrial state of Saxony . " But now no one knows what to do with the money . We ca n't even draw up our own budgets . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upswing East does not adequately tackle , say its critics : There are simply not enough lawyers and administrators in eastern Germany who know the new rules . It does little good to give investors priority in cases of disputed property if there are not enough legal experts to trace the property through deed books . <p> Monthly bonuses for government employees who move to eastern Germany have been increased to 2,500 marks ( $1,460 ) a month . Workers have been promised promotions when they return . But poor housing , foul air , and substandard schools keep experienced administrators away . <p> " People are applying to go , but they 're not the qualified ones , " says Wolfgang Roth , economics expert for the opposition Social Democrats in the Bundestag . The government should make a tour of duty in eastern Germany obligatory , he says . <p> The Upswing East program is inadequate in other ways , say critics . It does not clearly remove the risk to new investors of having to pay for cleaning up soil contaminated by former east German manufacturers . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German industry , has been given the added job of trying to rehabilitate some of the concerns to stem job losses . <p> " The Treuhand 's only job should be sell , sell , sell , " says Kolle . It should not get bogged down in reorganizing and streamlining concerns . <p> The decision to steer the Treuhand in this direction obviously came from the rapid increase in unemployment , which is turning out to be socially unacceptable in the east . Kolle says that the pressure from demonstrators could cause Kohl to stray from his free-market principles and follow a make-job philosophy that will " only prolong the agony " of developing a free market . <p> Bonn is , in fact , already moving in this direction with DM 7 billion earmarked for job creation programs , especially relating to infrastructure .
