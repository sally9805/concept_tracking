PART 1 UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITES February , 195O He was not allowed to attend the hearing . There was his age , for one thing , but he knew it was really the reporters . From his bedroom window he could see them every morning when his father left the house . Mr. Benjamin , his lawyer , would come for him  --  it was somehow unthinkable that he should make the short walk down 2nd Street to the Capitol alone  --  and the minute they were down the steps Nick would see the clusters of hats swooping toward them like birds . There was even a kind of ritual about it now . No one stood in front of the house . Usually they were across the street , or on the corner , drinking coffee from paper cups , exhaling little puffs of steam in the cold February air . Then the front door would open and they would stamp out their cigarettes , suddenly on duty , and surround his father , falling into step with him and Mr. Benjamin as if they were joining them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographers , their hats pushed back on their heads as they popped flashbulbs , but now there were just the reporters . No one yelled or pushed . The ritual had turned polite . He could see his father in his long herringbone coat drawing the pack with him as he moved down the street , Mr. Benjamin , terrier-like , hurrying to keep up . His father never ignored the reporters . Nick could see him talking  --  but what did he say ?  --  and nodding his head . Once Nick saw one of them laugh . His father had said the whole thing was a goddam circus , but from up here in the window , watching the hats , it seemed friendly , a gang of boys heading for school . It was n't , though . At night , alone in the study , smoking in the light of the desk lamp , his father looked worried . His mother always left separately . She would busy herself with Nora , arranging the day , then stand in front of the hall mirror , touching her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette burned in the ashtray on the table where they put the mail . When Nick came downstairs she would look up surprised , as if she had forgotten he was in the house , then nervously pick up her lipstick to get ready . Her new dress , with its tight cinched waist and fitted top , seemed designed to hold her upright , every piece of her in place . " Have they gone ? " she said , putting on the lipstick . " Uh-huh . Dad made one of them laugh . " Her hand stopped for a minute , then the red tube continued along her lip . " Did he , " she said , blotting her lips , but it was n't a question . " Well , I 'll give them another five minutes . " " They never wait for you , you know , " Nick said . It was one of the things that puzzled him . His mother walked to the hearings alone every day , not even a single straggler from the pack of hats waiting behind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " They will one day , " she said , picking up her hat . " Right now all they can think about is your father . And his jokes . " She caught the edge herself and glanced at him , embarrassed , then went back to the hat . " There was only one , " Nick said . " I know , " she said quietly . " I did n't mean  --  check the window again , would you ? And should n't you be getting ready for school ? " " I am ready , " he said , going over to the window . " I do n't see why I ca n't go to the trial . " " Not again , Nicky , please . And it 's not a trial . For the hundredth time . It 's a hearing . That 's all . A congressional hearing . " " What 's the difference ? " " Your father 's not a criminal , that 's the difference . He 's not on trial for anything . " " Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? Has anyone said anything to you at school ? " Nick shrugged . " Have they ? " " They said he 's on trial for being a Communist . " His mother stopped fixing the hat and lowered her hands . " Well , he 's not on trial and he 's not a Communist . So much for what they now . Just do n't listen , okay ? It only makes it worse . They 're looking for Communists , so they have to talk to a lot of people in the government , that 's all . " Nick came back to the mirror , looking at them both , as if the world reflected would be his mother 's cheerful dream of before , when all they had to worry about was school gossip . " They want to hear what he has to say . That 's why it 's called a hearing . There , " she said , pressing the hat like a protective shell , " how do I look ? " Nick smiled . " Beautiful . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly , glancing at the mirror again and leaning forward . Nick loved to watch her dress , disappearing to the edge of her careful absorption . It was the harmless vanity of a pretty girl who 'd been taught that how you looked mattered , that appearance could somehow determine events . She blotted her lips one last time , then noticed his expression . " Honeybun , what 's wrong ? " " Why ca n't I hear him too ? I 'm not a little kid anymore . " " No , " she said softly , touching the side of his head . " Maybe just to me . But ten is n't very old either , is it ? You do n't want to grow up too fast . " " Is he going to go to Jail ? " She knelt down to face him , holding his shoulders . " No . Look , I know all of this seems confusing . But it 's not about you , do you understand ? Just  --  grownups . Your dad 's fine . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you ? It 's  --  it 's a bad time , that 's all . " A bad time . Nora , for whom Ireland was always just a memory away , called it troubles . " Before your father 's troubles started , " she would say , as if everything that was happening to them was beyond their control , like the weather . But no one would tell him what it actually was . " You go , " he said stubbornly . " It 's different for me . You 're just a child  --  it has nothing to do with you . It 's not going to either . I 'm not going to let that happen , " she said , holding his shoulders tightly . " Do you understand ? " He did n't , but he nodded , surprised at the force of her hands . " You 'll be late , " Nora said , coming into the hall . His mother looked up , distracted . " Yes , all right . Come on , honeybun , time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . This wo n't last much longer , I promise . Then we 'll go up to the cabin and forget all about it . Just us . Would you like that ? " Nick nodded . " You mean out of school ? " " Well , in the spring . " " Do n't forget you 've got Father Tim coming over later , " Nora said . " You 'll want to be back in time . Last time he was halfway through the bottle before you were through the door . " " Nora , " his mother said , pretending to scold but laughing in spite of herself . " Listen to you . He 's not a drinker . " " No , the poor are drinkers . The rich just do n't mind if they do . " " He 's not rich anymore . He 's a priest , for heaven 's sake , " she said , putting on her coat . " The rich do n't change . Someone else 's bottle , that 's what they like . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your bottle and if you do n't mind I 'm sure I  --  " " Nora , stop babbling . I 'll be back . Coast clear ? " She nodded her head toward the window . " How about a kiss , then ? " She leaned down let Nick graze her cheek . " Oh , that 's better . I 'm ready for anything now . " At the door she put on her gloves . " You remember what I said , okay ? Do n't listen to the other kids if they start saying things . They do n't know what they 're talking about anyway . " " It was n't the other kids . About Dad . It was Miss Smith . " " Oh . " His mother stopped , flustered , her shoulders sagging . " Oh , honeybun , " she said , and then , as if she had finally run out of answers , she turned and went out the door . After that , he did n't go to school . " At least for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal . Now , after his parents left , the house would grow still , so quiet that he would tiptoe , listening for the sharp whistle of Nora 's kettle in the kitchen , then the rustle of newspaper as she pored over his father 's troubles with one of her cups of tea . He was supposed to be reading Kidnapped . His mother said he was the right age for it , but after the wicked uncle and the broken stairs in the dark it all got confusing  --  Whigs and Jacobites , and you did n't know whose side you were supposed to be on . It made no more sense than the papers . His father was a New Dealer , but not a Communist , and not a Republican either , according to Nora . Then why was he on trial ? Some terrible woman had said he was a spy , but you only had to look at her , a11 made up the way she was , to know she was lying . And a Catholic too , which made things worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his father , even though she 'd hate to think how long it had been since he 'd seen the inside of a church . Still . And the things they said . But when Nick asked her to see the newspapers himself , she 'd refused . His mother would n't like it . So he sat in the deep club chair in the living room , pretending to read , but listening instead . While Nora had her tea there was no sound but the ticking of the ormolu clock . Soon , however , he 'd hear the scraping of a chair in the kitchen , then the heavy steps in the hall as Nora came to peek in before she began her chores . Nick would turn a page , his head bent to the book he was n't reading , until he felt her slip out of the doorway and head upstairs . After another few minutes , the vacuum would start with a roar and he could go . He would race down the back kitchen stairs , careful not to hit the creaky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread box , where Nora always hid it . Then , one ear still alert to the vacuum , he would read about the trial . KOTLAR DENIES ALLEGATIONS . COMMITTEE THREATENS CONTEMPT . MUNDT SET TO CALL ACHESON . NEW KOTLAR TESTIMONY . It always gave him an odd sensation to see his name in print . His eye would flash down the column , " Kotlar " leaping out as if it were in boldface , not just another word in a blur of type . But it was Kidnapped all over again . Whigs and Jacobites . The newspapers became part of the spy game . The point at first was to see how many rooms he could visit without Nora knowing  --  from the kitchen , up to his father 's study , then past the bedroom where she was working ( this was the best part ) to his mother 's dressing room , then back down the stairs ( carefully now , the vacuum having gone silent ) and into the club chair with the open book before she appeared again . Not that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just the game . Stuck in the house , cocooned against the cold outside that kept promising snow , he learned its secrets , the noisy parts , the bad floorboards , as if they were bits of Braille . He could even spy on Nora , watching through the crack in the door , crouching halfway down the stairs , until he felt he could roam the house at will , invisible . His father , he knew , could never have done this . You always knew where he was , clunking down the hall to the bathroom at night , all his weight on his heels . His mother said you could feel him a block away . It was Nick who knew how to spy . He could stand absolutely still , like one of those movie submarines with the motors off , on sonar silence , waiting to hear something . Then one day , by accident , he finally saw his father at the hearing . Nora had taken him downtown to the movies , a My Friend Irma picture with Martin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Year in Rome , long lines of pilgrims forming at the churches , some from Germany , some even from as far away as America . A crowded open-air mass . A year of new hope for a century half old . Fireworks exploded over St. Peter 's . Then , abruptly , the newsreel shifted to Washington , and the announcer 's voice turned grim . " A different kind of fireworks on Capitol Hill , as the House Committee on Un-American Activities and combative Congressman Kenneth Welles continued the probe into Communist subversion in our State Department . In the box again , Undersecretary Walter Kotlar , named by Soviet spy Rosemary Cochrane as one of the members of an alleged Washington ring . " He felt Nora move beside him and covered her hand to keep her still as the screen filled with his father walking down a corridor to the hearing room , wearing the familiar hat and herringbone coat . The reporters were more animated now , battering him with questions , as if they had finally thawed out from their morning vigil in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , several microphones in front of him , facing a long dais filled with men in suits who kept turning to whisper to aides who sat behind them like shadows , away from the lights . The man at the center , surprisingly young , was taller than the others , a thick football player 's neck bursting out of a suit that stretched across his wide shoulders like a padded uniform . " Mr. Kotlar , in 1945 you were a member of the American delegation that attended the Yalta Conference , were you not ? " " Yes . " " In that capacity did you offer views on the political future of the countries of Eastern Europe ? " " No . My views were not solicited . " " But you are Czechoslovakian , are you not ? " " No , sir , I am an American . " " Well , Mr. Kotlar , that 's fine . I meant by origin . Would you tell the committee where you were born ? " " I was born in what was then Bohemia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , but the carefulness of his answer had the odd effect of making him seem evasive . " I came to this country when I was four years old . " " But you speak Czechoslovakian ? " Nick 's father allowed the trace of a smile . " Czech ? No . " But this was n't true . Nick remembered his grandmother talking in her kitchen , his father nodding his head at the incomprehensible words . " I know a few words , " his father continued . " Certainly not enough to use the language in any official capacity . I know a little French , too . " This seemed to annoy the congressman . " This Committee is n't interested in your knowledge of French , Mr. Kotlar . Is it not true that as a member of the Yalta delegation , you had access to information the Russians considered very valuable ? " " No . I was there strictly as an advisor on Lend-Lease and postwar aid programs . My information was n't classified  --  it was available to everyone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class was being fresh . " That remains to be seen , Mr. Kotlar , " he said . " That remains to be seen . " He paused , pretending to consult a paper but really , Nick knew , just allowing his words to hang in the air . " Lend-Lease . We 've all heard about your generosity during the war . But after the war , you went right on being generous , did n't you ? Is n't it true you wanted to give Marshall Plan aid to Czechoslovakia ? " " The United States Government offered the Marshall Plan to all European countries . " " Maybe it would be more accurate to say that certain officials of the United States government offered that aid . Officials like yourself . Or maybe you disagreed . Did you feel that such an offer was in the best interests of the United States ? " " It must have been . They turned us down . " This time there was real laughter and Congressman Welles , leaning into the microphone , was forced to talk over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shouting . " May I remind our visitors that this is a congressional hearing ? " There were a few flashbulbs . " Mr. Kotlar , you may consider this a laughing matter . I assure you , the American people do not . Now this aid you were so eager to hand out . A little money for the old country  --  even if it was now a vassal state of the Soviet empire . " " I think you have your chronology slightly confused , congressman . At the time of the offer , Czechoslovakia was a democracy . And President Benes was eager to participate . Subsequently , of course , they declined . " Nick lost his father halfway through  --  it was Whigs and Jacobites again , too mixed up to sort out  --  and he could tell the audience was n't really following either . They could hear only the rhythm of Welles 's interrogation , the slow build and rising pitch that seemed to hammer his father into his chair . The momentum of it , not the words , became the accusation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It did n't really matter what he said , so long as the voice rushed along , gathering speed . " Round Two , " the voiceover said , introducing another film clip . " And this time nobody was pulling any punches . " " Mr. Kotlar , I 'm sure we 've all been grateful for the history lessons . Unfortunately , anyone who changes positions as often as you do is bound to make things a little confusing for the rest of us . So let 's see if we can find out what you really think . I 'd like to talk again about your background , if I may ? " He swerved his head to the other men at the long table , who nodded automatically , absorbed now in the drama of where he might be going . " You are , I believe , a graduate of the Harvard Law School ? " For a minute Nick 's father did n't respond , as if the question were so unexpected it must be a trick . " That 's correct . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did you join a firm or hang out your own shingle or what ? " " I came to Washington to work for the government . " " That would be , let 's see  --  1934 . Is that correct ? " " Yes . " " Of course , jobs were tight then , so I guess government work was pretty popular , " Welles said , suddenly folksy and reminiscent . " Kinda the patriotic thing to do in 1934 . Yes , sir , they used to say the Harvard Law School ran regular bus service down here right after graduation . " This play to the gallery had the expected effect , and Welles , smiling slyly , waited for the laughter to subside . Then he looked back at Nick 's father . " But you did n't come right away , did you ? " Nick 's father looked at him blankly , saying nothing . " Mr. Kotlar , is it not a fact that after Harvard Law School you offered your services to the United Mine Workers Union during their illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Just answer the question , " Welles shot back . " Did you work for the UMW ? " " Yes . " " And how much were you paid for this work ? " " It was unpaid . " " Unpaid . Free , you mean . Well , now , I 'm just a country lawyer  --  I did n't go to the Harvard Law School . They usually work for free up there ? Or just the labor agitators ? " He rushed on , not waiting for Nick 's father to reply . " The party often ask you to do union work , Mr. Kotlar ? " " No , " his father said quietly . " No . " He paused . " They had other plans for you . Washington plans . Seems a shame , considering . The strike went pretty well from their point of view , would n't you say ? " " I would n't know . I was n't working for the Communist Party . " " No . Just the miners . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special , I wonder . To work free of charge . " Nick 's father waited , drawing the room to his side of the table , then let his lips form the hint of a smile . " My father was a coal miner . He asked me to help . I did n't think I could refuse . " There was a slight pause and then the room buzzed . Welles , visibly surprised and annoyed , covered the microphone with his hand and turned to an aide . The other members of the committee began to talk too , as if by looking away Welles had given them all a brief recess . When he turned back to the mike , the room grew still , expectant . " I 'm sure the committee all appreciate a son 's devotion , Mr. Kotlar , " he said , reaching again for sarcasm . But the momentum had gone . Nick was n't sure what had happened , but his father was sitting up straighter , no longer letting his shoulders hunch in self-protection . " Perhaps they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal services in that strike . It says here that the picket line at the Trousdale Colliery got pretty violent . You were arrested , were you not ? " " No . There was a scuffle with the company guards , that 's all . No arrests . " " Mr. Kotlar , we 're not talking about a speeding ticket here . Do you deny there was a violent incident in which you took part ? " " I do n't deny there was a fight . I deny I took part in it . " " Oh ? What were you doing ? " " I was trying to stay out of the way . " Now there was real laughter , a wave that passed through the room , gathering force until it spilled onto Welles 's table , breaking as it hit his angry face . " Mr. Kotlar , " he said loudly , " I think I 've had enough . I 've had enough impertinence . This committee is charged with the serious business  --  the very serious business  --  of investigating Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Harvard Law School evasions . And I think the American people have had enough of high-handed boys who use their tax dollars while they sell this country down the river . You go ahead and laugh . But that was no scuffle , and you are no loyal American . When I look at your testimony , start to finish , I see nothing less than an attempt to deceive this committee and this great country . Well , we 're not going to be deceived . This committee is here to look at un-American activities . In your case , I think the people of this country are going to be grateful we did . " " Congressman , " Nick 's father said , his voice tight with scorn . " The only un-American activity I 've seen is taking place right here in this committee room . I hope the people see that too . " Another clip , the announcer 's voice more excited now . " But the sparring match drew to a close as Congressman Welles zeroed in on the sensational Cochrane testimony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father was wearing a different suit , the gray double-breasted one Nick 's mother said made him look heavier . " Mr. Kotlar , Rosemary Cochrane testified that on several occasions she received government documents from you in her role as a courier for a Russian undercover operation . " The congressman paused . " Do you recall that testimony ? " " Vividly . " " And you denied these charges . In fact , you denied ever having met her , is that correct ? " " To the best of my knowledge , I have never met her . " " To the best of your knowledge ? " " I was trying to be precise . I may have encountered her without my knowing it . Certainly I have no memory of having done so . " " Is that your way of saying no ? " Welles said . " Do I have to remind you that you 're under oath ? " His father managed a wry smile . " No , you do n't have to remind me . " " Mr. Kotlar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " For a moment , Nick 's father looked blank . " I 'm sorry . What ? " " Have you ever shopped at Garfinkel 's department store ? The big store down on 14th Street . You 're familiar with Garfinkel 's ? " " Yes . I suppose so . " " Shirts ? Ever buy shirts there ? " " I do n't remember . " " You do n't remember . Now how could that be ? " " My wife usually does the shopping . " The camera moved to take in Nick 's mother , sitting rigidly at the edge of the row behind , her eyes blinking in the unfamiliar light . Nick felt Nora squirm beside him . " That 's it , " she whispered urgently . " We 're going . " " No , when it 's over , " Nick said firmly , not moving , his head . " I want to see . " Congressman Welles was talking again . " But I suppose once in a while you find time in your busy schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And you never bought shirts from Miss Cochrane ? " " Was she the salesgirl ? I do n't remember . " " She remembers you , Mr. Kotlar . She remembers receiving envelopes from you during these little shopping trips . Does that refresh your memory ? " " She is mistaken . " " She even remembers your size . Fifteen and a half , thirty-three . Can you at least remember that for the Committee ? That your size ? " His father smiled . " I prefer a 35 , " he said . " A longer sleeve . " " A longer sleeve , " Welles repeated sarcastically . " Maybe you 're still growing . You 'd better watch your nose then . They say it gets longer every time you tell a lie . " " I 'm watching yours , too , congressman . " More laughter , and this time Nick got the joke . He remembered Pinocchio , the sick feeling in his stomach when the boy went to Donkey Island and could n't get back . He felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him was having a good time . But his father did n't look scared  --  his smooth , lean face was calm , as if he knew it was all just a movie . And so this week 's round ends in a draw , " the announcer was saying , " as both sides retire to their corners to come back to fight another day . " But it was n't a boxing match , it was a trial , and Welles was the only fighter who came back in the last clip , surrounded by hand-held microphones on the windy Capitol steps . " I do n't think there can be a doubt in anyone 's mind that this country is under attack , " he said , his face grave , looking straight at the camera . " These people are using lies and tricks the same way their comrades overseas are using tanks and machine guns to undermine the free world . We saw it in the Hiss case and we 're seeing it again here . Walter Kotlar is a Communist and he 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it is . " And then all at once the screen brightened , flooded with Florida sun as the newsreel switched to water-skiing formations in Cypress Gardens . Nick blinked in the light . A man and woman in bathing suits were receiving crowns . After a rooster crowed to end the newsreel , the screen went dark . Nick watched the curtain close , then open again to start the feature , but he was no longer paying attention to any of it . Nora laughed at some of the movie , but Nick was thinking about the newsreel and missed the point of the joke and then have to pretend to laugh when everyone else did . He could still see Welles 's wide linebacker 's face , eyes peering out as if he thought he could make you squirm just by looking hard enough . He was like one of those guys who kept poking you in the chest until you had to fight . But every time Nick 's father hit back , he 'd get madder . He 'd never stop now . The newsreel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened since . After the movie , on the street , Nora was uneasy . " Do n't tell your mother . She would n't like it . " " I wo n't . " " He 's a wicked man , the senator . " " He 's not a senator . " " Well , whatever he is . " She sighed , then brightened . " Still , I 'll say this for your father . He gave as good as he got . "
