txt // scale by Johann Glauber ; and Nicholas Lemery wrote Cours de chymie , a clear , concise chemistry textbook , and he made a living from chemical lectures and sales of his text . We choose Johannes van Helmont as our 1600s chemical exemplar because he also exemplifies the age : He is at times impressively progressive , at other times depressingly archaic . Johannes van Helmont Johannes ( Joan ) Baptista van Helmont , born in Brussels in the late 1500s to a family of landed gentry , had difficulty finding an intellectual home . Initially he studied arts , but believing academic degrees a vanity , he took no degree in this course of study . He studied under mystics as well as Jesuits , and he studied the classics as well as contemporary authors . He studied medicine , but after a time gave away his books to other students , saying later he should have burned them . // In the manner of Paracelsus , Helmont then turned to travel as a means of acquiring medical knowledge . By the turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicality , because he had acquired a medical degree and begun practicing medicine . He had some success as a physician , and he was apparently able to offer some relief during a 1605 epidemic of the plague . He must have found medicine in the trenches disturbing because he soon declared " I refuse to live on the misery of my fellow men " or " to accumulate riches and endanger my soul , " 3 and he turned instead to private research . By Helmont 's time the word chemist had come to mean someone who prepared medicines , extracts , and salts , and the word alchemist , now almost synonymous with swindle , was starting to fall out of use . Helmont , lacking a name to describe a person doing chemical research , called himself a philosopbus per ignem , a philosopher of fire . ' He was affluent enough to have retired when he became ( through marriage ) a manorial lord . " God has given me a pious and noble wife . I retired with her ... and for seven years I dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . " 5 He and his wife had an unspecified number of daughters and one son , Franciscus Mercurius , a name that celebrated his father 's devotion to the chemical arts . When considering Helmont 's medical theory , we must remember that in the 1600s medicine was in as much a state of flux as was chemistry . Medicine had long been a matter of tradition and superstition . And though Paracelsus had demonstrated that new remedies might occasionally be found in chemical preparations ( at least mercury worked against syphilis ) , medicine was far from using strict empirical methods . So while Helmont progressively questioned the therapeutic effects of sweating and bleeding , he used the specific gravity of urine as a diagnostic tool , and came close to identifying stomach acid as hydrochloric acid , he regressively put faith in such foul remedies as worms from the eyes of toads . Helmont was living in Belgium , a Spanish possession , at the time of the Spanish Inquisition , and when an article written by Helmont was published ( probably without his permission ) defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the treatment the wound itself was only cleaned and bound , while the weapon that caused it was taken away and treated with medicinal ointments and // salves . Ironically the technique may have had a higher cure rate than conventional treatments that applied noxious chemicals or dirty herbal preparations to the wound . The Inquisitors however were not amused by such magical methods when practiced by the laity . Helmont was condemned for heresy , arrogance , and association with Lutheran and Calvinist groups . Helmont prudently acknowledged his error and revoked his " scandalous pronouncements , " but he was still arrested , and after several interrogations , he was placed under house arrest . The house arrest was lifted after 2 years , but church proceedings against him were not formally ended until 8 years later , 2 years before his death . Helmont 's chemical theory was also a curious blend of the archaic and the advanced . Many of his day accepted the dissolution of metals in acid as evidence of transmutation , and transmutation was also used to explain the reaction ( called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a stream naturally rich in copper salts eventually becomes coated with a copper layer . Helmont was able to discern the difference and denied that either of these reactions was transmutation , but this did not stop him from believing in the possibility . He gave an account of what he sincerely believed to be a transmutation of 8 ounces of mercury into gold achieved by a quarter of a grain of a yellow powder given to him by a stranger . It is hard to know what actually happened . Mercury is well known for its combining powers , and it very well may have incorporated some yellow colored material and become a yellow-colored solid ( this was how false gold was made by artisans ) , but it is difficult to conceive of a material that could do so in such small amounts . It may have been that the scale Helmont used was wrong , or maybe the person who gave him the powder also gave him a vessel to use with it , and something in the vessel entered into the reaction . The charlatan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pulling off such a deception . So Helmont continued to vacillate from revolutionary to reactionary throughout his life . He rejected the Aristotelian four elements ( at great personal risk , it should be noted ) , but then replaced them with water and air , pointing to the biblical story of the creation of the heavens and water on the first and second days . On the other hand he made extensive use of the balance , and as a result of his careful ca. 1600 : Philosophers of Fire 1 observation , he was convinced that nothing is created or destroyed in a chemical reaction . In his famous willow tree experiment ( actually suggested 200 years before ) , he weighed a willow seedling , then planted it in a tub with 200 pounds- of soil . After watering it for 5 years , he removed the tree and reweighed it and the soil . He found that the tree had increased in weight but the soil weighed the same . He therefore concluded that the tree had converted the water into wood . The experiment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also been weighed , but that would have been difficult because of spillage , leakage , and evaporation . Also the plant 's intake of carbon dioxide and output of oxygen were ignored because Helmont had no idea this was occurring . But the basic idea was there : Matter had to be accounted for in the balance . Whatever was put into a reaction should come out in one form or another . Such ideas were not unique to Helmont . His German contemporary , Angelus Sala , dissolved a weighed amount of copper in sulfuric acid , chemically recovered the metallic copper , and found that it weighed the same as the copper he began with . Sala was also able to show that he could artificially produce a hydrated copper sulfate identical to a naturally occurring substance , a revolutionary thought for the time . But Sala did not have the prestige and influence of Helmont , so his work ? though remarkable for the time ? did not have the impact that Helmont 's had . Not all of Helmont 's impact however had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his description of a whole new class of substances : gas . Helmont coined the word gas , probably based on chaos , and though most of the gas he produced was carbon dioxide ( obtained by burning charcoal , fermenting grapes , or the action of acids on carbonate salts ) , he also obtained impure samples of nitrogen oxides ( from the action of nitric acid on metals ) ; sulfur dioxide ( from burning sulfur ) ; chlorine and nitrosyl chloride ( from the reaction of nitric acid with ammonium chloride ) ; and a mixture of hydrogen , methane , and carbon monoxide ( from the dry distillation of organic material and from intestinal gas , which he also knew to be flammable ) . He called this gas phase spiritus sylvestris ( wild spirit ) because he believed it could not be restrained to a vessel or reduced to a visible state . When chemists began to tame this wild spirit ? gas ? // and apply their results to an unexplained problem ? combustionmuch needed new theories slowly emerged . CA. 1600 : CHAOS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subject worthy of study , gases could not immediately be attacked experimentally because of technical problems . The first of these was containment . Helmont did not always appreciate the volume of gas that would be released in his reactions , so he routinely burst the crude and delicate glassware of the day . In fact he believed gases could not be contained , and he left the matter there . However a Benedictine monk , Dom Perignon , showed that effervescence in his newly invented beverage , champagne , could be trapped in glass bottles with bits of the bark of a special oak tree . The resultant cork was a triumph for celebrants and chemists alike . Another worker , Jean Bernoulli , used a burning glass ( a lens used to focus the sun ? soon to be standard equipment in the chemist 's repertoire ) to ignite gunpowder in a flask . To avoid repeating the shattering experience of Helmont , Bernoulli did his work in an open , rather than a sealed , system , running a tube from the ignition flask to a vat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner that gases from the reaction occupied a much larger volume that the gunpowder ( and became wet in the process ) . Otto von Guericke designed a practical air pump in the mid-1600s , and armed with this and new techniques for containment ? corks and Bernoulli 's vat ? a group of young scientists took on the task of determining the qualities of Helmont 's gases . Working primarily in Oxford , England , they were called , appropriately enough , the Oxford Chemists : Boyle , Hooke , and Mayow . Robert Boyle Robert Boyle was born to a noble family of vacillating fortunes . His father had gone to colonize southwestern Ireland in the 1500s and had become rich and influential . He lost his property in a rebellion ca. 1600 Philosophers of Fire 115 however and returned to England only to be thrown into prison for misusing his position in Ireland and funds entrusted to him . Eventually acquitted ( and financially recovered ) , the elder Boyle bought Sir Walter Raleigh 's estates in Ireland . He again accumulated wealth through influence and industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boyle was his fourteenth child . Boyle 's family background is important because his inherited wealth allowed him the freedom and finances to pursue his chemical investigations . He had as fine an education as could be acquired at the time . He was taught at home by private tutors , then at Eton , a dis tinguished public school . Under the auspices of an older brother , Boyle traveled in Europe and was tutored in the liberal arts and practical mathematics . In the course of his travels , Boyle made a trip to Italy to // be introduced firsthand to the work of the recently deceased Galileo . He became an enthusiastic proponent of the new science . With the outbreak of civil war in England , Boyle 's father , a Royalist , again suffered a setback in fortune and soon died . The young Boyle returned home to live simply and modestly in the family home . He did not take a strong interest in politics ( probably wise considering the family history and the current atmosphere ) , and after 10 years ( around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Boyle moved to Oxford . There he performed experiments for a time in lodgings next to University College , and he took part in a discussion group called the Invisible College . A lifelong bachelor , Boyle was of rather frail health , though we wonder how much of his health would have been spared if he had not had an interest in chemistry . Boyle , like many other early chemists , reported taste among the properties of many reagents , and he was fond of dosing himself and friends with various preparations . Partially because of his bad health , he eventually moved to London to live with his sister . Boyle set up a modest laboratory at the back of her house , which became a meeting place for science-oriented intellectuals and a center for research . Boyle was a prodigious worker , and he performed experiments on many chemical systems , but his experiments on the nature of Helmont 's gases are of crucial interest here . When Boyle learned of Guericke 's air pump , he immediately began investigation . The income left by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistants . One of these , Robert Hooke ? an important investigator in his own right ? built an air pump . Boyle attached it to the perennial chemist 's glass bulb and began experimenting . Within a matter of a few years , he had enough results to compile a book , New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall , Touching the Spring of the Air and Its Effects . This was Boyle 's first scientific publication and the one that established his fame . In it he reported that sound did not propagate in a vacuum and that air was truly necessary for life and flame . In the appendix of the second edition ( issued only a few years later ) , he elaborated on his observation of the elasticity of air , noting that the volume occupied by air was inversely proportional to the pressure applied // ( squeezing on a balloon makes it smaller ) . This generalization became known as Boyle 's law , although in France , it is referred to as Mariotte 's law because Edme Mariotte also described it , albeit later than Boyle . Mariotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originality either , treating it instead as one of several well-known laws of air . Boyle explained the elasticity of air by assuming that air consisted of corpuscles defined in the manner of Rene Descartes and that " each corpuscle endeavors to beat off all others from coming within the little sphere requisite to its motion about its own center . " ' Though lacking the mathematical treatment necessary for its full elucidation , this notion anticipated the currently accepted theory of the behavior of gases ? the kinetic theory of gases ? which is based on the motion of their constituent particles . Boyle and his contemporaries considered air to be one substance , attributing differences in reactivity to differences in purity . For instance they saw that air generated by dropping steel filings into acid ignited when lit with a candle , whereas room air did not . Actually they were lucky that this was all they saw : The gas they were generating was hydrogen , and hydrogen mixed with oxygen can ignite with an explosion . Boyle also investigated the common observation that metals , when calcined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know now that metals heated this way gain weight because they combine with the oxygen in the air . If this process is carried out in a sealed container , the weight of the system as a whole ? the metal , the air , and the container ? should remain the same . Boyle heated metals in a sealed retort , but when he weighed it , he failed to account for the inrush of air that occurred when he opened the heated vessel . Boyle reported an increase in the weight of the whole system and therefore concluded that the increase was due to fire passing through the pores of the glass . When it was suggested to Boyle that he should have weighed the retort before breaking the seal , Boyle reported that he had but obtained the same final weight ! It was probably a faulty vacuum seal rather than a preconception on Boyle 's part that caused him to report this false result . Boyle , more than many thinkers of his age ( and indeed more than many thinkers of our own age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He understood the importance of strict experimental // procedure . Rationalists , such as Leibniz , doubted the value of investigation by experiment because they believed they could arrive at truth by logical reasoning and that experiment was good only for confirmation . But Boyle conducted long disputes with rationalists , defending experiment as a means of proof . The systematic Boyle also found rankling the imprecise language of chemical theorists of his day . To call the attention of his colleagues to these inconsistencies , he wrote in 1661 the classic didactic dialog The Sceptical Chymist . In it Boyle used the familiar device of a conversation among a group of friends ? Themistus ( defender of the Aristotelian theory of four elements ) , Philoponus ( defender of the Paracelsian theory of three ) , Eleutherius ( an uncommitted participant ) , the recorder of the conversations ( whose name is not disclosed ) , and Carneades ( the skeptical chemist ) ? to attack both the Aristotelian and Paracelsian systems . In the 1600s the concept of an element was essentially the same as the Aristotelean concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus if sulfur were considered an element , then sulfur must be found in everything from gold to grape juice . Boyle was not happy with this concept of an element , but he did not really offer anything in its place , though the following quotation from The Sceptical Chymist is sometimes given as evidence that he did : And to prevent mistakes , I must advertize you , that I now mean by Elements ... certain Primitive and Simple , or perfectly unmingled bodies ... of which all those called perfectly mixed Bodies are immediately compounded , and into which they are ultimately resolved . " But this definition is compatible with what chemists of the 1600s viewed as elements as well as the modern view , so it is doubtful that Boyle meant anything new . He likewise offered no new list of what should be considered an element , but this may be to his credit . Boyle knew the definitions were faulty , but he did not feel on firm enough experimental ground to offer an alternative . He did however hypothesize that there could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five . He would have been interested to know that today we list 109 , and we are looking for more . // Boyle 's contributions to chemistry , beyond his work on gases , are substantial . They include systematic studies of reactions between acids and bases ; some of the earliest application of plant-derived acid and base indicators ; and duplicating the process of isolating phosphorus . In The Skeptical Chymist Boyle seems to question transmutation , but he never really abandoned a belief in alchemy . When he died , he left Newton a sample of a red earth that he believed would turn mercury into gold . However this incongruous end was in an incongruous age . One group guarded new discoveries as alchemical secrets , while another group quarreled over who had announced new discoveries first . One of the foremost members of this latter group was the former assistant to Boyle : Robert Hooke . Robert Hooke Robert Hooke was by all accounts ill-natured , but he lived with such constant discomfort , real and imagined , that he could not have been otherwise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a skeletal defect that gave him a twisted frame and such poor health that he was not expected to survive infancy . Survive he did , but he continually suffered from headaches and other maladies , perhaps compounding his condition with hypochondria . His family attempted to educate him for the ministry , but he was not diligent in this study . On seeing a clock dismantled however , he built his own out of wood , then proceeded to construct his own mechanical toys . When his father died , the family , believing that he had some talent in art , gave him 100 pounds and sent him to London to buy an apprenticeship to a painter . On arrival in London however , Hooke reneged on the apprenticeship , pocketed the money , and somehow managed to be admitted by the master of Westminster School . There Hooke learned Latin , Greek , and mathematics , reading ( by his own account ) the first six books of Euclid in a week . With this background Hooke hired out as an assistant to physicians . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to Boyle at Oxford . At about this same time however , with the fall of Cromwell and the restoration of the Stuarts , many in the Invisible College circle of students and teachers were dismissed // due to their political leanings . A few moved to London , where they reorganized and ? after a couple of years ? accepted the king 's patronage and became the Royal Society . The Royal Society continues to be important in the history of chemistry as a forum for discussion and a vehicle for publication . It is still very important , and membership in this organization , which is by election , is considered England 's highest scientific accolade . Philosophical Transactions , an instrument of the Royal Society and the world 's oldest currently continuing scientific journal , was founded in 1665 . Part of the initial success of the Society lay in the fact that it hired Hooke to be the curator of experiments . In the rarefied intellectual atmosphere of London , Hooke began his independent career of many astoundingly diversified achievements . He enunciated the relationship known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elastic body , such as a spring , is proportional to the force applied . This law was later used to describe the motion of atomic nuclei in molecules . Hooke used a telescope to make several original astronomical observations and a microscope to describe snowflakes , cells ( a word he first used ) , and microscopic fossils . Hooke speculated on using the barometer to predict weather , but he later doubted its efficacy , confounded no doubt by variables that weather forecasters still struggle with today . Appointed surveyor of London after the Great Fire , Hooke amassed a considerable sum of money , and with this and his new , respected position , he should have been a contented man . But in Hooke 's diary we see a lonely person in pain . He never married but had a succession of mistresses , some of whom took monetary advantage of him . His poor health now included a chronic and painful sinus inflammation accompanied by headaches , vomiting , giddiness , sleeplessness , indigestion ( possibly worms ) , and nightmares . These various maladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare night passed peacefully , he noted it in his dairy as " Slept well . Deo Gratias . " ' Hooke was chronically embroiled in various controversies in which he felt that his ideas had been usurped without proper credit . As with most things of this sort , there was probably some basis for his feelings . It has been reported that Newton , due to disagreements with // Hooke , refused to acknowledge Hooke 's contributions to the study of light and delayed the publication of Opticks for two decades after Hooke 's death . ' ? When the one true love of his life , Grace , his niece , ward , and later mistress , died , Hooke became even more reclusive and cynical . His illnesses and discomforts must have increased because it was said that in his last 2 years , he neither undressed nor went to bed . But despite whatever flaws of personality , it should be noted that when he died at 68 , the entire membership of the Royal Society attended his funeral to mourn his passing . Hooke contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work with Boyle , he pointed to some directions for future chemical research . In his book describing his observations with a microscope , Micrographia , Hooke put forth a theory of combustion in which he states that a substance common to both potassium nitrate and air , nitrous air , is the agent of combustion . But as with many of his insights , he did not pursue the idea further ( a habit that was the source perhaps , of his perception that others usurped his ideas ) , leaving this to the next person we encounter , John Mayow . THE QUESTION OF COMBUSTION We might have expected Boyle 's observations on the physical properties of the gas phase to excite a flurry of experimental activity in this direction , but the opposite occurred . Boyle 's results seemed to show that all gases behaved alike , so there seemed to be no need for further research . Boyle himself realized there was more to be discovered , as he stated in the late 1670s in Suspicions about the Hidden Realities of the Air . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air had something to do with combustion . To the delight of children and the despair of insurance agencies , combustion , though commonplace , still remains one of the most spectacular and fascinating chemical reactions . Aristotle believed fire to be one of the four constituents of matter , and he reasoned that during combustion , this element was released . Paracelsus reasoned that all that burned contained sulfur ; therefore he considered this substance // to be an element and a component of all compound things . The function of air in supporting combustion was seen by the alchemists as vaguely mechanical : a means by which heat and fire were carried off . All these speculations sounded reasonable enough , and they could be envisioned without too much imagination . The only problem was that tin smiths and lead smiths kept pointing out with irritating regularity that the materials they worked with gained weight when heated , which should not have been occurred if the element of fire were released . But this observation did not cause the four-element theory immediate , insurrmountable problems . For one reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not become a central part of chemists ' thinking until the late part of the next century , although it was hinted at in the work of Helmont and Angelus Sala . When it was observed that metals heated to a high temperature in air ( a process called calcination ) gained weight , some imagined ? as did Cardanus in the mid-1550s ? that the element of fire was somehow working against gravity , buoying the metal up while it was still part of it . Others , such as Boyle , attributed the weight gain to the absorption of some part of the heat or light or flame . A few , such as John Mayow and a certain Jean Rey , found a more plausible explanation ? and one that won out in the end . John Mayow John Mayow was born to an old , established , and respected Cornish family . Though a practicing physician , he dedicated much of his personal time to scientific research , and he was an intimate of the Oxford group and eventually a Fellow of the Royal Society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important advances in gas-handling techniques : He showed that gas could be transferred from one vessel to another underwater and that volumes of gas could be directly compared if they were at the same pressure . He achieved this equalization of pressure by leveling the water inside and outside a gas-containing vessel with a siphon . Mayow also did some interesting , and ( some say ) precocious work on the theory of combustion . The level of understanding about this important reaction is summarized in Boyle 's researches on the subject . Boyle knew that air was // involved in combustion because if he dropped a combustible material on a red-hot plate under vacuum , nothing happened . If he admitted air , the material burst into flame . Mayow refined this observation by conducting a series of experiments in which he showed that only part of the air was used in combustion and respiration . He inverted a glass vessel over a candle or an animal perched on a pedestal in a tub of water , equalized the water levels inside and outside the glass vessel by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candle burned or the rodent breathed . Because part of the air was still left when the candle or rodent extinguished , he knew that this second type of air could not support combustion or respiration . He named the first part of the air , the part that supported combustion , nitro-aerial . Mayow then made a leap in imagination to conclude that weight gained by metals during calcination was due to absorption of nitroaerial particles . Mayow came enticingly close to anticipating by a hundred years the oxygen theory of Lavoisier . But before too much is read into his insight , we must note that in a style reminiscent of the alchemists , he overinterpreted his result and began seeing nitro-aerial particles everywhere : Rays of sun were nitro-aerial particles ; iron , because it sparked when struck , contained nitro-aerial particles . And Mayow was not the only one to come up with such a notion . Though not so well developed , the idea was earlier expressed by Jean Rey , a French physician , who explained why lead and tin gained weight on heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ... mixes with the calx ... and becomes attached to its most minute particles ... " " However he did little experimental work . He did point out ( with his own leap of intuition and in anticipation of the law of definite proportions ) that the increase in weight never exceeds a certain amount : " Nature in her inscrutable wisdom has set limits which she never oversteps . " ' Z Unfortunately Mayow was confounded by another law of nature : An idea is not recognized until its time has come . The delay in the development of an accurate theory of combustion however can not be blamed entirely on timing . Some credit has to go to the rivalry of another theory of combustion that was being developed at the time . It , too , had a very logical derivation and in addition a catchy name phlogiston ( 65-jis ' - ten ) . Phlogiston was supposed // to be a material that leaves a substance undergoing combustion . Although little more than a rehash of Aristotle 's fire element , this time the theory was supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorrect ? some say it was a roadblock in the development of chemistry ? the debate it inspired was eventually the basis for an new age in chemistry . The story starts with an interesting entrepreneur , promoter , and ( some say ) opportunist : John Joachim Becher . John Joachim Becher Becher , whose work included a book , Foolish Wisdom and Wise Folly ( in which he described a stone that turned people invisible and a flask that could hold words ) and the invention ( on commission ) of a universal language for which he was never paid , was in most ways a complete throwback to the European middle ages . But he was also in a way the herald of the new age . With the nonexperimental , head-scratching methods of the ancients , he set about trying to determine the basic elements of which all matter is composed , and with a blend of previous ideas rather than anything original , he came up with air , water , and three earths : the fusible , the fatty , and the fluid . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fatty , inflammable earth , which later became known as phlogiston . He also envisioned calcination as the same process : " Metals contain an inflammable principle which by the action of fire goes off into the air ; a metal calx is left . " " He knew that the metals gained weight in this process , but with perhaps the first of what would be a long stream of rationalizations in support of the phlogiston theory , he at times explained this as an incorporation of ponderable particles of fire and at other times as the power of levity of the phlogiston : " Something minus another thing that weighs less than nothing , weighs more . ' These ideas proposed by Becher were not fully developed by him ? or in the 1600s ? but more in the 1700s by our next subject , Georg Ernest Stahl . In fact Stahl should be placed chronologically in the next chapter . But standing as he does with one foot in this era and one in the next , Stahl makes an ideal conclusion to this equivocal age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teacher of chemistry and medicine , was born in the latter half of the century . Giving full credit to Becher for the idea , Stahl popularized the theory of a fatty earth that leaves a burning material , calling it phlogiston . However leaving Becher behind , Stahl supported the theory on experimental grounds . He reasoned thus : Sulfur burns in a flame and produces sulfuric acid ; therefore sulfur consists of sulfuric acid and phlogiston . If phlogiston were restored to sulfuric acid , the original sulfur would be recovered . Because charcoal reduces metal oxides to metals and when burned // leaves only a small amount of ash , charcoal must be rich in phlogiston . Therefore charcoal heated with sulfuric acid should restore the phlogiston and yield the original sulfur . And indeed when Stahl fixed sulfuric acid ( made it a solid by allowing it to react with potassium hydroxide ) , then heated it with charcoal , he obtained liver of sulfur ( a potassium polysulfide ) . This is the same dark brown amorphous mass obtained when pure sulfur is fused with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulfur back , and the phlogiston theory worked . Stahl 's explanations , based on experiment and couched in a simple , intuitively appealing form , were so seductive that the phlogiston theory remained viable for some 70 years . Many observations were explained by phlogiston : Metals heated in air changed because they lose phlogiston . When the resulting calxes ( oxides ) are heated with charcoal , they change back into the metal because they gain phlogiston from the charcoal . Combustion could not occur in a vacuum because air was needed to absorb phlogiston mechanically . Combustion in a sealed container ceased when the air became saturated with phlogiston . The primary difficulty however remained : Metal oxides lose weight when reduced to metals , and this was the weakness that led to the eventual downfall of the theory . But the information gained in the effort to prove or disprove the theory was the data base for the next theory ? and this one would stand . So although Europe in the 1600s had both medieval and modern aspects , progress in chemistry was made . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phlogiston theory with the conjecture-based theorizing of , say , Paracelsus . This new faith in experimental methods ? topped with the successes of the Scientific Revolution ? culminated in a new philosophy : Enlightenment . The essence of Enlightenment was a rejection of tradition for the sake of progress and an improvement of the human condition . Politically this meant individual freedom and equality . Scientifically this meant a critical application of scientific methods . Chemically this meant Aristotle had to go . The problem however was finding a replacement . chapter SEVEN ca. 1700 : The Search for System and Phlogiston C hemists of the 1700s were carried along with the spirit of the age : progress , Enlightenment , system . Unfortunately their initial attempt at system ? phlogiston ? was wrong , though it would make its own , upside-down , contribution : through the battles phlogiston inspired , the right system would eventually be found . // Though the century ended quite differently , in the beginning of the 1700s , the world found itself an unusual circumstance : a period of relative peace . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Ottoman Empire . In central Africa harbors of slave trade pockmarked the coast , but the interior remained out of reach of outside adventurers . In the New World inhabitants struggled to recover from 127 // the European invasion , and the invaders had not yet turned on each other . By the 1700s Japan had tossed out the Europeans ( with the exception of a few who were willing to defile the cross and promise not to preach ) , and it enjoyed the great peace of the Tokugawa shogunate . When the British tried to counter an unfavorable trade balance by selling Indian opium to China , Chinese leaders decided the Europeans were not only culturally inferior but also purveyors of drugs , so the Chinese erected barriers , mental and real , and settled behind them in a temporary peace . India of the 1700s found itself caught up in a dark age of religious fatalism , as Europeans had been a few hundred years before , and political shifts meant little to the average Hindu . With this apathy came a kind of peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lords and round table discussions , had been efficient enough for wars by knights with spears , but when faced with artilleries and large professional armies , a need for a more responsive system soon became apparent . The solution arrived at temporarily was to concentrate government power in nationalistic , absolute monarchies . Although the primary impetus for absolute monarchies was the ability to wage war more effectively , the actual consequence , at least at the opening of the 1700s , was a power standoff and a period of relative peace . So despite the chaos of the religious wars of the 1500s and the ambiguities of the 1600s , the 1700s emerged with a clear trend : a rejection of tradition and a new passion for progress . This Enlightenment ( as it was called ) found a curious partner in the absolute monarchies : The resultant philosophy of government came to be known as Enlightened Despotism . The ideal enlightened despot drained marshes , built roads , codified laws , repressed regionalism , curtailed the church , and administered everything through a professional bureaucracy . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient , and for many the standard of living improved . The result was that individual loyalties shifted from the village to the nation , and this new nationalism expressed itself in national rivalries when times were good . When times were bad , it meant a return to war . Because these rivalries and wars of the European nations in large part dictate the course of our chemical history , it behooves us at this point to take a // brief look at some of these players as they take their positions on the I H ) ard . THE ENLIGHTENED DESPOTS England England ( or the United Kingdom , after the union of England and Scotland in 1707 ) had survived a civil war , a Puritan commonwealth , and now had its monarchy restored . But the powers of the restored monarchy were curtailed , and a strong parliament controlled the army . The nation had a Bill of Rights guaranteeing habeas corpus , the right to petition , the right to bear arms , and the right to debate . It had an Act of Toleration granting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unitarians ) . It remained happily insulated by its still imposing channel of water , and it had little interest in continental political problems . Spain At the opening of the 1700s Spain suffered from one of the inherent ills of rule by a monarchical family : Its king was an impotent , imbecilic product of inbreeding in the Hapsburg family . When this king died in 1700 , the king of France and the Holy Roman Emperor ( each of whom had married one of the sisters of the King of Spain ) struggled for the throne . The inevitable war however had a new twist . Because union with Spain would make the winner too strong , none of the noncompeting countries wanted either contestant to win . To prevent this , they invoked a new tactic called the Balance of Power , under whose precepts alliances of convenience were made , broken , and reformed until the war ended with compromise . Spain lost some European possessions , retained its American ones , and gained a French king on the understanding that the same king could never occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reigned with few interruptions until the republican revolution of the 1900s. // Prussia Frederick William , at the age of 20 , succeeded as head of the house of Brandenburg and what was left of Prussia after the devastation of the Thirty Years ' War . With a large portion of his population lost by starvation , plague , or murder by marauding armies , he instituted , understandably , a military culture . The first Prussian king to appear always in uniform , he focused on the cultivation of his army . In fact he ruled his country as though it were one large army , disciplining citizens with his walking stick as though they were troops . During his reign Berlin grew to be a city of 100,000 inhabitants , one out of five of whom were soldiers . By 1740 under his son , Frederick the Great , Prussia had become a great power . This Frederick though was different from his father . He liked to play the flute , correspond with French poets , write prose and verse , and at 18 years of age tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was caught , brought back , and forced to watch the execution of a friend who had helped him run away . Though eventually a capable leader , he remained a freethinker like many of his age , rejecting religion and the divine right of monarchs . As he wrote to Voltaire , " My chief occupation is to fight ignorance and prejudices in this country . . . I must enlighten my people , cultivate their manners and morals , and make them as happy as human beings can be .... " ' Austria According to Voltaire , by the 1700s the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy , Roman , nor an empire . But the Austrian family of Hapsburg managed to emerge from the ruin to build an empire of their own . By 1740 Austria was a populous empire of great military strength . However when the Hapsburg throne passed to 23-year-old Maria Theresa , the empire and its leader were tested . Frederick II of Prussia was the first to invade when Maria Theresa was pregnant with her first child . But far from buckling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although some territory was lost , the empire survived , and Maria Theresa bore nine more children , one of whom we encounter again as the French queen Marie Antoinette. // Joseph , her son , embraced Enlightenment , but unfortunately a bit too quickly . He abolished serfdom , and he ordered tolerance of all religion to the point of making Jews responsible for military service for the first time in Europe . But the Catholic church opposed him , and some segments of his population rose in revolt . When his brother Leopold succeeded Joseph , he had too much to straighten out in Austria to be able to help his sister in France . Russia The leader of Russia at the opening of the 1700s , Peter the Great , saw Enlightenment as westernization , and to this end he built up St. Petersburg and founded the Academy of Sciences . He also made European dress and the use of tobacco compulsory for members of his court . After his death he was succeeded by his wife , Catherine I , because he had put his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old ways . This first Catherine reigned for only two years , then was followed by a succession of tzars and tzarinas until another Catherine , Catherine the Great , dethroned her half-witted husband and reigned during the latter half of the 1700s . This ruthless woman of German origins and many lovers , took steps to codify Russian laws , restrict torture , and remodel local government , but then responded to a serf rebellion in 1773 with iron-handed repression . Rebel leaders were drawn and quartered , nobles given more power , so that Russian serfdom became virtually the equivalent of slavery . She said to an encyclopedist of the time , on the subject of reforms , " You write only on paper , but I have to write on human skin , which is incomparably more irritable and ticklish. " 2 France France in 1700 was a wealthy country with three times as many people as England , twice as many as Spain , and a government that was the epitome of absolute monarchy . Louis XIV , the Sun King , inherited his throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the age of 77 . He was able to state , quite correctly , that " the state , that is I. " And Louis XIV made war an affair of state : He revamped the military system // so that soldiers now fought for him , not regional leaders . He integrated artillery into the army , systematized military ranks , clarified the chain of command , and placed himself at the top . But the Sun King 's successor , Louis XV , inherited the Sun King 's two problems : high military costs and an inefficient system of taxation . Neither problem was insurmountable , but Louis XV had no will to tackle them , which points up another weakness of absolute family rule : If a leader chose to be indifferent , there is little that could be done . Little that is short of revolt , which is of course what happened . But before we describe the next reign of violence , let us look at the accomplishments of this period of peace . THE ENLIGHTENMENT AND SCIENCE For science the enlightened approach was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic . Newton and Descartes had made it appear that all systems in the natural world could eventually be described by mathematical formulas , and for such disciplines as physics , the approach brought gratifying results : Newton 's gravity and his laws of motion described the behavior of objects on Earth , and Kepler 's law described the behavior of the planets . But then physicists were dealing with the macroscopic world ? a world they could see or manipulate . Chemists have never had this luxury . The scale of their world is atomic , and the activity of atoms has to be inferred rather than observed . So in the early 1700s chemists did not yet have the tools to reduce their systems to exact mathematical models . But they had the desire . PHLOGISTON The 1500s had given a purposeful redirection to chemistry ( shifting emphasis from gold to medicine ) , but the basic alchemical theory remained the same . Materials were made of an admixture of some small number of elements : the air , earth , water , and fire of Aristotle , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to include mercury and sulfur ( the Arabic notion ) ; mercury , sulfur , and salt ( the Paracelsean notion ) ; or the fusible , the fatty , and the fluid ( Becher 's notion ) . // Chemistry consisted of trying to alter the proportion of these elements In what was n't wanted to make what was wanted . But by the 1600s the chemists had tried about all the combinations they could , and they found that they still did not have much control over the end product . They were starting to see that the Aristotelean hypothesis would fail . But before it was thrown out completely , it underwent one last resurgence in the theory of phlogiston . This time however hypothesis testing and rejection took about a hundred years instead of 2000 . It is tempting to try to describe phlogiston in the clear , precise terms we have become accustomed to now , but chemists in the early 1700s did not find it necessary to do so . Although it was generally agreed that phlogiston was a material that left burning substances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one had measured its weight , and some said it was weightless . It was supposed to have some combining power , but no exact proportions were proposed . For some chemists this flexibility in the system amounted to irritating imprecision . But other chemists were quite comfortable because the flexibility allowed them to explain most phenomena in terms of phlogiston . For instance there was the burning question of combustion . CALCINATION AND COMBUSTION It is worth a few lines to explain combustion and calcination as they are currently understood and to show how phlogiston was used to explain them . In ideal combustion , oxygen from the air combines with hydrogen and carbon in the fuel to produce carbon dioxide gas ( a carbon-oxygen compound ) and water ( a hydrogen-oxygen compound ) . In a real fire however , combustion is not complete , so there are other products formed , such as soot and smoke , which complicated the picture for these early chemists . The phlogiston theory explained combustion by saying that something ? namely , phlogiston ? left the material that burned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not an illogical conclusion . Chemists had no reason to believe that something ( oxygen ) was going into the burning material . In calcination , oxygen from the air combines with a hot metal . Tarnish is caused by oxygen from the air combining with clean // metal . So clean copper-bottomed pots eventually tarnish in air , but copper-bottomed pots heated while cooking tarnish more quickly due to calcination . In the 1700s calcination was viewed as a process similar to combustion , which it is . But here chemists had evidence that something was going into the calcined material because the material gained weight . But chemists at the beginning of the 1700s were not yet completely aware of the significance of mass in chemical reactions , and they did not routinely include mass measurements as a part of their investigations . Besides the visual evidence of flames leaving the fire was so compelling that they felt it was easier to adjust the notion of phlogiston than question their own eyes . So when explanations were offered , chemists gave phlogiston either a negative weight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there was nothing else in common experience that behaved this way . Chemists realized more information was needed . As the chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele said , " I soon realized that it was not possible to form an opinion on the phenomena of fire as long as one did not understand air . " 3 THE PNEUMATICK CHEMISTS We now know that the air we breathe is a mixture of gases : about three-fourths nitrogen and the rest oxygen with a little bit of argon , carbon dioxide , and water vapor thrown in . In the early 1700s however air was considered one substance ( and so it certainly appears to be ) . Though Helmont 's term gas was useful because it emphasized the novelty of this previously undescribed phase of matter , the term was not widely used in the 1700s . Instead gases were called airs and thought of as various states of common air , though later distinguished by adjectives describing their properties . The group of chemists who studied the various airs were later called pneumatic chemists or pneumatick , as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scottish family , Joseph Black 's father was a wine merchant , his mother was the daughter of a wine merchant , and Joseph was the fourth of their 12 children . He was educated by his mother // until he was 12 , then sent to Belfast and from there to the University of Glasgow . Having to choose a profession ( and chemistry not yet being a choice ) , Black chose medicine , but he enjoyed chemistry most in Ins course of study and for 3 years assisted William Cullen , the chemistry instructor . For his MD thesis Black chose to look for a solvent for kidney and gall stones so that they could be removed without surgery ? a laudable study in these pre-anesthesia days . At first Black thought to study a solution of quicklime ( calcium oxide ) because he knew it would dissolve the stones , but unfortunately it also destroyed tissue . Because of this and because it was not at all clear that quicklime from different sources was the same compound ( one of Black 's professors preferred quicklime made from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Black chose to avoid controversy and study magnesia alba ( magnesium carbonate ) instead . Though Black soon found that magnesia alba did not dissolve kidney stones , he was intrigued by its other properties , such as its effectiveness as a laxative , so he continued his study . From this study came his insights into the nature of air . First Black found that magnesia alba gave off bubbles when treated with acid , as did other materials then known as mild alkalis . These mild alkalis are in fact carbonate salts , which we now know give off bubbles of carbon dioxide when treated with acid . In continued experiments Black subjected the magnesia alba to strong heating , then treated the residue with acids . He found the residue formed the same salts as the unheated material but gave off no bubbles . On the basis of this , Black decided that the bubble-forming gas was in fact part of the magnesia alba that had been driven off with heating . He repeated the heating , this time planning to trap the gas over water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . Undaunted he set off on a series of methodical experiments that used weight differences to determine the amount of gas in the material . Black weighed the material before and after heating and assumed the difference was the weight of the gas lost . He weighed portions of magnesia alba and acid , mixed them , and after all the bubbling had ceased , weighed the residue , and assumed the difference was the weight of the gas . Then bringing everything together , he showed that // the gas from magnesia alba was the same as the gas given off by mild alkalis . He heated the magnesia alba to drive off the gas , dissolved the residue in acid , added an excess of a mild alkali to replace the gas driven off by heating , and obtained the same weight of magnesia albaa demonstration of the conservation of mass . Interestingly in this series of experiments , no weight is attributed to phlogiston , so Black could have explained all of the preceding experiments without resorting to the phlogiston theory . But chameleon that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phlogiston theory , Black decided magnesia alba gained phlogiston when heated at the same time it lost the gas that had caused the bubbles . Black continued his studies but now concentrated on the gas instead of magnesia alba . He found that his gas made limewater cloudy , as did gas given off by burning wood . We now know that this is because they are both carbon dioxide , and carbon dioxide forms a fine suspension of calcium carbonate ( or chalk ) in solutions of calcium hydroxide ( limewater ) . Black then showed that the gas given off in fermentation also turns limewater milky as does gas that the human body exhales . He concluded that combustion , respiration , and fermentation all produced the same gas and it was the same gas that was trapped ? or fixed ? in magnesia alba . He called it therefore fixed air . To demonstrate that fixed air was different from regular air , Black put two jars in an air pump , one containing just water and the other limewater . When a vacuum was created , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limewater did not turn milky . By experiments with birds and small animals , he demonstrated that fixed air , unlike common air , did not support life . With these results Black pushed experimental chemistry forward two giant steps : He clearly demonstrated that the identical gaseous compound could be isolated from several different reactions , and he clearly demonstrated the need to account for the mass of gaseous reagents and products in chemical reactions . Black published these momentous results in his MD thesis , then published very little for the rest of his career . Reasons for his lack of publications were probably both personal and professional . He replaced his teacher , Cullen , when Cullen moved to Edinburgh , and because students paid Black directly by fee , he had to lecture intensively to earn a reasonable income . The university at // Glasgow was also administered by its faculty , so Black had administrative duties , which took up much time . But he did continue to do research , and many of Black 's research results were disseminated in his lectures and became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact his work surfaces in another context soon . Black was also not a seeker of fame . He was apparently a quiet person of tenuous health , possibly asthmatic . Described as tall , very thin , and very pale , he had large , dark eyes and thin hair powdered and arranged in a long braid . He was also noted for meticulousness with finances , though not for the stinginess that this has sometimes been interpreted to be . Teaching was apparently his forte . His lectures were so popular that students who did not need the course still chose to attend ( which as any chemistry teacher will attest is unusual ) . Black stressed the practical and spent little time on theory unless it were thoroughly upheld by experiment . He rejected the idea of four elements , saying instead that materials should be separated into classes . Black eventually moved to Edinburgh ( replacing his mentor , Cullen , once again ) and taught there . He lived out his quiet bachelor 's life in the company of his friends ? including Adam Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? at the Philosophical Society ( or the Royal Society of Edinburgh , as it was called after the 1780s ) and those informal clubs for which Edinburgh was famous : the Select , the Poker , and the Oyster . Black 's contributions to chemistry were substantial and varied , but as with any teacher , his true success is best measured by the success of his students . One of these students was Daniel Rutherford , nephew of Sir Walter Scott , the novelist and poet . Daniel Rutherford In his MD thesis Daniel Rutherford discussed Black 's fixed air and called it mephitic air ? the mephitis was a legendary noxious , pestilential , foul exhalation from the Earth ? probably because the gas did not support respiration . Rutherford observed that common air has a " good " part that is able to support respiration ; when this is used up , the rest can not support life . He knew that part of the good air had been converted into fixed air ( carbon dioxide ) by respiration , so at first Rutherford speculated that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed air . But after he removed the carbon dioxide by passing the gas through limewater , the remaining gases still did not support combustion or respiration . The observation that this residue , which we know as nitrogen , was different from common air was made by Priestley , Cavendish , and Scheele ( other chemists who are discussed shortly ) at about the same time . But Rutherford is generally given credit for the discovery of nitrogen because he was the first to publish it ( in his MD thesis ) . He did not however recognize nitrogen as a distinct chemical species ; he believed it to be atmospheric air saturated with phlogiston or phlogisticated air . In combustion it was thought that phlogiston left materials and went into the air , so Rutherford reasoned that if the air over a material were already saturated with phlogiston , combustion could not take place . Phlogiston worked equally well as a theoretical framework for the next worker , Priestley , when he isolated his dephlogisticated air . Joseph Priestley An English chemist whose name has become synonymous with political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorkshire cloth dresser , was raised by his Calvanist maternal grandparents , probably because of his mother 's poor health . When his mother died , the boy , only six , was sent to live with an aunt . At his aunt 's home he came in contact with the Presbyterian philosophy , and he eventually trained to become a Presbyterian minister . In his choice of the Presbyterian ministry as a career , we see early evidence of Priestley 's capacity for independent action : As a Presbyterian he became a member of a dissenting religion ( that is , a religion other than the Church of England ) , and the ministry involved public speaking , which he took on despite an inherited speech impediment . Beyond this we find that Priestley supported the cause of the colonists over the crown in the U. S. war of independence ( a view that was not favored in England ) and rejected the Trinity , stating what would come to be known as the Unitarian view that " Jesus was in nature solely and truly a man , however highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few sympathizers among Christians at that time ) . // After completing his studies Priestley went rapidly through two ministerial jobs ( his unorthodox views were not very popular with traditional congregations ) , and while holding the second position , he opened a school . At the time English universities were open only to male students who were congregants of the Church of England . Those who dissented from the Anglican doctrines set up their own schools , called the dissenting academies , and these were often more progresive than the traditional universities . Priestley 's school was so successful that it won him a position at a well-known dissenting academy in Warrington . There he was asked to teach languages , history , law , oratory , and anatomy and other science ? but not , it may be noted , theology . Required to teach science , Priestley found he had to learn some . As part of his studies , he wrote a History of Electricity , an effort that was encouraged by Benjamin Franklin , whom he had met in London . With an apparent propensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilkinson of a famous family of ironmasters whose work is illustrative of the industrial trend in England . However with his new family responsibilities ( and perhaps a bit of his lifelong penchant for rancor ) , he moved from his teaching position back into the ministry in the town of Leeds . At Leeds Priestley lived next door to a brewery , which Joseph Black had shown was a good source of his " fixed air , " carbon dioxide . Priestley with his ever lively mind began to study this gas . In the course of his studies , he noticed that not only did the gas dissolve in water , but when it did , it produced a pleasant drink . This invention of soda water ( the very same soda water that is the basis for today 's billion-dollar , international soft-drink industry ) won him the prestigious Copley Medal from the Royal Society of London , and his scientific career was off and running . ( It is of passing interest to note that Priestley in this same period discovered that rubber from South America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention to which these authors owe much . ) Priestley was soon recruited by the Earl of Shelburne to be his secretary , resident intellectual , librarian , and adviser to the household tutor . Priestley did most of his work on gases during the 8 years that he served Shelburne at Shelburne 's quiet country house in the // southwest of England . Priestley was able to isolate carbon dioxide by bubbling it through a pool of mercury into an inverted glass bulb ( the carbon dioxide did not dissolve in mercury as it did in water ) , and in this manner he was also able to work " nitrous air , " which is now known as nitric oxide . Many chemists had noted the red ? brown fumes generated when nitric acid attacked metals , but colorless nitric oxide had gone unnoticed . Priestley found that his nitrous air , on standing over iron filings , forms another gas that can cause a candle to burn more brightly than usual . This gas , nitrous oxide , he called " dephlogisticated nitrous air " because in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so because it was deficient in phlogiston ( which gave phlogiston in the burning material somewhere to go ) . Priestley further reasoned that nitrous air was rich in phlogiston and dephlogisticated nitrous air was formed when iron drew phlogiston from the nitrous air ? not unreasonable , given the phlogiston system . The brown fumes of nitrogen dioxide , Priestley found , were formed when nitric oxide reacts with common air . This brown gas was novel at the time , but it has become all too familiar to everyone in large cities today . High temperatures of combustion in gasoline engines generate nitric oxide from the nitrogen and oxygen in the air . This nitric oxide reacts now as it did then : It combines with oxygen in air to form the familiar brown fumes whose accumulations in atmospheric inversion layers are a large component of smog . Priestley was a couple of centuries removed from this concern , but he did find a use for the reaction . When nitric oxide reacted with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide ( that is , with two oxygen atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminished the volume of oxygen in the air . In fact Priestley noted that it diminished the volume of common air by about one-fifth . This gave him a method for measuring what he called the " fitness " or " goodness " of air for respiration ( which was in fact its oxygen content ) . His test was more quantitative than timing how long the air supports respiration in mice ( which depended on the size and condition of the mouse ) and eventually evolved into an instrument for measuring oxygen content of air called the eudiometer . Priestley went on to isolate and study hydrogen chloride gas ( made from sulfuric acid heated with common salt , sodium chloride ) and // ammonia gas ( noting when he sparked a sample that he obtained hydrogen and nitrogen ) . Then in what must have been a gratifying experiment , he mixed hydrogen chloride and ammonia and saw them come together in a fine white cloud that settled into a soft pile of ammonium chloride crystals . Then in August 1774 Priestley prepared oxygen by collecting the gas driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the first to do so soon became the subject of lively debate , but in August 1744 Priestley certainly believed he was the first . He found that a candle burned brightly in his new gas and that heated charcoal glowed . When quite as a second thought , he put a burning candle into a sample that he had allowed to react with nitric oxide , he saw that it still supported combustion , and he concluded that he had a new gas ? one that supported combustion more than ordinary air . Priestley wrote : I can not , at this distance of time , recollect what it was that I had in view in making this experiment ; but I knpw I had no expectation of the real issue of it . If ... I had not happened for some other purpose , to have had a lighted candle before me , I should probably never have made the trial ; and the whole train of my future experiments relating to this kind of air might have been prevented . ' Because his new gas was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called it " dephlogisticated air . " In October Priestley went with Lord Shelburne to Europe to meet and discuss his results with a certain French chemist , Antoine Laurent Lavoisier . ( Lavoisier at this time was formulating his own ideas about air and combustion , and his meeting with Priestley had repercussions , as we shall soon see . ) By March 1775 convinced of his priority in the discovery of the new gas , Priestley wrote : " Hitherto only two mice and myself have had the privilege of breathing it . " ' Besides his interest in gas experiments , Priestley , a prodigious worker and writer , produced volumes on theology , history , education , metaphysics , language , aesthetics , and politics . He wrote so voluminously about his gases , that the Royal Society suggested that he use a vehicle for publication other than the Philosophical Transactions . // Between 1774 and 1786 Priestley wrote six volumes of Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air . After 1780 Priestley chose to leave the service of Lord Shelburne ( a decision possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second marriage ) , but the parting must not have been too acrimonious because Priestley retained an annuity from Lord Shelburne for the rest of his life . And the change coincided with other social difficulties . He had never been welcomed by the membership of the Royal Society for political and religious reasons , and it is said that Cavendish , our next subject for discussion , avoided him entirely . So after leaving his patron , Priestley decided to relocate in Birmingham . In Birmingham he headed the New Meeting House , one of the most liberal congregations in England and became associated with the Lunar Society , an informal collection of provincial intellectuals , scientists , and industrialists who met during the full moon ( when it was easier to travel at night ) . During the years of Priestley 's attendance , the Lunar Society included ( among others ) Erasmus Darwin , Richard Edgeworth , Jonathan Stokes , James Watt , and Josiah Wedgwood . Members supported his research intellectually and financially , and Priestley must have finally felt at home . Priestley however continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille , a " Church and King " riot ( not seriously discouraged by the authorities ) destroyed the New Meeting House and Priestley 's home and laboratory . Priestley retreated to London , but even there he felt increasing threats of political persecution . He finally moved with most of his family to the United States . He was offered a professorship in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania , but he opted to settle with other British political refugees in the quiet of rural Pennsylvania . In his new house and laboratory in his new country , he went to work . By passing steam over glowing charcoal , he managed to generate a new gas ( now known as carbon monoxide ) that burned with a beautiful blue flame . Priestley died in 1804 , and when mourners met at his grave 70 years later to recognize the one-hundredth anniversary of his discovery of oxygen , they decided to form a society ? the American Chemical Society ? an important force in developments to come . ' Priestley never ca. 1700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the phlogiston theory , and he continued his political diatribes , too , taking the side of Jefferson against the administration of John Adams . Ironically when Jefferson was elected president and became his personal friend , Priestley was able to die within the current political fold ? a rather unfitting end for this cantankerous , antisocial , anti-establishment man . But then antisocial behavior seems to have been common among pneumatic chemists , as evidenced by our next chemist , Henry Cavendish . Cavendish was the first to study hydrogen , the infamous gas of the Hindenberg dirigible explosion . Cavendish calmly calls it his inflammable air . Henry Cavendi Born of aristocratic lineage , Henry Cavendish had no title , but he was independently wealthy all his life . He went to Cambridge but took no degree , a practice not uncommon for a person in his position . After Cambridge he lived with his father in London , where he built a laboratory and workshop , then started on his unique career of unrestricted scientific investigation . Cavendish seems to be one of the few characters we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were free of ulterior motivation . A reclusive soul , Cavendish never married , and he avoided frivolous society . His father was a member of the Royal Society , and he helped his son to find a place in London scientific circles . Elected to the Royal Society , Cavendish attended meetings faithfully . He shunned publicity , writing fewer than 20 articles during his 50 years of productivity , but when he did publish , the work was careful and exhaustive . His publications also covered a broad range ? electricity , freezing points , the density of the Earth ? and of interest to us here , pneumatic chemistry . Cavendish 's first paper in fact was on " factitious " airs , that is , gases fixed in some material but capable of being freed , such as carbon dioxide in carbonates . One of these factitious airs was his inflammable air , hydrogen gas , which he collected from metals treated with acid . When Cavendish sparked his inflammable air with Priestley 's dephlogisticated air ( oxygen ) , he found that water was formed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Priestley , Watt , and others . Cavendish concluded that his inflammable air ( hydrogen ) , soaked up by dephlogisticated air ( oxygen ) , must be pure phlogiston . And hydrogen with its light weight and explosive characteristics certainly had attributes expected of phlogiston . There was however a hitch : Cavendish found that the water he produced contained a small amount of nitric acid . Cavendish concluded ( correctly ) that this was caused by Rutherford 's phlogisticated air ( nitrogen ) present as an impurity in his dephlogisticated air . Before he would publish , he carefully confirmed this by continually sparking and removing nitric acid . When no further nitrogen or oxygen could be removed , he found that a small volume of gas still remained . This unreacted volume , about 1 percent of the original volume , went unexplained for over a hundred years until Rayleigh and Ramsay identified it as atmospheric argon . As combustion has always had its fascination , so have explosions , and this new inflammable gas , hydrogen , was capable of both . At least one daredevil was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as it was exhaled . However when he tried to do the same with a mixture of hydrogen and common air , " the consequence was an explosion so dreadful that I imagined my teeth were all blown out . " Dr. Jacques Charles ( a name we encounter again ) constructed the first hydrogen-filled balloon , and for the entertainment of some 300 thousand spectators , he climbed in and made aerial history . Cavendish himself was not one to participate in such theatrics and in fact he would not even teach nor hire out his chemical talents . He may best be described as socially clumsy : He dressed 50 years out of style in somewhat soiled , shabby clothes , and he always wore a highcoat collar . He had very rigid , exact habits , he was stingy ( with himself ) , and nonreligious . There are accounts that paint him as a misanthrope , but these accounts may be unfair : He was more blind to the human condition than unsympathetic to it . When his personal librarian fell on hard times after leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the librarian 's troubles , and Cavendish said he was sorry to hear it . It was only after the friend suggested a small annuity for the fellow that Cavendish finally responded , but then it was with 10,000 pounds ( a substantial fortune in those days ) . // For whatever reasons though , Cavendish was antisocial to the bitter end . On his deathbed he was attended only by his valet , and he even sent him away , asking not to be disturbed until a certain hour . When the valet returned at that hour , he found his employer dead . We begin to suspect that there was something in the air of these pneumatic chemists , because our next subject also seems to have had his own peculiar social habits . Carl Wilhelm Scheele Swedish Carl Wilhelm Scheele , the seventh of 11 children , chose pharmacy for a career , but he was more interested in doing research on chemicals than in producing them for sale . After his apprenticeship however , he had to work for 13 years as a production technician before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of a pharmacist 's widow looking for someone to manage her husband 's business . Scheele applied for the job , but he found the business financially burdened and realized that the widow would soon be forced to sell . Scheele and the widow struck a deal in which Scheele agreed to manage the pharmacy for 1 year and in that time try to position himself financially so that he would be able to negotiate its purchase . The widow held negotiations with another potential buyer unbeknownst to Scheele , and the opportunity was almost lost . Local customers however were so happy with Scheele 's work that they demanded that he be allowed to continue , and so he did . The young widow signed the pharmacy over to him and stayed on as his housekeeper . As a confirmed phlogistonist , Scheele set out to study the effects of phlogiston on gases . Observing that combustion reduced the volume of air and that the unrespirable air remaining was less dense than common air , he reasoned that phlogiston from the combustible material combined with a component of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable working hypothesis . Scheele called the unknown component of the air fire-air , and he was determined to isolate it . Because nitric acid acts on some metals to produce oxides and the same thing occurs when the metal is heated in air , he reasoned that nitric acid must absorb phlogiston from the metal the way air does // when the metal is heated . Therefore if heat is , as he suspected , phlogiston plus fire-air , then contacting heat with nitric acid would draw off the phlogiston and leave the fire-air . To try this experimentally , he " fixed " the nitric acid ( made a solid ) by allowing it to react with potassium hydroxide , then heated the resulting potassium nitrate in a retort fitted with a bladder containing a salt that absorbed nitrogen oxides . As he had hoped , the bladder filled with a gas in which a taper burned brightly . Moreover when mixed with depleted air , the air was restored to respirable , common air . Scheele had isolated oxygen and named it fire-air . But like his taper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He died at age 44 , but by that time he had accomplished a great deal . He had also known the warmth of companionship because the widow was at his side . Shortly before his health failed , he willed the pharmacy to her , and 2 days before his death , they sealed the friendship with marriage . Though not isolated , Scheele was somewhat off the trodden path : Although his laboratory notes show that he probably isolated oxygen earlier than Priestley , when Scheele finally published his results , oxygen was already well-known . But then it is a well-recognized phenomenon that given the same set of data , more than one mind will arrive at the same conclusion . Therefore it is difficult ( and really not that enlightening ) to try to assign priority to each advance in science . What is interesting is to see how many people came up with the idea and in how many different ways . For instance the work of Mikhail Vasilevich Lomonosov actually anticipated the breakthroughs detailed in the next chapter . This chemist however was Russian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beaten path ? though not for long . As Lomonosov challenged Russian youth , the time was coming " to show that the Russian land can give birth to its own Platos and quickwitted Newtons . Mikhail Vasilevich Lomonosov Gifted with special linguistic abilities , Mikhail Lomonosov learned to read and write at an early age . He went to study in Moscow at the age of 20 against his father 's wishes , and on his own slim budget , he // managed to travel to Germany and Holland . After that he returned to St. Petersburg to marry and stayed in Russia for the rest of his life . A man with an unusual mix of abilities , he wrote poetry , a textbook on grammar , and a textbook on rhetoric . But it often takes a creative as well as an analytical mind for insights into science . Lomonosov 's insight was that he refused to see phlogiston where there was none . He heated metals in air-tight vessels and found ? contrary to Boyle ? no increase in the weight of the system . Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain these results . He believed they could be accounted for by assuming that something from the air combined with the metal . Unfortunately Lomonosov did not have the scientific stature , nor did any Russian at the time , for his views to be widely influential . Before such ideas gained acceptance , they would have to be advanced by a nation viewed as more scientifically acceptable : precisely the role written for France in the 1700s . But wherever they occurred , breakthroughs were inevitable ; the theory of phlogiston was clearly an effort to fit a square peg into a round hole . In the 1700s physics and astronomy became so systematic that it seemed only right that chemistry should behave the same . As if by sheer effort of desire , chemists had come up with phlogiston , hoping it would be the unifying system for them . But the theory of phlogiston is more than an historical artifact : It shows that a search for fact can be influenced by a desire to work within an established framework of thought and that it is possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which Stahl imbued phlogiston made it possible to use it to describe a number of phenomena : The worst criticism seemed to be that it was unnecessary to invoke it to explain all results . With each success it became more entrenched , and it looked more and more as if it would take a revolution to overthrow it . In the end , it did . chapter EIGHT ca. 1700 : Revolution ! T he remark in the last chapter that France was the scientifically acceptable culture of the 1700s may have caused a few curious second readings because in the last chapter we detailed the work of one Russian , two Scottish , one Swedish , and two English but no French chemists . The reason for this however was not a lack of material but rather such a surplus of material that it warrants a chapter unto itself . France was the center of European Enlightenment , and in France this passion for throwing off tradition took the extreme form : revolution . France in the 1700s saw two revolutions ? one political and one chemical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom for individuals . In France there was a keen need for freedom and equality : The country was in financial trouble , and those who were bearing the burden of the debt were powerless to do anything about 151 // it . Under the tax system the church and the nobles did not pay taxes , and the bourgeoisie ( middle class ) that did pay had to go through organizations of private tax collectors called tax farms . These tax farms purchased the privilege of collecting taxes by prepaying to the monarchy , then descended on the populace to collect the taxes and whatever profit they could . Toward the close of Louis XV 's reign there were more than a million beggars in a French population of around twentythree million ? one out of every 23 people . Louis XVI , a well-meaning but naive and weak monarch , tried some tax reforms , but he only managed to anger the nobles . Inspired by the Enlightenment and the United States ' war of independence , some of these nobles formed a National Assembly to institute government reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French people remained dissatisfied . In addition to bad harvests , trade slowed when the United States ' war of independence ended , and the economy became depressed . Peasants refused to pay manorial dues and taxes . The Bastille was stormed by city dwellers attempting to arm themselves against hungry hordes from the country . In response the National Assembly nationalized church lands , abolished the feudal system , and created a system of centralized representative government . But the government got off to a shaky start . In the midst of all this political strife , the philosophic debate on phlogiston also heated red hot . Scientists were polarized into phlogiston and antiphlogiston camps , basing their views on nationalistic and personal reasons as much as on experimentation . The debate was finally resolved , but with a resolution radical enough to constitute a revolution of its own . THE CHEMICAL REVOLUTION The Chemical Revolution was a revolution against the mysticism of the alchemists , the authority of the Scholastics , and the autocracy of the philosophy of the long-dead Aristotle . The weapons in this war were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate result of the Chemical Revolution was to redefine chemical elements as separate materials with separate identities and propru. // erties . The long-term result was to reject chemical theory based on impressionistic speculation and replace it with theory based strictly on verifiable experimental results . Although there were many players in this philosophic drama , there was decidedly one central figure : Antoine Laurent Lavoisier ? chemist , tax collector , and believer that the balance sheets in science must add up as well . When Lavoisier did the books , phlogiston did not fit in . ANTOINE LAURENT LAVOISIER Lavoisier 's family was part of the prosperous French bourgeois , and Lavoisier 's youth consequently was comfortable . His father was a lawyer , his mother the well-dowered daughter of a lawyer , and Lavoisier was an adored , indulged , and idolized child . Though he was one of two children , his sister died in her teens , and when his mother died when he was 5 years old , his recently widowed maternal grandmother and a maiden aunt took over his care . He was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for him to chose a profession , he started out ( naturally ) by studying law . But acting on what was probably a suggestion by a family friend , the geologist Guettard , he also attended popular courses in chemistry given in the Jardin du Roi . The main speaker at these lectures was Professor Bourdelain , but apparently more people went to see demonstrations following the lecture than to hear the main lecture itself . Performed by the lively apothecary , Guillaume-Francois Rouelle , the demonstrations sometimes contradicted the very theory that the main speaker had just proposed . According to several accounts Rouelle was so unabashedly enthusiastic about his subject that he arrived at the lecture properly attired , but during the course of the demonstration , he stripped off wig and waistcoat and carried on his show in shirtsleeves . Though described by some as untutored and semiliterate , Rouelle 's unconventional style achieved its purpose : He captured the interest of his audience , and his audience included Lavoisier . Though Lavoisier passed the bar examination in the 1760s , his interest in chemistry did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a mineral survey of Alsace and Lorraine , and at the age of 21 he decided to become a member of the Academy of Science . Created in 1666 the French Academy of Science fills the same role as the Royal Society in England : It provides a forum for discussion , a vehicle for publication , and some laboratory facilities for experimentation . Like the Royal Society , membership in the French Academy of Science is by election . While Lavoisier 's father and aunt would not have been averse to pulling strings to gain his election , Lavoisier did not need their help . His research into better methods for public street lighting was published by the academy and rewarded by a gold medal from the king . He became an associate member of the academy by the time he was 25 and a regular member when he was 26 . Shortly after his election he justified further the academy 's decision by performing a fine piece of original research : the water transmutation experiment . With this experiment he demonstrated his intention to take seriously the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the proponents of phlogiston : the conservation of mass . Water Transmutation Experiment It had long been believed and was an article of alchemical dogma that repeated and prolonged heating caused water to transmute into earth . This is because a residue is generally found when water evaporates to dryness ( the well-known " water spots " on dishes ) . In truth water is such an excellent solvent for inorganic salts that it is difficult to obtain absolutely pure water ? that is , water that does not leave some residue . Because water with dissolved salts may appear completely transparent , there was no reason for alchemists to suspect that deposits found after evaporating water were actually materials dissolved in the water in the first place . But Lavoisier believed that this transmutation should be put to the test . Carefully including the mass measurements that were now beginning to be recognized as important , he weighed some distilled water , sealed it in a glass container , then heated the container for 101 days . When he weighed the sealed system , he found no change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water from the outside through the glass . Some // flecks of material appeared in the water , but when he weighed the water and the dry container separately , he found that the container had lost a weight equal to the weight of material suspended in the water . In other words the material in the water was not formed by transmutation but rather by some sloughing off of bits of material from the walls of the glass container . Thus with one well-planned and wellexecuted experiment , Lavoisier refuted an established theory of alchemists and demonstrated that valid chemical theory must be experimentally verifiable . Talented though he was , Lavoisier , like other scientists of the time , had to finance his own experiments . In an effort to achieve financial security , he made one of the best and one of the worst moves of his life : He used his inheritance from his mother to purchase membership in a tax-collecting firm . Why this was one of his worst moves , we shall presently see . It was one of his best moves because he met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , Marie . Marie Paulze was to became Lavoisier 's wife before she turned 14. // Marie Anne Pierrette Paulze Lavoisier Educated in a convent since the death of her mother when Marie was 3 years old , Marie Anne Pierrette Paulze Lavoisier had talent in both art and languages . She must also have had some innate proclivity for science , because she immediately became involved in Lavoisier 's scientific work : translating scientific papers , working in the laboratory , keeping laboratory notebooks , and making illustrations of experimental setups . Lavoisier , now well settled , well financed , and well assisted , started on what was to be his most important work : to use the principle of the conservation of mass to revolutionize chemistry . When Lavoisier learned of a report by a Paris pharmacist , Pierre Mitouard , that phosphorus seemed to absorb air when it was burned to form acid . Lavoisier repeated the experiment with phosphorus , then with sulfur , and found that the acids produced did indeed weigh more than the starting materials . He wrote down these results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practice common for his times and similar to today 's practice of notarizing notebooks to ensure credit for originality . ( It took several years for articles submitted to the Academy 's journal to be published . ) Working with colleagues at the Academy , Lavoisier burned a diamond in the focus of a giant burning glass . As a combustion product he found carbon dioxide , the gas described by Black as fixed air . In other experiments he heated metal oxides ( calxes ) in the presence of charcoal and found fixed air again given off . Ruminating on these results , he wrote in a notebook with characteristic assurance : all this work ... seemed to be destined to bring about a revolution in physics and chemistry . I have felt bound to look upon all that has been done before me as suggestive . I have proposed to repeat it all with new safeguards , in order to link our knowledge of the air that goes into combination or that is liberated from substances , with other acquired knowledge , and to form a theory ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he identified his air . // Oxygen In October 1774 Lord Shelburne and his secretary , Joseph Priestley , arrived in Paris . In the course of their visit they dined with Lavoisier and several other French scientists . During this dinner Priestley told the assembled company about the new air he had found that caused a candle to burn brighter than in common air . How much of Lavoisier 's subsequent work depended on this revelation by Priestley is debatable , but afterward Priestley was certainly willing to debate it . Lavoisier had already investigated air absorbed by metals on heating and ? although he believed it was Black 's fixed air , carbon dioxide ? with or without Priestley 's new information , he probably would have eventually associated it with oxygen . Lavoisier may have already known about Scheele 's fire-air , and he probably knew that other investigators , such as Pierre Bayen , had observed a gas being given off when heating mercuric oxide . But by whatever route Lavoisier arrived at his own conclusions , and by March 1775 he was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gas closely resembling common air . Priestley , on reading Lavoisier 's result , pointed out that the gas had a " goodness " ? an ability to support combustion ? that was greater than common air , citing his own tests with nitric oxide . Lavoisier tried the test on a sample of what he called " dephlogisticated air of M. Prisley sic , " 2 and he found what Priestley had said to be true . But on April 25 , 1775 he read a paper to the academy on " the nature of the principle which combines with metals during calcination and increases their weight , " 3 he did not mention the contributions of Priestley , Scheele , or Bayen , and he did not invoke phlogiston . It is clear that Lavoisier believed he deserved some credit for the discovery of oxygen , and while Lavoisier was certainly not the first to isolate this gas physically and explore its properties , he should be credited with being the first to recognize that this air was not just a variety of common air but a pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit for his strict adherence to the balance sheet of mass , which left no room for phlogiston . In 1775 Lavoisier was appointed scientific director of the Royal Gunpowder Administration , and he and Marie moved to the Paris Arsenal . Here Lavoisier set up a laboratory and immediately found pro158 chapter EIGHT cedures to improve the quality of the potassium nitrate used for French gunpowder . Here he also carried out experiments , assisted by Marie Lavoisier and others ( to be met shortly ) , on combustion and respiration , and he began to publish papers clarifying his ideas on the role of oxygen . In a paper published in 1777 , he concluded that all acids contain a portion of the " purest part of the air . " ' To name this part of the air , he used the term oxygene from the Greek , by which he meant to imply acid former , but this assumption was wrong . While it is true that oxygen is part of carbonic , sulfuric , nitric , and many organic acids , it is not a component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out to Lavoisier at the time . Lavoisier countered that this only appeared to be the case , and that the composition of hydrochloric acid had not yet been fully established . Given our present understanding of chemistry , the idea that the presence of an element in a compound determines the nature of a compound ? that is , if it has oxygen , then it must be an acid ? is clearly an oversimplification . Sodium chloride , table salt , is present in virtually everyone 's diet and generally causes few problems . In fact saltwater , or normal saline solution , is given intravenously to prevent dehydration . Sodium however is a metal that reacts violently with water , and chlorine is a highly toxic gas . Clearly sodium chloride does not derive its properties solely from the properties of sodium and chlorine . Lavoisier 's conviction that the presence of oxygen gave acids their nature was similar to residual Aristotelian ideas about the qualities associated with elements : Fire is hot and dry , water is cold and moist , and so forth . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pervasive nature of the four elements . Whereas Lavoisier had managed to step free of the latter , the former may still have influenced his thinking on acids . However it was this persuasion that led him to the next famous experiment we discuss and to an accusation of plagiarism . The Composition of Water Several workers had noticed that water formed when a mixture of hydrogen with oxygen ( or common air ) was sparked , but they were cautious in their conclusions . Priestley sparked hydrogen with common // air and found water , but he did not publish these results . James Watt , of steam engine fame , also tried the experiment , as did Henry Cavendish . Cavendish prepared a large sample of water by the method , but he did not immediately publish his results because he found his water to be slightly acidic . He located his acid source ? small amounts of nitrogen in the oxygen that formed nitric oxides , which react with water to form acid ? and then published his results , but by then others ? among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's assistant , Charles Blagden ( another person to whom Cavendish left a considerable annuity ) visited Paris in 1783 . There he congenially and benignly conveyed information on the experiments of Cavendish and Watt to Lavoisier . Lavoisier , who had thought that an acid should be formed from the oxygen ? hydrogen mixture , verified that water was the only product , then went one step further and decomposed water by running steam through a red-hot gun barrel and collected hydrogen and iron oxide as his products . Lavoisier did not hesitate . He made the pronouncement that water was not an element as previously thought but the combination of oxygen with an inflammable principle , which he named hydrogen , from the Greek for the begetter of water . He claimed priority for this discovery , making only slight reference to the work of others . There was perhaps understandably a furor . Watt felt that Cavendish and Lavoisier had used some of his ideas , but of course all three owed some debt to Priestley . Again it may be asserted that the significance of Lavoisier 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in his interpretation of the results . From the same results Cavendish concluded that inflammable air ( hydrogen ) was really water with added phlogiston . When it combined with dephlogisticated air ( oxygen ) , the result was just water . Lavoisier however saw it as the combination of two elements to form a compound , and he did not mention phlogiston . With these results Lavoisier was nearly ready to formulate his promised new theory that he believed was " destined to bring about a revolution in physics and chemistry . " ' But if this theory included an explanation of combustion , he knew he would have to account for the more // spectacular products of this particular reaction : heat and light . Lavoisier set out to do just that , working with a soon-to-be-famous younger colleague in the academy , Pierre-Simon , Marquis de Laplace . Pierre-Simon de Laplace Besides their interest in science these two men also seemed to have in common a strong belief in their own talents . Laplace considered himself the best mathematician in France , and he did not hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . But in the cases of Laplace and Lavoisier , it is hard to say that their self-assessmentsthough perhaps irritating ? were ill-founded . Laplace , unlike Lavoisier , did not extend his outspokenness to politics , which may have been fortunate for him . Lavoisier and Laplace developed a calorimeter , a device for measuring heat released during respiration and combustion . The device consisted of a chamber surrounded by an ice-packed jacket . The amount of water collected from melted ice was used to measure the heat evolved in the inner chamber . To improve the accuracy of the measurement , the whole device was insulated with another ice-packed jacket , and experiments were performed only on days when the outside temperature was a few degrees above freezing . With this device Laplace and Lavoisier measured the amount of heat that evolved in the combustion of charcoal to form carbon dioxide . They then measured the amount of heat generated by a guinea pig while collecting the carbon dioxide the animal exhaled . They compared the amount of heat generated by the animal with the amount of heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dioxide , and they obtained accurate enough results to conclude that respiration was a form of combustion . Despite this interesting experimental work , Lavoisier 's resulting explanations of the nature of heat and light seem forced . Laplace favored a mechanical explanation of heat as the motion of particles of matter ( as it is currently understood ) , but Lavoisier described heat as a substance . This material he called caloric , the matter of fire , and described it as weightless ( or too difficult to weigh ) , which made it reminiscent of phlogiston . But unlike the phlogistonists he could // quantitatively measure his matter of fire . He could not however clearly separate heat from light , and his description of light was not quantitative . Reflections on Phlogiston Not feeling that these were fatally weak points in his system , Lavoisier proceeded formally to attack the phlogiston theory . In 1783 he submitted a memoir entitled Reflections on Phlogiston to the academy . In Reflections he credited Stahl with the discovery that calcination is a form of combustion and with the observation that combustibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he proceeded to turn the whole system upside down . Calcination had been viewed as a separation ? phlogiston from metal ? but Lavoisier asserted it was a combination ? oxygen with metal . Reduction had been considered a combination ? metal with phlogiston , but Lavoisier made it a separation ? oxygen from metal . Oxygen , he said , was not a variety of the element air but a separate substance ? an element unto itself . And phlogiston was not just a variety of the element of fire ? phlogiston , he said , did not exist . Lavoisier had by no means arrived at a modern definition of an element . Instead he retained some of the Aristotelian notion that an element must be found everywhere . He wrote it is not enough for a substance to be simple , indivisible , or at least undecomposed for us to call it an element . It is also necessary for it to be abundantly distributed in nature and to enter as an essential and constituent principle in the composition of a great number of bodies . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionality ( which is an extension of the Aristotelian notion of fundamental properties of elements ) . His explanations of heat and light also required something like metaphysical faith for acceptance . His true accomplishments however were that he broke the Aristotelian barrier of four elements , established the conservation of mass as an inviolate law , and confirmed the need for verifiable experimental results as the basis for valid chemical theory . And for one lifetime , perhaps this was enough . // After learning of Lavoisier 's exposition , several other chemists , including most notably Claude Louis Berthollet , Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau , and Antoine Francois Fourcroy , began to see the utility of his notions . Lavoisier 's ideas became known as the theory of the French chemists . Lavoisier , however , said " It is mine . " ' Claude Louis Berthollet Though born to French nobility Berthollet did not have the financial advantages of Lavoisier . He chose the profession of physician and studied chemistry in connection with his studies in medicine . Perhaps through family connections he made the acquaintance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king 's service , with a passion for the theater , music , and a certain Marquise de Montesson . The duke recommended Berthollet as private physician to Madame de Montesson , and this position provided Berthollet with the support to marry and the leisure time to do chemical experiments in the duke 's personal laboratory . Berthollet repeated experiments of Lavoisier , Priestley , and Scheele , and that work won him election to the Academy of Sciences . He then worked with Fourcroy , de Morveau , and the Lavoisiers on the promotion and dissemination of Lavoisier 's new system of chemistry . Bernard Guyton de Morveau A lawyer from a bourgeois family , Bernard Guyton added de Morveau to his name to designate family property . Following the course of politics during the French revolution , he became Guyton-Morveau , then Guyton , then Guyton-Morveau again . He taught himself chemistry and equipped a laboratory in his house . He chose as a personal project to verify that in fact every metal gained weight on heating in air . No one had so carefully and systematically approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth . He based his original explanation for the phenomenon on the levitation powers of phlogiston , but Lavoisier convinced him that it was caused by the absorption of part of the air . De Morveau became a lecturer in chemistry at the Dijon Academy . Like Marie Lavoisier , de Morveau had a talent for languages and // translated a number of books and papers , working with the wife of an associate at the Dijon academy , Claudine Picardet ( he and Picardet later married after the death of her husband ) . His understanding of languages also manifested itself in his frustration with the current chemical nomenclature . Based on appearance ( oil of vitriol , butter of antimony ) , or a person ( Glauber 's salt ) , or a place ( Epsom salt ) , names of chemicals rarely described their composition or chemical behavior . He proposed some reforms , then worked with Berthollet , Lavoisier , and Fourcroy to develop a systematic method of nomenclature . Antoine Francois Fourcroy The youngest of the group of Lavoisier 's close associates was Fourcroy . Fourcroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the working class . Fourcroy 's father was an apothecary , and his mother died when he was seven . Never described as a particularly brilliant student , Fourcroy was very hard working , and when the secretary of the Royal Society of Medicine met this earnest young man , he managed to have Fourcroy 's medical education sponsored by the Society of Medicine . Fourcroy never practiced medicine , but finding he had a talent for chemistry and teaching , he began lecturing in the private laboratory of Bucquet . He eventually became professor of chemistry at the Jardin du Roi , and when Fourcroy married , he was able to use part of his wife 's dowry to set up a private laboratory where he gave private instruction in chemistry . Reportedly an excellent teacher , Fourcroy 's approach to research seems a bit mundane . The body of work that this hard-working chemist was able to accomplish is impressive , but there are few remarkable insights . He was important however for his association with , and support of , Lavoisier . This came about through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first applied to the Academy of Sciences in his early twenties , he did not succeed until he was in his thirties . When he was admitted , he became predictably one of the hardest workers . Aside from assignments from the Academy of Sciences , Fourcroy pursed his own research interests , which reflected his previous training in medicine . Interested in changes that take place in matter during putrefaction , he took advantage of the opportunity to examine // 1000 corpses exhumed from the Cemetery of the Innocents . He carefully described the effect of heat , air , water , alcohol , acids , alkalis , and other solvents on decayed material . Fourcroy also investigated the effect of injecting putrefied blood into animals ( there was a theory at the time that scurvy was caused by blood putrefying in the veins ) , but his subjects did not survive to develop symptoms . Fourcroy and an associate , Vauquelin ( whose story more rightly belongs in the next chapter , and that is where we have placed it ) also examined chemically the urine of such diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fourcroy was not particularly political ( although it was an age that forced politics on everyone ) , but he favored reforms proposed by the revolution . After the revolution had begun , he taught revolutionary courses ( short intensive courses on the manufacture of niter , gunpowder , and cannon , etc. ) and helped write instructions intended to guide the general public in the production of such practical items as soap . In another support of the revolutionary effort , he developed a process to separate copper from the copper ? tin alloy of church bells . In addition to his voluminous work , Fourcroy was also a voluminous writer . Though described as verbose his writings were accurate and understandable . Several women attended his lectures ( including Marie Roland , destined to meet the guillotine ) , and Fourcroy wrote some works directed specifically to this audience . He also wrote a textbook , Elements of Natural History and Chemistry , the second edition of which presented both the phlogiston and oxygen theories . When Fourcroy presented the second edition to the Academy of Sciences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps because Lavoisier was aware of how important the full endorsement of such an influential person in French chemical education would be , the publication of the book was held up until Fourcroy became convinced of the validity of Lavoisier 's theory . It happened at about the same time as the conversion of Berthollet . Nomenclature These three chemists ? de Morveau , Berthollet , and Fourcroy ? then joined the Lavoisiers in establishing Lavoisier 's theory . One major step in this direction was the proposal and publication of a new system of // nomenclature that agreed with the theory . The new system ( which is still in use ) named compounds according to elements they contained and their functionality . For instance a compound of a metal with a nonmetal had the suffix ide ( for example tin oxide ) ; acids were named for their nonoxygen component ( for example sulfuric acid ) . Salts of acids had different suffixes to distinguish them from acids ( for example a salt of sulfuric acid was a sulfate ) . Acids with the same nonoxygen component but different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed from sulfur with less oxygen was called sulfurous acid , and the salt of this acid was a sulfite ) . Significantly the nomenclature text included tables of such elements as oxygen , nitrogen , hydrogen , carbon , sulfur , and phosphorus ( Lavoisier also listed light and caloric , which he postulated to be the element of heat ) , a list of organic radicals , and a list of compounds of alkaline earths and alkali metals . In other efforts to disseminate their views Lavoisier , Berthollet , Fourcroy , de Morveau , and others established a new journal , Annales de Chimie , and Lavoisier published his important work , Traite elementaire de chimie . In it he listed 33 elements and proposed the term " gas " for materials that he and others had been calling " airs . " He included his theory of heat and light as elements ? a decided weakness in the system ? but his explanation of calcination , combustion , and reduction in terms of oxygen rather than phlogiston had such a ring of truth that the system had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced . Scheele died believing in the truth of phlogiston , and Cavendish believed that Lavoisier 's explanations worked about as well as phlogiston and turned to studies in physics . The irascible Priestley wrote two of his last publications in defense of phlogiston , but the newer generation of chemists were generally convinced . Elizabeth Fulhame , a chemist in the newly formed United States , published an Essay on Combustion in 1794 that accepted Lavoisier 's nomenclature . The Lavoisiers , with a rather dramatic touch , staged a celebration in which Marie , dressed as a priestess , burned on an altar the writings of Stahl and Becher . But then many things were being burned in those days . The Traite elementaire de chimie was published in 1789 , the first year of the French Revolution . // The momentum of the revolution gathered rapidly . Marie Antoinette appealed to the Austrian monarchy for intervention . The fear of foreign invasion enabled more zealous revolutionaries to gain control of the Legislative Assembly . Recruits from Marseilles brought to Paris the marching song known as the Marseillaise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . Refractory priests and counterrevolutionaries were dragged out of prison , tried , and executed . Instead of enacting the constitution and disbanding as originally planned , the National Assembly extended its life from year to year , assigning its executive powers to a group known as the Committee of Public Safety . The role of the committee was to control anarchy and counterrevolution so that the nation 's resources could be concentrated on the international war . The committee proceeded to carry out its work so enthusiastically that this period became known as the Reign of Terror . The Academy of Sciences in this phase of the revolution was seen more and more as the bastion of the elite and privileged . Moreover Lavoisier , as a member of one of the tax-collecting firms , was a special target for such militants as Maxirnilien Robespierre and Jean Marat , a disgruntled would-be member of the Academy of Sciences whose publication on the element of fire had earned disparaging comments from Lavoisier . Although Lavoisier was a member of the important committee on weights and measures formed for the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had greatly improved the quality of the gunpowder used by revolutionary armies , he was arrested and imprisoned . Pluvenet , an obscure druggist who sold chemicals to Lavoisier , got the prosecutor to agree to move Lavoisier to a better prison if Marie Lavoisier would make the request in person . She went to the appointment , but apparently every bit as arrogant as her husband , she did not plead but used the opportunity to heap abuse on the people who had arrested her husband . Lavoisier was not transferred , and on the morning of May 8 , 1794 , he was tried . Later that day he followed his father-in-law to the guillotine . There has been continued debate in history as to why Lavoisier 's associates , Fourcroy and de Morveau , respected leaders in the revolutionary movement , did not rise to Lavoisier 's defense . Apparently there is some evidence that a day or two before the execution , Fourcroy did go to a meeting of the Committee of Public Safety and spoke in Uvoisier 's defense . Lazare Carnot ( whose son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourcroy 's plea was met with stony silence by Robespierre . Fourcroy must have reasoned that his hands were tied ? in the figurative sense ? and if he pursued his protest , the sense could become literal . " Of the group around him though , Lavoisier suffered the worst . ) Fourcroy , always philosophically in support of the revolution , after Marat 's assassination , became an active supporter of the revolution . He survived the Terror and even participated in the regime of Napoleon . He had long been in love with a married cousin , and when her husband died , he divorced his wife and married the cousin . From 1800 he resided in the Museum of Natural History and with his associate , Vauquelin , spent productive years plodding along with his accumulation of data . Fourcroy was ultimately disappointed in his ambitions , not achieving the academic rank to which he aspired ( a decision based on politics rather than qualifications ) , and his health failed . He died at the age of 54 , probably from a stroke . De Morveau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis XVI . In fact he served as president of the first Committee of Public Safety , but he was too moderate by some standards and was replaced . Away fighting the Austrians at the time of Lavoisier 's trial ( de Morveau helped to orgaAlize the first military air force in the form of crew-carrying reconnaissance balloons ) , he may not have known of Lavoisier 's arrest until too late , or had he known he may not have been able to return in time to protest . After the Terror his scientific career , like Fourcroy 's , continued to prosper . De Morveau also worked well with Napoleon and under Napoleon was administrator of the mints , retiring finally only after Waterloo . Even when the Bourbon monarchy was restored and many of those responsible for the execution of Louis XVI were exiled , de Morveau was allowed to remain in France where he died 6 months later . Perhaps the last and the most loyal of the entourage surrounding Lavoisier , Marie Lavoisier was to survive her husband by 42 years , living to be nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Terror , she was held only briefly , and most of the family 's // confiscated possessions were returned to her after her husband 's execution . Shortly after Lavoisier 's death , Marie edited and published a collection of his scientific work . In this she was initially assisted by Armand Seguin , who had been Lavoisier 's assistant near the time of his demise . But the collaboration between Seguin and Marie Lavoisier did not continue long . Seguin hesitated to commit his name to a document denouncing Lavoisier 's still politically active executioners , and he believed he should be given credit for work Marie Lavoisier did not believe he deserved . Though it can not be doubted that he put much of his person into his researches ( part of Lavoisier 's experiments on respiration included enclosing Seguin in a varnished silk bag with a brass face mask so that he breathed oxygen from a reservoir and the exhaled products could be collected ) , there is some question as to how much of the interpretation of results was his . Marie Lavoisier remarried some 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , Count Rumford , figures prominently in chemical history in the 1800s . However the marriage was not a happy one . One story has her ordering her husband out of their house , and another has her pouring boiling water over his favorite flowers . Marie insisted on keeping the Lavoisier name , calling herself Countess Lavoisier of Rumford , and reportedly she became increasingly arrogant with time . The marriage lasted only 4 years . But then all things change with time , including revolutions . Robespierre met his fate on the guillotine , and the young army officer , Napoleon , decided that the fight for freedom could be furthered by conscription , national war , and a permanent dictatorship with himself at the head . But though perverted in the end , the revolution in France shook the foundations of national monarchies and left a Europe never to be the same , just as Lavoisier 's revolution broke the stranglehold of Aristotle on European thought , so that chemistry would never be the same ? Lavoisier managed this feat because he was exceptionally brilliant but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another less revolutionary age , he might not have felt free to question traditional assumptions as he did . Lavoisier 's success may have had another more subtle source . Lavoisier was not a humble man : He was at times annoyingly arrogant , but then he was born to the privileged class , wealthy nearly to // the point of independence , and married to a beautiful , devoted wife , so there was little in his life to convince him he should be otherwise . This may have been a source of his strength ; maybe Lavoisier succeeded because he was just arrogant enough to put his ideas up against those of Aristotle . But the ideas of Aristotle had served their purpose as a starting place for chemical theory , and as an early chemical theory with an empirical foundation , phlogiston served chemistry well , too . It provided a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental results , and it seemed to have some predictive powers ( witness Scheele 's prediction of fire-air , which he subsequently isolated ) . In fact the problem was that it worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanations . Lavoisier was not the first to challenge phlogiston , nor the first to propose conservation of mass , nor the first to discover oxygen , but he did have the insight to realize that oxygen could be used to defeat phlogiston finally and firmly . Once this crack in the Aristotelian edifice had been found , it quickly crumbled , and real theoretical progress began . The next generation of chemists started discovering new elements at an amazing rate , and with hardly a backward glance at the first famous four : earth , water , air , and fire .
