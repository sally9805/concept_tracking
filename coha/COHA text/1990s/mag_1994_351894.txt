Investigator Terry Grosz is screening a snuff film . The quality is poor , but the action is gruesomely clear : a group of hunters , accompanied by Doberman pinschers , is stalking a bear and her cub in the New Hampshire woods . The mother dies relatively quickly from her wounds ; her cub is less lucky . " Get her with this ! " shouts a man , and pulls out a crossbow . Suddenly the cub squeals ; imbedded in its skull , as if in some ghastly Saturday-morning cartoon , is an arrow . The hunter takes his time reloading . Finally , with his second shot , the bear falls to the ground , where the dogs set upon it . The hunters cheer ; then one of them cuts open the cub 's back , reaches into its body and pulls out the goal of all the butchery : the bear 's gallbladder . He grins and holds up the bloody organ as if it were worth its weight in gold . Which it is . <P> The video , taken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was later used to put the hunter in jail . Grosz , a 6-ft. 5-in. bear of a man who is an assistant regional director for law enforcement for the Fish and Wildlife Service , has seen the footage dozens of times in this Lakewood , Colorado , viewing room , yet he can not control his sorrow , or his anger . His eyes still damp , he asks , " Did you see that ? How they were killing the bears right in front of the camera ? Those bastards . . . " <P> Brown bears . Bighorn sheep . Elk . But also gray-banded king snakes . Ducks . Spiders . Butterflies . Of all God 's creatures , great and small , there are apparently few that enterprising Americans are unwilling to slaughter or kidnap in the country 's national parks . Poaching in the parks has been a problem since they were founded in the 19th century , but never like this , says Grosz , echoing colleagues across the U.S. " I 've been in the business for 30 years , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 're taking everything . " Wildlife-enforcement officials estimate that there are 3,000 American black bears taken illegally every year . <P> The very sites designated for wildlife 's preservation are becoming its abattoir , almost as if someone had let a serial killer into Noah 's ark . Poachers haunt nearly half of America 's 366 park areas , supplying animal parts to illegal traffickers who operate in at least 17 states . They supply bear paws as culinary delicacies and bear gallbladders as medicinal ingredients . Rare butterflies are netted for collectors around the world . Deer are decapitated to decorate homes . The illegal killing of animals is a $200 million-a-year business , with as much as $100 million of that amount for medicinal purposes . The victims include not only the big carnivores and grazers , but also more than 100 other species , 20 of which could become extinct sometime in the next century if their depletion continues at the current pace , the Park Service warns . Four of them  --  the hawksbill sea turtle , brown pelican , peregrine falcon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember seeing salmon so damn thick in the river you could have walked on them , " Grosz says . " Now they 're scarce . And we 're killing 5,000 different kinds of birds every year . "
