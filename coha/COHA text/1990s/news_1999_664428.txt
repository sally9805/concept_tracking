<p> Mike Tyson remembers , even if others do n't . <p> When you 're 20 and the youngest heavyweight champion ever , you do n't easily forget . <p> It was Nov. 22 , 1986 , and the WBC belt Tyson had won by knocking out Trevor Berbick only hours before was proudly displayed around his waist as he walked around the Las Vegas Hilton lobby . <p> He wore the belt to bed that night and paraded through the hotel with it again the next day . It took him two days before he could bring himself to take the belt off . <p> " I just wanted the world to say , ' Look at me , " ' Tyson recalled . <p> Look they did , with a mixture of curiosity and awe at the new , ferocious champion with the squeaky voice . <p> And they 've been looking ever since , through good times and bad . They 've watched through multimillion-dollar fights and a prison sentence for rape , followed by a comeback and a biting that marked one of boxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the stage once again , fighting for the first time since he chewed off a chunk of Evander Holyfield 's ear on June 28 , 1997 . <p> And again , people will be there to look , as if they were stopping to check out a car wreck . <p> They will see a destructive Tyson or a Tyson who self-destructs . In the nearly 13 years since he knocked out Berbick , they have seen both . <p> Mostly , though , they will be there to see Tyson because they ca n't bring themselves to stop watching him . <p> " People think I 'm either a superstar or a freak , " he said . " I do n't blame them . I can definitely relate to that myself . " <p> Nearly 19 months after he was banned by Nevada boxing officials for biting Holyfield , Tyson returns to the ring at the MGM Grand hotel-casino for a scheduled 10-round fight against Francois Botha of South Africa . <p> Tyson 's second comeback in less than four years will earn him some $ 20 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to unify the heavyweight titles two months later against Lennox Lewis . <p> The payday - which will allow the 32-year-old Tyson to settle a $ 13 million IRS lien - is evidence enough that he still has his magnetic draw . <p> " He 's bigger than ever , it 's just unbelievable , " said Tyson 's new manager , Shelly Finkel . " He does the unpredictable and people just want to see him . I also think a lot of people see him as being victimized . " <p> The huge money Tyson is earning for the 10-round bout is even more remarkable considering he has lost his last two fights , both to Holyfield , and many in boxing believe he has not been the same fighter since James " Buster " Douglas beat him a decade ago in Japan . <p> But Tyson continues to fascinate the public , even those who normally would n't give boxing a second look . TV executives expect nearly 1 million homes to buy the pay-per-view fight with Botha at a cost of about $ 45 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport , for better or ill , " said Jay Larkin , executive producer for Showtime , which will televise the fight . " He probably commands more focus and attention than any fighter in history . " <p> Tyson 's allure was evident recently at his Phoenix training camp , where a few dozen people gathered to try to get autographs and pictures as the fighter pulled into the crumbling gym in a shiny new purple Rolls Royce . <p> They waited outside while Tyson trained , then were allowed inside where he joked with them , signed autographs and had his picture taken with everyone who wanted one . <p> Freed from some of the entourage he assembled under promoter Don King , Tyson has new management and , seemingly , a new attitude . He spent time talking to teen-age prisoners one day and handed out free turkeys another , drawing criticism that he was just looking for publicity . <p> He even found some sympathy among people who thought he was treated unfairly after biting Holyfield . <p> " Ordinary people in the street relate to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' You were in a fight , man . You had to do what you had to do . ' People in boxing do n't relate to that . They look at it a whole lot different . " <p> Nevada boxing authorities looked at it so differently that they made Tyson go through five days of psychiatric exams in a Boston hospital before finally voting in October to allow him to return to the sport . <p> Doctors testified that Tyson suffers from low self esteem and was often depressed , but that he was unlikely to snap again in the ring . <p> Those close to Tyson said he felt humiliated by the tests - and one doctor said he was briefly threatened by the former champ . But Tyson said being allowed to fight again made it all worthwhile . <p> " How could I really be embarrassed going through that stuff ? " he said . " I should be happy because I did . Imagine if I did n't go through it . Where would I be now ? I would n't be fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fighting again is remarkable enough considering the outcry after the Holyfield fight . He was n't allowed to reapply for a license for a year after it was revoked in July 1997 , and Tyson went through one hearing in New Jersey and two in Las Vegas before getting his license back . <p> He still faces a possible jail sentence stemming from a Maryland traffic accident involving his wife . He pleaded no contest to assaulting two men and will be sentenced Feb. 5 . Indiana authorities could send him back to jail if they decide he violated parole from his 1992 rape conviction . <p> But , after more than a year and a half without doing the thing he loves best , Tyson at least has his occupation back . <p> " The things that bother me are n't fighting , but my personal life , " Tyson said . " Fighting is natural to me . It 's the other things in life I have problems with . Every day , I 'm always trying to walk that fine line . " <p> Assuming he beats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former IBF heavyweight champion - Tyson wants to fight every three months or so . <p> A third fight with Holyfield that would be boxing 's richest ever is tentatively penciled in for late in the year , possibly in November . That , of course , depends on whether Holyfield beats Lewis and Tyson wins his comeback fights . <p> " I would fight that fight like a Mexican fighter , " Tyson said . " If they fight a guy and get beaten , the next time they fight , they fight like they had knocked the guy out and not the other way around . That 's the way I 'm thinking . " <p> The heavyweight title that seemed to come so easily at 20 , though , is the ultimate goal for a fighter who a dozen years later finds time is not on his side . <p> " Everybody knows I want the championship back , " Tyson said . " But I need to do it one fight at a time . "
