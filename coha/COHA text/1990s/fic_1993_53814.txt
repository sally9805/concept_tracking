AMIR 'S FAMILY got robbed the day he turned ten . They lived in a first-floor apartment off Fifth Avenue , where his mother hid jewelry and his father kept cash , all of which was gone when the three of them returned from the weekend . <p> Their weekend house looked out on a golf course . Amir played there every week , came back to school Monday morning with brown , leathery forearms and blisters on his hands . <p> He was my best friend . He tried to teach me golf , how to plant my feet and drive the ball , how to choose the right putter . " Weight balanced , " he said . " Head straight . " School was out , and we were on the Central Park baseball fields practicing my swing . Amir placed golf balls on the ground in front of me . " Easy now , " he said . I swung smoothly , but the ball skidded off my club , bouncing across the infield and out into the grass . " Jake , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He could hit the ball far ; he said someday he 'd drive it clear across the park and onto the West Side where I lived with my parents . <p> For years I wanted to visit his weekend home . I wanted to play golf at his country club , but his parents were n't Orthodox , and drove to Westchester on Friday nights when I had to be home because of the Sabbath . <p> Amir was quietly confident , broad for his age ; his dark blond bangs matched his eyebrows . He humored me when I joked about his handicap ( " Has it gone down ? " I asked him all through high school . " Is n't it about time it went down ? " ) , but on the day his parents discovered the robbery his voice grew serious , and I felt the fear as he spoke , the queasy , violated sensation of knowing a stranger has been in your room . <p> His family moved after that to a huge high-rise on York Avenue with a twenty-four-hour doorman and police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movers pack . We took his golf shoes , which he 'd gotten for his birthday , and put them in the truck . We lined a box with tissue paper and placed his trophies inside . We opened Amir 's drawers , and I watched him sort his papers , trying to decide what to keep . We were children , both of us , but I understood what it meant to move , the keeping and discarding , the way the little decisions about what we take with us help define our lives . <p> He died his senior year of college . I spoke at the funeral . I 'd stayed up late the night before to write the eulogy , but I remember less about the synagogue service than about afterward : the real afterward , when the seven-day mourning period was over and everyone went home . I came down from Rhode Island and visited his parents . They 'd found pictures of Amir and me in his file cabinet and wanted me to have them . They 'd left everything else untouched . The bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's desk . I saw two parents , sedated and unshowered , a mother and father who 'd buried their child . And I saw Amir , a teenage golfer in front of his mirror , practicing his swing , arms taut and perfect . <p> We went to synagogue every Saturday morning , my father , mother , and I ; we walked along the city blocks because we were n't allowed to drive on the Sabbath . We did n't write or watch television , we did n't do any work at all , and on Saturday afternoons my parents took a nap , because the Sabbath was the day of rest and both of them were tired . <p> I tried to nap too . I 'd lie in bed and close my eyes and ask God to help me sleep . I 'd hear my father snoring down the hall . I 'd stare at the ceiling , at the shadows on the walls , and I 'd wait . <p> I liked the Sabbath . I liked the smells of Friday night  --  roasted chicken on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked the Hebrew songs . I liked the evening prayer service , my father and I swaying , bowing to the Sabbath Queen , and though I knew the Sabbath had no flesh , was not a queen at all , I imagined her as real , dark-haired and beautiful like the queens from the Bible , coming to visit us every Friday as the sun began to set . <p> I did n't have breakfast on Saturday mornings . It was wrong to eat before services , though not exactly prohibited . The reasons were unclear to me , but I knew my grandfather had written an article against eating before prayer services , and that was enough for me . <p> He was in his eighties then , a famous rabbi on the Lower East Side . He did n't speak English , though he 'd been in the United States forty five years . My father and I visited him every Sunday morning . We walked past pickle stands and kosher butchers . My father had grown up on these streets , played handball against the wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish boys using a ball he 'd caught one Sunday afternoon in the Yankee Stadium bleachers . <p> Clustered along side streets were religious shops , where you could buy mezuzahs and candlesticks and order phylacteries . Before breakfast I 'd watch my father wrap the phylacteries around his arm , over and under his fingers , spelling out God 's name ; afterward , over cereal , I 'd watch him again , resting his left arm on the kitchen counter , the mark of the leather straps still imprinted on his skin . <p> Amir and I went to a Jewish day school on the Upper East Side where boys and girls were taught Bible and Hebrew along with general studies . Prayers were held in the social hall every morning , and the older boys , who 'd been bar mitzvahed , wrapped the phylacteries around their arms as my father did . They had their own lockers , stored their phylacteries inside , and after school Amir and I stood by the elevators and watched them . They wore slacks and penny loafers ; personalized yarmulkes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their heads . <p> " The phylacteries stop your blood pressure , " said Amir . <p> " No they do n't , " I answered . <p> He leaned against the wall . " Does your father put them on every day ? " <p> I nodded . <p> " How long do the marks stay there ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I said . " Till the afternoon , I guess . They 're gone when I come home from school . " <p> We waited for the elevator but did n't get in . It was 1973 and we were ten years old , too young to have girlfriends but old enough to want them , too young for a locker or phylacteries . <p> We met when we were five . We were kindergartners learning two alphabets  --  left to right and right to left  --  sitting next to each other in the front of the classroom because our last names began with A. <p> Amir 's mother was Israeli , so Amir spoke Hebrew with a funny accent . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guttural , which made the rest of us laugh . Our teacher , Morah Moscowitz , asked us to be quiet . <p> " It 's authentic , " Amir told me . " That 's what Morah Moscowitz said . " <p> For a long time I wanted to be like Amir . I wanted to live on the East Side and have a country house . I wanted to play golf . I wanted to have blond hair and a mother who dressed in fur . I wanted all these things simply because he had them , so I tried chow mein when he did , even though its smell made me gag and I could n't force it down . And when we were in fifth grade and he got glasses , I wanted them so much I told my mother my eyesight was blurry and had her take me to the optometrist . I sat in the doctor 's darkened office and stared at the chart on the wall across from me . I closed one eye and then the other . I blinked and I squinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't lying to the doctor , telling him letters I knew were wrong . <p> Later I realized Amir wanted to be like me  --  that when he became kosher in high school he was doing what I did : sitting in a restaurant and figuring out what he could and could n't eat . He had his parents buy him food from a kosher butcher . He stopped eating lobster and shrimp . He did n't use separate dishes , did n't wait between eating meat and milk , but he was kosher for Amir , and that was enough to make me happy . <p> At school , my teachers spoke reverentially of my grandfather , about his knowledge of Talmud , about rabbis and scholars who came from all over the world to hear him speak about Jewish law . My father , the principal said , was an eminent historian . I sat in the school office and the principal just stared . I could see what he was thinking : that I was next , the only child , and was supposed to carry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming a mathematician . My father had studied math in college , and had planned to go to graduate school in mathematics before he changed his mind and became a historian . He was five when his family arrived from Russia , a shy boy who refused to talk to immigration officials . <p> " Is he mute ? " asked the interpreter . " We ca n't admit mutes into this country . " <p> My grandfather coaxed him in Yiddish , but still my father would n't speak . " What 's fifteen minus six ? " my grandfather asked . <p> " Nine , " said my father , and the family was let in . <p> I changed my mind about math . I was going to be a rabbi , like my grandfather . He lived on the second floor of a huge apartment building where everyone , it seemed , was Jewish . He was wrinkled and walked slowly and was almost completely blind , but every day he went to his office , a small room in the back of a synagogue where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . <p> He walked to work , guided by Mr. Hamburger , an elderly Jewish man who took care of my grandfather and cooked his meals . I played with Mr. Hamburger on Sunday mornings while my father and grandfather studied in the other room . <p> " How many fingers do I have ? " asked Mr. Hamburger . He held up both his hands . <p> " Ten . " <p> " Eleven , " he said and began to count , going backwards , left hand first , " ten , nine , eight , seven , six , " then pointing to his right hand- " plus five makes eleven . " <p> At home , I did the calculations on a piece of paper . I knew ten was right but could n't explain why , could n't figure out how Mr. Hamburger had fooled me . <p> I stopped playing with him . His hands were callused and he cackled when he spoke . There was a stench in the apartment , the sweet rancid smell of fish and overripe fruit which I later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just smelled like Mr. Hamburger , who tried to keep me in the kitchen while my father and grandfather studied inside . <p> They studied Talmud , though my grandfather was no longer able to read . He knew the Talmud by heart . At school we 'd been told about the rabbis of Eastern Europe , old men with photographic memories who could put a pin through a book of the Talmud and name every letter the pin passed through . <p> " Can zayde do that ? " I asked my father . <p> " He does n't play games , " my father answered . <p> My grandfather blessed me every Sunday before my father and I left . He had a long white beard and frail hands and his lips felt soft against my head as he bent over to kiss me . He spoke in Hebrew , asked God to watch over me like Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . I stood tall in front of him and concentrated , knowing his blessing was important , that it would protect me from something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my defenses and make me wise . <p> Amir came along to visit him once . We were in the third grade . We took the 1 Train downtown to 59th Street , where we stood on the staircase , halfway between two floors , waiting to see whether the D or A would come first . <p> My father and I did this every week . We stayed on the staircase and listened for the engine . Then we ran . I followed behind him , scared I would n't catch up  --  that the train would leave without me. with him already inside  --  but also excited : the two of us running together , the three of us now , and that this was a bond between us : Amir , my father , and I running for the train , jumping into the car as the doors began to close . <p> At my grandfather 's apartment , Amir and I sat in the kitchen and whispered . We could hear my father and grandfather studying , talking Yiddish in the room next door . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We walked down the hallway to where my father and grandfather sat . It was a dining room , really , but it seemed more like a study : religious books lined the walls ; tattered volumes of commentary were piled high on the table and on the desk by the window looking onto Grand Street . <p> " Does he ever shave his beard ? " Amir asked . <p> " Sometimes he trims it . " <p> " Can I talk to him ? " <p> " He does n't speak English , " I said . " I can speak to him in Hebrew . " Amir stepped forward and stopped , a few feet from my grandfather . " Shalom , " he said , but nothing more , and for a few moments he stood staring at my grandfather , and at the dense pages of Aramaic text spread out on the plastic tablecloth . <p> My grandfather blessed us both that day . We stood before him and listened to his voice crack , felt his hands resting on our heads . When he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the kitchen , we sat with Mr. Hamburger . Amir held the Talmud in his lap . Its binding was frayed , and Amir ran his pinky along the cover , tracing out the words of the title . I saw the volume the next month , standing on Amir 's bookshelf , and again nine years later as we got ready to leave for college . Amir was packing his duffel bag ; he wrapped my grandfather 's Talmud inside a pillowcase , cushioned it with his clothes . <p> It was the only time they met , but after that visit , Amir would ask about my grandfather ( " Does he ever watch TV ? " " Is it hard to be a rabbi in Russia ? " ) . That day , on the subway ride home , he told me he wanted to become religious : when he was older and had his own family he 'd try to keep the Sabbath and put on phylacteries ; he 'd find someone to teach him Yiddish . <p> I was a child . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believed at the same time I 'd never learn it . I understood certain things . I knew I 'd grow up , that I 'd make a life of my own , but I did n't imagine I 'd stop being religious . I saw my future in narrow terms : I 'd be older but the same , a bigger version of the boy I was , living on the Upper West Side , with a wife like my mother and an apartment overlooking the Hudson , where the sun set purple and where , on Friday nights , you could look out at the water and see the reflection of Sabbath candles in the windows facing west . <p> I 'd lie in bed at night and wonder about my grandfather : what it was like to be old and arthritic and not able to see , and why God had blinded someone so righteous . <p> He had glaucoma , my father said . <p> My father drew an eye and showed me all the parts . He explained what glaucoma was . He understood thermodynamics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the capitals of the fifty states and of all the member countries of the United Nations . He was obsessed with facts , and I remember knowing , without being told , that my grandfather had glaucoma because he did n't understand the human eye , that knowledge was like a talisman and could protect us . <p> " Zayde 's old , " my mother said . <p> " Some people are born blind , " I answered . <p> I knew a student in the grade below me who came to school with a seeing-eye dog , and whose classmates took turns guiding him around the building and talking to him on the sidelines during Phys . Ed . On Broadway I 'd seen children in wheelchairs , deformed kids whose heads angled to the sides and whose legs were spindly and contorted . I 'd read in the supermarket checkout line about people who got reincarnated : how one woman had been a Spanish princess and another a cow in ancient Egypt . <p> " What if I get reincarnated , " I asked my mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You wo n't , " she answered . She was making plum pie , slicing the plums and pitting them , then lining the slices inside a hollow pastry shell . " It does n't work that way . " <p> She sat with my father and me after lunch on Saturdays as we studied Jewish ethics . She was from an immigrant Jewish family herself , though her parents were n't Orthodox and had sent her to a progressive private school with no walls between the classrooms . There she learned about Norman Thomas and the U.S. steel strikes and campaigned after class for Adlai Stevenson . There was no religion in her home , although her parents had a Christmas tree , which they called a bush . They never went to synagogue , but on Yom Kippur her father fasted , leaving work early and walking by the East River so he could be alone and think about his soul . <p> Now she 'd begun to study Hebrew at the YMHA , where she learned phrases I did n't know , words like " taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you visited Israel . <p> " Do you know what sabon means ? " she asked . <p> " No , " I said . <p> " Soap . " <p> I quizzed Amir at school the next week . <p> " You did n't know sabon ? " he said . <p> I was good at biblical Hebrew , the Hebrew of the synagogue , hummed more than spoken , a plaintive mumble my father used as he read from Ethics of the Fathers after lunch on Saturdays . Ayn b'yadaynu lo mi'shalvat ha'risha'im vi'af lo m'yisooray ha'tsadikim . He translated for my mother . It is not in our hands to understand either the peace of the wicked or the misfortunes of the righteous . <p> We 'd learned about the Holocaust in school . Our teacher asked us to imagine how much space we could fill with six million bottlecaps . <p> " The classroom , " said one girl . <p> " The whole school , " said another . <p> I thought about the boy whose picture was on the wall of our school auditorium . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head ; he was about to be shot by the S.S. I thought about the Cambodian girl I 'd seen on television , emaciated and dirty , and the movie actor asking us to adopt her . I thought about the Soviet Jews , who were n't allowed to study Torah and who had to have phylacteries smuggled to them . I thought about my father , and what would have happened if he had n't answered that math question at Ellis Island , if he had n't spoken at all and the whole family had been sent back to Russia . I would n't have been born . I pictured myself , me but not me , a Russian boy with a different mother , forced to eat borscht like my father still did , the beets and sour cream mixed together . <p> I thanked God for my good luck . Every morning I prayed and thanked Him , but I did n't know why I deserved what I had . I did n't talk about luck with my father . I was beginning to realize there were questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself , accepting what he told me , and what I learned in school : that God was everywhere , that He was inside me and outside me , bodiless and omnipresent , and that I simply had to follow His will : keep kosher and go to synagogue and give a tenth of my money to charity , and become bar mitzvahed and put on phylacteries every weekday and visit Israel and trust in Him to protect me and my family from horrible disfiguring diseases  --  from my grandfather 's blindness and from what had happened to those kids in wheelchairs whom I watched getting pushed along Broadway . <p> Afternoons we had gym at the YMHA , five blocks north of school . Amir would n't jaywalk , even when no cars were in sight , so I stood with him on the corner while the other kids passed us by . They rushed to the gym , poking fun at Amir , and at me for indulging him  --  but with respect , it seemed ; they understood Amir stuck to his principles , even if those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always , an athletic boy starting to grow handsome , the one the girls would whisper about at bar mitzvahs . It was the mid-1970s and we danced mostly in groups , wore wide shirt lapels and velvet jackets , doing the hustle in hotel ballrooms . At the end of the evening the bar mitzvah boy came out on the floor , and we picked him up in a chair and carried him around the room until our arms shook and we started to grow dizzy and our yarmulkes had fallen from our heads . Then the band played a last song , a slow number . The adults streamed onto the dance floor while we went back to our tables , twelve- and thirteen-year-olds fiddling with pastry wrappers , with melted candle wax dripping to the tablecloth , wanting to slow dance but afraid to ask . <p> There was a girl I liked : dark-skinned with wavy brown hair , a tiny gap between her two front teeth . Her name was Melanie . I danced with her once at a bar mitzvah , to a fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , a large group dancing in a cluster , so it was hard to tell who was really with whom . But toward the end of the song Melanie took my hand , and for the moment it was clear we were together . <p> Nothing came of it . She had a crush on Amir , but he seemed not to notice her . <p> " Ask her out , " I told him . . <p> " She likes you . " <p> " No she does n't . She likes you . " <p> A couple of years later , in ninth grade , Melanie and I became friends , and she told me Amir had talked to her after that party . <p> " I liked him a lot , " she said . " I tried to hold his hand once , but he pulled away . All he 'd talk about was you . " <p> " What did he say ? " <p> " Good things . He told me someday I 'd want to marry you . " <p> The following year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig and his family lived on Long Island , in a two-story brick home surrounded by rose bushes . His father owned a linen factory in lower Manhattan where Puerto Rican workers shipped sheets and towels across the country to department-store chains . On his friends ' birthdays Craig brought gifts from his father 's factory , towels and terrycloth robes with initials embroidered on them . <p> " I like him , " said Amir . " He makes me laugh . " <p> " He 's a snob , " I said . <p> Craig had curly black hair and pennies in his loafers . His teeth were straight and white , and his forehead furrowed when he smiled . Sometimes I could hear him in the back of the classroom whispering with Amir while the teacher was n't looking . <p> " His family owns a tennis court , " said Amir . <p> They owned two , in fact , one clay and one hard-surface , and on Sundays Craig and Amir played singles , then lay out in the sun and drank sodas from a cooler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out with a pair of twins from the class below us . Their names were Suzanne and Suzette , two girls with oval green eyes who lived with their parents in Greenwich Village . <p> " That 's stupid , " I said . <p> " What is ? " <p> " Identical twins named Suzanne and Suzette . " <p> " No it 's not , " said Amir . We were in his living room , on the twenty-seventh floor . It occurred to me then how different it felt , looking down from a high-rise defended by guards . I remembered when we were younger , playing on his quiet side street . We used to wrestle by the television when his parents had gone out , our knees getting burnt against the carpet . " I remember the day you got robbed , " I said . <p> " Me too . " <p> " I even remember your old phone number . " <p> " 629-5916 , " said Amir . " That was seven years ago . " <p> " In a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . " <p> " I know , " he said . <p> " Where does Craig want to go ? " <p> " I 'm not sure . Maybe he 'll come with me to California . " <p> He lay on the couch . His head was propped against the leather armrest , and in the shadows cast through the open venetian blinds I could see he was starting to grow hair on his face . " What 's so great about Craig ? " I said . " I make you laugh , do n't I ? " <p> At college I studied philosophy . I lived in Providence , in a large dorm room with high ceilings and hardwood floors . On my bookshelf freshman year lay Penguin editions of Virginia Woolf and D. H. Lawrence , of Nietzsche and Aristotle and Montesquieu and St. Thomas Aquinas . <p> Friday nights I went to Hillel , where a rabbi spoke at the end of services and told us there was no morality without religion . My roommate was an atheist , a young man from Macon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been brought up in the church until he rebelled . <p> He wanted to know about Judaism  --  why I did n't turn on lights on Friday evenings and why I could n't eat at McDonald 's . <p> " It 's against Jewish law , " I answered . " The Bible prohibits it . " <p> " Do you believe in the Bible ? " <p> " I think so , " I said . <p> He was kind and curious . He 'd never met an Orthodox Jew and asked me if I 'd take him to services . <p> At night , we lay in our beds and talked . " Are you an atheist or an agnostic ? " I asked . <p> " What 's the difference ? " <p> I told him about Matthias , the atheist in my high school , whose sister had died of leukemia and who took off his yarmulke as soon as school let out and sat in the hallway playing acoustic guitar . Senior year he changed his mind and said he was an agnostic  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he , that we , could never be sure . <p> " I guess I 'm an agnostic , " my roommate said . <p> Weeknights I stayed up late and watched David Letterman , then went with my roommate to the all-night sandwich store , where he ordered ham on rye and I got a tuna sub with extra pickles . At home , later , I started to do schoolwork . I woke up after eleven and went to sleep at four in the morning . Once a week , I called Amir in California . <p> " You 're up late , " he said . <p> " It 's college , " I answered . " I do n't want to miss anything . " <p> " How 's the weather ? " <p> " Cold . You ? " <p> " Warm , " he said . <p> He was thinking of joining a fraternity . He had a girlfriend from the suburbs of Chicago who lived down the hall and was trying out for the Olympic gymnastics team . He tried to describe what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school , but I could n't see her  --  could n't see anything , really : California , the campus , Amir himself . <p> I grew interested in politics and got involved in the divestment movement at the end of freshman year . The following spring I spent a week camped out in a shanty in the middle of the quad . <p> " You 're becoming a radical , " my mother said on the phone . She 'd missed two finals during her freshman year of college campaigning door to door for Stevenson . <p> " Is it cold in the shanty ? " my father asked . <p> " Not really , " I answered . <p> " How 's Amir ? " asked my mother . " Do you hear from him ? " <p> " Sometimes , " I said . " Less and less , now . He 's joined a fraternity . " I rested the receiver between my head and shoulder . " He 's all the way across the country , and I can feel it .

I still live in Providence , where I 'm a graduate student in philosophy . I 'm no longer religious . I drive to the beach on Saturdays . I had sausage for breakfast yesterday morning . <p> Sometimes I wake in the middle of the night and realize I 've been dreaming about Amir . We might not be close , I understand this now , but when I think of him , when I hear his name , he 's still who he was when we were growing up , my best friend frozen in childhood . <p> I was at a friend 's house in Cape Cod when I got the phone call : his car had crashed along the California coast .

There was a eulogy to prepare and I did n't know what to say , how to sum up a life that was part of my own . <p> This is the story I tell : I 'm a senior in college and my best friend has died . I 'm an Orthodox Jew . I 'm intelligent and educated , I 've struggled with doubt , but it 's not until now when my own life 's been touched that I know for sure I can not believe .

I 'm a child again , tall and hungry among the other congregants , and I can see my grandfather , hunched over and murmuring , a blind man who knew the Talmud by heart and did n't think of eating until he finished speaking to God . <p> He died when I was eleven . His funeral took place on the Lower East Side , and I wore a suit and tie even though it was August . The speeches were in Yiddish but I stayed still : sitting and concentrating , hoping to understand . <p> Amir was waiting outside when the service was over : he 'd heard the news that morning and driven down with his father from their weekend house .

" I looked him up in the Jewish Encyclopedia . " <p> I spoke to him in California two months before he died . He 'd dropped out of his fraternity . He was going to services on some of the holidays and teaching Hebrew school to local fourth-graders . He never became religious , did n't start keeping the Sabbath or praying every day , but sometimes I wonder if that would have changed : when he grew up , if he 'd grown up , he might have found comfort in what I have lost . <p> I saw his body when it came back from California .
