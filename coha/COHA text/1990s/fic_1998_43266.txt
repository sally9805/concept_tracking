ALUHANA ! <p> Good glory , there she goes again . Morning , midnight , does n't matter with Diana . Be quiet for a minute and listen . She always does it twice or three times . <p> There it is . " ALUHANA ! " You hear it ? She 's a sweet girl , good with her rent and all , but that hollering , it 's got to stop , really it does . Gives me a nervous colon . <p> Listen , come on in , why do n't you ? I sure picked the muddiest possible day for planting bulbs . Oh , do n't worry too much about wiping your feet . That 's what I put the runners down for . <p> You 'll have to tell me how you 're settling in across the street . I 'll make us some of that good tea Diana gave me . Tastes just like flowers . I sure enjoy it , and full of vitamins , she says . She always puts honey in hers . She loves honey on anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Me , I have to use artificial sweetener all the time now for my high blood sugar . Diana tries to show me books about natural diets and proteins and such , but I ca n't stay interested long enough . If I 'm going to sit down and read something , it sure wo n't be about gluten-free noodles . <p> She burns some sort of incense every morning when she takes her bath . Smell it ? Tell me-you do n't think it 's marijuana , do you ? I would n't even know . That smell just saturates everything-the curtains , the towels . Some of the tenants before her , for Pete 's sake , they each had their own different stink . Sweaty pantyhose . Chintzy perfume . Cough syrup was another , and French-fry grease and tomcat spray . Diana 's incense , I guess it 's not as bad as most , but you tell me if you smell any marijuana . She 's a peculiar one , all right . The funny thing is , though , that for all her howling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her . She reminds me of an apple . How could you get mad at an apple ? <p> ALUHANA ! <p> Still at it , I guess . She 's upstairs in her room . Have I ever introduced you to Diana ? Really it 's just plain Diane , but she prefers Diana because she says it 's one of the thousand names of the Goddess . <p> ALUHANA ! <p> For Pete 's sake . I might as well tell you , what she 's doing is summoning her angel . That 's the angel 's name , ALUHANA . All capital letters , that 's how you have to write an angel 's name , Diana tells me . Well , I said she has a loose marble , did n't I ? Maybe I did n't . ALUHANA is Diana 's special guardian angel-all hers , I guess-and when she shouts the angel 's name it means she wants help with the book she 's trying to write . She has a rickety old computer hooked up in there , all decorated with cotton balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen part . Take a guess at what her book is about . She 's been pulling her hair out over the title . It 's down to " Reach for an Angel " or " The Ultimate Book of Angels . " I guess old ALUHANA gets the final say . Diana 's been here for three months now . We 're getting used to each other . She was real formal at first , thought she had to call me Mrs. Davies but I said no , for Pete 's sake , just call me Carol . That goes for you , too . All that Mrs. So-and-so business , nowadays I think it 's just for old people . I 'm sixty-one-nobody better say that 's old . Diana 's around forty , maybe a little younger , but she 's been through the wringer a few times . She 's got one of those unfortunate builds , just barely plump in the face and arms , but with a giant bottom that throws her into the fat gals ' department at J.C . Penney . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope , mostly gray , but with some blond still left . To look at the hair by itself you 'd say it was actually quite pretty , but on her head the gray sure ages her . She 's got that tired but scrubbed-up look you often see on people who go to recovery groups . She changes her socks five times a day . <p> Once she decided she could trust me , she told me she 'd been in a long string of abusive relationships : boyfriends who beat her up , or drank too much , or made her feel ugly and terrible about herself . There was also some sexual thing from her childhood that I was glad she did n't want to discuss at length . When she 's talking about her past , a different Diana comes out who 's perfectly normal , and I just somehow know everything she 's telling me is the truth . When she 's like that , I 'd believe her if she said her parents got gnawed to death by wolves . <p> So how do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , violets , orange blossoms , and whatnot . Here , take a look at the box . Like someone mowed down a flower garden . I should 've offered you some sweetener , golly , I always just pour a packet in the bottom of my cup and do n't think about it . I have honey if you 'd prefer . There 're two whole kitchen cabinets here chock full of Diana 's health food . Twenty-five years ago , if you 'd asked me what health food was I would have said liver with bacon . Now there 're cookbooks open on the counter every day with pictures of tofu this and tofu that , or cereal that looks like birdseed , or some beans-and-greens concoction perking away in the slow-cooker . She has dietary supplements , big horse pills the color of dead grass or rusty hinges that she takes with every meal to balance her system . Expensive ! I looked at the bottle . She does n't have much money to throw around , but what she 's got she 's swallowing at mealtimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Since I started renting out the extra room-ten years ago , almostthere 've been tenants in every kind of sad situation , most of them struggling out of some awful hole or about ready to fall in one . The rent 's not high ; it 's the small bedroom , my son Dennis 's old room . I only rent to women , not that I think a male tenant would be improper or anything , but I have to do what 's comfortable . There 've been a few who did n't work out ; the real young college girls who bring their boyfriends upstairs , for starters . I once bumped into a boy in his jockey shorts at one o'clock A.M. , for Pete 's sake . I do n't put up with that . I 'll have to admit , Diana and I are an easier match . <p> ALUHANA ! <p> For the most part . <p> I did n't need to rent out at first , after my divorce . That was in 1970the smartest divorce two people ever got . Gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of each other 's hair . Back then there was alimony , plus my job at the post office . Dennis was five , and we stayed here in Columbus while Gene moved out to Dayton and married again after a while . I wo n't be retiring for another four years , but that rent makes a nice little difference , you 'd be surprised . Dennis has a house just fifteen minutes away in Worthington with his wife and two boys . Oh , they 're the cutest kids . Dennis comes over to cut my grass or clean the rain gutter and whatnot . He 's shy of Diana , and I wish he would n't be because it hurts her feelings so . She 's real sensitive about how men , any men , react to her . On the one hand she 's thrilled with the tiniest bit of male attention , even the cashiers who smile the same way at everybody . But then there 's something else that makes her push men away , like they 're going to destroy her again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay on the ladder and shut up . <p> Diana works part-time in a fluffy yellow card shop . Two years or so ago , she got the nerve to leave her last boyfriend , but had to go stay in a women 's shelter . After that she moved to a cooperative household for survivors of rotten things . She was n't happy ; the house was noisy and had nightly meetings that lasted for hours . She says she 's " almost home " now . She wants to save enough to buy a house south or east of here , out in a country town somewhere where she can study angels but still be close enough to help other women who need it . She 's gung-ho about that book of hers . Says she 's never written anything before , but that sharing her new knowledge is part of recovery . I do n't quite see the logic . <p> I hate to say this , but I think she 's copying a lot of her book straight out of other books . Come on in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookshelf . Words of an Angel . You 'll Never Walk Alone . Cherubs . Twenty , thirty books about angels . She 'll sit on the back step if it 's nice out , copying and copying out of those books . Then I 'll hear her typing a mile a minute when I go upstairs to use the john . She does n't read anything else , except maybe her cookbooks . I tried to loan her Clan of the Cave Bear and it just sat on the foyer table until I finally took it back . <p> ALUHANA ! <p> She showed me how you find your guardian angel 's name . She has a kit , a wooden box with four velvet drawstring bags inside . At first I said I did n't want to play , but Diana insisted she wanted to find my guardian angel for me . It 's just too hard to say no to a person like that , looking up at you like they 're offering all they 've got in this world . Next thing you know I 'm listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room floor . <p> Inside the velvet bags were tiles with letters or numbers on them , a lot like Scrabble pieces . The first bag was for numbers . Three through ten , she said . You reach in and grab one , and that tells you how many letters in your angel 's name . I got a four . I guessed that was pretty good . <p> The next bag had just two tiles , a red and a pink . I pulled the pink one . That meant the angel 's name started with a consonant . Diana put those tiles back in their bags . <p> She was getting all excited , smiling and patting me like I was in childbirth . The last two bags had letters inside , one for consonants and one for vowels with extras of most letters in case your angel 's name needed them . Are you seeing the silliness of this ? She explained to me , softly and carefully , that I was to pick a consonant , then a vowel , consonant , vowel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name . Thinking about it now , it 's easy to figure out that by that system , your angel 's name could very well turn out to be BANANA or SUNOCO . I was actually embarrassed for her , but I pulled mine out . <p> C-O-T-O . Well , fine then . <p> Diana just beamed . " COTO . COTO ! " She whispered it over and over again , saying it differently each time . " COTO is the guardian angel of Carol Davies ! " Good glory . I did n't like it . It sounded too much like Kotex . <p> " Is COTO a boy or a girl ? " I asked . <p> " Guardian angels are always the same gender as the person they protect . " Diana said this like it was an absolute fact from the dictionary or something . Most likely she 'd copied it right there on the back step . <p> " Well , " I said , " what kind of a girl 's name is COTO ? " <p> " It 's an angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still could n't believe she was serious . " What if we tried it again ? " I asked her . " Odds are it would come out completely different . " <p> Diana looked at me like I was the witless half of a half-wit . " Why would you ever need to do it again ? " <p> " I did n't say I needed to . I just meant that the letters would come out differently every time , so how do you tell which name 's right ? " <p> She must have done this sidestep before . " An Angel Naming is something you do only once in your life . There 's no reason to repeat it because what you 've drawn is correct . COTO put each of those tiles in your hand-the number , the letters , the order of the letters . " <p> Diana chuckled , shook her head at me . " She 's your guardian angel . Why would she ever , ever lie to you ? " <p> You tell me , what do you do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over who believe the craziest things , like those flying saucer worshipers , or the End-of-the-World people outside the Greyhound Terminal . You 'll read in the newspaper how they all committed suicide and whatnot , then you fold up the paper and it 's like they do n't exist anymore . But now here 's a girl who shakes the ceiling yelling to her angel , and she 's living right here in my spare bedroom and stewing crabgrass in my slow-cooker . <p> Sharing is her method of preaching . When Gene and I were married , we went to church together exactly once and that was on our wedding day . You sure could n't accuse me of being overly religious , but I believe there 's a God of some sort and that it 's best not to make a production over it . I brought up Dennis that way , though of course we celebrated Christmas and Easter . Kids need that in their lives . Just being as nice to people as possible was all I told him God wanted from us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnival , I think it was . He married a Catholic girl and had to open up that can of worms , but you do n't see him spouting about the pope all day . Diana 's a different matter altogether . <p> She has this group she goes to every Sunday night . I never gave it a thought ; recovery groups are not my concern . Then , maybe a few days after that angel naming business , she started asking if I would go along . <p> " It 's an angel circle , " she said . She had that same excited , begging look . " Now that you know your guardian angel 's name , do n't you want to learn more about her ? " <p> I certainly did n't . " Sunday nights I make peanut butter bars for Dennis to take to the kids , " I told her . It 's only true about once a month and Diana knew it . <p> " I 'll help you make them in the morning , " she said . " Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're having Delvin Ayers lead the circle , coming all the way from Buffalo . He 's a Licensed Angelologist . " <p> Now what the hell is a Licensed Angelologist ? That truly gets my goat . Licensed Astrologers , Certified Professional Psychics-that 's plain crap . And then you have so many poor , desperate souls like Diana who look up to them like they were heart surgeons . I want to know who 's handing out licenses to Angelologists . I 'll give them a piece of my mind on a dirty fork . <p> Do n't ask how she got me there . I said no for two days , and the next thing I knew we were walking the four blocks to Marshall Avenue , even though I offered to drive . That Diana , she was practically skipping . It was warm out , not October-y like now , but she had on a heavy white wool cloak that went all the way to her ankles . You 'd think we were prancing down the Yellow Brick Road . That group is it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped and turned her face to the tree branches over our heads . <p> " ALUHANA ! " she shouted in the middle of the damn sidewalk . I 've known some of the neighbors on that street for thirty years . " You need to summon COTO , " she said . <p> " Not by hollering at the tree tops , I do n't ! " I felt sorry right away . Diana 's eyes sank just a bit , but then she smiled . <p> " It 's all right . She 's always with you anyway . " <p> Have you been down Marshall Avenue ? There 's that whole six-block strip where all the houses are the same split-level design with the mockbrick fronts ; cream brick on the bottom and pale gray around the bay window . She did n't need to tell me which house it was . It 's hard to miss anything when it 's got a life-size gold-foil angel nailed to it . <p> Anyway , Diana did n't even bother knocking . We walked right on in , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were talking all at once , half to each other and half to the absolute thin air . Diana took her cloak and my jacket and laid them with some others on a piano bench while I stood wondering what I should and should n't stare at . Over on the sofa , an elegant , well-dressed lady sat by herself , grinning at a cat-shaped pillow . Then she leaned over and tickled it . Some kind of choir music was playing on the stereo . I could n't figure out why the whole room looked like a TV screen with a broken color tube , and then I noticed every single lamp had a pink bulb in it . I held out my hand , turned it over . The light made my skin look sore and chapped . <p> " Welcome ! " said a short , chesty woman in a pink kimono who came at us with Styrofoam cups of punch . Probably her kimono was white , but who could tell ? Her hair was blond and cut like a little Dutch girl 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheek . <p> " Anna-Lisa , I 'd like you to meet Carol Davies . " Diana gave me a little nudge . I smiled a straight-line smile . " And with her this evening is COTO . " Anna-Lisa handed me the other punch cup and took a step back . " I welcome you to the circle , COTO ! " She bowed at the shoulders , then blew a kiss to someplace above my head . " Come in , Carol ! You need to meet everyone ! " <p> When those Jehovah 's Witnesses ring your doorbell , do you ever let them spit out a sentence or two before slamming the door ? Yes ? Well do n't , because that 's all it takes to see how very , very much they believe their own talk . Then something comes over you , pity and some kind of sad respect mixed together , and you just have to let them have their pathetic say . These angel people were like that . They truly believed they had guardian angels at their party , sipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingled , helloing people and angels alike . I 'd never seen her so lit up , really in her element . Anna-Lisa introduced me around . She could n't just say " Carol , meet Sam . " It had to be " This is Sam , and with him is BINOLAZ . " I suppose I was expected to introduce my own angel , but darned if I was going to , so Anna-Lisa did it for me . You can tell I 'm no shy violet , but what conversation do I have for the air in front of my nose ? I got introduced to more angels that night than any sane person should in five lifetimes . SAROF . XUH . UTOKABEPI . Lots of them sounded like names from Diana 's letter game , but not all . An old man in a red Valentine 's necktie told us his angel 's name was BIG MURPHY . <p> " I gave him the name myself , " he said . " It helps me get girlies into the sack . " <p> There were refreshments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookies , a big hunk of bleu cheese , a platter of mushy black and green health-food dips like Diana keeps on her shelf of the fridge . I was just standing around , thinking how I 'm overdue to change the Arm &; Hammer box , when I look and see Diana poke her head around the archway , waving me back to the group . <p> Anna-Lisa was busy with a stack of flat cushions , laying them in a big circle on the floor . <p> " We 're starting , " Diana whispered . Frankly , I 'd hoped we were almost done . " Delvin Ayers is leading us tonight . That 's him in the gray slacks . " <p> " Is he getting paid ? " I whispered back . <p> " Of course ! He 's a pro . " <p> You just picture me , parking my rear on a stranger 's floor , an angel goon on either side putting their clammy hands in mine . To my left was Diana , and holding hands with her felt odd , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side was the woman who 'd been tickling the pillow . She squirmed around to get comfortable , jiggling my arm but not letting go . <p> For whatever it 's worth , which is nothing , I can say I 've met a Licensed Angelologist . That Delvin Ayers , he sat at one end of the circle like Big Chief Thunder Cloud . He was thin and ashy-peaked , you might saywith brown hair combed over a big bald patch on top of his head . He looked like a dentist in Sunday brunch clothes . <p> " Angels among us ! " he said , gentle and cheerful . <p> " Angels among us ! " shouted everybody except me , since I did n't know enough to . <p> " It 's delightful to see so many familiar faces again , and new ones as well . We 're all grateful to Anna-Lisa Hilliard for sharing her home with us this evening . Angel 's protection to you , Anna-Lisa . " <p> " Bless and protect Anna-Lisa ! " <p> " I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence we celebrate and whose help and guidance we seek . As we light the angel candle , may we draw their energy for us to see , touch , and hold in our hearts . " <p> He stood up and took a long fireplace match from the mantle , struck it on a swatch of sandpaper , and lit a thick pink candle . Several people murmured " aaaah " like they were watching fireworks , then a few began softly chanting their angel 's names . I knew as soon as they started that Diana would have to jump on the bandwagon , though I hoped she would n't make a spectacle of herself . <p> " AL UHANA , ALUHANA , " in a tiny voice , smallest voice I 've ever heard . " She 's so beautiful , " Diana whispered to nobody . " See how beautiful she is ? " <p> Look at you there , that shine in your eyes . I know what you want me to say . Um hmm . You want to hear that I saw an angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . That magic is real and I 'm a live , sane witness , changed , a believer . Angels , spaceships-all real , and you 're safe and looked after . That 's what everybody deep down wants . You too , I guess . <p> Well , tell you what . If that 's what you want to hear , you go on home and put on your TV , because that 's the only place you 'll get angels who save you from bus wrecks and find your lost daughter and play " Beautiful Dreamer " on the piano . In Columbus , angels do n't do diddlysquat . <p> Here 's exactly what happened , like it or lump it . Delvin Ayers pulled two pie-faced women up to the front of the circle with him , a pair of sisters it turned out , roly-poly with their hair teased high , standing there with their feet splayed out like fat gals do , in silk slacks suits that looked brand new but wrinkled . <p> " What is the name of your angel ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And yours ? " <p> " HEKI. ! <p> " And what sort of help are you seeking from them this evening ? " The one with the dangly teddy-bear earrings turned to him and started sputtering , but he swiveled her by the shoulders to face the group . She cleared her throat and started again . <p> " My sister 's daughter , my niece ... her name 's Blaine ... she 's the one we 'd like help for . Her classroom . . . it 's a class for delayed learners . . . every year the class sells raffle tickets to raise money for March of Dimes . Zayre 's donated a VCR for the prize . But there 's an award for the child who sells the most tickets-a trip to Cedar Point . Blaine loves Cedar Point so much , but Dori just ca n't afford to take her very often , so we 'd love to see her be the winner . It would sure help Blaine 's self-esteem , too ; it 's a problem area for her . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Delvin Ayers herded them back to their places in the circle , where everyone 's hands were linked . <p> " BRIGHTNESS and HEKI , " he said with his eyes closed , " We call on you to grant your loving assistance . " He recited a big long prayer that people in the circle hummed or bobbed their heads to . I just sat there . At the end he cried , " So may it be ! " <p> " So may it be ! " yelled the whole peanut gallery . <p> He opened his eyes . This fellow was smooth . <p> " How many tickets does Blaine need to sell ? " he asked . The one named Dori spoke up and said last year 's winner sold 160 , so she figured about 200 would do it . <p> " They 're a dollar each , " she added . <p> " And how might we assist the angels in their work ? " He scanned the group , counting . <p> " I think if everyone here were to buy , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cedar Point . " <p> The candle made his scalp shine . <p> " Do you have any tickets with you tonight ? " he asked the sisters . <p> They sure did . <p> " Then who will purchase ten tickets ? Actually , who will not help ? May I hear from you now ? " Nobody said a word . In my mind I was whacking Diana on the head with a bag of rocks . <p> " Then the angels have completed their task . BRIGHTNESS and HEKI , we thank you from our hearts ! " <p> " We thank you ! " <p> It was n't the end . People got up and asked their angels for all sorts of things and Delvin Ayers found ways to make it happen . He never took credit . One lady wanted nothing but a ride home that night . The angels got thanked every time , and loudly . Got my colon up and rumbling . Some cried-they had an alcoholic relative or a tumor in their breast-and Delvin Ayers solemnly promised that their angels were standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smile through their tears . <p> It was their faces that really got me . I 've seen it before . Back when my brother and I were young kids , our Uncle Will showed us photos he took of the Ozark snake handlers at a state fair someplace . They charmed poisonous water moccasins for Jesus . We thought the snakes were scary enough-mindless and mean-but those poor hillbillies ' faces , how holy they thought it all was , that 's what haunted me every night for weeks when I tried to sleep . I 'd lay in the dark , trying not to picture their dumb , sweaty rapture . These angel people had faces like that . They swayed and their chins trembled , shot full of a kind of joy I guess I 'll never understand . In one of Uncle Will 's photos , you ca n't make out the top half of the snake , just a black and white blur like a comet whizzing toward the handler 's cheekbone . Uncle Will said his camera flash was to blame . He backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands on the poor convulsing guy , pushing the medics away . <p> Angels and snakes . I do n't make much distinction . <p> ALUHANA ! <p> Gosh , she 's been quiet a long time . I hope she did n't hear any of this . What I 've been telling you , I do n't mean in a bad way . Well , maybe I do , just a little . <p> After the circle broke up and everyone started milling around again , I was over by the mantle writing out a damn check for ten raffle tickets when Anna-Lisa tapped me on the elbow and said she felt her angel and my angel had a strong historic bond . That was it . I found Diana and said I was tired and going home , but she would n't let me walk by myself . <p> Out on Marshall Street she was still jabbering about her angel . I did n't say a word . I wanted to make it home without a discussion . She watched me from the side . <p> " You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't answer . " ALUHANA wanted you to like it . " <p> I turned on the heel of my tennis shoe-I should have held my breath and counted to ten but she 'd gone too far with me . <p> " Diana , " I said , " do you realize you 're a full-grown adult with an imaginary friend ? " <p> It felt right to say it , and I was n't sorry . Diana stood stock still , blinking , looking from me to the sidewalk and back like she 'd stepped on a glue trap . I could n't tell if she was getting a speech set up or going to cry or what . She looked like a toddler , surprised by a fall , betrayed . Right then I suddenly needed to use the john something terrible . Diana took a timid step or two toward me , her hand outstretched for mine , but I cut her off . <p> " You get on home , " I said just like she was my own kid . Her face twitched-she looked grown-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away in quick , slappy steps , her shoulders held high . I managed to wait until she 'd rounded the corner , then hurried myself , squeezing tight , hating how everything always wants to come out at once . <p> Later that night , I was shuffling around upstairs , third or fourth trip to the john , tired and not , thirsty and not . Diana 's light was on , dim yellow through the cracks of her closed door . Tap , tap , tap on her computer keys . I thought I should apologize . I stared at my slippers , picked at a thumbnail . <p> " Sleep tight , " I said too softly for her to hear , or so I thought . " You too , " she answered , full and clear . Gave me a spook . Her keyboard kept tapping . Did she know it was me , or mistake me for an angel ? <p> ALUHANA ! <p> You 'll run into Diana before long-she takes her bike out most evenings for a spin around the neighborhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her rear hangs over the sides . The kids make jokes about her , I think , but if you see her , could you give her a hi , or a wave ? Could you ? Just something friendly . You might stop short of inviting her in , but if you happen to be out front , she 's fine for a chat . Talk to her about food ; she 'd enjoy that . <p> And please , no need to mention what you know . <p>
