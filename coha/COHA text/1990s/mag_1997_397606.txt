It 's been a long time coming , but digital TV will finally be available-in a year . // Do n't worry , no one is forcing you to buy a new TV Yet . After a long , hard haul of over lb years , digital high-definition TV ( HI ) TV ) is becoming a reality . The first sets are expected to appear in retail stores by the fourth quarter of 1998-or just about one year from now . Heralded as the most important revolution in broadcast TV since color , HDTV has been the focus of a bitter confrontation between the consumer electronics and computer industries , with different factions proposing their own HDTV broadcast standards . At the end of last year , the FCC finally decided on a standard for the new format and started the manufacturing ball rolling . Last April , network television broadcasters finally kicked in their two cents and agreed to a timetable for digital broadcasting to begin . So now that the hype is finally out , what do you need to know about these new , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become obsolete ? And more importantly , what can a digital TV do for you ? The promise of HDTV Photograph See the difference ? The left side is a regular NTSC picture , while the right side is a high-definition picture . We think it 's clear as a bell . // Digital television is expected to bring a whole new experience to the American television viewer . Now , in addition to plain old channel surfing , you 'll be able to surf the Web , play videogames , even connect your TV to your computer for business-all with a crystal clear , almost 3-dimensional picture . But will a country full of couch potatoes deem these new features valuable enough to spend big bucks for new TVs ? Will you ? Nobody has been able to answer this question vet , though il host of high-powered companies such as So ny , Philips , Thomson , Microsoft and Oracle are testing the average consumer with products such as WebTV set-top boxes , hoping to bridge the gap between analog and digital sets before the big transition begins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over the next few years consumers may be faced with some confusion regarding televisions . This is because television manufacturers are faced with a dilemma . They need to make sure their bread-and-butter analog sets continue to sell while simultaneously promoting the idea of a whole new age of high-tech television ( with prices already forecast at over $2000 a pop and perhaps between $5000 and $11,000 ) . As for broadcasters , both NBC and CBS have made a move to ensure digital broadcasting by Christmas 1998 . The FCC supported this cooperation between broadcasters and hardware manufacturers by approving a timetable to begin preparations for digital broadcasting , anticipating that 10 national markets will begin digital broadcasting within two years . The hope is that this will be enough time for consumers to sort out their wants and needs . Undoubtedly , some will upgrade to digital sets and prices of equipment will hopefully fall . Both analog and digital signals are expected to be broadcast until at least 2006 . How HDTV works First off , let 's clear up the confusion about high-definition TV . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compatible TV ( ACTV ) , which had a clearer picture than a than conventional set . These sets were analog sets with a widescreen aspect ratio of 5:9 , instead of 16:9 . In order to create the wider screen and a higher-quality picture , pixels were added to the end of each line of the display-up to 660 , compared to the more conventional 550 . We 're not talking about those TV sets here . Today 's high-definition sets must be able to receive digital signals . So let 's start by understanding the difference between analog and digital signals . Any signal , be it digital or analog , has some work to do before it gets from a TV camera in a studio to your home . Let 's look at a digital signal first . From the TV camera in the studio , the signal is transferred to a camera control unit , to a switcher , to a master control switcher , and then through a compression engine to a multiplexer , which combines one or more TV programs into the **29;264;TOOLONG stream that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transmitter , to an antenna , travels through the air , is recognized by your antenna , and comes down through the antenna and into your set . In the case of a cable setup , the cable company 's antenna reads the signal as it is traveling through the air , captures it and sends it to your set via hard wires . For an analog signal , just subtract the multiplexer and the compression engine from the equation . Digital relies on a constant stream of small bits ( ones and zeros ) , instead of analog waves that may change size or speed . With digital TV , a digital signal is implanted in a carrier wave , which is simply the channel or frequency , ensuring a perfect picture . This is unlike analog broadcasting today , where signals sometimes degrade , resulting in ghosting or snow on your screen , especially in areas where your analog set is very distant from the transmitter . Photograph HOW A DIGITAL TV SIGNAL TRAVELS FROM A TV CAMERA TO YOUR TV SET // It 's all or nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and zeros-and a perfect picture on your set-or you do n't get a picture at all . There 's no halfway about it and it has nothing to do with how far the signal travels . It does n't matter if you live in the suburbs , far from the local TV or cable station or in a city surrounded by tall buildings . Nothing will be able to block the signal . It may stop suddenly , but it ca n't be retarded in any way . In order for a TV to broadcast a real digital picture , the digital stream must pass through a standard FCC digital encoder installed right before the transmitter . This encoder ensures that the signal stays digital all the way to your screen . The guts of a digital television set work the same as analog TV . The difference is all in the tuner . In a conventional analog set , the receiver in the tuner is hooked to the carrier frequency . The receiver then takes a look at that frequency and demodulates the signal . In a digital TV set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the digital tuner sees a signal coming , it takes it off the carrier and puts it through a standard MPEG2 decoder embedded in the set . Once the picture is formed , it is modified depending on what kind of display it 's working with . If it 's data , it must go through the data port . The first series of sets will be made with dual receivers , allowing the sets to accommodate both analog and digital signals and absolving you from being forced to buy a new television even if stations are broadcasting digitally . Manufacturers are not ready to disclose whether there will be two different receivers or one receiver that will take in both analog and digital signals . " It 's too early to mention this detail yet-for competitive reasons , " claims a source at Zenith . Early buyers can also be assured that analog programming will still be available . The dual receivers are also important for folks with home movie libraries . Will older VHS tapes play on these new sets ? Yes . As long as there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch VHS movies on your analog VCR . High-definition TV is just one example of what can be done with digital television . When broadcasters begin transmitting digitally , they 'll have a choice of showing one high-definition channel or multiplexing the digital signal into three or five channels of programming or data with a lesser picture quality . Many broadcasters have expressed an interest in showing HDTV for prime-time shows and multiplexing bit stream data during daytime hours , according to Dennis Wharton , spokesperson for the National Association of Broadcasters ( NAB ) . Most prime-time programming is filmed using 35mm film , which lends itself nicely to the conversion to high definition . Not only is the source quality very high , but 35mm film has a higher density of exposure and captures things more precisely than 16mm film . Basically , it 's all about picture quality and bandwidth . High definition provides a bright , sharp and crystal clear picture with absolutely no artifacts , but it takes up a much wider bandwidth than a regular digital signal . Cable and satellite TV is another piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribers and just over 7 million satellite subscribers in the United States today-according to the National Cable Television Association ( NCTA ) and the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association ( SBCA ) - subscribers may want to know if current services will still be applicable with digital TV . Photograph FOR CABLE // Satellite is already a digitally compressed service , so nothing much is expected to change . The problem for the satellite industry comes with HDTV . Because of the signal 's much wider bandwidth , satellite companies would have to significantly cut down the number of channels they broadcast if they want to put out a full , high-definition system . Chuck Hewitt , the SBCA 's president , says many satellite companies are expecting to broadcast a few channels in high definition , but leave most in their original state . " We can provide high definition any time we want , but the American public has n't made any sort of decision on what they want yet , " he insists . " I do n't think you 're going to see a 200-channel satellite system go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of HDTV . In my opinion , the consumer wants choice . " Cable , however , is not typically a digital service , although some cable companies , such as TCI , are presently providing digital service . " We are fully compatible with digital TV right now and our bandwidth will most definitely take a high-definition signal , " asserts Peter Douglas , vice president of operations and engineering at TCI National Digital Television Center . " But lately , it seems that the " H ' has been left out of HDTV . " Home Box Office ( HBO ) charted new territory for the cable industry by saying it would begin offering highdefinition signals by summer 1998 . What 's available now ? Zenith and Mitsubishi are the first manufacturers to announce plans to bring digital TVs to retail , predicting a late-1998 launch date , " but definitely in time for Christmas , " adds John Taylor , vice president of Zenith Public Affairs . Zenith 's first HDTVs are expected to be about 64 in. diagonal . The prices quoted by Taylor are between $5000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it expects to have up to four rear-projection models available in late 1998 . They will include a chip being jointly developed with Lucent Technologies and are expected to cost between $8000 and $11,000 . <p>
