Saturn 's rare display of light and shadow brought planetary astronomers some unexpected surprises . Photograph Thanks to the Hubble Space Telescope , Saturn 's ring system never completely vanished during the 1995-96 series of ring-plane crossings . This was HST 's view between 13:12 and 13:22 Universal Time on August 6th , four days before the ring plane swept over Earth .

The planet 's ring plane has slipped across the Earth and Sun 82 times since Galileo was first perplexed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the planet 's geometric spectacle , always alert to the discoveries that come when the beautiful rings vanish from view . Thirteen of Saturn 's 18 known moons were found during these special times . " It 's ironic , " notes observer Andrew S. Rivkin ( University of Arizona ) , " but the best time to learn about Saturn 's rings is when they 're not actually there . " Such disappearances occur when Saturn reaches one of its equinoxes , which occur twice during the planet 's 29 1/2-year orbit . The circumstances in 1995-96 offered a boon to observers : Earth was in the ring plane three times ( May 22nd , August 10th , and February 11th ) , and we viewed the side of the rings in shadow from the Sun 's plane crossing on November 19th through early February . Armed with fortuitous geometry and an array of new imaging technologies , astronomers anticipated a big payoff . During the disappearance in May , Amanda S. Bosh ( Lowell Observatory ) and Rivkin spied four moonlet candidates in Hubble Space Telescope images ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one designated 1995 S1 appears to have been the known moon Atlas , even though it was found 25deg ahead of the predicted position . Dynamicists believe they can accommodate the misfit , since Atlas 40 kilometers long and An error of just 0.4 second in its presumed orbital period , compounded over 14 years , would account for the shift in location . The HST object dubbed 1995 S3 was initially touted as a newly discovered moon . However , at magnitude 17.5 it should have been seen - but was n't by one of the Voyagers or by HST 's camera during the later plane crossings . Bosh concedes that S3 was likely a large but temporary clot of particles on the outer edge of the F ring , a thin band just beyond the wreath of Saturn 's more familiar rings . A second false alarm was raised by the candidate 1995 S4 , which was glimpsed briefly in May but not seen again . PROBLEMATIC PROMETHEUS The brightest of the blips seen by HST , 1995 S2 , made itself known in both May and August . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner of two satellites discovered by Voyager that straddle the F ring . But it lagged the moonlet 's predicted location by 20deg in May and 19deg later in 1995 . Gravitational interactions with the A ring are gradually pushing Prometheus outward and thus lengthening its orbital period . However , the accumulated lag in the years since the Voyager 2 flyby amounts to a mere 0.2deg- a hundredth of what was observed . " We really did n't expect this Prometheus problem , " says Bosh . According to investigator Philip D. Nicholson ( Cornell ) , who coordinated the HST camera observations in August and November , three ideas might explain Prometheus 's wandering . First , its movement could be more eccentric than thought , such that at times the moonlet scoots along faster or slower than its mean rate . But this dynamical fiddling is probably unrealistic . Measuring a respectable 140 by 80 km , Prometheus was easy prey for the Voyagers , and its orbit is known too precisely to permit 20deg of positional slop . In fact , by running the Voyager-derived orbit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken during the ring-plane crossings of 1980 and even 1966 .

Inset : No fewer than three satellites and the F ring crowd space within 6,000 kilometers of the A ring 's outer edge . Moons not seen since their discovery 14 years ago were recovered ( black dots ) - but not necessarily where expected ( gray dots ) . The wandering of Prometheus is particularly puzzling . Observers are also sorting out whether some of the " satellites " are merely clumps of material within the F ring . Courtesy P. Nicholson . // A second possibility is that Prometheus collided with something massive enough to retard its orbital motion . However , in that case the lag should be gradually increasing with time . For example , a hit just after Voyager 2 's 1981 flyby would cause the lag to grow by 0.11deg per month . But just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the time , Prometheus and the F ring occasionally do come into intimate contact . Carl D. Murray ( Queen Mary and Westfield College , London ) and Silvia M. Giuliatti Winter ( UNESP , Brazil ) have deduced that collisions occur every 19.1 years ; the last one began in 1990 and might still be going on . If Prometheus got a jolt 5 years ago its orbital lag must have accumulated since then and should have grown another 1deg between August and November , whereas HST data show a change of just 0.08deg . Murray still thinks Prometheus gets bumped around during its forays into the F ring , and that such collisions might play a role in shaping the moon 's orbit . But he admits the evidence does not favor his model . The best suggestion to date , most agree , is that a small companion moon shares Prometheus 's orbit . The two objects would occasionally crowd one another but never actually collide , instead exchanging a bit of angular momentum before moving apart . ( Saturn 's small moons Janus and Epimetheus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induce the observed shift in the motion of Prometheus , a hypothetical companion would need 1/30 its mass , making it roughly the size of Atlas . Coincidently , last August three groups of observers did spot something trailing Prometheus in its orbit by about 15deg . Designated 1995 S7 , the object had a magnitude of 17.9 and an estimated size in Atlas 's range . But it was n't seen in May or November ( Saturn was near the Sun during February 's ring-plane crossing ) . Nor was the putative moonlet obvious to either of the Voyagers , which scrutinized the F ring and its surroundings with scores of images . " It 's a nice explanation , " observes theorist Luke Dones ( NASA/Ames Research Center ) . " But it predicts a satellite that 's pretty large . " Nicholson still holds out some hope that Prometheus has a coorbiting companion , noting that its key attribute must be mass , not size or brightness . But he is bothered by 1995 S7 's apparent stealthiness and concedes it was probably a large clump in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consensus yet on the lag mechanism for Prometheus , " Nicholson says . " We 're unhappy with all of them . " One of last year 's disappointments was the failure to recover Pan , a 20-km moonlet trapped within the Encke gap in the outer A ring . Some observing teams suspect that Pan is lurking in their images , but a traffic jam of other objects has made its positive identification impossible . Photograph Left : Particles in the F ring are trapped between the two small " shepherding " satellites , Prometheus and Pandora . When Voyager 2 snapped this image in August 1981 , the two moons were only 1,800 km apart . Another satellite , Pan , was later discovered embedded in the A ring , circling within a narrow clearing called the Encke gap . Dynamicists know very little about the workings of the F ring . For example , its various strands appeared knotted and kinked to Voyager 1 in 1980 ( middle ) but smooth to Voyager 2 only 9 1/2 months later ( right ) . Clumps seen then and during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collisions have occurred . // Sorting out the goings-on would be easier if there were n't so many decoys in and near the F ring . Hubble investigators conclude that 1995 S3 , S5 , S6 , and S7 are probably all clumps of F-ring particles . These " sandbank satellites " appear to be short-lived - they are obvious in some images but absent in others taken a few months earlier or later . Similar bunchings in the F ring likely fooled many wouldbe moon discoverers during the edge-on events in 1966 and 1980 . The F ring has been an enigma ever since Pioneer 11 chanced upon it in 1979 . Its discovery elated celestial mechanicians Peter Goldreich and Scott D. Tremaine , who a year before had predicted that gravitational forces from small satellites could confine particles into narrow rings . Voyager 1 completed the picture with the discovery of the F ring 's " shepherds , " Prometheus and Pandora , in 1980. // Top : In this sequence of images acquired August 10th by HST 's WFPC 2 camera , the rings ' west ansa ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious within hours of minimum light .

Nicholson . // But satellite confinement is about the extent of what dynamicists think they understand about this unpredictable band . Whereas Voyager 1 spotted a bizarre series of kinked and contorted " braids , " Voyager 2 saw nothing but smooth symmetry when it arrived 9 1/2 months later . " The F ring is strange , " Murray admits , " even for a planet surrounded by strange rings . " Now observers suspect that the F ring may be throwing off their attempts to gauge the thickness of Saturn 's rings . The true vertical depth is only about 10 to 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Earth the rings have always looked much thicker : 2.4 km when edge on in 1966 and 1.1 km in 1980 . Most researchers have ascribed the thickening to minor warps in the ring plane , levitated " spokes " of fine dust , and embedded satellites . The presence of the F ring may dominate all of these effects . In May the time of minimum light during the ring-plane crossing occurred 23 minutes later than predicted . In August the west ansa 's crossover preceded the east 's by 50 minutes , and in November 's HST images much of the F ring lay hidden in the A ring 's shadow . All this evidence suggests that the F ring is very slightly inclined mere thousandths of a degree - with respect to the main ring system . Bosh adds that minute changes in Saturn 's pole position or precession rate may have influenced the crossing time too . THE OTHER RING SYSTEM Even though the F ring stole the show last year , investigators found plenty to look at elsewhere in the planet 's ring system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they must be enshrouded in a tenuous amount of water vapor . The water itself is undetectable , but not so the hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl ( OH ) molecules formed when water breaks down . About a week before the August ringplane crossing , Doyle T. Hall ( Johns Hopkins University ) and three collaborators exploited HST 's ultraviolet sensitivity to probe the gas hovering near the ring system . They detected OH emission at 3085 angstroms just above the A and F rings and in three locations extending away from the B ring . Based on this feeble fluorescence , the Saturnian ring system must be losing about 3 tons of water per second . That 's too much gas to be created by the impact of interplanetary dust alone . Surprisingly , the cloud is densest , several hundred OH molecules per cubic centimeter , above the F ring . " I 've convinced myself we 're seeing a torus of gas , with a peak outside the main rings , " says Doyle . He suspects that most of the gas is being launched from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by magnetospheric ions and flecks of ice imported from the faint E and G rings farther out . Discovered in 1966 , the E ring is more tenuous than any of Saturn 's other bands yet was spotted by both HST and large ground-based telescopes . It extends from near the orbit of Mimas to beyond that of Dione - three times the breadth of rings A , B , and C. Last year observers confirmed its very blue color , first noted in 1980 by observer Stephen M. Larson ( University of Arizona ) . The quirky blue hue probably has nothing to do with composition . Instead , modelers argue that the E ring 's icy particles are almost all 1 micron across , too small to scatter the long , red wavelengths of visible light very efficiently . These flecks of ice come predominantly from the large moon Enceladus ; once lofted into space they are smeared into a huge but sparse ring by a fortuitous combination of sunlight 's radiation pressure , gravitational tugs from Saturn , and electromagnetic charging . Observers recorded both E and G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawaii . Team leader Imke de Pater ( University of California ) had expected to see only the E ring , blue color notwithstanding . In Keck 's images its faint smear can be traced to the orbit of Tethys , about 250,000 km from Saturn . Glimpsing the G ring , which had never been seen from Earth , was a pleasant surprise for the Keck team . " It 's much brighter than predicted , " de Pater says , " probably half as bright as the E ring . " She explains that to be seen at 2.2 microns its color must be rather neutral , an indication that the ring contains larger particles than the E ring . Some rock-size pieces must be in there too ; they absorb high-energy protons in the vicinity , a reduction that betrayed the ring 's presence to Pioneer 11 in 1979 . Managers of the forthcoming Cassini mission are following the ring-plane results closely . They are especially eager to understand the G ring , which will be crossed by the spacecraft when it reaches Saturn early next century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hope that those data will finally explain the mysterious workings of Prometheus , the F ring , and much , much more . // Right : Saturn 's E and G rings extend beyond the classical ring system in this infrared ( 22-micron ) image from the Keck I telescope .
