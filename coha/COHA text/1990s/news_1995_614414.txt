<p> At age 78 , Robert Shaw refuses to rest on his laurels . The most- honored choral conductor of the century explores new territory in this generous collection of a cappella sacred music , producing one of the most extraordinary albums of his long career . <p> Sung by the 76 handpicked choristers from a three-week workshop held in the Quercy region of France , the performances are classic Shaw in their merger of technical perfection with soulful spirituality . But this may be the best chorus he has ever produced . The radiant beauty and refinement of the singing defies description , as does the profundity of the interpretations , with tempos often so slow that time seems to stand still . <p> Selections range from the ecstatic simplicity and serenity of Henryk Gorecki 's Marian motet " Totus Tuus " and the haunting austerity of Arvo Part 's " Magnificat , " to the hyper-romantic complexity of Schoenberg 's fervent plea for peace , " Friede auf Erden . " Rounding out the disc are Samuel Barber 's " Agnus Dei , " a vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Swiss composer Frank Martin 's 1922 " Mass " for double chorus . The latter proves remarkably evocative ; highlights include a rapturous piling up of sonorities on the word " Gloria , " the prayerlike caressing of the word " Sanctus " ( " Holy " ) and the jazzy conclusion to the Sanctus , with its unbridled shouts of joy . <p> To call Soundline , dial 511 , then enter 8600 .

CD/cassette. *** 1/2 Steve Dollar , staff writer <p> Patterning its barroom-ready collusion of lazy twang and anxious feedback on such ornery models as Neil Young and Crazy Horse , the Athens band Dashboard Saviors can come across at once laid-back and all het up . The songs that make up the veteran quartet 's " Love Sorrow Hatred Madness " belong to characters with time on their hands - and six-packs to kill while their minds race circles around possibility . Catastrophe or revelation may be imminent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guitarist Todd McBride alternates vocal and songwriter duties with guitarist Rob Veal . The former roots himself in introspection and rage ; the latter applies his higher , Neil-like pitch to shaggy-dog sagas bulging with haywire guitar parts . Both singers give the album a broader range than previous Saviors ' discs . McBride 's rueful " Watching You " could be a country radio power ballad , complete with a simmering guitar solo that evokes Claptonesque blues-rock . And his " Lori Grew Up " seems a trivial shuffle , but the lyrics - sung about a young friend about to have her first baby - offer a delicately shaded dance of emotions . For all the sonic bluster the band indulges in , and with a contagious , hard-earned glee , its songs can prove astoundingly subtle . <p> Newfound fans of Jack Logan also should check out his work here : " Training Wheels , " a darkly funny tale of good country people who knock the daylights out of a rube , then pause to regret . . . that they did n't do him worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8600 .

CD/cassette. **** Miriam Longino , staff writer <p> With her board-straight cropped hair and Depression-era overalls , Mary Karlzen stares out from the cover of her new CD like something out of a 1930s Southern novel - " To Kill a Mockingbird 's " Scout with a record contract . But just when you expect to hear a dobro or the sound of chickens clucking , she jump-starts her debut album with a blast of raucous rock that is unexpectedly fresh , smart and played with a seductive passion . <p> The diminutive Karlzen 's sound is a mix of alternative and mainstream rock influences . Like Tom Petty &; the Heartbreakers , her driving songs are built around standard-issue Byrds ' acoustic guitars with an electric veneer . The high , little-girl voice sounds a lot like Jane Wiedlin of the Go-Gos - you either love it or hate it . But this ingenue has an attitude , tossing out barbs such as " do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the same kind of highly charged , tough-girl energy that gives Maria McKee or Lucinda Williams their edge . She 's a female John Hiatt . <p> What really pulls Karlzen out from the parade of hopeful newcomers is her lyrics . She wrote all 12 songs here , and they are loaded with cheeky observations and wistful sentiment on ( mostly ) love from a woman 's perspective . In " Stronger , " Karlzen reflects on a romance gone bad : " I always thought I would be/a stronger girl than the one who lives in me . " The mood changes in " Anywhere Is Better Than Here , " where she has gotten mad enough to shout " I 've never felt so strong and alive/than to pack up , leave you and drive . " On " Wooden Man , " it 's time to start over : " And now I finally understand/there is a life beyond this wooden man . " <p> To call Soundline , dial 511 , then enter 8600 .

One CD-ROM track . *** 1/2 Bob Townsend , For the Journal-Constitution <p> Poised at the sharpest point of cutting-edge , multimedia technology , Sarah McLachlan 's " The Freedom Sessions " was manufactured to be playable on both CD-ROM and conventional audio CD systems . Available in Canada on McLachlan 's native label ( Nettwerk ) since early this year , it will be released Tuesday in the United States . <p> The bad news for those of us who have n't made the latest high-tech leap yet is that the set 's intriguing bonus selection of video clips , sound bites and graphics ( configured as the last track on the U.S. version ) can only be seen and heard when installed in a CD-ROM player . But the best news for everyone ( except maybe turntable junkies ) is that the eight audio tracks found here are an even bigger treat . <p> " The Freedom Sessions " could just as easily have been titled " Sarah Unplugged . " Primarily derived from the formative , acoustic versions of seven of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary , " " Good Enough , " " Hold On , " " Ice Cream " and " Ice " ) that ultimately appeared on her 1994 , platinum-selling breakthrough album , " Fumbling Towards Ecstasy , " it displays McLachlan 's earthy charm and soaring vocals in all their unfettered glory . And what 's more , the final music-only track is her hip , after-hours cover of Tom Waits ' " Ol ' 55 " - which also appears on the " Boys on the Side " soundtrack . <p> To call Soundline , dial 511 , then enter 8600 .

CD/cassette. ** 1/2 Sonia Murray , staff writer <p> You get the gloomy feeling that Tupac Shakur 's third solo album will be his last .

Though it lacks the grace and lyrical strength of Hathaway 's ballad , the feel that this is more a personal lament than a crafted song is undeniable . And poignant . A rarity in most rap records where the key " p " is posturing . <p> It 's not like Shakur does n't have a lot of personal worries to draw from . Currently imprisoned for sexual assault , the rapper/actor has been convicted and acquitted of numerous criminal acts over the past two years . The reckless behavior he admits has defined his 23 years often translated into reckless , spotty records . <p> Focusing solely on his mortality turns out to be good for Shakur because it makes this effort much more consistent . And no matter how many times he deals with it - " So Many Tears , " " Me Against the World , " " If I Die 2Nite , " " Death Around the Corner " - the above-par production makes each appeal seem new .

CD/cassette. *** 1/2 Sonia Murray , staff writer <p> As rappers so often say , let 's be real for a minute . It 's not very often that hip-hop is hip . Original , cutting-edge , you know the definition . Most of today 's offerings are rantings laden with P-Funk samples stamped with " I 'm hard " on their foreheads in bold red ink . <p> Well , drumroll please , here comes the exception . Serving up " **27;815;TOOLONG " in huge helpings is the Philadelphia-based rap band the Roots . ( OK , come on , when 's the last time you 've seen the word " band " follow " rap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Roots get back to basics , elevating hip-hop pioneer Doug E. Fresh 's 1985 human beat box to Bobby McFerrin levels ( " ? vs . Rahzel " ) ; reminding us that at its peak a rapper 's flow could resemble Ella Fitzgerald 's scat ( " Proceed " and " Datskat " ) ; and making everyday goings-on a lot less abrasive than their gangster peers , by keeping it plain , easy and accessible . <p> There is the risk with the Roots ' loose , **25;844;TOOLONG approach to rap that there will be as much room for hits as misses . Luckily this jazz-heavy debut swings , and hits most of them out of the park . <p> The Roots will perform March 30 at the Masquerade . <p> To call Soundline , dial 511 , then enter 8600 .
