Twenty-five years ago this month , Harvard said no . So did Yale , Princeton , Dartmouth , Columbia and Williams . I can still see my 18-year-old self standing by the mailbox in stunned disbelief , holding six white envelopes . Six anorexically thin white envelopes . The precise wording of the form letters has been lost to history , but I can still conjure up their face-saving phrases like " many strong candidates " and " very difficult decisions . " Reading them one right after another , it seemed like an Ivy League chorus was cheerfully wishing me " the best of luck with your college career . " Best of luck , that is , as long as I enrolled somewhere else . <P> Even with good grades and high test scores , I should have known that I was courting rejection by the sheer act of applying . The odds of getting into schools like Harvard and Dartmouth that year were worse than 1 out of 4 . Perhaps if I had lived somewhere distant like Indiana or California , I might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elitism . My problem was that by my senior year in high school , I was already an insufferable East Coast snob . So by the social standards of suburban Connecticut in the mid-1960s , the multiple rejections consigned me to the outer darkness , destined to be shunned on commuter trains , blackballed at country clubs and never allowed to buy a home in a community with four-acre zoning . I would have to plod through life stigmatized by the knowledge that I had been judged " Not Ivy League material . " <P> Such adolescent angst was , of course , ludicrous . Every life has its disappointments ; rejection by the college of your choice is probably more serious than not finding a date for the prom and less grievous than your mother throwing out a collection of 1950s baseball cards . Even then I was aware that my safety school was far better than most . So I stoically trudged off to the University of Michigan , a college that seemed majestically impervious to the damaged goods it was receiving . Michigan more than fulfilled its part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the inability to commune with head waiters in flawless French , tone-deaf ignorance of classical music , and scientific training that stopped with Mr. Wizard ) are entirely my own fault . At 43 I can safely conclude that the lack of an Ivy League imprimatur has neither marred my career nor deprived me of any social entree that I would have enjoyed . <P> Why then , a quarter of a century later , do I still find painful the memory of those six undernourished envelopes ? Why do I periodically peek into college-rating handbooks to see how Michigan is faring against the Ivy League ? And why do I sometimes blanch when friends innocently suggest lunch at the Harvard Club ?
