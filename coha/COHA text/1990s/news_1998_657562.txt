<p> In today 's age of look-alike cars , many automakers struggle to define themselves and give shoppers a reason to choose their products . Chief among them is Nissan , a distant third among Japanese automakers and a company still struggling to grow its market share in America . The question for Nissan executives is : Why should someone buy an Altima or Maxima sedan instead of a Toyota Camry or Honda Accord ? The answer , they say , is a new wave of distinctive products that buyers say they want now - more trucks , more versatility , more passion . And not more price . To that end , Nissan has some new ideas about what Americans will be driving after the turn of the century . And in an act unprecedented by a foreign carmaker , it offered press and pundits a glimpse of future models as long as four years in advance . The company hopes to wow naysayers with promise of a turnaround . The three most promising new products are a new small sport utility vehicle to be introduced next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of truck that will likely be produced in some form early next century . <p> Small SUV The linchpin in this coming lineup is Nissan 's new entry-level $ 20,000 sport utility vehicle . Nissan wants it to go head to head with the popular and car like Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 , but the company aims to be anything but car like . " As automakers all move toward more carlike and more luxurious SUVs , we see a big hole opening up right in the middle of the sport utility vehicle market , " says Jerry Hirschberg , president of Nissan 's West Coast design studio , which designed the new truck . Nissan 's " New SUV " will be " deliberately rough hewn " with " in-your-face " styling . Most mid-size SUVs - such as the Ford Explorer and Jeep Grand Cherokee - have grown larger and more expensive with each revision . This new off-roader aims to roll over that trend . It is compact , yet retains plenty of back-seat room and slightly less cargo space than Nissan 's current Pathfinder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a standard " safari " rack - essentially a big roof rack with a suspended storage bin . Behind the safari rack , the roof steps up about 6 inches so rear passengers have plenty of headroom . But while the still unnamed SUV will be smaller than today 's mid-size models , it has much more space than the " mini " Toyota RAV4 or Suzuki versions . And unlike , the car-based RAV4 and CR-V , the new Nissan is designed to go off-road , with a sturdy , part-time four-wheel-drive system . Nissan officials expect the current , larger Pathfinder to continue as an upscale alternative . The new SUV will appear as a 2000 model about 12 months from now . <p> Sport utility truck Looking farther in the future , Nissan hopes to provide even more versatility by crossing the new SUV with a small pickup truck . Research at Mr. Hirschberg 's Nissan Design International ( NDI ) in La Jolla , Calif. , found that while people buy sport utility vehicles to bridge the gap between cars and trucks , they are loath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard mulch , topsoil , gravel , and trash for the dump . At the same time , researchers found that those who own trucks for such tasks rarely use more than one-third of the truck bed for most trips . Hence the sport-utility truck ( SUT ) , with four-wheel drive , lots of amenities , room for five passengers , and a short , open , three-foot pickup bed . Hirschberg calls these the " clean zone " and the " dirty zone " - any grubby cargo stays out of the interior and away from carpet and upholstery . For those rare events when project-minded homeowners buy a load of lumber , a door on the back of the passenger compartment swings up , connecting it to the truck bed . The back seats fold down , leaving a flat , eight-foot space that starts behind the front seats . The SUT would come , initially , with four-wheel drive and a V-6 engine . The SUT is still just a concept , not yet approved for production , and a full-size bright yellow model on display for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take years to work out , by 2002 or 2003 at the earliest . But enthusiastic dealers say they could sell it now , bolstering the prospects for production approval . In the meantime , Nissan plans a four-door version of its small Frontier pickup , with an abbreviated back seat , regular forward-opening rear doors , and a standard six-foot cargo bed . The back seat will accommodate kids , even in a rear-facing baby seat , but it 's not for adults . The four-door Frontier should hit the showrooms next summer for about $ 2,000 more than its King Cab pickup . <p> Sports car rebirth Looking back to design the future has become a popular theme in automotive design . And Nissan designers figure they have the perfect legend to build on . When the company introduced the Datsun 240Z sportscar in 1970 , it became a cultural touchstone . The " Z " as it came to be known lasted 26 years and sold millions . By the early ' 90s , some observers considered the 300ZX the best sports car ever built . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 40,000 . Sales were slow , and Nissan canceled the model . But that meant Nissan lost the car that built its image , and marketing , sales , and profits foundered . Now Nissan hopes to recapture those glory days with a new Z-car , modeled more on the original 240Z than the outgoing 300ZX . The clay in the New York display model was " still warm , " Hirschberg says . Its lines were lifted directly from the original , and it was just one of several designs being considered for a new Z. The price : a nostalgic $ 20,000 to $ 25,000 . Dealers say they want it yesterday . New sedans Nissan displayed other new products in New York , but they seemed less successful . NDI is studying whether traditional sedans can remain viable as baby boomers , accustomed to versatile minivans and SUVs , downsize their family vehicles . Its new concept sedan ( NCS ) borrows heavily from station wagon design , with a cargo area behind the rear seats and a higher rear roof line . But it has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear and a steeply raked rear window , to provide a more formal look than traditional station wagons . The NCS is strictly a concept . In the meantime , Nissan plans to bolster the image of its sedans by styling more of them in the US to cater to American tastes , and by giving its small , medium , and large sedans common styling themes with strong character . For 2000 , the entry-level Sentra will become sleeker and more luxurious , what Hirschberg calls a " destination product " rather than a steppingstone designed to move consumers up to other models . The midsize Altima shows little change , and the large Maxima will regain a sportier flair . Nissan 's successful Quest minivan also gets a face lift and a few new innovations - such as a movable cargo shelf that allows grocery bags to be stacked . When Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler , analysts said it heralded a new wave of mergers in the auto industry , one that could leave Nissan , already spinning its wheels , in an even deeper rut . Some doubted Nissan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak products . Now analysts see hope for Nissan - if only because it 's working on its problems . If merger mania holds off a few more years , Nissan 's product lineup for the next century could take the automotive world by storm . <p> * Comments to : evarts@csmonitor.com
