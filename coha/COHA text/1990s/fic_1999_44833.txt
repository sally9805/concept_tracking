The pertinent question here in Robin Aurelian 's latest sf story appears to be How much do you want ? " The answer , of course , is best left as an exercise for the reader . <p> WOMEN ! WORRIED ? TIRED ? Frustrated ? At a Dead End ? Ready for excitement of a new and different kind ? Send your picture and a brief biography to our catalog . We 'll connect you with someone who can take care of all your needs ! " Sally brushed sweaty bangs off her forehead and blinked a few times to clear her eyes . All around her , dryers and washing machines whirled , chugged , and rattled . The air was full of the clashing scents of different fabric softeners . By the Launderland door , silhouetted against the blazing day outside , two children wrestled over a toy truck and snarled at each other . Sally smoothed the slip of slick white plastic she had found below the detergent dispensing machine and read the ad on it again . It pretty much described her mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her plain white cotton underpants sliding around Norm 's **25;1871;TOOLONG faux-silk boxers . False advertising , at least on his part . There was nothing hot , red , and exciting in Norm 's pants . And he surely generated more than his fair share of work . Sally experienced a stab of fury at Norm 's sweat glands . He could wear things once and they stank for days . Another flare of fury passed through her as she thought about Norm 's ability to tolerate his own odor much longer than Sally could . He was also impervious to dirty dishes and empty ice trays . There had been a time in their relationship when Sally found this endearing . There was so much she could do for him . He needed her . Now she spent a lot of time grinding her teeth . She slipped the strip of plastic into her shorts pocket and forgot about it . Norm brought her roses . She could n't figure out why . A dozen dark red roses : in the humid summer heat of the evening , their heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , six times . Was it their anniversary ? They did n't have a real one . They 'd only been living together a year and a half . Why would he bring her roses ? She leaned over them and sniffed . Rarely did florists " roses have this strong spicy scent . " This is so sweet , Norm , " Sally said . What do you want ? she managed not to say , but she surely thought it loud and clear . What do you want ? What have you done ? What am I supposed to forgive you for ? Norm just smiled and kissed her . " Thanks for everything , honey . You 're wonderful . " Part of her melted into a pool of Silly Putty , and another part maintained its suspicious vigilance . Later , after they had made love and she had the sinking feeling she had now earned those flowers , she lay thinking as Norm slept beside her . Why should she suspect him of something when maybe he was just being nice ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norm just to surprise him ? Did she view everything about their relationship with resentment and suspicion ? Was this what she wanted to do with her life ? Later , when she was gathering up another laundry load from the hamper and found a crumpled shirt of Norm 's with someone else 's perfume on it , despair swamped her . She had n't wanted to be right . She went to a digital photobooth and had a picture made up , herself in a Wanted poster . She wrote a fake biography . " I worked three years as a caboose engineer and six months as a stripper . I did one tour of duty as a mess cook on a submarine . Lately I have made my living having knives thrown at me in a circus act . Magnifico the knife-thrower has only missed once , when he hit me on the inside of my thigh . The scar is quite small , but every time I hear that whish of a knife through air I think it might happen again , and I kind of like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sat and stared at the white plastic strip with the want ad and the address on it . What kind of people put an ad like this on a piece of plastic and stuck it in the launderland ? What sort of answers were they expecting ? What did they do when they got them ? What if it was some weird female slavery thing , or some other kind of scam ? Send us ten thousand dollars and we 'll find your dream lover ? She could always stop before it came to spending money . She could always refuse if some stranger called her up and asked her to meet him alone . Right ? She touched one of last night 's guilt roses , then folded up her photo and bio and put them in an envelope . Address . Stamp . She walked to the mailbox on the comer and hesitated before dropping the envelope in . Really , she had a comfortable life . She worked thirty hours a week at a packing company job where she did n't have to dress in pantyhose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , he was a slob , but his apartment had a nice view of the lake , and his mother almost never visited . What did she have to complain about ? Lots of people would like to have it as good as she had it . The bum at the corner whom she gave fifty cents to most days would probably love this life . Maybe he would get along with Norm better , too . Worried . Tired . Frustrated . At a dead end . Ready for excitement . Sally opened the mailbox and dropped the letter in . Norm answered the call . Sally did n't realize . She was in the kitchen , chopping green peppers and tomatoes for salad when the phone rang . It was usually for him , so she let him pick up . " Oh , really ? " Norm said in the living room . " What gave you that idea ? " And then , a little later , " Oh , really ? " in a voice that wavered between anger and despair . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally put down her knife and stepped out of the kitchen . Norm was flushed , his eyes narrowed . As she watched , his forehead flushed even darker rose . " Where did you - what are you- ? " It came to her suddenly . He had answered the phone , but it was for her , and he was n't going to tell her . She strode across the room and took the phone from him . " Hello ? " " Ah , " said a faintly accented voice , a light honey tenor . " Ms. Sally Norris ? " " That 's right . " " You sent us that delightful response to our request . " " Uh , " said Sally . She had n't planned to pursue this with Norm in the same room . " Is this a bad time ? " " Uh-huh , " Sally said . " Your knifethrower is there , " said the voice . She heard an edge of laughter in it that maybe was n't there . " Uh-huh . " " Would there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Uh-huh . " " Morning ? " " Uh-huh . " " Shall we say , perhaps , ten A.M. ? " " Uh-huh . " " It 's an assignation , then . We greatly enjoyed your bio , Ms. Norris . " " Thanks . " " Ta ta . " " Uh-huh . " Sally hung up the phone . " What the hell is going on here ? " Norm yelled . Sally did n't say much during the fight that followed . Mostly she listened . Norm said all kinds of things that made her wonder how long he had been suspicious of her . Maybe that was why he slept around . He thought she was already doing it . It had never entered her mind . I 'm glad I sent that letter . Sally slept in the living room that night . She tried to convince herself that the convertible sofa was actually comfortable . It did n't work , but she did eventually get a fragment of sleep . Norm was out of the house the next morning without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone to ring . She did n't have to go in to work until one in the afternoon . Ring . " Ms. Norris ? " " Speaking , " she said . This voice was different from the one yesterday . It was a woman . She sounded like she was smiling . " Apple Blossoms Adventures of a Lifetime here , " said the woman 's voice . " Worlds to offer you , no strings attached . " " You mean there are actually positions where my job skills would be useful ? " Sally could n't believe it . Let alone she did n't really have any of the job skills she had described . " We appreciate your spirit , " said the woman . " Are you really , truly fed up with your current position , to the point that you would take a big chance ? " That was the question . How desperate am I ? A sigh whooshed out of her . Sally sat on the sofa , which she had reconverted into a sitting surface . Something bumped her hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with her hairbrush . Among the dishwater blonde strands caught in the bristles , she found three gray hairs , and thought , I could spend the rest of my life here . " I 'm ready , " she told the voice on the phone . " Do you have a lot of material possessions you feel you need to take with you , should you move ? " She thought of the rented storage space where she had put the pieces of her parents " furniture she really liked when they had moved to Florida and wanted to start with all new furnishings in their fabulous new apartment . The set of dishes that had belonged to her grandmother , a few quilts and photo albums . A cardboard box full of her student compositions , going all the way back to the highway-stitched triple-lined paper of first grade . Several boxes of books she had loved but never had time to reread . A woodcarving that had belonged to her grandfather , depicting a red-nosed drunk leaning against a lamppost : when you wound a key in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and whistled , " Did You Ever See a Lassie Go This Way and That ? " She could leave all those things in storage . She glanced around Norm 's apartment . She had clothes and toiletries here , and two houseplants that would die as soon as she left . She had put a Rembrandt print up over the couch when she first moved in , but Norm had moved it to the study , where neither of them ever went . The new towels and washrags she had bought for her and Norm to share ? That one kitchen knife she really liked ? She said , " I do n't have that much stuff , actually . I have some things in storage , but I do n't need them right away . " " We can maintain that account for you indefinitely , " said the woman . Sally said , " I mean , I 'll want them when I get my own house . How long does this job last ? " " A lifetime , if you 're lucky . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " " What kind of work are we talking about ? " " Come in for an interview , Ms. Norris . I promise you 'll find it rewarding . " THE OFFICE was lined with plush : purple on the ceiling , pink on the walls , and crimson on the floor . There were no windows . The furniture looked like fuzzy , pastel-colored mushrooms at various heights . A man and a woman in pale blue pantsuits with high pointed collars sat on two low mushroom-colored mushrooms with a broad , slightly taller taupe mushroom before them , shielding their laps . Two low truffle-brown mushrooms stood in front of the broad one . Sally stood in the oval doorway , wondering why this place looked like a sixties bordello nightmare . The woman smiled at her , and the man beckoned her forward . " Do n't worry , " he said , in that same light tenor , " we do n't bite . " His smile revealed bright flat-edged teeth . Sally looked behind her at the dingy , ordinary corridor of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or receptionist . Talk about fly-by-night . " Is not the contrast amusing ? " asked the woman . " What kind of outfit are you guys running ? " Sally asked . Some cheap stunt ! How could she trust her future to people with taste this bad ? " Our primary headquarters are much better looking , " said the man , smiling . " This is a temporary outpost . " " Uh ... what , exactly , do you do ? " Sally asked . " We find people ready to have adventures , and then we supply the adventures ! " said the woman . Her green gaze and warm tone mesmerized Sally in a snaky way . " We have an adventure specially selected for you already , though your advantage profile is so high we could find more than one suitable destination for you . Are you ready for a whole ... new ... life ? " She sounded like a preacher who had reached the sermon 's punchline . " What ? " " Just say yes , " the man said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ! " " Who are you people ? What kind of con game are you running ? " " There 's nothing phony about what we 're doing , " said the man . " We match people with adventure . That 's all there is to it ! " " People ? The ad said women , " Sally said . She chewed her lower lip , then stepped all the way into the room . A door slid out of the wall and whooshed shut , just like the ones on Star Trek . It was covered with lavender plush and had no handle . She stepped toward it . It did n't whoosh open again . She glanced over her shoulder at the smiling man and woman . " Have a seat , " the man suggested gently . Well , those two would have to leave sometime . They would have to open the door . She would get out . Still , she felt totally trapped . She went over and sat on one of the mushrooms . It was warm and bent gently under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly solid warm water . " Sally , " said the woman , " the truth is , we are recruiting only women . Women have the qualities we need . " " What exactly does that mean ? " Sally shifted , and the mushroom conformed to her new position . Comfortable but unnerving . " We 'll tell you more when you 're committed to your new life ! " the woman said . " Oh , no , you do n't , " Sally protested . " I 'm not saying yes to anything without reading the fine print . " The man smiled forlornly at her , blinked suddenly tear-brimmed eyes . " Well , we 'll have to say good-bye , then . Such a shame . You 're an excellent prospect for the highest grade adventure we offer . " Sally struggled to her feet . " Where did you get this furniture ? " she asked . She wished she had mushrooms like this at home , no matter how tacky they looked . " You ca n't get that around here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the living quarters where you would have been going . " " Too bad , " Sally said . She had been wondering if a bed made out of a giant mushroom would feel like this , and imagining rolling around on one with Norm . She headed for the door . If it would just open as she approached , this could make an okay exit . Woman acts in her own best interests . Period . " There 's nothing more you can tell me ? " she asked , turning back . " Where I want to send you , " said the woman , " you would have servants to take care of all household chores , access to your favorite foods , literature , television programs , and movies , and all the furniture acts like these comfichairs . " " How can I be sure you 're telling the truth ? " " You ca n't , " said the man . " You 'll have to trust your instincts . " Her instincts had led her to Herb , and Jacob , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling ice trays and cleaning shaving stubble out of sinks and waking up to find she was in the wrong place with the wrong person again . Some instincts . Then again , what else did she have to work with ? She stared at the man and woman . Studied their strange pantsuits . Not from around here , she thought . Definitely . What kind of material was that , slick and shiny but not exactly vinyl ? Were the man 's eyes really silver ? Did the woman 's skin have a faint green tinge to it ? That spot in the middle of her forehead : megazit or vestigial third eye ? Why was the man hiding his hands under the big mushroom ? " How much torture and pain is involved in this job ? " Sally asked . " How much do you want " asked the woman . The man went back to Norm 's apartment with Sally after she had set her hand on some slick flesh-colored surface that the woman called a contract . " Just point to anything you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the stereo for a minute . Technically , it was Norm 's , but she used it a lot more than he did . " Do n't worry about that , " said the man . " You 'll have a much better sound system , and access to almost everything ever recorded in any medium . " " Cool , " said Sally . She took him to the bedroom and started to pull her clothes down from the hangers . He fingered a pink summer dress with a small stain on the front . " Do you really want this ? " " I have to have clothes . " " Just take a few things . You 'll get a whole new and more appropriate wardrobe when you get there . What do you have here that 's really meaningful to you , that you 'd feel heartsick if you lost , that you ca n't live without ? " In the end Sally had a small stack that included sixteen hardback books , the contents of the spice cabinet , assorted packets of tea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Will I be able to get Pantene Pro-V conditioning shampoo there ? " " Take a sample with you , " he said . " They 'll synthesize it . You might find you like the local product more . " Her little jewelry box , with its few bits of gold and silver and the small diamond ring her father had given her for her sixteenth birthday ; her camera and three rolls of outdated film ; a stuffed teddy bear a boy had won for her at a carnival when she was fourteen ; the six diaries she had actually written in scattershot across the years . Sally studied her possessions . " It 's pathetic , is n't it ? " " It 's perfect , " he said . He took a small copper device out of a pocket in his pantsuit , held it up in front of his eye as though it were a camera , and clicked something . Her whole collection of life glowed and shrank until it could all fit into a quart-size Ziploc bag . He took out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , then sealed it shut . " Ba-ba-but - " He handed her the bag . " Hang onto this . When you get to your new posting , they 'll have an enlarging ray there . Do n't worry about breaking anything . Shrinks and protects . " HE WAS WAITING when she stepped out of the shuttle onto the sparkling green pavement of the terminal . He had three stumpy legs and six or eight tentacular arms , and his head was covered with a forest of thinner , longer tentacles that rose and pointed their sucker-dotted tips toward her . Two of his eyes lit up when he saw her ; the other five shifted color . She did n't yet know what this meant . For a moment she stood , hugging herself and shivering , even though the air was dense , damp , and warm . She had learned his language and customs through sleep induction on the journey here , but she did n't want to chance the first word . What if she got it wrong ? " You 're everything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then wondered if that was an acceptable expression here . Then took the next six steps toward him and stood quietly while he folded his arms around her . " Natomis , " she said . His name . Just tell me that you 're not the next Norm , she thought . He lifted her and walked , stump stump stump , out of the terminal , carrying her above his head like a trophy . Others " head tentacles turned to study her , and she heard a flow of subsonics in the air around her - men language , which she had not been taught . She watched colors shift across her new man 's skin , wondered if they were pride-sign colors . Sometimes he turned her this way and that in front of another of his kind , and the subsonics intensified . She smiled and smiled without showing teeth , and listened for the whish of the next knife flying through air .
