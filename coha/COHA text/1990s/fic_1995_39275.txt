" We must go deeper , " Cousteau says . He is haggard , worn to bone , his splendid Gallic nose a wedge driven into his face . He uses his utensils to illustrate  --  his fork has become a crane , his spoon the diving machine , a pool of sauce the ocean . I feel the ship roll under my feet , an undulation as gentle as a breath . <p> " Mais oui " a chorus of voices sings out . " Deeper " <p> I 'm working my way round the cramped table , pouring coffee into a desolation of plates , cutlery , crusts of bread and fish bones . " But why ? " I hear myself asking . " Have n't we gone deep enough ? What crime have we committed that we do n't deserve to see a port , a tree , the inside of a good brasserie ? " <p> Twenty pairs of eyes settle on me . I can see that this last bit about the brasserie is having its effect . Cousteau glances up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " until I see with my own two eyes what lies on the bottom . Who knows what miracles will be revealed , what kaleidoscopic vistas of the unknown and silent world ? " <p> I bite my tongue , though I could say plenty . Cousteau is getting old . We 're all getting old . We 've plumbed every body of water on earth , from McMurdo Sound to the Arafura Sea and the Firth of Clyde , we 've found every wreck and frolicked with every fish , and I just do n't see the point of it anymore . But Cousteau is the perennial Boy Scout , intoxicated with adventure , if nor the cru bourgeois the Calypso carries in her three-ton stainless steel wine tank . For him , everything is " kaleidoscopic , " " dreamlike , " " phantasmagoric , " from the life of the coral reef to the dregs of vin rouge left in the bottom of his glass after dinner . The whole watery world is his to embrace , but for me it 's the galley and the galley only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chops and limp vegetables and nothing but poisson , poisson , poisson . Twenty ravenous gastronomes stare up at me from the table each night , and what do i have to offer them ? Poisson . <p> The first to break the silence is Saout . He has bags under his eyes , and his chest , once sculpted and firm with his years of manhandling winches and hawsers , droops like an old woman 's . " Bernard has a point , " he says . " We 've gone over two months now without liberty . " <p> " Two months without women , " Didier growls . <p> " Or meat , " Sancerre puts in . <p> I try to keep from smirking as I lean over the sun-blasted nape of this man or that to pour my bitter black brew . But Cousteau is oblivious . He merely waves the lank flap of his hand and says , " Deeper . " <p> We are anchored  --  have been anchored for two months now and counting  --  some 160 miles off the coast of West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intents and purposes has no bottom . Sense and sonar indicate that it is there , somewhere between thirteen and fourteen thousand feet , but because of poor maneuverability , undersea mudslides and senile dementia on the part of captain and crew , we have been unable to locate it . As if it matters . As if we have n't already sounded out the sterile bottoms of a hundred canyons just like it and found absolutely nothing that would change anyone 's life one way or the other . The usual complement of scientists is aboard , of course , eager boyish men with pinched features , oversized eyeglasses , clipboards and calculators . They ate geniuses . Learned professors . World-renowned authorities on the sponge or the sea cucumber . Tant pis . To me they are simply mouths to feed , mouths that tighten perceptibly at the mention of fish . <p> I am up , as always , an hour before dawn , preparing breakfast . I still have flout  --  thank God for that or we 'd have a full-scale mutiny on our hands  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself absently filling them with artificial pastry creme and the obscenely flavorless pulp of defrosted strawberries , but what can I do ? Even the batter is bastardized , the eggs produced from a tin in the form of a noxious yellow powder that looks like something you 'd use in a chemistry experiment . What I would n't give for a dozen fresh eggs . Half a dozen . Merde : even a single one . But of course there arc no chicken houses on the open sea . <p> Busy with my whisk , I fail to notice Sancerre creeping into the galley . I hear him before I see him . " Who 's there ? " I demand , the portholes black with the vestiges of yet another night at sea , the ship undulating beneath my feet in an incipient morning swell . <p> Sheepish , the sleep still glued to his eyes , Sancerre emerges from the pool of shadow behind the deep freeze . " Me , " he says simply . <p> " What are you doing here ? " <p> I watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the galley lights , a face yellowed by the shambling years and the hostility of the sun . He shuffles his big feet , drops his shoulders and spreads his hands wide . " I 'm hungry , " he says . <p> " Hungry , eh " <p> My first impulse is to toy with him , make him squirm a bit , offer to perhaps fry up a batch of the flying fish that lie stunned on the deck each morning . Fish is n't what he wants . He wants sausage , cheese , croissants pregnant with butter , he wants cold chicken , thick slices of Bayonne ham , beefsteaks and pate maison spread on crusty rounds of peasant bread . Yes , of course , but he too must suffer through this hell of fish . <p> " A little something would do , " he says almost apologetically . " Just a bite to settle the stomach . " <p> And in that moment , even before I reach for the smoked sausage I keep hidden behind the saucepans , I realize I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked away , down goes the bathyscaphe , accompanied partway by the soucoupe plongeante  --  our diving saucer  --  and all hands are hungrily occupied till lunch . Cousteau himself is piloting the bathyscaphe , though he 's too old to sit for hours in the moist cramped bubble of steel and glass down there in the ultimate hole of the earth , too old by far , just as I 'm too old to prepare fillets of loup de mer in this straitjacket of a galley or ladle scalding chaudree from the pot in an unsettled sea  --  and I have the scars to prove it . One of the scientists has gone down with him , an American with big American teeth and a braying American laugh that makes me want to kill every time I hear it . His very name  --  Dr. Mazzy Gort  --  sticks in my throat . I wish no one harm , but sometimes I fantasize . What if Cousteau and Dr. Mazzy Gort never come up again ? What if the lifeline fails or a mudslide buries them two miles down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever ? It 's an evil thought . But it 's not my first , nor , I suspect , will it be my last . <p> For lunch I serve a grouper Falco speared last night . I 've taken some care with it , marinated the fine white flesh in olive oil and fennel  --  the last of my fennel  --  and a soupcon of pastis . I serve it with fresh bread , the remaining potatoes and defrosted green beans in an explosion of aromas , pretending , for all and sundry , that this is not fish at all , that this is not the open sea , that we are not prisoners of Cousteau 's madness . And what do I get for it ? <p> Saout : " Oh , merde , not fish again . " <p> Piccard : " What else ? " <p> Sancerre : " I want my mother . " <p> Didier : " I want a whore . Two whores . One for this  --  and one for this . " ( A manual demonstration , very nimble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and afternoon dives , I find my feet directing me to the main deck and the cabin Cousteau used to share with his wife , back in the days when we were young and such things mattered . I am thinking . Talking to myself , actually . Making speeches . In one of the rear compartments of my brain , uninfected by the primordial reek of the sea and the visible evidence of the portholes , is the image of a modest auberge in Cluny or Trevoux , a tasteful little place that specializes in country dishes , viands mostly , heavy on cassoulets , game and sweetbreads , though perhaps , after a year or two on dry land , the chef might consider adding a pike quenelle or a truite aux amandes to the bill of fare . In the forefront of my consciousness an argument simmers for Cousteau . <p> Jacques-Yves , mon vieux , be reasonable , I will tell him . We are out of butter , eggs , cream , vegetables and herbs , we have less than a gallon of olive oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onions or potatoes . Release us . Release me . I 'm fed up . Thirty years of clinging to the drainboard while the sea jerks my feet out from under me , thirty years of dicing leeks on a counter that wo n't stand still , thirty years of racking my brain to come up with new ways and yet more new ways to prepare fish , and I 've had it . I want to retire . I want to cook for tourists and the petite bourgeoisie . I want to cook meat , I want an herb garden and a chicken house . I want to feel the earth under my feet . <p> This is my speech , the one gathering itself on my lips as I seek out Cousteau . Unfortunately , I never get to deliver it . Because by the time I get to Cousteau 's cabin and stick my head in the door , he is lost to me , lost to us all , as faraway as if he were on another ship off another coast . The portholes are smothered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ritual of the voice-over . He sits before the m monitor , a weird greenish glow on his face , mesmerized by images of the sea . Nothing moves but his lips , his voice murmurous and rapt : " As we go deeper into the somnolent depths , a kaleidoscope of fishes whirling round us like painted stars in a night sky , we can not help but wonder at the phantasmagoric marvels that await us below . . . " <p> That evening , as the grouper appears in the guise of a saffronless bouillabaisse that is short on all ingredients except fish , Sancerre takes me aside . We are in the galley , the ship tolling in a moderate-to-heavy swell , the crew loud and raucous in the main cabin . His skin is the color of a baked yam , his eyes sunk deep in his head . " Bernard , " he says , lowering his voice to a whispery rasp , " I 've been talking to some of the men . . . " <p> The pans rattle . A knife shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . I grab hold of the counter to keep from pitching face forward into the dessert . " Yes ? " I prompt . <p> Sancerre 's face is like an old boot . The swell does n't fate him  --  he might as well be a fly clinging to the wall . " We want to go home , " he says finally . <p> Relief washes over me . I can feel the tears coming to my eyes as I take the blistered hide of Sancerre 's hand in mine and give it an affirmative squeeze . " Me too , " I say , " me too , " and I can hardly contain my emotion . <p> Sancerre glances over his shoulder , furtive and sly , then comes back to me with a wink . " We were just thinking , " he whispers , and it 's a strain to hear him over the habitual roar of the sea and the brouhaha of the crew at their sorry dinner , " about what you said last night over coffee , standing up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port , then jerks back at the long leash of its anchor , which is mired in the muck on top of a submerged mountain five hundred feet down . " Yes , " I say , afraid of moving too fast , afraid of scaring him off , " go on . " <p> But he just shrugs , the big idiot , and jams his hands into his pockets even as the swell rocks the deck under his feet . <p> " Listen , " I say , " Sancerre , old friend , could you find room for another little morsel of sausage ? And some cheese I 've been saving  --  some Gruyere ? " <p> Sancerre 's eyes leap at me like caged beasts . The ship heaves back again and there 's a sharp curse from the main cabin followed by the sound of breaking glass . " Cheese ? Did you say cheese ? " <p> I am expansive , generous to a fault . Not only do I break out the cheese and sausage but two neat little glasses of the culinary pastis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated side by side atop the deep freeze like two old cronies on a country picnic . I wait till he 's wolfed down half a dozen wedges of the Gruyere and three plump slices of sausage before I say anything , and when I say it I am already pouting his second glass full to the brim with the clear fragrant liquor . " How many of you are in on it ? " I whisper . <p> " Six of us , " he says before he can think . <p> " And the American ? " <p> A look of disgust creeps across his features , settling finally into the ropy bulge of his lower lip . " The American , " he spits , and I know exactly what he means : if push comes to shove , the American will have to be sacrificed , along with anyone else who gets in our way . <p> " Falco ? " I ask . <p> " He 's with the Captain , you should know that . They 're like two peas in a pod . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat rocking under my feet ? Are we really sitting here in the galley over a bottomless pit in a rolling swell , contemplating mutiny ? The thought thrills me till I feel as if I 've been rung like a bell . Strange to say , though , I 'm not thinking of Cousteau or fathomless depths or crashing waves or even courts of inquiry , but of forest mushrooms  --  forest mushrooms growing in sweet pale clumps among the ferns in a deep pool of shade . <p> It is then that Saout slips in the door with his old woman 's tits and a broken plate held out conspicuously before him , looking secretive , looking like a spy  --  or a conspirator . His eyes take in the scene and without a word he goes straight for the sausage . One bite , two : he does n't bother with the knife . I watch his jaws work around the bleached-out bristle of his beard . The ship lurches , but he 's glued to the floor . " Are you with us ? " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ship comes back up and shakes itself like an old dog emerging from a bath , I can only nod . <p> In the morning , though it hurts me to do it , though it goes against every principle I 've held sacrosanct since I successfully reduced my first bearnaise some forty years ago , I serve a breakfast even an American would n't eat . The coffee  --  strained through yesterday 's grounds  --  is the color of turpentine , watery and thin and without benefit of cream . There is no bread . Instead of baking , I make use of the old crusts I 've been saving for croutons , dipping them in a paste made of powdered egg and water and then frying them hard in twice-used oil and serving them with an accompaniment of flying fish poached in sea water and nothing else , not even a dash of pepper o a pass of the bouquet garni . I feel like an imp , a demon , a saboteur . I set out the plates in the main cabin , ring the breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounding in my chest . <p> It does n't take long . The rumble outrage spreads through the ship like some seismic event , radiating outward from the epicenter of the main cabin till every last bolt and iron plate thrums with it . I 'm taking a calculated risk , and I know it . For the moment , at least , the gastronomic outrage is directed at me , and I 'm not surprised when fifteen minutes late a deputation of the crew seeks me out in my bunk . It is led by Piccard and one of the scientists  --  Laffite , the sponge man  --  but to my relief , as I look up long-faced from my pillow , I see that Sancerre and Saout are hovering protectively in the background . <p> " What 's the matter with you , Bernard ? " Piccard demands . " Are you sick , is that it ? Dizzy spells again ? " <p> The sponge man is more direct : " How could you serve such , such "  --  he 's so overwrought he can barely get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing short of criminal . " <p> I gaze up at them with a composed face , calm as the sacrificial lamb . " Sick , yes , " I say . " But not in the body  --  in my heart . " <p> Laffite is a bomb choking on its own fuse . He is a big man , bloated with his cravings , a priest worshipping at the temple of the gustatory pleasures . " What the hell is that supposed to mean ? " he cries . " Get out of that bed , you slacker , you assassin " <p> Fortunately , Saout is able to wrestle hold of his arms , or the first blood might have been spilled right then and there  --  and it would have been mine . " Calm yourself , Laffite , " he growls , and only I detect the quick slice of his wink . I let my eyes fall shut , and the sea , quiet now , rocks me in my cradle . A minute passes , the four of them squabbling like schoolchildren , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But my ears deceive me : when I open my eyes I see that Sancerre has stayed behind . He is grinning , and his jaundiced face seems to be lit from within , glowing like a freshly picked lemon . " We are eight , " he whispers , and I give him a look . Who ? I silently mouth . <p> Sancerre glances over his shoulder . " It 's all a charade , " he says . " Piccard has capitulated . " <p> Lunch is a triumph of negativity : the selfsame flying fish , baked to the texture of wood pulp , their veiny winglike fins dried to stumps and served in a crimson jacket of American catsup , with canned niblet corn and sweet gherkins desecrating the rest of the plate under a garnish of seaweed . Again I retreat to my berth , again an incensed mob seeks me out . This time Sancerre shepherds Borchardt , Pepin and Fasquelle into my presence , and by the time they leave , we are eleven . <p> And then the piece de resistance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket to freedom : dinner . During the course of the afternoon , Cousteau and Dr. Mazzy Gort have descended again , ever deeper , seeking their solutions in the eternal muck . The crew has worked doggedly beneath an unsympathetic sun , their wizened biceps and arthritic backs straining , stomachs rumbling , the taste of mutiny burning like some bitter potion in their throats . And I ? I have made my slow deliberate way through the reefs and shoals of my saucepans , my cruets , my knives and sieves and whisks . For the first time in as long as I can remember , I am working from a recipe , a curiosity from a thin volume left behind ten or fifteen years ago by a scientist from a place called Missouri : The Show Me State Cookbook . I do not have the butter , the creme fraiche , the milk , the champignons or the Parmesan , but the tinned tuna , the yellow wax beans and the packets of egg noodles exist in a sedimentary layer at the very bottom of the larder in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't want to spoil the thing with any hint of flavor , after all . The sun slides across the porthole . <p> whistle while I work . <p> It is past seven by the time the bathyscaphe is back on deck and Cousteau and Dr. Mazzy Gort have extricated their cramped limbs from its bowels . The crew steps lively , working furiously to secure everything against the night , lurching across the deck on aching feet , their noses turned optimistically to the air in the hope of catching a whiff of what the prandial hour promises to bring them . I overhear snatches of conversation , Cousteau 's voice raised in giddy triumph  --  they 've found something , but not the bottom , not yet - and as the sun swells on the horizon the first cigarettes are lit , the first glasses of wine circulated . This is the hour when an air of festivity prevails aboard the Calypso , a time when labors are set aside and the mind drifts toward the simple pleasures to come . And so it is tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ float in through the open porthole and as this man or that sticks his head in the galley for a premonitory sniff , I can sense the tension underlying it all , the nasty nagging collective memory of that unforgivable breakfast and the obscenity of a lunch that followed it . They tread lightly . They are afraid . Deeply afraid . <p> This time I stand my ground . With a grand flourish I set the three big steaming pans down in the center of the table for each man to serve himself : the moment of truth is at hand . I note the sly , guilty looks of my co-conspirators as they suck at their wine glasses like condemned men , resigned to going hungry , and it props up my resolve . A lull falls over the conversation , hands fiddling with cutlery , with napkins , reaching out for the saltshaker , the pepper , the quietly oozing pans of my chef d'oeuvre . And now I have eyes only for the head of the table , where Cousteau sits absorbed in talk of the deeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retract unconsciously into the shells of their bent heads and bunched shoulders ; their noses sniff the air warily . Steam rises . The first pan is breached , then the second and third , and all but the conspirators dig in . <p> Laffite is the first to react . " Good Christ " he explodes , coughing up a mouthful of the stuff . <p> " I 'm poisoned " gasps Falco ; and all round the table men lurch back from their plates in shock and horror . Even the captain , whose taste buds must have withered and died long ago , lifts his head to give me a look of astonishment . Only Mazzy Gort seems unaffected , feeding the mucilaginous paste into the slot of his mouth as unconcernedly as if he were at a hot dog stand in some fantastical place like Peoria or Oshkosh . <p> Through the general tumult that ensues , one voice begins to take command : Laffite 's . " Murderer " he cries , leaping from his seat in a frenzy . " And what do you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a rod , a pillar , the statue of a man in a crisp white toque , arms folded across my chest . " Tuna noodle casserole , " I announce , and the place erupts . <p> Later , after the walls of the main cabin have been scrubbed down and the belligerents separated and sent wheezing to their bunks , Sancerre appears in the doorway to the galley to inform me that the captain would like to have a word with me . Poor Sancerre . His dried yellow fig of a face is as mournful as a Greek mask , but his bloodied nose and the flapping rags of his eyes show that he is n't licked yet . " What happened ? " I ask , not bothering to look up of offer him a portion of the sausage I 'm feeding into my mouth , one compulsive slice after another . " I thought you said we were eleven ? " <p> " Son of a bitch , " he mutters . " It was Piccard . Did you see him ? " <p> Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight broke out , and when the food began to fly it was n't Cousteau who took the brunt of the abuse , but me , as if everything I 'd done was n't for the general good and benefit of all . " What next ? " I want to know , my voice a miserable croak . " I 've given it everything I have . " <p> Framed in the doorway like some ghost of the larder , Sancerre replies in a voice as miserable as mine . " Give it time , " he says . " The men ca n't hold out much longer . They ca n't . " He steps closer , eyeing my sausage , his hands spread wide in extenuation . " They 're sucking on hard candy and drinking wine like it was gravy , they 're cracking jars of peanuts , raiding the emergency supplies in the lifeboats . They 're in an ugly mood , Bernard . I tell you , if it was n't for the wine  --  " <p> Suddenly we lock eyes . The wine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread and he is angry , deny him his foie gras and his truffles and he is savage , but deny him his wine and he is nothing short of homicidal . Sancerre is grinning , and his grin has a country village in it , a kitchen garden , fruit tees , rabbits on a hook . I am grinning too , and my grin contains all that and more . " The wine , " I repeat , and though Cousteau awaits and my stomach plunges and everywhere the stink of fish infests my nostrils , I find myself laughing , laughing till the tears begin to stream down my face . <p> " Bernard , " Cousteau intones , and there is nothing left of his face but nose and two huge and liquidly suffering eyes , " I am chagrined . And puzzled too . It almost seems as if you 're deliberately trying to provoke the crew . " <p> We are in Cousteau 's cabin , a dark void rocking on the night of the sea and lit only by the subaquatic glow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish appear . Coral . The deeps . There is a plea on my tongue , a plea for our thirty years , for understanding and compassion , a mon vieux and a mon ami , but I kill it . " That 's right , " I say . " I am . " <p> " But what are you thinking ? " Here the nose becomes a slash of shadow , the eyes luminous with the reflection of the screen  --  in this moment he looks like nothing so much as a fish . <p> " Do n't you realize that we 've almost reached our objective ? " <p> " I do n't care . " <p> " Do n't care ? But what of the kaleidoscopic wonders , what of the fishes in their undersea grottoes ? " <p> The sea is calm , the ship motionless beneath us , held fast in a liquid vise . " I 'm too old for exploring , " I say finally . " My feet hurt . There are no more wonders for me . " I look him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last meal aboard this ship . " <p> And now the look of surprise , of consternation , of a befuddlement so deep you would have thought I was a talking eel or a puffer fish reciting La Nymphe de la Seine . " But you ca n't do that  --  you 've signed the articles . I 'd have to , to put you in chains . . . " <p> I feel myself giving way  --  I ca n't take this anymore , not another minute . I spit my words out , vomit them up , and I do n't care , I do n't . " Spanish rice " I shout . " Chuck Wagon Beans , Tuna Surprise , macaroni and cheese " <p> And so , the next morning , as dawn breaks over the sea , I find myself confined to quartets , Laffite , the sponge man , standing guard over me as if I were some shipwrecked loon or common provocateur . I can smell from afar the sordid amateur attempts at breakfast , the blackened and fallen bread , the ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the farce of his pistol , his heavy face drawn with hunger and fatigue . " What would you give , Laffite , " I say , as the morning swell drops us into a trough and buffets us back up again , " for a nice crisply presented Caneton Tour d'Argent or a Filet de boeuf en croute ? Eh ? How many baskets of your precious sponges ? Or would you prefer to eat them ? " <p> The big man , with his big head and suffering eyes , looks queasy . " I warn you , " he says , and he clutches at the pistol with fat sweating fingers . <p> " Remember the petites brioches I used to make in the mornings , still hot from the oven ? The way the butter would sink into them ? Or the pain de campagne , a loaf per man ? " <p> " Madman , " he snarls . " Fiend . Shut up " <p> But I go on and on till he 's at the breaking point , till he 's either going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let me climb above decks and guide the misguided . He 's giving way , I can see it , but then , right in the middle of my loving recreation of the recipe for Roast Leg of Venison with Poivrade Sauce , there 's a shout from above followed almost immediately by the most piteous outpouring of shock and lament I 've ever heard . Laffite drops the pistol as if it 's suddenly come to life and we leap simultaneously to our feet and fling ourselves out the door and up the companionway . A moment later , out of breath , we emerge on deck to a scene of purgatorial despair . Borchardt is beating his head against the rail , Falco striding up and down the boards shouting " All hands on deck , " Piccard hiding his face and weeping like a schoolgirl . The Captain and Dr. Mazzy Gort , huddled by the bathyscaphe in their deep-sea explorer 's costumes , can only blink and stare  --  they could n't look any more confused if the ship had hit a reef . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep red stain , a stain that might have been the life 's blood of a hundred crews , already paling to dissolution in the brine . I look to Sancerre and his reckless smile , to Saout and his suicidal eyes , and I know that this is not blood , but wine , cru bourgeois , five hundred gallons at least . The voyage is over . The bottom will remain inviolate , the fishes undisturbed . Cousteau is defeated . <p> It is my moment , and I seize it . " Rally round , men " I cry , my heart contracting like a fist . " Weigh anchor We 're going home " <p> No one moves . The wind lifts the hair over our ears , the wine-dark sea heaves at the hull . All eyes turn to Cousteau . Wearily , sunk into the pouches and wrinkles of his obsession , he takes a step forward and bums us all with his eyes . " Deeper , " he says " we must go deeper . " <p> Falco is the first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreadable , he breaks ranks with the men to stride across the deck and stand with the Captain . Dr. Mazzy Gort is next . He looks from Falco to Cousteau and then to the rest of us and ca n't suppress a whinny of apprehension : he may be an American , but he can see what 's coming . " It 's all over " I shout . " Give it up " <p> Cousteau ignores me . He just pulls on his hood and thermal jacket and climbs into the bathyscaphe , that fat sputnik of the deeps suspended from the crane at the stern of the ship . I can see him there , in hawkish profile , fiddling with the controls through the rictus of the open door . He gestures impatiently to Mazzy Gort , but the American hesitates , and in the moment of his hesitation Falco moves to the Captain 's side , disappearing aloft in the shadow of the diving capsule . The steel doors crank shut . <p> It 's up to me now . Up to me to order the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yawning mouth of the waves , up to me to cut the throats of thirty individual years , one by one , as cleanly and surely as I cut the lifeline with a torch and insure , once and for all , that Cousteau finds what he 's seeking . For a moment the responsibility paralyzes me . The men  --  Sancerre , Saout , Piccard , even Laffite and Dr. Mazzy Gort  --  watch me in silence , hardly daring to swallow . And then the breeze shifts direction , carrying all the way out from some distant shore , a breeze smelling impossibly of pork roast , of beef , of goose and quail and duck a l'orange , and I know I can do anything , anything at all . <p>
