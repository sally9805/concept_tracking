SARAH CROUCHES BESIDE THE tide pool , her water bottle beside her knee . She tugs the brim of her straw hat , tucking a lock of her brown hair under its band , and smooths the sleeves of her cotton blouse in hopes they will help protect her from the sun . An hour 's exposure , wearing a forty-two sun block , is considered an acceptable risk for people in their twenties ; Sarah is thirty-seven . She glances over her shoulder at the expanse of yellow sand stretching behind her , at her footprints wandering in and out of the surf . No one in sight . Only fools risk the late May sun at noon  --  fools and desperate people . <p> She hesitates , then dips her hand beneath the surface of the tide pool , bracing herself against the chill . But there is no chill , just the coolness of the water as it chums briefly with the runoff of a wave . She makes a mental note to record this observation when she returns to her lab , then remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She squints down the beach . Where is he ? <p> She turns back to the pool . Framed by algae and rock , the tidal world shimmers below her . A hermit crab , startled by Sarah 's shadow and her hand , scuttles into a protective niche between two green anemones . The pool drains . Exposed to the air , the anemones squeeze shut so that they look like plastic tubes with tufts of yam sticking out . A decorator crab heads for a fissure , its shell drably ornamented with barnacles , a tiny anemone and a fringe of algae . Mussels and starfish cling to the rock . Sarah smiles wistfully . She had n't really expected to see a nudibranch in the narrow pool . <p> On a Sunday morning in February , Sarah unlocked.her lab and found a stranger waiting for her , bent over the aquarium . He straightened , towering over her five feet . " What are you doing here ? " she demanded . <p> The tall man tapped the aquarium wall . The security badge clipped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They look like slugs . " <p> " Please do n't tap the glass , " Sarah said , grasping his hand between her thumb and her index finger . She guided his hand away from the glass , then dropped it . <p> The man folded his lean body into a crouch . The shadows of the aquarium bubbles played across his features , across the broad cheeks and the nose flattened as if pressed against invisible glass . " I ca n't believe how many requisitions you 've put in for these things . " <p> Sarah fisted her hands and scratched her palms with her fingernails . " I use them in my research . " <p> The man turned , watching her for a second . " I make you nervous . " <p> " Strangers in my lab always make me nervous . " <p> The man stood . He stroked the base of the STM settled on the counter next to the aquarium . " Dr. Huron , I 'm hardly a stranger  --  well , not to the company . " Heextendeda hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She shook his hand , then pulled her own away . <p> " You 're developing an artificial skin , " he said . <p> She leaned against the far counter , pressing against it as if she could embed herself into the pine cabinets . " An organic skin , to replace damaged skin , " she said . <p> " And a temporary one people can apply instead of sunscreen , " Jason Whitcomb said . He pursed his lips . " You know , I 've found that a lot of researchers have a personal motive behind their work . What about you ? What would this skin allow you to do that , say , a sunscreen would n't ? Swim ? " <p> Sarah studied him ; she did n't trust him , not with knowledge as personal as her mother 's cancer . " Swim , yes . And I , uh , I miss visiting the tide pools at Thieves ' Point . " <p> " Thieves ' Point. ? " <p> " I used to go there a lot as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to think or when I 'm stressed . " <p> He nodded , eyebrows raised . " I understand your research is coming along very well . " <p> Sarah reached behind to steady herself . Her fingers tightened on the lip of the steel sink . " My project is classified . " <p> " I have top security clearance . " <p> " You have n't proved that , your clearance . " <p> He smiled ; a broad grin further flattened his nose and narrowed his gray eyes . " No , I guess I have n't , " he said . He unclipped his badge and handed it to her . She scrutinized it , then handed it back . <p> " Why so many nudibranchs ? " he said . <p> " I like them . Each species is different . Each has its own defense . " <p> " You like that . " <p> " Everything should have a defense , " Sarah said softly . <p> STILL AND quiet , Sarah watches the tide pool . Her knees are a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , avoiding the sharp edges of the mussels and barnacles . A wave breaks over the far rocks in a plume of spray , the froth surging to beat against the outcrop where Sarah waits . It sluices into her tide pool , washing over the anemones so that they bloom into mums of tiny , undulating fingers . Timidly , the hermit crab creeps from between their stalks . <p> Sarah exclaims and leans forward . The hermit crab 's shell glistens , as black as Richard 's eyes . <p> Sarah looked anywhere but at Jason Whitcomb as he spoke . Her gaze traveled the lab : a fifty-gallon tank of nudibranchs , two STMs with fractal display screens , a multitude of cupboards , clean white counters , the coffin-shaped glass flotation tank , the refrigeration room . And that was just what she could see . Behind the counter and cupboards where Jason Whitcomb perched sat the Mitsubishi molecular computer , laser diode spectrometer , a centrifuge surrounded by rows of test tubes and pipettes ; beyond that a door leading to a hall lined with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment . <p> The only world Sarah knew . <p> "  --  is vital to the company , " Jason Whitcomb said . " We need that skin to keep us afloat  --  keep us competitive . Dr. Huron ? " <p> Sarah blinked , turned to meet his gaze . " Mr. Whitcomb ? " <p> " Jason , please , " he said . <p> Sarah nodded absently . <p> " Anyway , as you know there has been maximum security around your project  --  " <p> " What do you want from me ? " <p> " Sarah  --  " <p> " Dr. Huron , please . " <p> He pursed his lips . " Dr. Huron , " he said distinctly . " One of our competitors , Hansen Biomedicals , is on the verge of developing their own arti  --  uh , ' organic ' skin , despite the fact that a year ago they had no such project on record . " <p> Sarah shook her head . " If they can create an organic skin , more power to them . Without it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . What we 're talking about is survival , Mr. Whitcomb . " <p> " Jason . " He straightened . With his shoulders squared , he looked even more threatening . " Yes , Dr. Huron . Survival . The survival of this company . And , need I say it ? The survival of your research . " <p> Sarah looked away . <p> " If Hansen succeeds first , " he said coolly , " MediChem has no reason to fund your research . MediChem would probably be forced to shut down your lab . " <p> Sarah winced as her stomach clenched . <p> " What we want from you is a skin , one that can secrete a toxin that will kill anyone the wearer touches . " <p> Sarah 's mouth went dry . " My God . " <p> " Just like the nudibranch that dissolves its enemy . " Jason 's voice softened . He tapped at the aquarium again . " Which one is it ? The pinkish , ragged one ? Or that yellow one ? " <p> Sarah held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . " <p> " Sure you can , " Jason said . " You 've already made a prototype skin . Now you just create one with microscopic glands that secrete a neurotoxin . One that can be released at will . " <p> " I ca n't . " <p> " You like your job , do n't you , Dr. Huron ? But you must . You spend all of your time here . You have no friends outside this building , no one you spend time with . . . . " <p> Sarah 's hands tightened on the counter . " Did it ever occur to you what the neurotoxin might do to the wearer ? " <p> He shook his head . " The nudibranch does n't die . Why should the assassin ? You can insure that , Sarah . " <p> Her stomach knotted . " I do n't want to see my research used  --  Who are you planning to . . . ? " <p> " Someone who used to work here . Someone who took classified documents to Hansen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her temples , trying to ease the sudden pounding in her head . " Who ? " <p> " Dr. Richard Madera . " <p> Sarah released her temples . A surge of blood slammed her heart to a stop ; her pulse raced when her heart began beating again . She opened her eyes . Jason 's face floated across from her on a tide of actinic flashes . <p> He smiled . " So you see , " he said , " not only would it be an act of loyalty , but one of revenge . " <p> The hermit crab scrabbles across the floor of the tide pool , pausing to shove aside a pebble in its path , then darts over the uneven stone to a pocket of sand just beyond Sarah 's sight . She leans further over the pool . The hermit crab trots into the fissure only to back out quickly , followed by the claw-waving decorator crab . Sarah smiles . <p> Richard liked hermit crabs . He refused to let her keep a tank of nudibranchs at home , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch them change shells . He brought home shells for her hermit crabs the way some spouses brought home flowers for the piano . Perhaps if she could remember when he stopped bringing home cowries and conches , she could figure out when and why the marriage went sour . <p> But maybe not . <p> Sarah reaches for the hermit crab , careful to touch only the shell , not the tender body . The crab tucks itself deeper inside its fortress . Sarah lifts it from the water . Frantic , it shakes a claw at her . <p> SARAH LOOKED up from the microscope and stared at the cupboards and equipment around her , a habit she 'd fallen into since Jason Whitcomb 's visit five days ago . She could call the police , but no one would believe her . And even if they did , MediChem would cover it up , Richard would die in some " accident , " and she would lose the lab . <p> She placed her hand against the cool wall of the tank . The lab was her world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitcomb  --  and Richard 's voice . <p> Whenever she relaxed , her mind replayed the night Richard left . Maybe I just need a fling , maybe I 'll be back , he 'd said . But right now , I need someone with a real life , someone alive . <p> My work is too important right now , she 'd said . I need to develop that skin so my mother and people like her can live . <p> Sarah , you work seven days a week , twelve , fifteen hours a day . You do n't care about people  --  you do n't see your mother anymore , or anyone else . You do n't even see me , and I live with you . <p> I see you when I get home from the lab . <p> For a whole half hour before you drop into bed . You 're hiding in that lab , closing yourself off . <p> I 'm getting results.t What are you getting ? <p> He 'd glared at her through hateful , narrowed eyes . God , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your insulated little cave . <p> But the next morning it was Sarah who did the smashing . Lining up his prized Waterford crystal on the concrete patio , Sarah had taken Richard 's hammer and shattered each tumbler , each wine , sherry , and champagne glass . " Just try to use these with her ! " she 'd shouted . " Just try ! " <p> A giddy elation bubbled through her all day , sustained her whenever a pang of loss clawed at her in the lab . Sustained her  --  until she went home to the wink and sparkle of splintered crystal . <p> By the time Richard returned two days later to collect his things , she had replaced each glass  --  after twenty-seven phone calls and a hundred and thirty-three mile round trip to three specialty stores in San Francisco . <p> Sarah blinked and turned to watch a spotted nudibranch creep along the bottom of the tank that stood beside the microscope . Her temples pounded . God , I 'd love to smash your lab , force you out of your insulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Richard was doing  --  smashing her lab by beating her at her own research ? A cold anger built in her . He had his airhead lab tech , why could n't he just leave her alone ? Why destroy the only thing she had left ? <p> Sarah winced . The only thing ? <p> She remembered the day her father called the lab . No one else had come in that day ; Sarah answered the phone . At the sight of her father 's face , she tensed . Staring at the palm-sized videoscreen , she prayed her mother had n't found another melanoma . " What is it , Dad ? " she said . " Is Mom all right ? " <p> " She 's fine . She 's right here beside me , Pumpkin , " her father said . Her mother leaned into view . " We just wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas . " <p> Her eyes suddenly focused on the lab . Snowflakes cut from old memos flurried across the window while garlands of colored pipette tips hung from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam , the lab techs . " Is it Christmas , Dad ? " she asked . <p> " Ho ho ho ! Sure is , Pumpkin , " her father said . <p> Her mother smiled . " Merry Christmas , darling . " <p> She hung up the phone , walking to the window to peer out at the woodland beyond . Richard had always dragged her from the lab on Christmas Eve , bodily if necessary , and driven her to the snow . Then at midnight they had toasted with the Waterford champagne glasses . But this year Richard and his airhead toasted in some alpine cabin . <p> She 'd turned away from the window and gone back to her work . She had her research ; there was nothing she 'd rather be doing . Nothing else worth doing . <p> Sarah pressed her hand against the side of the aquarium . " Damn you , Richard , " she said . " You could at least leave me this . " <p> One of the lab techs leaned toward her . " Dr. Huron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , forcing a smile . " Just talking to myself . " <p> " I 'll be back next week , " Jason Whitcomb had said that first Sunday . Sarah imagined Richard wielding a sledge hammer , shattering the aquarium and the microscopes . Then she imagined him in a heap , his limbs partially eaten away by acid . A chill satisfaction filled her , followed by an aching loneliness . <p> Sarah sets the hermit crab down carefully . It skitters toward the fissure , scrambling over the top of the decorator crab . The larger crab raises its claws and sidesteps in pursuit of the intruder . <p> " Someday you 'll get out of the tide pool , " Sarah tells the hermit crab . " Just do n't get caught in another one . " <p> The following Sunday Sarah walked into the lab to find Jason Whitcomb perched on the counter by the sink . " Been to Thieves ' Point lately ? " he asked . <p> Sarah looked away . " Yesterday . " <p> " Ah , been thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her temples to keep the headache at bay . " Why this ? Why go to all this trouble ? " <p> Jason shrugged . " Because not only do we want to kill him , we want to discredit his research . If he dies of some weird , mysterious neurotoxin  --  one which , incidentally , we 'll also use to contaminate his cultures  --  the public will never trust his nano-engineered skin . " <p> " If someone finds out about it . " <p> " We 'll make sure someone does . " He smiled at her . " The public loves a mystery and the media loves to give it to them . " <p> The headache blinded Sarah momentarily . She closed her eyes . " Would n't it be enough to destroy his lab ? " <p> " We could leave him a vegetable . " <p> She opened her eyes . " So whatever I decide , Richard is dead . " <p> " Looks that way . " Jason studied her . " You know , Dr. Huron , at your age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new corporation . . . providing anyone hires you . MediChem would never be able to recommend you , of course . " <p> He nodded thoughtfully , almost sadly . " I met a man with a Ph.D . in biochemistry the other day . He was working at a men 's clothing store . Said he could n't get a research position . Tried for years . Dried up , bitter man . " <p> Sarah shuddered . " I would n't have to wear the skin ? " <p> " No . We 've got someone lined up for that . " <p> " And this person is going to shake Ri  --  the victim 's hand repeatedly or something ? " <p> Jason 's smile deepened . " Seduce him . You know , do n't you , that he left the lab tech ? " <p> Sarah straightened , her shoulders rising . <p> " Oh , yes , " Jason said . " She did n't last long , just a couple of months . He 's been , how should I put it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her shoulders collapsed . Maybe I just need a fling . . . . Or maybe a hundred flings . Or maybe he would never come back . " He was working on a cure for lung cancer when he worked for MediChem . " <p> Jason 's eyes narrowed , but not with a smile this time . " That 's what he wanted us to think . " <p> Sarah laughed incredulously . " You ca n't believe he was an industrial spy from the start ! " <p> " He left suddenly , did n't he ? Both you and the company . Maybe he got what he needed from both of us . " His voice dropped to a whisper . " He used you , Sarah . " <p> Her stomach knotted . Used her , then thought so little of her , he 'd set about to destroy the most important part of her life , the only thing left of her life . In her mind she swung the hammer , not at Richard 's Waterford crystal , but at his head . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you going to help , Dr. Huron ? " <p> Sarah flushed . <p> Jason scraped his foot across one of the cabinet doors . " Of course , if you refuse , you may prove too dangerous . . . . " <p> Sarah stared at the floor , imagining it opening up to swallow her . The chasm rumbled wider , one side stretched by Richard , the other by Jason . <p> Sarah looked up at Jason slowly , her gaze taking him in from foot to face . She paused at his crotch , wondering if the man was devoid not only of a heart but of other traces of humanity as well . She looked him in the eye . " All right , " she said . " I 'll develop the skin for you . But I 'll need to run tests on the person I 'll be grafting . " <p> Jason hopped from the counter . His shoes slapped the linoleum . " She 's waiting in the lounge down the hall . " <p> " Wait , how soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him away , startled at the contact . Jason wheeled to look at her , surprised . Sarah curled into herself , lifting her chin . " How soon do you expect me to have this finished ? " <p> " Not till early summer . Say , end of May , early June . " <p> " I do n't know if I can  --  " <p> " I know about your prototype , Sarah . " <p> She shook her head . " But two months  --  " <p> " You can do it , Sarah . You will do it . " He walked briskly to the door . <p> Sarah paced before the aquarium . Her mind sped through every process and experiment that had produced the skin . Yes , she could do it . The prototype needed few improvements and the glands  --  <p> She turned when the lab door clicked open . Jason escorted a young woman in by the elbow . Sarah scored her palms with her nails . A tall woman , the assassin strolled into the room , her thick waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In stature and in build , she was similar to Richard 's lab tech  --  except for her mane of red hair . <p> Sarah glances over her shoulder again . A lone figure appears on the horizon , wavering like a mirage . Sarah turns again to the tide pool . She hugs her knees , resting her chin between them as she stares into the water . A transparent fish no bigger than her little toe darts across the pool , brushing the tentacles of the larger anemone . The anemone closes on the fish , clasping its prize in its fist of stinging fingers . <p> Celeste sat beside the flotation tank , her right arm submerged in the buoyant fluid . Wired dermals dotted her forearm like moles . " So why did he leave you , he ever tell you ? " she asked . <p> " Sort of , " Sarah said . She liked Celeste 's Sunday visits , even though the other woman insisted on bringing up painful topics . Sarah touched Celeste 's arm above the elbow . " Move your arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Celeste twisted her arm , the gel coating her forearm translucent , glistening . " How long before it becomes skin ? " <p> " Another half hour . " Sarah touched the edge of the graft , a bit of the gel sticking to her fingers . " Celeste , are you putting on weight ? " <p> Celeste shrugged her left shoulder . " A little . So , anyway , why did he leave ? " <p> " He said he wanted more out of a life , " Sarah said , checking the monitors . Everything looked good . There was no sign of tissue rejection . " I 've told you this . " <p> " So he went after some blonde twit . He have a thing for blondes ? " <p> " Yeah . I mean , that 's what he always seemed to notice . You know , when we were out to dinner or out to a movie . " Sarah smiled , shaking her head . " I used to tease him that his ideal woman was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips , and a wide bottom . " <p> " A fat ass , huh ? And is that what this lab tech was like ? " <p> Sarah winced . " Yeah . Yeah , she was . " <p> Celeste shifted a little . She glanced over at the aquarium . " Those little nudibranches are kind of ugly . Cute ugly . You ever think about adding sea horses to the tank ? " <p> " Too much trouble . " She avoided Celeste 's gaze . " I need another blood sample . " <p> Celeste offered her left arm . She grunted at the prick of the syringe . " He really hurt you , " she said . <p> Sarah smeared blood across a slide , then set the slide on the counter . She robbed the bridge of her nose with the back of her hand . <p> Celeste touched Sarah 's face . Sarah blinked as the other woman erased a tear from her cheek with the tip of a finger . " You really loved him , " Celeste said gently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of this lab . " <p> " I had no idea he was unhappy . One night he came home and told me he was leaving me . He 'd accepted the job at Hansen without even telling me he 'd applied . " Sarah 's voice quavered . " I had no idea . " <p> Celeste caught the second tear . " What was he like , Sarah ? " <p> " Oh , a kind man . " <p> " Kind , after what he did to you ? " <p> " He  --  he seemed kind . And intelligent . A good sense of humor . " <p> Celeste studied her . " Yeah ? " <p> Sarah shrugged helplessly . " He . . . loved to go for walks in the evening after the UV levels dropped . He was careful about stuff like that , a health nut . And he loved Waterford crystal . " <p> Celeste nodded , resubmerging her right arm which had risen above the surface of the fluid . " He liked Waterford crystal , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he liked reading . . . . " Sarah stared into her hands . But what had Richard read ? Had she ever asked , ever bothered to find out ? Sarah sank to the floor next to Celeste 's chair , her legs tucked under her . What had Richard liked ? Which sports , which foods ? Well , broccoli , but when they went to dinner what sort of dishes did he order ? Sarah began to tremble . She knew about his research , about his experiments in molecular assemblers , but what was his favorite dessert ? His favorite flower ? She buried her face in her hands . What was his favorite color ? <p> Her hands filled with tears . " God , oh God . " <p> Celeste 's left arm wound awkwardly around her , pulled her close . " He really hurt you , the bastard . And now he 's trying to discredit your research by making it obsolete . Fucking bastard . " <p> Sarah tried to protest , but the words dissolved beneath the weight of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , " Celeste crooned . " We 'll fix him , Sarah . We 'll fix him . " <p> Sarah screamed around her fist . <p> And thought about Richard , and who he was . Thought about those two things all week long , wandering through the house late at night , touching the few books Richard left behind , laying out the jewelry he 'd bought her , the delicate wire rings and earrings , the thin gold chain with the three diamonds and the gold star . She played the albums he 'd forgotten . And she waited for Sunday so that she could tell Celeste about Richard . <p> " He likes Chopin and old nineties metal and  --  " The words died on Sarah 's lips as Jason walked through the lab door behind Celeste . Sarah 's hands knotted , then fell open in surprise . Celeste strode into the room , dressed in an old black leotard and pink tights . Her hair , once so red , was a pale , sun-kissed blonde . In the past month and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom ballooned . She was Richard 's dream woman come to life . <p> Sarah 's shoulders folded inward . Her chest felt as though it would crack with the pressure . Jealousy weighted the edge . As soon as Richard met Celeste , as soon as  --  The image of Celeste and Richard entwined , tangled in fresh white sheets burned through her . Sarah 's hands clenched and unclenched . <p> " What do you think ? " Celeste said , spinning . <p> " Perfect , is n't she ? " Jason said . " With bait like this , we should have no trouble landing him . " <p> " Piece of cake , " Celeste said . Her eyes glowed with satisfaction . But not just satisfaction  --  pity stared back at Sarah , and scorn . Sarah searched Celeste 's face for the kind , empathic person who had worked so hard at opening her up . . . worked so hard . . . . <p> Sarah hugged herself to ward off the sudden chill . Of course it was work . Celeste needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill Richard . Kill him . Ice filled the void in Sarah 's heart as the reality of it hit her . Not some fantasy , some childish revenge  --  dead . And there would be no putting Richard back together , no calling around to replace him . <p> Driven by the excitement and the fear , she had lost sight of the goal , had only paid it lip service . As she had with her research . . . . <p> " When will the skin be ready ? " Jason said . <p> Sarah stared at him blankly , then shook herself . " Two weeks . " <p> " Do you have any further need of Celeste ? " <p> " No . I do n't think so . " <p> Celeste smiled at her , a smile tinged with scorn . " Well , Dr. Huron , if that 's the case , " she said , and turned to leave the room . She paused at the door . " Let me know when you need me for the final graft , Jason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . <p> " We managed to get some information from the lab tech , " Jason said . Numb , Sarah nodded . <p> " Oh , and MediChem is delighted with your progress . I understand the company is going to budget more money for your research . That should give you something to think about . Time for another trip to Thieves ' Point , ch , Sarah ? " <p> She stared at him . He crouched before the aquarium , a smirk tainting his lips . Celeste was n't the only one who had worked hard to reach her . <p> The mirage solidifies into a man . Sarah watches him for a while , then removes her shirt and her hat . Her body flushes with the unfiltered heat , her bikini top damp with perspiration . She dips her hand in the tide pool , hoping the cold water bubbling over her wrists will cool her . The sea anemone reopens at the disturbance of the water . <p> Sarah worked on the skin . When it came time for the graft , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensors , then helped Celeste into the flotation tank . After injecting the cultures into the gel , Sarah sat down to watch the monitors . <p> Hours later , Celeste toweled off , the chafe of the terry cloth adding a healthy glow to the new skin . Sarah 's voice broke as she explained how to activate the neurotoxin glands linked to Celeste 's nervous system . She fell silent . <p> Celeste tossed her ice-blonde hair with a laugh of triumph . " Do n't worry , Dr. Huron . I 'm a professional . And I enjoy my work . " <p> " Enjoy it ? " Sarah whispered . <p> " Killing is exciting , " Celeste said . <p> Jason grinned . <p> Sarah took a deep breath and began her explanation again . <p> AS JASON strolls toward her , his unbuttoned shirt flapping in the breeze , Sarah rises . Her right leg tingles awake ; she sinks again into the squatting position . She takes a long draught from her water bottle , the liquid tantalizing her parched throat . She hesitates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops , staring at her , a frustrated , angry cast to his features . " I knew I 'd find you here , " he says . " Something went wrong , Sarah . " <p> The blood drains from Sarah 's face . She swallows . <p> Later , Sarah repeated the explanation . " The glands are activated by a pulse rate of 200 or higher . A strong dose of adrenaline will do it . " <p> " And you 've given her an adrenaline tablet ? " Richard said . <p> " Yes . Watch her . When you get to the hotel room , she 'll probably ask for a glass of water . I made sure the tablet was too big for her to swallow without water . " <p> Richard 's lower lip trembled . " You 're sure , Sarah ? " <p> Sarah turned away , unable to meet his black eyes . " I 'm sure , Richard . I designed the skin . Be very careful . Please . " <p> She expected him to walk away without saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . At the very least . A string of obscenities seemed likely , too , or even a slap or a punch . Any of them seemed likely considering what she had just told him  --  that she had helped plan his assassination . <p> But Richard took her hand under the table , squeezed it , and said , " Thank you . " <p> Sarah looked up . Horror and anger colored his face , but gratitude muted them . " I 'm sorry , " she said . <p> Richard coughed . " You hated me that much ? " <p> " I thought I did . " She turned away . " I thought you were  --  were . . . . " <p> Richard cleared his throat . " You thought I was trying to destroy your research . " <p> She pressed her lips together , nodded . She could only guess at the other lies Jason had told her , keeping her lab was probably one of them . She forced a smile . " I thought you were taking away my reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know that . " <p> " Sarah , " he murmured . <p> Silence stretched between them . Richard sat up suddenly . " Did anyone follow you ? " <p> " No . I made sure . " <p> " You 're positive ? " <p> " I left the lights on in the lab and climbed out the window . And no one 's following you . You have a date with her tonight . That 's all they need to know about your whereabouts . " She flicked her hand free and slid from the booth . " I better go . " <p> " Sarah ? " <p> She looked at him . <p> " Sarah , be careful . " <p> Sarah 's heart pounds . Jason climbs the rock and looms over her . " What ? " Sarah says . " What happened ? " <p> " Something went wrong with the skin , " Jason says . <p> " No , it could n't have , " Sarah says . She stands quickly . Her right leg , still a mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jason catches her . She clings to him , taking the weight off of her throbbing leg . " No , Jason , " she says to his bare chest . " No , nothing went wrong . " <p> He steadies her , his fingers digging into her arms . His voice is low and accusatory . " Bullshit . The whole thing went wrong . " <p> She shakes her head . Her temples hammer as if the veins will burst . " No , " she says . <p> " You lying bitch ! " Jason holds her away from him and shakes her .
