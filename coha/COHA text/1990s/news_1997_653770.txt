<p> Why is Compaq Computer , the world 's No. 1 personal computer maker , acting like a company on the ropes ? <p> Because , as much as Eckhard Pfeiffer , Compaq 's intense , silver-haired chief executive is focused on pushing his company into the future , he is also haunted by its past . Nearly six years ago , he was swept into the corner office at Compaq 's leafy campus here after the board had abruptly dismissed the founder , Rod Canion , who made the mistake of allowing the company 's personal computers to be undercut by cheaper competitors . <p> Within a year , the German-born Mr. Pfeiffer , who had made his name as head of Compaq 's European operations , revived the company 's fortunes by drastically lowering its prices . The ensuing price war drove many smaller rivals out of business , but helped propel Compaq from fifth place in the market with $3 billion in sales in 1991 to pass I.B.M . as the top PC maker in 1994 and end last year with sales of $18.1 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stock recently hit its all-time high and the balance sheet shows nearly $5 billion in cash and no debt . And yet . . . <p> " One thing that stuck in my mind from back in 1991 was people kept asking me : What are you going to do to not be surprised again ? " Mr. Pfeiffer recalled recently . <p> So now , anticipating a fundamental shift in his industry , Mr. Pfeiffer , is once again remaking the company . This time he hopes to fend off a mounting threat from personal computer makers like Dell Computer and Gateway 2000 that are able to undercut Compaq and are growing faster by selling made-to-order PC 's directly to customers . <p> But even as he plans to compete more aggressively with these rivals , Mr. Pfeiffer is also intent on making Compaq more than just a PC supplier by turning it into a full-fledged computer company . He recently ordered his reconstituted management team to double Compaq 's annual sales to $40 billion by the end of the decade , which would allow it to leapfrog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of any sort , behind only I.B.M . and Fujitsu . <p> As the personal computer industry gathers in New York this week for the annual PC Expo trade show , Compaq 's moves appear to be heralding yet another round of price cuts . I.B.M . and Hewlett-Packard have said that they would follow Compaq 's lead in matching or beating the lower prices now offered by Dell and Gateway . That would be good news for businesses and consumers . But it would put new pressure on the direct sellers , while perhaps forcing weaker manufacturers to sell out or fold , as happened in the last price war . <p> " We expect this action will drive another wave of market share consolidation , " wrote Don Young , an analyst at Prudential Securities in a report earlier this month . " The strong historical financial returns produced by the direct players appear at risk . " <p> But that assumes Compaq will be successful . If Mr. Pfeiffer has charted the wrong course , or even if he is right but the company can not move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did under his predecessor . <p> " On paper , their plan makes a lot of sense , " said Richard Schutte , an analyst at Goldman , Sachs &; Company . " But the implementation and execution are really unknown . " <p> The heart of Compaq 's plan requires radically altering the company 's relations with the tens of thousands of large and small dealers who sell its computers . Beginning with its new line of desktop PC 's , which will be introduced later this month , Compaq intends to build machines only as customers order them . The idea is to eliminate the thousands of computers held in inventory by distributors around the world . <p> By tradition , Compaq and other computer makers that use the dealer network are obliged to guarantee those inventories against price changes . When the cost of memory , chips or other components drop , as they often do in the fast-changing PC business , Compaq must reimburse its dealers for the price reductions on the computers they already hold . And if the older machines still do not sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , Compaq will guarantee the prices of a dealer 's inventory for only two weeks . And it will not take back any computers unless they simply do not work . As dealers work down their warehouse stockpiles , Compaq hopes by year-end to have a lean two weeks ' worth of dealer inventory across its entire product line . <p> Earl Mason , Compaq 's chief financial officer , who was recently put in charge of putting the new distribution strategy into effect , believes that it will enable Compaq to save $1 billion or more a year . <p> Dell and Gateway do not have such costs because they deliver directly to the customer without going through third parties . As a result their prices are in many cases 10 percent to 15 percent lower than those of Compaq , I.B.M. , Hewlett-Packard and other companies that rely on dealers . Dell and Gateway are also able to introduce PC 's with the newest components faster than their competitors because they do n't have thousands of finished machines gathering dust in warehouses . <p> No wonder that Dell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to shoot from eighth place in the PC industry to fourth . ( Gateway ranks 11th . ) At current growth rates , Dell 's sales would exceed Compaq 's by 2001 , according to Mr. Young . <p> " Let 's face it , " said Emilio Ghilardi , the marketing manager for Hewlett-Packard 's commercial desktop PC 's , " if someone is able to sell a product that is essentially a commodity for 10 percent cheaper than yours , then you have a problem . " <p> Compaq plans to use the money it saves from its new distribution plan to reduce prices . It also intends to hire thousands of new employees to give customers more direct attention from Compaq personnel  --  something its corporate buyers have long requested  --  rather than depending solely on dealers to maintain the relationship . <p> Compaq 's plans have alarmed some dealers , who fear that the company , which had used its strong relations with resellers to reach its current stature , was now abandoning them . They became particularly concerned when stories began emerging earlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smaller direct seller , Micron Electronics . But so far , at least , no such deal has been announced and Mr. Pfeiffer declined to comment . <p> In recent weeks , Compaq has been host to a series of meetings with its largest dealers to explain its strategy and how they will continue to have a key role , especially in terms of providing after-sales installation , trouble-shooting and other forms of customer support . Many dealers now say they are much more comfortable with the planned changes . <p> " I 'm pretty optimistic about how Compaq is thinking about this thing , " said Bill L. Fairfield , the president and chief executive of Inacom , a large national seller of PC 's and services based in Omaha . <p> Not surprisingly , Mr. Pfeiffer 's primary target , Dell Computer 's chairman , Michael Dell , expresses disdain for Compaq 's battle plan . " The basic problem , " Mr. Dell said , " is that you still have the reseller , which is a level of cost and inefficiency that is built into Compaq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , saying that even direct sellers like Dell still must use third-party service providers  --  in many cases , Compaq dealers  --  to install and maintain their machines . <p> " That is what Michael Dell conveniently does n't tell anybody , " he said . " He is putting up a facade that direct is the only way to go , while in the background a lot of his product is flowing through the same channels that we are dealing with . " <p> Beyond portable and desktop PC 's selling for several thousand dollars each , the company has been placing ever greater emphasis in recent years on sales of powerful server computers , which distribute data across networks of PC 's and can cost tens of thousands of dollars . <p> But such machines require more customer handholding  --  something that Compaq as a PC company has never offered but which I.B.M . and Hewlett-Packard , as high-level systems makers , have long specialized in . As Compaq moves up the technological food chain , its dealers ' handholding capabilities will be crucial . <p> So will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to order , which Compaq has been talking about in one fashion or another since 1994 . <p> Over the last year , Compaq has put more and more of the production onus on its suppliers , requiring them to deliver components directly to the factory floor on an as-needed basis . Now , under the new system , which will be driven by complex software linking the entire chain from dealer to supplier , when factory workers arrive at their assembly stations they will find a supply of the components necessary for all of the custom-ordered computers they will build during their 12-hour shifts . <p> As if introducing a new production system were not risky enough , the company will be doing so under an almost entirely new senior-management team that Mr. Pfeiffer has been assembling from outside Compaq over the last two years . So far , though , the new recruits seem to be working out . <p> The chief financial officer , Mr. Mason , for example , has had a major positive impact since coming from Inland Steel in May 1996 . <p> By getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than looking only at income and profits , Mr. Mason increased Compaq 's cash hoard from $700 million to nearly $5 billion in one year . The company 's return on invested capital  --  which is after-tax operating profit divided by operating assets  --  has doubled to 50 percent from 25 percent in that period , Mr. Mason added , and he predicted that it would soon be at triple digits . <p> " Our stock is tremendously undervalued , " Mr. Mason said . " All this re-engineering is going to do nothing but force our profits up . " <p> Compaq shares closed Friday at $100.25 a share , up $3.375 on the New York Stock Exchange . That was down from an all-time high of $108.125 on May 30 , but considerably above a recent low of $72 in April . <p> But Dell and Gateway are not standing still either . Dell has been developing ever closer relations with its corporate customers by setting up Web sites on internal company networks . The system enables individual employees at customer locations to easily order from a pre-approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to push ahead on Compaq 's chosen path . " We 've recognized a significant change very much in time and taken action , " he said , " and not waited until something went sour and then tried to come out of a hole .
