WHEN MICHAEL IS PUT DOWN FOR A NAP , he needs to have his favourite ( and rather grubby ) teddy bear snuggled next to him . Anna trails a tattered blanket behind her wherever she goes . Jared has a treasured diaper that he strokes as he sucks his thumb and settles down to sleep . Author and paediatrician T. Berry Brazelton calls them " loveys " and considers them almost a necessity . In his book Toddlers and Parents , he writes : " In a society which fosters as much early independence as ours does , it seems obvious that we as parents must also respect the importance of balances to this expensive independence . I feel it is an important kind of learning for a child to be able to comfort herself , to subside with a familiar , beloved crutch . " Child - care expert Penelope Leach agrees . " On the whole , these " cuddlies " are a good thing  --  the babies who adopt them are the lucky ones . They seem to serve a real purpose , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adult control  --  your mother may not always be available to you , but your cuddly is . That control is very important to the child . " Leach explains that the " more technical " name for the lovey or cuddly is a " transitional comfort object . " " That means it 's used for comfort between the time when the parent leaves and they baby falls asleep . If the parent is there during that time , the baby is n't likely to need to become attached to something else . " Some parents feel quite passionately that they do not want their children soothed by blankets or teddy bears . They want to do that comforting themselves . None of my four have ever had " loveys , " and I do n't think they 've ever felt a need for them , " says Lenore Kilmartin . " If they needed cuddling because they were unhappy during the day , I gave them cuddling , and they always slept beside me so they never wanted a blanket or anything at night . " Lenore believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comfort than any teddy bear can . " There 's the skin - to - skin contact , the familiar voice , the loving arms , the chance to talk about how you 're feeling even if you ca n't express it very well . " Lenore 's husband , Brian , adds , " It has been easier for us to parent this way because Lenore is at home full - time , and when I 'm here it seems quite normal to me to hold or rock Claire while she falls asleep . There 's just never been an opportunity for them to get attached to a blanket or something , because they always have a parent around . " Penelope Leach notes that babies are all quite different , and that some will become attached to a pillowcase or mother 's nightgown because they like to stroke it while being nursed to sleep . Then they may want to take that object with them at other times , even though mother is also available . ( She cautions that parents should encourage their babies to choose appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have your toddler lovingly carry around your nursing bra when friends and relatives drop by ! ) While toddlers are often fiercely attached to their chosen object , it is during babyhood that the attachment is first formed . Some babies strongly resist having a lovey , no matter how much parents try to encourage it , while others will become very attached to something and catch parents by surprise . Because Kathy Cunningham 's first daughter had enjoyed sleeping on a sheepskin mat , she bought another one when her second daughter , Shane , was born . Although Shane was quite colicky as a newborn , Kathy found it easy to put her to sleep on the mat . Soon she discovered that Shane was very attached to the sheepskin and wanted to take it everywhere . I gave her the new one to sleep on , and then we cut up the old one that had been Kylie 's , and we called them Shane 's " pieces ' ' , " Kathy recalls . " That way we had some extras , but she really liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel to them . " Leach recommends that as soon as parents notice their child is developing a strong attachment to something , they prepare " to protect against the disaster of the object being lost . " That might mean cutting a blanket into several smaller pieces , buying another identical teddy bear , or stashing away a few more diapers . " It wo n't have that same special texture , but it will be better than nothing if the other one is lost . " Kathy remembers a trip to visit grandparents in another province where Shane 's " pieces " were accidentally left behind . The grandparents tried buying a stuffed lamb , but Shane rejected it ; it just did n't feel right . Finally she ended up sleeping with Grandma 's fur coat because it came the closest to the texture she wanted . As Leach points out , parents of children with loveys have an extra responsibility : making sure the lovey is n't lost and helping them find a substitute in case it is . " Those blankets or bears are very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets left behind , so you ca n't take it lightly . " Although a lovey may help a child get to sleep or deal with other stresses in his life , it 's equally important not to overuse it  --  giving him a blanket and pacifier when time with mom or dad is really what 's needed . Whether your child has a lovey or not should n't be a source of concern for parents , Leach says . " If it happens , it 's a nice thing rather than a bad thing . " But she would n't worry about a child who has no need for one . Perhaps the key point to remember is that toddlers often need extra help in coping with the stresses of growing up , especially if , as Brazelton explains , the child is expected to be independent and frequently separated from parents . Whether toddlers find that soothing in a special teddy bear , or in dad 's arms , parents should respect the importance of being comforted through difficult times . <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
