When the Pentagon announced last December that it was retiring the famed Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird , it explained that satellites can do what the high- flying ( 100,000 ft. ) , 3,000-m.p.h. spy plane did and at less cost . But was the real reason that an even faster snooper is being developed in the Nevada desert ? The 1986 defense budget contained a mysterious reference to the " Aurora " project . Now a prototype of the aircraft is reported to be rocking the desert with shock waves during test flights . Rumors say the Lockheed plane may be unmanned and can fly at speeds greater than Mach 6 ( 4,100 m.p.h. )  --  fast enough to cross the Pacific in less than two hours . Neither the Air Force nor Lockheed will confirm its existence .
