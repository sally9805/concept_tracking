When Pride Still Mattered By David Maraniss Simon &amp; Schuster , $27.50 // This profile of legendary football coach Vince Lombardi , which forges a near-perfect synthesis of fine writing and fascinating material , may be the best sports biography ever published . In Lombardi , author Maraniss has a subject worthy of the considerable research and narrative skills he demonstrated in a controversial 1996 biography of President Clinton . // St. Vincent was surely no Slick Willy . In his private life Lombardi was , in the vernacular of his time , a square : He wore hats and galoshes and rain slickers , the latter made of translucent plastic , and played golf and gin rummy and cried and screamed and smoked and sweated and watched Tom and Jerry cartoons and laughed so hard that tears squirted out of his eyes like windshield-wiper spray . He fell asleep in the recliner in his den and snored away until supper . // This is the same man who was the very symbol of the tyrannical coach obsessed beyond reason with winning . He was the genius who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipped it by the sheer force of his will into the holy terror that won five NFL championships , including the first two Super Bowls , in his nine years at the helm . He was the master of all he surveyed , and in heavily Catholic Green Bay he was called the Pope . // Actually , he was a good deal more complicated than that . And he did n't coin the famous line that is always credited to him : " Winning is n't everything , it 's the only thing . " Maraniss traces that chestnut back to former Vanderbilt and UCLA coach Red Sanders , who first used it , possibly in jest , in the mid-1930s when he was coaching at Columbia ( Tenn . ) Military Academy . Lombardi did , of course , believe that winning was the only thing , but not at the cost of cheating or dirty play , which he forbade . In fact , at the start of his career he was so uncertain of the worthiness of coaching that he sought somehow to elevate his job to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the " philosopher-coach. " // Lombardi was a mass of contradictions . He was an avowed believer in family , but while he busied himself making a family of his team , he sorely neglected his wife , who suffered from depression and alcohol addiction , and their son and daughter . He could be abusive and dictatorial , but he was so painfully shy that , as Maraniss writes , " he had to screw up his courage every day to be a public figure . " He was a tyrant without a trace of bigotry regarding race , religion or sexual preference . He loved his players , but he could motivate them by browbeating them to the point at which they temporarily despised him . Then he 'd win back their love . " The players understood , " said Packers guard Jerry Kramer . " This is one beautiful man . " // Lombardi died of cancer at 57 in 1970 , possibly , Maraniss suggests , at the right time : " He was in danger of being reduced to a convenient symbol by then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debates of that war-torn era . The establishment had turned him into stone even while he was alive , hoisting him up as a monument to righteousness , patriotism and free enterprise . Counterculturists smashed him as a relic of old-line authoritarianism and a dangerous win-at-all-costs philosophy . Both were wrong .

" When you 're a small guy from a small school , " he writes , " you pretty much have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beg no more . // Inside the Meat Grinder By Chad Brown and Alan Eisenstock St. Martin 's Press , $24.95 Chad Brown , an NFL official , rises to the defense of his colleagues in this account that is written , curiously enough , in the third person : " Chad is an indifferent flyer . He 's never afraid , never thrilled , mostly bored . " At least he 's on a first-name basis with himself .
