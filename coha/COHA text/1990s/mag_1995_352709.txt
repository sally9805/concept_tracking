High in the Himalayas lives the Guru of Low Comedy , surrounded by his tapes of Laurel and Hardy , W.C. Fields and the brothers Zucker . " Great Master , what is the secret of a hit ? " ask Hollywood 's best and richest when they are ushered into his presence . " Make ' em laugh , " is the inevitable reply , " any damn way you can . " <P> It is said that fastidious filmmakers retreat in dismay muttering , " Does he mean , like , bathroom jokes ? " Ignoring the advice , they end up dying out there with cute , cautious comedies like Speechless and I.Q. ( not to mention spineless farces like Mixed Nuts ) . Meanwhile , Dumb and Dumber becomes the most popular movie in America . " Gross-out grosses , " its rivals may sniff , and they would not be wrong . But so what ? The fact is that D and D  --  in comparison with which Jim Carrey 's other pictures look as if they were scripted by Oscar Wilde  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <P> Lloyd , the lead moron in Peter Farrelly 's film , is played by Carrey , sublimely confident that he knows what he 's doing as he attempts to return a briefcase full of funny money to a woman ( Lauren Holly ) with whom he is smitten . This involves a cross-country journey with Harry ( Jeff Daniels ) , Lloyd 's equally dense roommate , in a truck that looks like a gigantic sheep dog . In order to enjoy the pair 's company , adult viewers must regress to those thrilling days of yesteryear when bodily dysfunction represented the height of hilarity . But Carrey ( ably abetted here by the woofly Daniels ) is both symbol and satirist of our apparently irresistible dumbing down . Astonished attention must be paid .
