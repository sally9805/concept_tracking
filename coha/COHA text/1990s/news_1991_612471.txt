<p> The U.S. Supreme Court recently heard arguments in Lee v. Weisman , a case that will determine whether spoken prayer during a public high school graduation ceremony is constitutional . <p> This case may have far-reaching implications beyond the immediate issue at hand . Many legal experts believe that the court will reconsider the precedent established in Lemon v. Kurtzman , which set forth a tripartite test for deciding " establishment " cases . <p> A recent editorial in The Atlanta Constitution noted that " Lemon has its defects . " In particular , its prohibition against " excessive entanglement " between government and religion is vague and confusing . <p> Even the Supreme Court has failed to apply the Lemon test uniformly . In Marsh v. Chambers , for example , the court upheld the Nebraska Legislature 's practice of hiring a chaplain to pray before legislative sessions even though this practice violates all three Lemon standards . <p> Public school administrators , judges and other public officials seem equally puzzled about how to interpret the Lemon test . They routinely overstep their authority and infringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It seems to me that certain government efforts to accommodate religion would not violate the rights of religious or irreligious minorities . I also believe that the public schools are the ideal forum for reintroducing religion into public life in an inoffensive way . <p> While I do not support spoken prayer in public schools , I see nothing wrong with a pause for silent prayer , meditation or reflection at the beginning of the school day . I believe that public schools should offer an elective course about the religions of the world . <p> I 'd like to see public school textbooks and courses about American history reflect our nation 's rich religious heritage . Like many other parents of school-age children , I would welcome tuition tax credits , vouchers or financial aid to parochial schools . <p> If the reasoning behind Lemon is faulty , as it appears to be , then it demands reconsideration . Justices Rehnquist , White , Scalia , and Kennedy seem poised to overturn the Lemon precedent . The two most recent court appointments , Justices Souter and Thomas , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Let 's hope that they set forth reasonable standards for deciding future establishment cases in our pluralistic society . <p> In response to Susan Stewart 's Nov. 12 column , women who stay at home are holier than thou ? Of course we are . <p> Let me fill in the readers on what we " at-home " ( I prefer full-time ) moms are doing with our two free hours three times a week . <p> We are sitting in the school clinic so that someone is available with tender loving care should a child become sick or injured . We are chaperoning children on field trips and class outings . <p> We are organizing fund raisers so that schools can afford software to go with the computers . We are coaching , leading and assisting a variety of activities including Scouts , library moms , school tutors and band boosters . <p> Yes , us full-time moms have made sacrifices : some self-esteem , a singular identity , a degree of worldliness and financial independence . But we 've done it for all our children . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pennsylvania vote for Harris Wofford . Sure , the economy is a big factor , and a reasonable health care program is important . <p> But the overlooked factor is that in Pennsylvania , people finally had a chance to vote directly on a Bush nominee . Our northern friends have told the president what they think of a lot of things , including the qualifications of the people that he has put , or tried to put , in key positions . <p> Think about it : Dan Quayle , John Sununu , John Tower , Clarence Thomas , Robert Gates and Dick Thornburgh , who Mr. Wofford defeated . Jack Kemp , Nicholas Brady , Louis Sullivan , Manuel Lujan . He even renominated Alan Greenspan . <p> Why has he inflicted such elitist mediocrity on us ? So that he can be sure of not being outthought ? <p> If a registered Republican like me is so disillusioned by the party led by this team and featuring such luminaries as Sens . Thurmond , Hatch , Simpson and Specter , how strong can the feelings be among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , does anyone out there have balanced economic , defense and social positions , and a moderate women 's and civil rights agenda ? <p> Does anyone out there believe in attracting the best and the brightest people to help run our country , or is the executive branch and the federal judiciary condemned to the wealthy Old Boy Network , Yale graduates and election losers ? <p> I am writing in response to the Nov. 6 editorial about the Clayton County school system that said , " a school board member is an elected official for whom the superintendent and financial director work . " <p> I would like to differ on this point . The superintendent of schools works for the board of education and citizens of the county , and not for an individual board member . <p> I made an open records request as a citizen , and I have no more or less rights to the information requested than any other citizen . If the board of education had made the request it would have been different . But the board of education has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I agree with the open meetings and open records act and believe that the public has the right to know the answers to its questions . My point is that I , as a school board member , have no authority outside the board room . <p> Thanks for the support of open government . <p> Regarding Sandra McIntosh 's Nov. 11 article , " Flap over judgeship jars court in Fulton , " I would like to state that Sanford J. " Sammy " Jones , Superior Court administrator for Fulton County , should be a shoo- in for the appointment to the vacant judgeship on the Fulton juvenile bench . <p> As a child advocate who has observed the Georgia judicial system in action for four years , I am of the opinion that our court system is one of the worst in the country . Yet Fulton 's Superior Court system is an exception to that condemnation , and it is due in part to the leadership and vision provided by Sammy Jones . <p> He has developed numerous programs and initiated court reform to benefit families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patience to listen and the heart to care . He also has a 16-year track record of experience and success . <p> Poor timing is the most I can say about John Head 's Nov. 11 column depicting Jane Fonda as the most vilified person ( MVP ) of the World Series . <p> Veterans Day , when the country expresses thanks to millions of servicemen and women , was used by The Constitution to defend Hanoi Jane . <p> As a Vietnam veteran , I hope " Jane bashing " is always in . She stood up for what she believed in during the Vietnam War - but on the wrong side . <p> Many of us will never forget her smiling as she sat on an anti- aircraft gun in North Vietnam . <p> Her liberalism and the attitude that followed during the ' 60s and ' 70s devasted the strength and inner fiber of this country . A lack of respect for authority - police , military and establishment - evolved from that era and has yet to be cured . <p> She says she 's changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . I think she owes us more of an explanation . <p> David Duke says he 's changed too . Would Mr. Head ask us to stop bashing him too ? I sure hope not .
