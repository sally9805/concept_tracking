The collapse of Denver 's Silverado Banking has exposed much more than just the questionable business relationships of President Bush 's son Neil . The fall of Colorado 's No. 3 savings and loan has put the spotlight on a group of go-go bankers and developers who , with access to Silverado 's money , built political influence in Colorado and even Washington . <P> Congressional investigators are just beginning to probe the way in which Silverado was entwined in dubious deals with M.D.C. Holdings , the state 's largest home builder . Former employees of Silverado and M.D.C. have told TIME that the home builder made improper campaign contributions to local and national politicians . Among those donations were payments made to the 1987 re- election campaign of Denver Mayor Federico Pena in the hope of ensuring that key portions of a huge new $2.9 billion airport , then still on the drawing board , would be located on land owned by Silverado and M.D.C. <P> Most Denver residents welcome the 52-sq. - mi. project , not only to ease air- traffic congestion but also to provide an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the oil bust of the mid- 1980s . When Pena first ran for office in 1983 , he opposed the new airport , advocating instead an expansion of Denver 's Stapleton International Airport . But after he was elected , Pena became a supporter of the popular project . Throughout 1984 , as Denver secretly negotiated with neighboring Adams County for a new site , M.D.C. and Silverado quietly began buying up farmland that would eventually be selected as part of the development corridor leading to the airport . " Despite all the millions of profits they were showing on paper , M.D.C. and Silverado had been running on empty for a long time , and they looked at potential profits from the new airport as a savior , " says a former key employee of M.D.C. 's housing arm . <P> The new owners of the potentially valuable land were members of an emerging power elite in Denver , who proceeded to orchestrate formidable civic support for the airport project . The main boosters : developer Bill Walters , a colleague of Neil Bush 's and then president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of Silverado ; and Larry Mizel , chairman of M.D.C. <P> Mizel met with Pena in 1986 to urge an accelerated time-table for the airport construction . Pena , citing a study forecasting the creation of 20,000 new jobs , announced a plan to move up the airport 's opening date more than a year , to 1992 . When Pena entered a tight race for re-election in 1987 , M.D.C. was a principal backer . <P> Public records show that M.D.C. and its executives contributed $34,000 to his campaign . In fact , the company funneled additional thousands to Pena through back channels . To disguise the extent of its political influence , former employees say , M.D.C. coerced many of its building subcontractors into making contributions to Pena and then allowed them to recoup the money by submitting phony bills for construction work . Asked about these contributions , a Pena spokesman said , " We have absolutely no knowledge of this . "
