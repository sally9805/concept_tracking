AS COPS GO , LOS ANGELES POLICE CHIEF DARYL Gates was rough . But he apparently was n't ready  --  at least not last spring , when the city exploded just hours after a jury found four police officers not guilty in the beating of motorist Rodney King . In a report titled " The City in Crisis , " an investigative team led by former fbi and cia Director William Webster found there was an absence of any real and workable plan to respond aggressively to the crisis . While the report assigned blame to various members of city government , the lion 's share of criticism was leveled against Gates for misleading other city officials into believing an adequate response plan was in place and ready to go . Initial response of the L.A.P.D. was marked by " uncertainty , some confusion and almost a total lack of coordination , " the report found . Gates , even before reading the report , called Webster and Hubert Williams , president of the Washington-based Police Foundation and an adviser to the study team , " liars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report prescribes a step-by- step plan of action . Not only does it recommend redeploying police officers onto patrols , but it also calls for a community-based approach to crime fighting , a style favored by new police chief Willie Williams . Unless city officials act quickly to correct major problems identified in the report , warned Webster , " it could happen again . " The bottom line : the Gates era is over at the Los Angeles Police Department .
