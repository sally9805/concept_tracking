<p> For decades Marine boot camp has been the ultimate individualistic macho ritual , testing a recruit 's ability to withstand taxing physical punishment and humiliating verbal assault . <p> Now the Marines have given the experience a less traditional dimension , introducing exercises designed to promote group bonding , personal values and self-awareness . In one such test aimed at encouraging joint effort , individuals fall backward from a raised platform into the arms of other recruits . <p> " I had to believe they would catch me , " said James Neumeister , visibly relieved that they did during a recent drill . " It was a matter of trust . " <p> The Corps also has extended boot camp by a week and made it even more physically demanding by adding a 54-hour endurance course called " the Crucible . " But other changes , part of a series of revisions in Marine recruitment and training , are aimed at making entry in the Corps not just a physical initiation but also an exercise in personal examination . <p> Even the role of the Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Smokey Bear hat has epitomized the military disciplinarian , is evolving . While there 's still no shortage of loud tongue lashings and other whip-them-into-shape tactics  --  particularly in the early weeks of boot camp  --  the sergeants now lead recruits in frequent discussions of personal values , exploring attitudes toward alcohol , drugs , sex and other issues . In the final Crucible phase of training , the instructors purposefully switch from brow-beating to mentoring their units . <p> " At first I was skeptical of the new approach , " said Staff Sgt. Garritt Duncan , in his third year as an instructor . " I believed the drill instructor was hard core , nose to the grindstone , always screaming and shouting . But now I like having more time in the schedule to talk with Marines . " <p> " The best instructor used to be the one who could yell loudest , " said Sgt. Eborah Lawson , another trainer . " Now it 's who can teach the best . " <p> Marine Corps officials cite several reasons for the changes . By urging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service leaders hope to better prepare them to respond to the increasingly chaotic , complex nature of military operations . The new focus on teamwork and values also comes in response to what Corps officials see as a growing gap between Marine standards and societal behavior . <p> Nowadays , recruits often enter the military from communities where rates of violence , drug use , sexual promiscuity and single parenting are higher than a generation ago . Institutions traditionally central to responsibility and civility  --  church , school , nuclear family  --  are in decline . <p> " Marines today come from a different generation of young people , " said Brig . Gen. Jerry Humble , commander of the Parris Island training facility . " Many have selfish attitudes when they enter . We decided we needed to do something to bond them . <p> " You used to get through boot camp on an individual basis , " the general added . " We felt the teamwork notion needed to be reinforced . " <p> Since last month , training at camps here in the swampy lowlands of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended from 11 to 12 weeks to provide for the rigorous Crucible course , which can not be completed unless recruits help each other through it . <p> Corps officials envision the Crucible as the " defining moment " in a young Marine 's life . It is a slog of more than two full days of forced night marches , mock infiltration events , casualty evacuation drills and assorted maneuvers , all done on little sleep and 2 1/2 cold meals . <p> " This recruit will be glad when it 's over , " said James Sturtevant , 19 , taking a rare break at the 42-hour mark the other day , shivering in the zero-degree cold . " It 's the hardest thing I 've done in my life . " <p> At one point , squads of 14 recruits confronted a 10-foot-high wall , pondering how to lift each other over it , including the last recruit . At another station , they struggled to swing across a series of tires suspended on ropes placed frustrating distances apart . <p> At still other events , they clamored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on rope bridges , lending hands and shouting encouragement to teammates all the way . <p> " When I first came out , I thought personally I could do a lot on my own , " said David Clay after finishing the tire swing . " I quickly learned that without help from others , I could n't do it . " <p> Cohesion here is supposed to be fostered not just by facing physical challenges together but also by talking about common values . In weeks preceding the Crucible , recruits attend classes on " core values , " discussing dozens of behavioral scenarios and sharing attitudes on such topics as alcohol abuse , illegal drug consumption , adultery , fraternization and professional conduct . <p> During one such recent " locker box talk "  --  so nicknamed because recruits sit on or near foot lockers in their barracks  --  Sgt. Molly Ricks led a platoon of women in a discussion of what to do when a fellow Marine appears to have a drinking problem . <p> One recruit told of being treated belligerently by a friend after suggesting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binges . Another related a story about a friend who got pregnant unintentionally while drunk , and only then was compelled to stop drinking . A third recruit spoke movingly about her brother , who consumed a case of beer every night and frequently got into trouble with neighbors . <p> Additional group talks under the stress of the Crucible can provide even greater personal insights , according to recruits and instructors . <p> " I 've found things out about my platoon that I did n't know , " said Sgt. Shawn Kopaczewski , a senior instructor . " They 'll talk about experiences in childhood , for instance , in ways they might never have expressed before . Because of the group bond that 's formed , they speak more freely . " <p> As much as boot camp may be adjusting to the ' 90s , Marines have drawn a line against one change well underway in the basic training programs of other military services : sex-integrated instruction . Corps officials say initiation into their ranks is difficult enough without mixing men and women in boot camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drill instructors as role models . <p> " We believe the first step should be socialization into our ethos , " said Gen. Charles Krulak , the Marine Corps commandant , who surveyed the Crucible here earlier this month . " That 's tough enough without throwing all the rest on top . " <p> For Krulak , the notion that boot camp was lacking something took hold soon after he assumed command of the Corps in mid-1995 , when he absorbed the shocking news that two young Marines in Okinawa had participated with a Navy sailor in the rape of a Japanese teenager . <p> " That incident was a defining moment for me , it was a red alert , " Krulak said in an interview . He rejected initial plans from subordinates for what he called " changes on the margin " of boot camp , pushing instead for a longer , more challenging new program . <p> In designing the Crucible , Marine planners drew ideas from the Army 's Ranger school and the Navy 's Seals training and also looked at endurance courses run by Outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grueling course has not resulted in a higher attrition rate among recruits , as some senior officials had expected . <p> To sustain the group spirit of Crucible graduates , Corps officials plan to start forming new Marines into small teams at skill training schools following boot camp . The teams would deploy to larger units and remain together during the members ' initial four-year enlistments . <p> " We realize you 're not going to change anyone 's value system in a week , " Krulak said . " No one is that naive . Do we think this 'll be 100 percent effective ? Of course not . But suppose we can get this 50 percent right . My God , it 's going to change the Corps ! "
