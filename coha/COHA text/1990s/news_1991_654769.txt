<p> But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat . <p> - Traditional folk song AS Grady Woolsey steers his small truck up a hillside dirt road , soldier-straight rows of plump , squat lemon trees flutter by like the spokes of a wheel . The chapparal-dry air is heavy with the vinegary stench of rotting citrus . <p> " This is from the freeze , " he says , cracking one of the brittle brown leaves that enshroud each of about 4,000 trees . Littering the branches and ground are hollow , yellow-brown balls , shriveled and juiceless . <p> " This is from the drought , " he says , pulling branches away from one trunk . Just above the soil , a foot-wide swath of bubbling , amber sap girdles the tree . Bark has pulled back from the inner white flesh . <p> With a one-two punch unrivaled in memory or record books , frost and drought have dealt the nation 's most-productive agricultural state a devastating blow , threatening its future as the promised land of farming . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December , virtually wiping out California 's citrus crop and wreaking unknown damage on dozens of row crops . <p> The drought , now in its fifth year , has county , state , and federal water officials sweating over the most serious realignment of water distribution in decades . Rainfall forecasts for 1991 stand at less than half of normal . The Sierra Nevada snowcap is only 13 percent of normal . <p> Last week , President Bush declared a natural disaster in 31 counties . The federal government announced a 75 percent cutback in water delivery . And Gov . Pete Wilson outlined a drought plan Friday that urged local communities to cut water use by half , proposed a $100 million drought fund , and called for a state water bank . <p> " For each of the past four years I never believed this drought would go on for another year , " says John Corkins , a local farmer and chairman of the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board . " The storms continually go north or south of us and we 're starting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Eighty percent of California farms are still family-owned with legacies of hardship dating back to dust bowl days . Statewide loses to farmers , not including related industries , amount to $2 billion this season . " If this goes on five more years , we will be back to the desert from whence we came , " says Mr. Corkins . <p> " California invented itself through water , " says historian Kevin Starr , who has chronicled the century-long building of dams , reservoirs , and aqueducts that turned arid valleys of sage into agriculture- and people-rich oases . <p> " Now the re-invention of the new , limited California is coming through water , " he says . <p> HERE in the second-most agriculturally productive US county - Fresno to the north is first , Kerns to the west is third - farmers , biologists , and agricultural specialists such as Mr. Woolsey are still assessing the damage caused by the cold snap . And they are girding for more drought . <p> Tulare County gets all of its surface water from the Friant-Kern Canal , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , the Bureau cut back water delivery from the Friant to 5 percent of normal . Although Tulare County has one of the healthiest underground aquifers in the state , farmers must pay to pump their own wells . And the further the water table drops , the more it costs to pump . <p> " Since 1960 , the cost of pumping water here has gone from $12.50 per acre-foot to $67.50 , " says Corkins . ( An acre-foot , roughly 325,000 gallons , is enough to submerge one acre of land under one foot of water - about as much as one urban family of four uses in a year . ) <p> In neighboring Kern County , which has little usable groundwater , farmers have had their surface water turned off completely . The state water project that supplies the area also supplies Los Angeles . When there is a drought , state law says people come before farmers . <p> Pulling together to conserve and share water and other resources , many farmers will let many acres lie fallow or switch away from water-guzzling crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county farmers have switched from wasteful ditch irrigation to a new form water emitters that conserve water , cash , and fertilizer ( See related story ) . <p> " If something 's got to go , many will use what little water they have to salvage permanent plantings such as trees and kiss off their row crops for a year , " says Mario Santoyo , operations manager for the Friant Water Users Authority . <p> ' THIS is the biggest blow to California agriculture in history , and it wo n't bounce back that easily , " says Curtis D. Lynn , Tulare County director for the University of California Cooperative Extension . Tulare sustained $500 million of the state 's $800 million in frost damage to crops . The county 's packing industry lost $150 million and laid off 8,000 workers ; processing lost $100 million . <p> Mr. Lynn points out that some 5,000 acres of trees were wiped out by the freeze ; the trees that survived the freeze will produce lower yields for about three years . And factoring in the drought , those estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every other , " he says . <p> This damage may be offset by past harvests , however . Despite the drought , Tulare County has reached record levels of agricultural output each of the past four years . <p> " The citrus industry expects a freeze every 10 years , " says Fred Foster , executive director of Farm Credit Services , which provides loans to local farmers . " For them , this is like turning the lights off in a high-rise office building - they can find their way around it . " <p> Mr. Foster says there have been no serious instances of insolvency or nonpayment with his company 's loans to citrus growers . " Most are very well collateralized with lots of equity to allow us to stand still for a missed payment or two , or reamortize , " he says . <p> But Corkins says lenders are demanding proof of water allotments or well levels on loan applications . " There are those who have no water who will be bankrupt or insolvent next season . And others who ca n't show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting loans to carry them through , " he says .
