<p> " Television is the mirror of the times , " Angela Lansbury told last night 's global Emmy audience . Never mind the polka dots , maybe she 'll get better wardrobe advice next year . Her observation was valid : TV is the mirror of the times , and the Emmy telecast is the mirror of television . <p> Some years , the mirror reflects dumb shows and lame stars ; some years , fresh faces and thoughtful writing . This year , at a time when dumping on the medium is fashionable , the spectacle reflected both high-minded and hilarious entertainment . <p> " Frasier " and " NYPD Blue " ? You ca n't argue with discerning , consistently superior pursuits that respect the intelligence of the viewer . <p> " The Margarethe Cammemeyer Story " ? A vote of confidence in Hollywood 's ability to tackle tough issues and come down on the side of human rights . <p> Dennis Miller and Jay Leno both beating David Letterman in different categories ? A sign of the times and proof that good writing does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic display of cleavage and ego , a festival of fashion statements and self-congratulation . It 's the night Hollywood dresses up , drives to Pasadena , and makes a case for why TV deserves to be treated as an art form . Here and there , they succeeded . <p> The loser last night was Jason Alexander , while Cybill Shepherd was passable . But , sadly , the Broadway veteran and sitcom actor let us down as co-host . We had expected so much , musically and otherwise . Why was n't Ellen DeGeneres invited back ? She was terrific last year , often improvising gags . We may never know whether Alexander was ad libbing his chats with audience members as he claimed . If he was , he must be mortified . <p> There were few surprises : Barbra Streisand got a standing O. ( " Would it have killed her to do a number ? " co-host Alexander joked . ) When the hectic and much talked-about " ER " was eclipsed by " NYPD Blue , " a more deliberate drama , it seemed there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " this season . <p> Now that the envelopes have been distributed , consider a few categories overlooked by the Academy . <p> Best Inside Joke : " See you Sunday night at 8 , " Paul Reiser said to the pretend-corpse of his network boss , Warren Littlefield . Reiser has been very vocal about his disappointment with the new Sunday time slot for " Mad About You . " ( Locally it 's even worse , at 7 p.m . ) Take that , NBC . <p> Second-Best Inside Joke : Jay Leno , accepting his statuette , said , " I guess this means HBO 's got to shoot a new ending to that movie . " He was referring to the upcoming HBO film , " The Late Shift , " based on the book by New York Times writer Bill Carter , about the Leno-Letterman wars . The book ends with Letterman ascendant . <p> Best Setup Without A Punchline : Cybill Shepherd milked her Emmy-less history for all it was worth , but did n't take home the prize . <p> Best Impersonation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual Emmy Awards on Fox . <p> Best Impersonation of an Overstuffed Pita With Sprouts : the " dress " struggling to contain Julia Louis Dreyffus . <p> Best Impersonation of a Pink Hostess Cupcake : Heather Locklear , in a rosy puffball getup . And Best Supporting Halter : the gladiator leather top worn by Christine Beranski , in a competitive night of Viking dresses . <p> Odd Couple of Presenters : Carl Reiner and Cyndi Lauper . <p> Lead Actor with the Worst Barber : a tie between Ben Kingsley and Anthony Edwards , both just a hair beyond fashionable stubble . <p> Least Likely Substitute for The Rembrandts : The Bobs , the acapella singing group doing the theme from " Friends . " <p> Best Musical Moment : the scene from " The Piano Lesson . " <p> Least Funny Attempt at Humor in the Midst of Heated Rivalry : George Clooney and Anthony Edwards , both of " ER , " hamming it up before Mandy Patinkin walked off with the Emmy . <p> Most Deserving Young Actress , Cheated Again : Claire Danes of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a break . She should have a future full of nominations . <p> Most Mystifying Winner : Candice Bergen . She 's wooden , she lacks the range of most of her fellow nominees , and yet she keeps on winning . <p> Maybe next year it will be Helen Hunt 's turn . <p> TOP AWARDS AT LAST NIGHT 'S EMMYS <p> DRAMA SERIES : " NYPD Blue , " ABC . <p> COMEDY SERIES : " Frasier , " NBC . <p> MINISERIES : " Joseph , " TNT . <p> TELEVISION MOVIE : " Indictment : The McMartin Trial , " HBO . <p> VARIETY , MUSIC OR COMEDY SPECIAL : " Barbra Streisand : The Concert , " HBO . <p> VARIETY , MUSIC OR COMEDY SERIES : " The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , " NBC . <p> LEAD ACTOR , DRAMA SERIES : Mandy Patinkin , " Chicago Hope , " CBS . <p> LEAD ACTOR , COMEDY SERIES : Kelsey Grammer , " Frasier , " NBC . <p> LEAD ACTRESS , DRAMA SERIES : Kathy Baker , " Picket Fences , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bergen , " Murphy Brown , " CBS . <p> LEAD ACTOR , MINISERIES OR SPECIAL : Raul Julia , " The Burning Season , " HBO . <p> LEAD ACTRESS , MINISERIES OR A SPECIAL : Glenn Close , " Serving in Silence : The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story , " NBC . <p> SUPPORTING ACTOR , DRAMA SERIES : Ray Walston , " Picket Fences , " CBS . <p> SUPPORTING ACTRESS , DRAMA SERIES : Julianna Margulies , " ER , " NBC . <p> SUPPORTING ACTOR , COMEDY SERIES : David Hyde Pierce , " Frasier , " NBC . <p> SUPPORTING ACTRESS , COMEDY SERIES : Christine Baranski , " Cybill , " CBS . <p> SUPPORTING ACTOR , MINISERIES OR A SPECIAL : Donald Sutherland , " Citizen X , " HBO . <p> SUPPORTING ACTRESS , MINISERIES OR SPECIAL : ( TIE ) Judy Davis , " Serving in Silence : The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story , " NBC ; Shirley Knight , " Indictment : The McMartin Trial , " HBO . <p> INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE , VARIETY OR MUSIC PROGRAM : " Barbra Streisand : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIRECTING IN A DRAMA SERIES : " ER , " NBC . <p> INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT , DIRECTING IN A COMEDY SERIES : " Frasier : The Matchmaker , " NBC . <p> INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT , DIRECTING FOR A MINISERIES OR A SPECIAL : " The Burning Season , " HBO . <p> INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT , DIRECTING IN A VARIETY OR MUSIC PROGRAM : " The 67th Annual Academy Awards , " ABC . <p> INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT , WRITING , DRAMA SERIES : " ER : Pilot , " NBC . <p> INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT , WRITING , COMEDY SERIES : " Frasier , " NBC . <p> INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT , WRITING , MINISERIES OR SPECIAL : " Serving in Silence : The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story , " NBC . <p> INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT , WRITING , VARIETY OR MUSIC PROGRAM : " Dennis Miller Live , " HBO . <p> CULTURAL PROGRAM : " Verdi 's ' La Traviata ' with the New York City Opera ( Live from Lincoln Center ) , " PBS . <p> INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT , CULTURAL PROGRAM ( Area award : possibility of one , more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Great Performances - Dance In America ) , " PBS . <p> CHILDREN 'S PROGRAM : " The World Wildlife Fund Presents ' Going , Going , Almost Gone !
