One of the shadows dimming the exuberant mood of the victory parades is the thought of the masses of Iraqi soldiers killed . In one of the most lopsided battles in history , 389 Americans were killed and 357 were wounded ; other allied forces suffered 77 dead and 830 wounded . But how many Iraqis died ? No one really knows or probably ever will . <P> In response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council , an environmental group , the Defense Intelligence Agency last week released an internal estimate of 100,000 Iraqi soldiers killed , 300,000 wounded . But DIA said those figures had an " error factor of 50% or higher "  --  to a statistician , a grotesque number . The Pentagon has little wish to refine its figures either . It has strained to avoid both the derision aroused by the body counts announced during the Vietnam War and anything that might sound like a callous boast . Some other assessments indicate the U.S. figures may be too high . Postwar visitors to Iraq have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere near 300,000 . British officials estimate Iraqi losses of 30,000 dead , 100,000 wounded  --  a bare third of the Pentagon 's count . <P> All these numbers are based on a series of extrapolations . First , calculate the approximate number of enemy troops on hand at the beginning of the war . Then , subtract the number of prisoners and the estimated total of deserters . Finally , apply to the remaining force standard ratios : of each 10 soldiers engaged , say , so-and-so many can be counted as killed , so-and-so many wounded . <P> The starting figures are derived from several sources : satellite and aerial- reconnaissance photos , interrogation of prisoners of war , reports from spies and special forces operating behind enemy lines , historical ratios of what percentages of forces engaged have been killed or wounded in past battles . Actual counts of corpses in the gulf war were uncommon . Most dead Iraqis were buried hastily by their comrades before the ground war or by Saudi soldiers after it , with little or no tally . <P> The gulf war was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers have tried to calculate the casualties from the numbers of tanks , other vehicles and artillery pieces destroyed . But aerial photography can not disclose , for example , how many men a wrecked armored personnel carrier might have carried , let alone how many were killed or wounded or escaped unharmed . <P> Also , the U.S. figure of 540,000 enemy soldiers in Kuwait and southern Iraq when the war began seems much too high . It was based on satellite photos from which allied commanders counted the number of divisions deployed . But later interviews with prisoners indicated that many of the units were well below their official strength . Prisoner interrogations also hinted that desertions were even higher than the 150,000 the Pentagon estimated . Allied troops at the start of the ground war found the Iraqi defenses surprisingly thinly manned . So there may not have been enough Iraqis on hand to suffer 400,000 casualties , even if every last one was killed or wounded .
