Section : PREVENTION CLINICS A Prevention writer looks beneath the surface to find the cause of a mysterious rash <p> It started with aching arms . I woke up one Tuesday morning to find that my upper arms were quite sore . I attributed it to a relapse of a joint problem that I 'd had a few months before , and forgot about it . <p> The next day , though , the soreness had become worse . I tried to ignore it , but moving my arms was becoming painful , especially when I tried lifting them over my head . <p> By Thursday , the pain was intense and really did n't seem to be coming from my joints . I began feeling around the sore area . To my amazement , I felt about three or four deep , swollen lumps in each underarm . And they were agony to touch . <p> All kinds of questions came into my mind . And I did n't have a doctor to turn to . My husband , Alan , and I had only recently moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have a doctor yet . I was working at home , so I had no one to ask fora referral . <p> When my husband came home from his office later that evening , I decided to see if he could ask a colleague to recommend a doctor . I said to him , " Alan , this is probably going to sound a little weird to you , but my underarms are killing me ! " <p> He barely let me finish the sentence . He told me his underarms hurt , too ! He also had hidden lumps there , as well as a few visible and particularly painful red bumps around his nipple . Not only that , but there were nasty red streaks stretching from his right nipple toward his underarm . And he , too , grimaced in pain when the lumps were touched . <p> What could these lumps be , and why had we both developed them at virtually the same moment ? UNCOVERING CLUES <p> I fetched my college anatomy textbook . I thought this might have something to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located under the arms . So I looked up the lymphatic system . <p> The lymphatic system , we read , helps clear away infections . And the textbook said that the lymphatic vessels can become inflamed due to a bacterial infection . And the inflammation can cause painful reddish streaks to appear under the skin . It certainly described Alan 's symptoms . Could both of us really be harboring some type of an infection ? <p> I was scheduled to return to the East Coast , and I happened to have an appointment with my doctor there for an unrelated problem . I called her , and she thought it safe to wait until the scheduled appointment to check it out , as long as it did n't get worse . <p> And it did n't . Indeed , the pain and swelling began to diminish . Alan did suffer a little more than me , though . He had to come home from work early for a couple of days . And he always felt terribly tired . RASH DETECTIVES <p> In the meantime , we tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at exactly the same time , if an infection is what we had . We did have one idea . <p> The weekend before , we 'd been presented with a wonderful California-type opportunity : to visit with some good friends in a mountain cabin for a day . We were both excited about the trip . Fresh air , beautiful mountains , old friends ! <p> Our friend 's brother owned the cabin . And a large group had gathered there for his wedding the day before.We arrived on Sunday morning to find happy but tired wedding guests in a lovely bungalow . <p> Best of all , we were delighted to find that the cottage had an outdoor hot tub . In fact , the family and guests had been climbing in and out all morning , relaxing in their postwedding euphoria . <p> I was eager to try it , too . So we hopped in and soaked for about half an hour , the whirlpool jets massaging our muscles . It felt wonderful . <p> Two days later , we began experiencing the mysterious soreness in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CASE CONFIRMED <p> Back East , in my own doctor 's office , I I asked that very question . My doctor confirmed that I did have a bacterial infection . ( Her confirmation was key because symptoms like the kind I had can be caused by other factors , too ) . And she believed that I 'd correctly identified the source of the problem . <p> She herself was from California , and she told me how important it is to be very careful about keeping hot tubs clean . If hot tubs are n't kept clean , you can develop a bacterial infection that leads to the symptoms Alan and I had experienced  --  sometimes called " splash rash . " <p> The bacteria that she mentioned as the likely cause of the infection is called Pseudomonas aeruginosa . <p> I told her I was feeling much better , but my husband was still sore . She said he might need antibiotics if the symptoms persisted . I telephoned Alan that night . It turned out his pain was just about gone , too , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days he was symptom-free as well . <p> Out of curiosity , Alan called the friend who had invited us to the cabin . She had also used the hot tub that weekend . <p> She told us that she had also developed a rash but that it gradually disappeared , though her husband and young daughter , who had not bathed in the hot tub , had not developed any symptoms at all . <p> Now I was sure the hot tub was to blame . This whole experience piqued my curiosity , and I decided to look more deeply into the hot-tub-infection connection . IMMERSED IN THE SUBJECT <p> I found several well-documented articles in the medical literature describing a syndrome called hot-tub folliculitis , also known as pseudomonas folliculitis . There were reports of single cases , and even small epidemics , like one outbreak among dozens of guests at a motel that had a whirlpool . <p> To get more information , I decided to talk to some experts . Pseudomonas is a type of bacteria that normally lives peacefully in the gastrointestinal tract , I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when it 's shed from the skin around the rectal area and gets into the water , that 's when trouble can start for bathers who follow , says Michael L. Ramsey , M.D. , a Wharton , Texas , dermatologist and clinical instructor in dermatology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston . " It can enter any breaks in the skin , or get into the hair follicles ( hence the term folliculitis ) or into the openings of the apocrine sweat glands , " he says . These sweat glands are small bumps normally found around the nipples , the underarms and the pubic area . <p> The resulting rash can look like hives or insect bites . It can be itchy . The spots can develop into blisters . Or they can be very deep , causing the lumps like Alan and I experienced . <p> When I told Dr. Ramsey our story , he said it 's likely that the lymph system became infected with the bacteria . Alan 's red streaks might indeed have been an inflammation of the lymph vessels , draining off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Alan , become tired and even feverish for a few days . TOUGH BUGS <p> There are many bacteria that thrive in hot water , but most of them do n't make people sick . Pseudomonas is an exception . It becomes a problem when the chlorine that 's added to water to kill the bacteria does n't work . " Hot temperatures actually make it harder for chlorine to kill bacteria , " Dr. Ramsey explains . <p> The number of people who use a hot tub between cleanings also makes a big difference . The hot tub we used had been full of wedding guests all weekend . That could have overloaded the system with bacteria , says Dr. Ramsey . " The higher the concentration of people , the more pseudomonas is shed . Skin cells are shed too , which provide nutrients for the bacteria to grow . ( When I think back , I do remember noticing that the hot-tub water had been a little murky . ) <p> Nonetheless , the pseudomonas infection is uncommon . " It 's not the first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Dr. Ramsey . " I see only three or four cases a year . " <p> The good news is that the infection is not serious and most often clears up by itself within a week or two . Tougher cases may require antibiotic therapy , however . <p> That 's why it 's important to tell your doctor if a hot tub may be the source of your rash . Folliculitis caused by pseudomonas requires a different type of antibiotic than the more common forms of folliculitis caused by other bacteria . The wrong antibiotic may make things worse . <p> There are some rare cases in which pseudomonas infects the ears or the eyes . These can be more serious . For ear infections , which make the ears painful and tender , doctors are using a new powerful type of oral antibiotic called ciprofloxacin . <p> Eye infections can be serious and should be treated by an ophthalmologist . They might even require topical antibiotics . <p> Pseudomonas folliculitis has been traced to swimming pools , as well as hot tubs and whirlpool spas . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Ramsey . <p> " For each cubic foot of water in a swimming pool , the number of bathers is much smaller , " he says . The cooler water and lack of whirlpool jets also help the chlorine do its job of disinfecting . <p> But what about other infections besides pseudomonas ? Is there anything else you can catch in a hot tub ? I placed a call to the Centers for Disease Control to find out . <p> It seems that in extremely , extremely rare cases , people have caught Legionnaires ' disease , a form of pneumonia , from whirlpools , says Mary Reichler , M.D. , a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta . " Legionnaires ' disease is caused by inhaling droplets of water that contain the bacteria Legionella pneumophila . " Whirlpools do n't spray much , so they 're a very uncommon source of the illness . <p> And in case you were wondering ( I was ) , there are no documented cases of sexually transmitted diseases being spread in hot tubs . " These kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC 's Robert E. Johnson , M.D. , M.P.H. , of the division of STD/HIV prevention . SENSIBLE SOAKS <p> Meanwhile , what 's the would-be mellow person to do when confronted with an opportunity to relax in a hot tub or whirlpool bath ? Eyeball the water . If it looks murky , do n't get in , says Richard Berger , M.D. , clinical professor of dermatology at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey . Avoid crowds . If a lot of people are using the tub , do n't get in . And plan to use a hot tub early in the day or immediately after you see that it 's been cleaned . Do n't take evening soaks , after dozens of people have already stewed , says Dr. Ramsey . Be nosy . Ask the owner or attendant how often the water is changed . Some experts recommend changing the water every three months . But Dr. Berger thinks every four to six weeks is better . Dr. Ramsey feels the water should be completely changed after every 250 times it 's used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tub to 5 to 10 minutes . The less time you spend in the water , the less bacteria you come in contact with . Shower before you bathe . A quick rinse may reduce the skin particles and skin lotion that can be shed in the tub and feed bacteria . Shower afterward . But do n't scrub with an abrasive cloth or harsh soap . This disrupts the skin 's natural protective barrier and makes you more susceptible to infection , says Dr. Berger . Ask about chemicals . The Centers for Disease Control recommend that water in hot tubs be maintained at a pH of 7.2 to 7.8 with a free chlorine level of 1 to 3 milligrams per liter ( 1 to 3 parts per million ) . Some experts recommend free chlorine levels as high as 5 parts per million . Levels of pH and disinfectant should be monitored regularly . If you 're using your own tub , make sure it measures up . <p> " Bromine is a better disinfectant in hot tubs than chlorine , " says Dr. Berger .

" If you keep your bathing suit on , you keep the bacteria-laden water pressed against the skin , increasing your chances of developing a pseudomonas infection , " says Dr. Ramsey . <p> <p> PREVENTION CLINICS presents real-life medical experiences .
