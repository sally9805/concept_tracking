<p> DO N'T BUY NONSENSE ABOUT A CHANGING IRAN <p> Editor  --  It was wonderful seeing Martin Cruz Smith 's August 13 Open Forum piece on Faraj Sarkuhi , a jailed and tortured journalist who had the temerity to ask for intellectual freedom . <p> In the rush for oil in Central Asia and Iran 's propaganda campaign to clean up its global reputation and thereby get the pipeline route , we might find ourselves buying into the nonsense that " Iran is changing . " <p> There is no doubt that the public is sick to death of their theocracy , as evidenced by the vote for the least obnoxious of the candidates available to them in their recent election . But to think that their leader-elect can really do something about the stranglehold of the clergy is naive . <p> Before we think of lifting the embargo from Iran and making nice with the new leadership , we should have another look at the sad face of writer Faraj Sarkuhi , and remember that thousands more like him are in prison for nothing more than wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great tradition of modern liberalism , Robert Commanday , " Imagine America Without NEA " ( Open Forum , August 11 ) , wants to have it both ways . In support of NEA funding , he quotes Jane Alexander to show that the arts can have a positive effect on behavior . A few paragraphs later , he refutes those who criticize the NEA for sometimes funding filth by writing " Never mind that there 's never been any evidence that art influences the moral standards and behavior of observers , either for good or bad . " Which is it ? Art either influences behavior or it does n't . <p> Also , his portrayal of what would or would not have occurred had there never been an NEA does n't stand up to scrutiny . He himself writes that 56 percent of Americans are willing to be taxed $ 10 to support the arts . This is a sum at least five times greater than the current level of NEA funding . There is nothing preventing these people from contributing their ten dollars to a local arts organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Commanday is correct in one regard . The Constitution makes no mention of the arts . But it does mention free speech . And compelling people to finance art they dislike and disapprove of is a violation of free speech rights . <p> BILL McGREGOR <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> BRIDGE RETROFIT FUNDS <p> Editor  --  While I appreciate the personal encomiums about Senator Bill Lockyer , Governor Peter Wilson and me in your August 6 editorial complimenting the compromise which furnishes the financial means to retrofit state-owned toll bridges for seismic safety , the editorial confuses and misleads readers in one major respect : You state the compromise provides $ 875 million in state funds with the balance " coming from the Bay Area in higher tolls over the next eight years . " To the contrary , the final agreement provides that approximately $ 1.6 billion will emanate from state funds which include Proposition 192 seismic bond proceeds and the State Highway Account . The higher tolls over the next eight years constitute approximately 35 percent of the total . <p> Moreover , all revenues from the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Carquinez span , expanded access lanes and other improvements promised voters by Regional Measure One in 1988 are transferred from Caltrans to our regional programming agency , the Metropolitan Transportation Commission . <p> Senator QUENTIN KOPP <p> ( I-Daly City ) <p> . <p> DEVELOPER RESPONDS <p> Editor  --  Jon Carroll tried hard to convey the beauty and the magic of the Filbert Steps and the Grace Marchant Garden . It is easy to understand his profound love and appreciation for one of the most magical places in the city ; it is much harder to understand his careless disinterest in fair reporting and the underlying facts surrounding his August 7 column . Carroll , who spent hours consulting with the opponents of the Alta Street project , rejected an offer to meet with us and our architects to see the plans and model and instead spent approximately five minutes talking with me on the phone . Carroll made clear that detailed information was not necessary since he was a " columnist . " Had Mr. Carroll taken the time he would have learned the following : <p> We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to its preservation . We have offered to convey through deed or easement the entire rear portion of our property to expand the existing Grace Marchant Garden . <p> A shadow study prepared at the PG &E; Energy Center indicates that our project casts no shadow on the existing garden . <p> The current project represents a complete and costly re-design undertaken after more than a dozen meetings with neighbors over a two-year period and amounts to a 25 percent reduction in the building size . <p> We continue to be available to discuss the project further although some of the opponents have admitted that they want no building on the site as they enjoy newly created views across the now vacant lot . <p> These facts would have made for a more balanced account but been less entertaining that the puff piece he chose to write . <p> JOHN WILLIS <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> DE YOUNG AND THE PARK <p> Editor  --  To : de Young Museum trustees . Look at your city as a great art exhibit . <p> You would n't put a Picasso into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the de Young Museum into the Golden Gateway/Embarcadero Center , America 's finest example of urban planning ? <p> Also , step out of your own building and look at the long revered cultural facilities surrounding it , the heart of our great park . Think about the de Young 's removal as if a Botticelli were stolen from a Renaissance exhibit . <p> Defend your artistic integrity in the same manner and tell the park that the removal of the de Young Museum is simply non-negotiable . All of your problems are the park 's problems to help solve , or it , too , will be guilty of destroying itself , San Francisco 's famous urban artistic treasure . <p> HAROLD L. MOOSE , Jr . <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> UNDERGROUND DE YOUNG <p> Editor  --  Regarding the debate over the de Young , I would suggest keeping it in the park . Put it underground with underground parking access from Fulton Street ; JFK Drive could be closed . Give the bike coalition and the environmentalists what they want and do the de Young a favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first in the world  --  a true S.F. landmark ! This would provide ample space , safety , climate control , flexibility in accommodating large exhibits , etc. , with a park setting above it , pleasing to the art patrons , the environmentalists , the taxpayers , et al . <p> Should it be determined that the de Young is not to remain in the park , the best suggestion I would have is the old unused S.F. reservoir and park area bordering on Bay , Chestnut , Hyde and Larkin  --  but , again , underground with parking . <p> ROBERT CLUTTON <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> SAVE FRESH START FARMS <p> Editor  --  All that crowing by the mayor and the supervisors about that wonderful budget they came up with , and they still could n't find enough to keep Fresh Start Farms going ? Here 's a program that should be the darling of any politician : one that addresses the homeless problem by enabling the homeless to help themselves . Not only that , it 's partly self-supporting , and there are plenty of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep contributing as well . <p> Here 's an idea : if the extra nine people for the Mayor 's Office of Protocol have n't all been hired yet , how about eliminating just one of these positions and using that salary as seed money ( no pun intended ) for Fresh Start Farms ? That would provide more good PR than a party or a mayoral junket . Maybe a business consultant could donate some time to help maximize the investment . Please , everyone , let 's save this valuable program . <p> KRISTIN ANUNDSEN <p> San Francisco
