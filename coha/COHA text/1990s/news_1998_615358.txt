<p> While much of the metro Atlanta area and the nation concerned themselves with the results of last Tuesday 's general election , Grady Upton had one unrelated thing on his mind  --  survival . <p> " I 'm just trying to get enough now to get a motel room ' cause it 's cold out here tonight . " <p> Upton , 28 , lives on the streets . Has for at least a month now . " I had n't had a shower in about three weeks , " he said , not long after putting out a cigarette on the concrete below his feet . He sits atop a stone just off an I-75 exit ramp . A sign on a strip of a cardboard box that says , " Homeless Any Help Thanks , " rests between his scuffed fingers . <p> Wearing a tan sweater , tan slacks , white socks and black shoes that may once have been called dress shoes , the former Morrow resident  --  who said his mom kicked him out of her home  --  has made a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramp for the Henry Ford II Avenue/Central Avenue exit . <p> The site and its nearby interstate bridge , which straddle Atlanta and Hapeville , have become a gathering spot for many who say they are homeless . They attract some sympathy , some scorn and plenty of attention from motorists , merchants and officials around the area . <p> " She said she was n't gon na pay for no grown man , " Upton said of his mother . His father , he said , died a year ago . <p> " I ca n't help I ca n't work . She knows I have seizures and stuff , and nobody will hire me because I get hot and have seizures . " <p> Upton has a deep gash slightly above his right eye and a scratch on his right nostril . He says he received both while trying to rest underneath the Central Avenue bridge . In the midst of his sleep , he had a seizure and fell onto the adjoining concrete surface . <p> It 's not the first time something similar has happened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while painting , he said . That job  --  six months ago  --  was his last . <p> Most of Upton 's days are now spent not far from Atlanta 's main post office on Crown Road . When the brown-haired and bearded Upton tires of sitting , he paces , hands in pockets , his brown eyes turned down . <p> His language is startlingly polite , as he answers " Yes , ma'am " to strangers . And he 's hoping for better days , starting with Social Security benefits . <p> " I 've been denied three times , " he said . <p> Patti Patterson , deputy public affairs director for the regional office of the Social Security Administration , verified that Upton has been turned down before , but could not say why . Patterson also advised Upton to file an appeal , adding , " I 'll keep a check on it and we 'll see what happens . " <p> What happens on many fronts for Grady Upton remains to be seen . Right now , he 's just one of dozens of individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling to find a means to survive during the day . For many  --  a few with a pet dog or cat by their sides  --  the solution is solicitation ( what some consider nothing more than begging ) of money from drivers . A key spot : the very location where Upton often camps , battling the heat of the lingering summer temperatures and the chill of the recent fall breezes . <p> " I feel for him , " said Angie Aporo , who , while waiting for the light to change , reached his hand out the window to give Upton three dollars . " I 've been down before but I have n't been that far down , " he added . <p> Not everyone 's as sympathetic . Hapeville Police Chief Leverett Butts hears more than enough complaints from residents and City Council members alike . <p> " We tell them to move on , but they know they 're in Atlanta , " Butts said . " If it was in the city , we could try to move them on . We 've tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramp . I 've complained to ( Police ) Chief ( Beverly ) Harvard and she said she was going to bring it up at her next staff meeting . " <p> Like some of the same people he receives the calls from , Butts wishes he could do something but says his hands are tied because " just to the right of the ramp is Hapeville . " The ramp falls within the jurisdiction of the Atlanta Police Department , he says . <p> " We are monitoring that location and at this point , we have not found the individuals to be in violation of the statute as written , " said John Quigley , media and public information officer , speaking on behalf of Harvard . <p> " If we have found them in violation , they have been cited . " <p> Georgia law says it is a crime to solicit anything using force , and " no person shall stand on a highway for the purpose of soliciting employment , business or contributions from the occupant of any vehicle . " <p> But that does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name is Joe Adams . About 9:30 p.m. , Adams , smoking a cigarette and wearing dirty black jeans , work boots and a navy Miller cap , stands parallel to Upton 's typical spot  --  waving down traffic exiting from the southbound side . His visual plea  --  also written on cardboard : " Homeless &; strandit . Please help . " <p> His story : he needs enough money to buy gas for his Ford pickup so he can get home to Griffin . Otherwise , he says , he 'll be sleeping in his fuel-less truck parked in the lot of the nearby Chevron convenience store .. <p> Meanwhile , at the Chevron store , only a handful of cars are in the lot . No truck . Nearly half an hour later , a Ford F-150  --  with a man behind the wheel  --  appears . Adams walks up , gets in on the passenger 's side and frantically urges his companion to drive off . <p> Inside , full-time cashier Laurie Poole has a ringside seat . Poole , who 's worked at the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ever see them buy food , " said Poole . The common purchase : cigarettes and sometimes beer . " They get a little money , that 's what they get . " <p> Two days earlier , 45-year-old Ricky Smith sat underneath the nearby bridge drinking beer with a female companion . Smith , who also said he is homeless , has converted an area beneath the bridge into his temporary home . A blanket , pillow , something to drink , including sodas , are about all he needs . " I do n't ask nobody for nothing . I make my way the best way I can . " Making his way means working odd jobs ; his latest was with a labor pool . <p> " You do what you can to get by here . I 've watched a lot of my friends die in the streets . " <p> Barefoot , Smith wears blue denim overalls , no shirt underneath . He 's oblivious to the fact that his pinky toe is bleeding , apparently from a glass cut . He 's surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquor bottles . Behind his head , next to his domain , is another person 's spot . Two loaves of bread , a pillow and blanket mark the territory . <p> Sleeping there may mean trouble , though . Not with fellow sidekicks . But with the law . <p> State maintenance engineer Steve Henry admits the Georgia Department of Transportation does n't " go out beating the bushes looking for that sort of thing , " but he says some could be breaking the law . <p> " If it comes to a point where there 's damage to a bridge or property , " said Henry , " if it 's aesthetically a problem for the traveling public  --  underwear hanging out , food remains , that sort of thing  --  then it becomes a problem . " <p> Said Smith , " If they ask me to leave , I 'll leave . But I do n't hurt nobody out here . " <p> As for solicitation , " We have to get them off ( the highway ) when we see them , " said Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law enforcement to assist us . " <p> Sometimes , Henry said , that is n't always the solution . " You have people who have sympathy for the homeless . " <p> Upton has learned that firsthand . " They see us all the time and they do n't say nothing , " he says , referring to Atlanta police officers . " Some of ' em will help you out . " <p> Help from passers-by , he says , nets him around $ 20 each day he 's out on the ramp . Election day , a local church brought him two bags of goodies : a pair of pants , checkered shirt , belt and brown dress shoes . <p> " It 's tough out here , " said Smith . " We 're not criminals . We do n't hurt nobody . We 're good people . " <p> Seizures are the reason he ca n't work , says Grady Upton , soliciting money in the traffic island at an I-75 exit ramp in Hapeville . Upton says he has been homeless for a month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breeze ( left ) , with his dog Midnight , sits for a while with Ricky Smith , a fellow homeless man . / DOUG SMITH / Special Photo : Scrambling : This homeless man is one of the many that sit on the off-ramp of I-75 in Hapeville asking for help . / JOHNNY CRAWFORD/ Staff
