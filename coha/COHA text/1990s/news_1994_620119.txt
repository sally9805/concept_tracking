<p> Call it the miracle on Aldergrove Street . <p> Against odds that at first seemed insurmountable , members of a young family are getting back the way of life they lost last January 17 when the 6.7-magnitude Northridge earthquake knocked their home off its foundation . <p> In 20 seconds of terror as timbers snapped , walls groaned , windows exploded and objects crashed , Apolinar and Yolanda Gonzalez fled with their three small children into the clammy predawn darkness of the Olive View District to confront a new reality : For some quake victims , the greatest relief effort in the history of the United States offered little solace . <p> This is the third article that The Chronicle has published on the Gonzalezes , whose misfortune was first detailed on the morning after the quake . The other related article dealt with their neighborhood in the aftermath of the disaster . <p> It took a very squeaky wheel , the involvement of a U.S. congressman and the Gonzalezes ' monumental perseverance to get the couple on the road to recovery . Their story , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it got better . <p> " Basically , it never ends , " said Gordon Micklos , who with his wife , Angela , rallied the community and muscled politicians to get involved . " The only way people get anything is to absolutely dehumanize themselves to the point that something can be done . There is no help in this system . " <p> In the summer of 1993 , Apolinar , who works as a metals plater , and Yolanda , a bank clerk , put up their life savings and cash borrowed from friends for the down payment on a $ 198,000 tri-level on Aldergrove Street . It was their dream home  --  a place to raise their children on a quiet hillside overlooking the San Fernando Valley . <p> Before the calamity , it took everything the couple had to make ends meet . The quake left them with a 30-year , $ 158,000 mortgage on an uninhabitable dwelling . They had no earthquake insurance , no place to live and no assurance that their lives would ever be made whole again . <p> Like other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disaster assistance centers that were set up all over Los Angeles by the Federal Emergency Management Agency . She asked for immediate help with rent , for a $ 200,000 low-interest rebuilding loan from the Small Business Administration and , failing that , a $ 12,000 family grant from the state . <p> She moved her family into the two-bedroom home her mother shared with her three brothers . Six weeks passed before the Gonzalezes got their $ 3,450 rental assistance check that was supposed to tide them over for the first three months . They bought a second- hand trailer to ease their crowded living conditions . <p> LOAN DENIED <p> The SBA denied their loan , and the city of Los Angeles slapped a notice on the door of their derelict home , informing them that it would be demolished in 10 days . <p> " We did n't qualify for the SBA loan , " she said in an interview at the time . " If my loan amount goes from $ 158,000 to $ 377,000  --  and the new house is still only worth $ 200,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I talked to a lawyer and asked him if the mortgage company might be able to give us back some of the down payment . He said , ' No dear , you need to walk away . ' " <p> But the Gonzalezes were not ready to admit defeat and lose their down payment . They believed their home might be saved by less drastic means than tearing it down and rebuilding from scratch . Yolanda took her case to City Hall and won the first of several demolition delays . <p> In the meantime , Micklos , a project engineer for General Telephone whose own home suffered more than $ 100,000 in damage , burned up the phone lines seeking help for the Olive View District , where almost a third of the 145 homes were either red- or yellow- tagged , indicating damage so serious that they were either public hazards , like the Gonzalezes ' house , or unsafe to occupy . <p> Wherever the residents turned , they had trouble finding anyone who was interested in their plight , they said . <p> In the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein . " We soon figured we were n't getting anywhere dealing with the senators ' offices , so the only thing we had left to do was to get involved with ( Representative Howard ) Berman ( D-Mission Hills ) . The answer we got was , just more or less , ' We 'll take it under advisement . ' " <p> LETTER FROM THE UNION <p> It was not until the United Auto Workers Union wrote Berman , on behalf of its membership and Micklos ' next-door neighbor Steve Bjorkman , whose home also sustained more than $ 100,000 damage , that things began to happen . On a rainy Saturday in March , more than two months after the quake , Berman 's staff turned out in Olive View with a full complement of disaster aid officials . For the first time , the neighborhood began to get some recognition . <p> For the Gonzalez family , the experience was bittersweet . Their lender , Western Financial Savings Bank in Irvine , agreed to a temporary moratorium on their mortgage payments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them move rent-free into a house that was under foreclosure . <p> It was then that the Gonzalezes made a grim discovery about their dream home . The Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety published an earthquake survival brochure , using for its cover a photo of the Gonzalezes ' house as it looked after the devastating Sylmar quake of 1971 , when Yolanda was only four years old . The place looked worse than it did after the Northridge quake . <p> " If I had seen that before buying the house , I would have said , ' I 'll keep looking , ' " Yolanda said . " That 's exactly what happened again . It looks like they did not rebuild . They just repaired . " <p> Even the seller 's disclosure statement that is required by law when homes are sold made no mention of the earlier damage . The sellers checked the " no " box to the question asking whether they were aware of any " major damage to the property or any of the structures from fire , earthquake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that the air conditioning unit was not operating at full strength . <p> Lacking the money to wage a legal fight over the lack of disclosure , the Gonzalezes persisted in seeking help from the government . <p> Congressman Berman met with Yolanda and Apolinar . In Washington , he met with the chief of the SBA and with Bernard Kulik , the SBA 's assistant administrator for disaster assistance . <p> Kulik , in turn , obtained lists compiled by Angela Micklos of the people in Olive View who were having problems . " Bernard is a real dynamite kind of individual , and he ( got ) very involved , " said Fred Flores , one of Berman 's aides . " He said , ' We can work with ( Yolanda ) if her bank is willing to work with her . ' " <p> Reached in Washington , Kulik described the Northridge quake as " the largest thing this agency has ever handled . " It was bigger , he said , than all the disasters of recent years combined . <p> " We do our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have not been given the service they 're entitled to , " Kulik said . <p> HELP ARRIVES <p> In Sylmar , that job fell to Ed Williams , who had been sent there from the SBA 's Atlanta office . " We were assigned to help people who fell through the cracks , " he said . " The Gonzalezes were caught . That was the first one that our little center turned around . I went back to my hotel room at night , and I said , ' How could I help the Gonzalezes ? ' She was coming into the service center every other day , with her beautiful little eyes , and saying , ' Is there anything you can do , Mr. Williams ? ' " <p> He reopened their file and determined that , on the basis of income , they could qualify for a 30- year , $ 185,000 loan at 3.625 percent , if they were released from most of their existing mortgage and if they could find someone to rebuild their four-bedroom home within the loan limits . <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had sold it to the quasi-governmental Federal National Mortgage Association , a common practice among banks . <p> Barbara Darling , a vice president for Western Financial Savings Bank , said Fannie Mae agreed to take a $ 30,000 payoff from the SBA instead of the full $ 158,000 owed on the Gonzalezes ' note . <p> " Fannie Mae was very responsive , " said Darling . " For the Gonzalezes , they 'll never forget what they had to go through . I feel so happy for them . " <p> Kevin Hawkins , a spokesman for Fannie Mae in Washington , called the quake " a unique disaster " that prompted the huge agency to " do things out of the box . We immediately stopped foreclosures , imposed a moratorium on loan payments and did not report anything to credit bureaus . " <p> For the first quarter of 1994 , Fannie Mae took a $ 25 million loss , which Hawkins said was " extremely small " compared with their portfolio of 9 million loans , which average $ 100,000 . <p> Demolition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new house will be built during the next six months . Although the family increased their debt by $ 30,000 , Yolanda said the monthly loan installments will be about the same as they were before the quake because of the lower interest rate . <p> She gave credit to the determination of Gordon Micklos and his
