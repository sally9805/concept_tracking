We 'd all like to solve our problems-but sometimes the trade-offs make it hard to know what is a solution . Photograph <p> Lilly Cordova caused quite a stir when she first joined our ballet class . It was no fault of her own , even though she arrived late and we were already warming up with plies ; she slipped in silently , dropped an apologetic curtsey to the teacher , and found a place at the barre . But when our pianist looked up and saw her , his jaw dropped and he played a full eight counts in the wrong key . If he 'd been playing something less cumbersome than a piano , he would certainly have dropped it on his foot . My brother Johnny 's a musical wonder , to be sure , but he 's far too easily distracted by a pretty face . And Lilly was a beauty , no doubt about it . Glossy black hair tied back in a short ponytail , liquid dark brown eyes with great long lashes , a perfect dancer 's body-slender and delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering , and had only a few more musical lapses during the rest of the class . Most of the girls found his mistakes entertaining ( although Marianne , the teacher , did not ) . I tried to pretend that I did n't hear the mistakes , that I was n't Johnny 's sister , and that I had n't recommended him for this job . I do n't suppose I was markedly successful . No matter what Johnny played or what he flubbed , Lilly danced flawlessly . She never seemed to notice his mistakes . After I had watched her at the barre for ten minutes , I was already wondering what she was doing in this class . It was the studio 's advanced class , and all of us had been dancing on pointe for some time , but there were no future ballerinas among us . This was a quiet little class , catering mainly to students from the nearby university , along with a few kids and a few working women like me . Most of us just danced for fun and exercise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . Every move , every step at the barre was performed with incredible precision . On the floor her skill was just as great . As I watched her I began to realize that she reminded me of someone , perhaps of one of the great ballerinas of the past . There was something in her look , in the way she moved . But I could not place the resemblance . In the dressing room after class Lilly accepted the other girls " admiring comments with polite courtesy , but with no enthusiasm . She did n't laugh or smile . It did n't occur to me to wonder about that . After all , she was new here , and perhaps she was shy . And I was in a terrible hurry to get changed into street clothes ; I wanted to hustle Johnny out of the studio before Marianne decided to fire him . Johnny was waiting for me outside the dressing room door , still looking rather starry-eyed . I took him by the arm and drew him outside into the parking lot . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " She 's going to kill me . " " Mmm , " Johnny said . " OK . " " What do you mean , OK ? After she kills me she 'll fire you , and then how will you pay your share of the rent ? " " She wo n't fire me , Heather , " Johnny said confidently . " I 'm the best pianist she 's got . " I gave him a look . " Usually , " Johnny amended . He climbed into the passenger seat of my battered old Rabbit , and I gave a sigh and got in behind the wheel . I had just put the car into reverse when Johnny grabbed my arm . " Wait , " he said . " It 's Lilly . " " Oh , Johnny . " " I just want to see what kind of car she drives . Wait just a minute . " Johnny watched breathlessly as Lilly unlocked the door of a white Oldsmobile and slipped inside . As she backed out of her space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they swept past and all we could see of her car was a pair of red taillights . Johnny sighed and said , " I wonder where she lives . " " We 're not following her home . " " Why not ? I 'm in love . " " You 're not in love . You 're in lust . " " OK , so I 'm in lust . She 's beautiful . " " She is , is n't she ? " I pulled out of the parking lot , noticing with some chagrin that we were , at this moment , following Lilly 's car . Oh well , surely she would make a turnoff soon . " You know , Johnny , she reminds me of someone . A dancer I 've seen on video . But I ca n't think who it is . Does she seem familiar to you ? " " Mmm . I feel like I 've known her all my life . " " I mean , does she remind you of someone . " " Remind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe it 's just because she 's such a good dancer . I ca n't imagine why she is n't with a company . She must be nineteen or twenty ; it seems like she should be out making a name for herself . I would , if I had that kind of talent . " Which I did n't , to be sure . I grew up loving music and dance , but having precious little talent for either . Apparently Johnny got all the family 's genes for music , for when he 's not distracted by a pretty girl he 's a musical genius . Last time I counted he had mastered seven different instruments , and he composes as well . For myself , I ca n't play a note on any instrument known to man , and though I love ballet I 'm hopelessly clumsy at it . In front of us , Lilly 's car slowed and signaled a right turn . " Where 's she going ? " Johnny asked in surprise . " That 's a dead end , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed down as I approached the turnoff , wondering if Lilly was lost . After all , she was new in town . But she was n't driving hesitantly , like a lost person would . Instead she was building up speed . But there was no road where she was going , nothing but a dark empty lot full of trees . A splintering crash split the night , and Johnny cried out . For an instant I froze at the wheel , in shock , then my foot found the gas pedal and I drove as fast as I dared to the road 's end . " There she is , " Johnny whispered . " Christ ! At least it does n't look as bad as it sounded . " He jumped out of the Rabbit , and I threw it into park and followed . Lilly was already out of her car , standing in front of it in the headlight beams to examine the damage . Dust drifted around her , settling slowly toward the ground . The front bumper was bent askew , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further damage . The tree she had hit was still standing . Lilly was running her hands along the bumper when we came panting up . " Lilly ! Are you OK ? " Johnny asked anxiously . " I 'm fine , " she said . " I thought I 'd feel something more , " She touched the dent in the hood , shrugged , and got in behind the wheel . Johnny caught the driver 's door before she could close it , and I knelt in the dirt and touched her shoulder . " Lilly , are you sure you 're all right ? " " Of course . " She looked at me in some confusion . " Who are you ? " " I 'm Heather Munro . We were just in class together . This is my brother " Oh yes . The pianist . " There was a vague , unfocused look about Lilly and I wondered if she had struck her head without realizing it.Or perhaps she was in some sort of shock . " We can take you to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get checked . " " No , thank you . I 'm fine ; I 'll just go home . " " Let us at least give you a ride . You should n't drive any more tonight . " " I do n't want to leave the car here . " " Johnny can drive it for you . Come on . Please . " Lilly argued but I was adamant ; there was no way I was going to let her drive . In the end she got into the Rabbit with me while Johnny checked her car , pronounced it reasonably safe to drive , and maneuvered it back to the main road . He pulled out behind me , and Lilly twisted in her seat to look at her car . Then she settled into the passenger seat and gave me directions to the Broadmoor Motel . I knew the way to the motel quite well ; it was across from the hospital , where I worked . " Have you been in town long ? " I asked . " No . I just got here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not really . I 'm here with my moth er . She 's consulting with some of the doctors at the University Hospital . " " Oh , I 'm sorry . I hope it 's not serious . " She shrugged . " It 's been going on a long time . There 's a research program here for multiple sclerosis , an experimental treatment . That 's what she 's here for . " I nodded ; I knew about it . In particular I knew one of the research assistants , a young doctor named Tyler Mackenzie , whom I had admired from afar for months . " So what happened with the car ? " I asked . " Did you lose control ? " Lilly shook her head . " Then what happened ? " " I wanted to feel it , " she explained , " but there was n't anything to it , really . I thought it would be more exciting . " " Exciting ? " I said blankly . She shrugged . " Lilly , are you sure you 're OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little sadly . " I 'm fine . Really . " When we got to the Broadmoor Johnny and I walked Lilly to her motel room ; I was still worried that she might have some kind of head injury , and I wanted to make sure that someone was there to look after her . Lilly found her key , opened the door , and awkwardly invited us to come in . In the room a woman was sitting at the table with a book in front of her ; she looked up when we entered , and seemed startled to see us . But she could not have been half as surprised as I was . And I knew why Lilly had reminded me of one of the great ballerinas . The woman at the table was wearing a red blouse and a black skirt , and for an instant I pictured her on stage , in a red costume with black sequins sparkling in the lights , a brilliant smile on her face as she danced . I blinked , and the image was gone , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most brilliant dancers to ever grace the stage . I realized that I was staring at her almost as blatantly as Johnny had gazed at Lilly during class ; quickly I looked away . Lilly said , " Mother , this is Heather . And Johnny . They gave me a ride home from class . " " A ride ? Lilly , is something wrong with your car ? " " Not really . Just a few dents . " " She , ah , hit a tree , " I put in . " Her car seems OK except for the body work , but we did n't think she ought to drive home . " Vanessa winced , but said no more about the car . She thanked us for helping her daughter . I suggested that she keep a close eye on Lilly tonight , and we said good-bye . In a daze I followed Johnny out into the parking lot . " Do you think she 'll be all right ? " Johnny asked . " What ? " " Oh , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe it ? Her mother is Vanessa Ahrensen . " " What about it ? " " You play piano for the ballet and you do n't know her name ? Hurry up ; I 'll show you when we get home . " Back at our apartment I dug out one of my videos of Vanessa Ahrensen and popped it in the VCR . " Look at her , " I whispered to Johnny , and turned up the sound . Vanessa appeared on stage , in a flowing white dance dress , with flowers in her hair . She seemed to float across the stage , to fly into the air . Johnny watched intently , taking in her charisma and magnetism , her style and verve . " She 's extraordinary , " Johnny murmured . " Yes . She is . " We watched her dance through half the tape , then Johnny sat down on the couch beside me , picked up the remote , and pushed the mute button . On the screen , Vanessa went on dancing , in silence . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I looked . Vanessa spun in a pirouette , leaped in grand jetS , held a long beautiful pose in arabesque . I shook my head , not understanding what Johnny wanted me to see . " When you watch her dance , " Johnny said , " you can see the music . She 's part of it . " He turned the sound back on , then off again , and suddenly I understood what he meant . The music was still there , in every move and pose . Music in motion . " Does she still dance ? " Johnny asked . " No . She has n't for years . She 's got multiple sclerosis ; she ca n't even walk any more . " Johnny was silent for a long time . Then he said , " I ca n't imagine what that would be like . Suppose I could never play an instrument again ? I think I 'd go mad . " " I know . " We stayed up together and watched the video to the end , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dancing , and when I finally got to sleep that night , the dance went on in my dreams . The next morning at work I felt like the walking dead . I do n't function at all well on two hours of sleep . I stumbled through my rounds , drawing blood samples from one patient after another , thankful that I was skilled enough to hit veins even when half asleep . I 've been drawing blood for two years now and I 'm good at it ; I usually find the vein first try even on the most difficult patients . But it 's rather a thankless job . People seem to find phlebotomists even more terrifying than dentists . Finally I came to the last patient on the morning list . I checked my list against the card on the door , noted the match , and only then recognized the name . Inside the room , Vanessa Ahrensen was waiting for me . She sat by the window in a sporty motorized wheelchair , looking out at the lawns and parking lots below . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , hello , " she said . " Heather , is n't it ? Do n't tell me you 're one of the vampires . " I set down my tray of collection tubes on the bedside table . " I 'm afraid so . Sorry . " I 'm grateful for what you did for Lilly last night . " " Is she all right ? " " Yes , she 's fine . A few bruises , that 's all . I 'm glad you were there to help her . " I said , " I 'm glad we happened to be there . It was such a freak accident . " Vanessa frowned slightly , and held out her arm for me . I was suddenly nervous-I had never before drawn blood from someone I idolized-and I sighed with relief when I saw her veins , lying along her arm in a beautifully visible pattern . The tourniquet lifted the vein I wanted nicely , and I slipped the needle in with ease in spite of the attack of nerves . The first Vacutainer tube began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you as a friend . " Vanessa said suddenly . " Well , yes . I suppose so . " I switched tubes and started filling the second one . " I think I should tell you something about her , then . " " Tell me what ? " " To start with , what happened last night was n't an accident . She did it deliberately . " I glanced up at Vanessa 's face , thoroughly confused . I said , " Surely you do n't mean she ran into a tree on purpose . " Vanessa shrugged . " She 's jdone such things before . " " But why - " I broke off , remembering the odd look on Lilly 's face , and her words , I tbought it would be more exciting . " If you watch her dance for long enough , " Vanessa said , " you 'll see it . What she lacks . " The second tube was full of blood . I switched to the third one , thinking of what I 'd seen of Lilly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Johnny 's musical mistakes without even noticing . " You mean musicality , " I said hesitantly . " More than that . Passion , joy , excitement . . . these are things she does n't feel . She does n't understand music . All her dance is done to a count inside her head . When she was little her doctors thought she had autism . Then they watched her move and dance , and they said well , perhaps not autism , but something like it . They criticized me , you know , for pushing her into dance , but I did not push . She asked for classes when she was five . " Vanessa paused , looking down at her arm as I switched to the fourth tube . " Good heavens , how much blood are you going to take ? " " One more tube , I 'm afraid . They 've ordered quite a lot of tests . " " I must tell Dr. Peterson that his cure will do me no good if I die of anemia . He keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of side effects from the treatment . I should think he would also be concerned about the side effects of all this blood loss . " I managed an awkward smile , and filled the last tube in troubled silence . " Lilly has never found it easy to have friends , you know , " Vanessa said , flexing her arm as I racked the tubes . " I tell you all this so you will understand if she seems distant , or remote . Or if she does strange things , in her struggle to feel what others do . " She touched the arm of her wheelchair , moved to the window , and glanced back at me . " Thank you for telling me , " I said quietly . She nodded stiffly , and turned away . When I finished my shift that evening I went nervously looking for Tyler Mackenzie . I 'd never gone looking for him before ; we 'd only talked on the occasions that we had passed in the hall . I found him alone in the M.S. lab intent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , hesitant . I did n't want to interrupt him in the middle of something important . I was about to slip away quietly when he pushed his chair back from the screen , noticed me , and smiled . " Hi , Heather . " " Hi . How 's it going ? " " Oh , pretty well . What 's up with you ? " " I just wanted to ask you something . About the M.S. treatment . " He looked surprised . " What about it ? " I knew a fair bit about it already ; I had studied up on it when I 'd noticed that Tyler was on the project . It was gene therapy , complicated by the fact that M.S. was caused by a combination of factors ; there were two abnormal genes involved , plus a retrovirus , all working together to trick the body into attacking its own myelin sheaths . The goal of the current treatment was to stop the disease in its tracks , to prevent symptoms from growing worse with time . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronic progression . " How effective is the treatment ? " I asked . Tyler hesitated . " It 's been difficult to prove , " he said . " M.S. treatments have always been hard to evaluate because the symptoms fluctuate so much in the normal course of the disease . Symptoms appear and disappear all the time . But the double-blind tests were promising . Extremely promising , in fact . That 's how we got the approval for this project . " " What about the patients you 're treating now ? " " It 's too early to tell ; we 've only just started the treatments . But we 're very excited . It 's quite possible we may be able to stop the progress of the disease entirely . " " What about reversing it ? Will you be able to actually cure it some day ? " " Well , not yet . We 've got some good theories on inducing remyelination but so far they 're not working out in practice . But someday . . . " He grinned . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That grin transformed his face , making him look suddenly young and happy and carefree , and for a dazzled moment I completely forgot what we were talking about . But then I remembered to ask about Lilly ; I wanted to know if she was at risk for M.S. " She 's more at risk than the general public , " Tyler said . " The disease does run in families , of course . And it does n't usually manifest itself until people are young adults . " " Could it ever cause something like autism ? " Tyler frowned . " I do n't think so . Of course , we do n't know what causes autism , but I 've never heard of any kind of connection with multiple sclerosis . M.S. can affect the brain , the op tic nerve and the speech centers , and occasionally it affects the emotions , but in the opposite way ; emotions become much more labile and intense . " He stared at me suddenly . " Why in the world are you asking ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . And there 's something odd about her . About her emotions . " " How old did you say she is ? Nineteen ? " " Yes . " " You think she 's autistic ? " " No . But something 's wrong with her , and Vanessa said Lilly 's doctors have never been able to figure out what . " " Maybe I could meet her sometime , " Tyler said . " I doubt I 'd figure anything out , but who knows ? " I felt a shiver of excitement ; this was the perfect opportunity to ask Tyler out , with the convenient excuse of having him meet Lilly . I groped for words , but nothing would come . When the silence between us became awkward , I said lamely , " Well . Thanks for the info . Bye . " Bye , " Tyler said absently , and went back to his work . I walked out of the lab and into the bustling hall , feeling frustrated , and stupid , and very much alone . I got home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny in front of the mirror , checking his reflection from every angle . " What do you think ? " he asked me . " Do I look OK ? " " Of course , " I told him , surprised ; Johnny is not usually one to stare into mirrors . Anyway he always looks good , even at his scruffiest , and tonight he was dressed in a good shirt and new jeans , his long hair neatly tied back in a tail . " Why ? " I asked him . " Do you have a date ? " He smiled happily . " You bet . I asked Lilly to come down to the cafe tonight to listen to us play . " " You asked Lilly out ? " " Sure did . " " And she 's coming ? " I said doubtfully . " Well , yes , of course . Say , you 're coming to see us tonight too , are n't you ? " " Oh , Johnny . I was going to , but I 'm just so tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tyler ? " " Well , I know you like him . And I bumped into him last week while I was waiting for you to get off work , so I asked him to drop by the cafe tonight to hear our music . " I stared at Johnny . " So you 're coming ? " he asked . I nodded silently . Then I gave Johnny a push out of the way , and claimed the mirror for myself . Sad to say , the mirror did n't help much . Johnny has all the good looks in the family , too , and it did n't help that I ended up sitting at the cafe table next to the stunning Lilly . But Tyler was kind ; though he did a double take when he saw Lilly , he sat down next to me . I introduced them , they said hello , and we turned our attention to the corner where Johnny and his band were setting up . It was almost eight o'clock . Johnny joined us at our table , bright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for a moment ; I could n't hear what was said , and was a bit embarrassed when I realized that I was straining to eavesdrop . I was feel ing some turmoil ; should I tell Johnny what Vanessa had told me ? Or should I stay quiet , and let things happen as they would ? Troubled , I watched as Johnny slipped away from the table and returned to his group . Tyler leaned close to me and said , " Hey , Heather , what kind of band is this ? " He was gesturing at the band 's more unusual instruments . Johnny had his hammered dulcimer out , and Richard and Mary had a mandolin and a twelve-string guitar , while Gillian had the weird percussion and Jody her fiddle . I named off the instruments to Tyler . He said , " What 's that thing that looks like a mixing bowl ? " " Ah , well . It 's a mixing bowl . Part full of water . It has some interesting tonal qualities . " I decided not to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which chimed with different tones ; Johnny 's percussionist is talented but admittedly bizarre . " This is Johnny 's weirdest group , but it 's his favorite , " I told Tyler and Lilly . " His rock and jazz groups just play covers at clubs , but Johnny writes a lot of the music for this bunch . It 's my favorite too . " " Huh , " Tyler said . " I 'm a rock and roll man myself . So , Lilly , what kind of music do you like best ? " Lilly hesitated . Then she put on a smile , and said , " Oh , I 'm interested in most all types of music . " Then the lights went down . There were not many people in the cafe , but when the music started everyone looked up from their steaming mugs and plates of food , and listened . Some , caught by surprise , were spellbound . Others turned back to their food or their conversations , but glanced toward the musicians occasionally , and took some time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the spell of the music . The candies on the tables flickered , the strings of keys chimed , the fiddle and dulcimer sang together . My favorite song was one of Johnny 's compositions , a duet sung by Johnny and Mary , accompanied only by Gillian 's whispery chiming percussion . I glanced at my companions in the middie of the song . Tyler was mesmerized . And Lilly was bewildered . In the glow of candlelight I could see the concentration on Lilly 's face as she struggled to comprehend . I saw her darting little glances at the other audience members , noting their reactions . She glanced at me , and I hastily looked back at the band . When the number was over she smiled and applauded , but her expression and movements looked forced , as if she were following a script . Johnny caught her eye , flashed a smile at her , and started the next song . And Lilly gazed at him as he played , in a kind of puzzled wonder . When the concert was over I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and walked outside with Tyler . The parking lot was dark , and deserted except for the cafe 's patrons , all of whom were now leaving . A cold wind blew past , fluttering the LIVE MUSIC banner on the cafe 's window . My Rabbit rattled out of the lot and onto the street , carrying Johnny and Lilly and an assortment of instruments . " She looks like her mother , " Tyler said out of nowhere . " You mean Lilly . " " Yes , of course . And I do see something odd about her , though she hides it well . I doubt most people would notice . " " But you did . " He shrugged . " My sister 's autistic . There 's something about Lilly that reminds me of her , but it 's very subtle . " " Her mother told me that Lilly was diagnosed as autistic when she was little , but the doctors kept changing their minds . " " There 're a lot of different degrees of autism . Some people are completely lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in society . Like Diana , my sister . She gets along pretty well . " " Lilly dances . Ballet . Beautifully . " " Well , that would n't fit with autism . But something similar , perhaps . Hmmm . " " Do you think I should tell Johnny ? " " Lord , Heather , I do n't know . He 's your brother , you should know best about that . Anyway , what makes you think he does n't know already ? " I stared at him ; I had not even considered that possibility . But Johnny was more observant than I was . He probably did know . " Your brother 's quite a musician , " Tyler said . " Is he older or younger ? " " Younger . My parents " problem child . You should have seen the look on my mother 's face when she visited us last year and found that his hair was longer than mine . " Tyler laughed . " I can imagine . " " My parents were so glad when he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure I 'd be a good influence , and I 'd convince him to change his ways . I 've never had the heart to tell them that it 's not going to happen . I do envy Johnny sometimes , you know . I wish I could have some of his musical ability , some of his carefree attitude . " " I do n't know , " Tyler said . " I think you do all right with what you have . " " Thanks . " I knew I was blushing , but it was probably too dark for him to tell . " How old is your sister ? " " Fifteen . She 's still in high school . She lives with my folks back in Colorado . I do n't see them much . Actually I have n't seen much of anyone since I started work with Dr. Peterson . The work takes so much time , and you always feel like you should be working faster , harder . Especially when you start meeting patients , like Vanessa . " " I see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the lab once in a while . A change of pace , a fresh start . " " Maybe so . " Tyler shivered and stuck his hands in the pockets of his jacket . " So , can I drive you home , since your brother 's run off with your car ? " " You sure can , " I said happily , and he opened the door of his car for me . I was still awake when Johnny got in that night . I had no business being awake , since I 'd been up almost the whole night before , but I could n't stop thinking about Tyler . Anyway , I had tomorrow off , and could sleep all day if need be . I heard Johnny come in , heard various hangings and bumpings as he got his instruments through the door and into his room . Then I heard the rustling of papers for a time . Perhaps Johnny was looking for a particular piece of music , or perhaps he was changing the pictures on his work wall . Yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compose his music . Do n't ask me how . He says he reads them like a music score , and plays what he sees , but it 's never been something I 've understood . After a time I heard the soft notes of a flute . The music was simple and spare , in a minor key . Each phrase of the song seemed to reach for something , sad and longing , never finding what it sought . Usually music can put me to sleep , which is a useful thing when you live with a nocturnal musician . But this music was disturbing , and though the flute was soft and low the music was no lullaby . I got up and went to Johnny 's room . He did n't know I was there at first . He was sitting cross-legged on the foot of his bed , flute in hand , a rumpled notation book in his lap . Every so often he paused in his playing to scribble on the book in his lap . Each phrase he played was different , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the doorway for a long time , watching and listening , and Johnny played the last phrase , made his last notation , and put down pencil and flute . He was deep in thought , as quiet and pensive as I had ever seen him . He looked up then , and saw me . " Heather , what re you doing up ? I thought you always slept through this stuff . " " I do . Just not tonight . I have n't gone to sleep yet . And that music . . . what are you playing ? " I looked at his wall . The waterfalls were still in the places where they had been earlier , but this music had not sounded in the least like a water fall . " It 's not on the wall , " Johnny said . " Just a picture in my mind . Lilly . " " Oh . " And I understood why the music was so sad , so full of longing ; why it seemed to be missing something . And I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew about Lilly . " She ca n't feel things , Heather . She wants to ; she sees others doing it , but she ca n't . " " I know . " " But maybe I can help her . " " Johnny , she 's been searching all her life , and a lot of people have tried to help . " " Yeah . But I 'm the one falling in love . " " In love ? But Lilly ca n't feel love , can she ? " " Most people can , but they do n't . Lilly ca n't , but she tries . She looks for it , even if she 'll never find it . That makes her special . Do n't you see ? " It was Johnny 's typical convoluted logic , but I did see what he meant . Somehow Lilly had touched him , deeper , I thought , than any girl ever had before . But this relationship was hopeless from the start , and it made me sad , and tired . I gave Johnny a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week I did n't see much of Tyler , but I dropped by the lab occasionally , and once he came and said hello while I was on duty , and he always seemed glad to see me . So I was happy enough . And Johnny saw Lilly almost every day . He took her to the mountains and to the zoo , to rock concerts and to symphony orchestras . He took her to music stores where she could sample a hundred different types of music ; he took her to movies and candlelit dinners , and when she asked him to , he took her to bed . The next morning , when I was getting ready for work , I saw Johnny sitting disconsolately on our little sofa , staring into space . I rubbed my eyes and looked again ; he was still there , and he was awake . Johnny is never awake in the morning . " Johnny ? You OK ? " He glanced up , and shook his head . I sat down beside him and said , " It 's Lilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked down at the sofa and tore a piece of worn thread out of the fabric . " We slept together last night . She asked me to . She 'd seen it on movies and TV , listened to people talk ; she thought it would make the difference . And so did I , you know ? " " And it did n't make a difference ? " " No . " Course not . I took her home just before dawn , and I started crying on the way , and she touched my face and looked at me , and she did n't know why I was sad . Nothing 's changed for her . Maybe it ca n't change . " " I do n't think it can , Johnny . " " Does n't matter , though . I still love her . " " I know . " I sighed and got up from the sofa ; I was going to be late for work . " Come on , Johnny , go to bed . You have to play for ballet class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to . " " Well , you have to . You 're behind on your share of the rent . Way behind , I might add . " " All right , " he said listlessly . " I 'll go . " It was n't easy , but I got Johnny out of the house and into the ballet studio that night . He sat at the piano , uncommonly morose , as the girls entered the studio and started to warm up . When Lilly came in , he caught her eye and his face lit up with happiness . She looked back at him , gave him an acknowledging , automatic smile , and went to the barre . Poor Johnny . It was going to be hard for him . The class began , and though Johnny 's playing lacked his usual energy and vigor , he made no mistakes that I could hear . We warmed up with barre exercises and then moved out to the floor . We started out diagonally across the floor , one by one , chaines turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang up onto pointe and started across the floor in precise half circles , legs and back perfectly straight , arms graceful and controlled . I watched her enviously ; I was terrible at chaines turns . I saw Johnny glance up at her , over the piano , and his music suddenly became stronger , more compelling . The tempo changed subtly , and Lilly hesitated fractionally , almost visibly adjusting the count in her head , and then danced on . Johnny was trying to touch her through the music , but it was n't going to work . It hurt to watch , but I could n't stop looking . And then Lilly faltered . She lost her balance , wobbled a bit trying to regain it , and fell off pointe halfway across the floor . There was an audible gasp from the other girls . This happened to everyone else , especially me , but not to Lilly . Never Lilly . She never stumbled or fell . But there she was , in the middle of the floor , gathering herself to start the turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before losing her balance again and coming to a stop . The music stumbled with her , and Johnny called out anxiously , " Lilly , are you OK ? " " I 'm fine , " she said . " My legs are just tired . " She curtseyed apologetic ly to Marianne and crossed to the opposite corner for the next set of turns . Nonplussed , Johnny returned to the piano , and class went on . Lilly 's turns on the opposite diagonal were as flawless as usual , and so was her dancing for the rest of the class , but when we walked out of the studio she looked tired , which was n't at all usual for her . " Do you feel OK ? " I asked her . The cool night air of the parking lot felt wonderful on my face , but Lilly still looked strained . " I do n't know , " she said . " My legs do seem tired . " " There 's the flu going around , " Johnny said . " Maybe you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " Lilly said again , looking puzzled , and abruptly she fell to her knees in the gravel . Startled , Johnny caught her arm and helped her to her feet , and she stood for a moment brushing dirt and bits of rock off her legs . I touched her face ; there was no fever that I could detect , but without doubt something was quite wrong with her . We refused to let her drive . Johnny took her home in the Rabbit , and I followed , driving Lilly 's Oldsmobile . Lilly 's car smelled new . I touched the passenger seat as I drove ; it was spotless . There was no trash on the floor , no papers strewn on the back seat , nothing hanging from the mirror or stuffed in the glove box . It occurred to me , as I drove , that the car was as perfect , and as sterile , as Lilly 's dancing . As Lilly was herself . Lilly felt fine the next day , but the day after her symptoms returned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a multitude of tests , but the bloodwork revealed no abnormalities . The MRI and the genetic tests held the answer ; Lilly carried both of the defective genes for M.S. , and her MRI showed distinct plaques of demyelination in the spinal cord and brain stem . When my shift was over I went to visit her . I found her sitting in a chair by the bed , leafing idly through a magazine . " Hi , Lilly , " I said . " How are you feeling ? " " Fine , thank you . My legs just get tired now and then . I suppose after a while I 'll have to stop dancing . " I looked down at the floor . " I 'm sorry . " " Oh , I do n't mind . I do n't really get anything out of dance , even after all this time . " " Why do you dance , then ? " " Because of Mother . " " Because she wanted you to dance ? " " No , no . Because of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's this look she gets on her face when she just thinks about dancing ; it 's joy , I guess . I wanted to know what that felt like . I thought if I practiced hard enough , or for a long enough time , I 'd find out . You know . " " Yes . But it did n't happen ? " " Oh no . But I got used to dancing . It 's comfortable , I suppose . A routine . " I did n't know what to say . Lilly turned her head slightly , to glance out the window , and I was struck by her expression ; her face was serene , untroubled . The prospect of giving up dance , of living with a potentially crippling disease . . . it did n't trouble her at all . I wondered if that was something to be grateful for . On my way out through the halls that night I ran into Tyler . Literally . I was walking along staring at the floor and wondering how I might react to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Tyler came around a corner with an armload of papers . We collided , but fortunately he was able to hold on to the papers . " Sorry , " I said . " I was n't looking where I was going . " " Me either . Well , no harm done . Are you off for the night ? " " Yes . " " Good , good . I 'm headed home myself . It 's been quite a day . " " Yes , it has . Well . . . good night . " " Good night , Heather . See you later . " He was off then , down the hall to the doctors " parking lot , and I was left alone with all the things I could have said . Such as Would you like to come over ? I 'll make dinner or Johnny 's playing at the cafe on Friday ; want to come ? or Can I interest you in a movie ? But , I told myself , the time was n't right . He had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the night working on them . Another time would , no doubt , be better . I was almost to the parking-lot door when it opened and Johnny came in with a blast of cold air . He was windblown and out of breath . " Heather ! " he said . " Glad I caught you . Can you give me a lift home after I 've seen Lilly ? " " Sure , " I said , " but visiting hours are over . " " I know . I could n't get a lift from Charlie 's ; I had to walk . It 's freezing out there . " " Charlie 's ? You came all the way from Charlie 's ? " It was five miles , at least . " Yeah . Come with me , OK ? You can show me the best way to sneak in . " " Johnny- " " Please ? " I groaned , and gave in . When we slipped into Lilly 's room she was sitting up in bed with her magazine . Johnny crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took her hands . " How are you doing ? " he asked . " I 'm OK . " " Good . " He reached inside his jacket and pulled out a single yellow rose . " For you , " he said , handing it to her . She took it hesitantly , looking at it as if she had never seen a rose before . " I 've got to go now , " Johnny said , " before Heather drags me out . It 's past visiting hours and you need your rest . But I want you to know I 'm thinking about you . I 'll see you tomorrow , OK ? " She nodded . He kissed her gently and turned to go . As we slipped out the door I glanced back at her . She held the rose in one hand , gazing at it , and lifted her other hand to her face , lightly pressing her fingers to her lips . Then the door fell closed behind us , and I followed Johnny out into the hall . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny . " Ah , where exactly did you get it , between here and Charlie 's ? " " It was a big bush , " Johnny said . " There 's lots more roses on it . " " As I thought . " " It 's just not fair . " " What 's not fair ? Privately owned rosebushes ? " " Lilly . I mean , her dancing ability is really all she had . Now she does n't even have that any more . " " I know . I was just thinking , at least none of this upsets her She does n't really care . But there 's something awful about that , too . " He nodded sadly , and I put an arm around his shoulders , and walked him out to the car . Over the next few weeks Vanessa continued her treatments , and began a campaign to get Lilly admitted to the experimental program . The red tape was phenomenal , but Vanessa was wealthy and influential , and she had funded a great deal of the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting Lilly admitted were poor " It was hard enough for us to get Vanessa in , " he said , " and Lilly 's much younger and much less ill . She wo n't be considered a good candidate for something experimental . " I thought that seemed strange , since they were trying to stop the course of the disease , not cure it . Surely the ideal time to do the treatment would be early on , when the symptoms were still mild . Tyler shrugged and agreed , but said that red tape was red tape . Time passed , and Lilly returned to her routine . She went to class as usual , but her dancing had lost its perfection . Often she grew tired , or stumbled , or lost her balance , and after a few falls she stopped wearing her pointe shoes . Soft shoes were safer . Of course none of this seemed to bother her , but it was distressing to me . And to Johnny . When I left dance class with Johnny and Lilly on the night before Thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of , and the snowflakes drifted slowly down to land on our hair and coats . " Oh great ! " Johnny said happily . " Snow . I love snow . " " That 's because you do n't have a car , " I said , looking at the Rabbit to see how much snow I was going to have to scrape off . " Oh , come on , Heather , it 's barely even freezing . The roads are clear ; there 's no ice . It 's beautiful . " " Hmph . If you like it so much , you scrape the snow off the car . " " It is beautiful , " Lilly said . I looked at her in surprise ; she sounded as if she meant it . She gazed up for a moment , watching the snowflakes spin down out of the clouds . Then she said , " I 'm going to start the treatments . Mother got me into the program . " " Oh , Lilly ! That 's wonderful , " I said . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holiday . " " That 's good . " Johnny took her hand . " Really good . " I said , " I wonder how she swung that ! I never thought she 'd get through all that red tape so fast . Your mother 's really something , Lilly . Is she going to come for Thanksgiving dinner ? " " Yes . We 'll be there at six . Thank you for asking us . " " Do n't thank me ; Johnny 's doing the cooking . " " And it will be excellent , " Johnny said . " Lilly , where 's your snow scraper ? " I ended up scraping the snow off the Rabbit after all , while Johnny attended solicitously to Lilly 's car . We were both wet and shivering as we drove out of the parking lot . Johnny brushed snow out of his hair and rubbed his hands in front of the Rabbit 's heater . The heat did n't seem to be working very well . " So what are we having for Thanksgiving ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's stop by the store on the way home . " " OK . It 's nice that Vanessa 's coming , is n't it ? " " Yeah , it is . And Lilly . Listen , Heather , why do n't you invite Tyler ? " My heart jumped a little ; I had thought of it as soon as I 'd found out Tyler was staying in town for the holiday . " I do n't know , " I said . " I 'm not sure he 'd want to come . " " Then ask him , and find out if he wants to come . " " I just do n't know if he 's really interested in me . He has n't called or anything in a long time . " " You have n't called him either , and I know you 're interested , " Johnny said reasonably . " Come on , be spontaneous . Invite him . Meet him at the door in a glamorous dress , with a flower in your hair . " For a moment I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet was an elegant violet silk dress that my mother had given me . I could wear that , and when Tyler came I could I returned to reality in a rush , and navigated an icy patch of road . " I could n't do that , " I said . " Why not ? " Johnny asked . " I just could n't . He could n't possibly be interested in me , anyway . He 'd probably think I was crazy if I threw myself at him like that . " " Oh , Heather . I think maybe he 'd like it . " " I think maybe he would n't . I ca n't , Johnny . I just ca n't . " Johnny sighed , and remained thoughtfully silent for the rest of the drive to the store . Thanksgiving dinner was interesting . Johnny had gone for the semi-traditional effect , which this year meant that there were bits of smoked turkey in the cheese-and-mushroom omelets . Vanessa raised her eyebrows when her dinner was set before her , and Lilly looked surprised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omelets Johnny served hot tea and cookies . I was warming my hands on my teacup , wondering where Tyler was right now and what he was doing , when Vanessa asked Johnny to play for her . " Sure , " Johnny said . " What do you want to hear ? " " Oh , I do n't know . Something you love to play . Anything . " Johnny disappeared into his room for a moment , and emerged with a guitar in one hand and a flute in the other . He played a few pieces on the guitar at first , then switched to the flute . Vanessa listened with rapture . Johnny launched into a set of dance tunes , and after a moment Vanessa closed her eyes and began to sway to the music . It hurt to watch her , sitting there in her chair , when she so obviously longed to be dancing . I tried to imagine how Vanessa would dance to this music if she could , what steps she might use , how she would look dancing here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could see her . I blinked and turned to face her . She was still sitting in her chair , but she was motionless now , her hand pressed tightly to her mouth . She was staring not at Johnny , but at Lilly , who was no longer at the table . Lilly was dancing . And I had never seen her dance like this before . For a stunned , confused moment , I could not figure out what was different . Then I saw it . Lilly 's face was alive with expression . Her body moved with the music , from her toes to her fingertips , as if she were a part of it . I stole a glance at Johnny ; he was trembling and he looked like he was about to drop the flute , but he somehow managed to play on without missing a note . Lilly lifted her arms , looking up exultantly , and spun across the tiny floor . In the middle of a turn , Lilly 's legs buckled and she fell . The music halted just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the floor with a silvery metallic clank , then bounced twice and rolled into a corner . Johnny knelt on the floor in front of Lilly , and helped her up . " Oh , Johnny , I felt that , " she said in amazement . " I really felt it ; I understood it . I really did ! Oh- " She fell against him , tumbling to her knees before Johnny caught her and lifted her back up . " My legs have gone very strange . " " Can you stand ? " Johnny asked anxiously . " No , I do n't think so . " Johnny helped her to a chair and she sank into it gratefully . Vanessa wheeled quickly to her side , her look of wonder changing instantly to alarm . " Lilly , your legs . How do they feel ? " " It 's strange . Weak , and kind of numb . I suppose it 's just the M.S. getting worse . " Suddenly she looked frightened . " It is getting worse , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would happen so fast . " Vanessa took her hands . " It does seem fast , I know . But you 'll start treatments next week , and they 'll help , I just know they will . They have for me ; I 've had no progression at all since starting them . And they should work even better for you . " " I 'm frightened . " Vanessa sat for a moment , mouth open , as if she had no idea what to do . And how would she know ? Had her child ever been frightened before ? Finally , hesitantly , she reached out and took Lilly in her arms . On the Saturday after Thanksgiving , Tyler was at work In the M.S. lab , setting everything up for Lilly 's first treatment on Monday . I peeked in through the doorway ; no one else was there . I took a deep breath and went in . " Heather , " Tyler said . He looked surprised to see me . " Hi . Can I talk to you for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Lilly . She 's had some really dramatic changes . " He frowned . " The symptoms are that much worse ? What 's happened ? " " The symptoms are worse , I suppose , but that 's not what I meant . She 's started feeling things . On Thanksgiving she was listening to Johnny play his flute , and all of a sudden she could feel the music . She understood it . And she was frightened about having M.S. She was n't frightened before , you know . " " I know , " he said softly . " Is this still going on ? " " Yes . Sometimes it 's more intense than others , but ever since then , yes . " " And the M.S. symptoms ? " " Her legs seem worse . But that kind of comes and goes , too . " " And she 's never had feelings like this before . " " No . Never . " Tyler sat silently for a time , staring blankly at his computer screen . Then he shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it . " " That 's what I thought . " He said , " Lord knows it probably is a coincidence . They do happen . All the time . But I wonder . . . you know , she does have brain stem lesions . " I looked at him in confusion . He caught my look and explained , " A few patients with brain stem attacks have emotional lability . The slightest thing can make them laugh or cry ; the feelings are so strong that they 're literally overwhelming . I 've got one patient who has to take tranquilizers and antidepressants just to function . " " Then the M.S. might be what 's giving Lilly these feelings . " " It 's possible . " He stared at me for a moment , then shook his head . " But there 's no way to know for sure . " " Oh . " " But whatever the cause , it 's such a marvelous thing for her , to be able to feel , after all this time ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny 's music . " " Must have been great . " " Yes . " The door flew open abruptly and Dr. Peterson hurried in with an armload of folders . He nodded to Tyler , dumped his folders on another desk , and sat down with a sigh . " Excuse me a minute , " Tyler said . " I 've got to ask Dr. Peterson something , and it 's best to catch him before he gets buried in his papers . " " Sure , " I said . He crossed to Dr. Peterson 's desk and I bit my lip ; as soon as he got back I could say We 're taking Lilly to the cafe tonight , and Johnny 's playing . Why do n't you come ? But then I remembered how he 'd looked at me when I 'd come in . Surprised to see me . Startled , really . Perhaps it would be better to leave well enough alone . After all , here I was , poorly educated , no artistic talent , plodding along in a dead-end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician in his right mind would be interested ? So when Tyler returned , I thanked him politely for the information , and walked away . At the cafe that night I sat with Lilly in the candlelight , listening to Johnny and his band . They played exceptionally well that night , inspired , no doubt , by Lilly . She sat perched on the edge of her chair , her face rapt , leaning forward as if to capture every nuance of the music . Johnny never took his eyes off her , and I knew he played and sang for her alone . At the end of the first set the band took a break , drifting out into the audience for drinks and conversation , and Johnny went straight to Lilly . " Will you show me the instruments ? " Lilly asked , and Johnny took her by the hand , leading her from fiddle to dulcimer to percussion . She touched Gillian 's keys experimentally , setting off a rippling chime , and peered curiously at the mixing bowl . She played a few notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled at her in a way that I had never seen before , a dizzying , breathtaking smile , and took her in his arms . She held on to him tightly , holding on , I knew , to someone she suddenly and unexpectedly loved . It was a beautiful sight , really . But painful for me . If only someone would smile at me like that If only someone would hold me like that . On Monday morning Lilly went to the hospital , leaning on a cane , and politely refused treatment . Vanessa and Dr. Peterson were utterly shocked ; Tyler was not . I was n't surprised either , though neither Tyler nor I had talked to her about our speculations . She had obviously speculated a bit herself . After a brief and emotional argument , Vanessa wheeled off in tears , and Dr. Peterson shrugged and philosophically returned to his office . Lilly turned to Tyler , looking troubled . " You understand , do n't you ? " she asked . " Yes . " " I did n't decide this lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast it 's progressing . But I just ca n't take any chance of losing this , this . feeling . " " You must understand that you may lose it anyway . There 's no way of knowing for sure it 's the M.S. that 's causing it , or if it will last . " " I know . I 've thought about all that . It 's frightening . " She shivered , then shook it off , and smiled . " But I 'll take every minute of it that I can get . I feel alive now , like I never did before . " " I know . " Tyler smiled back . " I can see it . " I could see it too , ever so clearly . She ca n't feel love , Johnny had said , but she tries . And now that she could feel , she was alive with feeling , glowing with it . Unlike so many others . Most people can feel it , Johnny had continued , but they do n't . They just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the room and walked away , alone in the crowded corridors of the hospital .
