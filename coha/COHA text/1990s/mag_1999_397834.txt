A brutal test of brains , endurance , and the ability to make funny noises <p> May 7 , World Series minus 8 days and counting : Oh , for heaven 's sake . I 'm not threatening to kick down the locker room door and interview anybody naked . I do admit to trying to set up interviews with a World Series team , but we 're talking about the World Series of Birding . <p> I 'm negotiating by phone with John Fitzpatrick , director of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology . A scrub jay and flycatcher specialist , and the discoverer of several South American bird species , he 's a key player on that World Series powerhouse the Sapsuckers . In a week plus a few hours , Fitzpatrick and four lab colleagues will match wits with 57 other teams in the oldest and most famous birding contest , sponsored by the New Jersey Audubon Society . <p> In its 16th year , the event has evolved a variety of subcategories , but the Sapsuckers are going for the main event , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duck . To win , a team has to identify the most species within a specific 24 hours in New Jersey . <p> New Jersey ? <p> Absolutely , Fitzpatrick says . The Atlantic Flyway , the path that millions of birds take northward from their winter homes to summer breeding habitat , sweeps up through the Garden State . I see that the spring migration brings avian rush-hour traffic in the skies , so what better place to watch it than New Jersey ? <p> As I explain how I want to follow an all-scientist team in this event , I 'm struck by the undercurrent in Fitzpatrick 's usual easy charm with the press . Today he 's still charming , but there 's the sound of handling-a-situation , as if I 've said something really shocking . <p> Indeed I have , but I wo n't realize this for a week . What I 've done , in my naivete , is ask if I can ride in the Sapsucker van . <p> After all , in the 1992 World Series , a writer for the Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to give a first-hand account of such key events as the finding of a mourning warbler , even though she did have to take a bus home from the finish line when the team wanted to keep on birding . <p> The event may drive birders delirious with pleasure , but it 's murder for avian-sports reporters . Each team picks its own starting point , anywhere in the state . There is one finish line , thank goodness , but teams reach it by any path they choose , zigzagging along routes they revise at the chip of a sparrow . <p> Although a speeding ticket knocks a team out of the contest , the event retains a road-race zest . Since all top contestants can recognize hundreds of species in the dark a quarter mile away , the amount of territory covered can be decisive . <p> The driving abnormalities of birders in general-sudden swerves and slow-downs , exotic lane changes and pullovers-multiply as tension builds . Even if a reporter in a chase car could manage not to lose a team 's van or die backing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporter 's vehicle screeching to a halt could scare away a bird . In which case , a reporter could come to an untimely end after an attack with a spotting scope . <p> In retrospect , I recognize that Fitzpatrick reacted with amazing calm and generosity . We do not discuss how the reporter-laden Tyrannulets came in 20th , whereas the Sapsuckers ranked first among out-of-state teams last year and this year are serious contenders to float their ducks in that big silver trophy . <p> Fitzpatrick explains that much more than Sapsucker honor is at stake . Cornell lab supporters have pledged about $550 per species that the team finds , and he hopes to log more than 210 . The time for one more person to clamber in and out of the van , the extra chance noises that might drown out a distant trill , the distractions of dealing with a stranger-he puts it delicately , but in essence , an extra person might cost his team a bird . <p> Nevertheless , Fitzpatrick offers to confide the team 's beginning location so I can at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 days : Is this for real ? I might as well be searching for Jimmy Hoffa . The tentative information I have is that the Sapsuckers will meet me Friday night in the Great Swamp of New Jersey . At midnight . <p> WS minus 4 hours : Fitzpatrick has phoned with a reassuringly normal-sounding dinner invitation from two of his lab 's board members , JoAnn Little and Randy Little . When I reach their home near Basking Ridge , N.J. , a map of the state drapes the kitchen table , and five already sleep-deprived Sapsuckers surround it . Team captain Ken Rosenberg , grassland bird specialist Jeff Wells , and crow expert Kevin McGowan have finished reports on long days of scouting missions , and neurobiologist Steve Kelling is strategizing the attack on South Jersey . This table , where they plan the route , could be where they win or lose . <p> Fitzpatrick writes a tidy schedule on a legal pad . To reach the kind of numbers they want , they have to average finding a bird about every 7 minutes , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule marches down the fifth page , JoAnn Little calls the team to a steak-chicken-pasta feast . In 1997 , before she became Sapsucker chef , McGowan consumed a deli sub around 3 a.m . The team still talks about that sub since McGowan developed food poisoning in the van during the contest . Of course , he did n't drop out , and he credits plastic bags with saving the team a lot of unscheduled roadside stops . <p> A mild uproar breaks out when I ask what keeps people from adding a few extra warblers here and there . Birding honor remains strict , they say , and cheating is n't as easy as it may sound . The teams become acutely aware of bird whereabouts , so anomalies stand out . Also , this year , each team can report only one bird that its members alone find . <p> What also ruffles the Sapsuckers ' feathers , although they do n't call it outright cheating , is another team 's legendary response to the speeding-ticket ban . A certain group ( Fitzpatrick goes ostentatiously vague about its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive . " They wo n't give tickets to one of their own , " Wells explains , as the dining room electrifies with outrage . <p> Several years ago , a siren and flashing lights interrupted the Sapsuckers en route . Deep in ornithological debate , they 'd forgotten to keep an eye on the speedometer . The trooper eyed the van , asked if they were with the World Series of Birding , and then said , " Got a bald eagle yet ? There 's one down that way . . . . " <p> The Sapsuckers thanked him for his directions and then faced the dilemma that the eagle , which they could have used , seemed too far away . Yet ignoring a trooper 's tip posed its own risks . The team continued driving its planned route , but very carefully . <p> WS minus 20 minutes : Thanks to logistic difficulties-involving permits and gate keys-and Sapsucker big-heartedness , I am riding in the van for the start of the contest . My original request , I see now , was no more shocking than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capsule and watch the guys land on the moon . <p> The van has more room than the Apollo cockpit , but not much . More dire is the issue of psychic space . This is not your average bird walk , and these are not well-rested people . I can see that in a few more hypertense hours , the Sapsuckers will face a danger of spontaneous combustion . <p> McGowan starts a scramble among the gear when he mentions that somewhere he has packed a Cornell cassette of nocturnal calls to play in the van . Many migrants fly at night , and their flight calls often do not resemble the sounds the average birder recognizes on the ground . <p> The search stops when Kelling points out that they all know the tape by heart , anyway . " Imagine you 're standing outside on a warm summer night . . . . , " an oily , mock-announcer voice from the back seat mimics the tape 's introduction . A surprisingly realistic Canada goose honks next to my ear , and then the van fills with imitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clacks , hoots-the whole avian world simultaneously and on fast forward . Fortunately , we do not meet a state trooper . <p> WS minus 5 minutes : The Sapsuckers have taken their first position in the swamp . Standing on what I hope is solid ground , I see them as dim gray shapes just ahead of me . On either side , the swamp drops into blackness . It 's chilly . <p> Even though it 's almost midnight , team members wear their binoculars , all from their Austrian sponsor Swarovski Optik . It 's not just habit . McGowan hands me his to try , and I 'm surprised to see images a little brighter than they appear with the naked eye . <p> " Virginia rail , " Kelling says suddenly , though the team ca n't count any birds that they hear before midnight . <p> The Sapsuckers orient in one direction and grow still again . I realize I wo n't be able to take notes because the felt-tip pen makes too much noise . <p> A Canada goose , a real one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The team shifts with disgust . <p> There 's a distant hoo-ing- " who cooks for yoouu " is the traditional birders ' mnemonic-and several voices call out , " Barred owl . " Then , there 's a collective , clipped " Ah . " The rail has apparently called again . <p> I have n't heard a thing that could be a rail during these last few minutes . Or have I ? The team falls into listening stillness again , and I wonder if that little . . . No , that 's faraway traffic . And that 's the wretched goose . And that . . . could that be a bird ? Or the call of my own pulse ? <p> A sudden , multibarreled burping , nearby and thunderous after all the strained listening , nearly launches me into the swamp . I hear Fitzpatrick , in a mockery of the birders ' ID call , announce , " Green frog . " <p> May 15 , WS 12:02 a.m. : " Barred owl . " <p> Good . Fitzpatrick has been lobbying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goose . Which honks almost immediately afterwards and ranks as second bird . <p> The rail calls again , apparently . I 'm awed at how the Sapsuckers pick out birds from the faint rustles , hums , and creaks of the swamp at night . <p> After a sora rail and a marsh wren call , we move . By some long-established team consensus , Rosenberg is the one to imitate king rails . We fall silent . He steps forward , pauses , then makes several breathy grunts . <p> Later , listening to a bird-call tape , I realize just how good Rosenberg 's imitation was . Could n't mimickry confuse birders nearby , I ask him after the event . " We know for a fact that we 've been counted by other teams " in other years , he says . <p> Still , good ears can tell . Rosenberg remembers one maddening night when rails were n't responding to his best efforts . In an overcaffeinated meltdown , he burst into his imitation of a South American bird . From the darkness , a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The other birder had n't seen Rosenberg for several years but recognized the call . <p> As well as imitating calls , the team sometimes claps and then freezes to see if birds reply . At one point , Rosenberg pelts the swamp with pebbles . Sometimes the tactics work . <p> The team finds more than a dozen species in the swamp , including a great horned owl , a yellow-breasted chat , and the only black-billed cuckoo they encounter during the contest , this one recognized by its flight call . <p> The team also finds other contestants and at one point gets stuck in a three-van gridlock on a narrow , overgrown lane . <p> WS 1:42 a.m. : The Sapsuckers are in high spirits as the van jounces out of the swamp . They drop me at my car , wave , and head north . The roadside suddenly seems so quiet I wonder if I 've dreamed it all . <p> WS 4 a.m. : After an intense survey of several miles of route 22 , I find the motel where I 'd made reservations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read myself to sleep , but Peterson 's Field Guide proves too stimulating . I give up and start driving south to see how the teams are doing . <p> WS 11:30 p.m. : I 've seen a lot of entertaining birds and people during the day , but no Sapsuckers of either sort . Here at the finish line , at Cape May Lighthouse , two rooms fill with giddy teams of birders bug-eyed with fatigue . This year 's World Series includes two teams named Orioles plus teams called the Lyric Cassowaries , the Wandering Tattlers , Wild Bird Center of America Re-Tailed Hawks , the Not Too Swifts , the Wrending Talons , and the Green Mountain Goatsuckers . <p> WS 11:50 p.m. : The last teams are crowding in now . I see no Sapsuckers . I do find John Sterling of the Smithsonian 's Woodpeckers , sponsored by Bushnell Sports Optics . He looks glazed but says his team has broken 200 species for the first time . <p> WS 11:59 p.m. : Still no Sapsuckers . <p> WS midnight : At last . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kelling , and McGowan are standing in a shell-shocked clump . They say they nearly ran out of gas but made it to the only service station still open in Cape May . They reached the lighthouse without a second to spare . <p> They 've had a roller-coaster day . By 9 a.m. , they had 137 species , more than their wildest hopes . Then , they got stuck in beach traffic on I-80 , losing 40 minutes . <p> Remembering their 30-second stops , I dread to think about the mood in the van . " Morale was low , " Kelling understates . <p> Fearing they 'd blown the best lead they 'd ever had , they soldiered on , and by 5:30 p.m. , they 'd tied their previous record of 204 species . They heard their last new species , a yellow rail , one of the rarest birds in New Jersey , about 9 p.m . <p> And their score ? " 220 , " says Kelling . <p> I 'm about to whoop , when Kelling explains that the Delaware Valley Ornithological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the Sapsuckers fumed in traffic , the home team had chosen back roads in north Jersey , logging three grassland species the Sapsuckers never picked up . <p> The Sapsuckers again win the trophy for the best out-of-state team , but they 're still eyeing the top prize . Next year , they 'll be back at the kitchen table . <p> By Susan Milius <p> Birding for science <p> The energy that birders , both amateur and academic , bring to their pursuit could easily power a medium-sized city , once a few technical details get ironed out . In the meantime , ornithologists are exploring how to harness this zest to collect data over a range far beyond the ken of a single research team . Says Jeff Wells of Cornell University and a member of its birding team , " It 's a new era of citizen science . " <p> Among the projects in which scientists have used data gathered by volunteers : <p> A survey of more than 2,000 sites suggests that tanagers in mid-Atlantic states and the Midwest are more sensitive to the fragmentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The data were reported in the June Conservation Biology . <p> A new analysis of the volunteer Breeding Bird Survey estimates the impact of forest fragmentation , according to a presentation in June at the 1999 meeting of the Society for Conservation Biology . <p> Papers in several publications , including the April 1998 Journal of Wildlife Diseases , are tracking the spread and impact of a house finch disease . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Cornell Sapsuckers ( left to right , front ) Ken Rosenberg , Jeff Wells , ( back ) Steve Kelling , Kevin McGowan and John Fitzpatrick prepare to spend a tough day in New Jersey to defend their trophy and to raise funds for surveys of cerulean and golden-winged warblers . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Yellow-bellied sapsucker <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : King rail <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Cape May warbler <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Cerulean warbler <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Barred Owl <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Scarlet tanager <p> By Susan Milius <p>         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
