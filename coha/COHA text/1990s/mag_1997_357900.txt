Whenever Newt Gingrich needs a little extra motivation to keep off the 30 pounds he has lost since summer , all he has to do is look at Bill Paxon . Paxon is the lean , boyish , irrepressibly upbeat Congressman from upstate New York who might have become Speaker of the House last July if the attempt to overthrow Gingrich had succeeded . The coup failed , Paxon was forced to resign his leadership post and Gingrich has since reasserted a semblance of control , over both his weight and his troops . <P> But his once loyal lieutenant has not skulked away in ignominy . In fact , Paxon 's star is rising again , thanks to an aggressive seduction campaign by his fellow House Republicans . As Gingrich has surely noticed , the man who would succeed him has been busy shuttling around the country , raising money for his colleagues and storing away political IOUs for the moment the post-Newt era arrives . Gingrich 's loyalists are feigning indifference in public while fuming in private . " Paxon betrayed his own mentor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want ? " <P> For some of Paxon 's peers , all of whom face re-election next November , the answer is yes  --  the sooner the better . " When I think of whom I want to see as the face of the Republican Party , " says Oklahoma 's Steve Largent , " I think of Bill Paxon . " Largent is one of the group of disgruntled conservatives who fomented the rebellion that nearly toppled Gingrich . But Largent and others like him say that even if Gingrich has improved as manager of the G.O.P. majority , this has n't eased the burden imposed on all Republicans by the Speaker 's dismal public-approval ratings . " He 's still less popular than O.J. Simpson and the Unabomber , " complains Largent . " The baggage he carries , we carry . " <P> And for Republicans tired of Gingrich , Paxon , 43 , is the perfect antidote . Where Gingrich has said he wants to be " the leading teacher of 21st century American civilization , " Paxon sheepishly admits to being " a regular guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And while Gingrich is famous for his discourses on subjects such as the democratic possibilities of information technology , Paxon 's whole political philosophy can be summed up in three phrases : cut taxes , shrink government and above all , elect Republicans . That Paxon does n't have Gingrich 's expansive intellectual range  --  or combativeness  --  suits many of Paxon 's compatriots just fine . Republicans are winning most of the major political arguments of the day , they say ; their problem is style , not substance . " Being conservative and mean are not synonymous , " says Representative Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , referring to Gingrich . " Conservatism is popular . We 've got a good message ; we just need a good messenger . "
