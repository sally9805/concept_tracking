VARSITY TEAMS : 22 INTRAMURAL SPORTS : 22 FAMOUS ALUMNI : JOHNNY RODGERS , MIKE ROZIER EXTRA CREDIT FOR : 28 STRAIGHT BOWL APPEARANCES // The Nebraska weight room is the envy of every other athletic department . It stretches over 30,000 square feet deep within the catacombs of Memorial Stadium . This mecca of muscle and might , the largest weight facility on any campus . is the foundation of Nebraska athletics . It is used four times a week by virtually every varsity athlete and is why , as strength coach Boyd Epley puts it , " Nebraska has its reputation for being a power football team . " // Cornhuskers fans , among the nation 's most sports-crazed , gave Nebraska more than $700,000 toward the construction of the weight room in 1981 and an expansion in ' 90 . " It shows you how seriously people take their athletics in Nebraska , " says Epley . Since the state has no pro sports teams or other major universities , there 's nothing around to threaten the fans ' fidelity , especially to the football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold out for every game since 1962 , why close to 50,000 fans are expected at this Saturday 's spring game , and why the Cornhuskers ' media guide is annually a best-seller at the campus bookstore . ( Keep in mind one other fact : Some 93% of the students are Nebraskans , an unusually high percentage even for a state school , and they have been following the Huskers all their lives. ) // The lucre that the athletic department generates does n't all get put back into varsity sports . Nebraska 's massive recreation center , which houses a student weight room larger than some varsity weight facilities in the Big 12 , was financed by private donations and a $2 surcharge on football tickets . At the rec center you can always find a decent hoops game on one of the eight courts , but come May the crown jewel of the place will be a 42-foot-tall climbing wall . // The university lies just north of downtown Lincoln , a 1950s kind of place . There is n't a lot to do in town , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred events . The place to be before a game is Barry 's Bar and Grill , where the favorite libation is tomato juice and beer . The tailgating scene around the stadium is relatively tame , and the campus fraternities are officially dry ( wink , wink ) . Perhaps that explains why Nebraska fans may be the best-behaved fans at any big-time football school . Win or lose , the folks in the north end of the stadium give a standing ovation to the opposing team as it heads to the locker room after the game . The ovation the Cornhuskers crowd gave Bobby Bowden 's Florida State team after an 18-14 Seminoles win in 1980 so moved Bowden that he wrote an open letter to the fans that appeared in the Lincoln Journal-Star . " I have never seen people with more class than I saw at Nebraska , " wrote Bowden . " The Nebraska fans , players , cheerleaders , band , officials , coaches , etc. , gave me living testimony of what college football should be all about . " // Lincolnites follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehend . " There is absolutely no separation between town and gown , " says Michael Steinman , associate dean of the arts and science college . " University athletics play about as prominent a role in Lincoln as is imaginable . " No fewer than 66 businesses in town use Cornhusker , Husker or Big Red in their titles . All of these enterprises are trying to associate themselves with a glorious tradition : In the last 20 years Nebraska 's football team has won two national championships ; its men 's gymnastics team , eight ; its women 's track team , three ; and its women 's volleyball team , one . // School officials are quick to give credit . " It 's really the fans that make sports special at Nebraska , " says associate athletic director Don Bryant . " With only 1.5 million people in the state , sporting events at the university become the events of the year . And that , in a nutshell , is why Nebraska is unique . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
