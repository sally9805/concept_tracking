You name it , we skied it crud , bumps , ice , steeps , cliffs , cornices  --  in our first-ever coast-to-coast situational ski test . // SOMETIMES THINGS THAT ai n't broke are still worth fixing . Our ski test , for one . This year , we went bonkers and completely redesigned it , ending up with eight different ski tests , 12 test sites , 21 days of testing , 55 ski testers , 60,428 centimeters of white masking tape . It was huge . For years , SKIING has run what 's widely known as the best ski test in the biz . Our test has been praised for its thoroughness , its accuracy , and its integrity . Like scientists , we had created a laboratory experiment for measuring ski performance , collecting data , analyzing numbers , and eliminating as many variables as possible . Testers would take two runs on each ski , at the same area , on the same day , on the same run , making the same turns , taking the same line in the bumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bottomless powder , the fun of a fat carve on a perfect corduroy carpet , the heart-in-your-throat feeling of launching air too big for your britches ? You ca n't . Skiing is a sport , after all , not a statistic . Also , skis are evolving : Some are shorter ; some have more sidecut , some less ; some are expanding at the waist , some are shrinking . All-terrain skis are designed to be more versatile than ever , while skiboards and hypercarvers are made for specialized situations . How people are skiing is changing , too : Skiers are ducking into trees , hucking cliffs , exploring the backcountry , playing in the halfpipe . The trick is finding the right ski for the right situation ... and finding the ski that 's right for the situations you get into . We 've always found that ski testing has an inherent subjectivity to it ; what one tester likes in a ski , another does n't . It depends on the tester 's physiology , skiing style , snow conditions , and terrain . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a factor . We decided to embrace that reality and create a real-world test .

To qualify as a ski tester , you have to have neat handwriting : McKinnon fills out a test card ( inset ) . // We broke all the test tubes , smashed the petri dishes , and came up with the kinds of situations that real , live , warm-blooded skiers find themselves in . We conducted tests all over the country , taking skis into every possible condition-from powder to ice , from Sugarbush to Squaw , using testers from hairbag cornice-hoppers to ski instructors to ripper wannabes . The end result : We skied the test boards in this Buyer 's Guide in more varied conditions than ever before . We skied small groups of test skis at different areas , on separate days , on a variety of terrain . We encountered the spectrum of snow conditions . At the East test , for example , we set up camp at Okemo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four inches of mixed powder and gunk the next . A week later , we took the same test batch to Sugarbush , where we were met with frozen crusties the first day , a soft blanket of freshies the next . Some skis were included in up to three different tests at up to five different mountains . And because the situations were different every time , the reviews of the same ski sometimes varied from one test to the next . On the following 36 pages , you wo n't find numbers and statistics and definitive winners and losers . What you will find is a series of critical reviews based on ski experiences in real situations . Our veteran ski testers found this to be our most revealing test yet . We 're sure you will , too. - THE EDITORS This Buyer 's Guide has tons of information . So much , in fact , that just finding the right ski test ( out of the eight we conducted for 1999 ) can be like trying to get crosstown on the subway during Manhattan rush hour . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Just answer the questions and follow the arrows , and you 'll wind up at the ski test ( or tests ) that 's right for you . Answer the questions realistically , and you 'll have the skis of your dreams at your fingertips . Fib a little , and you 'll be doing some extra reading-not that there 's anything wrong with that .
