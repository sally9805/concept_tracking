Chapter 1 : Bloodfool things , " said Mink , the words tangled in his mouth with potato and ham , the stubbled cheeks flexing as he chewed , " what about that fool that brought the can of blasting powder into the kitchen and put a match to it to see if it would burn . A fool thing , and half the town on fire on account of it and him and his brother 's whole family dead or torn up . " " What the hell is this ? " said Dub , pulling something from the mashed potato on his plate . " What the hell is this ? " holding up a bloodied Band-Aid . " Oh my lord , " said Jewell , " Throw it out . Take some new potato . I cut my finger peelin ' potatoes , then when I was settin ' the table I see I lost the Band-Aid somewhere . Must of fell in the potatoes when I was mashin ' ' em . Give it here , " she said , getting up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She moved with a quick step , her lace-up oxfords with the stacked heels showing off her small feet . " Thought for a minute there , " said Dub , " that the taters had the rag on . " " Dub , " said Jewell . " I do n't get it , " said Mernelle . " I do n't get what a bomber was doin ' near the Camel 's Hump . Is there Germans on the Camel 's Hump ? " Dub roared in his stupid way . Mernelle could see the thing at the back of his throat hanging down , the black parts of his teeth and the empty gums on the left where the train men had knocked his teeth out . " Do n't worry about the Germans . Even if they made it across the ocean what the hell would they do up on Camel 's Hump ? ' Ach , Heinz , I am seeink der Blood farm und der dangerous Mernelle collecting ze milkveed pods . ' " Dub 's grin hung in his face like an end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mink had sent it along , the ham hanging a little over the edge , the cone of potato rising , a single iceberg from a frozen sea . Loyal stood up , the yellow kerosene light reaching as high as his breast , his face shadowed . His leaf-stained fingers bunched , braced against the table . " Got something to say . Billy and me has had enough of this place . We 're pullin ' out tonight . She 's waitin ' for me right now . We 're pullin ' out and going out west , someplace out there , buy a farm , make a new start . She got the right idea . She says ' I 'm not even goin ' to try to see my folks . Suit me good if I never have to see one of them again . ' She 's just goin ' . I wanted to set it straight with you , give you some idea . I did n't come back for no goddamn dinner . Did n't come back to listen to horseshit about Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my car . Ask you to tell her folks she 's gone . She do n't care to see them . " As he said it he knew that 's what they should have done . It seemed so easy now he could n't understand why he 'd fought the idea . There was a silence . A discordance spread around the table as though he had blindly hit piano keys with a length of pipe . Mink half-stood , the hair hung down over his eyes . " What in hell are you sayin ' ! This your idea of a joke ? All I ever hear from you for ten years is how you think this place ought a be run , now you say just like you was talkin ' about changin ' your shirt that you 're pullin ' out ? For ten years I been hearin ' about what you wanted to do with this place , how you wanted to switch off the Jerseys over to Holsteins , ' get a milkin ' machine after the War as soon 's we get electricity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hayfields up , alfalfa , build a silo , grow more corn , concentrate on commercial dairy farmin ' . Profit . Put the time into dairyin ' , do n't bother with no big garden , or pigs or turkeys , it 's quicker and efficienter to buy your food . I can hear you sayin ' it now . You said it until my ears turned blue . Now this . You expect me to swallow this like sweet cake ? " Hey , mister , tell you what else you said . You bitched and whined about the juniper movin ' into the fields , talk half an hour about the orchard , suckers , deadwood , the bull spruce is chokin ' out the spring in the pine tree corner you said , west hayfields ai n't been cut in three year , full of cherry trash . That 's what you said . Said you wished the day had forty hours of light so 's you could get somethin ' done . " Loyal hardly heard him , but saw the rubbery folds from the wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the cords in Mink 's neck , thought of the glistening strings just under the skin , thought of the arteries swelled with ropes of blood the size of his finger , thought of the crackling sound of rib bones when he kicked in a fox 's chest . " You ca n't leave us run this farm alone , " said Mink in his buzzing voice , the self-pity getting into his rage . " Jesus Christ , your brother 's only got the one arm and my health is down since the damn tractor laid on my chest . I was up to my health I 'd beat the shit out of you . You 're not worth a pig 's patootie . You tell me how in the hell Dub and me can hand-milk nineteen cow alone , two of them damn Holsteins of yours , the one holds her milk back , and kicks . Christ I hate that cow 's eyes . You son of a bitch , we just ca n't do it . " " Goddamnit , the Holsteins are good-natured cows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give damn near twice as much milk as any Jersey . " He tumbled into the relief of the old argument . " Yes , and look how much they eat . And half the butterfat of the Jerseys . The Jerseys is made for this country . They can make out on thin pasture and keep a farm going . They 're rugged . Tell you another thing . You just try walkin ' off the farm they 'll have your ass in uniform so fast it 'll take your breath away . There 's a War on , in case you forget . Farm work is essential work . Forget out west . Do n't you read no papers ? Do n't you hear no radio programs ? Them out west farms dried up and blowed away in the Dust Bowl . You 're stayin ' . " Dub popped a wooden match with his thumbnail and lit his cigarette . " I got to go , " said Loyal . " I got to . Oregon or Montana  --  somewhere . " " Put the record on again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dance to that one . " The smoke streamed out of his nose . Jewell put her hands to her cheeks and drew down on them , stretching her face and exposing the red inner lids of her eyes behind her glasses . " I do n't know , " she said . " What about the Army Dinner , we 're puttin ' on the Army Dinner Saturday night , the big beef stew dinner in the cafeteria style , Army style . I was expectin ' you to take me down to the church on Saturday mornin ' . You can stay for that . Billy 's one of the ones that wears the chef 's hats and ladles out the food . She has to stay for that . " " It 's on Billy 's account we got to go tonight . There 's certain reasons . No good to talk about it . I 'm goin ' . " He leaned wildly at them , the black hair curling at the opening of his shirt where the blue-white skin showed . " Well Jesus Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . She wants to clear out so nobody do n't know . There 's a word to describe a fella like you lets himself get backed into a rutty corner where he ca n't turn around , " the voice squeezed along , " but I wo n't say it in front of your mother and sister . " " Hey , you leave , Loyal , " said Dub , " you 're finishin ' off this farm . " " Well I knew this was goin ' to be like takin ' a bath in boiled shit , but I did n't know it was goin ' to be this bad . Ca n't you understand nothin ' ? I 'm goin ' . " He ran up to the slant-ceilinged room he shared with Dub , leaving the ham on his plate , leaving his chair turned away from the table , leaving the fly-spotted mirror reflecting Mernelle 's face . He hauled out the old valise , opened it and threw it onto the bed . And stood a long minute with the shirts bunched up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Down there Mink was firing up , bellowing now , something smashing and rattling  --  door to the pantry . Loyal dropped the shirts into the valise , and afterwards believed that was the moment when everything shifted , when the route of his life veered away from the main line , not when Billy slumped beneath his blind rutting , but as the shirts collapsed in their cotton limpness . He found Dub 's bottle in a boot in the closet , tightened the cap arid tossed it in , working the stiff strap through the valise buckle as he came down the stairs double-stride , hearing Mink hammering now , seeing the son of a bitch nailing the kitchen door shut . So he could n't get out . He was across the room in a few seconds . He kicked out the window and stepped over the raking glass onto the porch , leaving it all , the trapline , the rough little Jerseys , the two Holsteins with their heavy flesh-colored udders , Dub 's oily rags , and the smell of old iron in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods . That part of things was over . It was over in a rush . Down on the town road he thought it was a sour joke how things had turned out . Billy , always yapping about moving away , getting out , making a new start , was staying on the farm . He , whom never thought beyond the farm , never wanted anything but the farm , was on his way . Clenching the steering wheel . Something was sticking in his backside , and he felt around , grasped Mernelle 's ocarina , the swirled novelty pattern of the Bakelite scarred from kicking around the floor . On the sides were decals of donkeys carrying panniers of cactus . He started to crank down the window to throw it out , but the window slipped off the rail again when it was only a crack open , and he threw the ocarina into the backseat . It was almost dusk , but at the low place where the meadows swept the trees off to the sides he pulled over to take a last look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had happened and was done . The place was as fixed as a picture on a postcard , the house and barn like black ships in an ocean of fields , the sky a membrane holding the final light , and there were the blurred kitchen windows , and up behind the buildings the field , the rich twenty-acre field propped open toward the south like a Bible , the crease of the water vein almost exactly in the center of the ten-acre pages . He fished in the valise and got Dub 's bottle , swallowed the cold whiskey . Beautiful pasture , four or five years of his work to bring that field up , none of Mink 's labor , his , draining the boggy place , liming and seeding to clover , plowing under the clover three years running to build up the soil , get the sourness out , then planting alfalfa and keeping it going , look at it , sweet good stuff , nutty , full of nourishment . That 's what made those cows give the butterfat , nothing Mink did , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was why he had wanted to go up above the junipers , even though Billy did n't care about the field and could n't tell good fields from bad , not to do what she thought he wanted , but to look at his pasture from above . " I heard it all , now , " she said . " Looks like any stupid old field to me . " She shook her head . " I do n't know if I can make something out of you or not , Loyal . " The field looked like black-green fur in the dull light . " That 's your last look , " he said , laid Dub 's bottle in the glove compartment and threw the car into first . Out of the corner of his eye he half-marked a white dot up in the field . Too big for a fox , wrong shape for a deer . And no stumps in that field . But he was fourteen miles away from home and half across the bridge , stepping gingerly on the brake to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . The dog . The dog was up in the field right where he 'd told him to sit . Still waiting . Jesus Christ .
