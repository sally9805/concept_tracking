<p> AS they haul freight across the country , truck drivers track their hours in logbooks . But truckers have another name for them : " joke books . " <p> Behind the " jokes " - falsified records - is a decades-old tradition of paying truckers by the mile instead of by the hour . <p> The punch line , critics say , is n't so funny . This compensation system , they argue , creates an incentive for truckers to drive too long or too fast . As a result , critics argue , highway safety is compromised . Fatal accidents , though down significantly over the last decade , occur 42 percent more often with heavy trucks than cars . <p> " There is n't going to be any substantive change in the number of truck accidents until we change how a driver is paid , " says Quentin Lewton , a former truck driver who is leading a crusade against the current system . <p> In 1990 , Mr. Lewton drove for J.B. Hunt and Swift Transportation , a trucking company based in Lowell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drove according to the legal federal limits , he says he would have made only $ 12,000 to $ 15,000 . <p> " This industry enjoys a unique situation of not paying a driver for his work , " Lewton says . " Why would companies want to do anything about it ? It 's a gift . " <p> The trucking industry contends that states should enforce the regulations already on the books rather than change the way drivers are paid . But critics say enforcement alone is n't enough . In the long run , trucking companies too could benefit from paying drivers hourly - in reduced turnover , lower insurance rates , and better-maintained vehicles . <p> The issue relates to long-haul truckers driving rigs that are 10,000 pounds or more , not the local delivery truck . <p> Most truckers are paid by the mile or by the load , receiving a percentage ( usually 20 to 23 percent ) of what the trucking company gets to haul the load . Under this system , truckers are n't paid for the work they do on duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight as well as loading and unloading the truck . <p> Under federal law , truckers can work and drive only a total of 70 hours in eight days or 60 hours in seven days . The law also requires that they log their " on duty not driving " time . But because a trucker earns money only when the wheels are rolling , time consumed in work other than driving erodes weekly earnings . <p> " I 've waited as long as four hours in line to get my paperwork back after my truck has been unloaded , " Lewton says , " and it comes out of a driver 's hide . " <p> Those who drive according to the rules , truckers say , risk getting fired , waiting days or weeks for another load , or getting fewer loads in the future . <p> " Everybody drives illegally , because if you drove legally , you would not make enough money to survive , " says Dean Beggs of Auburn , Maine , who has been driving heavy trucks since 1984 . <p> While fines for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get tougher . Last month , Gunther Leasing Transport Inc. , in Hanover , Md. , became the first trucking firm in the nation to be convicted criminally for altering log books . <p> The American Trucking Associations ( ATA ) based in Alexandria , Va. , which represents trucking companies and has 34,000 members , says the current pay system creates an incentive to be more productive . <p> But Mr. Lewton and others disagree . In his grass-roots effort to get truckers paid by the hour , Lewton has been working for San Francisco-based Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways ( CRASH ) . The group wants to see truckers included in the Fair Labor Standards Act . <p> The 1938 law , which regulates most workers ' wages and hours of work in the United States , does not cover truck drivers . Truckers were left out of the law because of a dispute over who had jurisdiction over the industry . <p> Some truckers are paid hourly . Unionized truck drivers , who represent less than 10 percent of the 7.3 million truckers , are paid by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonunion workers . But industry analysts say that 's because most are not long-haul drivers , who put in more miles on the road . <p> " Nothing is consistent in trucking , " says Mr. Beggs , who has worked for at least six trucking companies . " You could deliver at 7 in the morning and you could have a load to pick up at 9 in the morning . Or you could sit there all day long , " waiting for a call from the dispatcher . And during that time , drivers are n't getting paid . Often they are n't getting sleep either because they have to call their dispatcher every half hour . <p> " The public says we drive too fast , " Beggs says . " Yeah , we do . We 're out to make a living . " <p> The ATA denies that truckers are driving over the legal limits . " Most of the drivers we know are driving within the speed limit and are driving within the legal hours of operation and no more , " says James Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denies any correlation between pay and accidents . " There is no documented connection between the way in which drivers are paid and the accident rate , " Mr. Lewis says . <p> But a 1989 study of long-haul truckers driving from Washington State to Minnesota by the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety found that 58 percent violated hours-of-service rules . <p> As for the issue of fatigue , highway groups say it is difficult to measure . A 1994 study by the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) estimates that driver fatigue is a factor in 30 to 40 percent of all heavy-truck accidents . <p> Both the ATA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) say the NTSB survey is not based on a true random sample . The NHTSA contends that fatigue plays a part in only 3 to 4 percent of all car-truck accidents . <p> Changing the pay system , Lewis asserts , " probably ... will not have much of an effect on fatigue . " <p> The fatal-accident rate involving heavy trucks has declined from five accidents per 100 vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NHTSA . Reasons include less drunk driving and improvements in highways and vehicles . Still , the rate remains much higher for trucks than for cars . <p> Industry watchers say a period of intense competition started when the trucking industry was deregulated in 1980 . The shift allowed new firms to enter markets of their choice and eliminated government-set rates . Shippers and receivers gained control of scheduling . <p> Today , many truckers complain that schedules are too tight . " Dispatchers have a 100-mile-an-hour pencil for a 60 mile-an-hour truck , " Lewton says . <p> Truckers say compensation is the key to reducing truck-related accidents . " If you want drivers to stop running over their log books or driving illegally , pay them more money , " Beggs says . <p> He now works for a local firm in Maine hauling heavy equipment . Though it 's a nonunion job , he 's paid hourly . He works nine to 10 hours a day , five days a week , and is home every night . He says he makes the same amount as he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week at a time being paid per mile . <p> Parents Against Tired Truckers ( PATT ) in Lisbon Falls , Maine , which was started in 1994 to help families of people killed in car-truck accidents , at first was against truckers . " At the time , the worst thing on this earth , was a truck driver , " says Russell Swift of PATT , whose son was killed in a car-truck accident in 1993 . But now Mr. Swift sees things differently : " If we continue to put the truck driver in a position where he or she has to make a decision to take a chance or not to support his family , that 's immoral and unfair .
