1 PERSUASION and SENSE AND SENSIBILITY The first of these Jane Austen adaptations is reserved , the second more bustling . But both have heroines ( played impeccably by Amanda Root and Emma Thompson ) who tend to others ' emotional needs while submerging their own , yet find a romantic reward . The enchanted viewer is rewarded too : by subtle ensemble acting , writing that understands the void that tactful conversation fills , direction ( by Roger Michell and Ang Lee , respectively ) that finds the hidden hungers of the cautious soul . Honorable mention to Clueless , the Emma of Beverly Hills High . <P> 2 CRUMB Robert Crumb , the Brueghel of underground comic books , sits uneasily for Terry Zwigoff 's blistering documentary portrait . Crumb 's images of geeky guys and rampaging women seem almost normal next to this picture of his middle-class family  --  a mother and three gifted , twisted sons  --  all devoured by demons . Appalling and enthralling , Crumb is the ultimate situation tragedy . <P> 3 WILD REEDS Young love rarely seemed so tormented or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Political rivalries cloud a bucolic French town and Algerian war drums beat , but the main convulsions are romantic . A great date movie for teens with high sat scores and overheated hearts . <P> 4 LES MISERABLES Writer-director Claude Lelouch 's film is less an adaptation of Victor Hugo 's epic narrative than a passionate response to it  --  one overflowing heart heeding the call of another across the years . Resetting the tale mainly in the occupied France of World War II and reimagining many of its incidents , Lelouch remains true to his source 's sweep , scale and romantic , entirely unfashionable belief in the conquering power of simple human goodness . <P> 5 APOLLO 13 Director Ron Howard and protean star Tom Hanks celebrate the virtues of community  --  ingenuity , patience , humor  --  with such fidelity and drama that the ill-fated 1970 moon shot becomes a triumph for Hollywood on its best behavior . <P> 6 DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS The free-lance private eye 's lot was never a happy one  --  ask Philip Marlowe . But he did n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Denzel Washington ) , a black man , does . And it grants Carl Franklin 's cool , crisp adaptation of Walter Mosley 's novel ( set in classic noirland , ' 40s L.A. ) the edge , weight and revitalizing relevance long needed by a genre often made limply nostalgic . <P> 7 HEAT Who will be prince of this soulless city  --  Robert De Niro 's fastidious criminal or Al Pacino 's emotionally erratic cop ? In the end it does n't much matter . Their job is to lend familiar dramatic tonalities to Michael Mann 's brilliant , jarring , amoral expansion of and meditation on the violent themes running through postmodernist life . <P> 8 TOY STORY Two generations of kids ' playthings  --  a cloth cowboy and a rocket man  --  reach detente in this marvelously inventive buddy film . Yes , the whole thing was animated by computer , but that 's not the big news . It 's that director John Lasseter is the year 's most impressive new comedy visionary . <P> 9 GET SHORTY A movie-mad mobster ( dreamy , incisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a real shark chewing up Hollywood 's rubbery simulacrums while helping some bottom feeders rise to the top in Barry Sonnenfeld 's jaunty , well-acted comedy of bad manners .
