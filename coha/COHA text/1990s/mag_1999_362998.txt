Last week 's news should have set press watchdogs yipping and gnashing . American Media , the company that already owns the National Enquirer and the Star , the two top-selling supermarket tabloids in the U.S. , announced that it would pay $105 million to buy the Globe , the third biggest . The deal would also give American Media ownership of other Globe titles , including the Sun and the National Examiner , putting nearly all of America 's tabloid gossip under one corporate umbrella . This raises big journalistic issues : Are the heady days when the tabs fought for JonBenet Ramsey and Prince William exclusives about to end in polite cooperation ? Will tabloid journalism ever be guilty fun again ? <P> David Pecker , the former chief of Hachette Filipacchi ( Elle , George ) who became president and CEO of American Media in May , vows that the Globe acquisition will actually lead to a greater diversity among the big three tabloids . After he and his partners , including ex-Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman , bought American Media for $850 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had been losing circulation for five years . ( The Enquirer , the Star and their wacky sibling , Weekly World News , sell a combined 4.4 million copies weekly , down 35% since 1994 . ) One reason , he contends , is that " the Enquirer and the Star were really competing against each other . " <P> Pecker , 48 , a hard-driving executive , began by spending $5 million to redesign the Enquirer and the Star . He set out to soften stories with a harder edge and to reposition the tabloids as rivals , for both readers and advertisers , of mainstream publications like People ( which , like Time , is published by Time Inc . ) . Casual headline scanners in grocery check-out lines may not have noticed the difference yet , but Pecker claims it exists . " If there 's a Hollywood scandal , the investigative portion will be done by the National Enquirer . The impact on celebrities , on their careers , that will be done by the Star . " <P> What then are Pecker 's plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most ethically challenged of the big three tabloids ? ( It was the Globe that set up Frank Gifford 's hotel tryst with a former airline attendant , prompting a censorious New York Times op-ed piece by Enquirer editor Steve Coz . ) Pecker says the Globe will " absolutely not " pull such a stunt again . Still , he says , " we 're going to cover the spice and the controversy of the story . It 's going to really be , shall I say , the unvarnished story . " <P> To which the dedicated Globe reader may respond , " Uh-oh . " Pecker seems determined to do to tabloids what Disney did to New York City 's Times Square  --  i.e. , clean things up for family consumption . Since tabloid-type stories now crop up so frequently in mainstream print and on TV , Pecker wants the real tabloids to get more respect  --  and a bigger share of the action . " Right now only 8% of our revenue is advertising , " he says . " I think there 's an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lure upscale advertisers , Pecker has swallowed a weekly loss of $100,000 by banning those blurbs hawking psychic healers , herbal remedies and the like in the Enquirer and the Star .
