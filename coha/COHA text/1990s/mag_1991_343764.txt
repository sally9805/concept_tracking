Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was reminiscing about her father , Jawaharlal Nehru , some years ago . " People say he was like the banyan tree : nothing and nobody grew in his shadow , " she mused . " They are wrong . He was like the sun , and let everything and everybody grow  --  even the weeds , let us be honest . " It was vintage Indira , who would have denied there was a Nehru dynasty even as she came to symbolize it . <P> Leadership has been the Gandhi family 's birthright . In a land accustomed to rajas , maharajas , kings and emperors , a republican ruling family was consistent with India 's long history . It lent legitimacy to the government of a country that until independence in 1947 had been as much a state of mind as a nation-state . <P> No wonder Congress elders turned immediately to Sonia Gandhi , 44 , as party leader . But Sonia is a widow with no desire for power . She never wanted her husband Rajiv to enter politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cradled Indira 's head as she lay dying from assassins ' bullets , and friends note that after the shooting in 1984 , she became obsessed with the safety of her husband and children . Behind the dark glasses she wore during public appearances , her eyes constantly searched crowds for a possible assassin . Says a friend : " What she was most afraid of in the world was losing Rajiv . " <P> Sonia 's aloofness has helped make her a formidable and somewhat unfathomable figure . She assiduously tended Rajiv 's constituency in Amethi , Uttar Pradesh state , but apparently disliked politics . Though a naturalized Indian citizen ! since 1983 , she is Italian by birth , and almost certainly would have faced strong opposition on that ground alone . <P> One of three daughters born to building contractor Stefano Maino and his wife Paola in Lusiana , a small town in Italy 's Veneto region , Sonia was sent to Cambridge in the early ' 60s to study English . There she met Rajiv , who was studying mechanical engineering at Trinity College . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who first gave her blessing and later persuaded Sonia 's parents to consent . The young Italian wholeheartedly adopted India , learning fluent Hindi and Indian cooking . <P> While Sonia refuses to step into the limelight , what about the rest of the family ? The nearest heirs are her two children . Like his father at the same age , Rahul , 20 , a Harvard undergraduate , shows no interest in politics , preferring photography and target shooting . He is the quieter , more introverted of the two children . <P> But her daughter Priyanka , 19 , a student at the College of Jesus and Mary in New Delhi , shows flashes of her grandmother 's fabled toughness and composure . She has displayed a flair for politics , and her strength during her father 's funeral prompted a party worker to say , " Give her time , and she is definitely Prime Minister material . "
