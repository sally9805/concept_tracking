How three defeated dieters finally broke the cycle-and slimmed down for good . // It 's a sinking feeling : You try on a smashing outfit in the departmentstore changing rooms only to discover that you 've jumped tip yet another size . On the drive home , you grimly ponder which weight-loss weapons you should try this time : policing every hite you cat , swilling liquid dinners , hitting the gym five days a cck . If only peeling off the pounds were n't such a misery-and regaining the weight down the road so inevitable . Thankfully , there 's new hope : Experts are finding that previous dieting failures do n't mean you 'll never keep the pounds off . A recent University of Pittsburgh study examined nearly X ( 10 subjects who maintained an average weight loss of 30 pounds for just over five years and concluded that many dieters need several tries to find the strategy that works best for them .

Since a jampacked schedule allowed Jacklyn Ill Marcus , 43 , a Los Angeles mother of two and sculptor , little time for exercise or meal planning , indulging her sweet ax ) th was the only occasion she felt like she was doing something nice for herself . " The problem : " Once I had one cookie , I usually ate the whole box , " confesses Marcus . Depriving herself only made it worse .

Marcus 's first stop on the diet train was a high-protein , no-sweets regimen that took off 40 pounds-for about a year . Dismayed by the regain , she next tried a liquid diet and was disappointed again . The problem was , " I would overeat the moment I allowed myself to go back to real food , " she says . At parties she steered clear of the dessert table , nibbling on fresh veggies and crackers , but " once I got home , I would attack the pantry for anything sweet . " It was bumping into an old friend who also longed to lose weight that started her on the right path-literally . " She suggested we begin jogging together , and wc found wc could use each other to stay motivated , " says Marcus .

" As these morning runs started to pay off , Marcus 's cravings for sugary treats lessened . She began cutting back on bread and pasta ; a typical dinner became grilled fish , steamed vegetables , and a salad . " ' The more healthful foods I ate , the better I felt , and the more energy I had to go jogging , " she says . After dinner , she permitted herself one piece of fruit . " I still have to work hard to enforce this rule because I tend to he a late-night snacker , " she admits " I'o handle parties , which have always spelled diet trouble , Marcus worked out a specific strategy . She modified her hands-off-the-goodies policy , pemitting herself to sample a few high-calorie foods .

But instead of running from temptation , she 's made peace with it by indulging in Saturday-night restaurant dates with her husband that end with a sugary splurge " If I know I 'm going to have a dessert , I 'll order only a salad and soup or an appetizer to compensate for the extra fat and calories , " she explains . Photograph // And she 's discovered another trick that helps prevent her from polishing off the whole dessert plate . " I eat half of the serving very slowly , then go to the bathroom for a few minutes to give my body a chance to feel full from the meal , " she says . " I 've found that what I want is just a taste-not an entire piece of cake ! " With a Little Help from Hubby Flora I Isx ; hent ) erg , 48 , of Norwc ) od , NJ , took pride in being a stay-at-home mom , turning out plenty of cookies and cupcakes for PTA programs as well as serving her kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her home was loaded with dieting booby traps . " I could n't resist eating a large portion of whatever I baked , " she admits Hochenberg had been waging a war against the same 20 pounds for years . Back in 1981 she 'd followed a strict Weight Watchers eating plan in order to dazzle guests ( and her groom ) on her wedding day . Sure enough , she reached her goal in time . " I looked fabulous in my dress , but then the wedding was over , " she says . " I found myself eating more to compensate for the months that I had deprived myself . " Additional pounds crept back on when she ( quit smoking . " The weight gain did n't faze me too much , because I was proud of the fact that I had quit smoking , " Hochenb erg says . iIwo kids later , she was 25 pounds over her wedding-day weight . It was no coincidence that when the bathroom scale broke , the family never got around to replacing it . " I stopped weighing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a license to eat , " she says . That mind-set changed a year and a half ago , when a 45-year-old neighbor died of a heart attack . It was a wake-up call not only for Hochenherg but also for her husband , who had put on his own 25 pounds . " My husband 's father was obese and died of a heart attack in his forties , " she says . And Hochenberg fretted over stories she 'd read about a link between being overweight and developing breast cancer , the disease that killed her mother . The couple decided to get serious about taking off the pounds together , but not by following a draconian diet . Instead , they started working nutritious , low-fat foods into their meals . " We substituted chicken and turkey for red meat and made sure to include at least two servings of vegetables with every meal , " she says . Spaghetti with meatballs made way for pasta primavera ; meaty lasagna layered with high-fat cheeses morphed into spinach lasagna with part-skim ricotta and mozzarella . Some sacrifices were harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fried foods and wine than to give up an cx.xcsional slice of gooey chocolate cake . " I know I lost weight less quickly because I allowed myself to eat some of my favorite foods , " she says . " But I found the process was much easier than it had been in the past " Focusing on the health risks of being overweight-not just vanity-did the trick for her . How did Hochenberg coneluer the home-with-the-treats dilemma ? " Instead of baking for my children 's fundraising sales , now I go to a bakery and get a sealed box of cookies or cupcakes , " she says . And she 's recently started working for a bookstore catalog , bringing in a healthy brown-bag lunch every day . " I keep celery and carrot sticks both at work and around the house for snacks . " The results : Over the course of six months , she lost 25 pounds and has kept them off for more than a year ( her husband has also shed 25 pounds ) . And yes , she did get around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on once a week . " No one could give me the perfect formula for losing weight , " says Hochenberg . " I had to find that out on my own . " An Eating-Style Makeover Being too busy to eat would seem like a surefire way to lose weight , but Barbara Ciment , a 53-year-old mother of two from Silver Spring , MD , actually saw her weight sha ) t up as a booming real-state business kept her on the r ( rad from moming till late at night . The culprit : a steady supply of high-carb snacks stashed in both car and office . " I would eat only one meal a day-dinner with my family , " she says . " The rest of the day I would snack on fat-free crackers , pretzels , and jelly beans . I nibbled all day-sometimes I would n't even notice I was eating . " Carrying extra weight meant never feeling she looked her best in a business where image wins clients . " Shopping for clothes was so depressing , " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose jackets . " One day , while trying on clothes in a department store , she realized that the size-10 ) skirts were too snug - she 'd graduated to a size 12 . At five feet six inches , Climent weighed 164 pounds , an all-time high . It was time to make some changes . She was determined not to repeat her past mistakes . Weight Watchers had n't led to permanent weight loss ; a two-weeklong " cabbage soup diet " also failed . So ( Ciment consulted a nutritionist , who , after analyzing her diet , frowned on her " fat-free " snacks . " She told me I was n't eating enough protein and that I was eating way too much sugar and starch . " ( Ciment was informed that three meals a day would curtail snacking . " I forced myself to eat a howl of shredded wheat with skim milk for breakfast , even though I never feel hungry in the morning , " she says . " I used to think that breakfast was a waste , but I found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would usually begin to nosh . " She also rearranged her schedule to take a 30-minute lunch break at home , grabbing a tuna- or egg-salad sandwich fixed the night before or a cup of low-tat yogurt . One unexpected benefit of the new lunch routine was an energy boost that lasted all afternoon . Still , finding time to prepare healthy meals was no cinch . " I did n't reali&gt;rx how much time it takes to cut up fruits and vegetables to make salads , " she says . " What works for me is making larger portions that last a few days . " Every Sunday she prepares a large howl of coleslawshredded cabbage , carrots , and green peppers mixed with low-fat mayonnaise - for munching throughout the week . Working exercise into her schedule was another problem . Ciment solved it hy not hooking any appointments lx ; fire 9:00 A.M.-that way she can work out for a half hour on the treadmill or stationary bike at least three times a week . Brisk walks on the weekend with her husband help , as do vacations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds , and she 's kept them off for more than a year . " I 'm very happy with where I 'm at , " she says . " Although I lost weight for my appearance , I find I also have a lot more energy now . I was n't expecting this payoff , yet it 's been very rewarding . " <p>
