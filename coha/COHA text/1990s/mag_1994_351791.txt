For those keeping score , the Simpson defense team played pretty good offense last week , while District Attorney Gil Garcetti 's office seemed to be stumbling all over the field . Some of the moves by Simpson 's legal team were largely theatrical : attorney Leroy Taft set up a toll-free number and a $500,000 reward for tips leading to the arrest of the " real killer . " Potentially more damaging , the Los Angeles County coroner 's office , pressured by media leaks , admitted that 16 pieces of evidence in the Simpson case had been mishandled . Though most of the errors were minor ( a container of bile temporarily mislabeled as urine ) , the admission presented an opening for the defense to press its contention that every step of the investigation has been sloppy . And press it did . Shapiro filed a motion charging investigators with failing to pursue witnesses and physical evidence that might buttress Simpson 's claim of innocence . <P> The coroner 's foul-up was particularly painful to some in the D.A . ' s office who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coroner 's investigation . Citing Golden 's reputation for sloppiness , several deputy D.A.s had urged lead prosecutor Marcia Clark to get someone else assigned . " It 'll be O.K. , " Clark responded . She soon learned otherwise . Among the errors that forensic experts see as most serious : the contents of Nicole Simpson 's stomach , which would have been useful in pinpointing the time of her death , were discarded , and her bloody clothes were improperly placed in a communal drip pan that may have contaminated blood samples . <P> But the D.A . ' s office has little time to dwell on such setbacks . It is in the midst of an intraoffice debate over whether to pursue the death penalty for Simpson . If Garcetti 's office opts for death , it risks an acquittal by jurors who do n't want to see Simpson executed . If it rejects a capital trial , Garcetti can expect some people to accuse him of granting Simpson preferential treatment . Though sentiment in the office is currently against seeking the death penalty , there are strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " How do we justify not asking for the death penalty if we really believe that O.J. Simpson premeditated the murder of two people ? On the straight facts alone , if this case does not qualify for the death penalty , I ca n't imagine what case will ever justify it . " <P> More depressing for many seasoned prosecutors is the mounting sense that Simpson has a good chance of walking free . They regard the addition of Johnnie Cochran to the defense team as a major blow . " It 's going to be all these white people up there against O.J. and Cochran , " says a deputy district attorney . " This is a downtown jury and there are going to be a number of black people on it . " Last week a number of senior deputy D.A.s gathered socially , and the talk invariably turned to the Simpson case . An air of resignation immediately overwhelmed the room . " It is not a winnable case , " said an attorney . " My prediction ? Hung jury , bail , retrial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his colleagues listened in gloomy silence  --  and nodded .
