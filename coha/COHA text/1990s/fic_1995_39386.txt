( Portions of text omitted ) <p> One of the best books I never wrote was one to cash in on the millennium . I did get as far as the title : The Two Meets the Three Zeros ( Uptown ) . <p> So delighted with that , I took a year off before purchasing and designating an exercise book to imprison my thoughts on the subject . Ten years on , I flicked through to light upon three terse entries , a squashed ant and an address I had wanted so badly at one point I had completely emptied my study in a frenzy to locate it . Two of the entries were illegible and the third was an attempt at a biography to go on a dust jacket of another book I did n't write . <p> I am working on the assumption that my lifelong sloth has n't been that , but a well-disguised storage of creative vim for the killer opus to leave known civilization gasping . One book and out . I 'm taking it all down . The trivialities . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking no chances . Rounding up all the usual suspects , and all the unusual ones , picking them off as they emerge one by one . <p> The only frank and remotely pleasant exchange I ever had with the Master of my college was very short , after one of my slips . " I 'm flabbergasted , " he perorated , " that you have managed to make a career as a philosopher . " <p> " Not , I assure you , " I replied , " as gobsmacked as I am . " <p> People have said to me : " Eddie you 're a loafer . " People who do n't like me very much and who have assessed my progress uncharitably have said : lush , compulsive gamble , zero , drug-dealer , fraud , disaster , slob . People who like me have said much the same . <p> For the record , I am well aware that I did n't execute any of the chores , that as a pro , as an official thought trafficant <p> should have done . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so much teaching , though this made me rather popular . People were eager to be supervised by me since when they did n't turn up I did n't demonstrate because I was n't there either . <p> I did go to conferences though , if someone else paid . And I was very hot on subscribing to journals . I did the same lecture , year after year , without yielding to the temptation to make changes . <p> I blame the authorities . In a half-reasonable world I would have been fired a long time ago . In a sixth-reasonable world I would have been booted out sooner . Even in a hundredth-reasonable world I would n't have got far . <p> I did everything wrong . I got a first at university . I did n't mean to ( perhaps the secret ) . By the time of my finals I had chosen to go into banking and I knew that without any effort I could pick up enough degree for that . For the last paper , I almost did n't go . It was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies , who had taken much stick in my defence , that I trudged along . Perhaps the first was a subtle , rigged , way of encouraging me to stay on , as Wilber had been persuading me to do . <p> No , I left ( though I did n't get far ) . Nick , who had been on the substitutes ' bench took the slot for zetting young philosopher , but then topped himself . I was expelled from the towers of high finance and parachuted back into Cambridge , months after vowing never to return . <p> I made my speciality the Ionians . Very few people realise that you can read the entire extant oeuvre of the Ionians , slowly and carefully , in an hour . Most of them come in handy packets of adages . Extremely important , the fit caught having a go with their reason , the inventors of paid thought and science  --  anything you 'll find in a university  --  and blissfully cut . <p> Years ago I had noticed some domains in which no one had done any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one has done any work is ( a ) there 's nothing to be done or ( b ) it 's extremely difficult to do something or ( c ) the work 's been done but you did n't know about it because you were too sloppy when you checked the first time . In addition , as a specialist in the history of philosophy , I can assure you that there is n't a thought that the Greeks did n't copyright ; they corralled all the concepts long before Christ . That 's a position you could defend comfortably . And any cranial creations that you might maintain were n't spotted by them have certainly been mopped up by the French , German and British crews . <p> Take my favorite researcher , the brilliant John Smith , ( try checking up on that name ) whose hermit-like existence rapidly achieved legendary status . A legendary hermit-like existence that was necessarily legendary and hermit-like because John Smith did n't exist . <p> People have read and , allegedly , enjoyed his work . They 've seen his documentation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and praised by the cleaners for its tidiness ) . People had distinct memories of him . They discussed the meetings he did n't attend , lunches he mysteriously cancelled at the last minute via bizarre forms of indirect communication . And even if he was , in essence , a figment pigmented by my wit , where did it say on the application form you had to be able to make a bed creak ? <p> And there were naturally bona fide zettists too ( eletromagnetically discernible to others ) who got the peel of the financial fruits . There will be those who will say I was blocking those with talent from furthering the cause of the biz . Good , I 'm glad , as the politicians say , that you mentioned that . That 's exactly what I was doing . Three years at university doing philosophy is enough for any healthy individual . <p> It occurs to me that with the demands that are made on our leisure time , a wallet-sized , handbag-fitting Top Ten Philosophical Hits might be a profitable venture . I scrawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prosifications 1-15 omitted ) <p> So there 's the squad I have to whittle down . It 's interesting that Seneca charts so often . Zero as a thinker , a failure on the new grey juice front , one has to own up that as a commentator and ideal salesman , he 's unbeatable . <p> 1 . This is arguably the top sentence in the biz . The maximum maxim . " This is what Zeno said , but what about you ? " You might have some trouble deciding which Zeno Seneca was referring to , but this question unquestionably captures the gist ; it 's not the enlightenment that counts , but the taking part . The great heavyweights of antiquity are not there to be admired but to be lifted , to be tested against your brain 's brawn . The prosifications of the greats are no more use than dumbells under the bed if you do n't pump them . <p> 4 . Stupidly , that 's me : Hamann doing his Socrates number ( as well as issuing a reminder that no amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're lucky enough to be portering a massive arrogance , a quotidian sensation , one neatly glorified by St. Augustine in ( 13 ) ( If I 'm in bed with a hippopotamus , I am ) , then covered more successfully by Rene , producing one of the greatest one-liners . You 've got to get the monostich right . Posterity wo n't bear anything that ca n't be fitted on a beer mat . You need the catchphrase . For the T-shirts . <p> 12 . Live according to nature . This is an evergreen one . You get this everywhere : the problem is making up your mind what nature is . Get someone to tell you and give them your money . Great all-purpose line massive with con men and fakes of all nations . Also this Senecaism encapsulates the old style phil which promises to make a real man of you , to deagonize your life , to give you a tonic , as opposed to Ludwig 's light for hire and what you see is what you get clarification . <p> 11 . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good one to stick in to avoid lapidation , burning at the stake , being machine-gunned and so on , unless you 're living in a society where the clerics have gone in for social work . This should be squired by : " audacter deum roga "  --  Seneca . Call boldly on God , a move hardly limited to practitioners of the biz , the only recourse most of us have . The striking thing about the biz is that despite the wielding of rationality , the brouhaha over proof , the bravado of the nous , you ca n't turn the history of philosophy without tripping over mysticism , spectre-spectaculars and bleatings for celestial authorities to sort out our riddle-riddled universe . <p> 6 . Themistocles zooming around the agora in a tart-powered chariot . Nothing to do with philosophy of course . But what an idea ! <p> I rerererererereturned(10) to Cambridge from London one Monday to find a letter enclosing a contract for me to write a history of thought . Perplexed , I surmised I had impressed someone at a party . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties . Money , a zam-zum-mim of an advance for a signature ? That seemed a good deal , a bonus for being rat-arsed . However , it soon transpired that more was required from my pen than my mark but a quick tour of philosophical bloodshed through the ages ? A doodle . <p> The advance for the book was unnaturally large and caused pleasing amounts of resentment amongst my colleagues , with Featherstone in the lead . I bought a case of Chateau Lafite ' 61 and put it down for two days ( the irony is that I do n't even like Chateau Lafite , I 'm not sure anyone does ) . I consumed it in one sitting and lying on the floor . I pissed the money away mostly through my best suit . I was a middle-aged home for the world 's griefs , homing in on me . <p> Why do you drink ? I have been asked . Because ( a ) I like to and ( b ) it 's hard to stop . When you 've got the hole , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of pounds of meaning , a packet of panacea , a can of resolution . A solution for one 's plight is hard to find , but solutions are n't . You ca n't go a hundred yards without a pick-up point for zymurgic solutions : off-licences , pubs , supermarkets , restaurants . Civilization is a careful construction for the production and distribution of alcohol . <p> The publishers eventually tracked me down and asked me about the book , how it was , where it could be found ? I countered by asking for mote money , simply so I had something to say apart from , I ca n't find the typewriter and even if I could find it , it does n't have a ribbon , and the a and the z do n't work . <p> I do n't know whether I have unwittingly the knack to sound charming , or whether I had latched onto a singularly profligate publisher , but more money was sent . <p> I bought ten crates of tequila , true brainwash , which would have cleansed the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't volunteered to spend the weekend with me at a cottage near South Zeal . It 's not a fact that has been widely marketed , but that weekend we created , over three hundred square feet , for several hours , intergalactic euphoric eternal fraternal just benevolence . <p> The thing about signing a contract is that it can mislead people into thinking something has been agreed . In reply to their missives , I snarled for more money , more rudely . I trusted that they would get tired of me , but no , the cheques came unabated . <p> To an extent , I did bring it on myself . I did weaken and send in an outline ( knocked out for me by a most junior research fellow ) . They responded by sending me their catalogue , announcing my forthcoming title . The arrival of the catalogue became an annual event . There is a part of me that likes to make people happy so when they asked if the book would be ready I said yes , granting them an epoch of contentment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ females , some bursting into tears , some threatening me with that hushed , knotted hatred that proceeds fevered stabbing with a good quality kitchen knife . My guilt was such that after four years I went to the university library and copied out a few pages of a nineteenth-century work on medieval thought by a Reverend , updating a number of the verbs . <p> Then one day I got a call from a Scottish voice introducing herself as my new caseworker . " Why do n't we have a drink ? " A woman who knows how to handle crabby philosophers , I thought . <p> Hence I arrived at the offices to be the target of those regards that only someone who is seven years late with delivery of book and who has been the beneficiary of small , but accumulatively obscene and ruinous advances gets . My arrival at the publishers and holding a glass of zinfandel was my last usuable memory for some time . I misplaced quite a bit of time mnemonically . I have a hazy thought on why planes have to be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discomfort and disorientation . <p> Of cold and discomfort , more reports were submitted by my body and as my consciousness gave them serious consideration , my senses gave me an image of myself handcuffed to a radiator in a bare , white-walled cottagey building . The handcuffs seemed an official philosopher-restraining device , so I assumed I was in some backward , had-up clink . I wondered how the nearest British Consulate would react to me . <p> Then the young lady who was my current editor walked in . Certainly , in an attaching- a-philosopher-to- a-radiator situation , the handcuffs win ; they are the supreme rhetorical device for attaining juxtaposition . If you must do this , I do endorse an attractive young woman as a kidnapperess , though preferably one that does n't want you to write a book . <p> So , I was bereft of booze , captured in a cottage , devoid of hyperspace liquid that could gain me access to ticketless travel . <p> " Dr. Coffin , you are lazy ... thoughtless ... crapulent ... contemptible . " I was biding my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but nothing surfaced in her disdain that I could really contest . " You 're on Barra . You 're miles from the nearest off-licence , even if you could decuff yourself . You have a problem : me . And I have a problem : you . We can unproblem ourselves . I enjoy working in publishing , but you are impeding , indeed threatening my career . No one has ever been so reluctant to blacken paper as you , no one has ever been so absorbent of funds . Now I have the task of getting a book out of you . I did n't ask for it , but my job depends on it . I 've tried being friendly , I 've tried being stern , I 've tried leaving you alone , I 've tried pestering you ... " <p> " I can remember the being left alone , but I ca n't place the pestering or ... " <p> " Your memory is extremely selective . " <p> " All memory is extremely selective , " I said attempting a wriggle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what memory 's there for , to not remember , otherwise we 'd be weighed down with telephone numbers , tooth brushings , zouk , nose-blowings , ceilings , furniture , shopping , waiting for public transport , our work ... " I petered out , being poorly and unable to mount a rhetorical blitz from the floor . <p> " At the risk of wearying your memory , let me reiterate the salient facts . You 've had seven years and the largest advance we 've ever given . We 've had thirty badly typed , treble-spaced pages , which do n't make much sense . " <p> " Let 's hire someone to hunt down some nice illustrations ... to fatten it up a bit . " <p> " Dr. Coffin , we , but particularly I , need a book . Books start at four times the length you 've submitted . " <p> " We could be different . " <p> " No , we can sit down and write . Ten pages a meal . When you 've done two hundred you can say goodbye to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are n't many I do n't have ) but in many ways I 'm reasonable and unflappable . With good humour I had been conducting a colloquy from a cold floor , abducted and manacled to a radiator . Perhaps my personality had n't been switched on ; but suddenly my ego bounded out of its kennel and barked . I went berserk and had a good zob . <p> Do you know who I am ? <p> This is I risky ploy . Akin to parachuting , you 've got to be sure it 's going to work , otherwise all you 're doing is outrageously multiplying your discomfort . It was the only time I made a claim to importance ; my play for dignity only resulted in pure indignity . <p> Still , if you 're going to lose all dignity , look utterly ridiculous and be stripped of all cultivated attributes and blub pathetically , there are a few places better than a cottage in Barra with an audience of one to get it out of the way . <p> I frothed for four minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did enough sulking for a small town in five minutes . However , being a pro , I could n't delude myself about the rapidly approaching craving for a drink . I had a go at negotiation . It did n't work . <p> " I have n't kidnapped you , Dr. Coffin . No one could believe that a slip of a lass like me could force a beachmaster of erudition such as yourself , a man with a history of violence , to do anything . There are plenty of witnesses to your travelling up here zealously , bottle of malt in hand . I ca n't make you write , but I warn you I 'm on holiday for two weeks and that 's a long time for a man in your position . " <p> I weighed things up : fuming and refusing and enduring , or capitulating and scribbling ? Perhaps this was the induced birth of a mighty opus . <p> " Forget the food , " I said in heroic stoic , " get me a drink . " <p> We had a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a volume of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary ( Marl-Z ) as a desk , tried to write , the bottle of whiskey opposite me across the room , onerous when you feel as if you are under thirty feet of water . <p> Using big words and big letters and a deal of repetition , I had reached the furthest reach of page ten when she reentered . <p> " That 's the Renaissance , " I said , sullenly indicating the papers , " bottle please . " <p> While I badgered , she scrutinized the sheets . " I ca n't read this , " she pronounced , " I ca n't read a word of this , apart from one that looks like geranium and that ca n't be right . " I reminded her , whilst thrashing about on the floor and worming down to new depths of abasement , that she had n't asked for ten legible pages . She fetched a typewriter and a low table . <p> I threw another zam-zum-mim of a tantrum because typing out the pages was n't appealing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized I could n't read my own writing either . I sprinted across the pages , because whatever you do , the desire for a drink remains patiently . <p> " Do you do this for a living ? Am I mistaken in thinking that you are a specialist in the history of philosophy ? " <p> By then the residue of dignity had gone , and I simply slumped on myself in the way you see people do in disaster areas when they know that they will never enjoy themselves again . Darkness came and I was given a bowl of porridge and a banana . I smouldered through the night like a harshly-treated primate , having come to terms with perishing on Barra . But the next morning when she turned up with some toast , she handed me a chapter . <p> " What do you think ? " <p> " It 's very lucid , " I commented . <p> " Fine , " she said unlocking " I can not agree to such subterfuge , unless you give me a cast-iron guarantee that I will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
