Three hard men fight to survive in the wild // Our wealthy friend Fenton Quagmire picked up Retch Sweeney and me for a little outing up in the Cabinet Mountains . We were disappointed to learn that we had to rough it . " How come you did n't bring the nice motor home instead of this old clunker , Quagmire ? " Retch asked . " Think the new one was too good for your low-class friends ? " " Low class ? " Quagmire said . " Who promoted you guys ? " " Hey , Quagmire , " I said ; " it 's not that we have anYthing against your $200,000 rig here . It 's perfectly fine for roughing it in the mountains . We certainly can get by on the bare necessities-the standard-size TV , the microwave , the airconditioning and the like . It 's just , you know , we get used to the first-class treatment when we go camping with you . " " You 're right , " Quagmire said . " Actually , I 'm a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's already three years old . But I had to put the new rig in the shop . The humidity control seemed to be acting up . Just lucky I held on to this old thing . " " You did right , " I said . " Think what might have happened if we 'd been way off somewhere in the mountains and the humidity control conked out . " " Gives me the shakes just thinking about it , " Retch said . I picked up a caviar canape off the tray on the coffee table . Retch slipped the video of The Magnificent Seven into the cassette player and stretched out on the couch . I thought about popping a bag of popcorn into the microwave , but decided to wait . You never know what kind of delicacies Quagmire might have in the freezer , so it 's not a good idea to take the edge off your appetite too soon . I spun the captain 's chair around a couple of times , making myself either slightly dizzy or reflective . " Either of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and actually go out ? " " What ? " Retch.said . " You mean go outside ? " " Like out in the elements ? " Quagmire said . " I bet you guys do n't even remember campfires ? " I said . " In the evening we 'd sit around the campfire and poke at it with sticks . " " Why would we do that ? " Quagmire asked . " Poke at the fire with sticks ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " We just did it . That 's what you did in the evening with a campfire . " " Did n't the smoke get in the way of us watching TV ? " Retch asked . " No , " I said . " Because there was n't any TV . There would just be us and our sleeping bags and maybe a tent . " " And mosquitoes and deerflies , " Retch said , popping a grape into his mouth . " I do seem to remember mosquitoes and deerflies . " " Wind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month we spent in a storm on the side of the mountain one night . Thought the tent was going to turn into a hang glider ! Boy , that was fun , was n't it ? " " No , " I said . " Remember , Quagmire , how you got all ticked off and bit me on the ankle just because I stepped on your glasses in the dark ? " " I was wearing them , you idiot ! " We were starting to wind up a narrow mountain road with numerous switchbacks and large rocks scattered about . I was glad Quagmire was driving . And that it was his rig . This was about the last place I 'd want to meet a loaded log- ging truck and have to back up a motor home around all these switchbacks . " Say what you want about actually going out when you go out , but I like this , " Retch said , rubbing the soft nap on the upholstery as if it were his blanky . Suddenly , he pointed out a window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there ? " " Mount Horrible , " I said . " I thought Mount Horrible was down in the Blues . Ai n't that where we nearly froze to death ? " " Which time we nearly froze to death ? Be more specific . " " Well , let 's see . Oh yeah , it was the time we ran out of water and had to drink out of mud puddles in that old skid trail . I can still remember sifting out the pebbles with my teeth . " " That was Mount Misery . " " You 're right . That 's when we hiked out through Starvation Flats . " " And you broke through the ice crossing Deadman 's Creek ! Funny ! " " Hey , will you guys please stop it ? " Quagmire pleaded . " Mount Horrible , Mount Misery , Starvation Flats , Deadman 's Creek ! You 're starting to depress me . Where do these dreadful names come from , anyway ? " " Well , " I said , " they 're certainly P.M. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's them old-time campers what done it , " Retch said . " Come up with these names . Life was tough back then . There was no pussyfootin ' around when it came to naming stuff . " " You ever get the feeling , " said Quagmire , " that old-time campers were n't a bundle of laughs ? " " Yeah , " I said , swiveling around in my captain 's chair to nip another canape off the coffee table . " But it 's not as if we do n't have our own hardships . Just suppose you had brought your nice rig , Quagmire , and the humidity control had gone out on us . " " Makes me shudder , " said Retch . " But I guess that 's why we come on these adventures , just to expose ourselves to such risks . " " Sure , " I said . " We really do expose ourselves to risks and hardships out here in the wilds . I think we should start renaming the local geographic features to reflect our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm all for it , " said Quagmire . " You go first , Pat . Give us a new name for Mount Misery . " " All right , let 's see now . Hmmm . Okay , how about In Denial Peak ? " " Perfect ! " exclaimed Quagmire . " Your turn , Retch . A new name for Mount Horrible . " " This is hard . Um , how about , uh , Mount Hangover ? " " Not bad , " I said . " Your turn , Quagmire . " " Dejection Flats ! " Then we all began to rattle off names as fast as we could : " Attention Deficit Disorder Hill . " . " Codependency Gulch ! " " Irritable Colon Creek ! " " Forgot-the-Salt Camp ! " " Pattern Baldness Mountain ! " " Heat Rash Ridge . " " Ingrown Toenail Trail . " " Stop ! " I cried at last . " I ca n't stand it ! I 'm sorry I ever came up with the idea ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 109 " Sprained Ankle Pass ! " cried Retch . " Stop it ! " I shouted again . " Let 's just face it . We 're not in the same league as old-time campers when it comes to danger and hardship . " " Logging truck curve ! " Retch shouted . " Did n't you hear me tell you to stop ... LOGGING TRUCK COMING ROUND THE CURVE ! " Quagmire swallowed a caviar canape whole , stood on the brakes , threw the motor home into reverse and sent it roaring and screeching backward down and around three switchbacks before he skidded into a turnout . A long silence marred only by heavy breathing followed the passing of the logging truck . Retch at last spoke . " New name for road : Change Your ... " " Forget it , " I said . " We 're just going to let the old names stand . They tell you something about life back in the olden days . You take Mount Misery . A hunting party was stranded up there in a blizzard and ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's some real misery for you guys . We knocked out the oil pan on the motor home . You two have to walk back to town and get a wrecker . " " Do n't try to kid us , Quagmire , " I said . " Just use your cell phone . " " Tried it . Does n't work down in this canyon . Ditto the CB . So you guys are walking ! " " Try and make us , Quagmire ! " Fortunately , the moon came up shortly after darkness fell , and Retch and I had no trouble walking down the road . " I do n't mind roughing it , " Retch said . " But this is ridiculous-walking ! Outdoors ! You would n't think Quagmire would be so mean as to threaten not to let us camp in his new motor home anymore , would you ? " " No , " I said . " But that 's the problem with some of these rich guys . They can be ruthless when they want to . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old IFUT out of my garage and go camping with it . " " I forget , " I said , " what 's an IFUT ? " " The old Interior-Frame Umbrella Tent . You know , where you held up the frame by resting the little pipe on the top of your head and it cut little donut shapes out of your scalp while you were erecting the tent . And we could sleep right on the hard , cold ground , just like in the old days , and burn our food over a campfire . It would be fun , would n't it ? " , " No . " " You 're right . Hey , maybe we should take Quagmire back a couple of really nice cigars , just to let him know we were only kidding about roughing it with him . Sure , we suffered , suffered a lot , but , hey , that 's what camping 's all about , right ? " " Yep . " <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
