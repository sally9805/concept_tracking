<p> For three generations , the fortunes of the Brancaleone family of Gloucester , Mass. , depended on the rich cod , haddock and flounder fisheries of Georges Bank off the coast of New England . <p> Now , the future of the New England groundfish industry could depend on Joseph Brancaleone , who is struggling to revive a resource whose decline forced him from the path established by his Sicilian grandfather . <p> As head of the New England Fishery Management Council 's groundfish committee , Brancaleone , 42 , is leading a desperate attempt to restore stocks of the species that feed primarily on the sea bottom and that have been depleted to historically low levels . And he is seeking to make good on the dashed promise of 1976 legislation establishing an exclusive U.S. fishing zone extending to 200 miles offshore . <p> In the process , Brancaleone will likely force some of the men he used to fish alongside to give up their traditional way of life . <p> That landmark law , designed to manage and conserve U.S. fisheries , succeeded in halting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But under the light hand of previous management councils that serve as advisers to the Commerce Department 's National Marine Fisheries Service , the law also encouraged explosive growth of the U.S. fleet and the plundering by Americans of one of the world 's great protein factories . <p> Under terms of a consent decree in a lawsuit by the Conservation Law Foundation and the Massachusetts Audubon Society against the National Marine Fisheries Service , the council is now scrambling to produce by March 1 a draft plan for ending overfishing of cod and yellowtail flounder within five years and of haddock within 10 years . <p> To save New England fishermen from themselves , the council is heading toward adoption of conservation measures that could dramatically change the industry , and put at least some operators out of business . <p> In addition to traditional management tools such as increasing net mesh size and putting some fishing areas off-limits , the council is also likely to impose more draconian restrictions that fly in the face of New England 's traditionally freewheeling fishing business . <p> They include telling individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of fishermen . <p> The likely result ? " Widespread bankruptcies , " predicted the director of a fishermen 's organization based in Rhode Island . <p> During a recent two-day meeting of the groundfish committee in Warwick , Brancaleone 's expression reflected the agony of trying to save the resource and the livelihood of his friends and neighbors . Facing the anger and special pleadings of various fishing groups but hamstrung by the consent decree , Brancaleone tried to nudge the committee toward a consensus . <p> Brancaleone understands in a personal way the crushing economics of a declining resource . Despite his family tradition , the combination of U.S. overfishing in the 1980s and a 1984 agreement with Canada that put a portion of Georges Bank off-limits to the U.S. fleet proved too much . <p> The two Brancaleone family trawlers , which once returned to Gloucester brimming with 60,000 to 80,000 pounds of fish apiece , were lucky to bring in 20,000 pounds after a 13-day trip . Three years ago , Brancaleone sold the boats and took a job as assistant manager of a fast-food restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it has only itself to blame for the wrenching choices it now faces . The council 's performance , critics argue , is only the most glaring illustration of lackluster enforcement of the 1976 Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act . <p> That legislation , passed amid great hopes for the 200-mile fishing limit , created eight regional fishing councils and directed them to draft " conservation and management " plans to " prevent overfishing while achieving , on a continuing basis , the optimum yield from each fishery . " <p> As the Senate neared final passage of the Magnuson act in early 1976 , its chief sponsor , Sen. Warren G. Magnuson ( D-Wash. ) , hailed it as a " conservation bill " that " establishes a national fishery management program to conserve our fishery resources . " <p> Lost in the euphoria over the legislation , however , was a more prescient warning from Sen. Ted Stevens ( R-Alaska ) . " As to those people who believe that the passage of this bill automatically will restore our fisheries , " Stevens said during that final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news for them . " <p> As Stevens predicted , it would take more than federal legislation to nurse the fishing industry back to health . Particularly in New England , but also to a lesser extent in some other regions , the history of the regional councils has been one of sad news . <p> Dominated by fishing interests , as the law requires , some councils have been reluctant to propose strict conservation measures . <p> Secretaries of the Commerce Department , who have ultimate authority over the fishery management plans devised by the councils , have rarely used their power to insist on stronger conservation measures . <p> Nor has Congress , which one conservationist said has been governed by a simple axiom : Fish do n't vote , but fishermen do . <p> " The entire approach of the councils and the commercial fishermen has been to exploit that resource to the maximum extent possible , " said Amos Eno , director of conservation programs for the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation , a private nonprofit group established by Congress . <p> " A major reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a recent assessment of the National Marine Fisheries Service , " is the councils ' tendency to set catch levels that are more attuned to the economic needs of fishermen than to the long-term conservation of the stocks . " <p> " Both the council and the secretary of commerce , " concluded another study , by the Massachusetts Offshore Groundfish Task Force , " have failed to carry out their responsibility under the Magnuson Act to conserve a valuable public resource . " <p> " Ultimately , " said Harry Upton of the Center for Marine Conservation , " you have a council system that does n't listen to science . " <p> After briefly rebounding following passage of the Magnuson Act , the groundfisheries of Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine have steadily declined  --  with sporadic upward fluctuations of some species  --  under relentless pressure from larger fleets equipped with ever more sophisticated fish-finding technology . <p> In 1991 , according to a Commerce Department report on U.S. fisheries , nine of 12 species of bottom feeders were considered overfished in the Northeast , including cod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flounder . Recent annual commercial landings of principal groundfish species in the range of 160,000 metric tons , concluded the study , are less than half of the long-term potential yield if resources were managed wisely . <p> The Georges Bank haddock catch , for example , has declined from about 28,000 metric tons in 1980 to about 5,400 metric tons in 1990 . <p> In its latest status report on fish stocks , the National Marine Fisheries Service predicts that haddock numbers will " remain at record or near record low levels " for at least the near future . Said Vaughn C. Anthony , conservation chief for the NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science Center , " This stock is a basket case . " <p> " If we do nothing , " said Rep. Gerry E. Studds ( D-Mass. ) , " we will see the fisheries disappear . . . . The most irresponsible thing we can do is nothing , because then everybody will be out of work . " <p> Steven A. Murawski , chief of the population dynamics branch of the NMFS Fisheries Science Center in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a likelihood " that the yield can rebound under proposals being discussed by the council that are designed to reduce fishing mortality by 50 percent . <p> But he said they are likely to face fierce opposition because they run counter to " a basic philosophy in New England that stems from hundreds of years of fishing these resources : ' Government stay out . This is the last bastion of free enterprise . ' " <p> Fishermen , individually and through the associations that have sprung up in response to the council 's recent deliberations , are deeply skeptical of the government 's ability to manage the resource . Not only has government failed to stop widespread cheating that has made a mockery of earlier rules , they say , but the council is headed toward an inflexible bureaucratic system without adequately consulting those who fish every day . <p> " They are trying to manage a resource that 's unmanageable , " said Rodney Avila , 48 , a fourth-generation New Bedford fisherman . " Nobody has faith in their numbers . " <p> Accusing the council of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desire to take control of every aspect of the business , " East Coast Fisheries Foundation head James D. O'Malley predicted that there will be " widespread bankruptcies " if the conservation measures now under discussion are imposed . <p> " The basic problem is one of government intrusion into small business with rules and regulations made by people who do n't have a sufficient grasp of either the industry or the environment to make correct decisions , " said O'Malley , whose group represents commercial fishermen . <p> To Brancaleone , such criticisms ignore what he calls a " damned if you do , damned if you do n't " reality . If the council fails to enact measures to save the fishery , he says , the court agreement will simply hand the job to the National Marine Fisheries Service . <p> " I have a real love for this business , " Brancaleone said . " Now , in this position , having to face my friends , it 's difficult . I hear people saying , ' You 're going to ruin my way of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something , we will ruin a way of life .
