To keep your gear alive and well , make sure it 's squeaky clean and properly stored . BY KRISTIN HOSTTER // It had been a long , wet trip . Good to be home , I thought , as I dumped my sodden pack in a corner of the garage and made a beeline for the shower . It was n't until two weeks later , when I went looking for some windshield wiper fluid , that I remembered my gear . I quickly dumped my pack 's contents on the lawn , but it was too late . In an invisible cloud of mildew stench , I sat in the grass and picked through the mess . Lesson learned : Leave wet , dirty gear and clothing trapped inside your pack for more than a few days , and you 're courting disaster in the form of mold , weakened fabrics , damaged coatings , and perpetual stink . That 's why proper cleaning and storage is a must . We all know the importance of using a pretrip checklist while packing , but the post-trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour after each trip and go through the following steps so your gear and technical apparel will last longer , perform better , and be ready for the next outing . Tent : Whether your tent is soaked or just a little damp , it 's critical to get it out of that confining little stuff sack , and pronto ! Mildew can lead to damaged fabric , peeled coatings , and a stubborn stink that will forever remind you that you screwed up . It 's best if you can set up the tent in your yard on a sunny day to let it air dry . Never put it in the dryer because you 'll destroy the coatings . If it 's raining when you get home , throw it over a line in the basement or bathroom , then carry it outside when skies clear . Once dry , give it a sponge bath with a diluted solution of cold water and a mild soap . Air dry again , then stuff in a cotton pillowcase for long-term storage . Sleeping bag : Leave your bag in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hence , its ability to keep you warm . As soon as you get home , give your bag a good shake to fluff it up , then let it relax , either laid out on the grass or hung on a line in the fresh air for an afternoon or so . If you must wash the bag , carefully follow instructions on the label . Limit washings as much as you can , since they stress the insulation and fabric . When it 's fluffy and dry , put the bag in a large breathable mesh or cotton storage sack ; a king-size pillow case works fine . Self-inflating sleeping pads : Believe it or not , foam has memory . If you leave it rolled up tight for long periods of time , it wo n't remember to puff up when you open the valve . On the other hand , if its regular state of rest is inflated , it 'll blow itself right up when you unfurl it in camp . When you get home , let your pad inflate , then store it under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valve open . If it 's dirty , sponge it off , and let it air dry before storing . // The lowdown on getting rid of dirt // Boots : Mildew loves leather , so it 's important to dry your boots immediately after any trip . Do n't set them too close to a heat source , though , or you 'll shrink the leather . Remove the insoles and laces , and set them in a cool , dry place . If they 're really soaked , stuff them with newspapers to absorb the water . Once dry , clean them with a stiff brush , then treat them with your favorite boot goop to replenish the leather 's natural moisture . If you do n't plan on using them for a while , it does n't hurt to stick a pair of shoe trees inside to protect their shape . Knives : After cleaning and drying your knife , wrap it in a soft cotton cloth . The leather or fabric sheaths that many knives come in absorb moisture , which can result in rusty blades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a good shake to remove food remnants and loose dirt . If it 's wet , loosen all the compression straps , unzip all the pockets , and let it air dry . When storing your pack , make sure it 's got some breathing room so the hipbelt and shoulder strap padding does n't buckle and wrinkle . Hanging it on a peg by the grab loop works well . Clothing : After a long stinky trip , you 'll probably want to wash most of your clothing before you put it away . Just remember that the washing process is stressful on any fabric , so if you want your apparel to perform at its best and last a lifetime , do n't cram it into the washing machine or ship it off to the dry cleaners . Detergents and harsh dry-cleaning chemicals can harm your garments ' performance coatings . It 's best for both your gear and the environment to use chemical-free , homemade cleaning concoctions whenever possible . Here are some natural , inexpensive , and safe alternatives . You probably have most of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part white vinegar , 1 part liquid castile soap ( like Dr. Bronner 's ) , 1 part water . Instead of bleach : S cup white vinegar , baking soda , or Borax . Just add to the washing machine with your regular soap . Instead of disinfectant : 1/2cup Borax , 1 gallon boiling water . Instead of chemical stain remover : 1 tablespoon liquid castile soap , 1 tablespoon glycerin ( available from drug or natural food stores ) , and 1 cup water . Before cleaning , read the hangtag on your garment and defer to the manufacturer 's recommendations , since the maker knows the fabric better than anyone . But if the hangtag says " dry clean only , " be suspicious because the process uses potentially harmful chemicals . Call the manufacturer to ask why they recommend dry cleaning . In many cases they 'll tell you hand or machine washing is fine , and will probably give you specific tips .

Find the time to follow these steps and your payback will be longerlasting , better-performing gear . 1 . Fill a bathtub with lukewarm ( not hot ) water , then dissolve a small amount of cleaner ( castile , glycerin , or one of the specialized cleaners described above ) . 2 . Immerse the grungy garment and knead gently . Do n't twist or wring ! 3 . Allow to soak for about 30 minutes , more or less . 4 . Drain the tub , then press the water out of the garment . 5 . Refill the tub with warm water , let the garment soak for another 15 minutes , then knead to remove soap . Drain the tub and compress the garment again . 6 . Rinse and press at least one more time ; several times is ideal . 7 . Lift the garment gently , then lay it flat on a towel or screen . 8 . Air dry for a couple of hours before machine drying .

That 's an old wives ' tale that 'll damage down plumules . <p>
