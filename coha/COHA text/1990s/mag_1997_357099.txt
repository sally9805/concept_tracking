He drank too much and smoked too much . He granted too many interviews full of cynical observations about himself and his business . He made too many bad movies and hardly any of the kind that stir critics to rapture or that , taken together , look like a life achievement worthy of official reward . <P> God , some of us are going to miss Robert Mitchum ! <P> He was the kind of guy who would publicly declare in the midst of an endless shoot with revered , meticulous David Lean that it was " like building the Taj Mahal out of toothpicks . " Or sum up his hardworking , half-century career this way : " You do n't get to do better ; you just get to do more . " <P> Yet he was also the kind of man who would crawl through a field of nettles four times during the shooting of Heaven Knows , Mr. Allison , until he had a satisfactory take , keeping the blood from multiple scratches hidden from director John Huston . And the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare chest and let it drip unheeded  --  metaphorical blood this time , from a profoundly wounded psyche  --  as he proceeded to scare the wits out of Polly Bergen . <P> " It sure beats working , " he always said of acting , and these incidents convey the same message : do whatever the job requires , but do n't make a big deal of doing something you 're being overpaid for . This was an attitude many great male stars of Hollywood 's classic age mastered . But Mitchum , achieving prominence late in that period ( with his war- and bone-weary platoon leader in 1945 's The Story of G.I. Joe ) , took self-deprecation to new levels . <P> Like the modern jazzmen who were his contemporaries , he helped define cool for postwar America . He had hoboed across the country as a teenager , got into movies taking anonymous horse falls and survived a setup drug bust ( he described jail as " just like Palm Springs without the riffraff " ) . Stardom , he implied , was just another of life 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the best of his screen characters did . There 's a marvelously stunned stoicism in his confrontation with the inner furies that haunt him in Pursued . And when he turned to outright psychopathy with his child-stalking evangelist in The Night of the Hunter , he made you lean forward to catch all the nuances of his menace . <P> That film 's director , Charles Laughton , thought he was " one of the best actors in the world . " Like Huston , Laughton saw beneath Mitchum 's surpassing cool the heat of an often disappointed perfectionist . In his signature role , the private eye in the classic film noir Out of the Past , Mitchum grimly accepts doom as the price of sexual obsession and lights his passage to it with flaring wisecracks . " I do n't want to die , " his inamorata cries . " Neither do I , baby , " Mitchum snaps . " But if I have to , I 'm gon na die last . " As inadvertent epitaphs go , it 's pretty good . For one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those impious corners of the heart where we treasure our more gallant and stylish transgressors . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
