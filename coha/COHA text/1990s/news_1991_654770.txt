<p> LOS ANGELES had reduced the museum curator from Vienna to tears . <p> We could sympathize with him because it has sometimes done almost the same to us . <p> " I was staying at the Gamble House in Pasadena , " he explained . We knew the Gamble House , that small , well-kept monument to the architecture of the brothers Greene and Greene and to a now long-past era in southern California living . " And I had to drive out to Malibu for a job interview at the Getty Museum . In a car someone had given me to use . " <p> He mused a moment before continuing . The dreadfulness of that day still evoked ambivalent reactions . <p> " First of all , it astonished me that I had to make a parking reservation for a job interview . What they did with my car seemed almost more important than what they did with me ! <p> " When I got onto the Los Angeles freeways , I was terrified . Highways were stacked on top of one another . Signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offramps flashed by . Finally I pulled off the road and burst into tears . Why had I wanted to leave this pleasant , familiar Vienna ? What had made me think I might want to work in this endless network of roads ? " <p> We were having Christmas cookies and after-dinner coffee in the curator 's Vienna apartment . It was on the third floor of the building he had lived in all his life . His grandfather had bought the building early in the century on the proceeds from a prize mineral collection sold to Harvard University 's Peabody Museum . His mother lived downstairs . <p> " Fortunately , on such occasions I always give myself plenty of time , " the curator continued . " So I arrived at just the proper moment . " <p> But the interview was not a success . <p> " Returning to Pasadena , I realized that I needed gasoline . I entered a station and stopped by a pump . Then I could not find the opening for the gas tank . I walked around the car several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stolen the car . So I drove off before he could report me . " <p> " Was it behind the license plate ? " my son Paul asked . <p> The curator nodded . " I discovered that later , " he said . " But at that moment I just wanted to get out of Los Angeles . " * * * " One of the worst things about that time , " the Czech woman said , speaking about the era of Communist rule , " was that I was not allowed to travel . My husband was a diplomat in Istanbul , but because I was a journalist ... " <p> Her voice trailed off . We were sitting in the small , utilitarian lobby of the Inter-Hotel Ambassador . Outside on Wenceslas Square , hundreds of visitors strolled Prague 's sidewalks . <p> " There has just been an ecumenical conference here of 80,000 young people , " our friend had earlier explained . " Most of them are leaving today and now there will be room to breathe . " <p> We had liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife Donanne , and I had watched the famous clock strike 6 o'clock the previous evening , the kids watching with us in the Old Town Square had applauded . It was fun to see the carved medieval skeleton rattle its bell and watch the tower windows open and the statues of patriarchs peek down at us . Perhaps it reassured us that a clock which had begun striking in 1410 was still to be relied upon . <p> As the applause died down , we heard singing . A bunch of the kids had gathered nearby , many of them sitting on backpacks and rolled sleeping mattresses on the old paving stones . A young man strummed a guitar . " We are the world , " the kids sang with a seeming conviction that they were and they could change it . A couple of young men walked about passing out candles and lighting them . " We are the world , " the young people sang . " We are the children ... " <p> " Still , things got better , " said the Czech woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a lovely smile on her face , and I felt confident that the Czech people would somehow succeed with the difficult transition they 're now moving through . " Long before the events of last year I was able to visit your country . I have a cousin in Van Nuys . He plays the violin and has a quartet . I visited Los Angeles and stayed with him . " <p> * * * The Orient Express had just pulled out of Keleti Station in Budapest headed for Vienna , and the Japanese man sitting nearby wanted to talk . He looked around the compartment , nodded at Donanne , Paul , and me and tried some German on us . He seemed relieved when we answered him in English . <p> " You are Americans ? " he asked , surprised . <p> Few Americans were traveling because the dollar was so weak . People kept mistaking us for Germans . <p> " I have a daughter in the United States , " said the Japanese man . " She 's married to American ! " He laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young German couple sitting at the window listened to our conversation , understanding it but saying nothing . <p> " She lives in San Pedro . My wife and I have visit her . " <p> " We live about two hours north of Los Angeles , " Donanne explained to the man . <p> " Ah so , " he said , brightening . " We have drive up the seaside , " he continued . " We have camp in Yosemite . Eat outdoors . " He did quite an expert pantomime of barbecuing with charcoal briquettes . <p> He turned out to be an engineer supervising the construction of a chemical plant near Debrecen , Hungary , not far from the Romanian border . His wife had recently returned to Kobe where they had a house ; he himself would return in February . <p> It was not until they came back from the dining car that the Germans joined our conversation . The man , Christopher , turned out to be a photographer/writer of travel articles for motorcycle magazines . He had motorcycled from Germany to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention of North Africa , the Japanese opened his wallet , unfolded a tiny world map he kept inside it , and showed us where he had supervised a construction job in Algeria . <p> We asked Christopher if he had been to East Africa , explained that we had lived there for four years and that Paul had been born in Kenya . East Africa sounded interesting , the young German said , but he had n't been there yet . He had , however , taken a quick trip to California . He had flown into LAX , driven immediately to Palm Springs , and raced from there to Tijuana on a motorcycle furnished by Kawasaki . <p> " You should go up the seaside , " the Japanese engineer told the Germans . " California seaside very nice . " He laughed and covered his mouth again with his hand . <p> * * * " You want a cheap vacation ? " asked the taxi driver in Vienna . It was the first day of the new year , chilly and overcast , and he was taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. " <p> I can not say that the first information I wanted to get this new year was that the region where I lived was good for a cheap vacation . " Oh ? " I said . <p> " I 've gone there every year since 1979 , " the cab driver said . He was tall , bald , and talkative . " One year my wife and I went on the Concorde . Cost me $8,000 . That 's where I left my hair , " he said , giving us practiced cabbie chatter . " The flight went so fast my hair never caught up . " <p> In his early 60s , the cab driver said he had been the first Austrian after the war to import a Harley-Davidson . In the quest for spare parts , he had struck up a friendship with the Motorcycle King of Fullerton , Calif . <p> The cabbie and the king biked together every summer . " This June we are going to Monument Valley and Yosemite and Phantom Ranch at the bottom of Grand Canyon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . <p> " We 're going on mules , " he told us . " They say 200 pounds is the limit for a mule . I 'm at 196 right now and I 'm watching it carefully . " <p> We pulled up before the bahnhof . " You going to Prague ? " the cab driver asked . When we said yes , he said : " That 's your second mistake , " without ever specifying our first . <p> " Have a good trip in June , " we said after pulling our luggage from the trunk . He waved and drove off to his next fare . <p> I did not bother to give him a tip . He had more resources than we did .
