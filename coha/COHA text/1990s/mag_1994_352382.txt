Soft on crime ? Next to being called a politician , that was every candidate 's worst fear this season . The desperate need to talk tough gave rise to a clamor for three-strikes-you're-out laws and other stringent penalties . But do those measures have anything to do with what works in the real world ? A street-level look suggests that the popular wisdom has it backward : <P> Sneakers , a Milwaukee , Wisconsin , gang member , comes by his nickname honestly . " It 's ' cause I 'm so fast , " he explains . " Real fast . " Especially after he snatches a purse . Or burglarizes a home . Or pulls a trigger . Sometimes , though , Sneakers is n't quite fast enough . He has already served three years for two robberies . Now 21 , Sneakers is a two-time loser on the prowl in a three-strike state . But he 's not worried that a third felony could put him away for life . " The law do n't make no difference to me because I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , if I really thought I was gon na get caught , I would n't commit a crime in the first place , now would I ? " <P> The same fate could have befallen Iman Reed . At age 11 , Iman liked to pick fights on the streets of Wichita , Kansas , making him a prime target for a revenge shooting . Then his mom enrolled him in a Big Brother program , which paired him with a police detective . Five years later , Iman is pulling down A 's and B 's in school , and has his sights set on a law degree . Reflecting back , he concludes , " If I was n't in the program , I 'd be in one of those gangs . " Or dead . <P> Sneakers and Iman personify what 's really at stake in the debate over America 's No. 1 concern . Sneakers is the kind of person politicians have in mind when they claim that they can deter punks from committing a third felony by threatening to lock ' em up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some candidates seem to think is the recipient of " pork " when they dismiss prevention programs as a waste of money . But two new reports suggest that those politicians have it wrong . An investigative report published Oct. 24 in the Los Angeles Times documented the failure of California 's three-strike law  --  one of the nation 's first and stiffest . The same day , the National Recreation and Park Association released a nationwide study of prevention programs , which offered compelling evidence that recreation and training can &lt; contribute directly to declines in crime and juvenile-arrest rates . The message may be getting through . A small but growing number of mayors and judges , most of them Republicans , are breaking party ranks to say that it 's prevention , not inflexible punishment , that puts a dent in crime .
