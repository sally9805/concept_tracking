Introduction " There are no new stories , there is only the rhythm of the times . " - Ezra Pound As the century and the millennium wind down , there 's a kind of bewilderment in the collective psyche : what is going on here and now ? It 's an artificial pivot point , but artifice can often seem more real , in terms of what it can reveal to us , than reality . In the writing classes I teach , all of my students are creating two kinds of stories : ones that take place more than a hundred years ago , or ones that take place ten minutes into the future . It 's too troubling to write about the here and now , for there is no apparent movement , just a stasis , a fog . All the movements are running out of energy : grunge in music , new narrative in literature , the Kate Moss waif look in fashion . We recycle things so quickly now that seven-year-old music is played at retro dance clubs . What 's left is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mannerism in art , the self-conscious exaggeration of what was once genuine . We are tapping our toes impatiently , as if we can resume our creative lives only after the ball drops and ends the century . Well , we tap one toe , anyway , because it feels like the other one is nailed to the floor and we 're capable only of walking in circles-pivoting , at best , in this direction and that . Gay men , especially , feel the pivoting . We are turning about but not , apparently , moving assuredly in any particular direction : protease inhibitors help some HIV-positive men live longer , but not all , and they 're not a cure . Born-again queers such as Gabriel Rotello and Larry Kramer think gay men should start behaving like heterosexual couples and settle down , while younger gay men feel they have the right to sow their wild oats just as Rotello and Kramer did . Legal issues such as gay marriage and partner benefits get caught in internal debate . Rather than presenting a united front , gays are discovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as ACT-UP and Queer Nation-and all sorts of other previously strong coalitions-have drifted even as they have succeeded in making real progress in gay rights . There 's infighting , even scandal and misuse of funds , in some of the most prominent philanthropic organizations . Things fall apart . Maybe " fall apart " is too harsh a description . " Become porous , " perhaps , is more accurate . After years of huddling in groups , gay men are going back into the world , living side by side with heterosexuals of every flavor . The wounds of homophobia heal , and we discover that on top of all the pitfalls of being gay in America , we are also prey to all the pitfalls of being American in America . Like all other Americans , for instance , we crave privacy . It was once a fact that the iconic American household had a wraparound porch with a big front door where people met one another and talked . Now we have back patios protected by high fences , and architects build houses with huge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house being a windowless , locked-down garage door that can be opened only by the owner with a remote control clipped to the sun visor of his or her car . We are tremendously private , but we bottle it up ; when we finally do see people , we are confessional . We divulge our secrets to utter strangers in therapy and on talk shows . The whole world is ours to study , in our private rooms , and the only way we can describe the world is in the way it shows how it affects us . Our stories are told too often in the " I " point of view ; how can that be anything but self-absorbed ? Well , it can be a lot of other things , actually . Look at how Allan Gurganus climbs into the head of a widowed preservationist in " Preservation News " ; how Tom House splits the " I " into two ( very ) different characters when a self-described blueblood meets a decided blue-collar at an art museum ; how Dennis Cooper 's " I " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egoless , or else nothing but ego . And the others in this collection using the " I " are more interested in what others are thinking : the " I " of Robert Glu , ck 's consideration of his father , Eric Gabriel Lehman 's " I " that looks with a kind of wonder and sympathy on a man who seems worse off than he . We are looking out into the world , and it 's ours , once again , to " make queer . " What other pitfalls do we face as gay Americans ? Like other Americans , we are waiting for our lives to become perfect , whatever that means . And because human life is not perfectible , it creates great disappointments among us . Perhaps one of the real atrocities of what is called pornography ( besides its lame misuse of language ) is that it portrays sex in perfectly choreographed ballets of bodies . How does a really good writer talk about sex-or anything else-without slipping into the tired language of porn ? Some of the best writing here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bruised in its purpleness , takes on the stuff of smut and turns it into a spiritual experience , one not void of humor and a relish for all that is imperfect and fumbling in sex , rather than for what is blandly ( and incorrectly ) laid out as a perfect moment . Eigo raises a bathhouse into the realm of myth , and he does so by avoiding cliche+ . The language is clean , but the bathhouse is n't . There are false starts , hurdles to jump , enemies to confront . Life is not tidy , nor is the good fiction that depicts it . Keith Banner 's characters bide their time in crummy jobs ; Matt Sycamore 's queens have to dodge the bashers ; people die ; relationships end . Everything falls apart . Rather , everything is made porous . Even in the literature category . In a bleak mood , readers like you and me can feel as if entropy has sucked the heat energy out of the literary world , or that our writers have worked the material far too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a child has mixed too many tempera paints into one big gray muck , and she has to wait for her birthday to get a new set . Look at all the true-confession biographies . Writers have turned to nonfiction as if in an ever-escalating competition to outdo each other in horrific experience : " I had sex with my dad ! " " I had sex with my dog ! " Another writing teacher I know offers a course in " creative nonfiction . " His waiting list is a mile long : everybody is discovering that fictional constructions and forms both afford for more room to tell some kind of truth that is more important than facts , and give a reader an enjoyable way to receive this truth . Writers subtitle their works unabashedly with words that seem , at first glance , a kind of waffling : " A Novel in the Form of a Memoir , " or vice versa . Fictional biography , biographical novels . Where does all this come from ? The line between fiction and nonfiction has been crossed and recrossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrow at the numbers of fictional memoirs and autobiographical novels being pumped into bookstores . No , there 's nothing wrong with it-there 's nothing that brings writing more vividly and emotionally to life than personal experience , whether dressed up or understated . But it does n't always have to be in the first-person point of view , and the best writers are discovering that there 's more than one way to spill one 's guts . That 's what makes the stories in this collection different , what marks them as something new and part of this strange , murky time . Do n't worry , it 's all here : the big names , the new names , the rediscoveries , the confessionals , the comings-of-age , the erotica , the multicultural diversity , the drag queen 's campy bitchery and the sorrows of AIDS , the families that understand and the ones that do n't , the sex , the drugs , the rock and roll . The stories , in general , never do really change , as Pound put it ; only the rhythm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiction of F. Scott Fitzgerald . You can see Hollywood in the ' 60s when you watch Elizabeth Taylor play Cleopatra . And you can hear the great gong of the late ' 90s sound when you read stories of puzzlement and conflict in this collection and elsewhere . Fiction today is doing one of two things : either breaking down into smaller and smaller special-interest genres or raising its head , seeking outside of itself commonalities and sympathies . Yet this anthology is more than just a time capsule or a dusty archive to show what we were thinking about as the new millennium approached . There are great movements afoot , signs that gay men have grown tired of navel-gazing and are beginning to integrate themselves into the culture at large . Much as we sometimes hate it , we are American as well as gay . But what 's really exciting , what 's really new and not muddy and not tapping its toes impatiently , is the number of authors who are using formal innovation to find new ways of expressing the truth . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional states . Thomas Glave 's " Whose Song ? " is set up and told like stream-of-consciousness crossed with African-American skaz , while Dennis Cooper 's " The Freed Weed " is written in the stripped-down , drugged-up style of somebody trying to get at the truth through sex , drugs , and rock and roll . Allan Gurganus 's " Preservation News " begins in the form of a historic preservation newsletter . Here is a way that queer writing is queered in a more subtle way : not just in showing gay men in gay sexual situations , but in providing a means of looking at the whole world through pink-colored glasses . What makes a story gay-the author or the content ? Is there a queer language ? Is there something that is inherently " queered " about the books gay men bring into the English language ? Yes , and in an exquisitely subtle way , a way that can teach anybody , gay or straight , how to speak that language . Any good writer , after all , teaches the reader a new way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the classic American novels-Toni Morrison 's Beloved , for example-have early chapters that resemble a kind of schooling . You must read slowly at first , as you learn the story 's alphabet , then its grammar , then its vocabulary , and then you 're up and running , you never want that language to become silent . Each and every writer has her or his own language to teach a reader , and maybe that 's what we call style , or originality , or genius . A writer who describes panty hose as " itchy fickle leg jails " is somebody who has spent a lot of time wearing panty hose . Those of us who have not worn panty hose can learn what it 's like to wear them , even if we 've never put them on . In the same way , great writers can give new insight into the most exotic , **35;30;TOOLONG things , such as lesbian sex or giving birth or dying of AIDS , as well as put a new spin on ordinary objects we deal with every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world new through our own , original desires . Some of my favorite writers have written thoroughly queer books that have few or no gay characters in them . Jeanette Winterson 's Gut Symmetries , for instance , or Art and Lies , in which Winterson defamiliarizes heterosexual relationships by familiarizing them to the queer sensibility . Similarly , Dale Peck 's Law of Enclosure makes but minor references to gay themes as it maps the rise and fall ( and fall and rise ) of a heterosexual relationship of many years . And yet I 'd call this , too , out-and-out gay fiction . William Haywood Henderson 's The Rest of the Earth , excerpted in this volume , is a novel that follows a man from a starting place in San Francisco as he travels east into the Wind River Range of America 's heartland during the great migrations of the 1800s . Henderson 's book is queer from tip to toe , though the word queer is never uttered ( or not , at least , in the way we use it ) . Walker Avery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general " Westward ho ! " ; he is a silent man taking his knowledge from women he meets along the way , yet he feels such an intense attraction to men he encounters that he trembles-as does the story 's narrative style-when they appear naked before him . I would even suggest , though I ca n't quickly say how he does it , that the way Henderson has written about terrain , landscape , and geography is bent , queer , gay original style . And once again , a queer author has taken a genre , in this case the Western ( arguably a hackneyed form with a tired language , like that of pornography ) , and revitalized it by looking at it through new , queer eyes . You can also see this in " The Future of the Flynns , " a story by Andrew Sean Greer . First published in Esquire , a magazine that tends to panic around homosexual material ( as it did when it pulled David Leavitt 's blow job Pridden novella during the same year ) , Greer 's story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious queer content behind something only a little subversive-who is that quiet little boy at the dinner table ? Imagine all those rugged straight men reading and loving that story and then finding out the truth of it-it 's like finding out that the chef served you muskrat when you thought you were eating chicken . What I 'm trying to say is that gay men write inherently gay stories , which may never have to have a queer character in them . What makes a story gay , then-the author or the content ? If it is indeed the content , then the content is much bigger than what we may think it is . The whole world is a rather queer place . ( Continues ... )
