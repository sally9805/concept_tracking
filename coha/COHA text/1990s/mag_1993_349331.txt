NELSON MANDELA <P> Q. How important a milestone is the setting of the election date ? <P> A. This decision to have an election by April 27 introduces an element of irreversibility . It is a landmark . <P> Q. Is it a safe assumption that you will be the next President of South Africa ? <P> A. ( Chuckling ) Some of the young men would not agree with you because they all want to be President . The opinion polls say that if elections were held today , the A.N.C . would probably win by an outright majority . It is then for the A.N.C . to decide who should be President . We have many dynamic people , and I would be prepared to serve under them . <P> Q. Do you believe De Klerk 's National Party will abide by the results of the election ? <P> A. I have no reason to doubt they are negotiating in good faith . But of course their concept of democracy is different from yours and mine . We have already encountered this problem in their concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that loses the elections should continue to govern . Now we have moved them away from that , and they are coming to accept our concept of a government of national unity which is based on majority rule . We are saying all political parties with a substantial following should be included in government , so we can face problems together . <P> Q. But in the end , wo n't their bottom line be permanent power sharing ? <P> A. My view is that they are moving away from that bottom line . <P> Q. Can you deliver on people 's expectations , or is the damage of apartheid too deep ? <P> A. Forty years of apartheid have been like 40 years of war . Our economy and our social life have been completely devastated , in some respects beyond repair . That was the situation in Europe after the last World War . What the Western world did was to mobilize their resources and introduce Marshall Plan aid to ensure that the countries of Europe devastated by the war recovered . What we expect  --  and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton  --  is that the Western world , led by the U.S. , should ensure that massive measures of assistance are given to the people of South Africa so we can address their expectations . <P> Q. What do you say to your supporters who do n't want to share power with former practitioners of apartheid ? <P> A. Last week I met the executive committee of the African National Congress Youth League , which has been vocal in criticizing the government of national unity . Quite understandably , they say , " These are the people who have been oppressing us since 1948 . We are on the verge of overthrowing apartheid and their government , and now you say we must work with these people . " That is perfectly reasonable . But we discussed the matter at length , and at the end of that meeting they accepted that the strategy of a government of national unity is a correct one . <P> Q. And what about those on the right who fear and might resist black majority rule ?         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
