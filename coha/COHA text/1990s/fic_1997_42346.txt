The waters swept the East Coast from Maine to Florida . Hourly broadcasts informed us that land was breaking off at an alarming rate . In some places the coastline had regressed to the Appalachians , sinking into the sea in chocolate-red chunks . Heads of families invested in nautical compasses , diving gear and water wings in assorted sizes and colors . I took to wearing my bathing cap at all times ; other women chopped off their hair entirely , fearful of strangulation . No one was safe . Even the pool players who , days ago , had barely deigned to glance at us in our wet suits , now flung their cue balls and eight balls up in the air in a great black and white geyser and fled in terror from the rushing spume . The few who thought to clamber up the skyscrapers were found huddling in satellite dishes , shivering in their jackets of soggy green felt . " Did you think love would be easy ? " I asked Hector who stood behind me , his chin resting on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with algae and sea acorns . " I was naive , " he murmured and nibbled my ear . <p> Since Saturday , Hector and I had been working for the Flotsam and Jetsam Relief Unit , and if we outstripped all other damage-control organizations it was because our methods bordered on militancy . We were neat and efficient , were welloiled as seals ; we could click our heels and pivot at a moment 's notice . But our task was no easy one . Conditions in the city had gone from primitive to feral . There were no blankets to be had ; waffle irons were a thing of the past . Looters and pillagers swarmed the city in droves . In the jewelry district , they grabbed tiaras by the handful and placed them rapturously on the heads of collies . Black pearls were dropped , fizzing , into glasses of anisette ; toasts were made . With diamonds as big as herne 's eggs , they scratched their names , tags , tic-tactoe and hopscotch grids on a variety of surfaces-glass , pewter , chrome , steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shattered , the moving steps thundering down in blocks . In the garment district they made off with bonnets and tallises ; in the plant district , ferns . Perhaps hardest hit was the poultry district . Youths were stuffing chickens , geese , loons under their greatcoats and running amok . Rumors , circulated by reliable sources , told of drumsticks and ostriches , of unsuspecting pigeons who were snatched from their statues and made into ladies ' hats . " The time is now , " I nodded to Corporal Spigot and leapt into the Hudson . I emerged with twins , one in each hand , and proceeded in the prescribed manner to shake them vigorously by the heels of their Oxfords , already puckering from the wet , and empty them of all they had swallowed . Beer cans , sea glass , variegated handkerchiefs , car parts , funnels and baby peas spilled out pell-mell , forming a pile so large that our packet boat sunk under the weight and we were forced to swim to shore . All around us the purpleveined blood coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , draped kelp on my breasts . I was a girl , an eel , a slippery nymphet . I waved to the dolphins that danced above and below me . And the more I dared to desire , the more I desired to dare . <p> Hector glided toward me , a sea anemone between his teeth , ready to tango . " My love is a rebel bird , " he crooned . " She is eyes without a face , she is a limpid pool , she is a newspaper boat , she is baba au rhum . " <p> " And mine is a fig leaf , a spool of spun flax . " <p> " A trundle , a bundle , a categorical imperative . " <p> " A crash of cymbals on a starry night . " <p> " The sun never sets on my lady 's buttocks . " He was up close now , forehead pressed to mine . <p> " Nor rises in the shadows of my lord 's downcast eyes . " <p> There were different explanations for the flood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories and were invited to colleges and talk shows where they were plied with rarebit and wine . Carpetbaggers and sponge-throwers conferred in back alleys ; charcoal-browed beauticians stopped tending their tea roses to give out free samples and advice . Shampoo coursed in the gutters in still white peaks until it was sucked gurgling into the sewer . People thought it was a sign . But it is you who know the truth , know it as well as I do , you who hold my beating wrists as the tide crashes and spanks the shore . It is you whose eyes , concerned and dark , follow my spreading fingers and spreading hair . It is you whose words are always polite , always inflected , and even as the highways tumble like ribbons and the cars slide like beads into the sea , it is your tender fingertips that touch away my tears . I turned to Corporal Spigot . " What do you recommend ? " I shouted , for the air was slipping into a vortex in the sky and the clouds had turned soupy gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tornado when I see one . It had been brewing for months , caused by inclement westerly winds , car exhaust and the wavy , ambivalent motions the go-go dancers had been making with their hands . <p> " The situation is tenuous , " Corporal Spigot barked back . " The roots will not hold . Neglect and ridicule have weakened the foundation of critical land masses , namely North and South America . Already the Florida Keys have broken away and are drifting toward Portugal . They will arrive one at a time . " <p> Armed with crates , barrels and pepper mills , we scoured the city . I was a woman with a mission . I knew I could take nothing for granted-not liberty , erotica , cheese , grouts , specialty shops or Naugahyde . Evacuation was the word of the day . It was the word on people 's lips as they bit into persimmons . It was the word whose syllables , vowels and flayed , spangled consonants were carried by the wind , the rain , by the hopeful blasts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray air . And the more I dared to desire , the more I desired to dare . By the busload and without discrimination , we collected cardiologists , housewives and shoe-shine boys and sent them to where the earth was solid-New Zealand , Cape Hatteras , Tierra del Fuego . " In regions such as these , the sediment , rich with ore and fossils , is lodged firm , " explained Professor A , a small potato-bellied woman with shiny cheeks and flippers who , for reasons I can neither disclose nor comprehend , was known to us as Alma the Aquatic Animal . " These are the sites of mastodon burial grounds , oily with molasses and musk . These are places that will not crumble nor fritter away , places for our tired and our poor , our aged and our young , our lapdogs and pack animals , to dwell in safety . " <p> On the Avenue of the Americas I found Hector filling his pockets with small luxury items wrapped in foil . " Look at the snug snug corners and the shiny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunlight so as to lose himself in an ecstasy of metallic flashing . I had seen this before . " Hush , gypsy boy , " I hissed and laid my finger on his lips ; Hector had the tastes of a crow . In times of leisure , he used to stud my dresses with pocket mirrors and twirl me about like a disco ball . But that was then and now was now . Bailey and his diving corps had sent us long , sifting ticker tape reports to the effect that the sea had become uneven . There were advantages and disadvantages to this . On one hand , it was almost impossible to find smelts . On the other , new tide pools were there for the wading . Crampp found the wreck of a Spanish Man of War , complete with streaming-haired skulls , amethyst brooches , gold pieces strewn casually on the ocean floor , a mermaid whose flowing hair and painted wooden eyeballs recalled to me your maiden aunt and a Grand Inquisitor who , with a sweeping bow and flourish of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y Cigarillo y Paella . I did not have time to answer his questions about metallurgy-the newfangled methods were far too numerous , too brittle-but I listened for a while to his discourse on torture , the rat , the hangnail and the oatmeal methods being , in his opinion , the most persuasive . In my opinion , he was merely flirting . He curled his mustachios , the two big and the two small and finally all four at once , producing a strumming sound not unlike a zither 's . " Life is a lackluster cesspool , " he declared . " Only zeal can keep us pure . " <p> " And turpentine ? " <p> " Turpentine , " he murmured , caressing the heads of his rosary beads pensively and one by one , " has its charm , I concede you , my fierce and lovely cross-examiner , my minx , my sphinx , my pet . But like the Lutherans , it is shallow . You can stir it , but ultimately , it does not stipple . " <p> I could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glacial runoff were trickling through the chinks between the skyscrapers . A unicycle boy-a rare sight these days , cowlicks and short pants having gone out of fashion-slapped a newspaper at my feet ; City Hall was eroding , one wet brick at a time . In the Museum of Natural History the stuffed stags and bison had expanded on account of the moisture , they said , drastically , they said , until they burst without warning from their glass cases , terrorizing the chestnut vendors . The situation was critical . I brushed and flossed , changed channels and selected alternative routes for reduction , baking and paraphernalia . Crampp came with blueprints and flowcharts . After I had a chance to peruse them , licking my index finger as I turned the pages , he disclosed a plan which started with a rash assortment of soap flakes and ended with saffron and chintz . Before I could comment , the unicycle boy alerted me to an assortment of smoke signals shaped like a funnel , a rabbit and a copy of Das Kapital . There was plenty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the counting ; there were chicken bones and boluses , freshly disgorged . But even these lose their allure when I see you , my love , my buttonhole , my dream of green . It is you who find music , halvah and telephones , not just one but an entire assortment , and you bring them in boxes wrapped up in string . It is you with your horned-rimmed glasses forgotten for days on your forehead , it is your papers I long to smooth and your hair and the lines in your face . I struck Hector with a spatula . " Give up the goat , " I whispered , chewing the starch in his cuffs . " We are meant for each other , you and I. " <p> " Drainage is all , " he replied . " Then we can clean house and gather pigeons , dice and spittle to our hearts ' content . " <p> " And marsh gas , too ? " <p> " And marsh gas , too . " <p> I climbed on his shoulders so I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as only I knew how , but he had already released his parachute and was coursing away , hair , legs and arms streaming in the wind . I sprinkled confetti , Q-tips , crushed ice . I remember snatches of song from my days as a Catholic schoolgirl , as a cocktail waitress , as a mistress of ceremonies at a county fair . But that was then and now was now ; the time had come to act . I knew it , the battalions knew it , the conquistadors knew it , even you , I maintain , you with your quips and glances , you with your games of jacksyou knew it too . I began to unwind the makeshift dam the concierges built out of safety pins , liver-colored bandages , chicken wire , nuts , bolts , hot crossed buns , funicular spinach truffles , Ajax bottles , pomade , locust jelly and playing cards that were red , ocher yellow , yellow with white spots , white with blue spots , plastic-coated , beveled or simply plaid . And the more I dared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wavelets scampered , grew , turned rabbit-like and fierce . They burst through the streets where bankers and barristers had strolled only a day before . They plunged down Nassau Street and Maiden Lane . They tore away stoplights , trash-can lids , candy-striped awnings with and without fringes . " Is this the end ? " I asked Hector . " Have I caught you at last , like a kite ? " <p> With a roar , the island city , its roots withered to a few mere threads , broke free . The El train halted , phone lines split ; even the diehard members of the Thirteenth Rescue Unit grabbed their Stetsons and fled . <p> As we reached the shore in the final moments of the day , the last people were boarding the Intrepid and sailing off for Tanzania with bananas as their ancestors did so many years before them . I turned to my man Hector , for the wind had picked up , and with it , new decisions . " Here , " I said ; " here and now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island , our eyesore , and here we would stay , even if we were the last ones in the Western world . On the boat , the full-skirted women were crying and waving good-bye with their polka-dotted handkerchiefs ; we waved back with our loofahs . I tore off my bathing cap and waved that , too , my hair streaming out like seaweed all around us . <p> " At last , " breathed Alma the Aquatic Animal , her eyes growing moist as the boat finally vanished . " A meeting of two worlds , and no less . " <p> Hector nudged me and pointed ; dawn was breaking . We could just make out Cape Cod as it drifted out toward Greenland , a half-moon on the horizon . <p>
