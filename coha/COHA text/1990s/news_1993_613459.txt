<p> Hueytown , Ala. - Kenneth Dunlap sat at a small table in The Iceberg Restaurant on Tuesday and talked about how the small world of Hueytown might change now that Davey Allison is dead . <p> " I do n't know how we 're going to get along without him , " Dunlap said of Allison , the Winston Cup driver who died early Tuesday morning after suffering injuries in a Monday helicopter crash . <p> Dunlap , whose mother , Gay Ann McCrary , owns The Iceberg , said he and others in the restaurant saw Allison almost daily . <p> " He was a friend of mine , " he said . " He came in here and would go to the back room just like anybody else . He was always laughing . He was n't any different now than when he was in high school . He still hung out with the same people and did the same things . <p> " When he got big it did n't change him a bit . It made him a better person . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racer who was Allison 's Busch Grand National crew chief , ate lunch at The Iceberg . Allison had catfish filets and french fries , a departure from the fried chicken he usually ate . Shortly after lunch he and Farmer made an impromptu visit to the Talladega Superspeedway in Allison 's new Hughes helicopter . While trying to land at the track Allison , who was piloting the aircraft , crashed . <p> " He ate the last meal he ever ate here , " McCreary said . " It 's hard for all of us to believe . " <p> Hueytown , a town of about 15,000 , lies 20 miles southwest of Birmingham . It is one of a string of communities - Bessemer , Dolomite , Fairfield - which grew in the early part of the century when the steel mills and the coal dug from the nearby hills made this the Pittsburgh of the South . Those days , and the coal , are largely gone . The USX pipe foundry in Hueytown that used to employ 11,000 people now employs 2,700 . Most people drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People think country when they think of Hueytown , " Dunlap said . " But it 's not that way ; country is 20 miles from here , down on the Warrior River . Hueytown is a town of working people . That hits the nail on the head . " <p> People who live in Hueytown are mostly from Hueytown . It is one of those communities whose attractions are not immediately apparent but whose natives seem reluctant to leave . Tuesday , signs in front of businesses sprouted messages to the Allisons , Hueytown 's first family . Black ribbons were tied to the doorways of businesses , and flags flew at half-staff . A vase of flowers delivered to The Iceberg had a card which read : " He 's not gone . He 's just gone one lap ahead . " <p> " The Allison family brought Hueytown to the attention of the world , " said Mike Andrews , who like Allison attended Hueytown High School . " He could have gone anywhere in the world to live , but he lived here . That said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cul-de-sac at the end of Church Avenue , a blacktopped road barely a lane-and-a-half wide , is the headquarters of the Alabama Gang . Behind a fence is the garage where Bobby and Donnie Allison began their racing operation . It was the Allison brothers , father and uncle to Davey , who along with Neil Bonnett and Red Farmer formed the gang 's nucleus in the days when they were tremendously successful campaigners at small tracks across the South . They would later take that success to Winston Cup racing . Donnie won 10 Winston Cup races and Bonnett 18 , one fewer than Davey . Bobby would win 84 races before a 1988 crash forced him to retire from driving . <p> On one side of the street is the home of Davey 's grandparents , the grandfather everyone called " Pop " dead a year now . On the other side is the modest brick home of Bobby and Judy Allison , who raised two daughters and two sons and who now have seen both sons die . Last year Clifford , Davey 's 27-year-old brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race in Michigan . <p> Tuesday , in the yards outside the locked gates of the Allison shop , relatives and friends huddled with one another as Hueytown police kept visitors and onlookers away . <p> " I really do n't know except I think that I and my brothers and sisters had the luxury of having a mother and father who gave us a strong Christian upbringing , " Bobby Allison said when he was asked how he deals with such loss . " Our parents gave us that foundation , a consistent Christian attitude . That 's all you can turn to at a time like this . " <p> " Lord knows how a mother and father cope with troubles like that , " said Elaine White , a family friend . <p> That sentiment , as uncomplicated as Hueytown itself , was the dominant attitude of the people here . And while they wished to reach out to the Allisons , mostly they stayed away from the far end of Church Avenue and gave them room for their grief . <p> " When Clifford passed away he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy , " said Dunlap . " It was such a shock . But its going to take a long , long time to get over this . " The town showed its feelings in simple ways . Most of the cars driving Hueytown 's streets had their headlights on , an incongruous reminder on a bright , summer day of what had befallen them . By midafternoon a banner above the street read : " Our sympathies to the Allison family . " It was signed : " The people of Hueytown . " <p> Down the same street on the football field where Allison played , a smallish defensive back for the Hueytown Golden Gophers , the grass was turning brown under the July sun . Three miles away , on Faircrest Drive , the dream house , where Allison lived with his wife and two children , lay behind a screen of trees . The house , completed just before this Winston Cup season , is 8,400 square feet , and there are three lakes on the property . A helicopter pad was being built in the backyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought only two weeks ago would be close at hand . <p> The late lunch crowd in The Iceberg went silent as McCrary turned up the television sitting on a back table . On the television , a National Transportation Safety Board inspector at the Talladega track was telling what little was known about the accident . No one in the restaurant spoke , but as the minutes dragged on and it became clear nothing had been resolved , Dunlap said , " All right , that 's enough . " <p> The sound on the television was turned back down , and the lunchtime murmur picked up again . <p> " Racing is over for me , " Dunlap said . " The only reason I watched was to see how my boy was doing . A lot of people in Hueytown were like that . He kind of put Hueytown on the map . . . . They 're going to have to have his funeral in the Birmingham Civic Center . That 's the only way they are going to be able to get all the people in. @
