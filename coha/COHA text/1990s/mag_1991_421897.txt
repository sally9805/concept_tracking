Yellowstone struggles to prevent a swan song <p> OF ALL THE BIRDS that inhabit the world 's wetlands , swans most often appear in fairy tales and mythology . The snow-white birds have been used as poignant metaphors from the beginning of ancient civilization ; even Socrates , prior to his execution in 399 B.C. , spoke his last words about a swan singing its sweet rapture . <p> But the song of North America 's rarest swan  --  the trumpeter ( Cygnus buccinator )  --  has not always had a storybook ending . <p> For millennia , few members of the waterfowl family maintained a higher profile in North American flyways than the indigenous trumpeter , the largest waterfowl species in the world . A veritable jumbo jet of a bird , it flaunts a wingspan measuring over seven feet and a weight sometimes topping 30 pounds . In flight , the trumpeter has a regal charm ; afloat , its graceful profile seems to harbor its own zen . <p> Until the early 1800s , the trumpeter swan inhabited scattered wetlands from coast to coast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used summer nesting sites  --  to the Gulf of Mexico , at the southern ' tip of the bird 's winter range . As early as the 1700s , trumpeters had begun to disappear from the eastern half of the continent , and by 1900 the species was in serious danger throughout its range . Today , some six decades after Congress took emergency measures to save the trumpeter swan from extinction , the species maintains only a tenuous foothold in the West . <p> Historians believe the swan 's large size and low flights may have hastened the demise of the species . Hunters killed trumpeters for feathers for the plume trade and for meat . Records show that the Hudson 's Bay Company  --  the major harvester of swans  --  traded more than 100,000 swanskins , most of them trumpeters , from 1820 to 1880 . <p> While commercial hunting was the primary factor in the species ' decline , some scientists believe that destruction of wetlands also played a role . Because of trumpeters ' characteristic loyalty-not only to life-long mates but to territory  --  they stubbornly home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those wetlands are destroyed or reduced in size , the swans continue to congregate at their traditional nesting and wintering sites , which become more crowded as habitat shrinks . Overcrowding results in loss of productivity , and some ornithologists say this is one reason the trumpeter is still on the wane . <p> Survival of the few remaining trumpeters 80 years ago  --  members of a group now called the " Rocky Mountain Population "  --  was tethered to a small comer of the greater Yellowstone region . Here , the isolated warm waters in Yellowstone National Park offered sanctuary , according to Ruth Shea , a swan biologist employed jointly by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Idaho Fish and Game Department . The U.S. Biological Survey counted only 69 trumpeters there in a 1932 summer census , while 100 others were thought to exist at summer nesting sites in the vicinity of Grand Prairie , Alberta . <p> Today there are more than 15,000 trumpeters in the world , and 75 percent of all breeding pairs outside of Alaska reside at least seasonally in the greater Yellowstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each winter in Yellowstone , at nearby Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge , Harriman State Park , and the vicinity of Grand Teton National Park , Wyoming . ( Together , Yellowstone and Grand Teton boast the only flocks of trumpeters within the National Park System of the lower 48 . ) This winter concentration of resident and migratory swans is considered significant because it represents the best hope of restoring trumpeters to much of their former range . <p> Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge , in Montana 's Centennial Valley , was created in 1935 by Congress in response to the trumpeter swan 's urgent need for protection . Then , as now , trumpeters were vulnerable to accidental shooting , ingestion of toxic lead in bullets and fishing jigs , poisoning , collisions with power lines , and human disturbance during nesting . Further , recent research shows that the production of trumpeter young , called cygnets , has been erratic  --  possibly because of overcrowded winter habitat or poor spring weather . <p> Even with those liabilities , the swan population outside Yellowstone is considered stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McEneaney , who spent a decade with the Fish and Wildlife Service before coming to Yellowstone as the park 's ornithologist , says the park 's resident colony of trumpeters is markedly dedining . " I do n't mean to say that trumpeters will disappear completely from Yellowstone , only that visitors may encounter only migratory birds in the future , " he said . <p> Meanwhile , Shea , who wrote her master 's thesis on swan reproduction in the park , says Yellowstone probably will never provide fruitful habitat for swans year-round . Ironically , Yellowstone was instrumental in rescuing the species , erroneously leading some to believe that reproductive conditions ' there were exceptional . " The park 's role as a temporary autumn sanctuary far outweighs its value for producing swans that live there year-round , " says Shea . " Now , during the autumn months when trumpeters are most susceptible to accidental shooting outside the park , Yellowstone continues to serve as a quiet refuge with high-quality food for hundreds of birds . " <p> Winters in Yellowstone are long and frigid , requiring birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm . Some waterways remain free of ice because of the constant influx of tepid water from geothermal springs , but these sites provide very limited amounts of aquatic plants , which are the species ' primary food source . Shea says the shrinkage of habitat when Yellowstone Lake freezes explains why a massive exodus of birds from Yellowstone National Park occurs each December , when hundreds of migratory swans move west to ice-free waters in Idaho . Those trumpeters that endure the winter in Yellowstone emerge in the spring so weakened that successful nesting is unlikely to occur except in the mildest years . <p> According to McEneaney , predation from coyotes and other scavengers also exacts a toll on nests , as does inclement weather and frequent flooding . Yel1owstone 's policy of " natural regulation , " which prohibits rangers from interfering with natural factors no matter how detrimental , means the outlook is bleak for maintaining a year-round population of trumpeters in the park . " My hands are tied , " says McEneaney . " But there are things we can do outside the park that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yellowstone at other times of the year . " <p> Where is the trumpeter headed , and what is being done to restore healthy populations ? A litany of factors is plugged into the survival equation , and each has relevance to the long-term protection of the species . The major stumbling block , says Shea , is persuading swans to leave their sanctuaries around Yellowstone and migrate once again to wetlands farther south . Simply , it requires biologists to help trumpeters relearn age-old migration routes . <p> When trumpeters were extirpated from their vast former range a century ago , the surviving swans lost the knowledge of wetlands beyond the greater Yellowstone region . Shea says it is difficult for swans to broaden their winter range naturally if they do n't know alternative sites . That is where Shea and Red Rock Lakes Refuge manager Dan Gomez come in . Unlike the hands-off management approach espoused by Yellowstone , habitat manipulation west of the park has taken various forms  --  some better than others , according to Shea . <p> No setback stunned swan conservation more than the disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks if February that year , when an arctic dr mass moved into the Yellowstone region , water along the Henry 's Fork in Harriman State Park froze solid , cutting off a third of the Rocky Mountain flock from its main food source-aquatic plants . As many as 100 trumpeters perished , forcing Shea and other managers to reassess the question of population stability . <p> " As long as we have most of the trumpeters congregating in areas where their habitat is vulnerable and the food source is insufficient , as we do in greater Yellowstone , we are going to have problems , " Shea concluded . " We also need to make sure that irrigators who own water fights on many of the key streams try to make accommodations for wildlife during the winter . " <p> To improve the birds ' chances for survival , government scientists have designed an unprecedented trumpeter relocation program to expose swans to new locations , which ultimately could mean the reestablishment of migration to wintering sites farther south . In 1991 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , in conjunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western states , transported 354 swans-representing 17 percent of the wintering population in Greater Yellowstone-to lower stretches of the Snake River in Idaho , the Salt River drainage of southern Wyoming , and Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge , Utah . <p> The action came in anticipation of a record 2,300 to 2,400 trumpeters descending upon the greater Yellowstone region and a 75 percent decline in aquatic plants at Harriman State Park . After the trapping , a winter census showed 1,931 swans spread across different areas of the ecosystem . Displacing the birds from Harriman and Red Rock Lakes prevented their starvation , a potential crisis that could have made the 1989 disaster appear mild , Shea said . More significantly , it exposed trumpeters to other winter areas  --  and these swans , in turn , may introduce their cygnets to the territory in subsequent winters . <p> By mid-March , wildlife biologists said the program appeared to be a success : fewer than 40 swans had returned to locations where they were captured . " It 's a start , " Shea said . " We wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far the reports have been favorable . We 've had good dispersal and very few swans immediately returning . " <p> McEneaney and Shea speculate that if migratory swans can establish a presence in watersheds throughout Wyoming and Idaho , the species ' range could rapidly broaden into Utah and Colorado and eventually link with restoration efforts in the Midwest . After being silenced for most of the 20th century , the familiar " koo hoh " call of the trumpeter may again be heard in potholes of the Great Plains as well . " The message of the trumpeters will be repeated each time these wild calls echo across the United States and Canada , " Shea recently wrote . " As they pass overhead , they will continue to remind us that wildlife 's future lies in our own hands . We have choices and solutions . " <p> Almost 2,400 years ago , Socrates said of swans , " You know that when swans feel the approach of death , they sing-and they sing sweeter and louder in the last days of their lives because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Shea holds a different view . " Socrates was wrong , " she wrote , recalling the painful counting of trumpeter carcasses on the ice two winters ago . " The swans do not sing as they die . But in their fading gaze lies a simple and crucial message . In our modern society , the future of wildlife depends upon human wisdom and stewardship and our willingness to share the earth 's resources .

According to ranger-ornithologist Terry McEneaney , this summer park scientists plan to complete a live-trapping program aimed at removing exotic mute swans ( Cygnus olor ) from a strategic wetland 50 miles north of Yellowstone at The Call of the Wild Ranch in southern Montana . <p> With the rapid increase in mute swans  --  whose numbers have grown from a single pair in the 1960s to 120 a few years ago at Call of the Wild-researchers fear these aggressive birds could invade the wetlands of Yellowstone and usurp habitat critical to the park 's dwindling number of resident trumpeters . In place of the banished mutes , McEneaney and other biologists have begun transplanting pinioned ( wing-clipped ) trumpeters whose cygnets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populations . " What happens outside of Yellowstone is just as important for the trumpeter as what happens inside Yellowstone , " McEneaney says . " It is important that we manage for the future of the species .
