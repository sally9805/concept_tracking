Like car owners who live in high-crime neighborhoods , commercial banks are facing ever higher premiums for insurance . Last week the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation moved to bolster the reserves of its Bank Insurance Fund by proposing a total hike of 7.5 cents next year in the premium that commercial banks must pay on every $100 in insured deposits . The boost is not because of an upswing in bank robberies . Rather , the bad real estate loans that bankrupted the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation are placing a serious drain on its former counterpart , the once seemingly invulnerable FDIC . <P> FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman has predicted that this year the FDIC fund will lose more than $5 billion for the third year in a row ; premium and interest income of $3 billion will cut the loss to $2 billion , leaving a total of $11 billion in the fund . Although Seidman has said he does not expect a major bank to fail this year , industry analysts believe Seidman 's estimate must mean that at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go under . The fact that the FDIC is setting up a 400-person " liquidation " office in Boston supports that speculation . <P> This year 's loss will give the FDIC only 60 cents of reserves for every $100 in deposits , the lowest level since it was founded in 1933 and less than half the level set by Congress . Seidman has asked for a 4.5 cents increase on top of a congressionally mandated boost of 3 cents , raising the premium to 19.5 cents per $100 . <P> Only the timing of the announcement surprised analysts . " Doing it this early will cause more concern about the banking system , " says Robert Litan , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . " But Seidman probably decided it would be easier now than later this year , when we might be in a recession . " Litan and others are convinced that the bulk of the hike will be absorbed by consumers in the form of lower interest payments , though people may hardly notice . If completely passed on , the increase would reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
