<p> Executives of Glaxo Wellcome P.L.C. , the pharmaceutical giant , said they were delighted to learn earlier this month that an independent study had found that one of their drugs was more effective for people trying to quit smoking than was the nicotine patch . <p> The study crowned a remarkably successful second career for the drug , sustained-release bupropion , which is sold for smoking cessation as Zyban . The drug was introduced in 1997 as an antidepressant , extended-release Wellbutrin . Later that year , the virtually identical drug  --  even the same grape color  --  was rolled out as Zyban . As Wellbutrin , the drug had $506 million in sales in the United States last year , while as Zyban , it had another $151 million in sales . <p> The chance for such lucrative second and third uses is driving nearly every big pharmaceutical company to try to expand a drug brand . While the trend is not new , there has been a recent upsurge in such activity as drug companies labor to maintain their strong earnings growth in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved uses for drugs  --  what the industry calls indications  --  have also increased since the Food and Drug Administration relaxed its policy last year on distributing information about an existing drug 's likely uses . <p> " Drug companies are definitely searching for additional indications more now than in the past , " said Ian Sanderson , a managing director at S. G. Cowen Securities . " The Food and Drug Administration is encouraging drug companies to conduct studies for the development of new indications . But generating new indications has become a way for the drug companies to rescue a flagging franchise . " <p> The Monsanto Company rolled out Celebrex , a painkiller for arthritis , in January and immediately announced that the drug was being tested to treat Alzheimer 's disease and colon cancer . The American Home Products Corporation has put Premarin , the world 's leading estrogen replacement therapy , back in the lab as a potential treatment for Alzheimer 's . Even the granddaddy of them all  --  Prozac  --  may find yet another way to make the world 's population happier . Eli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the popular antidepressant approved to treat severe premenstrual syndrome . <p> All are trying to find ways to increase revenues with minimal expense for research and development . By creating a second brand , they can do both with very little risk . For one , pharmaceutical companies do not have to replicate the research done before there can be clinical trials on people . That can cut years and some $20 million to $40 million from the development process . This reduced research and development budget means that second brands can have profit margins of around 85 percent , on average , compared with 80 percent for original compounds . <p> While drug research is extremely complex , doctors say that many compounds are capable of treating more than one illness . Once a drug shows some effectiveness within one of the body 's complex networks  --  the central nervous system , for example  --  it is often able to treat several illnesses common to that area of the body . <p> That explains why so many drugs originally used to treat depression have later been approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also note that compounds used in accelerated doses can also have different effects on the body . Ibuprofen is sold over-the-counter as Advil , a common painkiller . But at greatly increased doses , the drug is one of the leading prescription treatments for arthritic swelling . <p> Drug companies need F.D.A. approval before such alternate uses can be cited on a drug 's label . But the agency no longer frowns heavily upon pharmaceutical companies ' promoting their medications for other uses without formal F.D.A. approval . Drug companies can now give doctors information that has appeared in a peer-reviewed medical journal or textbook about an approved medication 's additional uses , allowing manufacturers to establish new markets for existing medications much more quickly . <p> The financial downsides are few . Since existing drugs have already passed the F.D.A. 's scrutiny , they are less likely to fail clinical trials for new uses . Should the drug fail those trials , the drug company loses some $250 million , analysts estimate , a healthy sum but quite a bit less than the $500 million required to develop original compounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall sharply as scientists become more sophisticated in their research techniques . Scientists now expect to find additional uses of drugs under development , while in the past , it was largely a case of being pleasantly surprised . <p> Pfizer Inc. had originally developed sildenafil citrate , best known as Viagra , in the early 1990 's to treat angina . The treatment ultimately failed , but Pfizer scientists were encouraged from the clinical trials when several men reported an odd side effect : erections . Sildenafil citrate was then developed successfully for male erectile dysfunction , what turned out to be an enormous market . Viagra had $788 million in worldwide sales last year after being on the market for only nine months . <p> " In the past , new indications for drugs were primarily based on good side effects that were uncovered in the clinical trials , " said Carrie S. Cox , senior vice president for global business management for Pharmacia &; Upjohn Inc . " But now we understand so much more about how a drug affects the body so much earlier in the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity . " <p> American Home Products , for example , has conducted more than 3,000 scientific studies on Premarin , an estrogen replacement tablet , which has been on the market for 56 years . Most of the Premarin studies have involved women 's health , which have produced a bounty of possible new uses . One study revealed that Premarin helps stop tooth loss in women , a symptom of osteoporosis . <p> " Premarin has been out for such a long time that we have a vast knowledge about the drug , " said Dr. Philip de Vane , vice president for clinical affairs at Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories , a division of American Home Products . " With tooth loss , people have realized that the jaw is like the spine or hips . Women can protect their teeth as they protect other parts of their bodies . " <p> In developing new uses for drugs , scientists have also become more thorough . When Monsanto was developing Celebrex , the company 's executives searched reports on diseases for any hint of medical effects drugs like Celebrex could produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these drugs could greatly reduce the incidence of colon cancer , while another by Johns Hopkins University suggested these medications slowed the progression of Alzheimer 's . <p> " These kinds of studies show us what the trends are , " said Dr. Philip Needleman , the co-president of G. D. Searle , Monsanto 's pharmaceutical division . " It provides us with the basis of doing a clinical trial . " <p> While expanding a drug 's uses should increase its sales , the new brand can deliver a few other dividends . When an existing drug receives F.D.A. approval for a new use , the pharmaceutical company sometimes receives an extension on the patent  --  which now lasts 20 years  --  but only in narrow circumstances . <p> By developing a new use for finasteride , Merck &; Company 's drug for treating enlarged prostates , the company received another patent on the compound . Finasteride was reintroduced in 1998 , in a different dosage , as Propecia , a pill for male pattern baldness . The patent on the five-milligram formulation of finasteride for the prostate brand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Propecia is protected until 2013 . <p> In theory , the extension should enable Merck to protect its entire finasteride franchise from generics , but that does not always work . Dr. de Vane noted that even with an extension on a new dosage , the patent on the original compound will still expire and invite generic competition . <p> Second brands can also cause other troubles . There is no guarantee the new brands will be a success , and , on rare occasion , can become more trouble than they are worth . Take Propecia , a pill that many analysts believed would rack up as much as $300 million in sales its first year . Sales last year totaled a modest $83 million worldwide , despite Merck 's spending some $91 million for advertisements promoting the drug to consumers , according to Competitive Media Reporting . <p> Yet , meager sales were far from Propecia 's only problem . When Propecia was introduced , Merck executives insisted the drug did not share Proscar 's research budget but instead ran up its own bill , estimated by analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace , it will take a little more than five years just to recoup the research money , without even starting to recover its advertising expenses . <p> A spokeswoman for Merck said the company was pleased with Propecia 's performance , noting that more than 400,000 men in the United States were using it after it was on the market for only one year . <p> Second brands can also sometimes confuse or even irritate some consumers . Glaxo Wellcome did not go out of its way to tell consumers that Zyban was actually sustained-release Wellbutrin . While the two drugs cost the same  --  about $1.16 a pill wholesale  --  some 77 percent of Wellbutrin 's prescriptions are covered by insurers , compared with only 47.6 percent for Zyban , according to the industry consultant I.M.S . Health . <p> Propecia users have been even less fortunate . Merck sold Propecia for three times the price , per milligram , than what it charged for Proscar . Since one Proscar tablet equals five daily doses of Propecia , many men began splitting the pills into five parts to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed to the drug 's sluggish start , given that men must take it for three months to see results . <p> Analysts say that drug companies sometimes increase the price of a drug that is used for a second indication to cover additional expenses . Not only will the drug company have to recoup its costs for consumer ads , the company may also have expanded its sales force to reach a new market . <p> Even with these setbacks , drug companies are determined to keep introducing second brands . Some executives even regard these new indications not as marketing tools , but as significant advances in science . And some appear to be . <p> " When we first began studying Wellbutrin , we had all these reports from people saying the drug helped them quit smoking , " said Andrew Johnston , who heads psychiatric clinical development at Glaxo Wellcome . " At first we had only anecdotal evidence that it worked . But we managed to confirm all that . Now we have shown that you can treat nicotine addiction without using nicotine .
