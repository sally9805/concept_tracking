hers , but today was n't a usual day and she did n't even notice the cool , soothing interior . She slung her canvas bag onto the foyer table and stalked straight through the living room to the balcony . Her anger was so overwhelming that she felt as if she had to be outside so it could expand . She stood rigidly still in the late spring heat of Los Angeles , her hands braced on the rim of the waist-high concrete wall . She had a good view of the city , and normally she loved it , both the pastels of daytime and the glowing neons of night , but she was too angry right then to even see it . Damn those narrow-minded bastards ! She had paid her dues , earned the fight to work on the Ouosalla dig in east Africa ; it was the biggest new archaeological find in decades , and her mouth literally watered at the thought of being involved . She had never wanted anything as much as she wanted to help excavate the buried ancient village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Red Sea . The dig was being funded by the Frost Archaeological Foundation , the very foundation she worked for , and she had been almost giddy with excitement when she submitted her name for consideration for the team being chosen to work on the Ouosalla site . Why should n't she have expected to be chosen ? Her work was excellent , and so were her reports ; her papers had been printed in several reputable publications . She had a doctorate in archaeology and had already been on several minor digs in Africa ; her experience would be of considerable value to a dig as important as the one at Ouosalla . Only the best would be chosen , but she knew that she was one of the best . She was experienced , dedicated and hardworking , and possessed the kind of nimble , commonsense mind that allowed archaeologists to piece together ancient lives from the fragments left behind . There was no reason why she would n't be chosen . But she had n't been , because to the pinheads who ran the foundation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : her name was Sherwood . The head of archaeology at the university had put it to her point-blank : The daughter of Cyrus " Crackpot " Sherwood would n't be a prestigious addition to any archaeological team . Her own work and reliability were overshadowed by her father 's reputation for propounding wild theories . She was beating her head against a wall and it infuriated her . Her father had always said that she had enough determination for three people , but in this instance she was frustrated by a lack of options . She did n't want to leave the field of archaeology ; she loved it too much . But the upper levels of her chosen career were closed to her , because of who she was . Archaeological digs cost a lot of money , and there were n't many sponsors around ; the competition for the available funds was murderous . Therefore no reputable team could afford to send her on a major dig , as her very presence would call into question the validity of the findings , and the team would then lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any good ; the world of archaeology was a small one and too many people knew her . If only it were n't all so political . The funding went to the big names that got the publicity , and no one would take the chance of getting bad press by including her . She had been on plenty of minor digs , but all of the important finds had been closed to her . Not that she would have changed her name , even if it would have done any good . Her father had been a wonderful man and a brilliant archaeologist . She had dearly loved him , and still missed him even though he had been dead for half of her twenty-eight years . It infuriated her that his many contributions to archaeology had been virtually ignored because of his wilder schemes and theories , none of which he had been able to prove . He had died in an accident in the Amazon jungle while on a trek that he 'd hoped would provide incontrovertible proof of one of his more outrageous theories . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death the more sympathetic had decided that he had merely been " misguided . " Cyrus Sherwood 's reputation had followed Jillian throughout her college days and her career , so she had often felt as if she had to work harder than anyone else , to be more accurate , more conscientious , to never show any of the flights of fancy that her father had reveled in . She had devoted herself to archaeology , never even taking a vacation , using every possible moment to pursue her goals . All for nothing . " Crackpot " Sherwood 's daughter was n't welcome on any major digs . She banged her hands down on the wall . He had n't been a crackpot , she thought fiercely . He had been a little vague , a little off-key , but a marvelous father , when he was home , and a damn good archaeologist . Thinking of him made Jillian remember the boxes of his papers that she had never gone through . After his death , Professor Sherwood 's papers had been packed up and the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the boxes to his dingy apartment and simply stacked them in a corner . He had no interest in them , and as far as she knew , they had never been touched . When Jillian finished college and moved into her own place she had offered to take them , to get them out of his way , but Rick had refused  --  more , she thought , because he liked the idea of having something that she wanted than because he himself wanted their father 's things . In that , as in most things , Rick 's reasoning had been faulty . Though she would never have destroyed her father 's papers , she had n't been panting to get at them . Quite the contrary . By then , Jillian had been forced to full , painful acknowledgment of her father 's reputation as a crackpot , a joke in the profession , and she had n't wanted to read anything that might make her believe it , too . Better to keep her memories of him as they were . But now she felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer . He had not been a crackpot ! Some of his theories were unconventional , but five hundred years ago the theory that the earth was round was also considered a crackpot idea . Her father had spent countless hours poring over maps , charts , and journals , tracking down clues , to help formulate theories . And in the field he had been superb , able to tell so much about the past by the few shards of evidence that had survived to the present day . She wished she had those boxes right now . Her father had never given her anything but support , and she needed that . He was gone , but those old records were more a part of him than the few mementos , mostly photographs , that she had . She wavered for a minute . This was the blackest moment of her career , the angriest and saddest she had been since she had learned of the professor 's death . She was independent by nature , but even the most independent person sometimes needed comfort , and this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel closer to her father , needed to refresh her memories of him . Making up her mind , she moved briskly back inside and looked up Rick 's number in her address book , thinking wryly that it was an accurate comment on their relationship that she did n't know it . In essence , there was no relationship between them in any emotional sense . He had borrowed money from her a couple of times , but on average she saw him maybe once a year , which was plenty for both of them . She let the phone ring for an entire minute before hanging up . Always realistic , she knew that it might take her a couple of days to get in touch with him , so she controlled her impatience and changed into her gym clothes . A workout was always good for stress , and she liked staying in shape anyway . Visits to the gym three days a week , plus jogging , kept her fit . Still , as soon as she returned home a couple of hours later , she picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her surprise , after the first ring there was a click as the receiver was lifted and a brusque , only slightly slurred " Yeah ? " barked into her ear . " Rick , it 's Jillian . Are you going to be home tonight ? " " Why ? " The second word was guarded , suspicious . " I want to look through those boxes of Dad 's old papers . " " What for ? " " Just to look through them . We never have , you know . We do n't know what 's in there . " " So what does it matter now ? " " I do n't guess it does . I 'm just curious . " Instinctively she did n't let Rick know how much she hurt inside or how she needed that contact with their father . " I do n't have time to sit here and watch you trip down memory lane , " he said , totally bypassing the possibility of letting her pick up the boxes and carry them home with her . Rick would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Okay , " she said . " Forget it . It was just an idea . Bye . " " Wait , " he said hurriedly . She could almost feel him thinking , picture the idea forming in his mind . " Uh ... I guess you can come over . And , uh , do you think you can spare some cash ? I 'm a little short . " " Well , I do n't know , " she said , not wanting him to think it had been too easy and maybe change his mind . " How much cash ? " " Not much . Maybe a hundred . " " A hundred ! " " Okay , okay , make it fifty . " " I do n't know , " she said again . " I 'll see what I have . " " Are you coming over now ? " he asked . " Sure , if you 're going to be there . " " I 'll be here . " He dropped the phone , crashing it in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with Rick was like that . Sometimes she wondered if he would ever see the futility of trying to spite her . She checked her wallet to make sure she had fifty dollars in cash ; she did , but it would wipe her out until she could get to an automatic teller , something she did n't like to do at night . She had plenty of gas in her car , though , so she would n't need cash for anything that night . It was worth fifty bucks to her to be able to go through her father 's papers right away , when she needed bolstering . She seldom did , being solidly planted on her own two feet , but sometimes even the most resilient plant wilted . Tonight her leaves were definitely drooping . She did n't bother changing out of her sweats because she was certain it would be a dusty , dirty job , sorting through those boxes after all these years . It took her forty-five minutes to reach Rick 's apartment complex . It was a trio of two-story buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked fresh lo , those many years ago when the complex was new but now was stained and faded to an unappetizing pinkish tan . Rick lived in the building on the left , on the bottom floor . The parking lot was crowded with vehicles in various stages of disassembly . Those that did presumably run were mostly in need of bodywork or were evidently in the process of getting it , since the main color was paint primer . The apartment occupants were in much the same shape , except for the paint . She knocked on Rick 's door . She could hear the television , but nothing else . She knocked again . " All right , all right , " came a faint , disgruntled answer , and a minute later Rick opened the door . She was always surprised by how pleasant and boyish Rick 's features were , how well his face had resisted the effects of cigarettes , booze , and his general life-style . His looks were fading a bit now , finally being worn down , but he was still an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You bring the money ? " " I do n't have much more than fifty , but I can get by if you need it , " she said , while thinking , Hello , I 'm fine , how are you ? She could smell the alcohol on his breath . Rick was n't much for manners when he was sober , but he had none at all when he was drinking . Unfortunately , that was most of the time . " Sure , I need it , " he snapped . " I would n't have asked for a hundred to begin with if I did n't need it . " She shrugged and took out her wallet , opening it so he could see that she was giving him every bill she had . Fifty-seven bucks . She would never see it again , but she did n't expect to . She gave him the money and said , " Where are the boxes ? " " Back there . In the other bedroom . " The second bedroom was a junk room , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for storage and , evidently , as a convenient place for tossing anything that got in his way , including dirty clothes . The boxes were stacked in a corner ; she fought her way over to them and began clearing out a space so she would have room to unpack them . " What 're you looking for ? " Rick asked . She heard the suspicion in his voice and knew he had n't quite believed her before . " Nothing . I just want to read them . Why do n't you bring in a couple of chairs and go through them with me ? " " No , thanks , " he said , giving her a " get real " look . " I 'd rather sip a cold one and watch the tube . " " Okay , " she said , reaching for the first of the boxes ; there were five of them , water-stained and fittingly coated with dust since most of the things the professor had loved had been dusty . She sat down on the floor and began tearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seal them shut . A lot of the material was research books , which she arranged around her according to subject . Some of the books , she noted with interest , were rare editions , which she handled with appreciative care . There were notes about various digs , articles he had thought interesting and saved , maps and charts of varying ages , and several spiral notebooks in which he 'd recorded his own ideas . These she opened with a smile tugging at her lips , for in the cramped handwriting she found again the essence of her father . He had had such enthusiasm for his work , such a boundless joy in reconstructing lost civilizations . He had never tried to rein in his imagination but had let it flow , trusting that it would take him toward the truth , which to him had always been much more fantastic than the most clever of lies . His zest for his work had led him to try to track down several legends , and he had accorded each one a chapter in his notebooks . Jillian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting enthralled at his feet or in his lap while he spun his wondrous tales for her entertainment . She had n't grown up on fairy tales , though in a way perhaps she had , but her fairy tales had been of ancient civilizations and treasures , mysteriously vanished .... Had they ever really existed , or were they exactly that , tales grounded only in man 's imagination ? For her father , even the faintest glimmer of possibility that they could be true had been irresistible ; he had had to track down the smallest of threads , if only to satisfy his own curiosity . She skimmed the notebooks , her eyes dreamy as she remembered the tales he had told her associated with each legend , but she noted that he had discounted most of the legends as myth , with no factual basis . Some few legends he had decided were at least possible , though further research was needed and the truth would probably never be known . She became furious all over again ; how could anyone dismiss him as a crackpot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed the facts very carefully and was n't influenced by the glamour or mythic proportions of his targets . But all anyone had ever talked about was his Anzar theory , his spectacular failure , and how his pursuit of it had cost him his life . The Anzar . She had n't thought about the legend for a long time , because it had caused his death . He had been so excited about it . The last time she had seen him , that morning before he left to travel to the Amazon in pursuit of the Anzar legend , he had been so exuberant , so enthusiastic . She had been a thin , awkward thirteen-year-old girl , almost fourteen , sulky at being left behind , pouting because he would be gone during her birthday , but he had hugged and kissed her anyway . " Do n't pout , sweetheart , " he had said , stroking her hair . " I 'll be back in a few months , half a year at the most . " " You do n't have to go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this chance to find the Empress , to prove that the Anzar existed . You know what that would mean , do n't you ? " At thirteen she had already had an alarmingly realistic outlook on life . " Tenure , " she had said , and he had laughed . " Well , that too . But think of what it would be like to prove the legend true , to hold the Heart of the Empress in my hand , to give its beauty to the world . " She had scowled . " You 'd better be careful , " she had scolded , shaking her finger at him . " The Amazon is n't a cakewalk , you know . " " I know . I 'll watch every step , I promise . " But he had n't . That morning was the last time she had seen him . They got the news about three months later , and it took another two months before his body was retrieved and returned for burial . Great-Aunt Ruby had come to stay with Jillian while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be interrupted , but after his death the house was abruptly sold and she found herself permanently installed in Great-Aunt Ruby 's tiny bungalow . Rick , though he was her closest relative , had n't wanted to burden himself with an adolescent girl . Besides , Rick had never forgiven his father for remarrying after the death of Rick 's own mother , and he had moved out as soon as he finished high school . Rick and Jillian had never been close ; he had barely tolerated her . The situation had never improved . Her father 's pursuit of the Anzar legend had ended his life and totally changed hers , not just in losing her father but in uprooting her from everything she had known , and even in the present his last quest overshadowed her own career . She flipped through the notebook , wanting to see his most personal thoughts about the legend that had cost her so much , but there was n't a chapter devoted to the Anzar . She laid the notebook aside and picked up another , but it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through two more notebooks before she found it , lying under the third notebook , which she had just picked up . It was plainly labeled on the front of the notebook in a heavy black script : The South American Anzar Civilization . It alone , of all the legends he had investigated , rated a notebook by itself . A thrill of excitement went through her as she lifted it out of the box and carefully opened it , wondering if she would be able to see what had so captured his interest that he had risked his reputation and his life to pursue it , and lost both . He had collected several fables and legends from various sources , she saw , all of which contained some reference to the Empress or the Queen 's Heart . The origins of these fables were impossible to pin down , though Cyrus Sherwood had meticulously researched them . They were neither Incan nor Mayan , yet seemed to originate from some advanced civilization . The fables had also referred to " the city of stone under the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In several versions of the fable , with minor variations , a great warrior queen fell in love with a fierce warrior from another tribe , but he was killed while defending the city of stone , and his warrior queen , from a tribe of bloodless winged demons . The warrior queen , or empress , was devastated by his death and swore on his body that her heart would never belong to another , in this life or the next , through all eternity . She lived to a great old age , and when she died , her heart turned into a red jewel , which was taken from her body and placed on the tomb of her beloved warrior so it would belong to him through all eternity , just as she had pledged . Supposedly the red jewel had magical powers ; it cast a spell of protection over the Anzar that kept them forever hidden in their city of stone under the green sea . It was the sort of tale that had sprung up in endless variations all over the world , with nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense interest in it . Or her own . Jillian sat back on her heels , staring at the notebook . Her heart was pounding , and she did n't know why , unless it was because her father had thought this legend important enough to devote a separate notebook to it . She felt tense , caught up in the almost painful anticipation that still colored his words fifteen years later . She began reading again . Almost an hour later she found the code . She stared at it , the childhood memory clicking into place . She grabbed her purse , scrabbled around for a pencil , and began transcribing the code . Only a few words into it , she folded the paper and crammed it into her purse , not wanting to go any further until she could do it in private . No wonder he had been so excited . She was sweating , her pulse racing . Her heart was slamming against her rib cage , and it was all she could do to keep from lifting her head in a primal scream to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done it . She knew it as she had never known anything else in her life , with a bone-deep conviction . Her father had found the Anzar . And so , by God , would she .
