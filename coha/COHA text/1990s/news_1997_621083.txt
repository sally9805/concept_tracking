<p> Stark numbers have the power to galvanize , and in the debate over minority admissions at the University of California , nothing seems starker than Boalt Hall School of Law 's revelation that none of the 14 African Americans admitted this year would be enrolling . <p> As the fall semester gets under way today , the Boalt numbers stand as a rallying point  --  both for those who fear a depletion of minorities in society 's professional ranks and for those who applaud the return of merit-based admissions . <p> But elsewhere around the UC system , the situation is hardly as straightforward . As the university enters a new era of color-blind admissions , its law , business and medical schools are resorting to a wide array of strategies to keep up minority enrollment , with varying degrees of success . <p> While some schools , like Boalt , are fastidiously keeping ethnicity out of admissions decisions , some are aggressively recruiting minority applicants with fellowships and poolside barbecues , while others have devised creative formulas that give an edge to poor candidates with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures reveals no neat pattern . The UC Davis medical school expects a fivefold increase in " underrepresented minorities "  --  blacks , Latinos and American Indians  --  who benefited under the old system . Yet at Berkeley 's Haas School of Business , the number of minorities will drop by more than half . <p> " We 're in the middle of an ideological dispute about what is illicit discrimination and what is permissible consideration of race , " said Boalt professor Rachel Moran , member of a faculty committee studying law school admissions . " We 're in a period of uncertainty . That 's reflected in the variance among schools in the results . " <p> As debate over affirmative action continues nationwide , UC has emerged as case study number one . Two years ago , UC regents voted to dismantle affirmative action in admissions . The changes wo n't affect undergraduates until next year , but graduate students entering this fall were the first to apply under the new rules . <p> With the nation 's top professional schools under pressure to boost student diversity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , UC admissions officers now find themselves lacking a tool that most others are still using . <p> At Boalt , the number of underrepresented minority candidates admitted dropped from 167 to 55 . All but seven  --  including all 14 African Americans  --  chose to enroll elsewhere . The new class will have only one African American  --  a student who was admitted last year but deferred . <p> " It feels strange to be part of this class , " said another incoming student , Alex Huneeus of San Francisco , who is Chilean . " It must be one of the first classes since the 1950s that is so lacking in diversity . " <p> Huneeus , 29 , turned down Yale to attend Boalt . " Part of my decision to go to Boalt was because it was a state school , and I thought there would be more diversity , " she said . " I was pretty shocked and disappointed when I found out there would n't . " <p> Minority enrollment is also way down at Berkeley 's Haas School of Business . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 enrolled . This year , only 30 got in , and 11 plan to attend , according to preliminary figures . <p> As at Boalt , Haas officials said the minority applicants who are admitted without affirmative action are naturally the ones most aggressively courted by other schools . <p> " We 're one of the five most selective programs in the country , " said Fran Hill , MBA admissions director at Haas . " The people we are admitting are so strong , they have a ticket to any business school in the country . " <p> At UC 's medical schools , minority enrollment was eroding well before the regents ' vote , falling from a peak of 117 in 1992 to an expected 69 in this year 's entering class . <p> Administrators say that intense public scrutiny had already forced them to become more careful about affirmative action in the admissions office . Davis , San Diego and Irvine , for example , used to review all affirmative action candidates in a separate pool  --  until a few years ago , lawyers advised them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop in minority applicants , the five medical schools expect to enroll almost as many minority students as last year  --  69 , as compared with 73 . <p> Law schools tend to place considerable emphasis on applicants ' test scores , and because average scores of African Americans and Latinos are lower , affirmative action played a greater role in admitting them . Medical schools , on the other hand , tend to conduct a more holistic review of their applicants  --  including interviews evaluating the personal qualities of these potential physicians . <p> " Those of us who are in medical education realize that test scores are not the sine qua non of a good physician , " said Ernest Lewis , an associate dean at UC Davis ' medical school . " Beyond that are drive , humanitarianism , the need and desire to help other people . Those are the kinds of things we look for . " <p> The number of first-year minority students at Davis plummeted from 31 in 1993 to to 2 in 1996 , and despite the regents ' vote , Lewis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now off-limits , the regents had encouraged the use of socioeconomic considerations in admissions decisions . So Lewis and his team decided to take into consideration applicants ' home zip codes , giving extra points to those from " medical service shortage areas , " which tend to be poorer neighborhoods . <p> The number of minority candidates admitted dropped from 36 last year to 31 , but while only two enrolled last year , 10 plan to enroll this year . " When we found ourselves having accepted some minority students through the new process , " Lewis said , " we recruited hard . " <p> Aggressive recruitment also seems to be making a difference at UCLA 's Anderson Graduate School of Management . " We had to work very hard on the yield , because of the chilling effect of ( the regents ' policy ) , " said admissions director Linda Baldwin . <p> POOLSIDE BARBECUE <p> Last spring , faculty and alumni launched an energetic drive to recruit minority students  --  sweetening the deal with corporate money for minority fellowships and holding special recruitment events . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wealthy black alumnus who lives in Los Angeles ' Ladera Heights , an affluent African American neighborhood , apparently helped . " We felt it was a culturally specific way to get the candidates , " said Baldwin . <p> Although UCLA admitted fewer underrepresented minorities  --  49 , down from 61 last year  --  the number who decided to enroll barely dropped  --  from 31 to 28 . One student turned down Harvard , Stanford , and Northwestern to come to UCLA . <p> WARM WELCOME <p> The UCSF School of Medicine has also managed to keep minority enrollment from falling , despite a significant drop in the number of applicants . <p> Michael Drake , associate dean for admissions , said he places a high priority on making minority applicants feel that they are welcome . For instance , when they visit the campus , they are interviewed by a fellow minority . <p> " I do n't think they ( the regents ) told us we could n't do that , " said Drake . <p> Regent Ward Connerly , author of UC 's new race-blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of racism , " he said . " We do n't do that with white students . It says that the people who are applying . . . somehow think of themselves first and foremost as blacks and Latinos . I do n't buy that group-think mentality . " <p> Connerly does not oppose other efforts to land qualified applicants who have already been accepted . " You 're letting some of those who won the competition know that you want them to attend , " he said . " I do n't have any problem with that . " <p> At Boalt , some students and faculty fault the school for not doing enough minority recruitment . " We 've never needed to do that before , " said Dean Herma Hill Kay . " Obviously we will have to try to find ways to do it . " <p> But the future of minority recruitment efforts could hinge on Proposition 209 , the anti-affirmative action measure passed last year , which is currently held up in the courts . If 209 is upheld , some legal experts say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term , most of the attention is likely to remain focused on Boalt , where declining minority enrollment is attracting federal scrutiny . The U.S. Office of Education is investigating the matter in response to a complaint from civil rights groups . <p> Some at the university see the falling minority numbers as proof that the old system was admitting less-qualified students simply because of their race . Martin Trow , an emeritus professor of public policy , said the drop in minorities at Boalt reveals " the true face of affirmative action  --  a pattern of gross racial and ethnic discrimination . " <p> But some alumni and local lawyers plan to mark the start of school today with a polite protest against what they describe as the " resegregation " of the legal profession . <p> " I graduated in 1967 from a segregated high school in Mississippi , " said Peter Benvenutti , a Boalt graduate and a partner at Heller , Ehrman , White &; McAuliffe in San Francisco . <p> " It never occurred to me . . . that there would be any chance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law school , would complete that unfortunate cycle and end up in a racially segregated law school run by the state of California , " Benvenutti said . " The prospect of that happening is shocking beyond words . " <p> CHART ( 1 ) : .
