<p> WILSON 'S ACTION THREATENS WATER ACCORD <p> Editor  --  Governor Pete Wilson is muddying the waters of a landmark water agreement in California . <p> He is demanding that water already allocated to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and San Francisco Bay for restoring fisheries and water quality be siphoned off to agribusiness . <p> By caving in to agribusiness interest , the governor is destroying a civilized political accord of historic proportions between previously warring interests  --  environmentalists , fisheries , farmers , cities and water districts . <p> The demand for more subsidized water to grow water-gulping cotton in the arid Central Valley and water-intensive rice in fields of Northern California exposes the corruptive power of money in our weakening political system and the greed of men willing to quench their thirst for profits on water-guzzling crops commanding big government subsidies . <p> Do n't shut off the water , just shut off Pete Wilson 's water . <p> JAMES LYNCH <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> A STUPID VETO <p> Editor  --  Governor Pete Wilson 's recurring attacks on immigrants are just plain mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for illegal immigrant women is just plain stupid . <p> Whether he likes it or not , the minute the child is born it is a U.S. citizen . This means we will pay the high cost of any physical or mental debilities caused by lack of prenatal care for the mother . <p> JANE MORRISON <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> A PARK FOR THE MISSION <p> Editor  --  Thanks to Carla Marinucci for her terrific coverage of Mission community efforts to turn the vacant lot at 23rd and Treat streets into a park . With all the attention on Golden Gate Park lately , we are in danger of forgetting the small open spaces right in our own communities that are so important  --  neighborhood parks . We need them to be safer , cleaner , greener ; and we need more of them . <p> What a coup it could be for the politician who steps up to bat for this project , makes the right thing happen and re-cuts the ribbon on a desperately needed new Mission District park . Who will step forward ? <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with profit and politics . It 's time for them to put their usual pettiness aside and work for the good of the people of our city : we want a beautiful clean new park at 23rd and Treat . <p> ELIZABETH SULLIVAN <p> Neighborhood Parks Council <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> MARCHANT GARDEN DEBATE <p> Editor  --  John Willis 's recent letter criticizing Jon Carroll 's cover story on the threat to the Grace Marchant Garden contains several misleading and untrue statements . While we have no quarrel with Mr. Willis 's reputation as a developer in San Francisco , his bending of the truth illustrates the threat that his proposal has for the garden and the Telegraph Hill Historic District . <p> Mr. Willis states in his letter that the PG &E; shadow study shows that the proposed development " casts no shadow on the existing garden . " He has provided us with a copy of that study and it is clear to anyone viewing that study that a substantial shadow is cast on the garden during a considerable part of the year , particularly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the previous building , which was considerably smaller in bulk and height . <p> When Mr. Willis further states that he has offered to grant an easement on the rear of his property to " expand " the garden , he is offering nothing more than what the garden already has . The rear portion of this property is now part of the Grace Marchant Garden , and has been since Grace started her work there in 1949 . In fact , the proposed development , if allowed to proceed without making this defacto easement legal , would considerably diminish the garden as we know it now . <p> If Mr. Willis is indeed in favor of preserving this " most magical place , " then there is a simple solution . The community has offered to purchase the lot on which the condos are proposed to be built for permanent preservation , at a price that would fairly reimburse the investment expenses so far incurred by Mr. Willis and his partners . We await their response . <p> WELLS WHITNEY <p> President <p> Alta/Filbert Preservation Assoc . <p> . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-development resident , I am more than a little surprised by the recent actions of the mayor in dismissing the president of the San Francisco Landmarks Preservation Board . The stifling of individuals who voice well-informed concerns about specific projects will ultimately , I am afraid , create a backlash which will hinder intelligent development in San Francisco . <p> The mayor seems a little too concerned about a mere advisory panel and a little too unconcerned about what voters really care about : the sorry state of Muni ( and transportation in general ) , issues concerning the homeless , the condition of our parks , etc , etc. , etc . As for his typically flip suggestion that landmarks activists elect a different mayor ( Chronicle , August 14 ) , he should know that many residents , not just landmarks activists , are yearning for at least a little candor , consistency and integrity from City Hall . <p> MARTIN PITHA <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> HOW ABOUT SOME MURALS ? <p> Editor  --  In response to your article on artist Buster Simpson 's foot sculpture : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murals throughout the city . On average the cost of painting a mural runs between $ 5,000 and $ 30,000 . On average the city of San Francisco only commissions 8 to 12 murals per year through the mural resource center and the mayor 's office . As a muralist , I find myself asking why the Arts Commission would fund one project when it could benefit so many neighborhoods and so many artists by spreading it around a little . <p> On the other hand , if the commission does decide to go ahead with this sculpture , the public should be made aware of the actual costs of materials and time involved in fabricating such a piece . In the end it usually ends up costing the artist an arm and a leg ( and a foot ) . <p> DAN FONTES <p> Oakland <p> . <p> COLOSSAL PIECE OF JUNK <p> Editor  --  Is anyone else as outraged as I am ? <p> In this supposed citadel of compassion , we have children wanting for an education , adults wanting for useful job skills , productive citizens being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cardboard boxes and wandering filthy streets . Yet , our Board of Supervisors is seriously considering dropping half a mil of our money for a colossal piece of junk to satiate its foot fetish ! <p> CHARLES KROUPA <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> TAKE AN EXTRA STEP <p> Editor  --  An eighteen-foot foot  --  granite , marble or plastic  --  is not art . It is a symbol . Are we so shallow a culture that we ca n't take that extra step beyond Warholian banality and celebrate true creativity ? <p> VIKSHUNAL NAIM <p> Mill Valley <p> . <p> STANLEE GATTI 'S ' TALENT ' <p> Editor  --  I resent Stanlee Gatti 's remark calling Beniamino Bufano 's work " second rate . " Mr. Gatti should confine himself to what he does best  --  floral decorating . <p> ELIZABETH STILLMAN <p> Oakland <p> . <p> ANNOYING STICKY STRIPS <p> Editor  --  I have received several postcards from friends traveling abroad on their vacations , and invariably these postcards come with a nasty strip of sticky paper covering part of my address and very often ( 99 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friend 's name . I find this extremely irritating because some of the card adheres to this sticky strip and ruins the card . <p> Annoying ? Yes , very . <p> And why does the Post Office have to do this ? <p> ELIZABETH M. ROSS <p> Santa Clara
