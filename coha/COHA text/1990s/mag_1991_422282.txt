Section : Cover story Public opinion and the law have changed radically in recent years <p> Three New England Patriots and the football team itself are fined nearly $50,000 for lewd gestures and remarks to a female reporter in their locker room . The majority leader of Florida 's House of Representatives is admonished and loses his position for allowing an " offensive , degrading and inappropriate ' atmosphere of sexual innuendo on his staff . Two female police officers in Long Beach , Calif. , win a $3.1 million verdict after three years of sexual taunts from colleagues . Until very recently , sexual harassment on the job was largely hidden . But the cathartic showdown between Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill confirms that a sea change is underway . <p> The controversy has put men on trial for behavior that women say is as commonplace as it is ugly . Recent surveys have found that roughly 40 percent of women report having been sexually harassed at work . Marilyn Quayle said last week she had been a victim in law school . In a new New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having done something that a woman might have viewed as harassment . There is little dispute over the extremes of conduct . Asking a female colleague for a date is fine ; demanding sex from a subordinate as a condition of employment is not . But there are still many gray areas on which the law  --  and public opinion  --  are not clear . What if a woman repeatedly refuses dates with a coworker but he wo n't give up ? Is it harassment if a man tells off-color jokes or displays photos of nudes in the presence of female colleagues ? What if one woman is offended and others are not ? <p> Unaware or afraid . The law has evolved in favor of feminist arguments to broaden the definition of harassment . But few women have taken advantage of the change because they are either unaware of their rights or afraid to exercise them . " Women are subjected to a barrage of sexual innuendo , pictures and verbal abuse , and most do n't have the vaguest idea that they do n't have to put up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Law Center . <p> For the few who do fight , the law is not much of an ally . Federal law permits recovery only of lost wages and bars the punitive damages that other plaintiffs win to penalize companies  --  money that can tide women over until they find new jobs . Most who file complaints " have no choice but to quit because the work environments become so uncomfortable , ' says Barbara Hadsell , attorney for the Long Beach police officers . <p> The problem of sexual harassment was barely recognized as a legal wrong until the past decade , after women had entered the work force in large numbers . When a Washington , D.C. , woman complained in the mid-1970s of retaliation by a supervisor after she refused to take part in an " after-hours affair , " a federal judge ruled that the 1964 Civil Rights Act , which bars sex discrimination , did not apply . Feminist scholar Catharine MacKinnon contested that finding in her 1979 book " Sexual Harassment of Working Women . ' MacKinnon , whose father sat on the appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " intimate violation of women by men ... has become institutionalized , ' and argued that Congress had intended to make it illegal under the Civil Rights Act . <p> Yet it was years before the argument took hold . In the meantime , most women who dared go to court lost.A judge cleared an Oklahoma company of liability for harassment by a vice president onthe ground that the firm maintained a policy against it and was unaware of the officer 's actions . An Arizona judge rejected the case of a woman who said she had lost out on reappointment to a government job because she had rebuffed her new boss 's sexual advances , on the ground that the episode occurred before he became her supervisor . <p> Eventually , a Washington bank teller named Mechelle Vinson brought the breakthrough case . Vinson charged that her boss had demanded sex and that she had succumbed for fear of losing her job . Aided by a brief written by MacKinnon , Vinson won a Supreme Court declaration in 1986 that employers condoning a " hostile environment " against women violated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led a unanimous court in finding it unnecessary for Vinson to suffer economic loss to win her case . <p> The reasonable woman . Vinson 's victory encouraged feminists to pursue new theories that would better reflect the women 's view of office flirtations . They argue that harassment charges should be judged from the viewpoint of a " reasonable woman , " a concept already adopted by a few courts . A San Francisco federal appeals panel ruled this year that a female Internal Revenue Service agent could pursue a suit accusing a fellow agent of pestering her with sexual innuendoes in conversation and love letters . The court said a " reasonable woman " could consider the actions " sufficiently severe and pervasive to ... create an abusive working environment . ' Another ruling by a Florida federal judge declared that photos of nude women that dotted a Jacksonville shipyard were legitimate evidence of sexual harassment . Last year , a California court allowed a nurse to pursue a suit against a hospital . She charges that it did not stop an obstetrician from harassing other nurses by grabbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The case established that even women who were not themselves damaged by harassment could sue on behalf of others . <p> The lengthening list of court cases has opened up the possibility that otheraspects of men 's behavior could be grounds for a harassment finding . The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , Thomas 's former agency , has issued 31 pages of guidelines to employers . The EEOC says repeated " unwelcome " advances can be the basis for a complaint , but does not set a quota . " The courts typically look at the severity of the case and the totality of the circumstances , ' says law Prof. Ronna Schneider of the University of Cincinnati . " A man probably can get away with one free sexual joke or one free pinch . ' Sharp attitudinal differences between men and women exacerbate the uncertainty over correct behavior . One study has found that most men would be flattered if a woman propositioned them at work , while a majority of women said they would be offended by such behavior from men . <p> Even if courts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have little incentive to come forward . The number of complaints filed with the EEOC increased to 5,700 last year compared with 3,700 a decade ago , but a majority of cases never win recompense . ( Almost all charges are filed by women ; a handful are brought by men against women or other men . ) Roughly 2 out of every 3 cases go nowhere . Susan Reilly , director of the EEOC 's Washington field office , says : " The woman says this is what happened , the man says that is what happened , ' and no third party can establish the truth . State agencies also are receiving scores of harassment claims . In California , 1,744 complaints have been filed in the past year . <p> ' He wanted something to happen . ' To speed what can be a painfully slow legal process , the EEOC promised this year to expedite urgent cases . The first was filed on behalf of Maureen Palma , 26 , who charged that the co-owner of a small New Jersey towing firm where she worked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made it known he had a sexual attraction to me and wanted something to happen , ' she maintains . It started with subtle comments , but eventually , she says , her boss called her a bitch , whore and slut for spurning him . Just as the EEOC prepared to seek a court order barring her dismissal for complaining , she was fired . The firm settled in July by giving Palma $5,000 in back pay and agreeing to post notices acknowledging employee rights to complain of sexual abuse . " I did n't go into this for money , ' says Palma , who now works elsewhere . " I wanted to let people know what 's really going on . ' <p> Despite highly publicized victories by harassment accusers , others find that winning in court is no sure thing . Consider the case of Karen Kouri , a suburban Virginia woman who said her boss at a shipping firm crossed the line by sending her greeting cards and gifts , insisting on walking her to her car each night and sometimes to the bathroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's case in February , noting that the man had not asked for sexual favors and that Kouri had sent " mixed signals " by not adequately protesting his actions . " The harassment in this case was not unwelcome , ' said the judge . <p> A few women have won large damage verdicts under state laws , but psychic pain remains . Last month , a jury awarded $3.1 million to former Long Beach , Calif. , police officers Lindsey Browne-Allison , 33 , and Melissa Clerkin , 36 , after hearing evidence that the police department was a male enclave where women regularly were ridiculed through vulgar language and obscene behavior . Clerkin says she was called a lesbian and once found a vibrator in the shape of a penis in her patrol car . Browne-Allison says male officers talked graphically about sex acts in front of her and urinated outdoors in her presence . " I won the case but lost my career , ' says Browne-Allison , who took a stress-related disability leave three years ago and is now studying photography . " Fighting this led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever to be a police officer again . ' For Clerkin , who also left the force and may return to school , the worst part is knowing that little has changed : " All the same officers are still working there and have n't received any discipline . For them it 's all just a big joke . ' <p> The high costs of fighting sexual harassment make suffering in silence a far more appealing alternative for most women . " Many strong , successful professional women have made conscious decisions to ignore the sexual harassment in their offices because they know that as soon as they complained , there would be 50 others waiting to take their jobs , ' says Naomi Wolf , author of " The Beauty Myth : How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women . ' She says it is harder for today 's career women to fight back than it was for feminist pioneers who had everything to gain and nothing to lose by challenging abuse . <p> Women may feel ambivalent about confronting powerful male mentors who could have enormous influence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defining issues in the Thomas-Hill controversy : why she waited a full decade to bring her case to light . Many women say that is not only plausible but typical . A former manager at a West Coast high-tech firm who was sexually harassed by her boss while in her 20s says : " I was a kid . I was trying hard to succeed . I told myself that this is the time to work hard , to jump through hoops , not the time to be spitting in people 's faces and saying ' I wo n't put up with this . ' ' <p> As more women decide to take action  --  whether within company walls or outside  --  they will press for more legal benefits . Feminists are now asking Congress to expand the level of monetary damages that harassed women may win in federal courts , although the civil-rights legislation that includes the clause is tied up in a long-running dispute over racial quotas . The Supreme Court will consider a Georgia case this term that could allow such damages to be awarded in harassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taking the initiative by offering films and seminars on sexual harassment and issuing guidelines for appropriate on-the-job behavior between men and women . Although such measures can prevent blatant harassment , " employers are concerned about being caught in the gray area when one employee is accused of creating a hostile environment for another , ' says Mona Zeiberg of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . While companies and courts sort out the rules , some social relationships in the office will be inhibited . Anthropologist Lionel Tiger of Rutgers University predicts a " return to a kind of Victorian period ' in which some men will be reluctant to try developing relationships with any woman who initially seems aloof . <p> Take responsibility . Some experts say that male-female tensions eventually will ease only if women who believe they are being harassed confront the problem directly . " Women allow themselves to become victims when they do n't take responsibility , ' argues Camille Paglia , author of " Sexual Personae , " the controversial critique of modern feminism . " If getting the guy to stop means putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't complain about it 10 years later . ' Yet most women simply feel uncomfortable with such responses . " Women have learned that confrontation is to be avoided , and they often do n't have the verbal tools to attack this kind of problem head-on as a man would , ' says Deborah Tannen , author of " You Just Do n't Understand : Women and Men in Conversation . ' <p> Fighting back is rarely as simple as telling the harasser to stop . Long Beach officer Browne-Allison initially tried to reason with the man who was her prime foe , but says that " he was really sarcastic  --  he just did n't want to hear it . ' Taking direct action can be compounded by feelings of self-doubt . When the West Coast manager was being harassed , she was paralyzed by the fear that she was being overly sensitive . " He had n't thrown me down on the couch and said that he 'd fire me if I did n't sleep with him , ' she says . The woman , who now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , has a fantasy . She imagines sending a newspaper story on the Clarence Thomas case to her old boss with an anonymous note : " Women hurt , even 10 years later .

These guidelines declare that unwelcome sexual advances , requests for sexual favors and other conduct of a sexual nature  --  verbal or physical  --  are considered illegal harassment when : an employee 's submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment ; an employee 's submission to or rejection of such conduct by another is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the worker 's status ; or the aggressor 's conduct unreasonably interferes with a worker 's job performance or creates an intimidating , hostile or offensive working environment . <p>
