HAWG HEAVEN ( FROM SPIKES ) BY MICHAEL GRIFFITH <p> When I met Rosa , my freshman year at Georgia , I was majoring in art history . Several things made " the technicolor slide " - as it was known-the perfect hideout for me academically . My mother had urged ( not far shy of exhorted ) me to go north ; she plied me with sweatshirts and a book called From the Kudzu to the Ivy , even pulled me out of school during the winter of my junior year for a trip to scout what she called , with dreamy pomposity , " the halls of higher learning . " As we slogged through soapy gray slush behind Alexander Hall at Princeton , she interrupted her sermon about the majesty of collegiate Gothic architecture . " What you 've got to do , " she said , tapping a hard-bitten fingernail against her forehead , " is devote your life to the apprehension of the beautiful . This is the place for it . This is the place . " She stamped a decisive foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; only my mother 's advice could sound so much like badly translated Latin . Next she 'd be telling me to be sure to strive ; striving is the thing to do : do n't leave excellence unstriven for . <p> But I had to recognize , as I let my eyes roam over the austere oaks , the salted flagstone walks , the somber and lovely stone of the dorms , how attracted I was by her vision . Here , among people smarter than me ( or was it I ? ) , among monuments to a history longer and larger than mine , I might find a life outside the bounds and binds of home , without expectations , without golf : a life of the mind . <p> But it was cold , after all . The slush invaded my clothes , my skin , and new granules stung my face every second or two . I wanted to find a warm place to eat , to split a beer with Mom , have a cigarette , listen to her enthuse : " Gosh , Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school in the South and the southernmost school in the North . In the War , they lost exactly as many students in butternut as in blue . How about that ? " At home she rarely drank , never smoked , but up East we were to be sophisticates , Ivy League material , not refugees from some Dixie cowtown . She wanted me to see , too , that this trip-and my impending " decision " - marked a passage into adulthood . I was a big boy now , my own man . at least until we crossed back into the South , into reality , into my father 's realm and purview . I knew , as we settled onto stools in a belowstreets tavern , that on our way home Mother would remind me that Some things are best kept to ourselves , and certain omissions , in a good cause , need n't count as deceit . ( Near Richmond , three days later , she said her piece . . . and then flipped the last of our cigarettes , along with a disposable lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it pleased me anyway to sit in a bar with her , smoking , nursing an English ale on draft - Mom having misled a shrugging waiter : " He 's my son , flesh of my flesh . You do n't think I know how old he is ? " - and listening to her prophesy how I would thrive in what she kept calling " a stimulating environ . " I knew we 'd go home eventually , knew this illusory " adulthood " would evaporate , knew my father and golf would loom up again . stake their old , their prior , claim . . . and my grades would n't have cut it , most likely , and anyway my parents ' little bit of money was tied up in my travel , equipment , entry fees . I 'd go to a school where I got a full ride , crip classes , and year-round sunshine . We were pretending , and Mom saw that as well as I did . But we sat there still , fingering the taffrail , spinning cardboard coasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equals . Is there anything lovelier than an amber ale in bar light , underground , amid brass and black wood and bric-a-brac , on a winter afternoon ? We knew it could n't last , but we averted our eyes from the truth , kept up our chatter : Omission , after all , need n't count as deciet . Not always . Not in Princeton . <p> So art history was the best balm available for Mom 's disappointment , and perfect for my purposes : high-toned but low-key , ether enough for her , gut enough for me . It had other advantages : what better place to apprehend beauty than a department where fourfifths of the students are women ? In what other skate major could I nap in class without having to battle the lights ? The college trip was a fading memory by then ; I was in Athens to play golf , not to learn . I had left that behind . It could wait , always had . <p> Golf had been my focus since I was seven , when my father sawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silver Scots ; their shafts were still warm to the touch when he steered me into the backyard to get me started on a short game . By the end of the next summer I was playing 45 holes every day and shooting under 40 a nine from the women 's tees . On my way , Dad told me , to something great . We 'd get there , he assured me ; he 'd have done it himself , if only he 'd been gifted with " the advantages you 've had . " I would swing the club , not a thought in my head , and he 'd take care of the rest : graphite drivers , smooth-bore irons , travel , coaching , thinking . Together , we 'd make it . <p> I became a very solid junior player , won a passel of state and regional events and a handful of national ones . I loved the winning from the beginning ( who does n't ? ) , and eventually the golf leached its way down into my soul , too , a creeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of their shoes at every shot , had to stand by and watch me knock three-woods stiff from 75 yards behind them , and they could n't take it . Trying to outdo me , they would flail at their wedge shots like woodcutters , lay a shroud of sod over their barely budged balls . The dreaded chili-dip . Having walked ahead , I stood on the edge of the green , putter against my scrawny leg , hands on my sawhorse hips ( making sure to point my thumbs to the front , like a pansy ) . I watched the fuming brutes fetch divots thick as their forearms , then kick them savagely back into place . I watched middle irons get buried up to their hosels in fairways ; I watched wedges windmill into ponds ; I heard curses of impossible virtuosity . No finesse , poor bastards . All the strength in the world , but no finesse at all . In defeat , their handshakes were always sweaty and limp , and their congratulations were inaudible . <p> Far from the greens-in itchy shrubbery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , in the bed of a construction-site dump truck-my father , his view of the action partially eclipsed , pumped his fist in the air where only I could see it . Later , in the car , we replayed my victories shot by shot , over and over . As we sped home past clapboard groceries and disemboweled stock cars and fields of broomsedge , the gold trophy I 'd won sitting in the backseat like a passenger , I was happy . My father mussed my hair ; the wind roared ; the trophy gleamed ; he let me work the gear shift . We were a team . . . as long as I kept up my end of the bargain , as long as I kept winning . <p> When I finished high school , the scholarship offers rolled in , though my scores had leveled off during my final two seasons . After trouncing the competition at the state championship as a freshman and again as a sophomore , I slipped to third-then , senior year , I shot a fat 80 the last day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I blamed my punchless play , not very nervously , on senioritis-by then I 'd signed a letter of intent . Nothing to worry about : the future was already written . <p> I chose the best golf situation I could find close enough to home for my father to see me play . Georgia had a solid tradition , good practice facilities , a well-organized , hands-off coach , a decent home track , and four graduating seniors ; if they happened to have a library equipped with books-and Mom assured me , trying to make the best of it , that they did-that was gravy as far as I was concerned . ( As for Mom : the only sign of discontent I could see was in the way her hopes for me had wilted . Grand aspirations ca n't take the climate down here , it seems . Too hot , too stupid : we do n't have amber ales or mind-clearing cold or collegiate Gothic , the prerequisites of respectability . " Be good , Brian , " she said , as I sat in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to college . I shifted into gear , set my foot on the brake : Get it over with , Mom . Tell me you love me . Tell me to excel . " Be good , " she repeated , almost sadly ; I edged forward . Tears were welling in her eyes , and I turned away to drive . I expected her , as she usually did , to rally at this last moment , to lift her head , wave briskly , and shout something about performing to my intellectual capabilities . Instead her voice grew soft , plaintive . " Play well , " she mumbled , and I went . ) <p> I 'd like to say I did n't date in high school because I was shy and afraid , did n't rebel out of a lack of imagination , did n't toke or snort or trip because I was sleepy and incurious ; and all that 's true , up to a point . Mostly , though , I was indifferent ; I was n't interested in people my age . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut a snug niche for me in the world ; we had poured my energies , my skills-all I had to offer-into golf . I had every assurance I needed : I was a winner . Coming down our street in the rain , you 'd pass a dozen houses , two dozen , without seeing a single car exposed to the elements ; but my father 's convertible dripped ostentatiously in the drive , displaced from the garage by my trophies . It was a sleek red billboard : Winner Lives Here . <p> Dad had enclosed the carport , installed backlit lucite cases , astroturf for bad-weather putting , a workbench for club repair-he 'd made a shrine to the idea that I was special , that I was immune from the world 's petty insults , its distractions , its ways of wearing one down . He kept the trophy room immaculate , the cases windexed , plaques polished , lights bright . One stormy day in junior high I decided to monkey around with a Crenshaw-style swinging-door putting stroke , so I sequestered myself in the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of newspaper in ragged rows and columns , were nearly a hundred of the miniature plastic drivers that crown trophies the way angels sit Christmas firs . I scanned the room , saw that every trophy 's clenched hands were empty , then looked back down at the drivers . Around each was a halo of gold touch-up paint : triumphs , my father believed , must not be permitted to dull . He 's a scary man . Had I been an adult , I might have pitied him . I 'm sure other parents on the junior circuit had a good chuckle at his obsessiveness , his on-course peculiarities ; maybe I was n't the only person to see my old man crouched in the forks of low trees , peeking from between giant heads of fountain grass . But I had no basis for comparison . He was my father ; he loved me ; he wanted my wins to stay golden . <p> So when I got to Georgia , I was convinced that my life had been laid out and that my destiny was simply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lucky enough to find , at an age when I needed it , a talent . My life was on the links : school was just the purgatory where I worked off the excesses of joy . I was naive : I suppose I assumed that everyone had a gift , a vessel into which to pour a life . I guessed everyone sleepwalked through the rest of it , the unworthy hours devoted to other things . Mediocrity did n't exist , so far as I knew : I had found something I did better than anyone else in the world . That would never change , and every person must have a similar skill , a preserve , a reason for living . It never occurred to me to question-Dad had told me a thousand times : Winners win . Losers think . <p> I arrived in Athens assuming I would put in my four years of golf , attending class , as always , as a counterweight to bliss . I would collect my All-America plaques , my NCAA Championship cups ; I 'd pass them wordlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he installed them in their allotted spaces in his garage . Then it would be on to the PGA , to wealth and stardom . <p> The team practiced on several courses around Athens , including one way out off Highway 129-a rough track called Cob 's Glynn . Cob 's attractiveness as a practice site had nothing to do with golf ; its bunkers were bottomed with gluey red clay , its greens were pocked with poa annua , billygoats grazed in pastures that abutted ( much too closely ) the fairways of the back nine , and in its layout there were all kinds of gimmicks : blind shots , hidden fingers of creek , old oaks in landing areas , even a greenside bunker in the shape of Georgia ( cut with all the punctilio you 'd expect from a speed freak on a backhoe ) . Cob 's was a dog-track ; but practice there was followed by a sojourn to Hawg Heaven , a legendary barbeque joint in the sticks . The proprietor was a huge booster of Georgia athletics , a bald fireplug named Seamus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him in his seat behind the Bulldog bench , jabbing the air with a whiskey flask , a red-and-black logo painted atop his pink pate . Mr. O'Lughnasaigh could be counted on to give all Bulldog athletes-even those who played lowly non-revenue sports like golf-free plates of Q , slaw , hash , and rice . <p> I 'd heard all about Hawg Heaven , and I was primed for the free meal after we played Cob 's early in my freshman fall . It was n't that I 'm a barbeque nut ( I do n't , truth be told , much like the peppered mustard-grease that passes for sauce in north Georgia ) . More than the food , what I was ready to dig into was the feeling I 'd hit the big time : rules were being finessed for me , risks run ( piddling risks , true , but risks all the same ) . At Hawg Heaven I would collect , on a wafer of styrofoam , the first modest perk of celebrity . I skipped lunch in preparation . <p> But things did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out to be a white cinderblock shack with the caved-in look of a mouth devoid of teeth . Dangling from the side of the building was a gnarled air conditioner ; the niche for the unit had been cut too big , and someone had stuffed the resulting space with oilrags and plastic grocery sacks and scraps of corkboard . The gray wreckage bore spray-painted swastikas , bullet holes ; its vents had been pinched like a pie crimped lovingly shut . It was covered on one side with bumps , swellings , nodules-an unreadable rash of braille that made it look like someone had tortured it , from inside , with a tack hammer . The window unit was one of those things so sublimely damaged , so dumbly ugly , that it had depths of expression : I felt for it , somehow . And despite the disfigurements it chugged away-the deafening suck drowned out all other sound . <p> On the wide front window , " Hawg Heaven " had been stenciled in silver script , and painted above was a bulbous cartoon pig complete with halo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The window was as broad as a service bay ; in fact , the restaurant looked very much like a superannuated filling station , dragged into the woods to live out its golden years in peace . The hot tang of barbeque sauce filled the air , strong enough to bring me to the verge of a sneeze . <p> We walked in . Hawg Heaven 's floor was cracked cement crammed with picnic tables set end to end . Checkered sheets of plastic had been fastened to the tables with an industrial stapler that hung on a hook beside the cash register ; iced-tea pitchers and loaves of white bread were spaced along the tabletops . Outdated calendarsNorman Rockwell , power tools wielded by women in bikinis , chimpanzees on toilets-lined the walls . Behind the counter , absently shooing flies away from the potato salad with a ladle , was a girl in a sauce-smeared apron . No Mr. O. No customers . It was only four o'clock . <p> I was near the back of our group , a freshman-I think there were probably 10 of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on my street shoes after I shed my spikes at Cob 's . We wore shorts , and our legs were deeply tanned , but our feet gleamed like bone . One of the ways we could be recognized by Mr. O'Lughnasaigh as golfers , I supposed , was the way we 'd track clay into Heaven on our pale , homely feet . <p> The first guy to the feed-trough was this asshole named Wass , our only senior . He was n't a good player-he 'd never made the traveling squad for a tournament-but as our grayest , loudest , brayingest veteran , he rated the front of the chow line . " Coach left me in charge , " Wass bellowed in the parking lot , " in his absence . Watch and learn , youngsters . " Forays into Hawg Heaven were the only benefit Wass got out of his affiliation with the team ; he was planning to take full advantage . I had played with him at Cob 's ( Coach believed in spreading the misery ; no one-especially no freshman-was exempt from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't spend the day bragging about how , in his spare time , he starred in porn movies under the name Iron Johnson , After every bad shot , instead of screeching about his ratshit luck or helicoptering clubs as was his habit , he 'd only rubbed his belly , smiled a rapturous smile , and said , " Good groceries comin ' , friends . Good groceries comin ' . " <p> Most of what Wass said was legitimately awful , but everything he said , even the rare innocent remark , was rendered a bit creepy by his aspect . He 'd had his eyebrows singed off in a lab accident in high school , and at some point , fueled by bourbon and vanity , he 'd hired a tattoo artist in Atlanta to draw him new ones . He 'd gone to a grimy parlor in Buck Head with a bottle of Jack Daniel 's to cut the pain and a dishrag to stifle his screams , conceiving of the operation as a sort of old-time waterfront-movie adventure . The result was grisly : too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quizzical arch . The new brows made him look like a cross between Lon Chaney and Divine . Wass was sensitive about his replacements , and he often wore a widebrimmed white plantation hat tugged down over them . <p> But he 'd doffed the lid when we came inside Hawg Heaven , in accordance with some quaint Christian custom his parents had taught him , a habit that ( unlike every moral tenet ) he 'd never quite gotten around to abandoning . The too-snug hatband had left a bright red track across his forehead , from brow to vaulted brow , and Wass looked scary . As he approached the counter , he fisted flat the crown of his massive overseer 's hat , then reinflated it with the fingers of his other hand . He faced up to the poor girl and growled , in about as friendly a tone as you ever heard from him , " Where 's Big O at , sweet ? " " Out . " <p> " Where out ? " <p> " Not here out . What can I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Wass 's forehead . His tone grew chilly . " Well , we 're the golfers , and we 're hungry . Dish us up some Bulldog specials , would you ? " <p> The girl pointed at a hand-lettered sign on the cash register , smiled wanly . " No shoes , " she read aloud , " no service . " She backtracked to the top . " Hawg Heaven regrets . " <p> Wass snorted . " Glad you did n't leave anything out , miss , " he said . " You know who we are ? " <p> The girl shrugged . " No , " she said . " But I know you do n't have shoes on . Sorry . " <p> " The Big O is gon ' be pissed if you do n't feed us , " Wass went on . The girl shrugged again , looked straight at his brows , and said , with no hint of sarcasm , " Gracious . Is that paint ? Are you maimed ? " Wass was too startled to be mad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What did you say ? " <p> The girl did n't back off . Her eyes never left those ghastly ink arcs , and her tone was all syrupy concern . " On your forehead . Where your eyebrows ought to be , " she said . " You look like you 've been vandalized . Do you need to use the phone ? " <p> I thought he was going to leap the counter . " Listen ! " Wass exploded . " We 're the Georgia golf team , and we can come in here buck goddamn naked if we want , and our food is free . You 're paid to keep your bitch mouth shut and sling hash . So sling . Now . " <p> The girl 's face clouded . She set her mouth . " I 'm sorry , " she told him . " You 'll have to take that up with Mr. O. I do n't know anything about free food for anyone . " <p> " Which is why I 'm telling you , " roared Wass . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was marvelous . Her hair was tied into a ponytail and looped through the back of her Hawg Heaven baseball cap . There was an orange daub of sauce under her ear , and tiny droplets of sweat stood out on her face . She was staring at Wass now in what looked to me like genuine bewilderment . Had n't he been in some sort of horrible accident ? Had n't she only been trying to help ? " No shoes , no service , " she repeated , firmly . " No exceptions . I could n't be sorrier . " Wass turned to his confederates , the other hangers-on of the team ; he shrugged his shoulders as if to ask whether frat-boy noblesse oblige had any hard and fast rules against killing barbeque girls who jeer your eyebrows and refuse you the tangy pork of your dreams . <p> There was a hush that must have lasted 15 seconds-during which the girl stood fast , Wass fumed and rocked threateningly , and the rest of us made an uneasy peace with our cowardices : what could I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pack ; Wass was bigger than me , older ; the girl was taking good care of herself . <p> Just when the silence was becoming unendurable , a candy-red Caddy barreled up the access road , kicking up spumes of dust , its horn blaring the Bulldog fight song . Seamus O'Lughnasaigh . <p> " Hold on a minute , Wass , " someone said , as though he had n't been . " It 's the Big O cavalry . " <p> Everybody except me turned to watch . I pressed forward until I was almost beside Wass . Who was this girl ? What was she up to ? I glanced around for clues . A stack of textbooks , the top one propped open with a yellow highlighter , lay on a card table next to the walk-in freezer . A student , then . A pair of gold sandals had been slung over a chair by their knotted anklestraps-I could see ( by leaning toward the plastic sneeze-shield ) that there were duckboard flats laid across the floor behind the counter for footing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greasy skids . Her ankles appeared slender , but I backed away , scared she 'd catch me appraising , before I could make a conclusive judgment . <p> The girl never looked at me , never budged , merely kept stirring the hash , two brisk swirls and then a solid clack of the ladle against the side of the metal bin , over and over again . Her rhythm was slow and perfect , reminded me of the solemn rumble of war drums in the movies : swirl , swirl , click ; swirl , swirl , click . I could see her facial muscles tense as the door chime sounded , and I wanted to help her . Laugh if you want . I thought she needed me . <p> Mr. O strode in , and golfers parted to let him through . I retreated . The boss man grinned and said , " Hey , fellas ! Welcome to Hawg Heaven , where the hogs is dead and the folks get fed . Who wants a little something to stick to his ribs and make his tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Wass , suddenly calm . <p> " Good to see you again , Mr. Wassink . How 's your grandpop ? " <p> Wass 's grandfather was a much-decorated general of the Vietnam war , a hero in these parts . . and the reason there was no getting rid of young Iron Johnson . Ironically , the general was famous for his formidable black brows . Those thick , fierce , unmoving lines could be counted on : fighting dragged on , body counts mounted , atrocities worsened , but Papa Wass 's twin tarantulas never wavered . Again and again they announced that U.S. policy was just and consistent ; her boys were fighting the good fight against those sly slopes and their Russian domino . Those brows were a bulwark amid the chaos ( I 'm borrowing , you might have guessed , from my mother 's testimony ) . Wass spoke up . " He 's fit and fine , Mr. O'Lughnasaigh . Sends his regards . But it gets to him sometimes : the country 's going to hell in a handbasket , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best resorts . Gooks fucking up the curve in math classes . " " Amen , " answered Mr. O. " Amen . " <p> Wass went on . " I 'm afraid we have a . . . situation here . This girl of yours says we ai n't welcome . I was sure she 'd got it wrong . " He grinned expectantly , raising his awful brows . His yes-men , all the upperclass hacks and squirrels , murmured their agreement . Wass kept pushing . " By the way , Big 0 , you got a complaint box ? This employee was rude to me . Hurt my feelings . Worse than that , she insulted our whole team-she insulted the U-niversity of Georgia . She treated us like a bunch of niggers . " He brandished his hat , a visual aid . <p> Seamus O'Lughnasaigh 's face darkened . " Is this true ? " he demanded , turning to the girl . Slowly , she sunk the ladle in the vat of hash . She looked up at her fearsome pink employer , tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd been girding herself for . I could tell she needed the job badly , could see her calculating what it was worth . She did n't answer the question . I looked around , but no one was showing any sign of stepping forward . Least of all me . Mr. O cleared his throat , and wattles swayed . " I asked you a question , sweetheart . Did you treat my guests with disrespect ? Do n't cry now . Just speak up . Did you treat these fine young men like nigras ? " <p> The girl stared at her feet , drowned the ladle one last time in the tub of hash , and through the sneeze-guard I could see her fingers snake around her back-she was going to untie her apron . No job could be worth putting up with these rednecks . No job could be worth occupying a stinking shack in the boonies , alone , fending off packs of barefoot peckerwoods with crayoned facial features . " No , " I broke in , and my voice surprised me ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . It was n't her fault . Wass was giving her a hard time . " The girl stared down at her red hands and started to wring them in her apron . I could n't tell whether she was pleased with me or annoyed . <p> Wass and his boys glared . " Fucking hotshot , " Wass muttered . " She would n't serve us , " he explained to our host . " She busted my chops in front of my friends . " <p> Now the girl spoke up . Her voice was soft but calm . " It was an accident , Mr. O'Lughnasaigh , I did n't mean to be impolite . He just kept insisting that he and his friends did n't have to pay . You never told me anything about that , and I was trying to stand up to him . I 'm the only one here . " <p> Mr. O shook his head and said , " That 's OK . That 's a good girl . " He turned back to Wass . " Sorry about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forgot to mention our little arrangement . . . which is why I dropped by . I hope you 'll accept our apology , Mr. Wassink . " He clapped Wass stoutly on the back and spoke over his shoulder to the counter-girl . " Are n't we sorry , Rosa ? " Let 's make nice ; he comes from powerful people . <p> She nodded miserably . " Hawg Heaven regrets , " she whispered . " Right , " echoed her boss . " Hawg Heaven regrets . " He began talking to Rosa now , but without looking at her . " These boys are fixing to kick some SEC ass this season , so let 's take good care of them , OK ? " Rosa nodded again . <p> " All right , then , " Mr. O announced , suddenly beaming . " All better . All better . " With that he spun and waddled back to his car , which he 'd left running ; when he swung open the front door , I could hear the Mills Brothers on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they crooned , " and crush it till the petals fall . " <p> Rosa began heaping food onto compartmented plates . Wass kept making her add a spoonful of this , a dollop of that , trying to humiliate her . His plate was overflowing when he tired of the game and slid over to the ice dispenser . " Thanks , darlin ' , " he said . " How about a hummer for dessert ? " <p> Wass 's friends kept the vitriol coming , unspeakable things , but Rosa bore it silently , with a terrible dignity . I felt rotten for her ; she must really need this crappy job . " Look , " said Wass as she started to dip out hash for me , " if it is n't Lancelot . Why do n't you two get it over with and fuck right now ? We 'll clear a spot on the grill . Sizzle , sizzle . " <p> " Shut up , Wass , " I said , searching for a clever retort , hoping indignation might supple up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds of strain , I settled : " You 're a big old turd , " I spat . " A big old turd . " To Rosa , I rolled my eyes . <p> " Thanks for sticking up for me , " she whispered . " I guess . " Her left eye , I noticed , was higher than her right , and she held her head at a tilt-adorably-to keep the world in alignment . " I 'm not sure this job was worth keeping . " " Better than nothing , " she said , " though you do get your share of freaks out here . " Rosa smiled , smacked the ladle against the side of the trough to clean it . We had already run out of things to say . She really was pretty . <p> " Could I have a little more slaw , please ? " I asked . " Sure . " <p> I groped for conversation . Nothing came . She kept piling food onto my plate-more slowly than before , it seemed , as though she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repartee . The well was dry ; I 'm not sure it had ever been wet . Golf was all I was good at . Finally I thought of another question . I mustered my courage , smiled my toothiest smile ; this was it . " Happen to have any sweet gherkins ? " I asked . <p> Rosa flashed her gorgeous , uneven teeth . To be bestowed a look like that , and just for asking , stammeringly , after pickles : it was a dream come true , it changed me . " In the back , " she said . " Hold on a sec . <p> She went to get them , and I began to rummage through my wallet for a tip . I 'd spotted a jar on the counter . All I had was a ten , but that seemed about right , all things considered , and I started stuffing it through the hole in the lid . I did n't want her to see me and think I was trying to buy her good will . But about the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affixed to the jar , of a young couple with bad teeth squatting in front of a cheap silver Christmas tree , the woman holding a squalling baby up to the camera like a caught fish .

( They are Christians ! ! ! ) " I was trying to extract the bill from the slot when Rosa returned . She stared at me , stealing from good churchgoing people with a gutted trailer and a colicky new kid . I twitched . " Umm , " I said , " I was trying ... . " <p> " I saw , " she answered , " and it was sweet , but they need it more than me . " She tamped the jar-lid with the butt of a fork-my fork , a gherkin speared on each of its three tines . The ten dropped to the bottom . Then she handed me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks a bunch . I really like pickles . " " I 'm glad , " said Rosa . " Anytime . " She gave the bin a valedictory clack , sent me on my way . <p> A few weeks later , when I spotted Rosa in the foyer after an art history class , I tapped her on the shoulder . Would she , uh , be averse , uh , to maybe going out with me sometime ? " Sure , " she said , in a tone of blandest unsurprise . She sorceled a datebook out of thin air ( or maybe pulled it out of her backpack ) , then uncapped a pen and looked straight into my face . " Say Friday afternoon . We 'll score a bottle of sweet pickles and find a nice place to eat them . Does that suit ? How about I pick you up at four . OK ? Where do you live ? " <p> Friday afternoon we laid out a gingham cloth in deep centerfield of the baseball stadium . Rosa was chattering away worrilessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was by sheer and inexplicable accident that we ended up here , on the matted sod of the outfield , battening blue-and-white corners with a menagerie of animal paperweights that Rosa produced from her bag-accident , too , that we had scaled a hurricane fence and climbed from the right-field bleachers onto the cinderblock wall and then dropped onto the field and were sitting , now , in the late sun , talking , amid the wreckage of our peculiar picnic-our jar of gherkins ( now seriously depleted ) , one of those rubber-gripper jar openers ( brought just in case and not , thanks to Rosa 's powerful fingers , needed ) , and a pair of cocktail forks , face up in the sun , still speckled with little green drops of brine . <p> Rosa kept her job at Hawg Heaven for another 10 months , until she found something better . The air conditioner kept up its chug , she claims , until the day she left . . . and though I 'm not sure I believe her , I want to , which is near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irremovable orange ring around her fingernails , and we fell in love . <p>
