In today 's Information Society , we prize those who can skillfully manipulate data .... Headnote . . . In tomorrow 's Dream Society , we will most generously reward those who can tell stories . // The Information Age , which opened only a few decades ago with the appearance of the first commercial computers , is already approaching its end . In the years ahead , we will move into what may be called the Dream Society . The future Dream Society will be the fifth techno-economic system in which humans have lived . The first-the Hunter-Gatherer Societygave way to Agricultural Society about 10,000 years ago . Agricultural Society began yielding to a third system-Industrial Society-about 1750 , when steam engines began appearing in England . About 1950 , a fourth system-the Information Society-began to take shape , but it now appears that the Information Society will not last more than a few decades longer before yielding to a society focused on dreams , adventure , spirituality , and feelings . When our future grandchildren look back on our age , they will see it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values . They will understand that we today could not yet free ourselves from our narrow focus on work , which we viewed simply as a means to pay for consumable goods and leisure pursuits . They may , however , wonder what it was like to live at a time when life was divided into little boxes of either work or leisure . They will also think of us today as being poor . Historically , the production of material wealth has increased at the rate of about 20% to 25% per decade , and this trend must be expected to continue . This implies that our grandchildren will likely consume twice as much as we do . The huge increase in material wealth owes much to science and technology , but , in the future , attention will turn away from science toward nonmaterialistic and nonscientific values . The highest-paid person in the first half of the next century will be the " storyteller . " The value of products will depend on the story they tell . Nike and many other global companies are already mainly storytellers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy sessions are increasingly about storytelling-not manufacturing . Our heroes at the Olympic Games in Atlanta will be those telling magnificent stories-and they 'll be getting well paid later . The technologies allowing global communication-the Internet , direct broadcast satellites , etc. - will be taken for granted , and much more value will be placed on the content of that communication . For example , 500 television channels offering nothing but reruns of old shows will not be tolerated-people who can produce highly imaginative new programs will be in greater demand , as will innovative CD-ROM creators , musicians and composers , actors , artists , journalists , and other storytellers . Just as information manipulation is a valued skill in so many occupations today , storytelling will be a key skill in a wide range of professions , from advertiser to teacher to business entrepreneur to politician to religious leader-even to futurists . Each will be valued for his or her ability to produce " dreams " for public consumption . Two Key Trends Two trends in today 's society are particularly important in the transformation ahead : The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial tasks have been automated , clerical work such as typing letters , entering data , and adding and subtracting sums has been increasingly turned over to machines , such as computers , photocopiers , and telephoneanswering machines . Now professional expertise-the tasks of lawyers , doctors , and engineers-is being turned over to artificial intelligence . Human senses are also being automated , so that electronic devices can hear , see , and feel , thus further reducing the need for human workers in traditional jobs . Electronic sensors now can detect toxic fumes in factories , motion detectors spot burglars , and answering machines hear as well as speak . We still need human experts to supervise and be available , just as we want a pilot on our airplane even if the plane is automated . But the role of the human worker will be increasingly limited to being present for the unexpected and to " comfort the passengers . " As " soft " knowledge , such as courtesy and manners , is automated over the next quarter century , routine functions of all kinds will disappear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You will order by computer , and your food will be prepared and delivered into your hands by robots . Computers will also serve you in retail stores , in banks , and at airport ticket counters . Humans will be needed only to make changes in the automated systems . The second key trend is the commercialization of emotions . It will no longer be enough to produce a useful product : A story or legend must be built into it , a story that embodies values beyond utility . This imperative is already occurring with more and more products : People buy blue jeans , for instance , only partly to cover their bodies ; most of the money they pay is for the story that goes with the product-a story of independence , youth , power , and perhaps traditional ( or nontraditional ) values . Similarly , when they buy eggs laid by free-range hens , much of the money they pay is for the hen 's lifestyle . People pay because they value animal life , nature , and tradition . Photograph // People have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs . What is happening now is that the story that shapes our feelings about a product has become an enormous part of what we buy when we buy the product . So business firms have reached a new frontierthe realm of imagination , emotions , and dreams . This new frontier is no longer limited to the entertainment industry , with its theme parks and video games , but is also claiming practical , everyday products , which now come with built-in stories and emotions . Today , people still buy products mostly for their function ; nonmaterialistic reasons remain secondary . But that is changing . In 25 years , what people buy will be mostly stories , legends , emotion , and lifestyle . Poverty will be redefined as the inability to satisfy more than one 's material needs . In the future , people 's focus will shift from material to spiritual needs , from technology and science to emotions and storytelling . When buying a computer , for example , you will pay comparatively little attention to its functionality , which you will take for granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the story that goes with it . As a result , new jobs will appear in the creation and distribution of feelings . For example , sensory designers will use colors , scents , and textures to create environments that stimulate certain emotions ; " strategic dreamers " will help corporations understand the spiritual goals of potential customers , employees , and stockholders ; idea-generation studio operators will offer relaxing places for people to daydream , either for pleasure or to solve troubling problems . Life in the Dream Society Here are some ideas about what life will be like in the Dream Society : The landscape will look more as it did at the beginning of this century . Cows , pigs , hens , and horses will again be out on the countryside . They will have a " decent " animal life , as recommended by animalrights activists . Ecological principles and animal rights will be accepted everywhere . Forests will have been replanted , and wildlife will be returning to its pre-Industrial Age status . Nature may be worshiped as holy , with a reverence greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have rediscovered his place as being within nature rather than above it . The green movement will have triumphed , not because of any scientific necessity , but because of changing values in the affluent regions of the world . Values , not science , will rule . Work will turn into play . Before the Industrial Age , work and leisure were not viewed as separate spheres . But , with the need for industrial discipline , a work ethic developed ; work acquired a darker , heavier character , with a suggestion that one must suffer while working . Work became viewed as simply a means toward a goal , and the more one suffered , the more one deserved to be rewarded . Work will be different in the future . In two or three decades , only a small percentage of the population will be employed in industry , which will then be almost completely automated . The typical work situation will be in an office , where you sit at a desk and talk with your computer . ( Voice recognition will make writing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely nonmaterialistic : It could be news , education , design , knowledge , scientific data , or perhaps management . Photograph // For the worker , work will be play . If you watch small children , you see that their play is serious : They identify strongly with what they do . In the future , the notion that work should be no more than a means of obtaining something else will disappear . People will , of course , be paid for working , but money will not be the main reason for working . Discipline will lessen because the production of stories will not require it . What will be required is total dedication to the task . In the more-affluent societies , efficiency will not be considered tremendously important ; feelings and values will be what counts . Today 's business firm is rational , efficient , and devoted to making profits , because it developed out of the Industrial Age and the Information Age . But this type of company will either adapt or disappear in the future . What a Dream Society requires is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with efficiency and working only for profit will be regarded as untrustworthy . Before the Industrial Age , companies sought to earn a profit but had other goals , typically religious . The Industrial Age has been a cold , sterile period of worshiping science and material well-being . These obsessions have continued in the Information Age , but in the Dream Society , companies will be more balanced : They will seek to earn a profit , but they will also want to achieve certain human values , for example , kindness to animals , fairness to all , or happiness for workers and their communities . The idea that work might become play and companies might stress human values more than profits is not new . Already , many business leaders claim that they are working for fun , and companies talk about their ethics and core values , so the vague outline of the future Dream Society may already be seen . The Home of 2020 In the year 2020 , wealth will be 60% higher than today . Goods produced with labor-intensive methods will still be expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even free . Vacuum cleaners will be cheap but servants so expensive that only billionaires will be able to afford them . The home of the future may resemble a royal palace in that it will have many servants . But the servants will be electronic . Already , television gives each home the equivalent of a court jester . In 2020 , your personal court jester will have a better sense of humor ; it will respond to you and even laugh at your jokes . In the amusement room , your children may play virtual-reality games , which will allow them to fight violent battles or explore the outer regions of space . Every home will have the equivalent of a theme park . Photograph Photograph // There may be an information room where you can learn , teach , and communicate . The information room would develop from today 's home office . In the information room , any conceivable piece of information will be yours for the asking , and you will be able to get in touch with anybody , anytime , anywhere . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting electronic companions for you . Today 's home is designed to provide privacy , with the castle as its basic model . But , as new communications invade the home , people may seek new retreats , such as boats . However , people already accept that information technologies have taken away much of their privacy , and many will grow tired of living in isolated electronic fortresses . As a consequence , they may often head out to restaurants and malls to seek the company of others . The shopping mall of the future will become a place for relaxation and partying as well as an exhibit center and marketplace . Dream Products Today 's products are mainly designed for rational purposes-to meet physical needs , to increase comfort , or to save time . In the future , products will be designed to meet spiritual and emotional goals . Such products will serve : The market for thrills and excitement , including the market for violence . Some of today 's products already serve this market , though we do not yet fully admit it . We still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though it may simply be to provide amusement . The market for solitude and meditation , for quiet . This market is probably already huge because most people now live in cities , but the demand for these qualities will be met in a more open way , in spiritual rather than materialistic terms . The market for personal identity-signals about oneself . Even today , automobiles may be less a means of transportation than a symbol of a person 's lifestyle and dreams . In 25 years , it will become even more obvious that people buy cars to symbolize their lifestyles . Thus the car of the future will not become more rational , practical , and efficient , but quite the contrary : It will mainly express a person 's dreams . The ability of a car to take you from point A to point B will be subordinate to its symbolic character . The market for understanding life . Man has always wanted to know why he exists and what comes after his existence . Religion , work , art , and science have offered answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market to grow because more people will have time to think about such issues . A Revival of Local Cultures ? In the year 2020 , many regions of the world will still be relatively poor compared with the developed nations . The difference in wealth may be just as great as it is today , but the key question is whether the developing countries will see themselves mainly as poor or as simply different . At the moment , western culture is gaining ground in many countries , due to the global dissemination of information . In 50 years , this could result in a global monoculture , with a world market for the same products , music , entertainment , and fashion . Many cultures and philosophies would disappear . Photograph // The other possibility is a global revival of cultures , with each tribe rediscovering its roots . Just as we today are trying to preserve biodiversity , we may decide someday to preserve cultural diversity . If so , cultural diversity may become more important than a nation 's gross national product . Accountants will work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its values will hold the highest importance for you . Issues that deal with cultural attributes will take top priority . People will not be concerned about whether one culture is " better " or " worse " than another ; the important thing will be to preserve the difference . The Long View Is Needed Today Back in 1900 , it was relatively easy to predict the American future for the first few decades , though by 1950 , the forecasts would be going awry due to the coming of the Information Age . Similarly , today , we can anticipate some features of the society of the twenty-first century . We can already see the beginnings of another transformation . The seedlings of the Dream Society may be glimpsed in such developments as the election of an actor as president of the United States and a playwright as president of the Czech Republic . In the decades ahead , the seedlings will become mighty Sequoias . Sidebar From the Land of Storytellers It is indeed appropriate that this forecast for a future that values stories and dreams comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Isak Dinesen ( Baroness Karen Blixen ) - author of Winter 's Tales and Out of Africaand Hans Christian Andersen author of numerous fairy tales such as " The Emperor 's New Clothes , " " The Ugly Duckling , " and " The Little Mermaid . " In the future , concludes Jensen , we will all be storytellers in whatever profession we choose , whether teacher or politician , athlete or painter , historian or futurist .
