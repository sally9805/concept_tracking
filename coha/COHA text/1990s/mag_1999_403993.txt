WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH , THE TOUGH TAKE A REST // Recovery is one aspect of training we 've all mastered . It involves watching Caddyshack , poking the remote control and eating potted meat or any other inert object on the kitchen shelf . Nothin ' to it , right ? Well , turns out there 's actually a technique to proper recovery , and getting it right is fundamental to effective training . Frequent BICYCLING contributor Edmund Burke , Ph.D. , demystifies the process in his new book , Optimal Muscle Recovery . He argues that anyone can train hard , but real improvement comes from carefully balancing recovery and hard effort . In fact , proper recovery will benefit performance in everything from tours to stage races . We talked to Burke about his views , and his new book . Why did you write this book ? Cyclists often ask me how to recover , which is the ability to get back to peak strength in a short time . The question comes not just from racers hammering every day during stage races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIDS Rides or the MS 150 . I looked at all the new research on what causes fatigue and improves recovery , and found it goes far beyond just nutrition . The result was the R4 plan . What 's the R4 plan ? R4 is a slogan to help riders remember the key points : restore , replenish , reduce and rebuild . The book is an attempt to get this new thinking out there to fitness riders and racers . What 's new about the R4 plan ? How does it differ from the traditional prescription of eating carbs and hydrating ? There 's more to recovery than water and carbohydrates . The academic community has had a paradigm shift in the last few years . They 're beginning to recognize the importance of protein to help rebuild muscle cells damaged by exercise and rebuild the immune system . Also , antioxidants like vitamins C , E and beta carotene fight the cell damage caused by intense exercise . Here 's Burke 's recovery program . As a starting point , it assumes you 've just done a fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes that has depleted the glycogen supply in your legs . Restore fluids and electrolytes * You can start the recovery process even before the ride begins by drinking as much as 12 ounces of a sports drink 15 minutes prior . Then consume 4-8 oz every 10-15 minutes during the ride . * Consume electrolytes ( sodium , potassium and magnesium ) . Find a sports drink containing at least 40 milligrams of sodium per 8 oz of fluid , or add extra salt to food . Replenish glycogen stores rapidly * In the two hours after exercise , a 150pound cyclist should eat 68-102 grams of carbohydrate ( which is converted to glycogen for use by the muscles ) , with some protein . Energy bars contain about 45 grams of carbos. * Protein in sports drinks makes glycogen replenishment more effective , but too much protein slows stomach emptying-not good during exercise . The best ratio of carbohydrate to protein is four to one , so check the nutritional labeling on any sports drink you 're considering . * In the 24 hours following exercise , eat about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 150-pound rider should consume about 750 grams . ) Incidentally , your daily diet should contain 60-65% carbohydrate , 20-25% fat and 15% protein . Reduce cellular damage and muscle stress * Eat 8-10 servings of fruits and vegetables every day to support the immune system . Citrus fruits provide vitamin C ; dark green vegetables such as spinach and broccoli supply beta carotene ; and wheat germ , nuts and sweet potatoes are a good source of vitamin E. * Supplement these foods with a multivitamin. // The R4 Plan : Quick Way to Recovery // Rebuild muscle protein * Protein consumption above the Recommended Daily Allowance ( RDA ) is controversial . Some research indicates that athletes get enough protein from a conventional diet , while other studies suggest that high-intensity exercise requires twice the RDA of four grams per 10 pounds of bodyweight . Burke favors additional protein ( up to twice the RDA ) , in the form of food or supplements , if you 're training intensely or riding every day during a demanding tour .
