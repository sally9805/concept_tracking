<p> LES EYZIES , France  --  Moses Meredith is sauntering back from a swim in the brisk Dordogne River when he freezes in his tracks . <p> Just a few feet away sits the most glorious sandwich  --  fresh ham and brie nestled in a warm baguette . He has no choice . <p> With a single pounce , the 4-year-old yellow Lab steals the meal from bemused owner Susan Meredith and runs away , tail wagging . Can a dog 's life get more deliciously decadent ? <p> A growing number of the USA 's 55 million dog owners are expanding the definition of traveling with their pets . Some are like a quartet of northern Californians who are making this journey with their four-legged friends through picturesque south-central France on Europeds ' inaugural Dordogne Doggie Walk . <p> By the end of the week-long trip with the Monterey , Calif. - based tour agency , the verdict sounds like this : <p> Radar : Woof ! <p> Torey : Woof ! <p> Moses : Woof ! <p> Rocket : Grrrr . . . . But more on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly natural , I just wish we could do this back home , " says retired banker and 1952 Olympian ( backstroke ) Barbara Jordan , 60 , with champion Jack Russell terrier Rocket . <p> She 's joined by two Piedmont , Calif. , friends : state medical investigator Karen Fetherston , 50 ( with veteran European traveler Torey , a schipperke ) , and Brooks Brothers exec Ken Shaw , 69 ( with a mutt named Radar , found in the rubble after the 1989 San Francisco earthquake ) . <p> The fourth comrade is Meredith , 49 , a nutritionist from Pacific Grove , Calif. ( with the rambunctious and thieving Moses ) . All four vacationers are divorced and revel in the company of their pooches . <p> " Some people told me it was cruel to put my dog on a plane for 10 hours , " Meredith says . " But making the trip was so much easier than I imagined . And once here , I found it was a great way to meet people who normally would n't talk to someone traveling alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in walking and cycling tours of Europe , the Dordogne Doggie Walk is a no-brainer . <p> " An old trip is new again when you go with your pet , " says guide Bruce Austin , part owner of Europeds . " All three women on this trip had been to Europe , but they 've come back again because of their dogs . " <p> Customers had hinted that they wanted to go abroad with their pets , Austin says . They 're most likely the same people responsible for a recent growth in books and newsletters aimed at those who would take the animals on the road . <p> " People are retiring younger and living longer , and for some of them , their dogs are their kids , " says Wendy Ballard , publisher of Doggone newsletter , based in Vero Beach , Fla. ( six issues , $ 24 ; 561-569-8434 ) . <p> With a few exceptions , such as Boston 's Four Seasons and the Westbury in New York , most of the 26,000 U.S. hotels that Ballard says welcome pets are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not the case here in France , which happily went to the dogs centuries ago . <p> This is a country where man 's best friend is treated like man 's best friend  --  or better . That means dogs are allowed just about anywhere , in shops , on trains , in most every hotel  --  even the very best . <p> And , of course , in restaurants , where most tourists first get a glimpse of what a dog 's life is like here . Humans and beasts coexist on almost equal footing , which is why France is so appealing to Europeds ' group of upscale travelers . <p> Not much can beat walking through a landscape worthy of an impressionist painting , a trip mixing leisure and education . <p> Each day 's core consists of a 4-mile walk along France 's network of G.R. routes , or grande randonnee ( grand circuit ) . A van is used to carry gear and ferry folks longer distances . The trails , mostly gravel or grassy farm roads with the occasional asphalt stretch , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by French hiking clubs . <p> On this foundation are laid three thematic icings : art , history and prehistory . <p> One day involves hiking near the villages of Pechboutier and Carmensac to visit the rural studios of respected expatriate artists , including Dutch engraver Mi Desmedt and Irish watercolorist Guy Weir . <p> Many medieval castles are scattered throughout the region , testaments to the Hundred Years ' War , which was fought between France and England into the 15th century for control of this lush region , then known as Aquitaine . Of particular note is Les Milandes , the chateau once owned by famed nightclub singer Josephine Baker . <p> Stops at Font-de-Gaume and Lascaux , both repositories of the world 's most pristine examples of cave art done some 50,000 years ago , are supplemented by a visit to the Roque Saint-Christophe , a giant natural gash in a cliff that has welcomed human inhabitants for tens of thousands of years . <p> With the exception of the cave drawings , the dogs see and do everything their owners do  --  from taking in the splendor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walnut trees ( in the fall , walnuts pop up in all recipes ) , drying tobacco ( the region is a big producer ) and squawking ducks ( Dordogne foie gras is legendary ) . <p> Canine personalities come to the fore . Torey and Radar are by far the best behaved , practically disappearing during three-hour dinners , content to doze on cool tile floors . <p> Moses spends a good deal of time on his leash , as some of his pastimes include rolling in cow manure and , his favorite , eating anything in sight , including farm-fresh salami sandwiches and , in one instance , an entire ball of cheese . <p> And then there 's Rocket . His owner says the hit TV show Frasier does a disservice to Jack Russell terriers by portraying them as apartment animals . She 's right . <p> Rocket never runs out of fuel . He literally pulls Jordan around Dordogne , getting practically airborne if any form of animal or fowl crosses his path . <p> While the other three dogs are eager to meet ( sniff ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog he likes . When the local chiens amble around to say hello , the pooch is all teeth and grrrrr-owls . <p> Does that mean he did n't enjoy his first visit to France ? Of course he did . For where else can a dog raise the roof and be met with the French equivalent of " Oh , but how cute ! " <p> Europeds ' @x Dordogne Doggie Walk will be repeated four times next year : twice in July and twice in the fall . Cost : $ 2,200 per person , which includes first-class lodging as well as breakfast and dinner daily ; airfare is extra . Tours are limited to six dogs and their owners .

Europeds , for example , not only organizes the trip at a reduced cost but also provides knowledgeable guides to the region and offers support should anything happen to you or your pet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intimate adventure , with just you and your best friend meandering around Dordogne without a timetable , it can be done . <p> GETTING THERE : Fly into Paris or Bordeaux and take the train to the Dordogne region . Keep in mind that most airlines charge around $ 100 for your pet to join you . Early summer ( June ) and fall ( September ) are the most popular times to visit ; many hotels close for the winter season in mid-October . <p> LODGING : It 's always a good idea to phone ahead to make sure the hotel in question will accept animals . Most will , although some charge daily fees . Europeds used three upscale properties on its Doggie Walk .
