They did n't meet at their usual hangout , but why should they ? They had an errand to run . They met at a small place on Toldbodgade , one flight up ; its dim lighting was perfect . <p> Barney got there first . He sat with his back to the door and had his hand clamped around a bottle of Carlsberg ' s strong Gold Beer when Bent walked in . His clamped hand and his quietness , man , that did n't quite fit him : a whole new Barney . <p> Bent tried a sudden shout from behind . Barney cringed instantly inside his denim jacket . <p> " Something buggin ' you ? " Bent asked , laughing . <p> Barney screwed up his eyes and put the bottle to his lips . He did n't like it . <p> " I 've packed a few things , " Bent said in order to get a grasp on the situation . <p> " That 's your problem , " Barney replied and took another swig . <p> " You do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Do n't need ' em , " said Barney . <p> Bent sat down and looked around the bar . It was not a place for normal people : too many Swedes and intellectuals . <p> Barney ordered two more Gold Beers . He did n't ask Bent about anything ; his face loomed from the other side of the table . All he did was open his mouth , and the words " Two Gold Beers " came out , and even though he did n't say it very loud , they were placed on the table a moment later . <p> " Drink , " Barney said . <p> " Take it easy , " said Bent . <p> " It 's on me , " said Barney . <p> " That 's a different story , " Bent replied . <p> He watched Barney as he downed the beer . Barney did n't look at him . He did n't look at anything else in the bar . His eyes just hung glued to the air . A special way of staring , even for Barney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We should 've planned to meet somewhere else , " Bent said . He did n't get far with this sentence either . <p> Bent finished his beer and ordered two more . <p> " My turn , " he said , but got no response from the other side of the table . <p> Barney stared like a car with its headlights canted up in the darkness , shining but without anything to shine on . A total waste . <p> " I met Ulla , with the ass , " Bent said . " Good-humored and sweet-smelling . " <p> No beer arrived at the table . Nothing happened at all . The bar was completely quiet . Man , maybe you should put your coat on and leave . <p> " I wish they had a pool table here , " Bent said . <p> Barney looked at him . <p> " Pool , " Bent repeated and laughed . <p> " No comment , " Barney answered without moving a single muscle in his face . <p> The beer 's taste went bad in Bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table in front of him . He had n't even heard them touching the tabletop . <p> Bent picked up his plastic bag and rummaged through it a little . He positioned the bicycle chain and the electric wire at the top , then stuck the whole thing in Barney 's face . He made sure that the bag 's opening faced him . <p> Barney did n't trouble himself to look . Only straight ahead , darkly . <p> " Here 's the stuff , " Bent said . <p> Barney glanced into the bag . <p> " Piss , " he said . <p> Bent pulled the bag away , put it down between his feet , and then drank from his bottle . Barney watched him as he put it down on the table . <p> " Nervous ? " Barney asked slowly , drawing it out as long as a whole sentence . <p> " Me ? " said Bent , " Me , nervous ? " " You 're fucking nervous , " Barney replied , " I could see it on you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous . " <p> " You were sitting with your back to the door , man , " Bent replied . <p> " Shut up , " Barney answered . <p> " At least I 've packed some goddamn stuff , " Bent said , " You have n't packed anything . " <p> " I 've got it right here , " Barney answered , and stuck his fists up in front of Bent 's face , " They 're registered . " <p> Bent stared at the fingers , white from being clenched . He felt faint for a moment , or something that resembled faintness . <p> " So are we outta here ? " Barney asked . <p> " Right now ? " said Bent . <p> " Are we gon na catch that fucking ship ? " Barney asked and got up . <p> Bent finished his beer and laid down the money . He did n't count it : it was n't the kind of place where you had to be exact . <p> Barney was already walking down Toldbodgade . He walked with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were falling-down drunk , yet neither was true . <p> The plastic bag slapped Bent 's thigh . The street was utterly dark , darker than it needs to be at this time of the year in the middle of the city . In one way or another the darkness seemed to impede him while he strained to catch up to Barney . <p> After rounding the corner , the ferry to Bornholm stretched out right in front of them , looking endless in the dark , like a fallen skyscraper . <p> They sat in the ship 's cafeteria with their backs to the wall . <p> Bent turned to watch as the ferry sailed out of the harbor . Barney did n't want to see any of it . <p> " This ai n't no luxury cruise , " Barney said , " We 're just getting from one place to another . " <p> " I 'll get a couple of Gold Beers , " said Bent . <p> " No Golds during the crossing , " said Barney , and his voice showed he meant it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drummed his fingers . <p> " Shut up , " said Barney , " That 's Torben 's line . " <p> Bent sniffed . He walked over and bought four regular beers . <p> Bent managed to open up three and drink them before Barney finished up the fourth for himself . <p> The ship started rolling . <p> " Let 's take a walk through the lounge , " said Barney . <p> " I do n't want to sleep , " replied Bent . <p> " We 'll just watch them while they 're lying down , " said Barney . <p> " Who ? " asked Bent . <p> " Everybody else , " Barney answered slowly , " The other people . Who else ? " <p> They wandered through the lounge . It was dark or almost dark . The others were lying on some kind of upholstered bunks , some were whispering . It was a strange sound blended with the sea , man , you could n't figure it out . <p> Then Barney stopped . He leaned over someone Iying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Barney let his face sink down toward hers . He almost managed to touch her before she shouted . <p> Bent backed into the shadows . Barney remained standing over the girl . Bent did n't know how he could stay so calm . <p> " I thought you were somebody else , " said Barney . He almost sounded friendly . <p> The girl turned her face away . <p> A moment later , Bent saw Barney stroke the girl 's hair . He was n't sure . He both saw it and he did n't . The light from the glass doors seemed glaring in the darkness . <p> " I 'm getting out of here , " Bent whispered , but he did n't move an inch . <p> Barney stood completely still and waited , even though the ship was rolling . Suddenly he stuck his hand underneath the blanket covering the girl 's body . <p> Bent stared , the girl did n't say anything , the light moved , time passed and nothing happened . He could n't tell whether the blanket was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left . Bent followed . They sat at the table back in the cafeteria . <p> " Want a beer ? " asked Bent . <p> " It 's closed , " Barney replied . <p> " The bar 's still open for another ten minutes , " said Bent . He did n't know whether the bar was open , but it helped him to say it . <p> Suddenly Barney stuck his hand in Bent 's face . <p> " Smell , " he said . <p> " What 's the matter , man ? " shouted Bent . <p> " Pussy , " Barney answered . <p> " That 's a lie , " said Bent . <p> " She was stark naked underneath the blanket , " Barney said and pulled back his hand as if it were too good for Bent . <p> " I 'll get the beer , " Bent said . <p> When he returned from the restaurant , Barney was sitting holding his hand in front of his nose , laughing . <p> Bent slammed the bottles down in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bent said . <p> " Another time , on this same ferry , " said Barney , " We were lying out on the deck , it was just starting to get light during the summer . She was Norwegian , and all of a sudden she was sitting on top of me . She was little and wet . Man , she was drunk . She got it three times before we got to Ronne . " <p> " You 've never even been on Bornholm before , " said Bent . <p> " I did n't even know her , " Barney said . " Neither one of us said a word , not before or after . Never even knew her name . " <p> " You 've never been on goddamn Bornholm before , " Bent repeated . <p> " Been to Dueodde , " said Barney . " Dunes , lighthouse , Dueodde as far as you can see . " <p> " Tejn , " Bent replied . <p> Barney looked at him . Then he smiled and pulled a piece of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bent saw it upside down . " Tejn " was written at the top of the paper . <p> " Open the beer , " Barney said . " I 'm getting ready . " <p> Bent uncapped the beers and started drinking . He eyed Barney , who was turning the paper every which way as if it were a puzzle or a secret code . Suddenly he pointed his finger at an X a little ways from the coast , outside Tejn . <p> " There , " Barney said , " Seven grand . Torben told me . " <p> Bent looked at the finger , and , even though he tried to imagine the money , he kept seeing the blond covered by the blanket , the cunt in the dark , Barney 's fingers . It was all clear and detached . It was like a picture . <p> " Man , " Bent gasped . <p> " Seven thousand , " Barney repeated , squinting his eyes . <p> " Money does n't smell , " Bent said , repeating a phrase he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to side . People were lying all around them , none of them aware of the trip 's purpose . None of the others had any idea . They were just lying there , resting their heads on their backpacks , eyes shut , rocking gently with the ship . They were going nowhere , were young in a stupid sort of way . Totally irrelevant , no longer of any importance . Only Barney and Bent had a mission . <p> Bent suddenly fell asleep with his head on the table . A little before five o'clock in the morning , one of the beer bottles tipped over , hitting him on the right ear , waking him . <p> Standing in front of the bus station by the ferry harbor . It was n't light yet . A slight odor of fish , tar , and the sea hung in the air , tangy with the cold . Bent knew it : we 're out in the boonies  --  Ronne . <p> Barney looked at the paper , which had gotten crumpled in his pocket . <p> " Route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out two sausage rolls from the plastic bag and gave one to Barney . Barney examined it before stuffing it in his mouth . <p> " Forty minutes , " said Barney through the bread , " Forty minutes till Tejn . " <p> " Will it be light before we get there ? " Bent asked . <p> Barney looked at him . He spit out the remaining bread . <p> " You 're scared , man , " he said . <p> " No , " Bent answered . <p> They took seats in the bus , and Barney crossed his legs and jiggled one foot . A family came down the aisle and hit Barney 's foot . But afterwards it kept on jiggling , constantly moving , as if measuring the minutes until the bus left . Man , that leg had no peace . <p> " There she goes , " Bent said suddenly and pointed at a girl with blond hair . <p> " Big deal , " Barney said without even turning his head . <p> Bent watched her disappear into a bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> " Route 4 what ? " Barney asked . <p> " She 's taking Route 4 , " Bent said . <p> " You think I give a shit ? " Barney asked . <p> As the bus started moving , Bent felt that the ship had pitched and rolled all night long , when suddenly it dawned on him that it was really the bus that was rolling and the ship that had been calm . He shut his eyes . <p> " Forty minutes to Tejn , " Barney said . <p> Just then , the horizon started glowing at the edges . Bent leaned and put his forehead against the window . The pane was cold , his nausea sank down and away through his body , and he calmed down . <p> Barney suddenly stopped jiggling his foot . He fished through the pockets of his denim jacket and found a smoke and lit it . <p> An old lady behind him tapped his shoulder and asked him whether he could n't wait a little to smoke . Barney did n't move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klemensker , " the lady said . <p> " Have a good trip , " Barney said and blew smoke up under the bus ceiling . <p> The lady mumbled something about Copenhageners . <p> Barney waited a moment , then turned and put the cigarette out in the ashtray in front of her , so that ashes fell onto the lady 's coat . She gave a little cry and afterward was silent . <p> Bent looked down into the plastic bag , had a look at the stuff  --  he was in control of everything  --  but made sure that Barney did n't see it . Barney was preoccupied with the old lady 's silence . <p> The bus stopped and started , stopped and started , the glow in the eastern sky was intensifying . Bent supposed they called it the morning sky out here in the sticks . <p> Then the boulders appeared , jutting out of the ground as if they had just burst through the crust , unexpected , large , solid , damp , and dark . <p> " Boulders , " Bent said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't heard it . There were boulders in any case , and the glow in the sky was becoming more intense . <p> " We 'll go to a grocery store and get beer , " Barney said . <p> " Gold ? " asked Bent . <p> Barney sat for a while , then turned to face Bent . <p> " Gold , " he answered . <p> " They 're on me , " Bent said . <p> Barney nodded and looked out the window . He did n't comment on the boulders . Bent was convinced that Barney had never been on Bornholm before . <p> When the sea came into view , Bent became uneasy . It was located in a totally different direction than what he had expected . The waves were rolling right at the boulders , " the surf ' they called it . The bus turned parallel to the sea . <p> They got off at the harbor in Tejn , and the bus disappeared . <p> It was windy and cold , and the light from the sky hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked . It was like something that was exposed but ca n't resist it and is n't even aware of it . Seagulls hovered in the air above the harbor , screeching . <p> Bent bought four Gold Beers , and they started walking away from the coast . Barney said they should n't be too conspicuous in Tejn . <p> Shortly afterward , they stopped where there were leafless trees , a couple of houses , fields of bare soil . It looked utterly hopeless . There were no boulders in the immediate area  --  you could never anticipate when boulders would appear and disappear . <p> Barney opened the beers , got down two while Bent was still on his first . <p> " We 'll split the last one , " said Barney . <p> " It 's fucking mine , " Bent replied . <p> Barney looked at him . Then he took the bottle from him . <p> " There , " he said and put the bottle to his mouth while he looked Bent right in the eye . Barney emptied it and passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he did n't want to . He felt dizzy and had an urge to turn around and walk back toward the sea . Then he flung the bottle away from him . <p> Barney stood looking at the paper , turning it every which way . <p> " There 's a kind of tower , a stupid little tower outside the house , " he said . <p> " Yellow , the house is yellow . There 's a henhouse beside it , and everything smells like shit . " <p> " How do you know all this ? " Bent asked . <p> " Torben , man , " Barney answered . " Torben told me where the old geezer hides the money , too . " <p> " Where does he hide it ? " asked Bent . <p> Barney took a playful swing at him . " Not gon na tell you anymore till we get there . " <p> They started walking ; the soil was soft , it stuck to their shoes . They were n't used to it , and there was a pervasive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were ever going to find the right house in the middle of the countryside . <p> Barney turned the paper up and down and looked around . <p> " There it is , " he said . <p> A path led down toward a tiny house with a partly collapsed wooden tower in the garden . The house was yellow ; beside it was a henhouse . <p> They both stood very still , Barney and Bent . <p> ' There it is , " Barney said again , squinting . <p> It had gotten very bright ; the sky was saturated with sunshine . There was almost too much light . The house was completely exposed ; nothing moved . <p> At that very moment , a white hen raced through the garden past the wooden tower . <p> The door was unlocked  --  they always are in the country . They leave them like nothing ever could happen way out here . They do n't even want to bother . <p> The door handle went obligingly down when Barney laid his hand on it ; the door opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old man was sitting on a smudged sofa looking at them . He did n't seem especially surprised , like he had been expecting visitors . <p> Bent stood behind Barney holding the plastic bag . In a way , he had n't quite entered the house yet . <p> " Shut the door , " Barney told him . <p> The old man was sitting with a saucer in his hand . He lifted it slowly to his mouth and slurped some coffee . Afterward he set the saucer on the table . He was very small and had a cap on his head . <p> " Do you have a telephone ? " Barney asked . <p> " The neighbor does , " the old man replied . He spoke loudly with a strange , rather squeaky voice . <p> " That 's not why we 're asking , " Barney said and sat down at the table . <p> " You from Copenhagen ? " the old man asked . <p> Barney looked at Bent . Bent switched the plastic bag to his other hand . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa beside the old man . There was silence , nothing had happened yet , everything was quiet , it was n't even windy anymore . <p> " We 've come for your money , " Barney said . <p> The old man looked at them  --  first at Barney , then at Bent . Then he sighed . <p> " I do n't have any money , " he said . He poured coffee from the thermos into the saucer . Bent had never seen anyone drink coffee like that , and he did n't like it . <p> " We know you got money , " Barney said . <p> The old man shook his head . Then he began drinking the coffee with slow slurping sounds . <p> Barney sat for a while and squinted . Barney did n't like the calm . It was too calm in here and almost normal . Shouting , screaming , and maybe even music seemed to be called for . Everything seemed confused by the lack of something . <p> Barney signaled to Bent , but Bent did n't move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger . <p> Then Barney got up , walked over to the old man , and slapped the saucer out of his hand . It clattered across the wooden floor and scared two cats that had been lying on a pile of newspapers by the wall . <p> " Cough up the money , " Barney said . He stood slightly hunched , inclined , just as he 'd stood over the blond girl last night . <p> The old man slowly rotated the cap on his head . <p> " Cough up the money , " Barney repeated and hunched even closer to him . " I mean business , you old fart . " <p> The old man slid back on the sofa . He looked surprised . <p> " Fart ? " he said . <p> At that very moment , Barney took a swing at him , and the cap flew off and ended up alongside the saucer . <p> Bent looked at the saucer and the cap over by the wall and then saw the old man 's face . His eyes were staring at Barney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bent thought that it would have been better if the old man 's mouth had been closed , but now it was open , completely open . It was as if his mouth was asking to be hit , and at that very moment , Barney swung at him with a closed fist and the old man 's dentures flew out of his mouth , collapsing his whole face so he looked even smaller . <p> " In the bureau , " the old man whispered . " Money 's in the bureau . " <p> Barney looked around . Then he pointed at Bent , and Bent went to the bureau and started opening drawers . <p> " Dump the shit on the floor , " Barney shouted . <p> The old man sat up very straight , sobbing . <p> In the third drawer there was a small roll of twenty-kroner bills with a red rubber band around them . Bent leafed through them , counting . <p> " Two hundred and forty kroner , " he said . <p> " Where 's the rest , you old fart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old man 's head quivered , not because he did n't want to answer , Bent thought , but because he could n't do anything but quiver . He quivered , and his mouth opened and shut . <p> " We 're going to kill you , " Barney said . He said it very clearly and slowly . <p> Sobbing , the old man stuck his hand in his pocket and put two kroner and twenty re on the table in front of him . <p> Barney stared at the coins , then swept them onto the floor and started shouting . <p> " You old fuck , you rotten piece of shit , you rat-infested cocksucking old bastard , " he shouted . <p> It struck Bent that he had never heard him use words like that before . He did n't understand why Barney was so angry . <p> " Give me the cord , " Barney told him . <p> Bent handed it to him and Barney started tying the old man 's hands together . The old man lifted his arms without being told . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had been waiting for this moment . Then he fell calmly back in the corner of the sofa with his eyes closed . <p> Barney went over to the bureau and pulled the remaining drawers out onto the floor . No money . <p> " We know you got seven thousand kroner , " Barney said . <p> The old man shook his head . He did n't open his eyes but held up his tied hands in front of him , as if they were proof he was telling the truth . <p> " He does n't have it , " said Bent . <p> " Idiot , " Barney replied . " I know he has it . Torben 's seen it . " <p> The old man pulled his legs underneath him . He was lying in a strange position , angled across the end of the sofa . He resembled a child trying to hide , squeezing his eyes and gums shut . He was no longer crying . <p> " Get that ax out in front of the house , " Barney said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't see the ax ? " Barney shouted . <p> " Sure I did , " Bent replied . He went outside and saw the ax leaning against the yellow wall in the sunlight . In a moment he was back in the room with the ax resting on the floor . <p> " Now we 're going to kill you , " Barney said . <p> Bent saw the old man nod . <p> Barney signaled to Bent . <p> Bent took the ax with him behind the sofa . Nothing had happened yet . <p> Barney had n't moved . The old man had n't moved . Nothing had happened yet . It was just like a picture , or a movie that had stopped . Bent stood there for a long time , almost like he was resting . He felt light ; nothing could change from now on . He was just standing there with a thin transparent wall around him . He was standing in a glass house . Alone . Almost outside his body . <p> " Where 's the money ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely different from where Bent was standing , but the sound reached him anyway . Bent did n't know how long it had taken to reach him but it did . <p> Bent saw the top of the old man 's bald head from above . Some gray hairs fringed the freckled pate . The old man shook his head very slowly . <p> Barney signaled to Bent . He did it from a place entirely different from where Bent was standing , yet the signal reached him . It took a while , but then the moment arrived when the signal reached him . <p> The ax felt very light as he raised it . The old man sat perfectly still as if he was prepared . <p> Then the ax fell slowly down toward the bald head , and the skin opened , and the skull opened , and darkness forced its way out of his head and filled the room , and the old man fell back on the sofa . <p> One of the cats began to yowl . <p> The light glowed in the garden on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it , " Barney said . <p> Translated by Stuart Goodale <p> Novelist , short-story writer , poet , and dramatist Sven Holm was born in 1940 and debuted in 1961 with the story collection Den store fjende ( The Big Enemy ) .
