<p> There 's Hwang Jang Yop sitting in an easy chair reading the newspaper and watching TV . There he is touring South Korea 's national cemetery , bowing and burning incense to honor the nation 's fallen soldiers . There he is marveling at Seoul 's noxious traffic jams . <p> Just about anything the 74-year-old former college professor does these days is front-page news here . In every movement , every statement and every item on his breakfast menu , South Korea is looking for clues : Is the highest-ranking defector in North Korean history for real or just another illusion in the forest of mirrors surrounding the mysterious Stalinist land ? <p> " We are confused , " said Kim Il Soon , 59 , a housewife catching a bus in downtown Seoul . " On the one hand , I want to believe him . But I can not completely trust him or anyone else from the North . They have so many faces . " <p> Determining whether to believe Hwang is of critical importance to South Korea and the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more aggressively than most observers had believed . And he has said the North possesses nuclear weapons , which most analysts have tended to doubt . Hwang 's assertions could affect millions of lives and pose serious problems for Seoul and Washington , if they prove true . <p> No one doubts Hwang 's extensive resume : For decades , he has been a member of North Korea 's secretive inner circle . He was a friend of the late national founder Kim Il Sung and taught communist theory to Kim 's son , the current leader , Kim Jong Il . He was the chief architect of North Korea 's guiding philosophy , juche , or self-reliance . Hwang knows more about North Korean decision making than anyone who has ever fled the nation ; his defection would be comparable , some say , to Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin defecting from the Soviet Union . <p> But the consensus stops there . Since Hwang sought asylum at the South Korean consulate in Beijing on Feb. 12 , and especially since he arrived in Seoul last Sunday , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear view emerging . <p> " We think he is basically legitimate , but are watching him with a wholesome skepticism , " said one Western official in Seoul . <p> Ban Ki Moon , national security adviser to South Korean President Kim Young Sam , said he believes most of what Hwang has said , except that he is " not quite sure " whether to believe North Korea has nuclear weapons . " I find no reason not to accept his credibility , but there are points which we need to verify , " Ban said . <p> Many South Koreans accept Hwang at face value , welcoming him and the extensive secrets he presumably can provide about the militaristic regime in the North . " But to many of us conservatives here in South Korea , especially those of us who experienced the Korean War , we do n't trust him , " said Kim Jang Kon , 62 , an agricultural specialist . " How can the person who was the ideologue of juche suddenly just change his mind one day ? Is that possible ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seoul , where they are beginning a debriefing that could take months . Only then will U.S. officials have an opportunity to question Hwang , so it will be a long time before a clearer picture emerges of his veracity and his long-term benefit to the allies united against North Korea 's massive military machine . <p> South Korean and U.S. officials say Hwang has not been questioned extensively since he sought asylum two months ago . The main focus has been getting him to Seoul , and his South Korean hosts say they did not want to ask him too many tough questions that might risk his changing his mind in Beijing . <p> Scrutiny of Hwang 's intentions has centered around his statements since arriving in Seoul and five letters he apparently wrote before his defection , which were published by the Chosun Ilbo newspaper . It is unclear how the paper obtained the letters , although it is believed to have many sources in the South Korean intelligence agency , which has confirmed the authenticity of much of what the paper has printed . <p> Hwang repeatedly has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he describes as a single divided homeland . He said he came to warn South Korea that the North is determined to reunify the peninsula through war , and that it has nuclear weapons and no qualms about using them . <p> " The North regards the South as an enemy and it plans to reunify the country by obliterating the South , " Hwang wrote last August . <p> Although the North has shown increasing willingness to engage South Korea and the United States , Hwang warns that the North has no intention of seeking peace through negotiation . The North " acknowledges dialogue only as a trick to isolate the South and disguise its preparations for the invasion of the South through armed forces , " Hwang wrote . <p> He said he was willing to " sacrifice my family and comrades " in the North , who may face imprisonment or execution because he defected , because he had " no choice but to surrender to the voice of conscience " by coming to the South to " awaken the nation to a nearing national tragedy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which colors some skeptics ' view of the information he provides . <p> In letters written last November , Hwang acknowledged that he had fallen out of favor with Kim Jong Il , saying that " my downfall is inevitable . " That has led some here to believe that Hwang defected out of anger and self-interest rather than the greater good of the Korean Peninsula . If that is the case , they argue , Hwang is more likely to say whatever his South Korean hosts want to hear , rather than the truth . <p> Some suspect that Hwang may simply be bitter that he was pushed aside as a younger generation came to power in North Korea following Kim Il Sung 's death in 1994 . <p> One analyst likened Hwang to the Russian writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn . When he fled the Soviet Union for the United States , Americans assumed that he must be a crusader for democracy and capitalism . Only later did people realize Solzhenitsyn hated Western capitalistic values . The analyst argued that Hwang 's defection , too , may not signal a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pique that no one was listening to him anymore . <p> " I do n't believe him , " said Choi Kyu Han , 48 , a grocery store owner . " I think he lost his power and his influence , so he defected . I do n't trust him . " <p> Most serious analysts do n't believe Hwang is some kind of Trojan Horse acting on the North 's behalf . But some South Koreans , who have endured decades of infiltrations and spies and treachery from the North , can not quite dismiss that nagging possibility . <p> " I suspect very much that he might have been sent by someone up there , " said Kim Sung Eun , 21 , an architecture student . " He was so well positioned up there , he had no reason to defect , so I do n't understand why he did . " <p> Some also think Hwang may be overstating his knowledge , especially in his assertion that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons . While he certainly knows about North Korean decision making , does a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One U.S. intelligence official said there has been a " real battle royal " among U.S. officials about whether North Korea has nuclear bombs . Most officials agree North Korea has enough plutonium to make at least one or two bombs , but there is no agreement about whether they have actually produced working weapons , or whether they have the engineering prowess or missile technology to do so . <p> " I can explain to you the theory of an atom bomb , but I sure as hell ca n't build one , " the official said . " You can have the fuel , but it 's a long way from there to operational nuclear weapons . " <p> Still , he said , until more is known about the basis for Hwang 's assertions , no one can be sure . <p> Much of what Hwang has said has also fit the South Korean government 's agenda " too neatly and too conveniently " for some people to believe , some analysts say . In response to Hwang 's statements about defecting to promote peace between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to the ruling New Korea Party issued a statement saying , " A cow would laugh at that . " <p> That group and other skeptics suspect that Hwang is being manipulated by South Korea 's intelligence agency to make inflammatory anti-North statements to increase public support for the Seoul government 's tough stance toward Pyongyang . <p> The skepticism grew so loud this week that the intelligence bureau , the Agency for National Security Planning , issued a formal denial that it is coaching Hwang . <p> " I give him credit for his determination to save this country , " said Lee Seung Chul , 41 , a trading company employee . " I do n't trust everything he says . But our intelligence service will soon find out the truth . "
