I 'm a nice guy , that 's all you really have to know . A very nice guy . Patient , kind , forgiving . The kind of guy who picks his brother-in-law up at the airport when he 's visiting on business all the way from Minneapolis , and then takes his brother-in-law home to his apartment on the Westside , and pulls out the folding bed . <p> A word about my brother-in-law : he is the single most boring individual on the planet , bar none . He 's made boredom a science . He cultivates it , seeks his opportunities , gluts himself with trivia and inanity till they seep through his pores . His features are boring , his clothes are boring , his shoes , socks , and hat . They would n't need anesthesiologists in hospitals if they had Fred . You 've got grief , survivor 's guilt , terminal angst ? Spend five minutes with Fred . He 'll cure it . <p> Anyway , I met him at the gate , and I was there early enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side of him , people in the last throes of brain death who 'd obviously been condemned to sit beside him during the three-and-a-half-hour flight . The man on his right-thirtyish , with one of those caved-in heads and eyes set so far back under the ridge of his brow you need binoculars to spot them-looked as if he 'd got the worst of it . I could just make out Fred 's voice in the general clamor-a monotone that took hold of you like a rat terrier at the throat of a rat-as he gave the zombie on his left some parting advice about aluminum siding , then swung deftly to his right and caught his other victim by the sleeve , already segueing into his directions mode . <p> " The Mariott ? " he was saying , stretching out the syllables as if he were pulling them one by one from a pot of fondue , " well , you have to go out here to your right-this is World Way , but you know that , right ? Okay , and then you just head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in any other direction because Century deadends at the airport-to where you see that sign that says Totally Nude ' ? Right ? Are you with me ? Anyway , there 's this taco stand there , kitty  --  corner across the street , and if you want Mexican there 's no finer place in all L.A. County , believe me- " <p> I tried to be patient , but after ten minutes during which Fred completely ignored me , if he saw me at all , I came up on his blind side and suddenly thrust my face between his and his victim 's . " Fred ! " I screamed . " It 's great to see you ! " <p> Fred never even flinched . He had his man by the sleeve and he was n't letting go . " Then you make a left , " he was saying , his voice stone cold dead , and I had no choice but to wait him out . <p> In the car , Fred told me about the round of golf he 'd played the day before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . " Fred , " I interrupted , trying to distract him , " Fred , hey ! So you 're in town for the night , batching it-what do you want to do ? Take in a show , go to a club , tattoo parlor , strip joint ? You name it . And I wo n't breathe a word to Darlene , even if she is my sister- " <p> He was staring at the side of my head as I drove , the lights of the oncoming traffic illuminating his face as if it were a big looming ball of swamp gas . " So I figured I 'd go with the sand wedge , " he said after the briefest of pauses , " because , as I say , it was no more than sixty , sixty-five yards to the hole , and the water hazard there was really hairy , you should have seen it , fifty yards wide itself and with probably a thousand golf balls down at the bottom of it ... well , anyway , as I say , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we turned up Wilshire , maybe ten blocks from my apartment , a tiny voice switched itself on inside my head , and it was a vital , self-preserving voice , tuned to the frequency of reason and existential dread : " So , Fred , " I heard myself say as we passed beneath a brightly illuminated billboard displaying a monumental pair of lips against the nullity of a black background , " you hungry ? I mean , do you want to go out and get something to eat ? A cocktail maybe ? Anything ? " I was stalling for time . I could n't live with the idea of taking him home , where I 'd be trapped like an animal-not yet , anyway . <p> " I blew the putt , " he was saying , " and I could n't believe it , a good uphill lie , no more than ten feet , and I blow it-on the last hole , no less . " There was a silence . We 'd got to hole number eighteen and there <p> were no more left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he said , " I ate on the plane . " Another silence . " But maybe I could have a little bite of something . Some fondue maybe . " <p> Now , when I mentioned fondue earlier-strictly in a figurative sense-I suppose it was some sort of unconscious manifestation of my innermost fears . Fondue , as I recalled from my last ( and final ) visit to Minneapolis , was Fred 's favorite food . Why , I ca n't fathom . Except maybe that it 's boring . " Fondue ? " I said , my voice reduced to an expiring gasp . " I do n't think we have any fondue in L.A. This is n't exactly Switzerland , you know . " <p> But then Fred astonished me : he made a joke . " I thought , " he said , drawing it out , sticky-fingered already , " I thought this was the great melting pot . " <p> Inside , while Fred settled into the couch with one of the home plumbing manuals he 'd brought along for light reading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater L.A. phonebook , looking for fondue . I tried a place in Downey , called  --  promisingly enough- " Yodelayeehoo , " but the voice that answered had a heavy unrecognizable accent , and when I asked for fondue it galvanized itself into perfect English long enough to say " Hey , fondue  --  you too " before breaking the connection . Finally I found a place in Reseda called " Swiss Miss , " and after being assured by a crisp and patient female of indeterminate age that they did indeed specialize in Fred 's sine qua non and that they had plenty of available parking and took every major credit card , personal checks , and maybe even LO.U.s , depending , I made a reservation for eight-thirty and Fred and I got back in the car . <p> Reseda is in the Valley , but do n't get me started on that-suffice it to say that it took an eternity and a half to get there . And what was the sole topic of discussion between me and my brother-in-law through all those grueling miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right . Fred was thinking of getting a new chainsaw , and he could n't seem to decide between a good old-fashioned Black &; Decker or one of these imported jobs , and there was good and bad on both sides of the issue , no doubt about that , <p> We found Swiss Miss on a street that featured two malfunctioning streetlights and a succession of extra-wide dumpsters stretched out along the curb as far as the eye could see . It was a storefront place , sandwiched between a Tae Kwon Do parlor and a bakery that specialized in Mongolian seed cakes . I parked right in front , behind some sort of sportscar with one of those automotive teddies stretched over the whole length of the thing . " Well , Fred , " I sighed , " we 're here . Fondue land . " <p> He was in the middle of a dissertation on air-injection and antivibration dampers , and he looked surprised . " Already ? " was all he said . <p> We were greeted at the door by a woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sixty , and Fred shifted directly into his foreign directions mode , reminiscing for her benefit over the street names in Zurich and how he would go each morning from his hotel to the American Express office before breakfast-this was during a four-day stay there back in the spring of eightyseven , the year of the flooding in the Schwyz Canton ? - yes , sure , and did she remember the way it just kept raining and raining ? She was a slippery one , though , and after seating us with brutal efficiency and neutralizing Fred 's face with the menu she inserted between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand , she deftly handed us off to the Pakistani waiter . <p> The waiter , incidentally , had been hovering over the table of the only other diner in the place , a man of Fred 's age ( early forties ) and approximate size ( lean through the torso , thickish in the neck , bulbous from there up ) . This man , who sported a fashionably shaven head and a pair of glasses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred mission to bore the waiter into an upright grave . I overheard the terms " specifications " and " F-stop " at least six times in the space of a minute , and then I tuned him out . In the interim , Fred had launched into his informative mode , choosing the Swiss Army knife as his subject . Did I know they were made in Korea now ? And that , in addition to the can opener , wine key , and nail file , they now featured miniature syringes , to appeal to Guatemalan junkies ? <p> That was when the waiter managed to disengage himself and come to my aid . I needed a drink , and I trumped Fred by asking for a J &B; and soda before he could begin reprising the way from the Hotel Excelsior in downtown Karachi to the beaches of Sonmiani Bay . <p> " I 'm sorry , sir , " the waiter informed me in his dutiful King 's English , " but we do n't have a full bar-wine and beer only , I 'm afraid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Again sorry . We serve only Kasebrau-it 's a premium Swiss beer , the very nectar and essence of all things Swiss-but I 'm afraid we 're out of that right now . And wine too . " <p> The news hit me hard . I 'd been hoping to blunt my senses to a point just short of rigor mortis . " What do you have ? " <p> The waiter leaned forward , beaming . " In a word , " he said , " kirsch . " " Kirsch ? " <p> " Yes , sir . We use it in the fondue , you see , and so " - with a wink " I think I can arrange for you to have maybe just a nip of it on the side . " <p> " Make mine a double , " I said , and then I turned to Fred , who 'd been uncharacteristically silent through this exchange , awaiting his opening . " Have you ever been to the north , Khyber Pass and all that ? " he asked , staring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beautiful country , what with the hills and all . No ? You must know Shirarpur , at least , at the base of the Sulaiman Range , I mean that 's a lot closer to home ... It 's really nothing to get there , nothing at all . From the Merewether Tower in Karachi-you know that , of course-you make a left and then two rights-I ca n't remember the street names now-and then you come to the bus station . Well , that 's where you have to be careful , because- " <p> Fifteen minutes later , the woman in pigtails darted out of the kitchen to rescue the waiter , who 'd stood there rooted to the linoleum like a deaf-mute , nodding his head once for yes and twice for no , as Fred buried him in an avalanche of irrelevancies , improvised facts , and half  --  remembered locations . " Fred , " I blurted , feeling subversive all of a sudden as I sipped at my kirsch ( imagine nail polish remover flavored with grenadine ) , " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were at ag school ? A summer fling ? Houris and hookahs ? " <p> This seemed to catch my brother-in-law by surprise . He looked up from the menu ( forty-three varieties of fondue , forty-one of which they were temporarily out of ) and for a moment locked eyes with the specifications bore in the corner . " I do n't know , " he sighed , and it was the closest he 'd come to expressing emotion in all the time I 'd known him . " Black &; Decker has the name , you know , but I wonder if it 's just the tradition I 'm attracted to instead of going ahead and making an informed decision , all prejudice aside , because these Swedes do have a pretty impressive track record , I mean Jonsered and all that - and Husqvarna , they 're Swedes too , are n't they ? " <p> Then it was the fondue itself , glutinous and bland as gelatinized water , chunks of what looked suspiciously like stir-fry appearing briefly on the tines of our long-necked forks before emerging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them anyway . I ate desperately , greedily , suicidally , ate because there was nothing else to do , nowhere to go , no escape from the reality that was Fred . Fred , on the other hand , seemed to be enjoying himself , though it was hard to tell since his inflection never changed as he switched neatly from chainsaws to lawn mowers to roofing material-he and Darlene were thinking of reroofing sometime in the next couple of years , no problems yet , but you never can be too cautious , especially with the way the weather 's been going haywire lately and did I have any idea of the kind of variation in the daily mean temperature they were seeing in Minneapolis over the past fourteen years ? I did n't . I drank kirsch steadily , my hand grafted to the glass . <p> It was then , just when things were looking blackest , that the specifications bore got up from his seat in the back and crossed the room to our table , looming over us suddenly , his big pale head floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Excuse me , " he said , ignoring me entirely and focusing on Fred , " but I could n't help overhearing what you were saying about Hardishake , because as coincidence would have it , I just reroofed my cabin up in Big Bear  --  you know Big Bear ? No , no , it 's the easiest place in the world to get toyou just take the 210 over to the 10 and continue on out past Pomona and Ontario , and then you take the 30 north at Redlands and follow that until it becomes the 330 and then the 18- " <p> I was stunned . In awe . As the specifications bore went on without pausing for breath , going from roofing material to Big Bear to fourwheel-drive vehicles and the declining snowpack , I knew Fred had met his match . Within two minutes he was sitting at our table ; by the fiveminute mark he 'd switched subjects eight times ; and ten minutes into his soliloquy-and that 's what it was , an inspired schizophrenic filibustering paean to boredom-he had Fred on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt about it , countering snow tires with power tools , the.spicy chicken sandwich with the Big Mac , and the Great Wall of China with the breeding grounds of the manatees off the west coast of Florida ( also known as dugongs , did we know that ? ) , but he was out of his league , even I could see that . The kirsch flowed . The waiter backed away from the table as if it were writhing with venomous snakes , and the dirndled proprietress shrank back into the shadows . " Charlton Heston , " Fred said in his penetrating monotone , " now there 's an actor , " but the new man was already reciting the complete plots , with representative dialogue , of every known episode of The Beverly Hillbillies , and Fred 's voice died in his throat . <p> It was later , much later-in fact I had no idea of the time or where or even who I was , just that I was kirsch-addled and near comatose-when we found ourselves out in the unilluminated street , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sportscar that had been hooded from view when we arrived , a darkly gleaming thing he claimed to have put together from a kit . We were standing there , the three of us , he going on about carburetion and Fred doggedly countering with fuel injectors , overhead cams , and the sad decline of Detroit , when a stolen Hyundai driven by three teenage gangbangers rocketed out of an alley with its lights off and cut me down before I even knew it was there . <p> I woke in the hospital , and I seemed to be in traction , my limbs encased in plaster , pulleys dangling , wires stretched taut . The windows were dark . There was the hum of monitors , a soft glow of greenish lights . I thought at first I was alone , but then I made out Fred 's figure seated in a chair at the end of the bed . " You 're awake , " he said . <p> " I-yeah-I , what happened , I mean- ? " <p> " You 're going to be fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a slab in the morgue . " They 're saying six months , seven at the most , but I called Darlene and the people at the office and do n't you worry , I 'm going to be here for you . I know what it 's like to be stretched out like this , helpless and all , because of my gallstone operation , but that 's another story . Plenty of time for that . " <p> He had something in his lap , a suitcase , the suitcase he 'd been swinging from side to side when I picked him up at the airport . It was a bulky thing , hard gray laminated plastic , and he was tapping it thoughtfully . " I figured what you needed in your state of mind is some entertainment , so I brought along the tapes of Ethan 's last three little league seasons , all forty-two of them , and that goes back to their championship year in ninety-five , so you can see the way these kids developed , and then , well , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloom and the television screen over the bed flickered to life . The scene was of a grassy field , a distant chain-link fence . There was a blur of movement . " That 's Ethan there , in the ondeck circle , see him ? And this kid on the mound , Bobby Mulroney , he 's got heat , a wicked curve and a changeup , and he 'll strike out twelve , thirteen a game , but here it comes , look , watch , that 's going to be a ball right there , outside and away , but this second pitch , this one 's really something- " <p> Author Affiliation
