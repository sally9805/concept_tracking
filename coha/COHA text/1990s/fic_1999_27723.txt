WILLING How can I live my life without committing an act with a giant scissors ?  - -  JOYCE CAROL OATES , " An Interior Monologue " In her last picture , the camera had lingered at the hip , the naked hip , and even though it was n't her hip , she acquired a reputation for being willing . " You have the body , " studio heads told her over lunch at Chasen 's . She looked away . " Habeas corpus , " she said , not smiling . " Pardon me ? " A hip that knew Latin . Christ . " Nothing , " she said . They smiled at her and dropped names . Scorsese , Brando . Work was all playtime to them , playtime with gel in their hair . At times , she felt bad that it was n't her hip . It should have been her hip . A mediocre picture , a picture queasy with pornography : these , she knew , eroticized the unavailable . The doctored and false . The stand-in . Unwittingly , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unavailable , anonymous hip . She herself was true as a goddamn dairy product ; available as lunch whenever . But she was pushing forty . She began to linger in juice bars . Sit for entire afternoons in places called I Love Juicy or Orange-U-Sweet . She drank juice and , outside , smoked a cigarette now and then . She 'd been taken seriously -- once -- she knew that . Projects were discussed : Nina . Portia . Mother Courage with makeup . Now her hands trembled too much , even drinking juice , especially drinking juice , a Vantage wobbling between her fingers like a compass dial . She was sent scripts in which she was supposed to say lines she would never say , not wear clothes she would never not wear . She began to get obscene phone calls , and postcards signed , " Oh yeah , baby . " Her boyfriend , a director with a growing reputation for expensive flops , a man who twice a week glowered at her Fancy Sunburst guppy and told it to get a job , became a Catholic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were working out the bumps and chops and rocks , " she said . Then she wept . " I know , " he said . " I know . " And so she left Hollywood . Phoned her agent and apologized . Went home to Chicago , rented a room by the week at the Days Inn , drank sherry , and grew a little plump . She let her life get dull -- dull , but with Hostess cakes . There were moments bristling with deadness , when she looked out at her life and went " What ? " Or worse , feeling interrupted and tired , " Wha --  ? " It had taken on the shape of a terrible mistake . She had n't been given the proper tools to make a real life with , she decided , that was it . She 'd been given a can of gravy and a hairbrush and told , " There you go . " She 'd stood there for years , blinking and befuddled , brushing the can with the brush . Still , she was a minor movie star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her indirectly . A notice . A bill . A Thanksgiving card . But there was never a party , a dinner , an opening , an iced tea . One of the problems with people in Chicago , she remembered , was that they were never lonely at the same time . Their sadnesses occurred in isolation , lurched and spazzed , sent them spinning fizzily back into empty , padded corners , disconnected and alone . She watched cable and ordered in a lot from a pizza place . A life of obscurity and radical calm . She rented a piano and practiced scales . She invested in the stock market . She wrote down her dreams in the morning to locate clues as to what to trade . Disney , her dreams said once . St. Jude 's Medical . She made a little extra money . She got obsessed . The words cash cow nestled in the side of her mouth like a cud . She tried to be original -- not a good thing with stocks -- and she began to lose . When a stock went down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way back up . She got confused . She took to staring out the window at Lake Michigan , the rippled slate of it like a blackboard gone bad . " Sidra , what are you doing there ? " shrieked her friend Tommy long distance over the phone . " Where are you ? You 're living in some state that borders on North Dakota ! " He was a screenwriter in Santa Monica and once , a long time ago and depressed on Ecstasy , they had slept together . He was gay , but they had liked each other very much . " Maybe I 'll get married , " she said . She did n't mind Chicago . She thought of it as a cross between London and Queens , with a dash of Cleveland . " Oh , please , " he shrieked again . " What are you really doing ? " " Listening to seashore and self-esteem tapes , " she said . She blew air into the mouth of the phone . " Sounds like dust on the needle , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape . Have you heard the squawking crickets tape ? " " I got a bad perm today , " she said . " When I was only halfway through with the rod part , the building the salon 's in had a blackout . There were men drilling out front who 'd struck a cable . " " How awful for you , " he said . She could hear him tap his fingers . He had made himself the make-believe author of a make-believe book of essays called One Man 's Opinion , and when he was bored or inspired , he quoted from it . " I was once in a rock band called Bad Perm , " he said instead . " Get out . " She laughed . His voice went hushed and worried . " What are you doing there ? " he asked again . Her room was a corner room where a piano was allowed . It was L-shaped , like a life veering off suddenly to become something else . It had a couch and two maple dressers and was never as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DO NOT DISTURB sign on when the maids came by , and so things got a little out of hand . Wispy motes of dust and hair the size of small heads bumped around in the corners . Smudge began to darken the moldings and cloud the mirrors . The bathroom faucet dripped , and , too tired to phone anyone , she tied a string around the end of it , guiding the drip quietly into the drain , so it would n't bother her anymore . Her only plant , facing east in the window , hung over the popcorn popper and dried to a brown crunch . On the ledge , a jack-o ' - lantern she had carved for Halloween had rotted , melted , froze , and now looked like a collapsed basketball -- one she might have been saving for sentimental reasons , one from the big game ! The man who brought her room service each morning -- two poached eggs and a pot of coffee -- reported her to the assistant manager , and she received a written warning slid under the door . On Fridays , she visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father to look her in the eyes . He was seventy now . Ten years ago , he had gone to the first movie she had ever been in , saw her remove her clothes and dive into a pool . The movie was rated PG , but he never went to another one . Her mother went to all of them and searched later for encouraging things to say . Even something small . She refused to lie . " I liked the way you said the line about leaving home , your eyes wide and your hands fussing with your dress buttons , " she wrote . " That red dress was so becoming . You should wear bright colors ! " " My father takes naps a lot when I visit , " she said to Tommy . " Naps ? " " I embarrass him . He thinks I 'm a whore hippie . A hippie whore . " " That 's ridiculous . As I said in One Man 's Opinion , you 're the most sexually conservative person I know . " " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , puddle-eyed . These days , she was reading thin paperback books by a man named Robert Valleys , a man who said that after observing all the suffering in the world -- war , starvation , greed -- he had discovered the cure : hugs . Hugs , hugs , hugs , hugs , hugs . Her mother believed him . She squeezed so long and hard that Sidra , like an infant or a lover , became lost in the feel and smell of her -- her sweet , dry skin , the gray peach fuzz on her neck . " I 'm so glad you left that den of iniquity , " her mother said softly . But Sidra still got calls from the den . At night , sometimes , the director phoned from a phone booth , desiring to be forgiven as well as to direct . " I think of all the things you might be thinking , and I say , Oh , Christ . ' I mean , do you think the things I sometimes think you do ? " " Of course , " said Sidra . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course ! Of course is a term that has no place in this conversation ! " When Tommy phoned , she often felt a pleasure so sudden and flooding , it startled her . " God , I 'm so glad it 's you ! " " You have no right to abandon American filmmaking this way ! " he would say affectionately , and she would laugh loudly , for minutes without stopping . She was starting to have two speeds : Coma and Hysteria . Two meals : breakfast and popcorn . Two friends : Charlotte Peveril and Tommy . She could hear the clink of his bourbon glass . " You are too gifted a person to be living in a state that borders on North Dakota . " " Iowa . " " Holy bejesus , it 's worse than I thought . I 'll bet they say that there . I 'll bet they say Bejesus . ' " " I live downtown . They do n't say that here . " " Are you anywhere near Champaign-Urbana ? " " No . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be a different kind of place . I kept saying to myself , Champagne , urbah na , champagne , urbah na ! Champagne ! Urbana ! ' " He sighed . " It was just this thing in the middle of a field . I went to a Chinese restaurant there and ordered my entire dinner with extra MSG . " " I 'm in Chicago . It 's not so bad . " " Not so bad . There are no movie people there . Sidra , what about your acting talent ? " " I have no acting talent . " " Hello ? " " You heard me . " " I 'm not sure . For a minute there , I thought maybe you had that dizziness thing again , that inner-ear imbalance . " " Talent . I do n't have talent . I have willingness . What talent ? " As a kid , she had always told the raunchiest jokes . As an adult , she could rip open a bone and speak out of it . Simple , clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there never anything to stop her ? " I can stretch out the neck of a sweater to point at a freckle on my shoulder . Anyone who did n't get enough attention in nursery school can do that . Talent is something else . " " Excuse me , okay ? I 'm only a screenwriter . But someone 's got you thinking you went from serious actress to aging bimbo . That 's ridiculous . You just have to weather things a little out here . Besides . I think willing yourself to do a thing is brave , and the very essence of talent . " Sidra looked at her hands , already chapped and honeycombed with bad weather , bad soap , bad life . She needed to listen to the crickets tape . " But I do n't will myself , " she said . " I 'm just already willing . " She began to go to blues bars at night . Sometimes she called Charlotte Peveril , her one friend left from high school . " Siddy , how are you ? " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in L.A. , people had thought it was beautiful and assumed she 'd made it up . " I 'm fine . Let 's go get drunk and listen to music . " Sometimes she just went by herself . " Do n't I know you from the movies ? " a man might ask at one of the breaks , smiling , leering in a twinkly way . " Maybe , " she 'd say , and he would look suddenly panicked and back away . One night , a handsome man in a poncho , a bad poncho -- though was there such a thing as a good poncho ? asked Charlotte -- sat down next to her with an extra glass of beer . " You look like you should be in the movies , " he said . Sidra nodded wearily . " But I do n't go to the movies . So if you were in the movies , I would never have gotten to set my eyes on you . " She turned her gaze from his poncho to her sherry , then back . Perhaps he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you do ? " " I 'm an auto mechanic . " He looked at her carefully . " My name 's Walter . Walt . " He pushed the second beer her way . " The drinks here are okay as long as you do n't ask them to mix anything . Just do n't ask them to mix anything ! " She picked it up and took a sip . There was something about him she liked : something earthy beneath the act . In L.A. , beneath the act you got nougat or Styrofoam . Or glass . Sidra 's mouth was lined with sherry . Walt 's lips shone with beer . " What 's the last movie you saw ? " she asked him . " The last movie I saw . Let 's see . " He was thinking , but she could tell he was n't good at it . She watched with curiosity the folded-in mouth , the tilted head : at last , a guy who did n't go to the movies . His eyes rolled back like the casters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I saw ? " " No . What ? " She was getting drunk . " It was this cartoon movie . " Animation . She felt relieved . At least it was n't one of those bad art films starring what's-her-name . " A man is asleep , having a dream about a beautiful little country full of little people . " Walt sat back , looked around the room , as if that were all . " And ? " She was going to have to push and pull with this guy . " And ? ' " he repeated . He leaned forward again . " And one day the people realize that they are only creatures in this man 's dream . Dream people ! And if the man wakes up , they will no longer exist ! " Now she hoped he would n't go on . She had changed her mind a little . " So they all get together at a town meeting and devise a plan , " he continued . Perhaps the band would be back soon . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to a padded , insulated room in the town -- the town of his own dream -- and there they will keep watch over him to make sure he stays asleep . And they do just that . Forever and ever , everyone guarding him carefully , but apprehensively , making sure he never wakes up . " He smiled . " I forget what the name of it was . " " And he never wakes up . " " Nope . " He grinned at her . She liked him . She could tell he could tell . He took a sip of his beer . He looked around the bar , then back at her . " Is this a great country or what ? " he said . She smiled at him , with longing . " Where do you live , " she asked , " and how do I get there ? " " I met a man , " she told Tommy on the phone . " His name is Walter . " " A forced relationship . You 're in a state of stress -- you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force this romance . What does he do ? " " Something with cars . " She sighed . " I want to sleep with someone . When I 'm sleeping with someone , I 'm less obsessed with the mail . " " But perhaps you should just be alone , be by yourself for a while . " " Like you 've ever been alone , " said Sidra . " I mean , have you ever been alone ? " " I 've been alone . " " Yeah , and for how long ? " " Hours , " said Tommy . He sighed . " At least it felt like hours . " " Right , " she said , " so do n't go lecturing me about inner resources . " " Okay . So I sold the mineral rights to my body years ago , but , hey , at least I got good money for mine . " " I got some money , " said Sidra . " I got some . " Walter leaned her against his parked car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anneloid and full , and he kissed her hard . There was something numb and on hold in her . There were small dark pits of annihilation she discovered in her heart , in the loosening fist of it , and she threw herself into them , falling . She went home with him , slept with him . She told him who she was . A minor movie star once nominated for a major award . She told him she lived at the Days Inn . He had been there once , to the top , for a drink . But he did not seem to know her name . " Never thought I 'd sleep with a movie star , " he did say . " I suppose that 's every man 's dream . " He laughed -- lightly , nervously . " Just do n't wake up , " she said . Then she pulled the covers to her chin . " Or change the dream , " he added seriously . " I mean , in the movie I saw , everything is fine until the sleeping guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he wills it or anything ; it just happens . " " You did n't tell me about that part . " " That 's right , " he said . " You see , the guy starts dreaming about flamingos and then all the little people turn into flamingos and fly away . " " Really ? " said Sidra . " I think it was flamingos . I 'm not too expert with birds . " " You 're not ? " She was trying to tease him , but it came out wrong , like a lizard with a little hat on . " To tell you the truth , I really do n't think I ever saw a single movie you were in . " " Good . " She was drifting , indifferent , no longer paying attention . He hitched his arm behind his head , wrist to nape . His chest heaved up and down . " I think I may of heard of you , though . " Django Reinhardt was on the radio . She listened , carefully . " Astonishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured . Walter tried to kiss her , tried to get her attention back . He was n't that interested in music , though at times he tried to be . " Astonishing sounds ' ? " he said . " Like this ? " He cupped his palms together , making little pops and suction noises . " Yeah , " she murmured . But she was elsewhere , letting a dry wind sweep across the plain of her to sleep . " Like that . " He began to realize , soon , that she did not respect him . A bug could sense it . A doorknob could figure it out . She never quite took him seriously . She would talk about films and film directors , then look at him and say , " Oh , never mind . " She was part of some other world . A world she no longer liked . And now she was somewhere else . Another world she no longer liked . But she was willing . Willing to give it a whirl . Once in a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , about having children , about turning kith to kin . How did he feel about all that ? It seemed to her that if she were ever going to have a life of children and lawn mowers and grass clippings , it would be best to have it with someone who was not demeaned or trivialized by discussions of them . Did he like those big fertilized lawns ? How about a nice rock garden ? How did he feel deep down about those combination storm windows with the built-in screens ? " Yeah , I like them all right , " he said , and she would nod slyly and drink a little too much . She would try then not to think too strenuously about her whole life . She would try to live life one day at a time , like an alcoholic -- drink , do n't drink , drink . Perhaps she should take drugs . " I always thought someday I would have a little girl and name her after my grandmother . " Sidra sighed , peered wistfully into her sherry . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his paisley mouth . " Grandma . Her name was Grandma . " Walter laughed in a honking sort of way . " Oh , thank you , " murmured Sidra . " Thank you for laughing . " Walter had a subscription to AutoWeek . He flipped through it in bed . He also liked to read repair manuals for new cars , particularly the Toyotas . He knew a lot about control panels , light-up panels , side panels . " You 're so obviously wrong for each other , " said Charlotte over tapas at a tapas bar . " Hey , please , " said Sidra . " I think my taste 's a little subtler than that . " The thing with tapas bars was that you just kept stuffing things into your mouth . " Obviously wrong is just the beginning . That 's where I always begin . At obviously wrong . " In theory , she liked the idea of mismatched couples , the wrangling and retangling , like a comedy by Shakespeare . " I ca n't imagine you with someone like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had met him only once . But she had heard of him from a girlfriend of hers . He had slept around , she 'd said . " Into the pudding " is how she phrased it , and there were some boring stories . " Just do n't let him humiliate you . Do n't mistake a lack of sophistication for sweetness , " she added . " I 'm supposed to wait around for someone special , while every other girl in this town gets to have a life ? " " I do n't know , Sidra . " It was true . Men could be with whomever they pleased . But women had to date better , kinder , richer , and bright , bright , bright , or else people got embarrassed . It suggested sexual things . " I 'm a very average person , " she said desperately , somehow detecting that Charlotte already knew that , knew the deep , dark , wildly obvious secret of that , and how it made Sidra slightly pathetic , unseemly -- inferior , when you got right down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in the stare of a deer . Guns do n't kill people , thought Sidra fizzily . Deer kill people . " Maybe it 's that we all used to envy you so much , " Charlotte said a little bitterly . " You were so talented . You got all the lead parts in the plays . You were everyone 's dream of what they wanted . " Sidra poked around at the appetizer in front of her , gardening it like a patch of land . She was unequal to anyone 's wistfulness . She had made too little of her life . Its loneliness shamed her like a crime . " Envy , " said Sidra . " That 's a lot like hate , is n't it . " But Charlotte did n't say anything . Probably she wanted Sidra to change the subject . Sidra stuffed her mouth full of feta cheese and onions , and looked up . " Well , all I can say is , I 'm glad to be back . " A piece of feta dropped from her lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you mean , " she said . She opened her mouth wide and let all the food inside fall out onto the table . Charlotte could be funny like that . Sidra had forgotten that about her . Walter had found some of her old movies in the video-rental place . She had a key . She went over one night and discovered him asleep in front of Recluse with Roommate . It was about a woman named Rose who rarely went out , because when she did , she was afraid of people . They seemed like alien life-forms -- soulless , joyless , speaking asyntactically . Rose quickly became loosened from reality . Walter had it freeze-framed at the funny part , where Rose phones the psych ward to have them come take her away , but they refuse . She lay down next to him and tried to sleep , too , but began to cry a little . He stirred . " What 's wrong ? " he asked . " Nothing . You fell asleep . Watching me . " " I was tired , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me kiss you . Let me find your panels . " His eyes were closed . She could be anybody . " Did you like the beginning part of the movie ? " This need in her was new . Frightening . It made her hair curl . When had she ever needed so much ? " It was okay , " he said . * * * " So what is this guy , a race-car driver ? " asked Tommy . " No , he 's a mechanic . " " Ugh ! Quit him like a music lesson ! " " Like a music lesson ? What is this , Similes from the Middle Class ? One Man 's Opinion ? " She was irritated . " Sidra . This is not right ! You need to go out with someone really smart for a change . " " I 've been out with smart . I 've been out with someone who had two Ph.D . ' s . We spent all of our time in bed with the light on , proofreading his vita . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever done , every little , little , little . I mean , have you ever seen a vita ? " Tommy sighed , too . He had heard this story of Sidra 's before . " Yes , " he said . " I thought Patti LuPone was great . " " Besides , " she said . " Who says he 's not smart ? " The Japanese cars were the most interesting . Though the Americans were getting sexier , trying to keep up with them . Those Japs ! " Let 's talk about my world , " she said . " What world ? " " Well , something I 'm interested in . Something where there 's something in it for me . " " Okay . " He turned and dimmed the lights , romantically . " Got a stock tip for you , " he said . She was horrified , dispirited , interested . He told her the name of a company somebody at work invested in . AutVis . " What is it ? " " I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're going to make some announcement . If I had money , I 'd buy . " She bought , the very next morning . A thousand shares . By the afternoon , the stock had plummeted 10 percent ; by the following morning , 50 . She watched the ticker tape go by on the bottom of the TV news channel . She had become the major stockholder . The major stockholder of a dying company ! Soon they were going to be calling her , wearily , to ask what she wanted done with the forklift . " You 're a neater eater than I am , " Walter said to her over dinner at the Palmer House . She looked at him darkly . " What the hell were you thinking of , recommending that stock ? " she asked . " How could you be such an irresponsible idiot ? " She saw it now , how their life would be together . She would yell ; then he would yell . He would have an affair ; then she would have an affair . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would live in that gone . " I got the name wrong , " he said . " Sorry . " " You what ? " " It was n't AutVis . It was AutDrive . I kept thinking it was vis for vision . " " Vis for vision , ' " she repeated . " I 'm not that good with names , " confessed Walter . " I do better with concepts . " " Concepts , ' " she repeated as well . The concept of anger . The concept of bills . The concept of flightless , dodo love . Outside , there was a watery gust from the direction of the lake . " Chicago , " said Walter . " The Windy City . Is this the Windy City or what ? " He looked at her hopefully , which made her despise him more . She shook her head . " I do n't even know why we 're together , " she said . " I mean , why are we even together ? " He looked at her hard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled . He took two steps back , away from her . " You 've got to answer that for yourself ! " And he hailed his own cab , got in , and rode away . She walked back to the Days Inn alone . She played scales soundlessly , on the tops of the piano keys , her thin-jointed fingers lifting and falling quietly like the tines of a music box or the legs of a spider . When she tired , she turned on the television , moved through the channels , and discovered an old movie she 'd been in , a love story -- murder mystery called ITLFinishing TouchesITL . It was the kind of performance she had become , briefly , known for : a patched-together intimacy with the audience , half cartoon , half revelation ; a cross between shyness and derision . She had not given a damn back then , sort of like now , only then it had been a style , a way of being , not a diagnosis or demise . Perhaps she should have a baby . In the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For winter , they had plastic-wrapped their home -- the wondows , the doors -- so that it looked like a piece of avant-garde art . " Saves on heating bills , " they said . They had taken to discussing her in front of her . " It was a movie , Don . It was a movie about adventure . Nudity can be art . " " That 's not how I saw it ! That 's not how I saw it at all ! " said her father , red-faced , leaving the room . Naptime . " How are you doing ? " askec her mother , with what seemed like concern but was really an opening for something else . She had made tea . " I 'm okay , really , " said Sidra . Everything she said about herself now sounded like a lie . If she was bad it sounded like a lie ; if she was fine -- also a lie . Her mother fiddled with a spoon . " I was envious of you . " Her mother sighed . " I was always so envious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , saying it softly at first and then shrieking . It was exactly like Sidra 's childhood : just when she thought life has become simple again , her mother gave her a new portion of the world to organize . " I have to go , " said Sidra . She had only just gotten there , but she wanted to go . She did n't want to visit her parents anymore . She did n't want to look at their lives . She went back to the Days Inn and phonmed Tommy . She and Tommy understood each other . " I ITLgetITL you , " he used to say . His childhood had been full of sisters . He 'd spent large portions of it drawing pictures of women in bathing suits -- Miss Kenya from Nairobi !  - -  and then asking one of the sisters to pick the most beautiful . If he disagreed , he asked another sister . The connection was bad , and suddenly she felt too tired . " Darling , are you okay ? " he said faintly . " I 'm okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I think I 'm hard of talking , " she said . " I 'll phone you tomorrow . " She phoned Walter instead . " I need to see you , " she said . " Oh , really ? " he said skeptically , and then added , with a sweetness he seemed to have plucked expertly from the air like a fly . " Is this a great country or what ? " She felt grateful to be with him again . " Let 's never be apart , " she whispered , rubbing his stomach . He had the physical inclinations of a dog : he liked stomach , ears , exited greetings . " Fine by me , " he said . " Tomorrow , let 's go out to dinner somewhere really expensive . My treat . " " Uh , " said Walter , " tomorrow 's no good . " " Oh . " " How about Sunday ? " " What 's wrong with tomorrow ? " " I 've got . Well , I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " " What 's second of all ? " " I 'm getting together with this woman I know . " " Oh ? " " It 's no big deal . It 's nothing . It 's not a date or anything . " " Who is she ? " " Someone whose car I fixed . Loose mountings in the exhaust system . She wants to get together and talk about it some more . She wants to know about catalytic converters . You know , women are afraid of getting taken advantage of . " " Really ! " " Yeah , well , so Sunday would be better . " " Is she attractive ? " Walter scrinched up his face and made a sound of unenthusiasm . " Enh , " he said , and placed his hand laterally in the air , rotating it up and down a little . Before he left in the morning , she said , " Just do n't sleep with her . " " Sidra , " he said , scolding her for lack of trust or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did n't come home . She phoned and phoned and then drank a six-pack and fell asleep . In the morning , she phoned again . Finally , at eleven o'clock , he answered . She hung up . At 11:30 , her phone rang . " Hi , " he said cheerfully . He was in a good mood . " So where were you all night ? " asked Sidra . This was what she had become . She felt shorter and squatter and badly coiffed . There was some silence . " What do you mean ? " he said cautiously . " You know what I mean . " More silence . " Look , I did n't call this morning to get into a heavy conversation . " " Well , then , " said Sidra , " you certainly called the wrong number . " She slammed down the phone . She spent the day trembling and sad . She felt like a cross between Anna Karenina and Amy Liverhaus , who used to shout from the fourth-grade cloakroom , " I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall Field 's to buy new makeup . " You 're much more of a cream beige than an ivory , " said the young woman working the cosmetics counter . But Sidra clutched at the ivory . " People are always telling me that , " she said , " and it makes me very cross . " She phoned him later that night and he was there . " We need to talk , " she said . " I want my key back , " he said . " Look . Can you just come over here so that we can talk ? " He arrived bearing flowers -- white roses and irises . They seemed wilted and ironic ; she leaned them against the wall in a dry glass , no water . " All right , I admit it , " he said . " I went out on a date . But I 'm not saying I slept with her . " She could feel , suddenly , the promiscuity in him . It was a heat , a creature , a tenant twin . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you know that ? " " Get a life ! What am I , an idiot ? " She glared at him and tried not to cry . She had n't loved him enough and he had sensed it . She had n't really loved him at all , not really . But she had liked him a lot ! So it still seemed unfair . A bone in her opened up , gleaming and pale , and she held it to the light and spoke from it . " I want to know one thing . " She paused , not really for effect , but it had one . " Did you have oral sex ? " He looked stunned . " What kind of question is that ? I do n't have to answer a question like that . " " You do n't have to answer a question like that . You do n't have any rights here ! " she began to yell . She was dehydrated . " You 're the one who did this . Now I want the truth . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw his gloves across the room . " Yes or no , " she said . He flung himself onto the couch , pounded the cushion with his fist , placed an arm up over his eyes . " Yes or no , " she repeated . He breathed deeply into his shirtsleeve . " Yes or no . " " Yes , " he said . She sat down on the piano bench . Something dark and coagulated moved through her , up from the feet . Something light and breathing fled through her head , the house of her plastic-wrapped and burned down to tar . She heard him give a moan , and some fleeing hope in her , surrounded but alive on the roof , said perhaps he would beg her forgiveness . Promise to be a new man . She might find him attractive as a new , begging man . Though at some point , he would have to stop begging . He would just have to be normal . And then she would dislike him again . He stayed on the sofa , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness in her cleaned her out , hollowed her like acid or a wind . " I do n't know what to do , " she said , something palsied in her voice . She felt cheated of all the simple things -- the radical calm of obscurity , of routine , of blah domestic bliss . " I do n't want to go back to L.A. , " she said . She began to stroke the tops of the piano keys , pushing against one and finding it broken -- thudding and pitchless , shiny and mocking like an opened bone . She hated , hated her life . Perhaps she had always hated it . He sat up on the sofa , looked distraught and false -- his face badly arranged . He should practice in a mirror , she thought . He did not know how to break up with a movie actress . It was boys ' rules : do n't break up with a movie actress . Not in Chicago . If she left him , he would be better able to explain it , to himself , in the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to sound imploring . " I know " was what he said , in a tone approximating hope , faith , some charity or other . " I know you might not want to . " " For your own good , " he was saying . " Might be willing ... " he was saying . But she was already turning into something else , a bird -- a flamingo , a hawk , a flamingo-hawk -- and was flying up and away , toward the filmy pane of the window , then back again , circling , meanly , with a squint . He began , suddenly , to cry -- loudly at first , with lots of ohs , then tiredly , as if from a deep sleep , his face buried in the poncho he 'd thrown over the couch arm , his body sinking into the plush of the cushions -- a man held hostage by the anxious cast of his dream . " What can I do ? " he asked . But his dream had now changed , and she was gone , gone out the window , gone , gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
