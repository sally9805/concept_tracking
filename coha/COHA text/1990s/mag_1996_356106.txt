You 're adding up the numbers again , trying to figure out how to pay the bills coming due , when a man from the bank calls with a message that seems too good to be true . That calculator you got as a free gift for opening your account was , er , flawed . It has been adding up your bills all wrong and leading you to underestimate how much is left in the checking account . You can pay what you really do owe without giving up the weekly movie . <P> A panel of five eminent economists delivered an equivalent message to the government last week . The U.S. cost of living , said the panel , for years has been going up more slowly than the hallowed Consumer Price Index would suggest . One result is that the U.S. economy has been healthier for the past 20-odd years than anybody realized . <P> Of more immediate urgency , the government has been paying out much more in benefits , and collecting less in taxes , than was necessary to protect citizens against inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. a long way toward balancing the budget by 2002 . The time would seem propitious for such a move , with a safely re-elected President facing a Congress dominated by Republican budget hawks , and both seeking ways to slow the growth of spending on entitlements such as Medicare and Social Security before a real crisis breaks . <P> To the Clinton Administration and congressional powers , however , the news from the commission seemed too true to be good . Changing the way inflation is measured would mean telling Social Security pensioners and veterans that their benefit checks wo n't rise as fast as they have expected . And telling some millions of union workers that their future pay raises may be smaller . And telling some 160 million taxpayers they will eventually have to hand over more to the Internal Revenue Service . Even telling members of the First Wives Club that their alimony and child-support payments will increase less rapidly . <P> What Congress member or Administration official dares inform these people that for years they have been getting more than they deserved ? " Everyone right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oz , pointing in both directions and looking to see who goes first , " says Ari Fleischer , spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee . " Clearly this reform will not be successful without President Clinton 's leadership , " says William Roth , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee . Clinton , however , has only asked his economic team to evaluate the report of that panel , which was headed by Michael Boskin of the Hoover Institution . <P> So rejiggering the CPI might be put aside for scholarly debate and perhaps glacial , piecemeal action  --  unless it becomes the last resort for producing a balanced budget . That could happen . Says New York Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan : " The seven-year balanced-budget plan of the President says in the final years there 's a 30% unspecified cut in discretionary , nondefense spending . Without the CPI change you could n't do that . " But even then Republicans and Democrats , Congress and the President , would all have to agree to join hands and jump together .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
