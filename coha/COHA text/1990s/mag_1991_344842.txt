Over the next few months , delicate negotiations will determine whether the world 's largest environmental meeting will produce real progress in saving the planet from man-made ruin . Or whether the session will merely add to global warming with hot-air emissions from about 100,000 parliamentarians , religious leaders , environmentalists and heads of state . <P> The occasion is the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , to be held in Rio de Janeiro next June . For two years , international committees have been hashing out a declaration of principles for the so-called Earth Summit . The bureaucrats have also been negotiating an ecologically sound agenda for the 21st century and a series of proposed agreements on the control of climate change , respect for biodiversity and a slowing of deforestation . But as the final negotiating sessions approach , U.S. intransigence on key issues means the summit may turn into little more than a biodegradable photo opportunity for heads of state . <P> The stakes are high . With carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere 25% above those in the 18th century , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to grips with the still unknown effects of global climate change caused by emissions of so-called greenhouse gases . Says Maurice Strong , secretary-general of UNCED : " This conference is an opportunity that may not occur again in our lifetime . When , if not at Rio , will we address these problems ? " <P> He might ask the Bush Administration . The U.S. is resisting pressure from the European Community and Japan to use the Rio conference as a forum to set targets and timetables for the reduction of warming gases , among other things . It has also resisted pressure to commit new funds so that developing economies can grow without destroying precious ecosystems . Washington 's posture stands in contrast to the leadership the U.S. exercised in 1972 at the U.N . Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm , which first established the environment as an area of international cooperation . Now , says James Gustave Speth , president of the Washington-based World Resources Institute , " our government is not accepting the responsibilities that come with the world 's largest economy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compact for a New World , " a proposed model for a way rich and poor nations might come to mutually beneficial agreements in Rio on the environment and development . Meeting in Washington last June , a group of activists , businessmen and politicians agreed that poorer southern nations would have an easier time accepting unpalatable initiatives on population stabilization , climate change and deforestation in return for a substantial quid pro quo . Its elements : debt forgiveness , direct financial aid to help end poverty , and technical help to reduce the poor nations ' role in global environmental problems . <P> This type of north-south bargain is also what the Rio conference should be all about . But while the U.S. seems to treat Rio 's emerging suite of agreements as a threat , other industrial nations see the Earth Summit as an opportunity . MITI , Japan 's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry , is developing a 100-year plan to make Japan dominant in eco- technologies ; Tokyo is also said to be pondering ways to become the world leader in environmental reform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
