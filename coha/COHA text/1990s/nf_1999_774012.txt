But the idea of shopping for a new car intimidated me far more than using the Internet to find the best deal in town . In fact , it was remarkably simple .

Once I got past the basic question of what model car I wanted , the site did all the work . Armed with Consumer Reports , dealer costs , leasing ver sus buying options , and dealer holdback information , I shopped for my new car at the site-sanctioned dealer who was obligated to honor the on-line price .

On-line Auctions While my on-line shopping habits have been relatively tame , my friend Rebecca , an art historian , has joined the bidding wars at on-line auctions . The eBay site , only a few years old , holds thirty-four million auctions each year , sell-48 ing everything from 1970s Mork and Mindy lunch boxes to farm equipment . Recently , after an important meeting with a university vice president about a rare , lucrative job possibil-ity , Rebecca began to question her own priorities . " What was I thinking while he was talking ? " she asked me . " About an eBay auction ending in minutes ! Before leaving for the meeting , I had placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depression-era print by Claire Leighton . I had to have it ! " Rebecca explained what on-line auction shoppers know : items frequently go to the last-minute bidder who bids for the first time just as the auction closes . " I was helpless ? I could find no decorous way to rush to the computer in the VP 's office to check on the status of my bid . It was awful . " " Well , " I asked , " did you get it ? " " Someone had snatched the print from my hands . But , at least , I got the job and a point-ed lesson in how to schedule meetings . Around eBay auc-lions , of course ! " Old , established auction houses are also developing Internet businesses . Sotheby 's hopes to attract " new clients who were n't comfortable cross-ing the threshold of our august establishments in the past , " according to its executive vice president , David Redden . 49 " You 'll be able to wander the halls of the most exalted gal-leries in the world and attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . Bidding on an item at an auction site can be as intimidat-ing as the first time you participate in a live auction . On-line , you can bid anytime , twenty-four hours a day , at what-ever sites you choose . You have instant access to an astounding array of categories . The components for auctions on-line are similar to live auctions : registration , bidding , selling , closing the transaction . But think before you hit that " Submit Bid " button . Do you really want the item ? If you have the high bid , you are entering into a legal agreement to buy . Some on-line auction sites , such as eBay , offer chat rooms for sharing interests with other buyers , as well as the opportunity to bid on items for sale . At eBay it is also possi-ble to record impressions of business transactions , so you can review other buyers ' experiences with a seller .

" Many on-line auction sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of auction sites through www.yahoo.com or other search engines . Search for " on-line auctions .

Print out the pages for your records and put them in a folder and label it with the auction site name . Take notes when you bid . Write down the details ; it will ease the final transac-tions . Avoid a frenzied bidding war during the auction time period ( usually a week ) . If you really must have that item , wait and place your maximum bid in the last hour of the auction .

Attributed to Muhammad the Prophet he markets of the world pulse with a rhythm unique to their culture and time . Some swagger and shout ; others buzz and hum . In certain places , a fre-netic energy ignites market activity . In others , merchants settle in for a long , languid day while incense wafts through the air . In this gathering of buyers and sellers , discover the heart and soul of any city ? its traditions and complexities . It 's here that people work , socialize , display their wares , demonstrate their skills , and bar-gain . It 's here that the Fearless Shopper can soak up the cul-ture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microcosm . To shop in a bazaar , a souk , or a Third World market is to feel the link with the first traders who bartered and sold along the Tigris and Euphrates , supplying the basics of the day ? weapons , food , beads , and cloth . Camel convoys moved goods from Africa , Asia , and Europe along trade routes that intersected in the Middle East . Traders brought silk from China , spices and perfumes from India , amber 52 from the north , and ivory from Africa . These ancient mar-kets spread via the Islamic tradition of the caravansaries ( the resting places on the early caravan routes ) and were the pre-cursors of modern city markets . Today , from Marrakech to Istanbul , Cairo to Samarkand , these bazaars are a shopper 's paradise and the places to bargain till you drop . I used to travel with a buyer who was masterful in these markets . She whirled from vendor to vendor in her long , flowing skirt and negotiated prices with dramatic gestures . She was especially effective in West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention a price , she would place her hand to her brow in a manner reminiscent of Scarlet O'Hara , feign fainting , gasp with horror , and pro-claim , " Oh , non , mon Dieu , c'est tres cher . " Then , she would name a rock bottom price as absurd as the merchant 's open-ing bid , and the fun would begin . The game went on until both sides were satisfied or a deal just was n't possible . Sometimes I 'd intervene , play the bad guy , or we would switch roles . If the negotiations lasted too long and only a few dollars or cents were at stake , it was time to move on . But the point is bargaining was fun and expected in all mar-kets . So , browse among the shopkeepers and craftspeople and , in the process , you 'll discover treasures that are more than you bargained for and valuable beyond the things you set out to find . Get the feel of the marketplace . Look around before you buy . In a foreign market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get better deals . 53 - Always bargain , and do it in a spirit of fun and friendliness . See the " Fearless Bargaining " chapter for a course in negotiating with the best of them . It 's easy to get dehydrated in a hot , dusty marketplace . Carry bottled water , and drink before you get thirsty . Make sure the top is sealed . If you have reason to be suspicious of the bottled water , buy the local cola or beer instead . Bring cash . Though some merchants may accept credit cards , you are in a better bargaining position if you have local currency U.S. dollars also help . If you want to buy more than one item , ask the price of one unit . Then bargain for quantity The small tokens you brought from home , such as pens , key chains , caps , or t-shirts , can be used to barter for an item that interests you , especially if the merchant has expressed an interest in them . Learn as many phrases and numbers as possible in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " too much " in any language . This will help you bargain with confidence . Ask permission to take photos of a stall or shopkeeper . If your purchase is a gift , you can use the photograph as a gift card . Buy traditional crafts . Before you go , learn what crafts a market is famous for , and research the craft technique . Go on educational craft-shopping vacations . There are groups that offer trips to visit artisans and craft markets in different countries . They will customize your trip , educate you about traditional crafts , and arrange meetings with indigenous groups from which you can purchase directly . See the " Resources and References " section for organizations . Be adventurous . If you are serious about buying and the merchant looks trustworthy , accept an invitation to see more goods behind the scenes , or ask to see other , more exclusive items that may be not be out . If you want a particular item from a country , bring pho-tographs with you from home and ask your hotel concierge or a market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a copy made . 55 - When shopping in dubious areas , you are vulnerable to hustlers and petty thieves . Instead of taking a map or guidebook with you , carry a local newspaper or magazine . You can clip photocopies of guidebook pages or your map to the inside of the journals , to appear less like a tourist . Only through the yoga of true pushiness , only by being relentlessly pushy in the most charming possible way , would I ever find the prize that l was seeking : a Buddha that really said something ; or , a Buddha that really said nothing ? and said it loudly enough for me to hear . Jeff Greenwald , Shopping for Buddhas // Necessity never made a good bargain . ? Benjamin Franklin wandered into a jewelry store in Hong Kong , peered into the narrow counter , and asked to see a Seiko watch . I knew the suggested retail price in the States was about $200 . I did n't really want to spend more than $100 , so when the merchant said $150 , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and handed it back . " Too much , " I said . " I only wanted to spend $100 . " " You from America ? " he asked . He wanted to know where , and what had brought me to Hong Kong . He chatted about everyday things and tried to interest me in other watches . " I really only like that one , but it 's too much . " I shrugged , thanked him , and walked out the door . Perhaps I even looked disappointed . He chased me down the street . A smile broadened his already wide face . " You my first customer of the day . First customer , last customer rule . Unlucky if I do n't make a sale . I sell it for $100 . " First customer , last customer ? I did n't even know I was bargaining . I bought it and realized that I got what I wanted because I was ready to walk away . Another time , after dinner in Bali , the grounds of my hotel transformed into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawking their handicrafts . I spotted batik cloth paintings and stopped to admire them . I chose two and asked the price of one . A slender young man with a broken tooth started to sell the merits of both . " Fifty dollars each , " he said . I must have looked like a rich tourist to him . They were n't worth more than twenty-five to me . " Too much . " I countered with an offer of twenty-five . " Thirty , " he said . " Too much . " I shrugged and walked away As I wandered away looking at other things and think ing about sleep , I felt a tap on my shoulder . He had followed me , the two batiks in his hands . " You are my last customer of the day , " he said . " I sell both for twenty-five dollars total . " First customer , last customer ? sometimes you get more than you bargained for . Two for the price of one ? how could I resist ? " I 'll take them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames I 'd put them in at home would cost far more . My dumb luck worked on these occasions , but often negotiating is more complicated . It 's a skill and one that the merchants have long perfected . But whether you are buying one souvenir or multiple items , it 's also fun . For the Smithsonian , we often dickered for hundreds . Because of our volume buying , we had an occasional behind-the-store front tour to select more goods . The quantity of our pur chases gave us leeway to haggle with the merchants . 58 Whatever the answer to our questions " Cuanto cuesta ? " or " Cambien ? " we inevitably said , " Too much . " After negotiations , depending on the country , we carted away any variety of goods ? wood carvings , jewelry , textiles , one-of-a-kind crafts ( all to be boxed and mailed later ) . Of course , we always thought that we got great bargains , but the truth is that merchants and shopkeepers have been at this game far longer . They know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm always reminded of the film Casablanca , where the merchant professes to give Ilsa a good price . He quickly drops his price , however , for " special friends of Rick 's , " leading one to ponder the intricacies of market negotiation and whom you know . We always tried to negotiate for the best deal even when prices were already good . It was part of the game . So enjoy it , but remember merchants are savvy bargain ers in any language ? even the young children . And they 're quick to size up tourists . Once in the Arab quarter of Jerusalem , I watched a young boy , no more than ten , try to interest a tourist in buying souvenirs . He addressed different customers , switching within seconds from Arabic to Hebrew , English , German , French , Spanish , and rattled off his prices . Merchants may not converse fluently in another language , but numbers are universal . Haggling does not mean harassing . Being pushy , rude , or belittling merchandise will not win you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This behavior does absolutely nothing for cultural understanding and global goodwill , " writes fearless bargainer Katie Cooney , author of 59 Window on the World : Straightforward Advice for Today 's Woman Traveler . " Be casual and polite when asking for prices and information , " she advises . " The more polite and respectful you behave , the chances are the same respect and kindness will be reciprocated . " Once you and a vendor have agreed on a price , it 's usually impolite to back out . You 've taken the merchant 's time , and reneging now is considered rude . Wait to bargain until you are ready to buy . If you feel pressured , you can always step outside the shop to think the deal over . In many countries , some items are negotiable and others are fixed . Such things as train and plane tickets , museum entrance fees , and safari tickets are usually considered set prices . But taxi rides , crafts , artwork , jewelry , clothes , rugs , and textiles are often negotiable . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's appropriate . It pays to get the feel of a market before you start to bar-gain ; check out the quality and pricing at other vendor stalls . Knowing the relative value of an item will help you decide how to counter a merchant 's offer . Bargaining is a game around the world ? a game of wit and skill and words . Bring your best poker face , and prepare for fearless entertainment . Before you bargain for anything , decide " What is this worth to me ? " Ask yourself , " What is the most I am willing to 60 pay ? " Then ask the price . That way you 'll know how much bargaining room you have . See what the locals are buying and paying . Try to avoid shopping during peak holiday or tourist seasons when demand often leaves little negotiating power . Learn numbers in other languages . If a merchant asks an absurd price , offer an equally ridiculously low price . You 'll probably meet somewhere in the middle . But if you start in the middle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay more than you should . Carry a calculator . Always ask . All anyone can ever do is say no . Often I 've asked for a discount for buying so much . Sometimes the clerk will laugh . And I always respond , " You 're laughing , and I 'm serious . " Sometimes that 's enough to get an extra ten percent off . Be willing to walk away . In bargaining , as in life , you can get what you want if you 're not attached to it . Time your purchases for that lucky first or last spot of the day . Maintain a sense of humor . 61 Advanced ( 3a , zgaining Many people think of bargaining as something to try in Morocco or Hong Kong , never in Western countries . But even in the U.S. , negotiating can work , including in stores that have " fixed " prices . This is especially true if you are spending a considerable amount . In a pleasant manner , always ask for a discount . If you are friendly and polite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boutiques , department stores , and chains , will extend one . Salespeople often have leeway for small price breaks ? ten percent ? to handle on-the-spot markdowns , but if a clerk can not make a large purchase discount decision , ask to speak to a manager or the owner . Rather than lose the sale , a merchant will often extend a courtesy dis count or mention a " special " for the month . In Europe , bargaining is more common than you 'd expect and fairly routine in small owner-operated stores , open-air markets , art galleries , and antique shops . In countries such as Portugal and Spain , and in Greece , Turkey , and various islands , paying the asking price is only for the uninitiated . Bargaining is accepted and , indeed , expected . And then there 's the matter of the " American price . " In 62 many parts of the world , prices of souvenirs are set higher for American tourists , since all Americans are considered wealthy . If you are American , and a vendor asks where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be making small talk . If you are aware of this practice , you can bargain accordingly Always bargain up from your price , never down from the merchant 's . Learn to be an actor . If something in a market is too expensive , act horrified . Do not be enthusiastic for or show much interest in the item you really want . Pretend you do n't care . Try bargaining first for something else that does n't interest you as much . Wander around , then start negotiating for what you really want . Let the vendor make the first offer , take your time before suggesting a counteroffer , or try silence . The offer may drop even before you respond . Do not budge from your highest price . But if you really want it , ask the merchant for his or her best price . In small luxury shops , polite bargaining works best . Instead of aggressive tactics , ask any of these gentler questions : " Is there a cash discount ? " " When will this item be on sale ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you give discounts for traveler 's checks ? " Do not be intimidated with aggressive bargaining , espe-cially in many Third World countries . Counter bold tactics with equal vigor . Remember , you can always walk away . When you are shopping abroad anywhere , ask , " Do you have a discount for foreigners ? " If an item might go on sale soon , ask a clerk to hold it for you or ask if you can get the sale price immediately . Ask for a discount at any store or market in the following circumstances : 64 for the last item on the shelf for buying an older model for a slight flaw that really does n't bother you ( but pretend that it does ) ? for paying in cash , checks , or traveler 's checks for various professions or memberships in certain organizations for buying more than one of the same thing for taking the floor or display sample off their hands ( Often you can get about twenty percent off , and many items still have a valid warranty ) If you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ask the merchant to throw another item into the bargain . Remind the merchant that you are helping them get rid of their inventory ? especially at the end of a season . To a small business owner that translates into immediate cash flow to buy new goods or pay bills . If something is too expensive , but you really want it , be indecisive . Pick it up , put it down , look at other things , ask lots of questions . Be persistent , but not demanding . 65 The more a shopkeeper has invested in time and the longer you can string out the negotiations , the more likely you will arrive at a good compromise . The merchant will want to convert that time to money in order to get on to the next customer . Bring duty-free lists and cat-alogs from home as a way to compare prices and know if you are really getting a bargain . Tell the shopkeeper what price you 'd pay for similar goods at home , if that will help with your negotiating . The sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the sale . Pull out just what you are willing to part with . In foreign countries , often pulling out dollars in a lesser amount will be acceptable . But in any currency , pull out less cash than asked for and try saying , " This is all I have on me . Will you take it ? " Enter into the bargaining only if you really want the item , and do n't leave behind something you really must have . 66 Many years ago , two brothers had a family clothing store on the Lower East Side of New York . The brother who waited on the customers wore a large hearing aid , while the other brother at the rear of the store was in charge of the books . After finding out a family wanted a blue suit for the son for the holidays , the brother in front would hold up the suit and shout to the brother at the rear , " Sam , how much is this blue suit ? " From the back , the reply , " Thirty-five dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " The price of the suit is twenty-five dollars . " Quickly the suit was wrapped and paid for , and the family left very satisfied . It is remarkable how many ' fifteen-dollar suits were sold in this way . Marsha Shaines , lawyer 67 Chapter eleven . FAIR TRADE Everyone lives by selling something , whatever be his right to it . ? Robert Louis Stevenson lies hung in the air and swarmed the alley . Like beads in a curtain , they momentarily blocked my way to a craft workshop . My Indian agents , who had brought me to this part of New Delhi , seemed oblivi ous . They walked straight through the passageway . I covered my mouth and nose with one hand , brushed aside the thick veil of flies with the other , and followed them . The alley opened into an airy courtyard where a dozen Indian women , clad in multi-colored saris , squatted over a wide , rectangular blanket on the stone ground . Babies hud-died to their bodies or sat beside them . Pieces of fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They hunched over the blanket and formed a makeshift assembly line to cut , paste , and sew . One cut , another stitched , others glued felt pieces to fabric . I came here to buy patch-cloth dolls and learn about tradi tional handicrafts . I watched as the women pasted eyes to cloth doll heads for a dollar a day . 68 The women seemed happy , and the government agency with whom we worked claimed the women received a good wage for their work , but I felt uncomfortable when I had to negotiate lower costs . The price the government wanted from us bore no relation to the wage these woman earned . If I got the agency to lower their wholesale price to us , would the women earn even less than one dollar ? I kept thinking that the Indian government was taking advantage of our sit uation . With only two weeks to cram in all our buying , we did n't have time to find other resources or learn about working conditions . In our limited time , we had to trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never clear even when we asked . And what was a fair share ? Judging worker salaries in Third World countries by Western standards was unrealistic . What would be a pittance in the West would feed many families in other parts of the world . We felt compelled to pay an equitable price based on the country 's own economic standards . Wherever possible , we bought from craftspeople rather than an intermediary so that they would benefit directly . We tried to be alert to exploit-ative conditions where artisans were treated poorly , had no ventilation , or appeared overworked . Seeing that would have prevented us from buying the products no matter how much money we might have saved . The problem , of course , is actually seeing the factories . Government-run stores say they represent the interests of 69 the artist , but some Third World countries are notoriously corrupt and irresponsible about worker conditions and wages . Importers and manufacturers may , in fact , pay their producers more than they would get from a local company , but unless you tour the workplaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , the closer you get to the source , the more likely you will be to promote fair trade and equi table standards . When traveling and shopping , take advantage of any opportunity that brings you into indigenous artisan homes and marketplaces . You 'll find unique buys and help sustain communities . My friend Gloria , an importer , believes in shopping as close to the source as possi-ble . She was purchasing cloth-ing in Nogales , Mexico , when she spotted a young woman behind the counter wearing a blouse that was more typical than anything found on the rack . She asked the young woman for a blouse exactly like that but was told the blouse came from the village and was not for retail sale . Gloria offered to pay the young woman for the blouse ? double .

Jonathan Rosenthal , executive director // As the Spanish proverb says , " He who would bring home the wealth of the Indies , must carry the wealth of the Indies with him . " So it is in traveling ; a man must carry knowledge with him , if he would bring home knowledge . ? Samuel Johnson While combing through dusty back rooms of an antique shop in New Delhi , India , I found a small wood-and-brass chest with hidden drawers . I thought I could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing room . Perfect . It needed no repairs and had an added bonus ? those neat , hidden compartments . I had no clue what I 'd put there , but what fun to think I could hide a treasure . Not being an antique maven , I also had no idea about the real worth of the chest , but I was with Francis , a savvy French businessman who had lived in India for the past twenty-five years . He knew the reputation of the dealer , and so I bargained a bit and got the chest for about $300 . ( I still do n't know what it was actually worth , but the price seemed fair to me . ) My unexpected find thrilled me . On a previous trip to India , I had purchased my requisite souvenirs , now I could hunt for old Indian treasures . My first mistake ? I had n't completely inspected the chest . Later at home when I was cleaning it up , I found a small brass plate that read , " Made in Germany " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece ; it still reminds me of rummaging through that old shop , but I thought I was purchasing native goods . However , buying a piece made outside the country was a minor mistake compared with my freight mishap . Because Francis exported merchandise all the time , I left the ship-ping arrangements to him , and because I was n't in a hurry , I assumed he would send it the cheapest way . Wrong . He sent it air freight . Not only did I have to drive two hours round-trip to the airport at home , I also had to shell out more than $300 to retrieve my bargain . When I asked him why not a slow boat , he said it might have gotten mildewed and warped . But if I had thought to ask how much the air freight was , I might never have pur-chased it in the first place . Obviously , we did n't communi-cate even though we were both speaking English .

In the United States , they are subject to duty when they arrive .

Everything imaginable was crammed into every available space . It was a soft sell , and negotiations were laid back . " Come here , lady , just one look , " merchants routinely beckoned in French .

Some are quiet ; others push . The souks in Marrakech are calm com pared with Marche Kermel and Marche Sandaga in Dakar , Senegal . Dakar markets are not for the weary or jet-lagged . Bleary-eyed , my colleagues and I struggled to focus on mar ket crafts in Dakar , our first stop on a three-week buying trip in Africa . Merchants tossed wares in front of our eyes , 98 shouting out prices and vying for our attention . Whenever we wanted quantities , word spread through the market , and the merchant 's friends and relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore it all and bargain on our own terms ? in French , of course . Our next stop was the more civilized Grand Marche in Bamako , Mali . This market and other West African trading centers are slower and move not in a frenetic pace but on " African time . " In the streets everyone walks slowly , in business people write slowly , at restaurants waiters pour drinks slowly , bring the check slowly . If you ever saw the Bertolucci film , The Sheltering Shy , you understand African time . In Bamako , we found treasures along its dusty , red-clay streets . I was heartbroken to learn recently that the Grand Marche ? a medieval , covered market where my Smithsonian colleagues and I had purchased so many crafts ? had burnt down in the mid-nineties . While the market undergoes renovation , the vendors have spread out their wares along the street where you can shop for handicrafts , observe the scene , and soak up the culture . Women carrying bundles ? textiles , assorted fruit ? on their heads saunter down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensuous deliberation and a model 's posture . ( Back at the hotel I had practiced walking down the halls with books on my head to emulate their carriage , but to no avail . ) The pace and path of life here is loose and meandering like the men in regal , billowing robes and dashikis who glide down unpaved streets and greet each other with warm words and smiles . Some of them and children trade goods while others carry home live chickens and guinea hens upside down by holding onto their bound feet . Women sit or squat selling pineapples , bananas , or bolts of fabric on 99 the sidewalk . Bicycles , motorbikes , cars , wagons , and pedestrians stream by as if in a slow dance . Savor the atmosphere as you negotiate for gifts and souvenirs . Brush up on your high school French , the common lan guage in most of the West African markets , though English If time permits , visit individ ual villages away from the main cities where you can often buy directly from the artisans . Prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably better . As always , buy what you love ; but , the symbols and pat terns of many West African crafts have special meaning and function . So , to appreciate your purchases beyond their basic design , learn about each country 's craft traditions , religious symbols , and tribal usage before you visit . Masks , textiles , body accessories , gold weights , Dogon doors , musi cal instruments , kitchen tools , fertility dolls , and headrests all have functional or ceremonial purpose in daily life and are available in the markets . Wander lively markets in Bamako ( Mali ) , Dakar ( Senegal ) , Abidjan ( COte d'Ivoire ) , Lome ( Togo ) , Kano ( Nigeria ) , Ouagadougou ( Burkina Faso ) , and Niamey ( Niger ) for the widest selection of indigenous crafts . 100 101 14k or 925 silver . Nonetheless , these are usually good buys . Look for bargains in malachite jewelry . Brass , cowrie shell , and leather bracelets are plentiful and make fun accessories and inexpensive souvenirs . Traditional textiles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make wonderful gifts and decorative art . Bargain hard for these in the markets . Printed African cloth is sold by the yard or meter in local stores . The designs are both contemporary and tradition al . The cheaper cloth is of African origin . The more expensive and better quality printed cloths are imported from Holland , which local women buy also . The cloth makes a great souvenir if you sew clothes or home acces-sories , but the prices on the imports are pretty firm . A shopkeeper may extend a small discount of 10 percent when you bargain , but do n't expect much . Even if you do n't sew , it 's fun to wander into the shop just to see the bolts of cloth crammed into every shelf and stacked to the ceiling . 102 Bring home a bit of the local culture . Purchase native music on cassettes in many local stores . All the old , valuable crafts or museum-quality pieces are long gone . Be aware of sellers trying to pass off new crafts as old . It is common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then bury it in the ground so that it is caked in dirt to appear old . If you do stumble across a valuable artifact , you may have trouble getting it out of the country because authentic art may not be exported . In Ghana or Nigeria , you may need museum permission to remove an art object that looks old . Have the seller give you a written money-back guarantee if the export of your purchase is rejected . Rarely will you get a receipt in the markets , but you may need to show proof of your purchase to a customs official when you leave the country . Write up your own receipt in a notebook , and ask the vendor to sign his name or stamp it . Bribery is common in many West African countries . You may even be subject to a body search . Be firm in your refusal ; but , if you are trying to get your purchases through customs to another West African country and encounter too much diffi culty , offer a small gift to the official ? local currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry a book or two . Trying to get out of any land-locked West African country is like being pregnant and overdue . You know it will happen eventually , you just do n't know when . Flights leave erratically and only on certain days . There are few shops at the airports , and you are not likely to find much to do . You spend time just waiting ? perfect for reading . 103 Carved wooden objects may be infested with insects . Usually a trail of white powder around an object or bore holes are a good clue . Even if you do n't see these telltale signs , as a precaution , try these solutions at home : put the items in a plastic bag with mothballs or freeze the items for three to four weeks , nuke the pieces in the microwave , or pour lighter fluid over them .

Henry Miller As I was leaving India , I passed through the security gate at the Delhi airport . The electronic system never worked so I waited for the inevitable body and bag search . A short , middle-aged guard pulled me aside and ran her too-friendly hands all over my body . Next , an imperious Indian man took charge . " Open your bag , " he commanded . Though he was dressed in a drab-green uniform and black boots , I imagined this security guard ? shirtless with billowing pantaloons ? a bouncer outside Ali Baba 's den of thieves . Polished and buffed , his bald head shone burntcopper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle of an umbrella . He peered at me through sunken , midnight-black eyes . Not wanting to upset him , I unzipped my shoulder bag . He hunched his massive body over my bag and extracted ordinary things : an eyeglass case , books , pens , camera , a travel journal , lipstick , eye shadow , my Smithsonian business cards , a calculator , chocolate-chip granola bars , moisturizer , a contact lens case , eye-drops , a minitissue packet . More things . Engrossed , he examined everything one-by-one , holding 126 each piece up to the light , turning it this way and that , then setting it aside in a growing pile . What could he think ? How did I ht all that in there ? When will this end ? Still his hands searched and revealed more . Uncomfortable , I shifted my weight from leg to leg and waited for this prolonged agony to end . Exposed , I felt my personality unraveling piece by piece . Soon he would know more about me than my boyfriend . What 's he going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide-angle lens , his eyes scanned my bag for the smallest detail . This man took his job seriously . The silence was too much . I needed contact , a little comic relief . " Do you have any idea how embarrassing this is ? " I asked . He held my gaze . A grin widened slowly across his face . " Do n't worry , " he said . " I 've seen worse . " Like my shoulder bag , India is a cultural blend of so many stored things . You never know what you 'll find as you dig . From inexpensive souvenirs to esoteric art , you 'll discover not only an amazing array of products , but also an exotic and ancient culture . Keep your eyes open because images rush by in a blur ? fragments of a civilization with 4,000 years of history ? too fast to absorb fully .

Wide , inverted , cone-shaped mounds of powdered dyes and spices covered tables and blankets on the ground . 127 Smoke and scents rose in the air from food merchant carts . Colorful glass , bangle bracelets and silver nose and toe rings jangled from market vendors as they hawked their goods . Puppets and mechanical animals danced in the streets . On one buying trip , we visited the home of jewelers . Two brothers draped in white cotton tunics showed us their rooftop garden ( a sign of wealth ) , offered us tea , and brought out trays of sparkling gems : rubies , garnets , sapphires , emeralds . They delighted in showing us their expensive treasures , but since we did not have high-paying customers back home , we selected only affordable garnet necklaces .

Steeped in a rich tradition of crafts , India offers the Fearless Shopper opportunities to purchase a bit of history , culture , and entertainment . Shopping the streets is where the fun begins in any Asian country but , particularly , in India . Bring cash and be ready to negotiate for everything from spices and glass bangles to brass gods and dancing toys . 128 Bargain freely in Asian street markets and with sidewalk hawkers , but this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thumb , when you haggle in the mar-kets , offer half the original price and work your way up . While bargaining is a normal part of life in many Asian countries , remember that a few extra nickels or dimes are more likely to help your adversary than hurt you . So , bargain with a bit of compassion if you 're dealing with an artisan . In Asian countries , taxi drivers and locals who befriend you may offer to take you to reputable stores . There is nothing wrong with this if you see something you like , but you are not obligated to buy if you do n't want anything . Merchants may give commissions to " friends " who bring you to specific shops . If you purchase an item , you will probably be absorb-ing the cost of the " friend 's " commission .

If you live in New 129 York City , for example , you can probably get cheaper Japanese electronic equipment on 42nd Street than you can in Japan or Hong Kong . In China and Japan , watch out for misleading sizes . A medium t-shirt I bought in a store in Tokyo fit like a small . An extra-large in China is often equivalent to a medium in the U.S. Check your receipts for accuracy before leaving a store . Keep them handy for customs and any possible return problems .
