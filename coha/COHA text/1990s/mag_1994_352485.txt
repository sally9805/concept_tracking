It is a crisis that few in the emergency room are equipped to handle . Concerned friends have just arrived with a frightened man in his 20s . He is not bleeding . Nothing 's broken . Yet he can not stop crying , and his companions are worried that he might kill himself . Is he just having a bad night , or is he likely to do himself harm ? When it comes to determining an individual 's desire to commit suicide , physicians rely heavily on experience and intuition . There has never been a laboratory test that doctors could order that would help them measure the risk more precisely . <P> That predicament seems likely to change in the next few years , as scientists learn more about the biochemistry of behavior . Some of the latest research  --  parts of which were presented at last week 's meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in Miami  --  suggests that measuring the levels of certain chemicals in the brain can identify those people with a biological predisposition to self-destruction . " More than 95% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain ( ( at autopsy ) ) , " says Dr. John Mann of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City . " But the biochemical abnormality is there even in those who attempt to kill themselves . And it is most pronounced in those who make the most dangerous attempts . " <P> A lab test for suicide  --  the eighth leading cause of death in the U.S.  --  sounds incredible . Yet it is only one of the promising developments being pursued in the hot new field of biological psychiatry . What was once the purview of priests and analysts , who try to probe the mind by listening and observing , is now a frontier for neuroscientists , who use blood tests , brain scans and spinal taps . Psychiatrists at some research centers are already using these tools to distinguish among types of depression and schizophrenia , and predict with some degree of certainty the best course of treatment for their patients . <P> There have been setbacks . Despite compelling evidence that manic depression , a mental illness characterized by extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated the genes responsible for the disorder . Several candidates have been identified , only to be discarded . But while the geneticists have hit a snag , the brain chemists are moving faster than anyone thought possible , and have produced an impressive array of practical results . <P> Nowhere is this bonanza more apparent than with the research into the brain chemical called serotonin . One of the many signaling chemicals used by nerve cells to communicate with one another , serotonin is intricately linked to those parts of the brain that affect mood and impulse control . Nerve cells manufacture , release and absorb serotonin in quick bursts that ripple throughout the cerebrum . Although no one understands quite why , low levels of the chemical are associated with clinical depression . As a result , serotonin has become the target for a whole new genre of antidepressant drugs  --  the most popular of which is Prozac  --  that keep it active in the brain longer than usual .                    @
