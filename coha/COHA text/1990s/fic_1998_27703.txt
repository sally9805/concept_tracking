THE FIRST SCROLL 1 Warmth . Wind . Dancing blue waters , and the sound of waves . I see , hear , feel them all still . I even taste the sting of the salt against my lips , where the fine , misty spray coats them . And closer even than that , the lulling , drowsy smell of my mother 's skin by my nose , where she holds me against her bosom , her hand making a sunshade across my forehead to shield my eyes . The boat is rocking gently , and my mother is rocking me as well , so I sway to a double rhythm . It makes me very sleepy , and the sloshing of the water all around me makes a blanket of sound , wrapping me securely . I am held safely , cradled in love and watchfulness . I remember . I remember ... And then ... the memory is torn apart , upended , overturned , as the boat must have been . My mother gone , and I tumbling through the air , caught by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my middle that I can hardly breathe . And the splashing ... I can still hear the splashing , hear the brief , surprised cries . They say I could not possibly , that I was not yet three years old when my mother drowned in the harbor , terrible accident , and on such a calm day , how did it ever happen ? was the boat tampered with ? did someone push ? no , she just tripped and fell in while trying to stand up , and you know she could n't swim , no , we did n't know that , until it was too late , why then did she go out on the water so often ? She liked it , poor soul , poor Queen , liked the sound and the colors ... A bright blue ball seems to envelop all that terror , that thrashing and the arcs of water flying all over , a sweeping circle , and thescreams of the ladies on the boat . They say that someone dived over to help and was dragged down , too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I clawed and kicked and tried to fling myself after my mother , screaming in fear and loss , but my strong-armed nurse , who had caught me , held me fast . I remember being pushed onto my back and being held flat , staring up at the underside of a canopy where dazzling blue water was reflected , and unable to throw off my captor 's hands . No one comforts me , as one would expect someone to do for a frightened child . They are too concerned with preventing me from escaping . They say I can not remember that either , but I do . How exposed I feel , how naked on that boat bench , torn from my mother 's arms and now forcibly held down , as the boat hurries for shore . Some days later I am taken to a large , echoing room , where light seems to come in from all sides and wind sweeps through , too . It is a room , but it feels as if it is also outdoorsa special sort of room , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god . It is the temple of Isis , and the nurse is leading me to a huge statuepulling me , rather . I remember digging in my heels and having to be almost dragged across the shiny stone floor . The base of the statue is enormous . I can barely see over the top of it , to where two white feet seem to be , and a figure standing above it . The face is lost in shadow . " Put your flowers at her feet , " the nurse is saying , tugging at my fist with the flowers I am clutching . I do n't want to let go of them , do n't want to put them there . " This is Isis , " the nurse says gently . " Look at her face . She is watching you . She will take care of you . She is your mother now . " Is she ? I try to see the face , but it is so high and far away . It does not look like my mother 's face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slowly I lift my hand and put my little offering on the pedestal at the end of my reach . I look up again , hoping to see the statue smile , and I imagine that I do . So , Isis , it is thus , and on that day , I became your daughter . 2 My mother the late Queen 's name was Cleopatra , and I was proud to bear her name . But I would have been proud of it in any case , for it is a great name in the history of our family , going all the way back to the sister of Alexander the Great , to whom we Ptolemies are related . It means " Glory to her Ancestry , " and all my life and reign I have tried to fulfill that promise . All that I have done , I have done to preserve my heritage and Egypt . All the women in our line were named Cleopatra , Berenice , or Arsinoe . Those names , too , went all the way back to Macedonia , where our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received the names of Cleopatra ( yes , there were two of us ) and Berenice , and my younger sister the name of Arsinoe . Younger sister ... there were others after me . For the King needed to marry again , and soon after the untimely death of his Queen Cleopatra , he took a new wife , and she straightway produced my sister Arsinoe . Later she gave birth to the two little boys to whom I was briefly " married . " Then she died , leaving Father a widower again . This time he did not remarry . I did not care for my father 's new wife , nor for my sister Arsinoe , who was only a little more than three years younger than 1 . From her earliest days she was sly and deceitful , a whiner and complainer . It did not help that she was also quite beautifulthe kind of child that everyone exclaims over , and asks , " And where did she come by those eyes ? " and not merely out of politeness . It gave her an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a gift to be appreciated but as a power to be used . My sister Cleopatra was some ten years older than 1 , and Berenice eight . Fortunate sisters , to have had our mother for that many years longer than I ! Not that they seemed to be grateful for it . The eldest was a dour , drooping sort of creature ; I fear I can not even recall her very well . And Bereniceshe was a veritable bull of a woman , big-shouldered , raw voiced , with wide , flat feet that made even normal walking sound like stamping . There was nothing about her to recall our ancestor , the delicate-featured Berenice II , who had reigned with Ptolemy III two hundred years earlier and passed into legend as a strong-willed beauty to whom court poets dedicated their works . No , the red-faced , snorting Berenice would never inspire such literary outpourings . I basked in the knowledge that I was my father 's favorite . Do not ask me how children know these things , but they do , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I found the other Cleopatra and Berenice to be so peculiar that I could not imagine anyone being partial to them rather than to me . But later , even after Arsinoe with all her beauty came along , I retained the leading place in my father 's heart . I know now it was because I was the only one who showed any concern for him in return . I must admit it , honestly but with reluctance : The rest of the world ( including his own children ) found Father either comical or pitifulperhaps both . He was a handsome , slight man , with a diffident and dreamy manner that could turn quickly to nervousness when he felt threatened . People blamed him both for what he himself wasan artist by inclination , a flute player , and a dancerand for the situation he had inherited . The first was his own doing , but the second was an unfortunate legacy . It was not his fault that by the time he managed to climb onto the throne , it was practically in the jaws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . These included groveling , flattering , jettisoning his brother , paying colossal bribes , and entertaining the hated potential conquerors at his very court . It did not make him loved . Nor did it make him secure . Was it any wonder that he sought escape with the wine and music of Dionysus , his patron god ? But the more he sought it , the more disdain he reaped . Father 's Magnificent Banquet for Pompey the Great : I was almost seven then , and eager finally to see Romans , real Romans , the Romans ( that is , the dangerous ones , not the harmless merchants or scholars who showed up in Alexandria on personal business ) . I pestered Father to let me attend , knowing well how to persuade him , since he was susceptible to almost everything I asked , within reason . " I want to see them , " I told him . " The famous Pompeywhat does he look like ? " Everyone had trembled about Pompey , since he had just swooped down on our part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion in Pontus , then he had continued into Syria and taken the remnants of the empire of the Seleucids , turning it into a Roman province . A Roman province . The whole world was turning into a Roman province , so it seemed . For a long time , Romewhich was located far away , on the other side of the Mediterraneanhad confined itself to its own area . Then gradually it had extended its grasp in all directions , like the arms of an octopus . It grabbed Spain to the west , and Carthage to the south , and then Greece to the east , swelling and swelling . And the larger it swelled , the more its appetite grew to feed its bulk . Little kingdoms were just morsels to ittidbits like Pergamon and Caria , easily swallowed . The ancient realms of Alexander would be more satisfying , stave off its hunger better . Once there had been three kingdoms carved out of Alexander 's domains , ruled by his three generals and their descendants : Macedonia , Syria , and Egypt . Then two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt . There were reports that the Romans now felt the time was ripe to annex Egypt as well , and that Pompey himself was particularly keen on it . So Father had decided to do everything in his power to buy Pompey off . He sent cavalry units to help Pompey in crushing his next victim , our nearest neighbor , Judaea . Yes , it was shameful . I admit it . No wonder his own people hated him . But would they rather have fallen to the Romans ? His choices were those of a desperate man , between bad and worse . He chose bad . Would they have preferred worse ? " He 's a big , strapping man , " Father said . " Not unlike your sister Berenice ! " We laughed together at that , conspirators . Then the laughter died . " He 's frightening , " he added . " Anyone with that much power is frightening , no matter how charming his manners . " " I want to see him , " I insisted . " The banquet will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and boring for you . There 's no point to it . Perhaps when you are older " " I hope you never have to entertain them again , so this is my only chance , " I pointed out to him . " And if they do ever come here again , it wo n't be under pleasant circumstances . No lavish banquets then . " He looked at me oddly . Now I know it was because it was a strange way for a seven-year-old to speak , but then I was just afraid he was displeased with me and was going to refuse me permission . " Very well , " he finally said . " But I expect you to do more than just stare . You must be on your best behavior ; we have to convince him that both Egypt and Rome are well served by our remaining on the throne . " " We ? " Surely he did not mean ... or did he ? I was only the third child , although at that point I had no brothers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the hope that had briefly flared up in me . My First Banquet : Every royal child should be required to write a rhetorical exercise with that title . For banquets play such an inordinately large part in our lives ; they are the stage where we act out our reigns . You start out dazzled by them , as I was then , only to find that after a few years they all run together . But this one will remain forever engraved in my mind . There was the ( soon to become dully routine ) act of dressing , the first stage in the ritual . Each princess had her own wardrobe mistress , but mine was actually my old nurse , who knew little about clothes . She outfitted me in the first dress from the stack ; her main concern was that it be freshly laundered and ironed , which it was . " Now you must sit still , so it wo n't wrinkle , " she said , smoothing out the skirt . I remember that it was blue , and rather stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that romping , none of that acting like a boy that you sometimes do , not tonight ! Tonight you must behave like a princess . " " And how is that ? " I felt as encased as a mummy in its wrappings , which were also usually of linen . Perhaps going to the banquet was not such a good idea after all . " With dignity . When someone speaks to you , you turn your head around , slowly . Like this . " She gave a demonstration , letting her head swivel smoothly around , then lowering her eyelids . " And you look down , modestly . " She paused . " And you answer in a sweet , low voice . Do not say , " What ? ' Only barbarians do that . The Romans might well do it , " she said grimly . " But you must not follow their example ! " She fussed with my collar a little , straightening it . " And should anyone be so rude as to mention an unpleasant subjectlike taxes or plague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss such things at a banquet . " " What if I see a scorpion about to sting someone ? Suppose , right on Pompey 's shoulder , there 's a bright red scorpion , its stinger raisedcan I tell him ? " I must learn all the rules . " Would n't it be rude not to ? Even though it 's an unpleasant subject ? " She looked confused . " Well , I suppose " She snorted . " There wo n't be a scorpion on Pompey 's shoulder ! Honestlyyou are an exasperating child , always thinking of something like that . " But she said it affectionately . " At least we should hope there is n't a scorpion to bother Pompey , or anything else to ruin his good mood . " " Should n't I wear a diadem ? " I said . " No , " she said . " Where did you get that idea ? You are n't a queen . " " Are n't there any for princesses ? We should be able to wear something on our heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so do athletes . " She cocked her head , as she did when she was thinking hard . " I think the best ornament for a young girl is her hair . And you have such pretty hair . Why spoil it with anything else ? " She was always very attentive to my hair , rinsing it in scented rainwater and combing it with ivory combs . She taught me to be proud of it . But I longed to wear something special tonight . " But there should be something to mark us out as the royal family . My sisters " " Your sisters are older , and it is appropriate for them . When you are seventeen , or even fifteen like Berenice , you can wear such things . " " I suppose you are right . " I pretended to agree . I let her comb my hair and pull it back with a clasp . Then I said , " Now that my forehead is so barenot even a fillet ? " A small , discreet one , a narrow bandyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Child , child , child ! Why are you not content to let things rest ? " But I could see that she was going to relent . " Perhaps a very small gold one . But I want you to use it as a reminder , the whole evening , that you are a princess . " " Of course , " I promised . " I wo n't do anything rude , and even if a Roman belches or spills or steals a gold spoon by hiding it in his napkin , I 'll pretend I do n't see . " " You may well see some spoon-stealing , " she admitted . " They are so hungry for gold , they drool at its sight . It 's a good thing the artworks in the palace are too big to be tucked into the fold of a toga , or some of them would be missing come morning . " I had been in the banqueting hall before , but only when it was empty . The enormous chamber , which stretched from one side to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace buildings on the royal grounds ) and opened onto steps overlooking the inner harbor , had always seemed like a shiny cavern to me . Its polished floors reflected my image when I ran across it , and the rows of pillars showed me passing . High above , the ceiling was lost in shadow . But tonight ... the cavern was ablaze with light , so much so that for the first time I could see , far above , the cedar beams overlaid with gold that ran the length of the ceiling . And the noise ! The sound of a crowdwhich was to become so familiar to meassaulted my ears like a blow . The whole chamber was packed with people , so many people that I could only stop and stare at them . Wethe royal familywere standing at the top of a small set of steps before entering the room , and I wanted to take my father 's hand and ask him if all the thousand guests were here . But he was standing in front of me , the place beside him occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We waited for the trumpets to sound , announcing our entrance . I watched intently , trying to see what Romans looked like . Which ones were the Romans ? About half the people were wearing the common sort of loose-flowing garments , and some of those men had beards . But the others ... they were clean-shaven , with short hair , and they were wearing either a voluminous sort of draped cape ( which looked like a bedsheet to me ) , or else military uniforms , made up of breastplates and little skirts of leather strips . Obviously those were Romans . The others must be Egyptians and Greeks from Alexandria . The trumpets blasted , but from the other end of the hall . Father did not stir , and soon I saw why : The trumpets were heralding the entrance of Pompey and his aides . As they filed toward the center of the chamber , I beheld the full regalia of a Roman general of the highest order , in which the plain breastplate of the soldier was replaced by one of pure gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple , not red , and he wore some sort of special enclosed boots . It was altogether splendid to look upon . Pompey himself ? I was disappointed to see that he was just a man , with a rather bland face . There was nothing about him as dazzling as his uniform . On each side of him were other officers , their faces harder and more set than his , and they served as a frame to set him apart . Now a second set of trumpets sounded , and it was our turn to descend , so that Father could greet his guests and welcome them officially . All eyes were upon him as he carefully stepped down , his royal robe trailing behind him . I made sure not to trip on it . The two men stood face-to-face ; Father was so much shorter and smaller ! Next to the husky Pompey , he looked almost frail . " You are most welcome to Alexandria , most noble Imperator Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus . We greet you , and salute your victories , and declare that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Father . He had a pleasant voice , and normally it carried well , but tonight it lacked power . He must be terribly , terribly nervousand of course that made me nervous , too , and nervous for him as well . Pompey gave some reply , but his Greek was so accented I could hardly understand him . Perhaps Father did ; at least he pretended to . More exchanges followed , many introductions on both sides . I was presentedor was Pompey presented to me ? Which was the proper order ? and I smiled and nodded to him . I knew that princesseslet alone kings and queens ! never bowed to anyone else , but I hoped it would not offend him . He probably did not know all these things , being from Rome , where they had no kings . Instead of his previous responsea tepid smilehe suddenly bent down and stared right into my face , his round blue eyes just level with mine . " What an enchanting child ! " he said , in that odd Greek . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He turned to Father , who looked embarrassed . I could tell he regretted allowing me to come ; he did not wish to do anything that might call unflattering attention to us . " Not until the age of seven , " he improvised quickly . I was n't quite seven yet , but Pompey would never know . " We believe that that age is the portal to understanding .... " Tactfully he indicated that the banquet tables were waiting , in the adjoining , almost equally large , chamber , and steered the Roman commander in that direction . Beside me , my older sisters were smirking ; they seemed to find my discomfiture amusing . " What an enchanting child , ' " Berenice mimicked . " Look , there 's another one , " the elder Cleopatra said , indicating a boy who was watching us pass . " The banquet is turning into a children 's party ! " I was surprised to see him , and I wondered why he was there . He looked completely out of place . Would Pompey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed more interested in getting to the food in the next room . Everyone said Romans were most fond of eating . The boy , who was dressed as a Greek and holding the hand of a bearded , Greek-looking man , must be an Alexandrian . He was studying us the way I had studied the Romans . Perhaps we were a curiosity to him . Our family did not make many public appearances in the streets of Alexandria , for fear of riots . We walked slowly , andI hopedmajestically past him , and entered the transformed room where we would dine . Some late afternoon rays of sun were stabbing almost horizontally across the chamber , just at the level of the tables , where a forest of gold goblets and dishes was waiting . It seemed like magic to me , lighted up like that , and it must have to the Romans , too , because they were all laughing with delight , and pointing . Pointing ! How rude ! But then ... I had been warned to expect it . Pompey was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even look particularly interested ; or if he was , he hid it well . We took our places ; all the adults were to recline , while only the lesser folk would sit on stoolsand there were very few lesser folk present . My nurse had told me that in Rome both women and children were relegated to the stools , but neither the Queen nor the older princesses would ever tolerate that here . I tried to figure out how many couches were needed for a thousand people to recline , and knew it was over three hundredand yet they fitted into this enormous room , with ample room left over for the servers to pass between them easily with their trays and dishes . Father was motioning me to a stool , while Pompey and his companions spread themselves on the couches clustered for the highest of the high . Was I to be the only one on a stool ? I might as well have worn a huge sign calling attention to myself . I watched while my sisters and stepmother settled themselves , daintily twitching their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wished I were only a little older , and could be on a couch ! I felt myself to be so conspicuous that I wondered how I would ever get through the meal . Just then Father ordered the bearded man with the boy to join us ; I saw him sending for them . I knew he was doing it to alleviate my embarrassment ; he was always very solicitous of others , seeming to sense their distress even if they did not voice it . " Ah ! My dear Meleagros , " Father addressed the man . " Why not seat yourself where you can learn what you wish ? " The man nodded , seemingly unperturbed at being assigned to our exalted midst . He must be a philosopher ; they were supposed to take all things with equanimity . And of course the beard confirmed it . He propelled his son forward , pushing him before him , and a stool was quickly brought for him . Now there were two of us . I suppose Father thought that would make it easier . Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of our scholars , " explained Father . " He is at " " Yes , the Museion , " said a square-faced Roman . " That 's where you keep the tame scholars and scientists , right ? " Without waiting for an answer , he poked his companion in the ribs . " They live there , but then they have to work for the King . Whenever he wants to know somethingoh , say , how deep the Nile is near Memphishe can just summon someone to tell him , even in the middle of the night ! Right ? " Meleagros stiffened ; he looked as though he wanted to smack the Roman . " Not exactly , " he said . " It is true that we are supported by the generosity of the Crown , but our King would never be so thoughtless as to make such outrageous demands on us . " " In fact , " said Father , " I have brought him here in order that he might question you , Varro . Meleagros is most interested in unusual plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been observing and collecting near the Caspian Seaafter you ran Mithridates off , that is . " " Yes , " the man called Varro admitted . " We were hoping to learn more about a reputed trade route to India by way of the Caspian Sea . But Mithridates was not the only one to be run offso were we , by deadly snakes . I never saw so manyall different sorts , too . Of course , what can you expect , at the edge of the known world like that " " The geography there is puzzling , " one of the other men said , a Greek-speaker . Someone addressed him as Theophanes . " It is difficult to map " " You have maps ? " Meleagros looked interested . " Newly drawn . But perhaps you would like to see them ? " And so on . The polite conversation continued . The boy by my side was silent , just looking . What was he doing here ? The wine flowed , and the talking grew louder , more animated . The Romans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What an odd , monotonous sound it had if you did not understand it . And I had not studied it . There was little to recommend it ; nothing important was written in it , and there were no famous speeches in it . Other languages , such as Hebrew , Syriac , and Aramaic , were much more useful . And lately I had even decided to try to learn Egyptian , so that I could go anywhere in my country and understand the people . But Latin ? That could wait . I watched my sisters , who were hardly bothering to hide their disdain for the Romans ; when the conversation fell back into Latin , Berenice and Cleopatra just rolled their eyes . I was worried about it ; what if the Romans saw them ? I thought we were supposed to be careful about giving offense . Suddenly trumpets sounded and an array of servers appeared , as if from out of the walls , and snatched the gold vessels away , replacing them with more gold vessels , even more heavily engraved and jeweled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed they were meant to . But what was the point ? Why was Father so anxious to show off our wealth ? Would it not make them want to appropriate it ? This confused me . I saw Pompey looking dreamily at the enormous cup before him , as if he were visualizing melting it down . And then I heard the word Caesar , and it was linked with something to do with greed and needing money . I thought Pompey was saying to FatherI strained very hard to overhearthat Caesar ( whoever he was ) had wanted to take Egypt and make it into a Roman province , since it had been willed to Rome .... " But the will was false , " Father was saying , and his voice sounded as high as a eunuch 's . " Ptolemy Alexander had no right even to make such a bequest " " Ha , ha , ha ! " Pompey was saying . " That depends on who is interpreting " " So you are intending to be a scientist , too ? " Theophanes was speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that why you came with your father ? " Curses ! Now I could not hear what Father and Pompey were saying , and it was terribly important . I tried to blank out the voice right beside me , but it was hopeless . " No , " the boy said , his voice drowning out the ones farther away . " Although I am interested in botany and in animals , I am more interested in the most complex animal of all : man . I wish to study him , therefore I will be a physician . " " And what is your name ? " asked Theophanes as if he were really interested . " And your age ? " " Olympos , " he said , " and I am nine . Ten next summer ! " Oh , be quiet ! I ordered him in my mind . But Theophanes kept asking him questions . Did he live at the Museion , too ? Was he interested in any special sort of medicine ? What about pharmakon , drugs ? That was a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , " Olympos was saying . " I was hoping I could ask some of you about the mad honey . ' That 's really why I came tonight . Or persuaded my father to bring me , I should say . " Theophanes lost his smile . " The mad honeymeli maenomenondo n't ask Pompey about it . It grieves him still . You see , the area around the Black Sea where Mithridates held swayit 's known for its poisonous honey . Some of his allies put out combs of it near our routeour soldiers helped themselves , and we lost many . Many . " He shook his head . " But why did you eat it , if you knew it was poisonous ? " " We did n't know ; we only found out afterward . It seems the bees feed on azaleas there , and there is something in the nectar that poisons the honey . The plant itself is poisonous ; people in the area call it goat-bane , ' lamb-kill , ' and cattle-destroyer . ' That 's a clue we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bees ? Does it kill them , too ? " Olympos asked . " And Caesar tried to get a measure passed in the Senate , " Pompey was saying , " so that Egypt " " You , too , friend ! " Father was wagging his finger , as if it was all just too , too funny , and not threatening at all , and Pompey his great and good comrade , instead of a vulture trying to eat us . Pompey was smiling disarmingly . " True , true , but " " No , the bees are immune , " said Theophanes . " The good honey is all mixed up with the bad . " Varro had joined the discussion . There was now no way that the faraway conversation could prevail over three close voices ; I might as well give up trying to listen . " It seems that only part of the comb can be poisonous . " " But does n't it look or taste different ? " asked Olympos . He sounded so solemn , so professional . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Theophanes . " But not so markedly that it would always warn us . " " Honey made in early spring , " added Varro . " And when it strikesthen you know ! The soldiers were overtaken with tingling numbness , then started seeing whirling lights and tunnels , they swooned , then started vomiting and became deliriousthat 's what the ones who recovered described later . " He paused dramatically . " Their pulses slowed , and they turned blue . " " Oooh . " Olympos looked impressed at last . He seemed very difficult to impress , or even ruffle . " Did you know that Xenophon 's troops fell victim to it , too ? Four hundred years ago ! Thousands collapsed . In the same area . We historians busy ourselves with such data , " Varro was saying . " Now that I 'm here , I 'd like to consult some of the scrolls in the famous Library . Where supposedly all written knowledge resides ! " He shouted over at Father . " Is n't it so ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he bellowed . Father broke off his conversation with Pompeythe conversation I was longing to hear , although I did find the " mad honey " interesting . But not as interesting as the will giving Egypt to Rome . Had one of our ancestors actually done that ? Isis forbid ! " Eh ? " he said , cupping his hand over an ear . " I said , do n't you have half a million scrolls here in the Library ? " yelled Varro . My sisters rolled their eyes again at more Roman boorishness . " So they say , " said Father . " Yes , it 's true , " said Olympos 's father . " Every manuscript ever writtenor that a Ptolemy managed to lay hands on , rather . " " Yes , we kept the originals and sent the owners away with copies ! " said Father . " Ah , the glories of Alexandria , " said Pompey , considering them . He smiled . " Shall we arrange a tour ? " asked Father . " Tomorrow , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply , another blare of trumpets sounded , and the gold service was changed yet again , with much ceremonial clanging and clatter . At each round , the implements became more ornate . The eating proper could begin , and it did , with a profusion of dishes totally unfamiliar to mecertainly they were not the fare even royal children were served . Sea urchins in mint ... baked eel in chard ... Zeus-acorns ... mushrooms and sweet nettles ... Phrygian ewe's-milk cheese ... Rhodian raisins ... and fat , sweet dessert grapesalong with honey-cakes . Unfortunate choice ! Pompey and all the rest pushed them aside ; the sight and smell of honey were not pleasing to them now . " But this is from Cos ! " Father assured them , in vain . And there was wine , wine , wine , different for each foodEgyptian red and white , the famous apple-scented wine of Thasos , and , the sweetest of all , Pramnian . " It 's made from partially dried grapes , " explained Varro , smacking his lips as he downed it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " More lip-smacking . Since my wine was so diluted , I could barely tell the difference among all these , but I nodded anyway . Would that Father 's wine had been equally diluted ! For , in his nervousness , he drained cup after cup of it , and soon was wearing a strange half-smile and leaning overfamiliarly toward Pompey . And thenI shall never forget it ! he suddenly decided to call for his pipes and play . Yes ! To entertain the Romans , as he said . And because he was the King , there was no one to say , No , stop it ! You must not ! I longed to jump up and do it , but I was frozen in my place . I had to watch while his steward brought him the pipes , and while he lurched off the couch and made his way unsteadily to an open space where he could perform . I watched in horror , acute embarrassment , and shame . The Romans were staring , dumbfounded . Father took a deep breath to fill his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound was not loud , such a deep hush fell over the entire hall that every note quavered on the air . Olympos turned and gave me a pitying look , but it was kind , not condescending . I wanted to shut my eyes and not have to behold the painful sight of the King performing like a street musicianor a monkey for its master . It was the wine that had done this ! I vowed , in that instant , never to bow to wine or let it overcome mea vow I believe I have kept , although Dionysus and his grapes have caused me much grief nonetheless . Suddenly one of the Romans at another couch began guffawing , and that had a ripple effect ; soon even Pompey was laughing , and then the whole hall was roaring . Poor Father took it as approval and applause for himself , and even bowed . Thenoh , the shame of it ! he executed a little dance . What had he said ? You must be on your best behavior ; we have to convince him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the throne . How could he have forgotten his own mission , and Egypt 's danger ? Was wine that strong ? As my father wove his way back to his place , Pompey patted the cushion , as if the King were a pet . " The Romans feel dancing is degenerate , " Olympos leaned over and whispered in my ear . " They have bad names for people who dance . " Why was he telling me this ? To make me feel worse ? " I know , " I said coldly , although I did not . We have to convince him that Egypt is well served by our remaining on the throne . We Ptolemies ... Berenice and Older Cleopatra were just staring ; there was no help from those Ptolemies , either . Why did they not do something , say something , to offset it ? Tonight you must behave as a princess ... with dignity .... What an enchanting child .... Perhaps there was something I could do , something , anything .... Pompey had seemed to like me , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stool and walked over to him . He was leaning on one elbow , and as I came closer I could see that the wine had affected him , too . His eyes were a little unfocused , and he had a fixed smile on his face . A wide gold cuff gleamed on his forearm , and he was running his fingers over it . " Imperator , " I said , willing myself to feel the gold fillet on my forehead and remember that I was royal , " there is much more to Alexandria than a banqueting hall , or music . Tomorrow , in the daylight , let us show you its wonders : the Lighthouse , and Alexander 's Tomb , and the Museion and Library . Would you like that ? " One side of his mouth twitched up as he gave a crooked smile . " An enchanting child , " he repeated , as if that phrase were stuck in his brain . " Yes , yes , of course ... and you will guide us ? " " My father will show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet . " And I personally know the Lighthouse master " Meleagros joined in , to help . " Yes , Varro was most interested in both the i Library and the Museion . I will be honored to conduct you " Thus we all rushed in to save the Kingand Egypt .
