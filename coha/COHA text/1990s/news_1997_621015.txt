<p> SAN FRANCISCO CAN AFFORD TO SNUB STUDIOS <p> Editor  --  Thank you for the recent article ( Peter Stack 's " Hollywood Out on the Town , " June 9 ) about the courting of the movie business by San Francisco representatives . Most interesting to me were the remarks of the Walt Disney Co. executive , who seemed bent on convincing public officials and your readers that the city must offer " incentives " to attract moviemakers . <p> Besides being clumsy and transparent , his ploy did n't even jibe with a casual movie observer like me . For one thing , good luck duplicating the setting of San Francisco somewhere else . For another , the Bay Area is such an expensive place , I doubt some piddling incentives would be a decisive factor in a studio 's decision . <p> More importantly , why listen to only an arrogant and glib studio mind- set ? I would bet this city would be just as well-served by targeting small-budget and independent filmmakers  --  perhaps one of them could end up being the next Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of place that naturally attracts creative people , and someone whose career got a start here would be likely to have fond memories . <p> I mean , really  --  is San Francisco likely to have the next " Aladdin " made here ? <p> CHRIS O'CONNELL <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> FLUFFING UP ' PILLOW ' <p> Editor  --  Please do not send Ruthe Stein to review ( " Big Picture Missing From ' Pillow Book , ' " June 6 ) any more films like Peter Greenaway 's " The Pillow Book . " Not only is she ignorant of Greenaway 's previous works , she is clueless about the genre of films that use imagistic rather than conventional storytelling techniques . <p> " The Pillow Book " is one of Greenaway 's best , most realized films . It is visually stunning , intellectually challenging and emotionally stirring . How sad for Stein that she found it " confusing . " It 's sadder still that she did n't find it erotic ( despite the nudity , on which she harped ) . However , most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contrary to Stein 's provincial misgivings , I believe many cinema-goers in San Francisco can and will enjoy the film  --  if only guided to it by a more qualified critic . <p> L. GOLDMAN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> IN THE NAME OF BEER <p> Editor  --  I really enjoyed the U2 concert on Wednesday ( June 18 ) at the Oakland Coliseum . I purchased a beer for $ 5.25 , which I gladly paid as big stadiums and events always have expensive concession prices . U2 came on stage around 9:30 p.m . Three songs into its set I decided to purchase another beer . The concession line was small and I assumed it was because the show had begun . When I reached the counter I found out the beer had been cut off . <p> I do n't know what the Coliseum decision-makers were thinking , but to me a couple of beers during a 3 1/2-hour show is not excessive . I understand they cut off beer at the Raiders ' games to try and prevent fights among the fans , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main event starts really makes me wonder . Thank you , U2 , for providing an excellent quality show . I 'm still trying to find quality words for the Coliseum service . <p> THOMAS FREDREGILL <p> Vacaville <p> . <p> ' ' TIL THERE WAS ' BAD <p> Editor  --  I am 86 years old and have been viewing films regularly since age 8 at least once a week . Recently I went to go see " ' Til There Was You . " This is the first time I 've walked out on a movie . After 40 minutes I just could not bear watching and listening anymore . I 've disagreed several times with your weekly film write-ups but surely Ruthe Stein should have panned this awful film . <p> HARRY SKIDMORE <p> San Mateo <p> . <p> CIRQUE DU COMPLAINTS <p> Editor  --  Tip No. 1 for those going to see Cirque du Soleil 's " Quidam " at Jack London Square : If you are in anything but sections 0 , 1 or 2 , your seats are definitely off center for a program that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We specifically asked for good seats on any night , and the Cirque rep in Quebec assured us " these are just 18 rows from the stage , and the tent is so small there really are no bad seats . " Except for our seats in Section 5 , which were behind and to the rear of the stage . Not only that , but we were behind a support tower , one of four five- foot-wide structures used to support the tent . We could n't see a thing ! <p> Say what you want about BASS or Ticketron but at least they tell you where the seats are and whether or not they have an obstructed view . <p> Tip No. 2 : After we complained at intermission , an usher moved us to seats that were front row and center . This made all the difference as our original seats were so poor we were considering leaving at the break . Cirque probably expects few people to complain about their seats , but if you are in one of these sections I strongly suggest you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAKAMATSU NEGLECTED <p> Editor  --  Thanks to Stanley Lichtenstein for his letter ( June 17 ) on Jon Nakamatsu 's victory at the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition . The coverage that ran on June 9 should have been front-page news . I was terribly disappointed . <p> Being an old Nisei and having experienced discrimination and concentration camps in this country , I could n't help but wonder , was it because Nakamatsu is a Japanese American ? <p> Congratulations to Nakamatsu . He has brought recognition to the Bay Area and we are all very proud of him . <p> HELEN CHIZU IWANAGA <p> Danville <p> . <p> MEDIA MISSED STORY <p> Editor  --  I , too , take exception to the fact that there was a lack of television and radio coverage of Jon Nakamatsu 's winning of the Van Cliburn piano competition as Stanley Lichtenstein 's letter to Datebook pointed out . <p> Nakamatsu , a quiet , non-flashy American gentleman , brought back to the United States the first prize from the competition , all the while studying and practicing on a part-time basis . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-time ! <p> What does it take to impress the frenzied media ? <p> OLGA KALLOS <p> Santa Clara <p> . <p> PIANIST ON CBS <p> Editor  --  Regarding Stanley Lichtenstein 's letter , I would like him to know that that wonderful Sunday program on CBS called " Sunday Morning " did a 15-minute segment on June 15 on the Van Cliburn piano competition . It showed the finalists , among them that gifted Jon Nakamatsu . <p> PATRICIA GEISLER <p> Auburn <p> . <p> GEORGE BAILEY AND THE BEATLES <p> Editor  --  Doubting Thomas Angus MacDonald attributes all correlation betwixt " The Wizard of Oz " and the " Dark Side of the Moon " ( Letters , June 17 ) to coincidence and the uniformity of artistic expression . MacDonald has some valid points  --  I like his attitude and might even forgive him for watching " Friends . " But having witnessed the parallels first hand , I 'd like to enter a plea for believers . <p> After trying the experiment during a free period at my high school , I returned home hoping to emulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's claim that " it would work to any movie with any album . " So I popped in Frank Capra 's " It 's A Wonderful Life " and , after the third toll of the bell , played the Beatles ' " Sergeant Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . " There were a few peculiar similarities : " The act you 've known for all these years " turns out to be " the one and only " God ; Ringo sings " A Little Help From My Friends " as young George Bailey frolics with his buddies in the snow ; John Lennon sings of " a boat on the river " when young Harry falls in the frozen creek ; and " the girl with kaleidoscope eyes " is an unshaven Mr. Gower in a drunken stupor . Soon , though , the novelty wore off and anticipating a gymnasium full of students dancing the Charleston to " Within You and Without You " I turned it all off . It did not even approach the eeriness and appropriateness of the Oz/Floyd phenomenon . <p> Further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a band with as little talent and as much available studio time as Pink Floyd has would try some high jinks like this and keep it under wraps until they leaked it to the media 20 years later . <p> For those who still think any coupling would work , I recommend as control experiments " Casablanca " with U2 's " The Joshua Tree " or perhaps " Singin ' in the Rain " with Ani DiFranco 's " Dilate . " You 'll be disappointed . <p> Real fanatics can try " Bambi " with John Coltrane 's " A Love Supreme . " I , myself , plan to spend this evening pairing " The Lion King " with Hendrix 's " Axis : Bold As Love . " It 's the only thing that could get me to watch that movie . <p> M.
