The amount involved mere fractions , but Rudolph Giuliani proudly made his point last week . For the first time since 1978 , a mayor of New York City was proposing a budget smaller than the previous year 's . The actual difference  --  about $102 million sliced out of $31.6 billion , or just 0.3% less than the current budget  --  still caused critics to carp and unions to bawl . But Giuliani remained adamant . " Disagree with us about how we distribute the pie , " said the Republican , " but agree with us that it has to be a smaller pie . " It was Giuliani 's most substantial signal that New York City  --  the biggest spender of them all  --  was joining a movement trying to transform big- city gim me government . Wielding corporate-style tactics , the CEO mayors are taking on city hall . <P> In many large U.S. cities , a new breed of chief executive is performing fiscal triage . Urban reformers from both parties have fixed on programs grounded in austerity , responsibility , safer streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than politicians , they apply private-sector solutions to chronic urban woes and switch over to the technocratic jargon without pause . Such savants include Bret Schundler of Jersey City , New Jersey , Frank Jordan of San Francisco , and Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis , Indiana , the so-called Prince of Privatization , who refers to his citizens as " customers . " Goldsmith believes in " marketizing " his city  --  making every sector of it more competitive . He adds , " We have to ratchet down costs as much as possible . " <P> The mayors see little alternative . Since 1981 , two-thirds of federal support for the cities has dried up while the urban problems of crime , drug use and homelessness have burgeoned . Corporations and the middle-class families they employ have fled to the suburbs , taking their potential tax payments with them . With doors shut in Washington , mayors were forced to look at their own bottom line . <P> The pioneer among the new pragmatists is Philadelphia mayor Edward Rendell , 50 , a moderate Democrat . " No more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitals and from Washington , " says the former prosecutor . " No more looking for the cavalry to bail us out . " When he took the reins in 1992 , Philadelphia carried a $200 million deficit and municipal bonds with junk- level ratings . Its citizenry , meanwhile , was financially anemic from 19 tax increases in 11 years . Fifteen months later , Rendell had engineered the city 's first surplus since 1987 without a tax boost . <P> No budget item or entrenched interest group was spared Rendell 's whittling , including the municipal unions . After a failed strike , the members accepted a 30-month pay freeze , cuts in health benefits and a reduction in time off that saved the city an estimated $93 million a year . An additional $32 million has been pared by allowing 21 private companies to run everything from the maintenance of the Philadelphia Nursing Home to janitorial services at city hall .
