If Elizabeth Dole has a shot at the Republican nomination , it is because of women like Bonnie Curzio , a stay-at-home mom and independent voter . When she heard that Dole was coming to Des Moines , Iowa , last week to announce her exploratory committee , Curzio bundled her 10-year-old daughter into the car and headed for the convention center . Curzio , 40 , did n't know much about Dole , but she was drawn to the event in part because Dole is a woman  --  the first viable female presidential candidate in American history . " I guess that does make a difference to me , though I do n't consider myself a feminist , " Curzio said as she and 700 others waited in a jammed auditorium for Dole to arrive . " It would be historic if she won . " <P> Dole is betting on that sense of history to move an army of Bonnie Curzios  --  women who might not otherwise vote in a primary  --  to lift her to victory over Texas Governor George W. Bush . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to offer more than personality and symbolism if she hopes to turn inchoate interest into real support . Curzio and others like her want to know the candidate 's positions on the issues , but Dole did n't provide many answers in her canned , 25-min . Des Moines speech . If she had a theme beyond her resume , it was the nobility of public service  --  eloquent at times but loaded with platitudes . Her signature line  --  that Ronald Reagan 's famous question " Are you better off today than you were four years ago ? " should be rephrased to ask , " Are we better ? "  --  echoes Al Gore , who in 1996 began describing " an America not just better off , but better . " And in what has quickly become her custom , the candidate fled the event without taking questions from the audience or reporters . <P> Dole 's reluctance to define her politics has opened the door to critics eager to do it for her . Several leading religious conservatives have started attacking her  --  not for positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for the apparent ideological bent of the staff members she has hired . Chuck Cunningham , former national-operations director for the Christian Coalition , zapped an e-mail to scores of top conservative activists in early March lambasting Dole for choosing Linda DiVall , whom Cunningham describes as " the left 's favorite Republican pollster . " Citing DiVall 's past work for such " reliably liberal organizations " as Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign , a gay-rights group , Cunningham warned Dole that hiring DiVall " sends a deafening message to conservatives : Get to the back of the bus and shut up ! " Dole has said she opposes abortion except in cases of rape , incest and where the life of the mother is threatened , but die-hard conservatives worry about her staff 's influence . Cunningham 's Liddy-the-Closet-Liberal complaint was soon picked up by others , including Sheila Moloney , executive director of the conservative Eagle Forum . Moloney calls Dole 's selection of advisers  --  with its emphasis on Eastern Republican operatives like political strategist Kieran Mahoney and committee manager Tom Daffron  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
