<p> An important trend in social work practice is the renewed interest in identifying and using strengths as a basis for helping . More and more practice models are placing the identification of strengths in a prominent role in the helping process ( Briar , 1990 ; Hegar &; Hunzeker , 1988 ; Prevention , 1982 ; Nelson , 1990 ; Saleebey , 1992 ; Whittaker , Kinney , Tracy &; Booth , 1988 ) . Despite the renewed interest in strengths , too often a specific and practical means for identifying and using them is missing . <p> Most workers are well intentioned and many assessment forms include a token space for recording strengths , but such efforts are usually minimal when compared to the time and energy used to identify problems and deficits . Without a reliable means for finding strengths , it is likely that workers will revert to practice models which are based upon the identification of problems or deficits . " A strengths assessment is necessary to practice according to a strengths perspective " ( Weick , Rapp , Sullivan &; Kisthardt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method for conducting a strengths assessment . Limitations of Systems Theory <p> Social work relies heavily upon systems theories . ( Compton &; Galaway , 1984 ; Germain , 1979 ; Germain &; Gitterman , 1980 ; O'Neil , 1984 ; Pincus &; Minahan , 1973 ; Woods &; Hollis , 1990 ) . These theories are used to help explain the complexity of family systems and thus are important social work tools ( Hartman , 1979 ; Hartman , 1983 ) . Systems theories provide a framework for making sense of a family 's critical elements and interactions . But workers may feel obliged to attend to all of the various components and subsystems in the family though doing so is impossible . The complexity of families and the comprehensiveness of systems models also makes it difficult to practice a strengths perspective . <p> Research on problem solving suggests that when systems are very complex it is extremely difficult if not impossible to determine exact relationships between the elements of the system ( Simon , 1972 ; Rubenstein , 1975 ) . Causes of the current state of the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even knowable . Recent research in this area has indicated that for some situations , apparently insignificant occurrences can significantly alter the entire system ( Drucker , 1989 ) . <p> Applying a conventional systems framework to families experiencing child abuse , for example , will likely lead the worker to ask which specific aspect of the family is the problem ? One could construct a long list of difficulties in the family that might contribute to the abuse . But we often do not know with certainty which of the numerous concerns or needs is the cause of the abuse . Using systems theory in the conventional manner can result in workers becoming overwhelmed when trying to determine which problem they should start with in order to protect the child . The consequences of selecting the " wrong problem " are severe for the child and family . <p> Families striving to care for a child with severe emotional disabilities ( SED ) at home provides another example of the consequences of using a problem oriented systems model . These families are under great stress and experience considerable drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Thompson &; Doll , 1982 ; Weil &; Karls , 1985 ) ; therefore , at a given time it is possible to find numerous concerns and needs . But focusing only upon their problems can be overwhelming to all involved and a great disservice to the family . <p> In complex systems such as the family , a different model of problem solving has been suggested ( Rubenstein , 1975 ) . This alternative model focuses on the desired end state ( or goal ) , modifies elements of the system and monitors its status to see that the desired end state is approached or achieved . Since exact relationships between specific elements , actions and the state of the system are largely unknown , there is , instead , an emphasis placed upon the creative use of resources and monitoring progress . <p> The authors of this article have had the opportunity to work with many children with SED and their families . The knowledge we have gained shows that it is possible for many of these families to keep their child at home . Energy which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used to combine the family 's strengths with the additional resources it needs to reach its goals . The Strengths Assessment and Planning Process <p> To the authors ' knowledge , there are no empirically supported models of case management for youth with SED . However , outcome studies conducted in conjunction with the Family Advocacy Model ( which incorporates this strengths assessment process ) show positive results . For example , more than sixty percent of the objectives set by clients were achieved ( Ronnau , 1989a ; 1989b ) . The family strengths assessment developed by the authors involves three steps . <p> First the desired end state , or goal , is determined . The goal is defined from the perspective of the family and child and must be in keeping with the normalization principles of the strengths model ( Ronnau &; Page , 1991 ) . In the case of caring for a child with an emotional disability , the goals typically involve the child being educated in the most normal environment possible , the caregiver being able to manage the child 's behavior , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next step is finding resources to help the family reach its goal . Typically , the abilities , talents , and energies of the family become the primary resources . For example , a mother wanted to bring her son home from the psychiatric hospital . Among the many strengths found in this family was the mother 's ability to learn very quickly . The plan became for this parent to learn a behavior modification program so that she could manage her son at home . Because her son 's behavior changed quickly , it was necessary for the parent to frequently adapt the plan . Thus , the mother 's mental agility ( a family strength ) permitted her to effectively care for her child at home . <p> The third step involves the formulation of objectives which are designed to achieve the desired goals . Specific standards have been established for objectives to insure that they are consistent with the strengths model ( Ronnau &; Page , 1991 ) . If a particular objective is not achieved , it may be altered or deleted and another selected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome of the strengths approach . Strengths Assessment Model <p> The authors have selected the family systems model developed by Turnbull , Summers and Brotherson ( 1984 ) depicted in figure I as a framework for the strengths assessment process . We will briefly discuss the four major components of the framework ( Family Structure , Interaction , Life Cycle , Functions ) in order to permit the reader to see how strengths and resources are identified . <p> Family Structure refers to characteristics of the family ( e.g. , number of members and forms , cultural backgrounds , income , geographic locations ) ; characteristics of individual family members ( e.g. , health , intellectual capacity , coping styles , and special needs ) ; and cultural and ethnic diversity . <p> Culture and ethnicity are important elements of family structure which should receive special emphasis . Workers must develop the attitude and skills necessary for delivering culturally competent services ( Cross , Bazron , Dennis &; Isaacs , 1989 ) . Use of the strengths assessment does not guarantee that workers will avoid all crosscultural practice errors ; however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the helping process make such mistakes less likely ( Ronnau &; Shannon , 1990 ; Ronnau , Lloyd , Sallee &; Shannon , 1990 ) . <p> The critical task of the strength 's assessment regarding Family Structure is to explore family members ' perceptions of their cultural background and the meaning it has for them . The worker must pay attention to the significance family members themselves attach to values , customs , rituals , etc. in order to uncover their cultural strengths . It is stereotyping to assume that all families who share a similar culture have the same strengths . For example , the Bureau of Indian Affairs recognizes 493 Native American groups in the U.S. ( New Mexico Department of Human Services , 1989 ) . Therefore , it would be a gross crosscultural error on the part of the worker to assume that all Indian people share the same values . <p> With so many families being biological and cultural mixtures , it is easy for a worker to make inaccurate assumptions about cultural identity . Each family experiences its culture differently , depending on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , it is frequently said that the extended family is an important source of strength for many cultures , especially Hispanics . However , some individuals may no longer experience extended family as a strength for many reasons , including relocation for the purposes of obtaining employment ( Keefe , Padilla , Carlos , 1979 ) . <p> Family Interaction includes the subsystems within a family and the characteristics of cohesion and adaptability . Examination of the four major subsystems ( marital , parental , sibling , extra-familial ) for strengths helps assure that important resources are not overlooked ( Turnbull &; Turnbull , 1986 ) . In families struggling to care for a child with SED , the needs of other family members may be forgotten . Similarly , the potential abilities and contributions of other family members are often overlooked . For example , the willingness and abilities of siblings to provide caregiving can be a critical resource for helping a child with special needs remain in the family . <p> Workers using a deficit approach may look for and find difficulties in the way family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rigid . " Indeed , a family 's abilities to maintain healthy bonds ( cohesion ) and to change in response to stress ( adaptability ) may be severely challenged by the care of a member with a serious disability . But with the strengths approach , the worker 's first priority is to look for what the family is doing right ! If no strengths are apparent , we move on to another aspect of the family system . If a strength exists , we record it for future consideration as a resource for planning . <p> Family Life Cycle represents the developmental and non-developmental changes that occur within families . Changes in family membership ( structural change ) alter other aspects of the family , such as its resources ( e.g. , a child is born or a parental caregiver leaves ) . These changes affect the manner in which the work within the family gets done ( functional changes ) . For example , a divorce results in one parent assuming a disproportionate share of caregiving tasks . Similarly , such changes as a child reaching independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle build capabilities or strengths . It is easy for parents to forget that they successfully assisted one child to become a fully contributing member of society when another may be having difficulties . <p> The social-historical period in which one becomes an adult or parent can have an important effect upon development . For example , the parent who served in Viet Nam may have a very different set of experiences , values , and expectations than the parent who was involved in the Gulf War . Or consider the task of providing care to a child in a neighborhood containing a " crack house , " with its accompanying violence and dangers , while the youth 's parents growing up in the same neighborhood were " only " exposed to the problems associated with alcohol and marijuana . Changes in society place different demands upon families  --  simply managing to get a child to school safely on a regular basis in some neighborhoods is a tremendous accomplishment . <p> Family Functions represent needs the family must meet for each of its members . Family functions are a rich area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection to self-definition , the family seeks to produce what each member needs to survive . While a family may have significant problems or unmet needs ( e.g. , lack of money , school problems , delinquency ) , typically it is producing very well in several other areas ( e.g. , affection , cultural identity , domestic needs , self identity ) , and these are strengths . Uses of the Strengths Assessment <p> The strengths assessment is introduced early in the helping process and family members are encouraged to participate . As strengths are identified , they are used to : Find resources to meet the family 's needs ; Remind family members of their own strengths ; and Represent family members to other professionals . <p> The strengths assessment provides the resource base for meeting a family 's goals and objectives . <p> Maria was at her wits end trying to find supervision for her son , Tom , after school before she returned from work . The neighborhood babysitters were reluctant to provide care because of Tom 's diagnosis and history of psychiatric hospitalizations . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in trains and model train building . Maria remembered that there was a retired railroad worker-neighbor whose hobby is model train building . Once the case manager explained the family 's needs and what could be expected from Tom , the neighbor was pleased to help out . Tom learned a lot about trains and in turn helped his neighbor with yard work . <p> Too often the family is not aware of its own talents , abilities , and energies . The tendency for family members to disregard their own strength is not surprising or difficult to understand . Families who have been caught up in the formal service system become accustomed to being labeled " the problem . " The strengths assessment provides the family with renewed energy and confidence to continue their caregiving efforts . <p> Henry was very discouraged because his daughter had just been readmitted to the psychiatric hospital . The family had invested so much time , energy , and money getting Janet back in the community and into school . Given the intense emotions surrounding this traumatic experience it is no wonder that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So the case manager helped the parent regain his perspective . <p> He was reminded that his daughter had spent several successful weeks in the community prior to the rehospitalization , and that she had been regularly attending school , was participating in a soccer team and taking on more and more responsibilities at home , such as doing the dishes , picking up her clothes most of the time , and sharing in food preparation . These gains are important , and both the parent and the youth were reminded that they provide a foundation for another successful reentry int the community . <p> Just as a family 's self-image be comes distorted , so do the professionals ' views of the family ; thus , the strengths assessment is also used to provide a more accurate picture of the family to others . <p> Cindy was ready to give up . No matter what she said or did , all she heard was criticism from her son 's teachers and principal . School contacts were becoming extremely anxiety provoking for her , and she knew her attitude was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission , the case manager , Sue , met with school staff . While first listening to the litany complaints , Sue took every opportunity to point out the family 's strengths , such as the parent 's success at consistently providing food , clothing and shelter for her child via her steady job . <p> While it was true that Chris had again been suspended from school for fighting , the parent had quickly expressed an interest and consistently attended meetings when called . School personnel needed to be reminded that Cindy was doing a remarkably good job caring for her son despite the extra demands of his special needs , which were imposed on top of the normal demands of single-parenting an adolescent . The change was slow but school staff began to see the family in a more positive light . Conclusion <p> The importance of recognizing clients ' strengths is receiving more attention in the literature , but the absence of practical means for implementing the strengths approach remains problematic . This article has described a strengths assessment process which uses a systems framework . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means for recognizing strengths , which are then used as resources to meet the family 's needs .
