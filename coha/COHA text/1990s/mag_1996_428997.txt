THE DISCOVERY of Neptune was a triumph of 19th-century celestial mechanics . John C. Adams in England and Urbain J. J. Le Verrier in France independently deduced where an eighth planet should lie , based on a mysterious 2-arcminute deviation in the path of the seventh ( Uranus ) . When Johann G. Galle examined that area in September 1846 the planet was indeed there . It was n't exactly where either astronomer had predicted , but being off by only one or two degrees was remarkable . When our editorial staff first discussed having an article about the 150th anniversary of Neptune 's discovery ( see page 38 ) , the discourse shifted to how well today 's popular astronomical software would depict the event . Commercial software owes much to investigations like Adams 's and Le Verrier 's . The mathematics developed to characterize the motions of the planets is the core of every sky-simulation program . Ideally , every program should give the same result . The equations for determining where things are found appear in such works as Jean Meeus 's Astronomical Algorithms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take shortcuts in the calculation . Then , too , displaying planets as they would appear from a selected location on Earth ( and with pleasing graphics ) is quite another issue . So just how accurate are these programs ? How closely do they agree ? After all , as the story of Neptune makes clear , the planets are slightly affected by their mutual gravitational attractions . Over time gradual changes occur in their orbits And the perihelion point of Mercury 's orbit slowly shifts because of relativistic effects ( S &T; October 1995 , nace 86 ) . Other factors also enter into creating an accurate sky simulation : The precession of the Earth 's axis in a roughly 26,000-year cycle affects the celestial coordinates of objects . Precessing all positions to the " equinox of date " is the only way to orient stars and planets correctly in the sky , whereas a published star chart or comet ephemeris is usually based on equinox 1950.0 or 2000.0 . Furthermore , superimposed on the precessional changes is a cyclical wobble in the Earth axis called nutation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would appear from an airless world . For objects near the Earth ( the Moon , close-call asteroids and comets ) , the parallax at your observation site can significantly affect where your target appears against star fields . For such objects , all simulators should show the sky as seen from the Earth 's surface ( topocentric ) and not the center of the planet ( geocentric ) . The finite speed of light has two consequences . As the Earth revolves around the Sun , the apparent positions of stars are shifted ( aberration ) . And for objects in the solar system , the light-travel time must be factored in : we see them not where they are but where they were . Proper motion gradually changes the stars ' positions as they and the Sun orbit the galaxy . The Earth does n't spin at a constant rate . Overall , the Earth is slowing . The measure of this effect is called Delta T ( DeltaT ) , which is the difference between Dynamical Time ( based on gravitational theory and atomic clocks ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This value can not be predicted more than a few years into the future ; it can be found accurately only from celestial observations . Currently , DeltaT is about 61 seconds ( UT is behind ) . Photograph Today 's simulation software performs well in showing current skies , but it often falters when called upon to depict ancient celestial scenes , such as this conjunction on March 3,1953 B.C. Note especially how the Moon 's position varies among the products . From top to bottom , these screens are from Earth Centered Universe , Voyager II , and Redshift. // This time difference has the utmost importance for some astronomical calculations . If you ignore it , the Moon and planets will be " off " by the amount they move in the DeltaT interval . Even in the current era it can shift the path of a total solar eclipse by hundreds of kilometers . The problem becomes more acute for calculation of events in the distant past because estimates for DeltaT 4,000 years ago are between 11 and 13 hours . While the planets move only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6deg enough to displace an eclipse track halfway around the world ! The problems are similar for lunar occultations . A reliable value for DeltaT is needed to predict occultation events accurately . TEST CASES I selected 14 astronomy programs 10 for Windows or DOS and five for MacOS ( see the box on page 87 ) - to explore a few popular uses of home astronomy software . I looked at Neptune 's discovery , a recent occultation of Venus , an ancient grand conjunction , and the real-time position of an asteroid . While historical events hold a lot of appeal , they do n't make good test cases in general . The uncertainty in AT casts doubt . Without some credible eyewitness accounts of an event , we ca n't really be sure which simulated scenario is correct and how far off the others are . David S. P. Dearborn of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory shares this concern . As coeditor of Archaeoastronomy &; Ethnoastronomy News he has a keen interest in ancient sky events . He points out that checking one or even two events is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty that the events occurred . " In fact , " he warns , " it is entirely possible that the values used in some codes were tuned to hit a well-known historic event . " Thus , my examination here is by no means definitive . The ultimate comparative astronomical software evaluation remains to be devised . Testing Neptune . To obtain a " true " position for Neptune , I used the U.S. Naval Observatory 's Interactive Computer Ephemeris , a software package that , while no longer officially supported , may still be found in some online libraries It gives highly accurate solar-system positions from the year 1800 to 2049 . Entering 0:00 UT for September 24 , 1846 , yielded the first value in the first table on page 86 . This position was right on the money for where Galle spied Neptune , as indicated in a chart reproduced in a 1960 issue of Vistas in Astronomy ( Vol. 3 ) . // NEPTUNE AT DISCOVERY* // John C. Adams and Urbain J. J. Le Verrier each predicted where an eighth planet of the solar system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1846 , Johann G. Galle found it . As this view from Voyager II reveals , typical of all the software evaluated , on that evening Saturn was a little more than 1deg away . // VENUS OCCULTATION* // SKYTEL 'S POSITION* // When I set the date with the first commercial program , I was surprised to discover that Saturn was only 1 1/3deg away from Neptune ( a fact seldom mentioned in history books ) . On the whole , the programs determined Neptune 's position rather well . Only two ( First Light and DeepSpace ) were off by as much as 1/2 . Venus occultation . On page 77 of the January issue , David Dunham noted that on February 21st observers in Hawaii could view the spectacular sight of Venus being occulted by a crescent Moon . He predicted that as seen from Honolulu Venus would disappear at 7:53 p.m . Hawaii Standard Time , then reappear 62 minutes later . Again , as shown in the second table , most of the programs were correct to within a minute or two . The grand conjunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a test for early March 1953 B.C. At that time the Moon and all the classical planets were visible before dawn , a spectacle that may have marked the beginning of the Chinese calendar ( S &T; December 1993 , page 13 ) . Most of the programs accurately reproduced the clustering of planets on the morning of March 3rd in eastern China , as determined by scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory . Expert Astronomer and MacStronomy were significantly off with Mercury and Venus as evening-sky objects , and every program had the Moon in a slightly different place . Finding our asteroid . I chose the magazine 's own 3243 Skytel for a final test . The asteroid 's correct position  --  calculated for Cambridge , Massachusetts , at 0 hours UT , September 1996 - was obtained from the electronic ephemeris service of the Minor Planet Center . Manual entry of Skytel 's orbital elements into each program was the most aggravating part of this test . While some of the programs , such as TheSky and RedShift , already included Skytel in their database , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my evaluation . The process was a breeze with programs such as TheSky and SkyMap , which ask for values exactly as issued by the center . But others , such as Starry Night and Epoch 2000 , force you to perform additional calculations to format the data properly , primarily because they make no distinction between the elements for comets and those for minor planets . Redshift does not allow you to update its built-in elements , and some programs do not allow addign new objects . WHAT I LEARNED Other than finding out that the planet Satrun was situated very close to Neptune that September evening in 1846 , I did n't have any relations . In the end , when it comes to looking at tonight 's or next week 's sky , any of the programs does fine . Your personal choice will depend on what features you want ( such as printing detailed charts , adding new comets , or even controlling a telescope remotely ) , or how demanding your need for accuracy is . As for exploring historical or future events in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in approximately the right places , but the uncertainy in DeltaT will likely cast doubt on the true appearance of a sky far removed in time . , jeyyriS Photograph Starry Night shows Venus being occulted by the Moon on February 21,1996 , as seen from Honolulu , Hawaii . The time of disappearance was a three minutes late as compared to predictions by David Dunham. // <p>
