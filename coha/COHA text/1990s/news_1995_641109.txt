<p> Arts festival 's mission is n't to enrich local galleries <p> In response to Steve Rosen 's " review " of the Cherry Creek Arts Festival ( July 4 ) , I have a few questions : <p> Who decided that the mission of the festival was to increase " sales at contemporary art galleries ? " Why should it conduct an art expo " that includes regional contemporary-art dealers ? " <p> The " mission " of the festival has been publicly stated many times . It exists to expose people to fine art - not to just promote " contemporary art " ( in many cases depressing , inaccessible and angst-driven ) ; not to promote contemporary local galleries ( many of whom seem bent on self-destruction while blaming others in the process ) , and not to promote a limited , elitist view of what art is or is not . <p> Is the festival perfect ? Of course not . I would agree that some of the work is a little too cute . But I also accept this as part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and artists . By presenting a variety of art forms and expression , the festival is able to appeal to many people and bring thousands of them together to experience the broad range of what art is . It is not there to dictate what art must be or to ensure that local galleries will collect their assumed share of the booty . <p> As a visitor to contemporary art galleries , I have been greeted ( or not ) by a succession of disinterested , detached and bored attendants unable , in many cases , to answer even the simplest of questions about the artist or media . The exhibitions themselves have been poorly publicized , many times incorrectly characterized and often so esoteric as to be incomprehensible to those of us without a " fine art " clue . <p> Bad marketing and poor customer service are more to blame for local contemporary art gallery misery than the supposed " failure " of the Cherry Creek Arts Festival to provide them with " trickle-down " business . If the art galleries were smart they 'd take a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them feel welcome . But I suppose that would be considered " too pedestrian " and " common , " so they 'd rather whine instead . <p> If you want to criticize the art selected by the jurors , then fine , fire away . But do n't make the festival the heavy , because many of the local contemporary galleries do more to scare off or ignore patrons than to promote the works on their walls . <p> CRAIG HOWSON <p> Lakewood <p> Regarding your art critic Steve Rosen 's July 4 column expressing displeasure with the Cherry Creek Arts Festival and his presentation of the old argument of fine art vs. craft , and cute craft at that : I would like to offer a different viewpoint in terms of art in our nation , Congress and the National Endowment for the Arts . <p> Art is an individual 's expression , a human subjective expression - the more subjective , to the point of shared archetype , the purer the art . <p> The NEA would be wise to support all such expressions , including those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sheer quantity of shallow art deserves attention . The depth of subjectivity and control of one 's destiny is a dramatic struggle for humanness , and this quantity shallow art is a portrayal of the gigantic threat to this struggle . Consider that many Americans are : working in careers of numerous part-time jobs , making their homes under conditions , covenants and restrictions , schooling their children in a comedy of errors and eating food prescribed as microwave-healthy . With this consideration of the lack of control many Americans have over their lives , it is amazing that so much artistic expression exists , even if it is shallow . <p> The NEA should admit that artistic expression has value for explorers , entertainers and new era artists . If Congress lets the NEA expand its recognition of the need for artistic expression by many Americans , maybe all those children who enter school and have not already had paper and pencil for practice , who have started their lives without the idea of self-expression , will be recognized and shown that they can have control of their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Cherry Creek Arts Festival may not have pleased Steven Rosen 's elitist 's art tastes , but it clearly pleased well over a quarter of a million festival-goers and 200 hard-working artists - not the mention the 800-plus volunteers who enjoyed themselves and found an outlet for their civic pride . Additionally , the festival provides an enormous financial benefit to the community because of sales tax and because it is a proven tourist attraction , with many of its visitors coming from out of state . <p> The goal of this festival is not to appeal to a small group of artistic elite , who are interested only in art suitable for a " cultural institution . " <p> The goal , instead , is to bring creative and popular art and artists into contact with the public in a setting that is entertaining and fun ( and free ) for the whole family . Too bad Steve Rosen and The Denver Post could n't appreciate the festival for the positives it contributes to our city . <p> AUDREY BRODT <p> Denver <p> Some other views on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal again and again , " decried The Post in a recent editorial regarding Robert Harlan and the fact that he will undoubtedly exercise his constitutional right to appeal his conviction and sentence of death . <p> It is indeed unfortunate that a major opinion maker like The Denver Post has lost sight of the simple fact that Robert Harlan is not , in fact , an " animal " but is instead a fellow human being who has committed a heinous , atrocious crime . <p> It is only when we allow ourselves the deluded luxury of engaging in rhetoric such as referring to Harlan , Rodriguez , Davis and White , all of Colorado 's current death row population , as " animals " or " garbage " or " scum " that we can scream for their lives with clear consciences . <p> The brutalization of society continues when our government waves the heads of the executed to the howling mob as a warning to others not to kill . <p> It is only when we as a society begin to untangle the wholly distinct yet hopelessly confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will pull ourselves away from the peril of mass destruction . Any system of justice must include an overarching respect for the most basic of all human rights - the right not to be killed by your fellow humans . That goes for Harlan , that goes for Hitler and that goes for the Oklahoma City bomber . <p> Like it or not , as Justice Brandeis recognized close to 70 years ago , " Our government is the potent , the omnipresent teacher . For good or for ill , it teaches the whole people by example . " It is a sorry example when our government ca n't pull itself from the muck and mire of centuries of historical human brutality and inhumanity and stop killing its citizens . It is also a sorry example when the editorial page of a leading newspaper ca n't seem to rise above the level of the condemned human beings ( a.k.a. " animals " ) whose destruction it so loudly calls for . <p> DAVID A. LANE <p> Denver <p> Chuck Green 's smiling and colorful face adorns his column on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd like to watch them stick the syringe of deadly poison in his evil and wicked veins . " The violence of murder begets the violence of execution which begets the violence in Green 's wicked words . <p> Green has never spoken one word with Rodriguez , yet he proclaims : " He still has expressed no remorse for his horrid life of preying on people , or any concern that he has been sentenced to die . " Wrong . As a Catholic priest , I have often talked to him ; do n't tell me , as the prosecutor did at the trial , that I 've been conned . <p> Despite what attorneys have told Green , Frank will be poisoned to death long before another 10 years . If Green is next to me watching the state of Colorado murder him that night , I will forgive his words of 1995 and pray that he too will someday join Frank in heaven . <p> JIM SUNDERLAND <p> Denver <p> A good example <p> of community spirit <p> in Cherry Creek schools <p> Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local middle school . On the final day of camp I attended a performance given there by the participants . I noticed that some work was being done on the front grounds , and as I walked closer I realized that the two men with shovels , wheelbarrows and such were in fact Bruce Jensen and Fred Calhoun , the principal and vice principal respectively . They were planting flowers . <p> This is a beautiful illustration of what really goes on in the Cherry Creek School District , contrary to some of the more misguided but commonly held perceptions . <p> People caring . <p> People working together toward a common goal , that being our commitment to excellence in the education of our children . <p> I think if anything sets us apart from other districts , it 's not our tax base but the community , in the very real sense , that works together , pitches in and gets the job done , no matter what it takes . <p> DEBBRA COOPER <p> Englewood
