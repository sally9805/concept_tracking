Deborah set about making herself useful from the minute she woke up , and most mornings she was first in the household to rise . She pushed off the bedcovers , slipped into her robe , and washed in the bathroom , dressing cautiously and wincing if a zipper or button clanked against the closet door ; her bed was in the attic , above where Quentin slept , and his wife and baby . Deborah slipped down the back stairs to the kitchen . Her goal was to be like water , without stop or start , a useful presence that Quentin would n't notice except to be vaguely grateful and admiring . Certainly not to ask how long she had been there and how long she planned to remain . <p> In the morning before her first day off , she pressed the orange switch on the coffee maker and kept vigil while it wheezed and crackled and steamed , and the coffee formed , drip by viscous drip , in the glass pot . The manufacturer , she learned when she replaced the broken one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault that the carafe had broken , only her bad luck . She 'd noticed the crack but had n't liked to call attention to it . Once the machine was finished , she transferred the coffee into two thermoses , one a thin stainless-steel rocket with a black strap , the other a homely blue plastic with stripes . Most of the household 's items fell into two categories : imported for him ; domestic for everyone else . Coffee steam rose from the carafe as she poured and from the thermoses as she rushed to screw on the tops , to capture the genii of the coffee before the morning air diluted it . Milk for her own coffee , she heated in a heavy saucepan , and into this , she dumped the last of the coffee . She washed pot and carafe quickly , before the milk skin dried on the pot , before the coffee stained the glass and the smell of detergent cut through the acrid meaty coffee odor . Then and only then did she settle at the table to drink her milky coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother insisted she drink on childhood nights when Deborah would not fall asleep . <p> It was the time she liked best in the Quentin household , and it did n't last very long . Either her noises or the smell of coffee brought the rest of them to the kitchen . <p> Her mother had had an awful time of it , married young to a madman who lived now by the sea and was said not to recognize a soul from his past . This was Deborah 's father , and she had never met him . <p> The only father she 'd ever had was Tony , her stepfather , who had the best manners of anyone she 'd ever met . Even in situations that made her mother blow up , Tony never forgot to say " Please " and " Thank you . " He always thought of his guests ' comfort . He remembered birthdays and even anniversaries . He was fond of Deborah , her mother had assured her , and now that she was adult , Deborah could judge that for herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that included warm smiles when she was all the way at the end of the dinner table and their house was crowded with guests . <p> Tony had gone to the same prep school and college as Deborah 's father and claimed not to have known him sufficiently to answer questions . Her mother always answered the same : " It was a crazy time , Deborah . He just never came out of it . " Her mother had come out of it and so had Tony , but even her father 's name , Standish , spoke of being stuck in another time . Her mother had divorced Standish before his final madness and , in exchange for the house , her freedom , and custody of Deborah , had signed away all of Deborah 's rights to his fortune , a decision she still debated , sometimes admiring herself , and at other times cursing her stupidity . Then she 'd say , " Never look back ! Pillars of salt ! " She had whispered once to Deborah that she 'd bargained with fate , that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not touch Deborah ; though she denied saying this when Deborah questioned her . Dreaming , she must have been dreaming , her mother said . There were books in the library at home with Standish 's name scrawled inside , a careless , skinny signature . Deborah imagined him walking along a sea wall in his town , followed by an attendant  --  his books , house , wife , and daughter forgotten in the dream where he now lived . Once , in a beach house that Tony and Deborah 's mother rented for August , Deborah had opened the door of an upstairs bedroom whose bright blue floor was covered with dead bees , the shells of bees , really . They lay in groups , so many that at first she thought there was a yellow and black rug whose background matched the blue-painted floor . She 'd had the sense to tell no one about it . Her father 's mind was one of the bees , perfectly formed and hollow , supposed to be dead but perhaps only sleeping . They had tried everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antipsychotics , talking . A hot breath could blow him away . She had never met him . <p> That generation had all been divorced  --  even her stepfather twice  --  and at eighteen Deborah had given up on marriage for herself . Now that she was twenty-seven , she had also given up the idea of becoming a great artist . She 'd gone to art school and moved into a studio , but decided that though she liked to work with her hands and had thirsty eyes , she would never be any better than a good student . <p> She gave up the lease on her studio and moved back into her room at her mother 's , for how long she could n't say . Deborah needed something that would never leave her , she needed serious work , and for this she had come to the Quentin household , to be an apprentice to Quentin himself , whom everyone called by that name alone , even his young wife , who was only six years older than Deborah . He was the best in his field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered his latest work one afternoon in a shop on Madison that was more like a gallery , her mother said that Deborah had been looking at Quentin 's work all her life but had n't noticed it . A screen in her mother 's bedroom , always half-covered by clothing and robes , was an early example . Quentin was an old friend , her mother said , he 'd even lived with them for a time when lots of people were in Standish 's big house on the Cape that Deborah had never seen , all living together and , as her mother let her know now that Deborah was grown up , all together for a time and then parting . That 's how it was then . Perhaps Quentin might be willing to take Deborah on . Then her mother reported back to Deborah that she had made an arrangement with Quentin , and that Deborah would move there the next week . Deborah had been at Quentin 's for a month . She had been entrusted with only a few simple tasks in the studio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Waffles ! What a breakfast ! " Ellen said . She sat in the chair Quentin usually took , the baby in her lap , so that Deborah had two pairs of wide eyes on her . It was the babysitter 's day off , Ellen 's weekly chance to concentrate her full attention on the baby , and she was glad for it , she told Deborah . The baby 's eyes were wise and knowing , which meant good digestion , Ellen said . Ellen 's eyes were wise and knowing but also satirical , as though Ellen knew a few things she was n't saying . Every word she did say sounded chosen to Deborah , not rehearsed but pronounced with care and forethought . " You wo n't be here tomorrow , and I 'll have to make the coffee and something for breakfast . Cheerios . Nothing special . We 'll miss you . " <p> " It 's only a day trip . I 'll make the coffee before I go . " <p> " That would be so sweet of you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married Ellen . He 'd been five years or more between wives , and the place was stark , its plaster walls and rough trim the same gray-white , the pine floors beat up and dull . His furniture was simple wood , the one sagging couch the only piece of softness . Now the floors were waxed , the fieldstone fireplace sported a shining copper bucket for kindling , and tiger-striped curtains hung at the windows . The walls were stained a pale yellow , and there was a fat couch with sausage arms dressed in a floral linen that looked as if it had faded over years of use . Black , yellow , copper : all variations and distortions of color blended perfectly . Deborah had come upon a magazine story on Ellen 's redecoration shortly after she 'd discovered Quentin 's work , and took the coincidence as a sign that Quentin would help her find her metier . The equation was completed when her mother arranged so easily for her visit . She had wondered , looking at the pictures , where Ellen had learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses to go to . Deborah , if it had been she , would have left Quentin 's house just as it was . Maybe she would have added an armchair . In her mother 's living room , there was an invariable group : couch , two armchairs , and a big ottoman that doubled as a table , tweed in the winter , chintz in the summer . <p> " Will you be going far ? " Ellen asked . " Where does this old school friend live exactly ? " <p> " Near Gloucester . " But " near Gloucester " was too near the truth . She should have said Stockbridge , at the opposite end of the state . She might have gone to Gloucester anytime in the years since art school , or even when she was at boarding school . But she 'd felt timid with the past and had been waiting for her father to call for her at school , the way other parents did sometimes , surprising their boarded children . Her mother 's visits were planned long in advance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's time would be wasted waiting for Deborah to finish class or change from her gym clothes . In her last year of art school , she 'd studied a map of Massachusetts and located Gloucester , which became her true north , the place she would go when she was ready . <p> " I 've never gone to Gloucester . Have I , baby ? " <p> " I probably wo n't go there , to Gloucester itself , " Deborah said . " She 's out in the country , near Gloucester She 'd never been good at lying but was doing all right so far . <p> " Roommates ! It 's wonderful you 've kept up . I have n't had the time . " <p> Deborah had known girls like Ellen at school , pretty and accomplished , girls for whom things went smoothly . Except Ellen had married a man old enough to be her father and had a baby who looked like the man 's grandchild , so that strangers looked around for the missing young husband . Just what Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said that Quentin never kept wives for long . Ellen looked as though she 'd stay as long as she liked . Certainly Deborah was no threat to her , newly unpresentable in baggy work clothes and her bad haircut . Deborah had always been her mother 's creature , dressed in her mother 's severe , expensive style , her hair cut by her mother 's reliable haircutter , who knew how to soften Deborah 's features and make her look more feminine , more like her mother . On the way up to Quentin 's , Deborah stopped at a mall and got a haircut as a sign of her new life , a different look to go with the work clothes she 'd bought used downtown . She was on her way to an apprenticeship , she told the girl at the fast-cut shop , and did n't want her hair to get in the way . A month later it was barely an inch long all over her head , making her look less like a gamine than a newly released convict . <p> " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " <p> Deborah glanced at the clock . She was usually in the studio by now , safe from Ellen 's questions . Ellen liked to chat while Deborah made the studio lunch or breakfast , planting herself where she and the baby could watch Deborah 's every move . Deborah liked Ellen more than she had expected to when they first met . Ellen knew how to make herself cozy with Deborah , and Deborah found that throughout the day she tried to remember interesting thoughts or observations to share with her . <p> " She 's a broker for Merrill Lynch , " Deborah said firmly . <p> " Out in the country near Gloucester ? " <p> " Computers , " Deborah said . " There 's lots of widows who only trust a woman with their money . " <p> " Funny . As a rule , women like to trust men with their money , not younger women . Of course , she 's not so young . Your age . " <p> " Younger than you , " Deborah said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a child , most when you 're an adolescent . Then it fades . Or it all rolls together . " <p> " Maybe that 's why she 's so successful at what she does , " Deborah said . " The old ladies do n't mind . " <p> " Interesting , " Ellen said . " When I 'm a widow , I might have a younger woman take care of my money . Something I never considered before . If there is any money . " <p> " Of course there 'll be money . Why should n't there be ? " <p> Ellen laughed . " The golden goose will be dead . Gander . " <p> Deborah widened her eyes in imitation of the baby . " He 's not all that old . My mother 's age . Younger than my stepfather . He does n't seem at all old to me . " <p> Ellen loved to speculate about her widowhood and did so often with Deborah as an audience . Deborah would take part only in wondering about Ellen 's emotional future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby would do without him . When Quentin held the baby , as he did each night religiously , he turned the child toward him and gave the baby his most serious concentration . Would the baby remember ? Probably not . Ellen liked to calculate how young she might be at the break of widowhood , if she 'd be young enough to marry again or if she 'd even want to ( exhausted by Quentin ) . She knew a great deal about Quentin 's ex-wives . Like everyone else from the crazy time , Quentin had married a lot , and some wives did better than others , depending on the market value of his work at the time of the divorce . In gloomy moods , Ellen feared the return of the ex-wives to make ex post facto claims , however outlandish , on Quentin 's estate . One thing Ellen did n't have to fear was her status as the mother of Quentin 's only heir . Though he 'd married carelessly , she said , he must have been cautious about something , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " legal or otherwise , " she always said . They lived as high on the hog as they did because Quentin believed that living in the moment was the only practical thing to do , but Ellen had ticked off several times for Deborah the annuities and mutual funds she had set up in the baby 's name whenever Quentin let loose some cash . <p> Deborah watched him from the foyer outside the studio door , through what he called the observation glass . She thought it odd that a man who prized his privacy would keep unveiled the clear glass panel in the studio door , and she 'd offered to cover it with tracing paper . Of course , there were n't very many people on the place to peep through the glass . <p> Quentin was not very tall , taller than Picasso , and dressed like a super in khaki pants and a matching shirt , or blue pants and a blue shirt , his work uniform . Deborah never saw him in anything else . He usually came directly from the studio to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby into their end of the house . So what he wore for relaxing , Deborah did n't know . <p> Quentin was famous for his lacquer work , and he had a niche creating furniture , objects , and screens . He was so famous that he had become invisible , and when Deborah had discovered his work , she was surprised not so much that he was still alive as that he existed at all ; his name was synonymous with his work , and his work had taken his name away from him , as the Eames chair had from its designer . His latest work went beyond his old , beyond the decorative , and was garnering him new attention . He was applying brilliant technique to pure art with freedom and magisterial imagination . Some said it was a mistake , but Quentin said that it was so hard to know about your own mistakes , how could those fools be sure of his ? At first he did not allow Deborah to spend many hours in the studio with him . She worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials in small quantities . Because of the glass door into the studio , she called her foyer the glass booth , as if she were Eichmann on trial . While she waited for Quentin to call her , she read Trollope , her stepfather 's favorite novelist . <p> Quentin 's studio had been a surprise to Deborah . It was more like a storeroom than a workspace , big enough to accommodate the mess and the work , the boxes piled on boxes ( each box stuffed and labeled  --  materials , clippings , old photographs , bills ) , the platform on which a model might once have stood , now piled with file storage boxes . Quentin 's studio was the densest place she 'd ever been . Her mother 's rooms were paper-thin , decorated , and orderly . Deborah had offered to go through Quentin 's boxes for him and to file everything . Perhaps among the old photos were some of her mother and father , when they and Quentin had been on the Cape . He 'd laughed at the idea of organizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd said . Who the hell would care to go through that junk ? I never look at it , why should anyone else ? His biographer would care , if no one else , and Quentin must have realized that . He was at an age when biographies of his contemporaries , dead and alive , were emerging . Why keep the boxes at all ? Deborah wondered . He was not so careless of posterity 's opinion as he claimed , because , after a week , he let Deborah alphabetize and file business letters and reviews . He gave her a corner of the studio for her own , clearing away a stack of art magazines . She valued the hours when they worked in silence and listened to the classical radio station Quentin liked . His work was , of course , beautiful , but so was his concentration , and she found herself imitating his slight hunch as he stood before a piece . He watched her , too . Sometimes Deborah looked up and found him staring at her . <p> Her mother had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered yes without hesitation . Ellen joked about the flesh on his chin and neck that was ceding to gravity ; about his farts one terrible Sunday when he stayed in bed with a cold and took Vitamin C in quantity . Deborah 's mother told her that Ellen was probably threatened and playing down his magnetism . " You 're younger than she , " her mother said . " Quentin 's wives are always jealous , usually with cause . " At night and sometimes in the early morning , Deborah heard Ellen moaning for a long time and then one gasp from Quentin . She heard the baby cry and laugh , and Quentin and Ellen talking in low tones and sometimes arguing . She could n't make out the words . She wished she had a room far away from theirs , but the babysitter was established in the guest cottage . She could n't help hearing the sounds and listened for them . <p> When she reached Gloucester , she would walk along the sea wall and meet her father . <p> The story she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to Gloucester to visit a cousin , and there , walking by the sea , she 'd come upon Standish and his attendant . ( I am an attendant lord , thought Deborah , nobody important . ) At one time Grace and Standish were an item , then , when Deborah 's mother and Standish fell madly in love and were married , she became their dear friend , she and her husband , now dead in <p> single-car accident that Deborah 's mother referred to , though not in front of Grace , as a suicide . <p> By the sea , Grace had approached Standish . She said that he was wooden-faced , erect as ever , with his head held at an odd , fixed angle , a difference only someone who knew him well would notice . He and the attendant were walking very slowly , and they did not stop at Grace 's approach . Grace finally put herself in their path . ( Later , a shopkeeper told Grace they walked that same way every day . ) Standish , Grace said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He did n't recognize her . He looked at her through eyes she did not recognize . A stranger lived within , Deborah 's mother said Grace had said . Grace had retreated . Deborah imagined Grace stepping backward like a Graham dancer , in flowing black dress , the lift of her leg creating a pie slice of fabric . Standish and the attendant moved on as if there had been no interruption to their routine . He 's mad , Deborah 's mother sighed into the telephone , he 's gone . <p> When Deborah got to Gloucester , she would find the shopkeeper and the road by the sea where her father walked daily with his attendant . To ground herself in reality , she recited : He is old and has been ill , and he has not seen me since I was an infant . Nevertheless : They walked in their usual direction , eastward , perhaps , the sun to their backs , and moved slowly , in a stately fashion or perhaps a shuffle , but they moved . And she , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deliberately , carefully , not stirring the air to alarm them . They paused , or rather her father did , and the attendant , surprised , stumbled . Her father , stony-faced and stony-eyed , recognized Deborah , through all the years and the long absence of physical image , and he said : Deborah ? Or , Daughter ? Or , It 's you . I 've waited so long . He saw her and was surprised back into the world . And then ? To his house for hot chocolate ? She could not imagine any further and would rather have died than have anyone know what she imagined , which contradicted everything she had heard of him in particular and of fathers in general except in fairy tales . Still , she believed or wanted to believe enough so that she always came to the same place after wrangling with herself to be sensible : What do you have to lose , you who have nothing ? And everything to gain . Your father . <p> How do you do this ? How do you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't they teach you anything in your fancy art school ? " He was bald on top of his head and kept his white hair cut short and neat , accentuating the strong bones of his skull and his black eyes . He looked like the china bust her mother kept in the library , a man perfectly formed . When he bent over his drawing table , Deborah could almost see the dotted lines and small print labeling the regions of his brain . At first he explained his process patiently , but he must have caught on that she could n't listen . She could understand but not listen . Her eyes overpowered her ears and her unlabeled brain , and she let them roam over his broad muscled shoulders and his workman 's fingers . In early photographs of him  --  her mother had one tucked in a volume of Pound 's poems that she had never read  --  he had a mustache that concealed the thin meanness of his lips . Deborah 's questions stopped him from working , and he commanded her to be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent , or at least nonverbal . He kept music on all the time in the studio and , unlike her stepfather , did n't care what it was : Berlioz or Bach or " Carnival of the Animals . " But she needed talk . Quentin had a secret that Deborah needed , knowledge of her mother and father when they were young and in love . He would n't answer direct questions . He gave her unhappy looks and shrugs and turned away when she compromised her dignity and asked what her father was like . <p> Quentin looked up for the first time that morning and said to her , " I have a job of work for you , if you 're willing to work . " <p> " I always am . " If he needed her , she would stay tomorrow , too , go to Gloucester another day or week . <p> He said , " I 'm tired of this mess . Sweep the floor , if you can find it . " <p> " Is there anything you want to save that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , " he roared . " Are you deaf ? I just asked you to sweep it . " <p> She was trying to be thorough . She was trying to let him know that whatever he wanted from her , she was willing to do it . She saw herself with his sparkling black eyes , a lumpy , overgrown girl with very little hair , good only for sweeping . She turned and got the broom . When she finished an hour later , having swept slowly and carefully , he glanced up from his drawing table and looked at her over his bifocals . " Good work , " he said . " I wo n't need you anymore . Maybe Ellen needs a hand . That girl 's off today , is n't she ? " <p> " Yes . I 'll be off tomorrow . " <p> " Will you ? " <p> She thought he looked relieved . Two months , he 'd promised her mother , a two-month apprenticeship . <p> When there was company , Ellen cooked French food  --  a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , rice or noodles , <p> vegetable . Quentin loved sweetbreads , brains , and liver , and the local butcher saved them for Ellen , along with what he called veal , grass-eating calf . " It will do in the country , " Quentin said . He 'd lived in the country for twenty years , and his trips to the city were few and far between . Ellen complained that she never got to wear her city clothes . One afternoon while Deborah was supposed to be looking after the baby , Ellen showed her all the jackets and trousers , skirts and silk blouses , creamy cashmere sweaters she 'd bought in the last year , covering the bed with them . In the clothes , Ellen looked like another person , oddly like Deborah 's mother in her daytime outfits . <p> Tonight , for the second time in a month , there was fried chicken for dinner . Deborah had walked the baby in the stroller up and down the long winding driveway while Ellen dipped , dredged , and fried . Deborah would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now when it was disagreeably warm . Conversation was sparse when they ate together like this , more so without the babysitter , who kept up a running inquisition of the baby  --  was he hot or cold , did the food disagree with him , was he a sweet baby ? <p> " I heard , " Deborah said , " I was told once , that Standish was genuinely talented . As an artist . And that 's what made his madness an even greater shame . The loss  --  " <p> Quentin laughed . " Who in the world told you that ? Your mother ? I thought even she knew better than that . Standish was no genius . Nothing of the sort . First he was a dabbler , and then he was a promoter . " <p> " Quentin , " Ellen said . <p> " A collector but not in any big way . Not enough to really help anyone . He was a succubus . He had just enough of an eye to pick out your best work and then snatch it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Deborah stopped chewing the drumstick and stared . No one had ever talked about her father that way , using any but the one note of pity . She had been right to come here . If she learned nothing else , she learned that when her father , her own father , was young and not mad , he had the capacity to annoy someone like Quentin . A vein stood out on Quentin 's forehead . <p> " Your work ? " Deborah asked . " Your wonderful early work ? " <p> " Hah ! You look just like your wicked mother when you say that . " <p> " For God 's sake , Quentin , what is the point of telling Deborah any of this ? And keep your voice down . " Ellen looked at the baby , who was sculpting mashed potatoes . " Baby does n't like cross noises . " <p> " Honesty . That 's the point . " <p> Ellen rolled her eyes and said , " Someone always gets hurt when you start talking about honesty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin layer of grease around Quentin 's lips , like a down 's red mouth . <p> " Did n't they teach you anything in your fancy art school ? " His schedule was like her mother 's  --  drinks starting at six and on through the night  --  so Deborah was used to emotion at meals . " There have always been people like Standish . Auxiliaries , handmaidens of the arts , patrons , agents , people who oil the market machinery . But are not artists themselves . You 've heard of Vasari ? " <p> " I know who Vasari is , " Deborah said . <p> " Your mother . Another handmaiden . Another apprentice ! She and Standish fed the artists , let them have a room , a room and <p> studio . And food and drink . They were generous with food and drink , all right . AU for their good hearts . Not so generous . Not so selfless . No one is selfless except the boring dead . All the art ! We used to joke about the second-rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for room and board . All gifts ! Never asked for . Of course not . All gratitude . Some of it first-rate , inevitably . I 've wondered over the years . What happened to the art ? " <p> " Some of it 's there , " Deborah said . " She has a lot of art . Some she sold before she married Tony , but I have no way of knowing what . I mean , there are drawings and paintings in the house , and those are all I 've ever known . One of everything , my mother says . " <p> " My screen . " <p> " It 's been there all this time . In her bedroom . The first time <p> knew it was your work was  --  " <p> " When she called , called about you , she said it was in perfect shape . That 's how we made the arrangement , of course . Room and board for the screen . Very fitting , I thought . " He wiped his mouth . " She never cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised she never told you . I wanted to meet you , of course . " <p> " Quentin , " Ellen said . <p> " When did you actually know them ? " Deborah asked , to move the conversation along . " What years ? " She did n't want to cause <p> fight between Ellen and Quentin and then hear about it all the next week . <p> " You must know , " he said . " Did n't your mother tell you anything ? " <p> " If Deborah knew , she would n't ask , " Ellen said . " Would you like some fried chicken for the road , Deborah ? Unless you 're worried about making the steering wheel greasy . I 'll pack a napkin . Deborah 's going to Gloucester tomorrow , Quentin . To see an old friend . " <p> " Near Gloucester . Outside Gloucester . " <p> " Will you go to see Standish ? " Quentin asked . <p> " Oh , no , " she said . " I 've never met him . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood and began clearing the dishes , and Deborah helped her . When she reached for Quentin 's plate , he clamped her arm , and she was surprised by the strength and warmth of his grip . <p> " Deborah , " he said in the voice he got at the third drink . <p> " Why did you say that my mother was wicked ? " she asked . Playful , Tony said , your mother is being playful . <p> " You do n't look much like her . A beautiful woman . Is she still beautiful ? " <p> " Yes . Do I look like my father ? " <p> He was stroking the inside of her arm . <p> " The eyes are , " he said . " The mouth . The shape of your head . Your hands . " <p> " But  --  " <p> " Dessert ? " Ellen asked . <p> Deborah broke away from Quentin and took the plate into the kitchen . <p> She leaned toward the dappled mirror that hung crooked over the attic sink . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she liked best of Standish were nothing alike , her dash of a mouth and his Cupid pout . But maybe the photograph lied . She undressed in a hurry and put on her old flannel gown that Ellen laughed at , calling Deborah a marvel for keeping a nightgown so long . <p> Quentin and Ellen quarreled that night , and Deborah did her best not to hear . The attic had two dormer windows , and she could n't stand in most of the room . The baby 's room was just below the attic door ; Quentin 's bed below Deborah 's . She pushed aside the worn rug that Ellen said fit nowhere else in the house so perfectly as the attic , and she took to the floor with a glass , which worked only medium well on the bumpy floor . " Original , " Ellen had said , unsanded and rough . Baby 's something . Baby 's nights ? Baby 's right ? Baby , baby , baby  --  the only word Deborah could make out in a blur of words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lots of talking , Tony kind of talking , background noise , when she could n't make out the words in the dream or when she woke , yet she heard it throughout the day , a buzz in her ear . <p> The music of their quarrel came to an end . Deborah waited until it was as quiet as the morning , then searched in the dark for her socks and robe , and descended the bare wooden stairs , her hand on the wall for support . In the darkened living room , the tiger curtains  --  the perfect balance of yellow and black  --  hummed like bees on a summer afternoon , and she glided past the sound without making a sound herself . The baby 's room was on the other side of the door , and she paused at the crib . Baby had a night light shaped like a fat bumblebee , its black stripes shadows , its yellow hills glowing . Baby slept on his stomach , his mouth a little open , his wide eyes closed . She ran her palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In and out , and Deborah counted his little warm breaths until he stirred and moved from her hand . <p> The door to Quentin 's bedroom was open . She navigated carefully the smooth polished floor and fat rugs until she stood at the bottom of their bed . Their feet were intertwined like a vine and a tree , and at first she could not tell whose leg was where . Ellen 's foot was smaller and at the very bottom of the bed , caught in the fold of the sheets and the blankets , her toes discernible , tangible , the arch swelling the blanket . Bending , Deborah felt the outline of her toenails , like seashells in sand . <p> Ellen 's eyes were on her . " Deborah . What 's wrong ? " No answer possible , and then , " You 're frightening me , " and movement beneath the covers . <p> She took her hand from Ellen 's foot , and Ellen hid beneath the covers .
