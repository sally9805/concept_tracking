<p> BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK , most of the glasses had been removed from the upper tiers of the champagne fountain and many from the lower , a trail of spills leading away from the garland-draped table . Jeremy Barseleau sat in a folding chair , watching the women in their heels and sequined dresses lift away the amber glasses , silently urging them to take the lower ones , waiting for the removal of the glass that would cause the whole thing to collapse . Earlier he had contributed to this effort himself , downing his sixth drink as the deputy mayor handed Jeremy 's wife , Jean , an award from the museum for Volunteer of the Year . Applause echoed off the walls hung with enlarged photographs of microscopic animal life : tiny dust mites , deer ticks , the mouth parts of fleas . <p> An elderly , overly rouged woman sat next to Jeremy , talking on and on about the battle of Fort Fisher and what heathens the Yankees were to attack on Christmas Day . He half-listened , watching the pool of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front of the room , a man in a tuxedo and a light-up bow tie played requests on his portable electronic keyboard . A large plastic banner hung in the corner exhibited his name , DON WEST , spelled out in fluid , dayglo letters . He passed around a cordless mike and asked everyone to help him out with " Jingle Bells , " the crowd singing in noisy , off-key unison . <p> The elderly woman touched Jeremy 's wrist . " And your plans for the holidays ? " she asked . Her mouth puckered downward at the corners . Jeremy glanced at her nametag , smeared by some food or drink she 'd spilled . It looked as though her name was Kate  --  or had been , at least , earlier in the evening . <p> " Well , Kate , " he said , " the usual I suppose . I do n't plan to attack anyone . " <p> " Oh , heavens , let 's hope not , " she said , raising her hand to her thin chest . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his wedding band . He looked at his own fingers , twirling a fancy toothpick with the little colored plastic ribbon atop it . Somewhere , he thought , someone is making money selling plastic-topped toothpicks . The microphone passed him by . <p> " My wife wants to visit family in Florida , " he said . " That 's her , right over there . " He pointed to where Jean stood laughing and holding her lucite statuette , the deputy mayor 's hand perched inside the V of her backless dress . She looked gorgeous , as she had for as long as he could remember . Sometimes he saw her from a distance , for a moment not realizing it was she , and would catch himself checking out her breasts or the angle of her hips . <p> " Your wife is Jean ? " Kate said . " Volunteer of the Year ? Heavens , you must be proud as anything . " She smiled , her dentures even and white . <p> " I am , Kate . " He smiled back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself that this was what he felt now , pride , which somehow had learned to mock all the symptoms of boredom and fatigue . He loosened his tie and worked to undo the top shirt button , which popped off and landed in his plate , a tiny satellite for the meatball . He listened as Don West segued from " Jingle Bell Rock " into " I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus . " These occasions seemed so easy for Jean , effortless . He supposed what he really felt was jealousy . The idea was silly  --  jealous of his wife for escorting preschoolers through the hydraulic dinosaur exhibit . Jealous of her donated time . Jeremy shook his head , poked at the meatball , pushed the button around in a helical orbit , drained the last of his wine . This was her third banquet in two months . She 'd been named Volunteer of the Year here , and at the hospital as part of the Sunshine Patrol , and at the Red Cross as coordinator of their annual blood drive . The list stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . He was mediocre and made enough to put them in a three-bedroom house with a detached garage and a pool . Aboveground , which he always felt did n't really count . <p> Jean moved toward him now , reaching out to friends as they passed by . He watched the sway of her spangled minidress , her smile as she approached him . Kate had vacated her spot and edged toward the dessert table , fragile in her heels . Jean placed the statuette in front of him . <p> " So , what do you think ? " she said . He saw up close that the lucite was shaped like a flame , her name etched into a brass plate at the base . The statuette was covered with the fingerprints of those who had passed it around to admire it . Jeremy picked it up and added his own prints . <p> " Nice award , " he told her . She leaned against his table , her legs crossed at the ankle . <p> " How much could we get at a garage sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at someone across his shoulder . Her mastery , he thought , extended even to self-effacement . <p> " Well , there 's not much market in used accolades , " he said . " Congratulations anyway . " He smiled and leaned up to kiss her on the cheek . She squeezed his hand and crouched next to his chair . <p> " You look like one of my dinosaur exhibits sitting here , " she said , her voice quieter . " Boredasaurus roamed the earth in a wool-blend suit . " <p> " That 's all right , " he said . " At least if I 'm extinct I do n't have to stick around for the macarena . " He did a little dance in his chair . Above him , some tiny parasite extended its pincers in grainy black-and-white . <p> " I always thought you were a sucker for dance fads . " She laughed , then lifted her hand to cover the tiny chip in her front tooth . She had gotten it in 1982 , when a laundry truck had edged out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The seat belts held them , but Jean 's necklace , a large silver seahorse on a chain , flew up and nicked her tooth . It sometimes occurred to him that their whole collection of years was marked down in chips , tiny scars , the ghost lines of a few stitches . <p> He smiled and rubbed her arm . It pained him that he could not act better for these events , that he had lost over time first his interest in her accomplishments and then his ability to feign interest . From various podiums , she always called him her greatest accomplishment , their twenty-one years together , and then as if it were scripted the audience would smile and lean past their centerpieces to see him , and he would half-stand and wave as they applauded his existence . When the lights came up they would move toward him , toward Jean , in a steady parade of congratulations , as if their years were something else Jean had volunteered for , something else she 'd managed well . And she had managed well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring and summer when they would sit outside on the deck so he could gaze through his telescope at the night sky , watch lunar eclipses or the Perseid meteor shower , this ritual the last remaining scrap of his boyhood interest in science . Not once had she revealed her boredom with these nights , though she would always sit in the chaise longue , her knees drawn up , trying to read by the glow of a tiny book-light . <p> They walked holding hands toward the anteroom for sheet cake and more champagne . Jeremy wobbled a little , startled as loud piano chords launched into " The Twelve Days of Christmas . " Don West introduced the song by telling the crowd that the items in the twelve days added together would cost over eleven thousand dollars , assuming the rental fee for leaping lords . Everyone laughed . <p> Behind the long serving table stretched a display hall in dim light , featuring an exhibit on the history of flight in North Carolina . An oak propeller , slightly swaying , was suspended by fishline from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplane had been wedged next to the wall beside the water fountain , looking out of place on the orange carpet . Glass cases glinted , filled with papers and drawings and photos , with the leather caps of flying aces . Two red letters were burned out on the EXIT sign above the stairway , so that the sign just read IT . Jeremy laughed . <p> " What 's so funny ? " Jean asked . <p> " First you 're an it , then you 're an ex-it , " he said . <p> She rolled her eyes . " We 're cutting you off right now . Drink water , mister . " <p> " You better be nice to me , " he whispered , slipping his arm around her waist . " One day you 'll be an ex-it too . " She looked up and half-smiled . <p> " Have you seen this stuff ? " he said , stepping around the table toward the aviation display . <p> " Jeremy , that area is closed for the night , " Jean whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not going to hurt anything . " The only guard in the entire building was a small , plump blond woman in an ill-fitting blue uniform , whom he 'd seen standing on the first floor eating popcorn from a bag and watching the sparse traffic out the front windows . <p> " You are so bad , " Jean said , but followed him . <p> They walked past the display cases , looking at signed bicycle-shop bills of the Wright brothers , old airline uniforms , photos of long-buried heroes . When they reached the plane , Jeremy peered into the cramped cockpit . The left wing had been removed so the plane would fit next to the wall , and he was disappointed to see the controls were only fakes , stickers mounted on black plywood . He snapped open the door , bent inside , and sat in the pilot 's seat , straddling the stick . " Where are you flying off to ? " Jean said . <p> " I wish I had a good airplane story , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear would n't come down , or somebody got drunk and had to be restrained . Slid off the runway in the ice . One of those . " <p> " I hope we do n't have to restrain you beore the night is over , " Jean said . <p> " You have your airplane story , " he told her . " The four-hour wait in Denver ? Everyone traded ghost stories ? " <p> She nodded and smiled . " I 'd forgotten about that . " <p> " Every flight I 've ever had has been routine , " he said . " I might as well have lived before they invented the damn thing . " She leaned her arms on the windowsill , her face close to his . He looked at her , feeling almost cozy in this cramped space , wishing he had some reason to kiss her . <p> " Most people would consider a lifetime of routine flights lucky , " she said . <p> " Well , then , they do n't appreciate the value of having something to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be your airplane story . " <p> " Does n't count . We 're not flying . " He wrapped his fingers around the stick . " What kind of stories do you think people told about themselves before we had traffic jams or airplane crashes or computer viruses or all this stuff in the world ? " <p> She laughed and shrugged . " I do n't know . But you can tell me any story you want , Jeremy . " <p> He held the stick and pulled hard right , as if banking into a steep turn , an evasive maneuver . Anything he could think of to tell her seemed redundant by its everydayness , as if the whole history of their years together amounted to no more than a shopping list or a weekend at the beach . Anything he could remember had been recounted again and again at reunions and in the shoebox of faded slides they kept beneath the bed . All the stories were birthdays and vacations and promotions and parties . They could have been written for anyone . He banked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk at the museum and thought you were Snoopy ? " She laughed again . " That will be your story . " <p> He grinned and gave her a double thumbs-up to make her laugh more . This would be one of her stories , about him . Over the years , without meaning to , she had made him into her prop , a symbol of her stability . He heard her , at receptions and banquets , through the low hum of PA systems , chiseling him by her careful words into some kind of statue to her perseverance . Already , he knew , this story was hardening in some part of her mind . A few onlookers behind us , his silly thumbs-up , he was drunk , acting like Snoopy . No , not drunk ; tipsy was a better word . She did n't want anyone to think he had problems . His legs started to ache . He pressed the rudder pedals and found they were welded into place . From the other room , Don West played a fanfare over the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called out . She looked over her shoulder . <p> " I better get back , " she said . " You coming ? " <p> He shook his head . " You go on . " <p> Jean patted his arm . " Safe landing , " she said as she walked away . He watched the easy sway of her hips , the rhythm of her dress . She was , he knew , a very attractive woman , and other men thought him lucky to be with her . He considered how his forty-three years of living had brought him to be half-drunk and sitting in a crippled airplane watching his wife 's well-maintained body as she walked out to be toasted by people who were strangers to him . This felt like the punch line to some elaborate joke . <p> As Jeremy pulled himself from the cockpit , he felt an urgent fullness in his bladder . Downstairs by the coat racks , he remembered , they had passed a men 's room . He headed out through the back hallway , the orange carpet illuminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of electricity , glass cases displaying early light bulbs and Edisonphones and lengths of copper wire . Outside one case was a plastic box with rows of green and red buttons . He pushed one , and a painted plywood panel lit up with tiny bulbs to show the path of lightning across the sky to the ground . He pushed another , and a man 's recorded voice scratched through an overhead speaker , explaining the evolution of electrical generation and its importance to industry and the growth of America . Jeremy leaned close to the glass , watching the lights , hearing the calming , neutral voice explain the history of power and man 's harnessing of nature . <p> As he listened , his mind unearthed a glimmer from thirty years prior , ninth grade , when he 'd attended football camp at Chapel Hill . He 'd spent a week living in the dorm , sweating through his days in the damp air and dry grass of summer , running scrimmages and drills , drinking ice water from coolers . Near the end , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard rains pounded the practice fields . They ran shouting from the buses toward the high-rise dorm . The fastest among them  --  a big red-haired running back from Winston  --  sprinted to the door , laughing , his face streaked with mud , grabbed the pull handle , spasmed once , and then slammed to the concrete landing . He looked up blinking , as if he 'd been lifted and thrown there . Others followed , their arms jerked by the force of the electric current that had shorted out through the steel doorframe . They quickly discovered the pattern . Everyone barefoot or grounded in cleats was jolted , and everyone in sneakers was not . They took turns daring one another to touch the door , letting the current snap their elbows . <p> Jeremy had held back until someone dared him . He hesitated , remembering stories about the electric chair and how the murderers ' hair would smoke or their hearts explode . In the same instant he thought this , his palm touched the door , and something alive gathered inside his arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boys around him laughed as he heard profanity wrung from his own mouth , and then he stood looking at his tingling hand and the moment was over , his heart fluttering . He and the others pulled on their wet sneakers and formed a line , holding hands , grabbing those who were barefoot or in cleats , each grounded touch sending the feathery shock through the long extension of themselves , adding to the line until there were nearly forty of them . They whipped around the asphalt lot like skaters , linked by their hands , tracking victims , the air metallic with the smell of ozone . The rain soaked his clothes , his arms pulled and twisted , rib cage aching as they ran shouting through the rows of buses and around the hedges that surrounded the building , his feet sometimes pulled off the pavement . For half an hour they ran after one another . He could see them now , like the tiny lights reflected behind the display glass , the years charged , old memory chasing him down . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a greasy oval where his nose had been . He realized now that they could have been , all of them , electrocuted . A wire-service tragedy , page-three irony . But that seemed now what gave the story its meaning , that they had n't died and had n't known they could . More than anything else , he thought , reminiscence held all possibility of romance . He thought of rewriting the brochures for the museum to explain that this was all history was  --  understanding slathered on the messy past . The lights blinked out and the voice ran quiet . He still had to pee . <p> The low thumps and vibrations of full-blown dancing sounded from the banquet room behind him . He moved along the dim halls and onto the back stairs until he found the men 's room . As he washed his hands , he looked at himself in the narrow mirror , his skin greenish and sickly in the fluorescent light . He patted his hair and hook-shot his paper towel into the trash can . Near the elevator he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drags , feeling it buzz inside his head . <p> Across the way , an exhibit featured mannequins of pioneers posed near an orange plastic fire , holding cardboard skillets , coonskin caps perched crookedly on the heads of the men , the women in long dresses of rough fabric . He noticed that they were the type of mannequins on display in the hip , noisy stores of the mall  --  lithe and thin , their nipples erect . Jeremy laughed at this , then stepped over the Plexiglas partition that surrounded the exhibit . He straightened the caps of the two men , ran his finger along the fringe of their buckskin coats , hefted their rifles . The brown leaves under his feet were made of some thin synthetic cloth . He thought how it would look if he remained for the next school group passing through , how to explain the presence along the Oregon Trail of a middle-aged section manager in a wool suit and argyle socks . He wore in his hair an oily formula meant to take away his gray . This was Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had earned . Jeremy decided the fact that it was her idea ought to be pointed out in the self-guided tour pamphlet . He posed for a moment , as still as the alcohol would allow , pretending to warm his hands over the orange cellophane . He looked at the men around him , their still , chipped faces . <p> " Looks like a hard winter ahead , " he said , startling himself with the echo of his voice . He tried to imagine pioneer names for them , but could not think of any . As he ran through the list of the men he worked with , it amazed him how none of the names would fit : Stan , Rog , Anthony , Kevin , Stephan . Sissy , soft-handed names , he decided , then reached out and fingered the nipple of a pioneer woman through the gray fabric of her dress . She rocked a little on her stand . <p> " Can I help you , sir ? " For a moment , he felt the jolt of the steel door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the security guard shining a flashlight politely away from his face . She wore an oversized shiny blue coat and blue uniform-store clothes , her blond ponytail looped through the plastic adjuster of her hat , which read SENTRY SECURITY in bright red letters . She was chewing gum , her slight double chin appearing then disappearing . <p> " I 'm with the party upstairs , " Jeremy said . He moved past the fake campfire . " My wife ... " He let his sentence trail off . <p> " That your wife ? " She pointed the light at the pioneer mannequin . " She 's a little old for you . Maybe a hundred years . " There was no discernible humor in her voice . She was short , no more than five-one or-two . The warmth of a blush slowly crept into his face . He felt clumsy , exposed . When he tried to laugh , the sound came out like a small choke This was something else Jean was good at , the tiny performances that brought one through a day of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you ? " he said . <p> " Your name ? " the woman asked . <p> Jeremy started to pull out his wallet . He straightened up as he always did in dealing with police at traffic stops , as if good posture could keep him out of trouble . His billfold opened to a row of credit cards . <p> " I do n't care if you can drive or not , " the woman told him . " I just want to know your name . <p> " It 's Jeremy . Jeremy Barseleau . Yours ? " <p> " Celina DeFilece . It 's Italian , even though I do n't look it . " <p> " It 's pretty , though , like a little song . " <p> She nodded . " The same line you use on all the pioneer women . " Her small laugh sounded more like a sneeze . She motioned with the flashlight . " I guess my job is to tell you that you ought to come out of there . " <p> " And miss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not join in . He had never really known how to make people laugh . Somehow , his timing was off . <p> She held his hand as he stepped over the Plexiglas , her grip cool and strong , her hand tiny and rough . He thought of Jean with her large , red-nailed hands . He tried to imagine her hands unadorned  --  empty , like this woman 's , of color or jewelry . <p> He straightened his tie . " Thank you . Sorry for the trouble . " <p> She shrugged . " Gave me something to do . You should have resisted so I could shoot you . " <p> He smiled . " At least let me get you something to eat . " <p> " They got food up there ? " She clicked off her light , slipped it into her belt . <p> " I think they may have a little . About two banquet tables ' worth . " <p> She smiled , her teeth crooked and white . " If you insist . Get me some food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't arrest me . You 're just a play cop , are n't you ? " <p> " Well , you 're just a play party-guest . Otherwise you 'd be upstairs . Who are you avoiding ? " <p> By now , Jean would probably be looking for him . " I 'll get your food , " he said . <p> Upstairs , Jeremy loaded a plate with chicken wings , shrimp salad , canapes , a slice of brie , Watergate salad , and German chocolate cake . On the way down he grabbed two of the ribboned champagne bottles that lined the stairs . He carried his load down to the pioneer display and found Celina gone . He shielded his eyes against the track lights to make out the covered wagon and the pioneer woman in the shadows . This was the place , but she was nowhere around . <p> " Celina ? " he whispered as he made his way back through the dark halls , past old hay rakes and mattocks and plows , past colonial drawknives and rosin barrels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each display . It awed him , how many things people had thought of to invent . He wondered if there were a limited supply , if someday there would be nothing else to make , nothing else to think of or know . He imagined people standing around looking at each other and shrugging . <p> He found a rear stairway and walked up , balancing the food and bottles . At the top was a steel door , though he could not remember which floor he was on . The door opened out behind the awards table , unclaimed statuettes still scattered across it . Jean stood off a way holding the unlit cigarette she kept with her in an attempt to quit . A small circle of friends surrounded her . <p> " Well , look at you ! " she shouted . Jeremy walked toward her . " There is plenty , honey , you do n't have to hoard it . " Her group laughed . <p> Jeremy stopped and held the load of food as if someone had dumped it in his arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> She pointed her cigarette at the bottles . " Thirsty , too , looks like . " He hated this time of night , when after a few drinks she would draw laughs by teasing him , sketching their marriage by way of tiny jokes and asides . It was these nights when he could convince himself he was done with her , that their years had brought them to nothing . As he shifted the bottles under his arm , a bit of shrimp salad fell to the floor . <p> " Jeremy , listen , " she said , pulling him to a safe distance . She spoke low into his ear , her voice losing its practiced lightness  --  more real now , more worried . What he wanted , he sometimes thought , was for the breezy , public Jean to be his all the time . For their marriage to be the way it seemed when he sat in folding chairs and heard her talk about it over the faint squeal of microphone feedback . He wanted to marry the woman behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The mayor 's dance is at midnight , and I would like you there to turn me around the floor . " She fingered his wedding band . " I know these things are n't fun for you , but it 's the one favor I 'm asking . Please do n't disappear on me . " <p> " I 'm just looking at some of the displays , " he said . She smiled . She was really sweet , he knew . This was the consensus among their friends . <p> " See anything good ? " she asked . <p> " I watched a show about the way teenagers ignore death , " he said , " and I toured the hall of pioneer nipples . " <p> A look of small panic crossed her face . He was talking too loud . <p> " You 'll have to show me those sometime , " she said . <p> He nodded . " I 'd like to . " <p> " Go easy on the champagne , and do n't forget the dance , please , Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have n't I always been there when you needed me to ? " This was a line he 'd heard on a TV show somewhere . He stood close to her , speaking in a quiet voice . <p> " Yes , you have . " She squeezed his arm . " Come find me . " <p> " Midnight , " he said . " Got it . Promise I 'll be here . " He thought drunkenly of Cinderella . <p> He felt his way down the back stairs by the faint red glow of the fire escape signs . His steps gave a hushed echo on the stair skids , the thick base of the champagne bottle tapping the handrail as he descended . He walked through the halls , calling for Celina in a hoarse whisper . He passed mannequins dressed as Redcoats and as colonists with muskets and fake plastic horses , and others clothed as Rebels and Yankees . The hard , set faces were lit from above , the clothes too new-looking , as if they had come from Wal-Mart . Jeremy fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , showing them the twentieth-century miracle of his digital glow-in-the-dark wristwatch and his cellphone , asking if they had seen a blonde dressed as a cop . He told the plastic Yankees that they should not attack on Christmas Day . <p> Finally he found her , in a large room set aside for special visiting exhibits , the current one titled " The Atomic Age . " Celina sat cross-legged on a love seat inside someone 's re-created living room from 1955 , watching Milton Berle on a boxy black-and-white TV . Outside the fake window was a bomb shelter shaped like a small RV , air vent jutting upward , one wall cut away and replaced with Plexiglas , the olive-drab shelves stacked with Wheatena biscuits , Ritz crackers , and steel cans of water . He sat beside her , the vinyl upholstery squeaking beneath him , the two of them surrounded on three sides as though they lived in some fourth-grader 's diorama . <p> " You found me , " Celina said , smiling . He handed her the food , spilling a little on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had somehow failed her instead of doing her a favor . She lifted a forkful of Watergate salad to her mouth . He undid the foil and wire on the champagne and popped the cork . It ricocheted and landed on the end table , atop of copy of Life magazine with Dwight Eisenhower on the cover . <p> " You got him , " she said . " I come down here to goof off . Do n't tell . " <p> " Who would I tell ? " he said . " Hey , Uncle Miltie , see that she 's fired . " At this , she laughed out loud , as if he had finally hit some resonant spot . He watched her laugh , the way it just came out of her all at once . He decided that he loved this in her . On the tiny screen , Milton Berle was wearing a dress and trying to kiss Danny Kaye . The audience was howling . Celina chewed , drank from the bottle , then passed it to him , and he drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew long swallows until his eyes watered . He saw her with clarity as his drunkenness increased , saw the small imperfections of her nose and the thin , hard lines around her mouth . She tipped her hat back and leaned her head against the love seat , shutting her eyes against the lights . She stood up suddenly and changed the tape in the VCR hidden under the TV cabinet . Jack Benny flickered onto the gray screen , frowning and holding his violin . Across the hall , in another room , Jeremy could see more enlarged photos of microscopic creatures , the hairy legs and dangerous pincers . It surprised him that such a small world could be so fierce . <p> Celina drank . " Where 's wifey ? " she asked . This annoyed him , her calling Jean " wifey " as if subtly mocking him for being married to her . <p> " My wife , Jean , is upstairs , being awarded and feted . " <p> " Are you happily married ? Or do you secretly hate it ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sauce on the corner of her mouth . " I know your type . You think it 's smart to ask questions that put people on the spot . " <p> She shrugged . " I hate small talk . Just another name for bullshit . " <p> " To answer your question , I 'm happy if I do n't think about it too much . Married happiness is like , I do n't know ... an autonomic response . " <p> " What 's that mean ? " she asked . <p> " Like your heart beating or your eyes blinking . You do n't have to think about it . " <p> " Or do n't get to think about it , " she told him . As she said this , he was hit by recognition : this was their old furniture , his and Jean 's , or something very much like it , castoffs from his in-laws the first year they were married , when being poor felt like fun . He pictured their cramped apartment , the rusted , leaky toilet , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night , and how in the dark , wedged together in their bed , he would make Jean laugh by telling her that Harpo Marx was trapped in the wall . He looked around , remembering the low-slung aqua-colored vinyl couch , the coffee table shaped vaguely like an artist 's palette , the abstractly designed ceramic ashtrays . In the mock kitchen were Formica table and chairs , metal cabinets painted bright yellow , and vintage Tupperware displaying a Jell-O mold and green-bean casserole . Everything plastic , fake , more so even than it had been then . Preservation , he supposed , equaled history . <p> " My wife and I used to live here , " he said . " Except we did n't have a bomb shelter . " <p> Celina wiped her mouth . " You 're kind of a quirky guy . " <p> He shrugged . Jack Benny faded out , and a commercial for Texaco came on the screen . " And what about you ? " he said . <p> " I 'm not that quirky . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But are you married ? " <p> " I live with my boyfriend . He sells cars . He 's learning to play the drums . " <p> Jeremy nodded and looked at his watch . In twenty minutes the mayor 's dance would start , and Jean would be looking flor him . He closed his eyes a moment , weighing the drunkenness inside him . <p> " Bored with me already , huh ? " Celina said . " It 's the job , not me . The boredom just clings to me . " <p> " You are n't boring , " he said . " You plan to work this job all your life ? " <p> " No , " she said . " I want to be a nurse . Either that or euthanize dogs for a living . " <p> He looked at her . <p> " I 'm joking , " she said . " Except about the nurse part . Lighten up , Jerry . " <p> " Jeremy , " he said . On the screen , Dr. Joyce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dollar Question . Out the window , surrounding their bomb shelter , stretched a lawn of bright green Astroturf . <p> " I hate all this , the phony newness of everything , " Jeremy said . <p> " Hey , this stuff is forty years old . Older than me by a mile . " <p> " Old but new , " Jeremy said . <p> " You want older , like antique ? " Celina said . " Jerry wants to go back in time . " <p> He drank , and she wiped his chin with her finger . " Is n't that what everybody wants ? " he said . <p> " Not me , bub . Nothing back there I want . " <p> He grinned . " You 're the here and now , huh ? " <p> Celina drank from the champagne and handed it to him , then stood . " Come on , " she told him . " You want old , I 'll show you the off-limits stuff . " <p> She led him out of the Atomic Age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display on extinct mammals , past dugout canoes , mannequin conquistadors and explorers . They entered a door posted " Authorized Personnel Only . " Inside , Celina skimmed her flashlight along a row of empty glass cases to the back of the room , where an artificial cave had been built against one wall . The outside was unfinished , the concrete and wire mesh and fiberglass exposed ; the inside walls were textured and painted to look like limestone . Beneath Jeremy 's hand the mouth of the cave felt like the real thing , a solid , permanent opening into the earth . Somewhere above them , he heard the shuffle and murmur of the party , the faint bass notes of Don West 's keyboard . <p> " It 's a new exhibit they 're doing on early man or something , " Celina said . " We are n't supposed to be here . At least you 're not . " <p> It was approaching midnight . " I got ta go soon , " Jeremy said . Celina nodded . He undid his tie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooler , damp . The cave was at least twenty feet deep , the back wall no more than a black-painted sheet of plywood . He thought of the airplane with its fake controls . <p> " Where are the department-store cave dwellers ? " he asked . <p> " Still on order , I guess . All the mannequins come from either Indonesia or Pittsburgh . " <p> " The two seedbeds of civilization . " He stepped farther inside . On the floor were three metal plates where the mannequins would be bolted down . <p> " Kill the light , " he told her . She shrugged and clicked the flashlight , the bulb wire a faint orange glow behind the lens . He heard the jingle of her keys , the squeak of her leather hoister as she stepped over the ropes and toward him . Sounds came more fully to him now , the noise of the party upstairs muffled through a heating duct , carried along the currents of filtered air . His eyes pulsed in purple streaks and flashes against the dark . Celina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sleeve . <p> " This is weird , " she said . " I 'm glad I 'm not blind . I would hate that . " Jeremy heard through the faint whoosh of air the sounds of spoons stirring in coffee cups , champagne glasses clinking , Don West playing slow , intermittent chords on his synthesizer and talking to the crowd . There was a short crackle of applause , then a burst of laughing like noise rising out of a radio speaker . The rough wall of the cave came up behind him as he felt his way , and he let himself slide down , sitting on the hard floor . <p> " Where are you ? " Celina said . As his eyes adjusted , she became a faint blue-white glow . " Can we sit ? I 'm tired . " <p> " Here , " he said , taking her hand . He could smell on her a faint odor of garlic mixed with the champagne . As he raised his hand to her , his wristwatch moved like a firefly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his sleeve . The sounds of the party faded in and out , layers of laughing and dancing and music and silence . The air vent blew down on them , cooling their skin . It would be good to have a fire , he thought . Celina sat next to him , their shoulders touching . <p> " This is so cool , " she said . " I can almost see you . Like I can , but only sorta , like a really faint star at night . " <p> " You smell good , " he told her . " You smell like food . " <p> She laughed . " You just want everybody to like you , do n't you ? " she said . He heard her moving around , settling in . <p> " Same as anyone . That could be the theme of this entire museum . Except the dinosaurs and insects ; they do n't give a shit . " <p> " I like you pretty good , " she said . " You gave up a whole party to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , groping a little to find it . Above him he heard off-key singers trying drunken verses of " All I Want for Christmas , " and he pictured the hand-held mike making its way around the room , past his empty seat , Jean sitting , twisting her napkin , watching the stairwell doors . He spoke quickly . <p> " Ask me some more questions , " he said . " Ask anything . " He wanted to tell her every thought that came into his mind , as if by words he might make her understand who a Jeremy Barseleau is , who he had become in forty-three years . <p> " Hmmm . " She was silent . " Tell me one time when something really broke your heart . Or someone . " She patted his hand again . <p> The question panicked him a little . He tried to think of Jean in some setting that had moved him deeply , brought him to real sadness . There was the time not long after their marriage , in a walk-in clinic at the hospital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he could remember only the long first days of silences and averted glances that came after , how Jean had joked them out of themselves until through time the loss seemed only a mild disappointment , like a picnic rained out . Since then , it had never seemed that they really needed children . He ran through other things in his mind , old girlfriends , sad movies he might have seen , deaths of distant relatives , watching his parents as they aged . All these things seemed remote now , fuzzy around their edges . Then he remembered something , and quickly turned to Celina . <p> " This will sound silly , " he said . <p> " Yeah , probably so . Just try me . " <p> " It 's a little thing really . Once , Jean and I were at this company picnic at Hagenstone Park . The usual : cooking burgers , swimming in the lake , volleyball . I was hot and sat under a tree and watched this other family , not part of our group . " Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> She took his hand and squeezed it . " I do n't care . Tell the story . " " Anyway , they were all doing the usual stuff too , and the kids were bawling over fruit punch or something , and I saw what must have been an uncle , an overweight guy in tattoos and this mesh shirt and tinted glasses , he 's away from everyone , with the family dog , some little mutt on a leash . The guy has the leash hooked around his ankle , and he 's inside this narrow patch of shade trying to work into the ground this big corkscrew he could use to tether the dog . " <p> Jeremy took a deep breath , feeling words gather in him . In the dim quiet echoed the sound of a synthesized fanfare upstairs , then the deep tones of the mayor 's voice . He could feel Jean 's waiting . Words spilled out of him . <p> " I just thought about this guy , sweating , digging into the dirt , tearing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's going to have a heart attack , just so the dog could rest in the shade . I mean , a damn dog . It seemed like he had tethered himself to the dog , not the other way around . No one even noticed the guy . No one helped him . " <p> He stopped , feeling his voice shake . " Jesus , I sound like a Lassie episode . " He heard applause , the mayor having finished his speech . <p> " I love that , " Celina said . " I feel like I love that man . " <p> Jeremy nodded . " It 's weird . That 's what I felt too . Like he deserved something from me . " <p> She was quiet a moment . " Well , now he has it . You told about him . " <p> He wanted to tell her everything , about the man and the dog , about the electrified boys in the rain , all the small moments of his past . Beside him he could just make out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried grasses . He felt the weight of his drunkenness , allowing his head to tilt against her shoulder . From this angle he could see high on the opposite wall the crude scratches of cave drawings , dark as rust at the edges of his vision . Upstairs , the keyboard started " One O'Clock Jump , " and feet shuffled across the floor above them , through the layers of insulation and particle board and the concrete and fiberglass of the cave . He heard laughter , the faint wheeze of breath through Celina 's nose , her fingers smoothing his hair . <p> " You 'll be all right , " she said . " Sleep it off . " <p> He reached back behind him and found with his fingertips the indentations of other drawings , rough figures etched and painted into the stone , his hand careful as it traced the shallow lines , the thin , smoothed ruts . He could hear his own name then , called in soft echoes , the laughing that followed it . He imagined Jean with the cordless mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice altered and modulated , his name something far-off and unrecognizable . The sound faded against the rushed pulse of his blood , the scant sigh of Celina 's breathing . He held to the sound of his name as his fingers traced the jagged lines on the wall . He wondered what tales they told , of hunts or kills or defeats , and in what language they might be written , some ancient language lost to history , telling stories without words . <p> <p> By BRAD BARKLEY <p>
