Section : U.S. News <p> Awash in red ink , Washington wants to force others to pick up the tab for new programs <p> As Congress staggers toward a much delayed adjournment , lawmakers are searching for ways to please the voting public that do not deplete the federal Treasury . Since there is no extra money to spend , a new era of buck-passing has begun : Congress is deciding to make others - businesses , state and local governments - spend their money on goals set by Washington . It 's no-frills , off-the-rack government . <p> The impulse to impose federal mandates on others will grow in the future as voters demand cleaner water , quieter airports and broader health insurance . In addition , momentum is building on Capitol Hill to impose new regulations on industries as diverse as finance , fishing and cable television . Fees will go up on many government services , from flood insurance to grazing rights on federal land . " Pay as you go " will be a watchword , with lawmakers required to match new expenditures with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' says Norman Ornstein , a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute . " And when the two major weapons of government , the budget itself and the tax system , have effectively been disarmed , they will turn to the third weapon of government , which is regulation . ' <p> National politics in the ' 90s could be dominated by one question : Who pays for what benefits ? The answer will dramatically reshape municipal and state finances and deeply affect the nation 's competitive position as businesses try to cope with new expenses decreed by Washington . This trend has evoked cries of anguish from offices where the bill is landing . John Sloan , president of the National Federation of Independent Business , complains : " It is inappropriate for government to promote programs - often misguided programs - that it ca n't afford and to simply shift them onto the back of business . ' <p> That 's an argument President Bush supports , and he has used threats of a veto to bolster his friends in the business community . On child-care legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from proposals setting national standards for local facilities but accepted a provision directing the states to establish their own health-and-safety requirements . Congress and the White House have been unable to reach a compromise , however , on the 1990 Civil Rights Act , where 11th-hour fighting centers on how broad the antidiscrimination edicts will be and what kind of liability businesses will face . If Bush ends up vetoing the final measure , the veto will almost certainly be sustained by Congress . But the issue will come back . <p> Despite these arguments , the trend is gathering strength from a changing political environment . Ironically , the move to mandates has been pushed along , in part , by the fiscal policies Ronald Reagan said were designed to get government off people 's backs . The public is also demanding more government services , from caring for their children to cleaning up toxic wastes . The savings and loan scandal has increased calls for greater government vigilance over business , and Representative Dan Glickman , a Kansas Democrat , says : " I sense the public is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . ' Of course , Americans do not want to pay higher taxes for these services , and Democrats remain vulnerable to " tax and spend " charges by the Republicans . As a result , some younger Democrats , not wedded to New Deal and Great Society notions of centralized government , hope the private sector and local government can take up the slack . The Democrats ' prospects , notes Representative Ron Wyden of Oregon , could turn on their ability " to create opportunities for people without just creating new agencies and new programs . ' That approach takes many forms : <p> Mandated benefits . After years of playing defense during the Reagan era , liberal Democrats , prompted by organized labor , took the offensive when Bush came into office , advancing a long series of social programs organized around the idea that business would pay . Their first measure , raising the minimum wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 , produced Bush 's first veto . Later , both sides agreed on a compromise raising the wage to $4.25 , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So is family leave , a proposal requiring many businesses to grant up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off for employes with a family emergency , such as a new baby or a sick parent . Bush vetoed the measure last June , saying he approved of the policy but objected to a mandate that could cost business roughly $200 million a year . Congress upheld the veto , but Representative Marge Roukema , a New Jersey Republican , warned her colleagues that " you 'll have to answer to your constituents on this . ' Business has fought so hard against mandated benefits because it fears passage of some worker benefits will open the door to legislation requiring group-health-insurance plans for the nation 's 31.8 million uninsured workers - at a potential cost of $33 billion annually . <p> Business behavior . Congress is eager to control a wide range of business practices that impinge on public health , safety and economic security . The main event in this field is the clean-air bill , now in its final stages of negotiation . Bush managed to tone down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was too harsh on industry , but the final version will still require much greater efforts by car manufacturers to reduce smog and impose costly cleanup standards on electric utilities that help cause acid rain . Private-sector expenses could reach between $51 billion and $91 billion a year . <p> Other mandates are designed to help the government cover its deficits . The budget bill contains a provision requiring pharmaceutical companies to give discounts to medicaid clients purchasing drugs . The cost : $2 billion a year . <p> A consensus farm bill contains a raft of new regulations , including the first national standard for " organically grown " produce not exposed to chemicals . To help monitor the impact of chemicals , farmers would be required to keep records of pesticide use . A provision banning the export of some farm chemicals was dropped under pressure from the industry , but it will be revived . <p> Re-regulation . Nowhere have Reagan 's free-market theories taken a greater beating than in the banking world . With the government bailout of the S &L; industry likely to cost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble , sweeping changes are in the works . Congress favors sharp increases in premiums paid by banks to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , whose reserves are dwindling sharply . A strong push will come next year to limit the amount of insurance available to any individual depositor , and to base insurance premiums paid by each bank on its performance . The aim : To discourage bankers from taking unsound risks with government-guaranteed deposits . <p> Another trend will expand the application of " user fees " - making those who use government facilities pay for them . A prime example is contained in the Senate version of the budget bill . It would impose $3 fees for each takeoff and landing at a major airport to pay for improvements . That same measure also requires the Department of Transportation to establish a national noise-abatement standard for airports ; now , each community sets its own . While Bush remains committed to deregulation , he accepted a bill reducing the commercials shown on children 's TV programs , and cable TV could also face tougher scrutiny . Individual rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantaged , Congress is focusing on legal measures that would ease discrimination and enhance opportunity . But the fights will be as bitter as the one that surrounded the Civil Rights Act . Bush charged that Congress would require companies to employ hiring quotas to avoid litigation - a charge denied by supporters - but his hand was clearly strengthened by the Senate election in Louisiana , where David Duke , an outspoken foe of affirmative-action programs , tallied 44 percent of the vote . " The civil-rights bill caused a lot of liberals considerable heartburn , ' says one Southern Democrat . " This is the sort of thing that helped catapult David Duke into the limelight . ' State and local responsibilities . Officials outside Washington have long complained that Congress keeps adding new clients to the medicaid program , while the states must keep picking up a large share of the cost . Last year , the nation 's governors asked for a two-year ban on medicaid mandates , saying they were impairing the ability to finance education and other critical services . But some current proposals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion in medicaid obligations . <p> Washington has long set standards for other governments , but federal funds to help fulfill those aims are now running out , leaving states and cities holding the bag . One costly example is the sewage-treatment program , started almost 20 years ago with 75 percent of the cost borne by the federal government . By next year , the federal share will drop to zero . But the mandate for clean water remains . That forces states and cities to pick up an estimated $69 billion tab . <p> Creative financing . In a little noticed vote last week , the House approved a plan that would more than quadruple fees paid by ranchers to feed their cattle on federal lands . Representative Mike Synar , an Oklahoma Democrat , says the government has been selling such assets at " fire sale " prices for far too long , and promises in future Congresses to press for increased fees paid by miners , loggers and commercial concessionaires in national parks . <p> The era of mandates clearly holds sizable risks . Local governments could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Businesses fear the loss of competitiveness against foreign companies that do not have to clean up their wastes or pay minimum wages . But tight budgets could also liberate Congress to spend more time restructuring and supervising government - trying , in the words of Rutgers University political scientist Ross Baker , " to avert disaster , rather than simply perform post-mortems on catastrophes . ' If moderates in both parties can agree on a common goal - compassionate efficiency - Washington might find its way toward a new governing consensus . Where the push for new federal mandates will come : <p> The battle over federal programs and regulations will intensify in the next Congress . Here are some of the broad areas of economic and governmental activity that legislators will be seeking to change : Worker benefits : Bush vetoed a parental-leave bill this year , but the issue will come back . The measure would require employers to grant workers three months ' unpaid leave for a child 's birth , serious illness or the illness of a family member . Estimated cost : $200 million a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minimum wage ; Congress wants to raise it from $4.25 an hour after 1992 . Health care : Senator Edward Kennedy 's proposal for mandatory health insurance for all workers will be back . Congress says it could cost the business community $33 billion a year . And governors will fight federal expansion of medicaid , for which states share substantial costs . Bank regulation : To avert a taxpayer bailout of the federal deposit-insurance fund , Congress wants to impose higher insurance premiums and tougher capitalization standards on banks . The industry balks at further regulation by Congress . Insurance reform : Life-insurance companies are regulated by states , but an increase in failed insurers is prompting some lawmakers to consider putting the industry under tougher federal standards . The insurance firms see nothing wrong with the present arrangement . *** Rebellion of the liberal governors : <p> Governors across the nation - including liberals who traditionally supported the policy goals of congressional Democrats - say Washington has saddled them with intolerable burdens . These Democrats , all seeking re-election , share a common plea : " No new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan , he championed federal activism . As governor , though , Blanchard wants more flexibility . He 's angry at new federal education mandates that he must implement without any new federal aid - and that take resources away from his pet programs . Mario Cuomo : The New Yorker has led the campaign against attempts in Washington to cut back federal tax deductions for state and local taxes . He argues this policy would harm states ' and localities ' abilities to raise the revenues they need to cope with new federal regulations and mandates . Bill Clinton : The Arkansan , as former chairman of the National Governors ' Association , led his colleagues in seeking a moratorium on further expansion of medicaid , which would cost states $2 billion more . And he fought imposition of many new requirements on how states spend money for day care . <p> Drawing : No caption , STEVE McCRACKEN FOR USN &WR; <p> Picture : James Blanchard , DUANE BELANGER - DETROIT NEWS <p> Picture : Mario Cuomo , STEVE JACOBS - AP <p> Picture : Bill Clinton , JOANNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gest , Dorian Friedman and Gary Cohen <p>
