Old bones , shrewd deals , and engineering feats result in a new display at the American Museum <p> The time is about 150 million years ago ; the place , a sparsely forested plain in an area that will one day become the arid mountains and deserts of western North America . A female Barosaurus , one of the largest animals ever to have walked the earth , and her offspring are peacefully feeding on plants . Suddenly , their foraging is cut short by the appearance of a hungry carnivore , Allosaurus . The lone hunter knows better than to attack the sixty-ton mother ; pivoting , it rushes instead at the terrified baby . The young quarry attempts to hide behind its mother , dodging both her lashing tail and the Allosaurus 's deadly teeth and claws . In a final effort to protect her young , the Barosaurus rears up to a height of some fifty feet to fend off the attacker with her powerful forelegs or crush it under the weight of her immense body . <p> What is the sequel to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and repels or kills the predator . Or perhaps the agile Allosaurus rips into the baby and proceeds to devour it as the mother flees in panic . <p> The effort to imagine dinosaurs as living organisms , facing challenges similar to those that confront animals today , was the inspiration for the new exhibit in the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Hall , or Rotunda , of the American Museum of Natural History in New York . A mother Barosaurus towers above the Rotunda 's floor , protecting her young from a predator . The dramatic and controversial pose gives viewers an idea of the dynamism that can reside in fossil relics . The effect produced by the most modern fabrication and fossil-mounting methods heightens both the romantic history and the grandeur of the fossils . <p> The story of how the Barosaurus came to the American Museum starts almost a hundred years ago . Much of the Museum 's huge collection of dinosaur remains was assembled in the late 1800s and early 1900s , during what has been called the golden age of dinosaur exploration . When a mother lode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum and other natural history institutions in North America , competing openly to acquire extensive collections and discover new species , began a " bone rush . " <p> Under the direction of Henry Fairfield Osborn , the first chairman of the Museum 's Department of Vertebrate Paleontology , veteran bone hunters Walter Granger , Barnum Brown , and William Diller Matthew sent tons of fossils to New York . During the golden age , so much material was excavated that many specimens collected as long as a century ago still have not been thoroughly studied , prepared , or placed on public exhibition . Huge bones , some of them in their original wooden shipping cases , remain stored in the Museum 's labyrinthine basement . <p> The dinosaurs in the Rotunda mount were found in the Morrison Formation , a fossil-rich rock unit stretching from New Mexico to Montana . This formation has yielded many remains of sauropods  --  the huge quadrupedal plant eaters , including Barosaurus and its relatives , that lived mainly in the Jurassic period , some 213 to 144 million years ago . Barosaurus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the adult and young on display are the only publicly exhibited specimens of these dinosaurs . The reconstructed adult , which is unusually complete for any dinosaur specimen known  --  80 percent of the material is original-is also the most complete specimen of a Barosaurus ever collected . <p> The adult was unearthed between 1912 and 1914 in what is now Dinosaur National Monument in Utah . It might have ended up as spare parts divided among three different institutions if not for the foresight and perseverance of Barnum Brown , the American Museum 's foremost dinosaur collector . <p> About 1919 , the heyday of collecting at this Utah site was drawing to a close when the principal excavator , Earl Douglass , of Pittsburgh 's Carnegie Museum , discovered two remarkably well preserved sauropod skeletons . One of the skeletons went to the Smithsonian Institution , the other to the University of Utah . Later , when the University of Utah needed parts of a Diplodocus for a display , it traded a section of the Barosaurus tail to the Carnegie Museum for neck parts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Barosaurus . <p> As a result , the bones of the rare Barosaurus were dispersed to three different institutions . Barnum Brown , recognizing the skeleton 's importance , came up with a plan to unite the bones in New York , even though the American Museum owned none of the material and had not even participated in its excavation and preparation . In 1929 , Brown negotiated with the three institutions in an effort to consolidate the specimen in New York . According to some of his original correspondence , the deal called for a combination of fossil trades and cash payments between the American Museum , the Carnegie , the University of Utah , and the Smithsonian . In the end , Brown 's bargaining helped the American Museum acquire the bones for far less than it would have cost to collect them in the field . <p> The Roosevelt Rotunda mount reflects the legacy of many early paleontologists and the efforts of contemporary scientists and fossil preparators . During our lunches here at the American Museum , Gene Gaffney , Lowell Dingus , and I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of mounting a sauropod on its hind legs . The first drawings were blurry sketches made on damp napkins . In the beginning , none of us really believed that our wishful speculation would eventually lead to the reconstruction in the Rotunda . <p> After developing a preliminary design , we got to work . All the original bones , stored in the collection for sixty years , had to be cleaned and repaired . Many of their glue joints had cracked , and some of the pieces were scattered . Only about a fifth of the skeleton was missing , but each of these pieces , including the skull , several limb bones , and part of the tail , had to be modeled to complete the skeleton . <p> The replacement parts were modeled in Toronto , Canada , by Research Casting International , an organization that specializes in fabricating and mounting dinosaur casts . Under the direction of Peter May , the technicians at Research Casting sculpted each individual missing bone in clay , basing the shapes on the remains of more completely known close relatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to John S. McIntosh of Wesleyan University , the premier scholar of sauropod relationships , this better-known Jurassic sauropod so closely resembles Barosaurus that many partial skeletons and isolated bones long considered by paleontologists to be the remains of the rather common Diplodocus may actually belong to Barosaurus . <p> The weight of the original Barosaurus bones  --  a single vertebra weighs up to 200 pounds  --  would have made mounting the actual fossils impossible without thick structural supports . In addition , the pose of the adult Barosaurus in its rearing stance of fifty feet above the Rotunda floor demanded the lightest of materials . So , after the modelers had sculpted the missing elements , they made a duplicate of the Barosaurus bones by coating them with latex , which , when cured , formed a rubber mold . These molds were cast with polyurethane foam to provide sturdy but light replicas of the original fossils . Those that would stand near the ground were cast in higher-density and more durable materials , while those higher up were made of lighter substances . The weight of the neck vertebrae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living Barosaurus . The sauropod solution was the development of large pleurocoels , or air spaces , in the vertebrae , which lightened the bones without compromising strength . The extreme complexity of these vertebrae made them the most difficult part of the skeleton to mold and cast . <p> The construction of the juvenile sauropod presented its own problems . The only material in our collection consisted of some neck vertebrae and a crushed skull collected at Howe Quarry in north-central Wyoming . Discovered and excavated by Barnum Brown , Howe Quarry was one of the richest accumulations of dinosaur remains ever found . Unfortunately , most of the material found was disarticulated , lying in a large jumble of bones , so determining what bones belonged to what animal was problematic . <p> Because the juvenile Barosaurus is so fragmentary , most of the body needed to be sculpted in clay and then cast . Bone shapes and proportions were determined from more complete skeletons of closely related species . However , juvenile and baby animals are not just miniature adults ; many of the differences that distinguish an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the young . In the process of growth , bones change not only in size but also in shape and in relation to other bones in the skeleton , much as puppies ' bodies grow at a relatively faster rate than their paws . Structural transformations , such as the appearance of antlers in adult deer , may also arise at various points . To reconstruct the skeleton of the young Barosaurus , we have attempted to use what little information we have concerning the body proportions and anatomical structure of these animals . <p> The third animal in the grouping , the sprinting Allosaurus , was the easiest to fabricate . Thanks to the discovery of a remarkable deposit , the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry in central Utah , almost every bone in the skeleton is known . During the thirty years that it has been excavated by Jim Madsen , of the University of Utah , the quarry has produced the remains of scores of Allosaurus individuals of different size classes . Some paleontologists suspect that this Allosaurus graveyard is a remnant of a particularly dangerous river crossing or quicksand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allosaurus in its dynamic running posture was a more difficult task . Special steel , chosen in consultation with a structural engineer , was needed to create the armature , or supports . The steel at the ankle of the Allosaurus had to be strong so as to support the animal at an extreme angle from only a single point . The armature along the spine and the tail needed to be light but rigid . The finished product is an almost invisible framework strong enough to support fifty pounds hung from the tip of the tail with no deflection . <p> Finally , we had to choose what kind of base to mount the animals on . Because we do not know exactly what kind of terrain this battle may have been played out on 150 million years ago , we opted for a purely aesthetic choice . What better than a replica of actual fossil-producing rocks ? During the summer of 1991 , Gene Gaffney and Peter May located a likely site , a small hillock in the Paleocene Tullock Formation in eastern Montana . Moving a fragile clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort , so a thin layer of latex rubber was sprayed over the terrain to form a large sheet mold . The mold was then sent to the shop of Research Casting International in Toronto , where it was cast and painted . This exact replica of a small piece of the Montana prairie now forms the base of the New York exhibit . <p> Probably the most controversial aspect of our mount is the pose of the dinosaurs themselves . Was Barosaurus capable of standing on its hind legs ? Would it have protected its young in this fashion ? And would the Allosaurus have launched such an attack ? Although much has been written recently about the behavior and capabilities of these Mesozoic giants , little actual evidence regarding their behavior and physical limitations can be determined from the bones themselves . While issues such as the diet , color , physiology , and behavior of various dinosaurs hold great appeal , any pronouncements on the habits of animals that went extinct more than 66 million years ago are highly speculative . Rigorous scientific tests of many current theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossils . So , while scenes like ours may seem spectacular and seductive , beware ! They represent only one of the many possible scenarios that may have occurred 150 million years ago . Because they have long vanished from the earth , leaving no close living relatives that we can observe in the wild , the giant sauropods will always retain much of their mystery . <p> PHOTO : Sauropod bones are embedded in rocks of the Morrison Formation in Dinosaur National Monument , Utah .
