Life has many quirks , " Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan is fond of saying . One of the strangest for Farrakhan was sharing a stage last week in Baltimore with a number of African Americans who usually steer clear of him , including Jesse Jackson and Malcolm X 's widow Betty Shabazz , who has declared her belief that Farrakhan played a role in her husband 's assassination three decades ago . But the person who stirred the most controversy by sitting at Farrakhan 's elbow was the man who invited him : Benjamin Chavis , the chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People . <P> Farrakhan 's presence at the N.A.A.C.P.-sponsored event , a 2 1/2-day gathering of 100 African-American leaders in Baltimore , aggravated criticism of Chavis ' attempts to revitalize the 85-year-old civil rights group by taking a more radical posture . In a speech at the meeting , he lashed out bitterly at his critics : " I did n't realize that sisters and brothers could be so envious , so jealous and so spiteful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out solutions to social and economic problems . " If we can come out of here with a health-care strategy . . . that would be effective , " said the Rev. Al Sharpton . " Otherwise , it was just a revival meeting . " His fear was justified . The summit produced mostly rhetoric that underscored the risk of Chavis ' strategy . By moving the group away from its integrationist tradition and embracing black nationalism , Chavis may alienate the sources of financing that the cash-strapped group desperately needs . <P> In fact the meeting seemed more a declaration of defiance against anyone who had objected to Farrakhan 's participation . " We do n't get in your family business , you stay out of ours , " Farrakhan shouted at a Sunday-night rally at Baltimore 's historic Bethel A.M.E. Church , threatening widespread boycotts of any corporations that withdraw support of the N.A.A.C.P. because of his presence at the summit . " We will march on you like you 've never been marched on before , " he said . " We will turn you inside out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly painful lack of support was from African-American leaders themselves . Though 20 members of the Congressional Black Caucus were invited , the only black elected officials to attend were Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke and Congressmen Kweisi Mfume of Maryland and Donald Payne of New Jersey . Jackson was the only representative from any of the other major black civil-rights organizations to show up . Chavis seemed to be alluding to absentees as well as critics when he declared , " The last time I checked my back , it was someone of African descent that put the dagger in and twisted it . "
