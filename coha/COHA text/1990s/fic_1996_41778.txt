It never happened . <p> It could not have happened . <p> It could not have happened that at a crowded congress of the Second International held in a resort hotel on the shores of Lake Catano in the foothills of the Swiss Alps , alongside a snow-fed lake with waters of such pure , crystalline blue that even in the very center one could peer straight down and clearly see the fluid shadows of the waters ' ripples speckling the rocks at the bottom , the delegates from the socialist parties of the world gathering in clots in the hallways , doing the real business of the congress there , with urgent imprecations , hands grasping forearms , voices dropped almost to whispers and glances over their shoulders , while upstairs an overworked chambermaid with varicose veins , Madame Robert , flicked a sheet in the air , sending motes of dust dancing in the afternoon sunshine , that Comrade Rosa Luxemburg and Comrade Antonio Gramsci limped past each other . <p> It never happened that Luxemburg , who had been detained after her speech by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to merely say that they had spoken with her , yes , individually , personally , at last signaled to her companion with her eyes , who worked his way through the knot of people surrounding her , laid a paternal hand on her arm , said , " Rosa , you must ... " and Rosa allowed herself to be led away , departing the Geneva Room at 2:52 in the afternoon , while at 2:51 Comrade Gramsci had sneezed , futilely searched his pockets for a handkerchief , and , having wiped his nose surreptitiously with the back of his hand , bowed his head and hurried through the crowded corridor to ascend to his room on the fifth floor to fetch one , so that , two-thirds of the way along , the two of you would pass each other . <p> No , it could not have happened . <p> On March 10 , 1912 , at eight minutes to three in the afternoon , Rosa Luxemburg was in her apartment on Lindenstrasse in Berlin , preparing a lecture for the Party School , thumbing. through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yields empire/ To another ; no one will yield it who has gained it by force ... , the same volume that she will drop into her purse when she hears the footsteps coming up the stairs of the house in Neukoelln to take her to her death six years later ; and Gramsci was a twenty-one-year-old , a poverty-stricken Sardinian student eating his first meal in three days , a plate of spaghetti con olio , at a trattoria on the Via Pereigia in Turin , reading a linguistics text as he ate , at a table just a little bit too high for him , so that his arms ached slightly from the odd angle at which they had to be maneuvered . At the next table a father moaned and patted his belly , pushed his chair back from the table , then urged his plump daughters to eat dessert , accompanying his coaxings with tugs at their flesh , they were too thin , altogether too thin , his dumplings , his darlings . The coy daughters protested ; the padre signaled the waiter to clear away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring lamb , the half-flask of wine . Later , limping home alone in a sharp wind with his half-empty belly ( why does one feel the cold so much more when one is hungry ? ) , Gramsci tried to name the force that allowed him to watch the remains of the rich man 's dinner being taken away while he still hungered : a dog , a dumb brute , would have leapt for it , seized the lamb in his teeth . The dog would have been a better socialist than I am , he thought . <p> No , Comrade Luxemburg does not pass Comrade Gramsci as she heads down the corridor , on her way to sit next to Karl Liebknecht at dinner , on her way to dine with him and twelve Judases , on her way to the unprecedented , the incredible 4th of August , 1914 , when the men she thought of as her comrades will vote for war appropriations , so that the workers of Germany can kill and in turn be killed by the workers of Italy and France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few weeks later when she and Clara Zetkin will sit in her parlor , four feet in scuffed slippers resting on the fender before the fire , debating , not the woman question , not organizational questions of the party , but whether laudanum or prussic acid would be a better way to go : because mass murder has become a boring monotonous daily business ; on her way to listening to the whistle of the 3:19 train carrying Mathilde away from her , in the prison where she was locked up for her opposition to the war ( If they freed me from this prison / if that railroad train was mine /you bet I 'd move it on /a little further down the line/far from Folsom Prison ... ) ; she will promise Sonja Liebknecht to go to Corsica with her after the war ( On high , nothing except barren rock formations which are a noble grey ; below , luxuriant olive trees , cherry trees , and age-old chestnut trees .

But still I spray-paint on the walls of the Hotel Leveque a slogan that wo n't be heard for fifty-odd years hence : " All power to the imagination " I imagine that in those days when we did n't yet have a name for ourselves , when the only words were handicapped , lame , deformed , hunchback , dwarf ; cripple , when the only words were silence , that we could speak . <p> I imagine that Comrade Luxemburg stares , looks away , but then laughs at herself for doing so : not out loud , not a full-throated , rich deep laugh , but only a laugh of mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turns , smiles , as you or I might do , passing each other in the corridor at a meeting filled with ABs . <p> She stops , stretches out her hand , says , " We have n't met . I 'm Rosa Luxemburg . " <p> " Of course , " he mutters , " yes , of course , " stretching out his hand in return , conscious of the fact that it 's the one he used in the absence of a handkerchief . <p> " And you ? " she says , helping out the flustered young man . He gives his name . " Let 's talk , " she says . <p> After dinner , when the coffee 's served , they meet out on the verandah . Of course , the stone benches out there are backless , and so they 'll schlepp three chairs out  --  one to prop their feet on , which otherwise would dangle above the ground . <p> " So , " Rosa asks right out , " has your disability made difficulties for you , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the workers  --  trust me <p> She nods , she knows . The wound on the outside , so that strangers on a train pick you to tell their tale to . <p> " But they fear it , too , " she supplies . <p> " Yes , they fear it , too .

Because of all those years of her growing up when it seemed that she was destined to be permanently outside the realm of desire , his words make her a bit prickly . If she were honest with herself about this  --  although she could n't be  --  she 'd admit that it was one of the things that led her to socialism : that it was the place where her strength of mind , of character , could overcome her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only lets herself know that she felt freedom here , a freedom she could n't feel anywhere else . <p> Comrades , I want you to go on but this conversation has grown awkward , studded with anachronisms , impossible to write . All power to the imagination ? As difficult a slogan to put into practice as All power to the soviets . <p> And although I want to holler back through time , " Please , speak to each other , " I can not let you know what 's to come . Mussolini is not yet a fascist , he has not yet become a man of steel , a man who will slap cold water on raw morning flesh , his chest puffed out like an enormous steam engine ; the masses are a woman , he will say , and , at a certain moment , when , haranguing them from a balcony , he feels their submissive spirit reach up towards him , he will strip off his shirt to show those muscles like iron bands , jut forward that great leonine head , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman head chiseled in marble . Hitler is still nothing more than a gleam in the evil eye of history . He has not yet spun that web of propaganda where disease , prostitution , the caftaned Jew lurking in the alley waiting to defile the Aryan woman , the suffocating perfume of our modern eroticism , the degenerates contaminating the healthy and passing on their defective genes to their offspring , blur together and become one . He has not yet declared that Germany must become a healthy state . Kommandant Koch of Buchenwald has not yet said , There are no sick men in my camp . They are all either well or dead . Mussolini , Hitler , Koch , will understand : the worship of the healthy body , the fear of us , is the taproot of fascism . <p> But Rosa , sober Rosa , leans forward through time and reprimands me : In the beginning was the act . No , they ca n't yet speak to each other . We do n't yet exist . We are the sons and daughters of fascism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So I try again . I fast-forward through the next four bloody years of history : the soldiers look like Keystone Kops as they rush out of their trenches , grimace , fall to the ground , and the next wave of soldiers rises , and does the same , and the next does the same , and the next does the same and the next does the same and the next does the same , until some twenty-two million have died and I hit the " play " button and return to normal speed . <p> Rosa walks out the doors of Breslau Prison , she speaks at the rally in Berlin , she writes , There is order in Berlin ... your order is built on sand . But she never takes that last dazed , lurching walk through the corridors of the Hotel Eden , she never is found , a bloated marshmallow of a corpse , eyeless , bobbing against the locks of the Landwehr Canal . Instead she escapes to the Soviet Union , from there she hopscotches to New York . Antonio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy before your arrest , but even in the world of the imagination , I ca n't wish The Prison Notebooks , the Letters , out of existence . Forgive me , Nino , but I am sending you into that first filthy cell in Regina Coeli Prison , where the single bare bulb burns all night long , and the lice scuttle through the mattress ; and into all the prison cells that followed that one . Let 's suppose that Romain Rolland , who has worked so diligently for your release all these years  --  circulating petitions , writing endless letters , lobbying in the court of world opinion  --  despairs of those tactics : instead , knowing how close you are to death , he organizes a commando raid against the Quisisana Clinic . Chuck Norris is the advance man , he disguises himself as a taciturn ( male ) nurse , we 'll explain away his fair complexion by having him pretend to be German ; at the appointed hour , while a helicopter lowers itself towards the roof , he 'll pick you up in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ) , toss you over his shoulder , and , a machine gun in his free hand , take out a few fascists as he rushes to the roof . Chuck will cradle you in his arms , stroke your black hair away from your hot forehead , say , " Hey , guy , it 's okay . You 're all right , comrade . " There will be no flier headlined " Italian Fascism Has Murdered Gramsci No , comrade , you will live . <p> Neither of you will become famous . Sorry , there 's truth to that old saw about death being good for your career . Rosa ends up giving lectures at the New School , writing for magazines with everdwindling circulations . She began her article " Either/Or " with a quote from Revelations : I would thou wert cold or hot . So then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spew thee out of my mouth . But now the masses have moved to White Plains , they drive DeSotos , she has become an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm dry air of Southern California , regaining some measure of health , joining up with that colony of squabbling , quibbling , squalling leftist exiles . <p> What will I do with them , now that I 've saved them ? Have them meet again , on a subway platform in Brooklyn ; Rosa , 103 , with that papery , almost smooth-as-a-baby 's patch of skin on her cheeks that old , old women get ; and Antonio , in his eighties , lumbering and wheezing up the steps . But then , it could only be the early seventies : too early , still . No , I 'll have time pass , but the two of them stay in their late forties , the ages they were when they died ; it 's 1990 , Rosa is sitting on the bench at Ditmas station in Brooklyn , waiting for the F train , the Americans with Disabilities Act has just passed , she 's reading the article about it in The New York Times . Antonio comes and sits down next to her . He knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of them , but still she sidles a bit away . He ca n't help looking over her shoulder , reading the same article she is . She shakes the newspaper a bit , casts him a quick cold glance . He looks away ; but then she says , " Excuse me . We 've met , have n't we ? " <p> What shall I have the two of them say ? Shall I have Antonio say that our movement must concern itself with more than legislation , must reach for the solution to more complex tasks than those proposed by the present development of the struggle ; namely , for the creation of a new , integral culture ... ; shall I have Rosa come back with the necessity of our movement being democratic , that we must make our own errors , errors ... infinitely more fruitful and more valuable than the infallibility of any CIL board and all its high-powered consultants ? <p> But no , it 's another conversation I ca n't imagine . <p> No , I have to go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened that on the 10th of March , 1912 , at a congress of the Second International , in a corridor of the Hotel Leveque , at precisely 2:53 , that Comrade Luxemburg , heading in a southerly direction down the corridor towards the dining hall while Comrade Gramsci headed towards the north staircase , passed each other , still , had it happened , Rosa would have startled slightly as she glimpsed him , the misshapen dwarf limping towards her in a secondhand black suit so worn the fabric is turning green with age , her eye immediately drawn to this disruption in the visual field . Realizing she was staring , she would have glanced quickly away . And then , the moment after , realizing that the quick aversion of the gaze was as much of an insult as the stare , she would have turned her head back , but tried to make her gaze general . Comrade Rosa would have felt a slight flicker of embarrassment ? shame ? revulsion ? dread ? a feeling that can have no name ? <p> Would Gramsci at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , stared back , deciding that her right to look at him equaled his right to look at her ? Did a slight smile pass across his face because he was glad to know that such a prominent comrade shared his condition ? <p> It is all over in a matter of seconds . <p> But this never happened , and even if it had , it would not have mattered . What passed between the two of you belongs to the realm of thought before speech , of the shape of the future before it can be seen : a nameless discomfort , not yet even a premonition . <p> No , there is no such place on earth . You will not find this Lake Catano on any map : I have created it out of words . This congress never happened ; the two of you were not there . <p> Look down through those clear blue waters of Lake Catano to the shifting shadows of the lake 's ripples that speckle the rocks at the bottom ; see the shadows grow larger and larger until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never existed , disappears . The scullery girl chopping onions in the kitchen automatically wipes her cheeks with the backs of her hands , and discovers that her cheeks are not wet with onion tears ; surprised , she sniffs the air : it does not smell of onions , it does not smell of anything . Upstairs , the chambermaid , old Madame Robert , stands on her aching legs and snaps a freshly laundered sheet through the air . Madame Robert , your legs will ache no more : I am writing away your pain , I am writing away your very existence . For a moment , the motes of dust you have disturbed dance glistening in the air , but then they cease , and first the sheet itself and then you yourself turn to shadows and vanish . <p>
