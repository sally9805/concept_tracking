Christmas seemed to come early in Colombia last week as one of the country 's most wanted drug lords turned himself in at a church 14 miles south of Medellin . Fabio ( " Fabito " ) Ochoa Vasquez , 33 , was the first chieftain of the so-called Medellin cartel to surrender under the terms of a decree announced by President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo last week . Ochoa is wanted in the U.S. for masterminding the 1986 slaying of federal witness Adler ( Barry ) Seal in Baton Rouge , La . He is also linked to drug-trafficking activities with former Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega . <P> The government expects 200 to 300 drug lords to take advantage of Gaviria 's offer before Dec. 25 . U.S. officials were less than jubilant . Under the terms of the decree , drug dealers are immune from extradition to the U.S. and not required to confess all their crimes . Depending on the Colombian courts , Ochoa could wind up serving less than 20 months in jail and possibly even go free .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
