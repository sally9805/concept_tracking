<p> Miguel Angel Caro Quintero , identified by U.S. officials as one of Mexico 's drug smuggling kingpins , arrived in a pickup truck at his modest horse and cattle ranch here and described life in this small desert town 60 miles south of the U.S. border . <p> " I go to the banks , offices , just like any Mexican , " said Caro Quintero , who has four indictments pending against him in the United States on charges involving cocaine , marijuana , money laundering and racketeering . " Every day I pass by roadblocks , police , soldiers , and there are no problems . " <p> " I 'm in the streets all the time . How can they not find me ? " he asked at the end of a rare , hour-long interview . " Because they 're not looking for me . " <p> Caro Quintero , 33 , is identified by U.S. law enforcement officials as the head of the Sonora cartel , which they describe as one of Mexico 's main drug mafias . Although arrested here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any crime , and Mexican authorities have never charged him with any drug violation . <p> U.S. officials see Caro Quintero as a prime example of how weak Mexican laws and an intricate web of corruption have permitted some alleged drug kingpins to operate their syndicates with impunity and live without fear of arrest , conviction or extradition to the United States . At the same time , high-ranking politicians , government officials , judges , prosecutors , and military and police officers have en riched themselves by protecting the syndicates , and they are rarely prosecuted or investigated . <p> After Caro Quintero 's 1992 tax arrest , for instance , the United States and Mexico launched a joint prosecution effort . " But it was thwarted when Miguel used a combination of threats and bribes to have the charges dismissed by a federal judge in Hermosillo capital of his home state , Sonora , and he 's operated freely since that time , " said an official of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) . <p> Similar allegations of high-level corruption are aired almost daily here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its other institutions , including the military . <p> The recent revelations have prompted a more thorough debate among U.S. officials over whether President Clinton should certify by Saturday that Mexico is a reliable ally in the international war on drugs . <p> " I do n't know if ' collapse ' is the correct term " for what 's happening to the justice system , Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar said in a recent interview . " But it 's the gravest crisis Mexico has faced in the modern age . " On Tuesday , Madrazo announced a " top-to-bottom " reform of his office to address the crisis  --  the latest in a number of such reforms announced in recent years . <p> The New York Times reported Sunday that two state governors  --  Manlio Fabio Beltrones Rivera of Sonora and Jorge Carrillo Olea of Morelos  --  have aided Amado Carrillo Fuentes , head of a Juarez-based smuggling cartel . Despite numerous U.S. intelligence reports detailing their drug ties , the Times reported , " both governors seem to enjoy a tacit immunity from concerted criminal investigation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Attorney General Madrazo said neither governor is under investigation for ties to drug smuggling . <p> At the same time , some of Mexico 's top alleged kingpins  --  including Carrillo Fuentes , Caro Quintero and brothers Jesus and Luis Amezcua , who are considered among the world 's biggest traffickers of methamphetamine  --  have no drug charges pending in Mexico . Despite indictments against each of these men in the United States , U.S. officials say they face little threat of being apprehended and extradited for trial in the United States because of tough restrictions against extradition in Mexico 's constitution . <p> Until last year , only two Mexican citizens had been sent to the United States for trial under a 1978 extradition treaty between the two countries . But new laws permit Mexico 's foreign minister to find " an exception " permitting extradition . Last year , four Mexican citizens were sent to the United States , including two accused drug dealers . <p> Juan Garcia Abrego , the head of the Gulf cartel who was recently sentenced to life in prison in a drug trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States because he held dual citizenship . <p> Mexican anti-drug officials said Carrillo Fuentes has weapons and conspiracy charges pending against him . If arrested , they said , he would be held while drug trafficking charges were filed and officials considered a pending U.S. request for extradition . <p> Authorities thought they would nab Carrillo Fuentes at his sister 's wedding in early January , when private planes ferrying guests in and out of local airports led drug investigators to believe that he would make an appearance at the ceremony . But the Juarez cartel chief never showed up , and officials say he may have been tipped off by Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo , the anti-drug czar who was arrested last week after officials charged he had been an informant for Carrillo Fuentes for years . A federal judge indicted Gutierrez yesterday on charges of aiding and protecting cocaine shipments , the Associated Press reported . <p> While drug investigations here have been severely hampered by corruption , U.S. and Mexican officials said , until recently they were also crippled by a legal system that did not permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informants . In November , however , Mexico 's Congress approved an organized crime bill that legalizes such tactics and institutes a witness protection program . <p> " We did n't have any legal way to introduce into evidence taped conversations  --  wiretaps  --  or to protect witnesses who enter into plea bargains in return for evidence that can be used against kingpins , " said Juan Rebolledo Jout , a top Foreign Ministry official . Without such tools , he said , " these people are powerful , they are corrupt , and they are difficult to catch . " <p> However , Mexican officials conceded , a critical problem still remains . Because U.S. cases are often built with confidential informants and wiretaps , it is unclear whether Mexican judges will allow extraditions to move forward if they are based on U.S. cases that used wiretaps and confidential informants before they became legal in Mexico . <p> U.S. officials said they are beginning a major extradition push for Caro Quintero because there are no charges against him in Mexico . Mexican officials said he is under investigation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't have charges against him , " said the Foreign Ministry 's Rebolledo . " We are reviewing how decisions are made and investigations are being carried out . " <p> Caro Quintero denied being involved in any way in drug trafficking . He said he and his family are the victims of a vendetta by U.S. drug agents seeking revenge for the 1985 murder in Guadalajara of DEA agent Enrique Camarena . <p> Miguel 's brother Rafael , co-founder of the infamous Guadalajara drug cartel , was convicted in Camarena 's slaying , which U.S. officials frequently cite as the event that opened their eyes to the growing power and menace of Mexico 's drug mafias . <p> With his brother 's imprisonment , " Miguel Caro Quintero now runs the organization , " DEA chief Thomas Constantine told the Senate two years ago . It is one of " the four major Mexican drug trafficking organizations that work closely with the Cali Colombia mafia " to smuggle cocaine into the United States , Constantine said . <p> Caro Quintero called the charges " fabrications " and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted by the law . He added that he does not believe his brother killed Camarena . <p> Tall , with jet-black hair and a thick mustache , wearing bluejean pants and jacket with a plaid shirt and a white cowboy hat , Caro Quintero looks like he stepped out of a cigarette ad . He said his family  --  he has three brothers and six sisters  --  grew up in the neighboring state of Sinaloa , where his father , who died five years ago , owned a cattle farm . He is married and has two sons , ages 7 and 12 . <p> Caro Quintero said his family came to Sonora about 15 years ago . He denied reports that his family owns hotels , movie theaters and huge amounts of land in and around Caborca , which is about 75 miles southwest of the border city of Nogales , in a remote desert region known as a haven for traffickers and clandestine airstrips . <p> A 1994 indictment in Arizona charged that Caro Quintero negotiated with an undercover DEA agent to set up a series of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Caro Quintero said he and his family own only a ranch where they raise cattle and a farm where they grow honeydews and watermelons for export to the United States . He said the family 's land holdings total about 25 acres . <p> " If I had a cartel , I 'd have a lot of money and my brother would n't be there in jail , " he said .
