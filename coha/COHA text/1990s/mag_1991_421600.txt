ARTIST BARBARA NESSIM COMBINES TRADITIONAL TOOLS SUCH AS PAINTS AND INK WITH COMPUTER SKETCHES TO CREATE POWERFUL NEW IMAGES FOR THE MODERN AGE <p> Barbara Nessim 's studio is the very image of the Manhattan artist 's flat . The area is filled with all the tools of the trade : brushes , sponges , jars of paint and ink , spattered worktables . But what sets her studio apart are the computers , which , with a corner all their own , form the true center of her work space . " I still work with other materials , of course , " says Nessim , a working artist for more than two decades , " but I spend most of my time with the computers . " Programmers have been toying with computer graphics for decades , but it is only relatively recently that nonspecialists have been attracted to computer art . Nessim herself was one of the pioneers , getting involved in the early Eighties , when computer graphics were just gaining limited artistic acceptance in some circles . Many people in the art world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers , but Nessim hopes to introduce them to the possibilities with her " Random Access Memories " exhibition , which opened at New York 's Rempire Fine Art and Gallery on April 11 . " Random Access Memories " consists of four displays : a series of three-dimensional " stereo pair " framed images , four postersize single-image pastels , seven of Nessim 's 6 foot x 9 foot composite flags ( each composed of 72 individual computer drawings ) , and a Macintosh-based interactive experience that yields each visitor a personalized miniature sketchbook . Although at first glance Nessim 's work does not suggest the aid of computers , these displays would have been nearly impossible without them . The 3-D display , for instance , relies on two similar but slightly offset slide photographs-one for the left eye , one for the right-placed in a viewing device . The distinct images are combined in the viewer 's brain to create the illusion of depth . The minute differences between the two slides would have been extremely difficult to manage by hand , but with the computer 's help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interactive exhibit , which Nessim calls " the jewel of the show , " could n't exist apart from the computer . Nessim filled a database with more than 200 drawings , and the gallery visitor uses the computer to select sketches to include in a miniature booklet , which the machine prints on the spot . " Everyone who comes will get a little gift , " Nessim explains , " which not only serves as a souvenir from the show but is also a unique work of art . And they choose it themselves , they participate in it . " Just as some writers are searching for ways to involve the reader more directly in the reading experience , Nessim has found a way to give the audience an active role in her display . The computer offers artists a few clear advantages : minute control of the work , the power to make changes and corrections quickly and easily , and the ability to create multiple identical copies of an item with minimal difficulty . But the computer has yet to produce a revolution in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional means for producing finished work : They use the computer to make rough sketches or , as in Nessim 's case , components for a larger work developed outside the machine . High-quality plotters and printers are still prohibitively expensive , and even the best are limited in the sorts of effects they can create . As long as such limitations exist , artistic applications of computer technology will be circumscribed as well . So for now the computer will remain an exotic design tool for interested artists , rather than an indispensable one for all . But as more galleries open their doors to exhibitions of computer art , some sort of explosion can not be far off . Someday , Nessim predicts , the computer will become " like the telephone . You 're not going to be able to live without one , and you 're not going to want to . " In that computerized world , work like hers will find a natural home . <p> ILLUSTRATION:FROM A DISTANCE , THE COLORS DOMINATE , AND YOU SEE A FLAG . BUT AS YOU NEAR , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE NATION . <p> ILLUSTRATION:LOOKING CAREFULLY , YOU CAN SEE THE MINUTE DIFFERENCES IN EACH PAIR OF DRAWINGS . WHEN YOUR LEFT EYE SEES ONLY THE LEFT IMAGE , YOUR BRAIN MUST COMBINE THE TWO TO RECONCILE THE INPUTS , CREATING THE ILLUSION OF DEPTH . THE COMPUTER MAKES THESE SLIGHT ALTERATIONS SIMPLE FOR THE ARTIST . <p> By ROBERT K.J. KILLHEFFER <p>
