<p> SAN FRANCISCO - Moments after he whiplashed a home run to provide the Rockies with a 4-0 lead over the San Francisco Giants in the fifth inning Friday night , Dante Bichette stood alone in left field , staring , seemingly , into space . <p> Actually , and intently , Bichette was studying the scoreboard . <p> Down the Pacific Coast Highway , the Los Angeles Dodgers also were ahead 4-0 against the San Diego Padres . <p> " This thing , " Bichette said to himself , " is getting fun . " <p> This thing - this pennant race- is getting wild in the West . <p> Exactly , to the day , 87 years before , the New York Giants and the Chicago Cubs were commingled in their own pennant race . The Giants were up on the Cubs by a half-game in the National League , and the two were tied 1-1 in the ninth at the Polo Grounds . With two out , the Giants had two on . Moose McCormick danced off third , and rookie Fred Merkle leaned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-center , and McCormick crossed the plate as thousands of Giants fanatics stormed the field . To avoid the maddening crowd , Merkle , once he saw the ball land safely in the outfield and the run score , turned and scampered toward the clubhouse . <p> The game was over . The Giants had won . <p> Was it ? Did they ? <p> Cubs second baseman Johnny Evers - immortalized in ' Tinkers to Evers to Chance " - retrieved the ball from the outfield , got the umpire 's attention and stepped on second base . <p> MERKLE WAS OUT ON A FORCE PLAY ! <p> The run did n't count , and the game was still tied . Because of the throng on the field , the umpires could n't restore order and resume play . The National League president ruled late that night that the game would be rescheduled at the conclusion of the season . <p> The Cubs won the replayed game , took the pennant and eventually became the World Series champions . They have never won the World Series since . <p> Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not before saying : " I guess they 'll put on my tombstone : ' Here Lies Bonehead Merkle . " ' <p> Nobody in the Rockies clubhouse knows who Fred Merkle was , but the players do know they do n't want to be a bonehead . <p> " In a pennant race , everything is magnified , " says Rockies shortstop Walt Weiss , who was in a few pennant races with the Oakland A 's as a youngster . " And you ca n't afford to mess up . Every at-bat , every ground ball is important . " <p> A few minutes earlier , Weiss had snared a screaming ball to short to end the ninth and give the Rockies a victory against San Diego in the opening game of the most critical road trip in the short history of the Denver ball team . <p> But there was no celebration in the clubhouse . The Rockies took showers , ate spaghetti and listened to music on the stereo . They are relaxed , almost too relaxed . <p> In San Francisco four days later , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a gray three-piece suit , carrying a briefcase , but he was soon standing in front of his cubicle in his uniform , tapping at his glove . He had made the transition from civilian to player . <p> Larry Walker was drinking chocolate milk and eating a doughnut and several Rockies were playing a card game . <p> Bichette was shaving for the first time in several days . <p> " Do you shave after you get three hits ? " I asked . <p> " No , I shave when I get ugly . " <p> " Then you must have to shave three or four times a day , " I said - jokingly . <p> Bichette did n't grab a bat . He said , " There have been a lot of distractions for me this year off the field , but on the field , the past few weeks have been the greatest of my life . This is what you play for - a pennant race that is going down to the wire . " <p> Baseball , it has been said for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marathon . <p> Now , however , comes the finishing kick . The line is just ahead . The Rockies can see it ; they can almost touch it . They conclude a four-game series today in San Francisco , then take on the Dodgers in three games in Los Angeles and return home for the FINAL FOUR against the Giants . <p> There is no visible tension or anxiety in the clubhouse . This could be a game in May in Pittsburgh , not a late September confrontation in San Francisco . <p> " You really ca n't tell any difference in the team , " says pitching coach Larry Bearnarth , " until just about 10 minutes before the game when we 're all in the dugout . Then you can see it in their faces . They understand what this is all about . They can do what no other expansion team has done this fast . So they start pumping each other up . There 's a lot of rah-rah . It 's almost like a college team . " <p> Pitcher Curtis Leskanic , who shaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is standing on the dugout steps singing at the top of his lungs : " Are you ready for some football Monday Night Football . " <p> But this is Saturday Afternoon Baseball . <p> Leskanic and fellow pitcher Kevin Ritz had to pay off a bet in San Diego the other day to Bryan Rekar and Joe Grahe . They had wagered on the Miami Dolphins-Pittsburgh Steelers game . Rekar and Grahe took the Dolphins . So , did Leskanic and Ritz lose thousands of dollars ? No . The native Pennsylvanians were forced to parade around in Dolphins T-shirts . <p> Does this sound like a team unable to handle the pressure ? <p> " I do n't sense that the guys are not being able to deal with what 's going on , " manager Don Baylor says . " They 're enjoying this . I 'll tell you who 's not having fun - those clubs like the Minnesota Twins that have been eliminated for months . The players there are tense because they want the season to be over , and they may not be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head Todd and the Monsters " T-shirt . Who did he lose a bet to ? Rekar , looking younger than 23 and wearing glasses , is reading " Baseball America " and telling everybody that he hit a ball over the fence in batting practice . Rekar had not gotten a hit in a game since being called up to the Rockies - until the fourth inning yesterday . <p> First base coach Gene Glynn is eating an ice cream drumstick , and pitcher Billy Swift has on his Walkman headphones . He 's probably not listening to a major-league baseball game . Outfielder Mike Kingery is sitting in front of his stall reading the Bible , and most of the other players are watching " ESPN SportsCenter . " <p> Someone has forgotten to tell these guys they are supposed to be uptight . <p> " It 's a good bunch , " general manager Bob Gebhard says . " Nobody is causing any trouble , and they 're doing and saying the right things and going about their business in the right way . " <p> Unlike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco Giants . Giants pitcher Mark Leiter , who will start against the Rockies today , was quoted in Los Angeles several days ago as saying : " I do n't have anything against the Dodgers . I 'd rather see those guys win it than Colorado . Those guys ( the Rockies ) are so cocky and arrogant ; they think they invented the game . I get to pitch against them twice ( here and in Denver in the last series ) . I 'd love to knock them off . " <p> Leiter since has claimed he was misquoted . ( Sure . ) But he was overheard saying to pitching coach Dick Poole , " I think I stirred up some  --  . " <p> He certainly did stir up some  --  . <p> As has Los Angeles manager Tommy Lasorda , who wondered aloud during his club 's series with the Padres if Giants manager Dusty Baker might not try as hard against the Rockies because of his close friendship with Baylor . Both Baylor and Baker were outraged . The Rockies held a closed-door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , but to determine playoff shares . <p> " Is n't it a little early to be doing that ? " I asked player representative Joe Girardi , who was standing outside the batting cage . <p> " That 's when we were told we had to do it . It 's not a big deal . " <p> There 's as much conversation and controversy about the MVP race as the pennant race on the West Coast . Who is more valuable - Bichette or L.A. 's Mike Piazza ? In the first five games of this trip Bichette was 13 of 24 with three doubles , a home run and seven RBIs . Who says he ca n't hit away from Coors Field ? <p> " I 'm tired of all the talk , " says Bichette . " I 'm just thinking about winning . It 's day-to-day , and you ca n't get ahead of yourself worrying about the games with the Dodgers . " <p> But that does n't keep Bichette from staring at the scoreboard . <p> Yesterday afternoon , however , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodgers were playing a night game . <p> And the Rockies were losing 2-0 . Six games into the last regular-season trip of the season , the Rockies are 3-3 . They need at least two victories in the next four to avoid , probably , slipping behind the Dodgers . " I do n't think the guys were feeling more pressure today , " Baylor said after the defeat . " I just think they were n't hitting the ball . We ca n't get this one back . We 've got to start thinking about tomorrow , then the next . " <p> The clubhouse was as quiet as a college library on Saturday night . <p> When everyone else was gone , Rockies equipment manager Dan " Chico " McGinn scurried about , though , to prepare the clubhouse for another game . " I was with the Minnesota Twins when they won a pennant race in 1987 , and this team reminds me a lot of them . Nobody expected us to win then , and nobody believed we could do it this year . The guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to do . " <p> Eight games remain ; the Rockies are in first , and they 're thinking about a Miracle Finish , not a Merkle Finish . <p> The game is on . There is a pennant race .
