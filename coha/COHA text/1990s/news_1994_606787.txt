<p> It 's the height of holiday madness and you 're heading out of town for a much-needed break . Fighting the traffic , you reach the airport just in time  --  only to find that the airline has oversold your flight . You end up getting bumped from the plane and left behind to wait for a later flight  --  maybe a much later one . <p> This may sound like bad news in the midst of the year-end festivities , but to some passengers it 's actually good news . Some people are eager to be bumped so they can collect denied-boarding compensation in the form of cash , free airline tickets or cash vouchers that can be used to buy tickets . On some flights these days , passengers actually compete to give up their seats for freebies . <p> For these eager beavers , the holiday travel season is prime time because so many people are flying , according to Tom Parsons , editor of Best Fares Discount Travel magazine . A monthly , it tracks air-fare , lodging and car rental bargains around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will continue to oversell , many of their flights for the upcoming travel holidays , " Parsons predicts . He has compiled a list of steps that could boost your chances of getting bumped profitably . If you do give up your seat , of course , you can expect to arrive at your destination at least an hour or two late  --  and maybe more . On the other hand , you also could be carrying extra cash to pay the holiday bills or a ticket for a trip in the months ahead . <p> But for other travelers , getting bumped may be a hassle they hope to avoid , especially if they are on a tight schedule . Overbooking is not illegal , and most airlines overbook their scheduled flights , says the Department of Transportation . The agency has just issued a revised edition  --  the first update in nine years  --  of " Fly-Rights , " its consumer guide to air travel . The guide explains how best to avoid getting bumped and details your rights if you are denied boarding . <p> Airlines overbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-shows , " says DOT , and the carriers do n't want to fly with empty seats that could be sold profitably . <p> In the three-month period from April through June , the nine major U.S. airlines bumped more than 178,000 passengers from oversold flights , according to DOT 's latest statistics . All but about 12,500 of them agreed to be bumped in exchange for compensation . The rest lost their seats involuntarily . They also were entitled to compensation , provided they had complied with airline check-in policies and other restrictions . <p> Passenger Rights <p> Whenever a flight has been oversold , federal rules require that the airlines first ask for volunteers to give up their seats before anyone is bumped involuntarily . On most flights , a few passengers usually have the flexibility in their schedules and are willing  --  for a price  --  to catch a later flight . DOT does not specify how much volunteers should be paid for being bumped , leaving it up to the carrier and the passenger to negotiate mutually acceptable compensation . <p> In practice , a gate agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no takers , the offer may be raised until someone accepts . Compensation can be cash , free tickets or other benefits . <p> But there are hazards in voluntary bumping , as " Fly-Rights " points out . Make sure the airline can confirm a seat on a later flight , the guide advises . If you are put on standby for another flight that is full , " you could be stranded . " If you face a long wait , ask if the airline will pay for your meals , a phone call or a hotel room . If not , these expenses could end up costing you more than you got for volunteering . If you are offered a free ticket , determine if any restrictions apply . For example , black-out dates may prevent you from using the ticket when you want to . Find out how soon the ticket expires and whether it is good for international flights . <p> If an airline ca n't recruit volunteers , as sometimes happens , it may have to bump someone involuntarily . In this situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the airline can get you to your destination within one hour of your original scheduled arrival time , you get nothing extra . <p> If it gets you to your destination between one and two hours after your scheduled arrival time ( or between one and four hours on international flights ) , the airline must pay you the equivalent of the one-way fare to your final destination . However , the maximum pay-out is $ 200 . <p> If you are delayed in arriving for more than two hours ( or four hours on international flights ) , you get twice your one-way fare , or a maximum of $ 400 . <p> To qualify for denied-boarding compensation , you must adhere to the carrier 's check-in policies . Most airlines require that you check in at least 10 minutes before flight time on domestic flights . Check-in for international flights can be as much as three hours in advance , says " Fly-Rights , " because of security procedures . <p> There is no compensation for passengers who are bumped because the airline has substituted a smaller plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to flights on planes with 60 or fewer seats or to international flights bound for the United States . <p> The best way to avoid getting bumped , says " Fly-Rights , " is to show up early at the airport . " On oversold flights , the last passengers to check in are usually the first to be bumped , even if they have met the check-in deadline . " The guide suggests allowing extra time in getting to the airport in case the access road is backed up or the parking lot is full  --  both strong possibilities during the holiday crush . <p> Volunteering <p> To boost your chances at getting bumped  --  if this is what you want  --  consider these steps : <p> Before leaving home , check with the carrier you will be flying to find out if your flight is full or near full . If it is expected to be half empty , there is little likelihood you will be bumped , and the steps that follow are not worth your while . But remember , stormy winter weather can play havoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill with stragglers connecting from delayed flights . <p> Be sure to carry reading or work material : You may have to amuse yourself for hours at the airport . <p> Inform family and friends at your destination of your plans , so they are aware you may be delayed . <p> Plan to arrive at the airport at least 90 minutes to two hours before flight time , advises Parsons . You want to be first in line at the departure gate when it opens for check-in so you can be the first to volunteer . <p> If the plane is oversold , bargain for a round-trip ticket , says Parsons . It may be more valuable than the $ 200 or $ 400 maximum the carrier is willing to offer . Be sure the airline confirms a seat for you on one of its later flights or on a flight on a competing carrier . A pocket flight schedule , if you are carrying one , can help you determine what your departure options are . <p> If you are delayed by more than two hours , says Parsons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep family and friends up to date . If you are hungry , ask for a voucher for a free meal . The airline is not obligated to provide either , but it does n't hurt to try . <p> As a final note , Parsons suggests that if you get bumped once during the busy holiday season , it might happen again . If the new flight on which you are booked with a confirmed seat is also oversold , he says , volunteer again to be bumped from it . " You may end up with another free ticket .
