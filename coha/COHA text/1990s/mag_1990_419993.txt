Parents loathe it , doctors exonerate it , kids love it  --  and leave it around  --  but pink and profitable , the stuff lives on <p> He had it ! Surely he did ! The stuff was expanding like a balloon . Then wetly exploded . THWACK ! <p> History has n't honored the anonymous genius who invented the knot or nail or even such relatively modern miracles of mechanics as the screw or button . But the name of the creator of the first successful bubble gum , the " blow gum " of the South , that ubiquitous pink stuff we all blew bubbles with or stepped or sat in not long ago , would now be stuck for posterity in the annals of time . <p> Not that great prime makers had n't tried before . Ever since chicle immigrated to this country in the mid-19th century  --  according to legend , Mexican general Santa Anna of Alamo infamy introduced it  --  grown men and women had been trying to devise an elastic gum that would pump up into bubbles a hundred times bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1918 E. Gordon Goudey , a direct descendant of Plymouth Colony governor William Bradford , one of the Mayflower party , manufactured O Boy Gum , which one of his descendants claims was the first bubble gum . There is apparently no proof , however , that O Boy resembled today 's products and it definitely was n't the first bubble gum , anyway . The first of the species appeared in 1906 , when one Frank Henry Fleer , founder of the Frank H. Fleer Corporation , developed a synthetic gum with the wonderful name BlibberBlubber , a trademark that , inexplicably , has n't been used since . Fleer , an essential figure in gum history who would also concoct candy-coated Chiclets , worked long and hard on his pet project . It had bubbleability enough but , alas , was far too sticky and brittle . Reluctantly , Fleer had to abandon Blibber-Blubber to what might be called Bubblegumdom 's Gallery of Great Globule Glitches . <p> Yet Fleer bubbleologists kept right on searching . Years passed , the company changed hands , taken over by Fleer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , here it was an early-August morning in 1928 , and a young cost accountant named Walter Diemer did the trick . The age of bubble gum rose like a shimmering pink sun on the horizon . <p> Inspired by his employer 's search for a large , dry bubble that would n't explode and stick so fast to young faces that parents would forbid it in the house , the 23-year-old Diemer was experimenting with a new batch of bubble gum mix . He had no knowledge of chemistry ; for more than a year he 'd been working by simple trial and error . He crammed a generous chunk of the mix in his mouth and blew a bubble . The bubble rose , rose higher . It was a big beautiful bubble , a Brobdingnagian bubble , a **34;0;TOOLONG bubble . Diemer had never before seen one anything like it . And then it popped . Softly it popped . It popped and plopped ... and then ... damned if it did n't peel right off his rather prominent nose . <p> " I had it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retirement village , recalls the breakthrough today , his eyes still snapping and bubbling behind his spectacles . " Everybody tried some . It really went to our heads . We were blowing bubbles and dancing all over the office ! " <p> It was the year before the Great Stock Market Crash  --  but the bursting of the Diemer bubble was arguably far more momentous , or at least more momentously joyous , than the popping of the Wall Street bubble . Then , in the best tradition of Bells and Edisons everywhere , suddenly there was another obstacle to surmount . The next morning Diemer 's five-pound batch of the new gum just did n't work : " Would n't blow a bubble worth a darn . " Probably had something to do with the room temperature , he says . <p> Bubble , bubble , toil and trouble . Four more months of work . Sometime around Christmas that year , Diemer made an immense 300-pound batch of bubbly that did n't fizzle out in the vats overnight . " I was young , very self-conscious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing around looking very skeptical . They just stared disapprovingly and I was certain they were all thinking , ' That crazy kid . That stuff he made is going to break the blades in our mixing machines . ' Well , the machines started groaning , and the mix started popping and then ... I realized I 'd forgotten to put any coloring in the gum . " <p> Diemer remedied his mistake the very next day , when he made a second superbatch . " Pink food coloring was the only one I had at hand , " he says . " And that 's the reason ever since , all over the world , that bubble gum has been predominantly pink . " <p> The Dom Perignon of bubble gum has always steadfastly refused to reveal his original formula , except to say that he used " the standard ingredients " already employed in those days . It was rather a unique combination of the same materials . Bubble gum is different from its older sibling mainly in the elasticity and firmness of its base , which produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinner and thinner , to create bigger , better bubbles . It becomes soft at mouth temperature <p> A harmless rubberlike tree latex  --  similar to the one used in those days for making girdles  --  was what gave the first bubble gum its elasticity , though today synthetics like vinyl resins and microcrystalline waxes are used . The new synthetics can best be described as " thermoplastics , " Diemer says , because " they become soft at mouth temperature , " and they " definitely are n't like rubber tires . " In any event , the prime maker did n't even patent his invention . Gum manufacturers are a competitive and litigious lot , and he feared that since patents can be a license to steal " he might be " exposing trade secrets to others . " <p> The day after Christmas 1928 the first Dubble Bubble , as Diemer 's boss dubbed his invention , was testmarketed in Philadelphia , in a mom-and-pop candy store at 26 Schenectady Street . The location remains unmarked by any commemorative plaque or pink globe , but Dubble Bubble was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months imitations were on the market . Dubble Bubble , however , far outstripped all upstart competitors . It also quickly surpassed Tootsie Rolls to become the world 's biggest-selling 1-cent confection and an American institution , as well as a synonym for bubble gum itself . <p> Bubble gum sales in the United States alone last year reached an estimated $150 million . But Diemer is n't bitter about not receiving royalties on a patent that would have made him a billionaire . " After all , " he says , " I was a Fleer employee . " His discovery did move him up the corporate ladder to senior vice president , and he remained a member of Fleer 's board of directors for 15 years after his retirement to Ocean City , New Jersey , in 1970 . A few years ago , after a series of crippling strokes , he learned to walk again at a local rehabilitation center . In a spirit appropriate to the cheerful inventor of bubble gum , he says , " Why , the 75-year-olds there had more problems than me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Diemer has no qualms about bubble gum . He hardly gives a thought to the legions of outraged parents , teachers , dentists , philosophers , fundamentalist preachers and , of course , janitors who for years have condemned him without even knowing his name . He much prefers to take pride in the scores of congratulatory letters and calls he has received from all over the world . " I have no regrets , " he says . " Bubble gum brought a little happiness to millions of kids , and if I could do that I 'm happy . " <p> Soon more than 20 other companies were competing for a share of an apparently inexhaustible  --  and ultimately international  --  market that eventually included many adult " connoisseurs " who say they find bubble gum a better chew than regular brands . For years Dubble Bubble 's chief competitor was the Bowman Company , purchased in 1955 by the Topps Company , which first made ordinary By Gum gum but soon came up with their famous Blony , guaranteed to produce bubbles " twice as large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of gum available for a penny . " <p> Bowman was among the first companies to insert picture cards in their bubble gum packages . At the outset these cards depicted the traditional cowboys and Indians  --  until J. Warren Bowman , the company founder , included pictures of war heroes . Today a full set of his 240-card war series is a collector 's item , worth well over $1,000 . But at the time , the cards created an international incident : some of them centered on the Japanese invasion of China in the 1930s , and after 100 million had been issued , the Japanese Embassy in Washington protested that " peace-loving Japan " was being done an injustice . The State Department coldly replied that there was nothing unjust about depicting incidents like the Japanese sinking of a United States gunboat , the Panay , in the Yangtze ( now Chang Jiang ) River in 1937 . <p> The resulting furor only gave Bowman welcome publicity . Bowman was the first man to build bubble gum plants in Japan . Parents and teachers reasoned that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he might even have given them a motive for Pearl Harbor . Japanese youngsters were soon driving their elders to near seppuku as a result . In 1937 Bowman was denounced as an " enemy of Japan " and banned from the empire . Most Japanese obviously agreed with the anonymous old American rhyme : TABLE <p> Even before the war American children were spending close to $4.5 million a year on Walter Diemer 's invention . During World War II the bubble burst when a shortage of essential Siamese jelutong forced bubble gum makers to halt domestic production . G.I. 's , however , blew bubbles all over the globe  --  in Europe , Africa , Asia , Borneo , even on Pitcairn Island , where descendants of mutineers on the Bounty ( SMITHSONIAN , February 1988 ) took eagerly to bubbling . Servicemen introduced Dubble Bubble to the Eskimos and it was reported that they preferred it to their previous favorite chew  --  whale blubber . <p> There were the usual promotional stories , the truth hard to separate from P.R . In Africa , it was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieu of sheep and oxen as payment for a wife . Headhunters in Borneo kidnapped a diplomat and held him for a ransom of Dubble Bubble . On the home front the Brooklyn-based Topps Company entered the gum field in 1938 , and later became famous by offering bubble gum baseball cards and by introducing Bazooka brand bubble-gum-blowing contests among ballplayers . " Do n't talk , chum ; chew Topps gum " was their version of the wartime admonition " Loose lips sink ships . " <p> Robert Benchley approved of gum chewing in an essay called " America 's Greatest Movement  --  The Jaw Movement . " But " bubble gum " was soon a slur among intellectuals . Phrases like " the bubble gum of literature " popped up . Ezra Pound referred to a noted literary award as " the bubble gum prize . " Writers tended to side with Elbert Hubbard , who had written : " We will never be a great country until we expend more money for books than we do for gum . " <p> The postwar years brought a bubble gum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one gum maker claimed , the return of bubble gum was second in importance only to the return of their fathers and brothers . Almost as soon as they could buy " pink gold " again , students in Longview , Texas , conducted a contest and crowned local chewers for bubbles that had the loudest pop , were the messiest , biggest , smallest , " cutest , " " most geometric " and " most glamorous . " Bubble gum manufacturers at first could not meet the demand . A " pink market " emerged , mainly operated by kids ( so far as is known the Mafia did n't get into this act ) . Manufacturers supplied at regular prices what penny gum they had coined , and young retailers sold it at whatever the traffic would bear . " I remember four people best from World War II , " Robert McShane , now himself a high-powered office equipment salesman , recalls . " Hitler , Mussolini , Tojo and Cynthia Bolo . When I lived out in Far Rockaway , Cynthia used to sell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were times when penny pieces of Dubble Bubble did indeed go for one dollar each . Those lucky enough to get it kept it " alive " at night in a glass of water and chewed it for as long as a month . <p> Parents of bubble gum addicts firmly believed its popularity with children was based largely on its capacity for driving parents crazy . To a person , they loathed the pernicious stuff , whether chewed or sat on , and dreaded washing it off clothing , peeling it off faces and cutting it out of hair . " This bubble , " one father held in a letter to a newspaper , " may grow larger than  --  and just as empty as  --  junior 's little head , before it bursts with a loud , ghastly , vulgar , thwacking sound . " <p> From that day to this , adult protest has done little to hold back the bubble gum tide . Nothing so reactionary as a parent or teacher was going to stop it . Today bubble gum ( now inflated to 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still smuggled into houses and schoolrooms . Bubbles the size of gallbladders are blown to tatters whenever the teacher 's back is turned . If there 's danger of confiscation , a mouthful can be molded around a pencil eraser or filed for future use on the underside of a desk . <p> Many have tried , yet no one has been able to make a hard case against bubble gum as harmful to youngsters on other than esthetic grounds . In June 1947 , grownups thought their time had come , when a puzzling epidemic of sore throats , vomiting and headaches spread among youngsters throughout America . Parents quickly blamed it all on villainous bubble gum . The U.S. Food &; Drug Administration collected 4,000 samples and subjected them to scientific tests unlike any ever performed before . Seventy-five human guinea pigs , including 25 children , chomped and blew bubbles for periods of up to eight hours , the test wads composed of anywhere from one to six pieces . In the laboratory , investigators analyzed the gum ingredients , implanted gum in the skins of guinea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fed the stuff to monkeys , cats , dogs and even chickens . No toxic ingredients were found , and the FDA dismissed the complaints . Except for aching jaws , there were no bad reactions to the tests . <p> Of course , bubble gum has claimed some victims and fostered some gruesome stories . Kids certainly chew too much bubble gum at a time  --  and have been known to dislocate their jaws this way . In 1944 , a piece of it exploded in a Philadelphia man 's mouth causing him to lose several teeth ; no one could establish just how . One of the more horrendous bubble gum rumors tells of a grandmother who choked on a huge wad after watching her grandson hit a Little League home run . Still , these accounts are mild compared with The Great Gum Murder case . On that occasion , some fiend tried to kill a Sacramento family of four by slipping them all poisoned gum . ( What zany mystery novelist would dare use the scheme as a plot ! ) <p> The pink stuff has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lives , though entire cities have campaigned against it . In 1983 Singapore proposed a ban on bubble gum in all housing projects , claiming that it cost the city $7,500 a year to clean up discarded wads . On the other hand , dentists and speech therapists sometimes recommend chewing bubble gum to strengthen weak jaws . A Columbia University test once found that the chewing of any gum reduces muscular tension and makes people feel more relaxed . Years ago , too , it was reported that a restaurant at the House of Representatives kept a hidden supply of bubble gum for at least three nervous Congressmen who were surreptitious gum chewers . Then there was the authority on organically grown foods who claimed that liquefied bubble gum makes a useful insecticide , far safer than DDT . Bugs nibble on it , she insisted , and their jaws stick together so they can nibble no more . <p> Dentists and dental researchers deny Diemer 's claim that bubble gum helps teeth . But even they will admit that the stuff is not , as used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inner tubes  --  or used gum scraped off the street . Furthermore , it will not cause buck teeth , snap and pop in the stomach , give you appendicitis , clog up the intestines , stunt your growth or seal the lips so that youngsters ca n't breathe , as hysterical parents have claimed over the years . All you can do with ordinary gum is chew it , snap it , stretch it , sculpture it , fish coins out from below gratings with it , and leave it under tables or on the arms of theater seats . Bubble gum opens vast new vistas for the younger set . It means a lot to them . Once I found my children fighting with the dog for a wad . ( Writers ca n't even keep the whole family in bubble gum . ) A bubble in a bubble in a bubble <p> You 've probably seen photographs of animals , especially horses , blowing huge bubbles , but these are always pink balloons supplied by P.R . people . As to bipedal bubble blowers , many contests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that several years back one megabubble dwarfed the blower 's upper body , but that is hearsay . lt is also said that someone at the Philadelphia Chewing Gum Company once blew a jumbo triple bubble ( a bubble in a bubble in a bubble ) . To date , the official record is held by Susan Montgomery Williams of Fresno , who in 1985 blew one 22 inches in diameter as measured by a " gumputer . " <p> Among the hundreds of bubble gum flavors today are foreign favorites like Ginseng Love Bubble Gum ( Korea ) , Brooklyn Bridge Gum ( Italy ) , Pingi Pongi ( Brazil ) and Hollywood Gum ( France ) . Domestic brands include Hubba Bubba ( " the only bubble gum that wo n't stick to your clothes " ) , Bubble Fudge , Bubble Burger , Tubble Gum ( comes in a toothpaste tube ) , Popeye Shredded Bubble Gum ( " looks like spinach ... tastes like bubble gum " ) , a green paste called Ghost Busters Slimer Bubble Gum and even Bubble Tape , a full six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Wm . Wrigley Company , with nearly 50 percent of the total domestic chewing gum market , puts out Big League Chew , a pouch filled with bubble gum meant to resemble chewing tobacco . A legion of little kids has been recruited by Amurol , a Wrigley division , to make daily tests of new products . Far behind Wrigley , but an industry leader , is the Lifesavers Company , whose " soft and juicy " Bubble Yum managed in 1977 to survive  --  with the help of 30 full-page newspaper ads  --  a lurid rumor that their gum contained spider eggs . <p> Recently one of President Bush 's grandsons advised him that he wanted to be a ballplayer , not a politician  --  because " politicians do n't get their pictures on bubble gum baseball cards . " The enterprising Topps Company in Brooklyn , still the world 's leading baseball card gum company , quickly set things right . Obtaining a photograph of George Bush as captain of the 1948 Yale team that played in the College World Series , Topps ran off 100 baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day these may be as valuable as the Topps 1952 Mickey Mantle card , worth $8,000 today . The original oil painting used to make Mantle 's card sold in 1989 for $121,000 . <p> Topps , a virtuoso at P.R. , boasts of making the world 's largest piece of bubble gum , a hunk of its Bazooka brand about the size of 10,000 normal pieces . In 1974 it was presented to baseball ( and bubble gum ) great Willie Mays . There was n't space for it in his trophy room , so he asked that it be divvied up into individual pieces and given to youngsters in hospitals . <p> The economic prosperity that has lined children 's pockets has made bubble gum a major industry . In a country that still spends more on gum than on elementary school textbooks , bubble gum tycoons are blowing bubbles all the way to the bank . Fleer alone makes more than four million pieces of Dubble Bubble a day , gum that is exported to some 50 countries , including several behind the no-longer-Iron Curtain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , white and blue to orange , yellow and ecru  --  though pink is still America 's favorite . Many brands come with comics and fortunes , printed in a dozen languages . Cards still feature football and baseball players , other sports heroes , Presidents and movie stars . Of course dieters chomp only sugarless bubble gum  --  sweetened with sorbitol or similar chemicals . <p> Even once-stodgy Japan has changed its mind about bubble gum , and gum in general , which they call gamu . The Japanese , who now manufacture at least 150 gum flavors , including pickled plum , probably best established the greatness of gamu in 1962 , when the Let 's Chew More Gum Association opened offices in Tokyo . The gala opening , attended by show people , politicians , baseball stars and sumo wrestlers , amounted to a kind of religious ceremony during which a special prayer to gamu was intoned by a Shinto priest standing before an elaborate altar : <p> O Great Spirit of the Chewing Gum , gum of diverse kinds , we offer this prayer to thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our marvelous pet , an important accessory of mankind in this modern age . Chewing gum sweetens the breath , imparts a pleasant feeling , strengthens the stomach and calms anger .... It invites happiness . It attracts smiles . An enjoyable and intellectual life is made possible because of gum chewing .... 0 Great Spirit of the Chewing Gum , rest in peace .... <p> Roughly speaking , the bubble gum that Americans have chomped on over the years would make a stick nearly 113 million miles long , without even stretching it or blowing a bubble ; long enough , that is , to reach more than 200 times to the moon and back . Another figure some mad mathematician concocted years ago holds that the energy Americans expend every day when chewing bubble gum would light a city of ten million people . <p> And so we chew on , borne ceaselessly into the future , chomping and thwacking , thwacking and chomping , billions of us here on Earth and in outer space . The astronauts busily snapped bubbles ( from sugar-free gum ) while in orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly ball in the outfield . Jeremy Boob , PhD , fixed the propeller on the Beatles ' Yellow Submarine with bubble gum , helping the lads escape His Meaniness and the Meanies . Anyway , people can now be incontrovertibly classified as a bubble-gum-chewing species  --  Homo chompit sapiens , Linnaeus might have said . <p> So there really ought to be a monument to Walter Diemer in Philadelphia , somewhere near the busts of the Founding Fathers  --  or at least next to that controversial statue of Rocky  --  a bust of the inventor of bubble gum , chewing , chomping , blowing and bursting that first momentous pink bubble . <p> By Robert Hendrickson <p> <p> This article is adapted from " The Great American Chewing Gum Book " by the author . He is working on a collection of short stories entitled " After the Wars . " <p>
