<p> There 's a universe that exists some 400 years in the future that is radically different from our own . It 's filled with fleets of mighty starships warping across the galaxy ; with strange planets , inhabited by even stranger alien cultures . Different as it is , the architecture of this future universe is recognized in this time by millions of devoted fans across the planet . It 's a future that I , along with dozens of other skilled artists and craftspeople , have been privileged to help create . Star Trek 's vision of the future is like no other . As production designer of a number of Star Trek television series and feature films , including Star Trek : Generations , I 've been lucky enough to help create that vision . It all begins with a simple notation in a script , such as : <p> INT . ENTERPRISE NCC 1701-D  --  STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY Picard and Data step into STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY ; all about them are maps of starfields . <p> From cryptic lines like these , the production designer must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for the look of everything you see on the screen except the actor . The production designer may or may not be involved in the design of wardrobe , although the wardrobe and production designers work very closely with each other , particularly regarding textures and colors . Everything else that you see  --  everything the actor handles , stands in front of , or interacts with  --  is the production designer 's domain . <p> The production designer is usually one of the first people hired by a production company and one of the first to get a chance to look at the script . Keeping in mind the writer 's words and the director 's point of view , the production designer 's vision has to lead him or her to come up with " the thing " in feet and inches , using wood . metal , plaster , paint , and electrical and mechanical effects . <p> For inspiration in designing something that 's supposed to exist 400 years in the future , I often begin by taking familiar images and using them in a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to look different , creatively expressing an unfamiliar lifestyle or a different milieu from that which we are used to . I learned a great lesson from Nick Meyer , who directed and co-wrote Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country . He pointed out that four centuries from now , humans will still have finite dimensions and the same basic needs for life support . Many things , such as basic furniture design , are n't going to change . If your task is to imagine what 's going to happen ! in the next 400 years , you should start with what is likely to remain the same . <p> Making the transition from the Star Trek : The Next Generation television series to the Star Trek : Generations feature film was an interesting challenge . I had to consider the translation of something from a 19-inch diagonal video screen ( the size of the average TV set ) to the feature film screen , which can run 30 feet high and 70 feet wide . What you see on the small video screen is much less detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a designer working on a feature , one has to pay much more attention to those details , especially textures and surfaces that show depth which you might see in a close-up . The fit and finish has to be better , and the choice of color has to display less contrast and more subtlety . With the extra detail evident on the movie screen , it takes more effort to make the fantasy environment appear to be believably real . <p> The Enterprise sets in Generations have been refurbished , raising the level of detail significantly . Along with a team of talented professionals , I created the original sets for The Next Generation 's inaugural season . I went on to supervise the second year , before leaving the sets in the capable hands of designer Richard James . Because I had designed the show to begin with , I felt some obligation to the audience to improve on the seven-year-old sets , hoping that when the fans see them on the big screen ( especially the main bridge ) they 'll say , " So that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more computer stations right and left of the wishbone railing , the bridge 's central element . I raised the captain 's and mates ' seats so that the actors would have a more commanding presence , and repainted the bridge in m , ore subtle colors . I also re-worked the ceiling , building up all the struts . I was always unhappy about the look of the original ceiling , but when the series began we did n't have the money to make it substantial looking . <p> One of the most interesting design challenges in the feature film Generations was an entirely new set for the Enterprise : Stellar Cartography . This is the most important set in the movie . Here , Picard and Data have a conversation about a space phenomenon that 's a pivotal element in understanding the rest of the story . If what happens in that set is not crystal clear , the audience may be confused about where the plot is going . While it only hosts a small , two-character scene no more than three minutes in length , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was called for in the script , in which Stellar Cartography is characterized as a small room with some maps on one wall . It seemed rather uninteresting to me that it be such a small room , considering its importance to the plot . So I conceived a three-story set where the actors enter in the middle of the second story ; the stories below and above contain graphic screens . The entire set encircles the actors with 300 degrees of a giant star map . so that it appears as though they are actually inside an enormous starfield graphic . It 's a representation of one of the quadrants in space , and as the scene progresses , the images on it continually change . <p> The idea for Stellar Cartography was an extension of a crisis management center I designed last year for a company called SAIC , a civilian science and technology group working with the Department of Defense . Their command center had one enormous screen as its central element , and several small screens in a low-ceilinged , semicircular room . I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension of the first complex , and one of the ideas kicked around was that it might be a two-story affair with the entrance to the room on the second story . I thought it was a good idea , and decided to try it out in Stellar Cartography and see if it worked . <p> Of course , every good idea has a catch . This circular , three-story set had to be photographed using a camera mounted on a 40-foot arm , which was poked into the room at odd angles . The director , David Carson , conceived a scene that kept the actors static while the camera moved around them in the center of this vast round room filled with moving images . The visual impact of the setting underlines the importance of the scene . John Alonzo , our Academy Award-winning director of photography , said that we may have made cinematic history with this set . <p> Keep in mind that every line of every design has to be of a practical as well as aesthetic nature . You have to know that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph the design . With experience , you realize that it does n't really matter how beautiful your drawings are , because they 're going to be put in a drawer when the show is over . And it does n't really matter how sturdy and beautifully constructed the set is , because it 's where the camera will be placed to best see the action and how the director of photography lights the set that really either puts it on the screen or makes it all an exercise in futility . From the very beginning , production designers have to think about where the camera is going to be and what they will want that camera to see . <p> This brings to mind another design challenge I faced when doing work on Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country : the Klingon courtroom . This was a set that I thought came off on-screen as fairly spectacular  --  but not nearly as spectacular as the planning that went into it had to be . <p> There was a very practical problem to solve with the Klingon courtroom . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for something like 3,500 shouting Klingons raising all kinds of hell . We should have had balcony after balcony of Klingons with their legs hung over the railings , acting like a barely controllable rabble . The higher they got in the balconies , the more riotous they would become . We were limited by our budget for costumes and makeup and by the simple fact that it takes three hours in a makeup chair to turn a human into a Klingon . ( Makeup people started working on our measly 85 Klingons before dawn , and we still would n't get all of them until midafternoon . ) We had to design the set so we could exclude the majority of Klingons when we were doing case-up work , medium shots , and all the work that included only the first row of the audience . We conceived the set as a bear pit where the walls were ten feet high . We could shoot the prosecutor , the defense , the defendants , the judge , and that first row of about 20 Klingons pretty much with impunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we put them in above that , pulled the cameras back , and got them all . <p> Beyond that , we built into the scene a Couple of matte shots which included the missing 3,415 Klingons . In the end , with careful planning and the aid of a little trick photography , all 3,500 made it into the movie . <p> Of course , not all design challenges occur on Paramount 's back lot . For some scenes you have to head to the great outdoors . When this happens , the production designer works with a location managier . Together they scout all reasonable choices for exterior environments that fit the needs of the script . They then show what they 've found to the director and producer . If they approve , the location manager'sets about securing the proper permits , finding parking , hotel rooms , and so on . Meanwhile , the design team goes to work to make the location right for the movie . <p> A challenging location shot was needed for Star Trek V : The Final Frontier When this film was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first season of Star Trek : The Next Generation . Harve Bennett and Ralph Winter , Star Trek V 's producers , had seen my work on The Next Generation and asked me to meet with Bill Shatner , who was not only starring in the picture , but directing it as well . Bill liked me , so the studio offered me the job . It was a $30 million investment and my first big feature . I was definitely motivated to make the location sets as good as the stage sets . <p> In Star Trek V 's first scene . the script called for Spock , wearing antigravity boots , to pop up for a chat while Kirk was scaling the side of a mountain . Supposedly this scene takes place on a rock face some 5,000 feet above the valley floor . Since you ca n't put million-dollar-plus stars at such risk , we constructed a 70-foot-wide by 40-foot-tall replica of the top of El Capitan in the parking lot of Yosemite National Park . The parking lot is about 3,000 feet above the valley floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that when you look out past it , you appear to be very high . We put Leonard Nimoy on a gimbal , which is like a teeter-totter . This communicated the idea of Spock floating in front of Kirk , who was clinging to the rock face . In reality , though , neither of them was ever more than 10 feet above the ground . Everything that required risking life and limb on the actual mountain face was shot with doubles who were real mountain climbers . <p> Part of the challenge of this location was just getting the large and heavy rock face unit into the park and making it fit the rangers ' requirements for safety and usability . We were allowed to use an upper-level parking area ( we were there in an off-season ) to put together this slice of mountain . <p> It was assembled in two gigantic pieces , wheeled across the highway to the lower parking lot , reassembled and shot , disassembled , and brought back to be packed up and taken back to the studio . All of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facet of the Star Trek universe combines the use of a studio set with exterior locations in what I think was one of Gene Roddenberry 's greatest conceptual ideas : the holodeck . <p> The holodeck is pure joy for a designer , because it is a place where you can go to get away from the starship and usual science-fiction locations . You can design an exterior in a garden . as we did in the Next Generation pilot , " Encounter at Farpoint . ' You can be taken back to merry old England ; to the Wild West ; to Sherlock Holmes ' study ; or to a card game with Einstein , Newton , and Stephen Hawking . I believe it 's one of the things that has made the series exciting . All you need to do is select a computer program , walk through the holodeck door , and the sky  --  and beyond  --  is the limit . <p> There are , however , physical boundaries to the holodeck . For instance , if you were inside a program that placed you on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant horizon . But because it 's a simulation , you could n't get out of the ship , swim to the horizon , and look back and see your friends on the ship . The holodeck is a finite place  --  if you walk too far to one side , you 're going to bump into the projectors . We do n't get bogged down by measuring it out too precisely , but we try to stick to the rules . Our following these rules helps you suspend your disbelief and forget that you 're not really 400 years in the future , so that you can believe for the moment that what you 're seeing on television or film is actually possible . The holodeck is a wonderfully creative expression , and it 's good to stretch one 's imagination within its walls . <p> Designing for Star Trek is an ongoing challenge , but it is by no means drudgery . We have a lot of freedom to try new ideas each week , though we always stay within the humanistic boundaries that Gene Roddenberry created . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future  --  a future which is admittedly open to interpretation . Our imaginings are just educated guesses . It would be nice to think that 400 years from now some curious citizens of the universe might uncover dusty archival copies of our Star Trek films and television series in some museum attic , and perhaps look back with warm smiles at these " entertaining icons of twentieth century Earth culture . " Who knows , we might have just gotten it right . <p> PHOTO : AT LEFT , HERMAN ZIMMERMAN STANDS IN STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY , A SET HE DESIGNED FOR THE STAR TREK : GENERATIONS FEATURE FILM . <p> PHOTO : STAR TREK V.
