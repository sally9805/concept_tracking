Universities have always been America 's approximate monasteries , embracing codes of behavior too stringent for the outside world . Deans aim to enforce a set of rules that will guide young people from the safety of their family to the freedom of the rest of their life . Some students arrive barely knowing how to drink and sleep , much less drink and sleep together ; they have little sense of what is appropriate and what is expected of them . So with a pitcher of beer in one hand and a dorm key in the other , society 's children set out to discover who they are . <P> What many learn first is that within a cloistered courtyard , rape is an easy crime : doors are left unlocked , visitors come and go , and female students give classmates the benefit of the doubt . College officials have led the effort to raise consciousness about the problem through rape-awareness weeks , video series , pamphlets , training manuals and posters : DATE RAPE IS VIOLENCE , NOT A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to handle it quietly and try to make it go away . <P> Katie Koestner was a virgin when she was allegedly raped by a student she had been dating at William and Mary College . The dean took her to the campus police , but steered her away from the outside authorities , she says . When she asked for an internal investigation , the accused man got to question her first , and then she had her turn . At 2:30 a.m. , after 7 1/2 hours , he was found guilty of sexual assault . Days later she learned his penalty : he was barred from entering any dorm or fraternity house other than his own for four years , but he was allowed to stay on campus . " The hearing officer told me that this is an educational institution , not a penitentiary , " she recalls . " He even said , ' Maybe you guys can get back together next year . ' I could n't believe it . " <P> The man later wrote in the campus newspaper that he had suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said he had been dating Koestner for three weeks ; one night they slept together , without having sex , and then early the next morning , " without any protest or argument on the part of Ms. Koestner , we engaged in intercourse . " He was found guilty , he said , not for physically forcing Koestner to have sex , but for applying emotional pressure . <P> The debate grew more heated when Koestner went public with her story . Since then she has received stacks of letters and calls of support . Women raped decades ago phone and thank her for saving their daughters . Though the school defends its procedures , vice president W. Samuel Sadler says that " Katie 's / coming forward has personalized the issue and led to a more intensive discussion , and frankly improved input . " <P> That discussion goes on at colleges everywhere . " It seems like date and acquaintance rape is the rule rather than the exception on campuses today , " says Frank Carrington , a consultant for Security on Campus , a nonprofit group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the universities treat it is to cover up and protect their image while a tremendous outrage is building .
