Dear Skiing : This is the year I 'm finally going to break out of the Intermediate rut . I 'm going to do it during my ski vacation . Please send m a list of the top 10 ski schools in the country so I can decide where to go . Yours truly , A Devoted Reader Dear Devoted : Ranking ski schools is risky business and , in the end , a largely meaningless exercise . Even if we had a foolproof method for doing so ( and we do n't ) , the results would be outdated by the time we finished collecting the data , because instructor turnover is so high . The majority of ski instructors just do n't stay put for long . What you 're really looking for are great ski lessons . Great lessons happen when keen students are paired with perceptive , inspired teachers . The good news is that such instructors do exist at almost every ski area , so you can take your vacation wherever you like . But the bad news is that such teachers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a typical ski school , less than 10 percent of the instructors are " truly effective teachers  --  and that estimate may be too high . " Your job : to find those great instructors . Find Waldo  --  and Wilma . The quest begins by learning what to look for  --  and what to avoid . To help , we called the experts : not ski school managers , not marketing flacks , but real skiers who have actually taken lessons , spending their own money  --  sometimes unwisely  --  in pursuit of ski improvement . Here are some of the key points they made , followed by ways to find a terrific teacher . A PASSION FOR TEACHING What are the key differences between good instructors and mediocre ones ? For one thing , our experts say , the good ones really want to teach you something . That may seem like an obvious qualification , but the hills are alive with instructors whose main reason for teaching is to support their skiing habit for a year or two before they finish school or " get a real job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but so is love of teaching . Dick Deming , a physician from Des Moines , Iowa , who has taken lessons at more than a dozen Western resorts in the past few years , notes that " the best instructors have a passion for skiing and a desire to help you improve to the best of your ability . They are physically fit , upbeat , energetic people who really enjoy life . " Maddie Lambiris , an assistant editor at SKIING , tells of an instructor who was so determined to trigger a breakthrough in her skiing that he could n't stop teaching . She took five mornings of lessons from him , but when he saw her practicing her new-found skills in the afternoons , he came over to offer even more support and ( unpaid ) encouragement . " He just never gave up . He tried everything . Finally , it clicked for me . " What are the symptoms of an instructor with a bad attitude ? Dick Deming remembers being assigned instructors who were obviously " at work , " just putting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his watch throughout the lesson and who left the class halfway up the mountain , even though some individuals were struggling to make it down . INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION Betsy Unger , from Greenwich , Connecticut , says that in her experience , the best instructors " tailor the lesson to the individual . They understand what the body is doing ; they understand that there is more than one way to learn ; and they are flexible enough to try different approaches . Good teaching skills are the same , whether you 're teaching reading , piano , or skiing . " Charlene Zent , from Tampa , Florida , found a great instructor only after she 'd been skiing for eight years . As each year went by , she enjoyed skiing less and less . " I was n't improving , " she says . " I could get down the mountain without falling , but it was survival skiing . " Her husband ( " he would stop at nothing to get me to like this sport " ) insisted she invest in lessons . Fortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my frustrations to her on the lift going up , and she paid attention , took what I said , and did something with it . We went back to basics and bolstered my confidence . She helped me to get better and like skiing again . " Eric Goldstein , of New York City , knows what it 's like to have an instructor who does n't tailor the lesson to him . " Most of the instruction I 've taken was about a six on a one-to-10 scale . The instructors knew what to do , but did n't have the ability to tune into my needs . could have been watching a movie for all the individual attention they gave me . " Working with each person 's individual needs has its pitfalls , of course . Lisa Ruskin , a physician from South Burlington , Vermont , has taken ski lessons for 13 years , and says she knows she 's not going to benefit from a lesson when " somebody in the class is either at a higher or lower level than the others and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusion of everybody else . That really alienates the other people . " Maddie Lambiris remembers going up the lift with a class and getting off at the top , " and only then did the instructor realize that there was a girl in the class who could n't stop . So half the class time was wasted while he taught her how to stop . The rest of us just stood around . " THEY MAKE IT FUN Another common thread runs through all the comments : The best instructors have a knack for making lessons entertaining . Says Eric Goldstein , " The most important thing the instructor can do is make the lesson fun and keep everybody loose . " Lisa Ruskin says the best instructors are those who " can get the class members to interact with each other . " Jack Davey , a retired Naval officer who started skiing at age 44 and now lives in Dillon , Colorado , has a different observation about the best instructors he 's ever had : " They skied our buns off . They had us in motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Leslie Boxer , of Highland Park , Illinois , describes the perfect instructor as " easy-going , with a sense of humor . The instructor does n't make things too complicated , assumes you can do it , makes it all fun , and makes you feel safe . " Richard Harris , who has a home in Warren , Vermont , started skiing at age 38 and now skis about 35 days a year , mostly in Vermont and Utah . Harris remembers his best lessons : " The instructor made it interesting and challenging and fun no matter what the weather was . If I skied 100 days a year , I would n't need so many lessons . The mistakes are basic ones . The instructor is like another set of eyes . I learn from what the instructor tells me , plus what he tells the others in the class , especially if they 're having the same problems that I am . " TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOURSELF So how do you find instructors with these great qualifications ? For one thing , you become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that role you do n't walk up to the ski school window and passively accept whatever you 're told . Instead , you head for the ski school office early in the day ( well before classes are starting to form ) and ask to speak to a supervisor . Supervisors are the managers who put the classes together , matching the instructors with the students . Tell the supervisor what your goals are and what you hope to accomplish . More than anyone else , the supervisor can help find just the right instructor for you . Most ski-school managers recommend class lessons over privates , because the interaction with other students enhances learning . The main advantage of a private is that you can choose the instructor you want . Often people put together a group of friends with similar skiing abilities and hire a private instructor for the group . The six-member DeYoung family ( Penny and James , and their four boys , ages 12 , 13 , 18 , and 21 ) of Winnetka , Illinois , hires one instructor at Alta or Vail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says Penny DeYoung : " We 've had good luck with instructors . I think that having somebody outgoing and friendly is vital . " She says they 've had better luck with female instructors , " because they 're not out to prove anything . There 's not so much ego involved . " Here are some suggestions for booking a private instructor : * 1sk for a PSIA ( Professional Ski Instructors of America ) Level 3 certified instructor . PSIA instructors must go through a prescribed learning program themselves , and then take a series of stringent on-snow exams that test both skiing and teaching ability . Level 3 is the highest attainable level and usually takes many years to reach . * 1ake sure the instructor you get has a minimum of five years experience . * 1equest an instructor with a private-lesson " return rate " of at least 70 percent . The return rate is the way ski schools measure how much repeat business an instructor gets . When more than 70 percent of an instructor 's clientele are returnees , he or she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a lesson with the ski school 's " most requested instructor . " * 1sk friends who have been to the area you 're visiting , or other skiers you meet there , to recommend a good instructor , and line him or her up for a lesson well in advance . Dick Deming says that when he first started skiing six years ago , he " just went to the ski school desk and got assigned somebody . " Now he skis 40 days a year , nearly always with an instructor , and he 's very specific about what he wants . " I always ask for somebody who is hard-charging , who is open and frank with me about my technique faults , who understands skiing and ski design , who is a good observer and communicator , and who ' is fun to be with . " In the end , what makes or breaks a lesson is the attitude the participants bring to it , both the skiers and the instructors . " People have expectations that are too high , " says Penny DeYoung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Level 10 instantly . " But being realistic does n't mean just accepting whatever you get : " If you do n't like the instructor you got , you should switch  --  find one you do like . I always ask for an instructor with an enormous sense of humor . " So go out and find an instructor you like . Because the joy you 'll feel at skiing better will translate into a more enjoyable vacation , and that 's what really matters . <p>
