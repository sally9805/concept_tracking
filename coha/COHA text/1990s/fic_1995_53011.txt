The man was in her house again when she came home , standing still and shadowed on the landing at the top of the stairs . Julia Ogilvy glimpsed the tall figure through the window over the stairs as she went up the walk . Her key was in her hand , poised for the lock , but she stopped ten steps away from the porch when she saw him . Just as she had every other time , she stared at the window , watching the unmoving , clearly human shape of him there on her stairs , waiting for him to move , or for the light to change . Waiting for some random happening that would reveal him as real and solid , or as nothing more than an odd pattern of light that collected on her landing . <p> Dusk was approaching , though not yet arrived . It was spring , and the air outside was warm and moist and tasted green . Julia stood there and let the light fade , her key in her hand , as she watched the tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and changed around him ; his figure grew more shadowed . But it was still clearly there , still a man . Julia knew as soon as she dropped her gaze , as soon as she unlocked her front door and dashed up the stairs , the thread of his existence would snap . He was never there when she got to the landing . <p> This was the first time she had seen him in over a month , since before her three-week vacation . Once or twice she had seen him by the sliding glass doors that opened onto the balcony from her bedroom . One time he had been standing downstairs , waiting for her , staring out at her through the window next to the breakfast nook . But almost always he waited for her on the stairs . She wondered about that as she stood on the walk , about his preference for the landing about his stillness . He never moved at all , not even a shift of his stance or a twitch of his hands as they dangled awkwardly from his long arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving shadows over him , patterned like bars by its long thin leaves . But the man never moved . He simply disappeared every time she went inside . <p> It had grown dark as Julia stood on the walk , occasionally scraping a shriveled pecan catkin off the walk with her shoe ; now and then easing her leather briefcase from one hand to the other . But she never took her eyes from his tall figure . <p> He was gone when she went in , as he always was . Julia slipped off her shoes and padded upstairs to stand on the landing . If he had been there in his accustomed spot , they would have been face to face . She had an instant of longing for that , to be able to reach her left hand to the light switch on the wall and press the rheostat flat with her palm . She wanted to hear the guttural click as the light came on , soft and dim , not strong enough to drive away the shadows . Only enough for her to see his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark coat and the shape of the big hands he kept so loose and motionless at his sides . <p> To see his face . <p> She had always lived alone , ever since college . Somehow , her affairs never seemed to progress to living together . All these years of dating , falling in love , and still she 'd never found the right man . She had turned forty-six in February , on the sixteenth . Her mother had always called Julia her belated Valentine . But her mother had been dead for almost two years , and Julia had never known her father . <p> She had first seen the man in her house a week or so after her birthday . It had been frightening at first , when she thought he was a real intruder . It took three phone calls to the police  --  three humiliating trips to her house during which they found no one on the premises and no sign of forced entry  --  before Julia realized they never would find him . She wondered whether his appearance was related to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about turning fifty ? <p> But long after birthday twinges subsided into the compelling well-orchestrated chaos of her career , she would return home to find the man standing in that spot , waiting motionless for  --  what ? It happened most often near dusk . After the third time , she stopped racing to her neighbor Rob 's house to call the police . The fourth time he appeared , she had gone straight indoors to try to capture him , to prove  --  to herself , at least  --  that he was really there . Not just a strange set of shadows that lived at the top of her stairs . <p> There was no one inside , no one there at all . She walked back outside and stood on the pavement staring at the window . No shadowy figure showed . He had been there . He had . And now he was gone . She gathered up her briefcase and left again , not even pausing to put on lower-heeled shoes . Ordinarily , she preferred not to eat in restaurants . She got too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night she found herself unable to stay in the house after seeing his figure so clearly . Not when she was utterly certain he had been there on the landing . Not when she could now find no trace of him . <p> She left the house and went to a Bennigan 's because it was easy , and ordered Irish whisky on the rocks , along with a salad and boil ed shrimp . Then she cracked her briefcase and settled into work . Three too many whiskies later , she shoved the advertising presentations her reps had prepared back into the case . She was n't able to concentrate on them tonight and she was damned if she would let her standards slide . <p> The brass rail behind the booth she sat in felt cool when she turned and leaned her cheek against it . The tang of the brass polish was sharp enough to taste . Her booth was in an alcove near the bar . A tall man sat there , drinking a Schlitz and watching baseball on the big-screen T.V. He wore a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots , and his big body managed to look loose and easy on the uncomfortable bar stool . <p> He glanced around , caught her eye , and smiled . Without considering Julia smiled back . He was tall , a bit lanky , and his jacket was dark . She wondered what he would look like in silhouette . <p> He picked up his beer bottle and came over . " You in town on business too ? " he asked . <p> Most times she would have said yes . These things went better if there were no complications , no phone calls next time he was in town and wanting company . But this time she said , " I live here , actually . " <p> He slid into the booth , facing her . " Fooled me with that briefcase . " <p> She smiled . " Paperwork . " <p> " I 'd never have expected a classy looking lady like yourself to use bad words like that . " He winked . " I save mine and do it on the plane going home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who work for me like to party during week , and worry about the paperwork later . " She tilted her head back and lowered her eyes , feeling tension ease along her shoulderblades . " They call me a ball-buster became I review everything before and after it 's presented to the client . " She smiled slowly . " They may even be right . But I get results . " <p> He picked up the last shrimp left on her plate and popped it in his mouth . His teeth were large and a little dingy . A heavy coffee-drinker , she thought idly . He did n't smell like a smoker . <p> " I 'll bet you do , " he said , and winked again . He added some remark about the weather that Julia responded to automatically , the same kind of small talk she always made with her clients . The liquor she had drunk had left her body warm and softened , and she realized she was saying more than she usually would . <p> " Can I drag you away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " he asked . <p> She slapped a hand on the briefcase . " I 've given up on it . Why do n't we go to my place for that drink ? " <p> His eyebrows went up a bit . " Why , surely . I 'd be much obliged . " <p> " You 'll have to settle for whisky , " she said . " I do n't keep beer in the house . " <p> He smiled . " I ca n't turn that down . My daddy told me a long time ago , there 's two things you never say no to . A free drink and a good-looking woman . " <p> He looked around the living room while she went to the antique pine cupboard in the dining room to pour the drinks . <p> " These are some nice pictures , " he said , squinting at two of the enlarged photographs that hung over the sofa . " Real nice . I like nature pictures . " <p> " Thank you , " she said as she handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He turned and looked at her . " You took these ? " <p> " Yes . I like photography . One of my little hobbies . I have a small darkroom down in the basement . " <p> He studied one of the photographs , a picture she had taken of a small pond near Corsicana , limpid and green under a brilliant sky , gray moss dripping from the branches of the oaks along the bank . " Looks like you 're awful damn good to be calling it a hobby . " He took a long drink of whisky . <p> " Thanks , " she said and drank off her own . " I like to capture things on film . It makes them hold still long enough for me to understand them . " <p> The need to take him upstairs was urgent . Why ? Not for the sex . That was n't going to be any different than it ever was . But she wanted the polite preliminaries over with . She went to the rheostat that controlled the living room chandelier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's go on up . You go ahead , I 'll just top off our drinks . " <p> He cleared his throat . " Why , sure . " <p> She slopped liquor on the cupboard and did n't stop to wipe it up . She was right behind him when he got to the landing . The whisky burned in her stomach . " Wait , " she whispered . <p> He paused , just where she wanted him to , and her heart pulsed against her ribs ; for a second he looked  --  his coat was long and dark , his figure tall and angular  --  he looked  --  as he turned , she blinked hard to hold back tears , not sure why . <p> The illusion snapped when he faced her . He was just a salesman she had picked up in a bar . Just a tall man in his late forties who happened to be wearing a dark coat . <p> Julia sagged against the bannister . This is all wrong she thought , this is not how it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sudden ? " he asked . He put his hand on her breast and squeezed it , hard . <p> And suddenly her hands were shaking too much to hold the whisky glasses , and the heavy crystal went thudding down onto the carpeted stairs , and rolled and thudded again on the step below , and again ; one glass after the other in a rolling thunder of sound like someone beating on a door in great slow deliberate gongs . The sound twisted itself through her head in unceasing cycles , booming , " Not you , not you , not you , not you . . . " And the pain inside her exploded , was blown everywhere , all around her , hammering at her in time with the high screaming voice that sobbed , " No , not you , not you , no , no  --  " and she struck back , pounding her hands on the door she had to get through but could not open  --  <p>  --  until she was knocked sideways against the wall , and all the breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard she tasted blood . She clenched her fists , and they hun , a sharp pain in her knuckles . <p> " God damn it , are you crazy ? " he shouted at her . " If you changed your mind , just say so , you stupid bitch ! " He shoved her against the wall again . <p> Julia blinked against the crowding shadows and saw him , one hand blotting blood from his mouth and chin with a handkerchief , saw him tall at the top of her stairs , scowling face shadowed in the gathering dimness , looking for an instant almost as she had needed him to look ; almost . <p> Then he was gone , and the huge , shaking sound of the door slamming was what she took with her into unconsciousness . <p> The next morning was a Thursday . It was difficult for her to move , but she got out of bed when the alarm went off at 5:30 . She had some codeine tablets she had never taken , left from when she had broken her wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pills , showered , and put on her favorite black suit . The worst bruise started below her collarbone , just above her heart , and spread upward toward her throat . She covered the part that showed above her collar with make-up , but there was nothing she could do about her scraped knuckles . <p> For lunch , she had two more codeine tablets , then went out and used her hour to buy a pair of binoculars . <p> After she got back , she found that the managing partner of the ad agency had had his secretary schedule a meeting with her for 4:20 on Friday . Richard Billings always scheduled unpleasant meetings for late afternoon . One of his much-mentioned management techniques : Always give employees time to cool down after getting bad news . <p> The next afternoon , Julia walked into his suite of offices at 4:19 . She carried her leather portfolio in case she needed to take notes . Richard 's assistant had her mouth cocked open to a precise angle and was applying burgundy lipstick with a small brush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingernails . She uncooked her mouth when she saw Julia . " He said for you to go right in , Ms. Ogilvy . " <p> " Thank you , Barbara . " Julia gave Richard 's door an abbreviated knock and opened it . <p> He was looking out the big window behind his desk while he talked on the phone , his chair turned away from the door . It gave her a good view of the patch of pink scalp that showed through the dark hair at his crown . " Great , great , Bob . Let 's do that soon . Sure . So long . " Richard spun his chair around and hung up the phone in one practiced movement . " Julia , right on time , as always . Let 's sit over here . " He moved to the work table against the wall and gestured her to a seat . <p> Julia took a tighter grip on her portfolio . She did n't need this trap , today of all days . Her body ached all over . " Barbara did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I did n't discuss it with her , " Richard said . His face assumed its sincerest good-manager look . <p> Julia studied him . He had been in love with her once , back when she was a struggling account rep . In the past fifteen years his features had grown softer : His chin and cheekbones had plumped up , even though his face was n't round . She knew he worked at keeping a lean figure ; the partners were fond of reminding people that this was a youth industry . His fair skin , always tanned and smooth in her memory , looked thin and mottled . It was odd to remember now the way he had always been after her to make a commitment ; he had even cried once when he begged her to marry him and she had said no . He had left his wife anyway , but it was n't enough to change Julia 's mind . By then , she had known that men always faded when she needed them most . Eventually he and Carrie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had indicated . " Just give it to me straight , Rich . Is it the Carruthers account ? " <p> His expression became even more concerned and sincere . " Why , no , Julia . Nothing like that . This really is n't about business , except in a peripheral sense . I just wanted to speak to you as a friend . " <p> Her stomach muscles tightened , but she kept her face still . " Why , thank you , Rich . " <p> He cleared his throat . " We  --  the partners and I  --  wanted to suggest you take a vacation , now , before the summer hits . When it starts getting hot , everyone 's temper frays . And , frankly , Julia , yours has been a bit short lately . You 've got a lot of vacation time you 've carried over , and now would be a good time , logistically speaking , for you to use some of it . " <p> " Logistically speaking ? Rich , for Christ 's sake , the Carruthers account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The negotiations are at crisis point , and Carruthers likes dealing with me . " <p> " Yes , yes , of course he does . There 's no question that you have a way with the clients , Julia . " <p> His unspoken implication hit her like a shock wave , about ten seconds after he stopped talking . You 're a raging bitch with your own staff , though . <p> Julia swallowed . " When did you have in mind , Rich ? The Carruthers thing really is hot right now . " <p> He beamed at her . " That 's the spirit ! We just want you at the top of your form for the next big account . You told me last week you thought the Carruthers deal would be settled by the end of the month . " <p> She nodded , feeling like an obedient child . Reluctantly obedient . But she was slated for partnership by the end of the year , nearly two years ahead of schedule . Time to play nice . " By the twenty-seventh , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got plenty of vacation , how about taking three weeks now , and  --  " <p> His gaze slid to her collarbone . She had used make-up on the bruises again today , but they were too dark to be completely hidden . " <p>  --  and maybe take some more time in the fall , we 'll see how things are going , okay ? You know , Carrie and I went to New Mexico last spring , to the mountains . Lovely , cool , all those trees . Why do n't you think about it ? " <p> " The mountains would be delightful this time of year , " Julia agreed evenly , as she rejected the idea . She spent too much time in airports and hotels as it was . " Three weeks , starting the first of the month ? " <p> " Sounds like a great idea ! " His tone was congratulatory , as if she had come up with a brilliant proposal . <p> " Great , " she echoed and stood up . " Then , if there 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing , not a thing , " he assured her , standing also . He reached over and squeezed her shoulder ; she managed not to flinch , although it hurt . " You really relax and enjoy that trip , you hear ? No calling in to see how things are going . Do n't even think about this place . " <p> " I wo n't , " she said . It was true , she had more important things to think about . She would let Richard pat her on the head if he insisted , but she was damned if she would let him pack her off to summer camp . She would stay right here in town and relax . <p> Before her vacation started , she took to timing her arrival home for dusk . She would park farther up along the street , where she could sight the binoculars past the curve of her walkway to the window over the stairs . If she waited until the light was just right , she thought she would be more likely to see him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting too , waiting for the same thing he waited for . They each kept a vigil for something she without knowing what it was . <p> But she had n't seen the shadow man since the night she brought the stranger home from the bar . Once she was on vacation , she began leaving the house every afternoon and returning just before sunset , but it was no good . It was as if the focus of her attention created too harsh a condition for him to come . Or maybe it was that she was in the house too much now , her presence there most of the day dispelling that other , more shadowy presence . <p> She wanted to know who he was . By the second Friday of her vacation , a dusky day made gray with rain , the longing to understand her visitation was unassuageable . She paced restlessly through the rain-prisoned house and could not soothe herself . No drink , no twenty drinks , no hobby , no affair could solace this . <p> Julia pulled on old sweats and mushy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caring where she went . The air was slick and soggy in her nostrils , and her wet clothes could not distract her from the twisting need , the emptiness in her middle where something essential had been amputated years ago . <p> She walked . The streets were grimy with rain and occluded light . Julia passed houses , office buildings , and cars on the streets ; but all she saw was their desolate reflection on the glistening charcoal-colored cement . <p> The sky bulked bigger and darker , then rolled and spat huge angry drops at her , stinging splats that struck her face like insults before they solidified into a hammering downpour . She covered her head with her arms and ducked into a doorway of arched pale bricks . The rain swept in and pounded at her . She dragged at the dark wooden inner door and went through . It was only after she was inside that Julia recognized the vestry of a church . She peered into the gloomy chapel and saw the red-flickered glimmer of prayer candles off to one side . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucifix above the altar . Rain dripped from her hair and ran down her face into her eyes . She blinked it away to look . On Christ 's face was a look of such sparkling agony , of such joyous fulfillment , that , in that instant , she was certain He understood her need , understood what she herself did not . <p> So she sank to her knees before Him and clasped her hands together as her mother had once taught her . Not in a church , only at bedside , for saying little-girl prayers before sleep . But protocol was protocol . What she half-recognized in the Christ 's face  --  surely He would see past the words to her emptiness and illuminate it . <p> Her palms were cold , pressed one against the other ; and for a moment , she was that little girl : scraped knees pressed into a fluffy pink throw rug over wooden floors , the golden light of summer dusk just beginning to fade as she knelt before her narrow bed . <p> " I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " No stories , Julia . It 's bedtime . Be a sweet little girl and say your prayers so God will look after you . " <p> " I want a story ! Gina 's daddy always reads her a bedtime story . Goldilocks . I want to hear Goldilocks . About the Mama bear and the Papa bear and the  --  " <p> " I told you , no story ! Say your prayers . " <p> " Gina 's daddy does n't make her say stupid old prayers . " <p> " God wo n't look after Gina if she does n't say her prayers . Do as you 're told , Julia . " <p> The chapel air was soft and dark and moist around her , the only sounds the crackle of hot candle wax and rain from her sweatsuit dripping on the floor . " Please , " she said . No one answered . There was still no one who would explain things to her , only a statue . <p> She bowed her head . " Now I lay me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no more words , nothing with which to plead for the Christ 's secret knowledge , no supplication by which her salvation might be drawn from His plaster face . She knew no prayer for respite from what dwelt inside her . <p> The sobs took her like the storm , the thunder of them quaking through her flesh in jagged sounds that scored her throat . She was crying shrieking words ; she did n't know what words . The thunder of her storm was loud around her  --  <p>  --  then suddenly she knew the words that tore her throat as she shouted them over and over : " Can you feel it in me ? Can you feel it ? " And raggedly , unspoken underneath , begged , Can you tell me what it is ? Can you show me what I feel ? <p> Beneath the thundering darkness of her screams , she felt perilously close to the salvation she had envisioned , deathly near either being safely captured , or safely falling . She could fall forever . <p> The lights went on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womb of the chapel . Then someone caught her by the shoulders , and her storm was lost . <p> " Oh dear , " he said in a deep , Soft voice . " Let me help you sit down . You 're quite soaked . " <p> She let him raise her , allowed him to lead her to the first pew . Whatever answers she might have found here were gone , and inside her the loss wailed . But she could not give voice to it ; physical voice was inadequate . <p> The priest brought a blanket and wrapped her in the shrunken scruffy wool . It smelled of camphor . She slid her lips along the tattered satin binding and closed her eyes . <p> His hands trembled as he tucked the blanket closer around her ; he was old , older than this church , older than the plaster Jesus . He made small nervous clicks at the back of his throat that reminded her of the noise her car made as the engine cooled . <p> " Do you have no place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head sag against the back of the pew and swallowed . " It 's not that , " she whispered . Her throat felt as if it were bleeding inside . <p> He went away again , and she turned sideways on the pew , putting her back to the light . She laid her cheek against the polished wood and was still . <p> The crucifix was silhouetted by the light from the nave , its plaster face in darkness now . She could not see what was in His face , could not see whether He had felt what this was inside her . There would be no guidance given now . <p> The priest came back carrying a thick white mug with a spoon stuck in it . The spoon handle clattered against the side of the mug as he offered it to her . She smelled tea . He guided her hands around the cup , then tore open three small packets and poured a white crystal stream into the mug . She could feel the tremor of his hand as he stirred the tea . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wet pants to bum her thigh , like a solitary tear . <p> " Drink , " he said . <p> The tea seared her throat and was thickly sweet , but spilled false warmth into her . So she drank it all , gulping at its heat and ordinariness . He took the cup away when she was done . <p> Wood creaked as he sat down on the pew next to her . <p> " What can I do to help you ? " <p> She was facing away from him . That and the fact that her own voice was a stranger 's rasp made it easier . It was like listening to two strangers talk in the dark . " I do n't know . I do n't know what 's wrong with me . This crazy thing 's been happening to me  --  if I told you , you would n't believe me  --  I do n't understand it . But instead of just scaring me , it 's made me feel  --  " she broke off . <p> He waited without moving or speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with me . I have this feeling there 's a part of me cut out . . . I feel , " and suddenly her throat clenched with the simple truth of it , " sad . " <p> She cried quietly for a moment . He did n't interrupt . <p> When the sound of her sobs softened , he said , " Tell me this crazy thing that 's been happening to you . " <p> " You wo n't believe me . Nobody does . " <p> " Who does n't believe you ? " <p> " The police . The neighbors . None of them . " <p> He shifted in the dark , and the pew creaked again . " Priests are a strange breed . We base our entire lives on the faith  --  the belief , if you will  --  that there is more to existence than just that which can be seen or touched . " He said nothing more , only waited . <p> Silently . In darkness . <p> It was that , she realized , the connection the priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . So she told the priest of the figure that waited in her house on the landing of her stainray . Of how she had been afraid at first , of attempting later to confront her fear . . . . She paused then . <p> " And now ? " he asked . <p> She moved restlessly on the pew , pulling at the scratchy blanket . " Now I do n't know . I 'm confused . I feel strange and sick . No , I feel  --  " <p> She hesitated , not sure how to put words to the strangeness inside her . <p> " You feel . . . ? " <p> " It 's more like . . . like I 've been wounded . " <p> " Wounded ? In what way ? " <p> " Wounded  --  to death . " She paused again , groping for comprehension , not at all sure where the words were coming from . " For a long , longtime . And I 've only just now realized it . Like being shot and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it  --  hurts . " Her voice ended on a squeak as her throat tightened again . <p> " So seeing this shadow man has made you realize your . . . injury ? " <p> She nodded . <p> " Who is he ? " <p> " If I knew , everything would be all right . If I could see his face , I know I would understand all this . But I ca n't . He wo n't wait for me . " <p> " Whom does he represent to you then ? " <p> She shrugged and clutched the blanket close as it started to slip . <p> " A brother ? " he suggested gently . <p> She shook her head . " I 'm an only child . " <p> " Lover ? Ex-husband ? " <p> " No , I 've never been married . No , " she hesitated a second , " no serious affairs . " <p> " You 're an attractive woman . " His inflection made it a question . <p> " Yes . Attractive . Attractive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I see your point . . . I suppose . Your father , then ? " <p> Julia hunched her knees up to her chest and wrapped the meager blanket around her toes . " I never knew my father , " she said in her stranger 's voice . <p> " Oh ? " <p> The darkness was kind around her , a secure tomb of secrecy and protection and silence . " He died in Korea before I was born . At least that 's what my mother always told people . " <p> " You do n't believe your mother told the truth ? " <p> " She had a photograph of a nice-looking man in uniform . She kept it on her nightstand . It was there until the day she died . " <p> He said nothing . <p> " The man in the picture had blonde hair , like my mother 's . Blonde hair and gray eyes , just like she did . They looked a lot alike . " <p> " And ? " the priest said after a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees . " And I have dark hair , almost black . Brown eyes . " <p> " So you think your mother was unfaithful  --  " <p> " Or that she was never married at all . " <p> " And the picture . . . ? " <p> " I 've thought  --  he might have been her brother , " Julia said . " But I do n't know ! That 's the point of everything in my whole life , ca n't you see ? I can think about who he was , what he was like , but I 'll never really know ! " <p> He was silent then . <p> She turned eventually to look at him . He was gazing abstractedly at the shadowed face of the Christ . " Excuse me , " she whispered . " I did n't mean to raise my voice . " <p> It took him an instant to respond . Watching his face , she had the feeling he had been drawn back from a far place . <p> " It 's quite all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He straightened his back and folded his hands in his lap . " There 's always exorcism , you know . " <p> " What ? " She had been thinking for some reason , of the silver filigree frame on her mother 's nightstand , the paled photograph with its secrets hidden behind the young-man smile . Both had gone with her mother to the grave . <p> " For your shadowy houseguest , my dear . An exorcism . " When she did n't respond , he smiled briefly . " Exorcism is not limited to the supernatural , my dear . It can also dispel demons of a more personal nature . " <p> What he meant penetrated only slowly . When she realized his intention , she stumbled to her feet . They tangled in the blanket , so she had to grasp the pew to keep her balance . Dispel him ? She had thought this one was like the shadow man , silent , waiting . Not like the police and the others  --  <p> " No , " she whispered . Then louder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not trying to take something from me . He 's come to restore it  --  " <p> He stood . " My dear  --  " <p> " No ! No  --  I wo n't let you  --  I do n't want him to go away ! " <p> He reached out a gnarled hand to her , but she struck it away and dragged her feet free of the blanket . " No , " she said again , and the word echoed loud in the darkness , echoed in her stranger 's voice , and then she was running down the aisle , running from the sound of the priest calling after her . <p> She ran without direction until she could n't run any more . Then she walked just as aimlessly . At some point , familiar streets presented themselves , and she wandered home . <p> The house was black and cavernous . It pleased her to find it so . She did n't turn on any lights , just felt her way upstairs and struggled out of her clammy sweat suit . Then she was falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man on the landing spoke to her in her dreams that night , calling to her in a resonant voice that held a touch of raspiness . He called to her and explained important things to her , things she needed desperately to know . Things she must understand . <p> But when she woke , twisting against sheets damp with her own sweat , she could not remember what he had said . <p> In some ways , it was easier for her , after the dream . Even though she did not see him again immediately , it was easier to believe he had not forsaken her . <p> The rest of her vacation passed ; for the first time , Julia was not eager to return to the office . <p> Putting on her favorite suit , the black one with the wide polished gold buttons , was like donning a costume . Her briefcase felt strange in her hand . She locked the front door behind her and paused at the curve in the walkway to glance up at the window over the landing . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it happened through a haze , as if she were watching a play through a scrim . Several of her reps commented on how relaxed she seemed , and Julia smiled and said the mountains had been wonderfully calming . <p> She stayed in her office until nearly sunset , filing her nails . <p> He was there when she got home . She stood at the curve of the sidewalk and stared up at him , straining to see his face in the shadows . Her binoculars were in her bedroom ; she had forgotten to put them back in her briefcase after her vacation . She stood there watching him until it had grown full dark , scraping an occasional pecan catkin off the sidewalk with her shoe , easing the briefcase from one hand to the other . But she never took her eyes from his tall figure . <p> He was gone when she went in . Again , he had not waited for her , not long enough . She climbed the stairs and stood on the landing . She cupped her hand over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press it , to add a hint of light to the shadows here . Just enough for her to see his face . <p> If only he had waited for her . <p> She called the office the next morning and told them she had a migraine . No one questioned her ; she never called in sick . At ten o'clock , she took her camera case and drove to the best camera shop in town . <p> It was early on a Tuesday morning , so she had all of the manager 's attention . He looked at her a little oddly when she described the shot to him : A heavily shadowed figure photographed through a window while external light levels were higher than those indoors . <p> " You really need to increase the interior light level somehow , " he said . " Or at least balance it . Otherwise , you 'll never get any resolution of the image . " <p> " Black and white film , " she said . " That should help . " <p> He looked doubtful . " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all I can suggest . " <p> " That 's not possible , " she said . <p> He shrugged and suggested she try calling the camera manufacturer 's help hotline . It seemed to cheer him up when she bought the most powerful telephoto lens they carried . <p> The man was n't there that night . Julia smiled to herself as she thought about it , wondering if he were camera-shy . But she felt certain now that he would appear again , on his own schedule , something she could not force . <p> It took nearly two weeks before she saw him again . The camera was with her all the time now , its case slung over her shoulder like a purse . She dumped her briefcase in the grass , and removed the lens cap with hands that quivered . She slowed down then , and made the settings deliberately , keeping track of each exposure . Her timing had been good . She had almost three quarters of an hour of half-light , long enough to shoot three rolls of film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside and changed clothes . The darkroom was ready . Waiting for the film to process in its bath was hard . She found herself fiddling with it too much and forced herself to stop . When it was done , she prepared a contact sheet and printed each of the rolls in turn , without looking at any of the results . She washed the printed sheets and hung them up . Her hands were shaking again . <p> As soon as the contact sheets were dry , she shut off the red light in the darkroom and took them upstairs to the dining room . The light was good ; she could examine the exposures better there . <p> The first roll was a complete loss ; the window was nothing but a black oblong . That was n't unexpected . Too much light outside . <p> The second roll began to show some interior blots of dark and light , but the shapes were grainy and indistinct . <p> It was on the third roll that she found it ; the light levels must have hit a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study and got the magnifying glass she sometimes used for checking ad paste-ups . Looking through it , she saw that the image was clearer than she had hoped : the shadowed figure was perfectly defined . The contact print was too small to offer much detail , but she was closer to really seeing him than she had ever been . <p> She marked the negative she wanted and went back down to the darkroom to enlarge it . She decided on an 8 X 10 print as the best balance between clarity and size . On her fourth print , she got the cleanest definition she could hope for : the distinct figure of a tall man in a long coat , arms dangling at his sides as he stood in shadow . <p> His face was not visible . <p> She drifted for several days , like a water plant , torn free of its roots , that floats downstream . And , like such a plant , she fetched up on an unfamiliar shore . Not recognizing the source of her impulse , she took the photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The woman who owned the shop said , " Working in black and white now ? This is an interesting study . Who was your model ? " <p> Julia turned away from the intrusive question and pretended an interest in an Erte print displayed on the rear wall . She would not share him . <p> " Do you have an idea about what matting and frame type you want on this ? " the woman asked after a moment . " Something simple , I think , to keep from distracting from the image . It 's quite arresting . " <p> Julia turned back . " Yes , it is , is n't it ? I think a plain three-quarter round black frame , with a gray matte about three inches wide . " That was all she had planned , but she hesitated as she glanced over the matte samples . A deep scarlet , sample caught her eye . " And that dark red . A narrow inner angled matte that shows a line of red . " <p> The owner raised her eyebrows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wrote up a sales ticket , her handwriting clear and black on the white form . " You always get regular glass , I remember . That 'll be  --  " She used her calculator briefly . " Forty-nine seventy-two . Will that be cash or charge ? " <p> Julia wrote the woman a check and took her receipt . " When can you have it ready ? " <p> The woman looked over her shoulder at a wall calendar . " You 're such a good customer , we can have it for you day after tomorrow . Any time after noon . " <p> Julia picked up the framed print on her way home from work on Friday . It was ready for her , already wrapped and taped in brown paper . She did n't open it ; she wanted to be alone when she looked at it . <p> He was n't there when she got home . She waited on the walk for almost fifteen minutes , but he did n't appear . Would he ever come again ? Could he , now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoors and changed into her old sweat suit . Her hammer was in the utility room off the kitchen , along with an acrylic box of assorted nails . In a drawer , she found the lightweight-nylon cord she used to espalier tree limbs . The label assured her the cord was rated to two thousand pounds . <p> She carried the hammer , nails , and cord upstairs to the landing , then came back down for the print . Carrying it like an infant , against her chest , she climbed back up the stairs , and sat on the top one to undo the brown paper . It was slick under her fingers , but tore smoothly once she slid a fingernail under the seam where the tape ended . <p> The brown cocoon spiraled open with a rasping sound , and she lifted the frame free . The gray matte with the line of red along its inner edge was stark , surrendering to the image . He was there , right there with her , yet still shrouded from her in his darkness . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face clearly . He was the shadow man ; shadow was his element . He might wait for her , she might see his silhouette , but he would never come forth from darkness for her . <p> Julia positioned the print carefully on the wall opposite the window , directly behind the spot where he preferred to stand . She drove the nail easily , straight the first time , and hung the photograph . <p> The image was strong , burned into the film by the pattern of light and shadow that was his essence . Hanging there it looked  --  correct . The shadows surrounding him blended with the shadows on the landing lapping around her in dark welcome . <p> She stooped to pick up the nylon line , and it ran smoothly through her fingers , wound itself around her hand like a friendly snake . The iron balustrade was firmly fixed , rooted deep in the wood of the stairs . It was strong and the line would hold . <p> The label had promised her . <p> <p> By Susan Wade <p> Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

About " Intruders , " Susan writes , " This story started to jell one evening around dusk when I went up my front walk and saw the figure of a man inside my house . The odd thing was that the figure did n't seem menacing . This image of a shadow man stuck with me , and , eventually , the character who seemed to fit with him to make a story was Julia .
