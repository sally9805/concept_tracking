SHIFMAN RECLINED in his chair and idly pulled a fistful of hair off the back of his head , down at the nape of his neck . " Hey , look at this , " he said , more to himself than to anyone else . " My hair 's falling out . Get a load of this . The doctors said it would , and now it is . " <p> Leo Spivak , Shifman 's supervisor , looked at him with wide-eyed fascination . " Jesus Christ , Ed , " he whispered , " do n't do that . Put it back . " <p> Shifman stared at the tuft of hair in his palm as if it were a love letter . Then he looked at Spivak . He emptied his hand onto the conference table , then raked his fingers along the back of his head again and came up with another clump of hair . " Voila , " he said . " I 'm shedding . Call me Fido . Look at this , Leo-it just keeps on coming . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and a half , but already word had spread around Bowles and Humphries that he was feisty , plucky , indefatigable-the kind of fellow who could take a good kick in the teeth and come back smiling . From a stall in the eleventh-floor men 's room he 'd overheard a couple of guys saying admiring things about him as they stood side by side at a bank of urinals , taking a leak . " I never knew Shifman was made of such gutsy stuff , " one of them said . " Yeah , " the other agreed . " Turns out the guy 's got cojones up the yin-yang . " It was about the nicest thing anyone had ever said about Shifman . <p> He 'd returned to the office just days after getting out of the hospital , where over a period of a month he 'd been diagnosed with an early stage of Hodgkin 's disease . What a month ! They 'd started out with a nice little biopsy of the lump in his neck , a trivial procedure that left him feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake , " Shifman had told the doctors . " Get serious , will you ? Now , what 's for lunch ? " But after the biopsy came back positive , his doctors ordered up a ten-day battery of tests , each scarier and more painful than the last , and by the end Shifman 's chipper small talk had turned to ragged whimpers . Finally , when the tests were over and Shifman thought he was out of the woods , the doctors came to announce the main event : major exploratory abdominal surgery . " Exploratory ? " he asked in a thin , piping voice . " What 's left to explore ? Do n't you know what 's inside me yet ? " He imagined his doctors as a group of pith-helmeted nitwits in a Tarzan movie , stumbling through the underbrush inside him , accompanied by a squadron of reluctant native porters , one of whom kept announcing , This is sacred elephant burial ground-my men will go no further . <p> " Do n't get smart with us , " the doctors replied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lesson about hospital-bed manners , they split him from the sternum to the navel and left him writhing in pain for weeks . Then , just as he was finally starting to feel that perhaps his guts were going to stay put in his midsection instead of pouring out onto the floor every time he stood up , the doctors came up with something new : radiation . <p> But to hell with that . . . now here he was , back at Bowles and Humphries while he was still undergoing radiation therapy-thin , pale , nauseated , shedding , but insistently plucky . He began comparing himself to Lou Gehrig and Cal Ripken Jr . " Iron-Man Shifman , " he called himself . " Never missed a game . The pros play hurt . " <p> The truth , though , was that beneath all the bravado , Shifman was more terrified than ever before , and he thought it was likely he 'd feel this way forever , even if he lived to be a hundred . Sneak attacks of insecurity swarmed over him at odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last , stubborn remnant of his disease clinging to life , like the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto , hiding out desperately in an attic somewhere inside him , making a Hodgkin's-disease version of a Molotov cocktail . This image disturbed him deeply : he 'd always identified with the Jews of Warsaw , and now he felt torn between sympathizing with them and rooting for his Nazi-ish radiation therapy . And then , forget about the Warsaw Ghetto , there was the therapy itself , which was real , not metaphorical , and hurt like a son of a bitch . <p> But there were compensations . One evening after work during his fourth week back at the office , Shifman went home with Greta Braunschweig , the svelte , alluring girl from Accounts Receivable who 'd suddenly fallen for him in the wake of his battle with cancer , after a solid year of telling him to drop dead . " You know , " he told her as they sipped Chardonnay on her couch , " I 'm starting to realize something : I 'm probably better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at anything in my entire life . Is n't that ridiculous ? " <p> " Kiss me , my brave little dumpling , " she crooned in his ear , shrugging off the seductive frock that had already slipped off her left shoulder . That night Greta consented to have sex with him ( " I want you inside me now , brave one " ) , reeling off a string of shrieking orgasms like so many Wagnerian arias , and in the midst of them Shifman told himself that if his abdominal stitches split and his guts spilled onto the mattress like a tangle of bloody rope , he 'd die a happy man . <p> Oh , sure , there were slight drawbacks to Greta-Shifman was n't one to deny the obvious : she hated Jews , for one thing , and for the past year she 'd been happy to tell him about it whenever he put a hand on her . " You Chewz are zoe pooshy , " she 'd say to him in a mock German accent , flicking him away like a cigarette butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All year long Shifman had nurtured the dogged hope that once Greta Braunschweig got to know him , really know him , she 'd see that Jews were n't that bad-that they were , in fact , heroic and gutsy and just as sexy as anybody else if you gave them half a chance . <p> And if Greta 's Jew-hatred was n't enough , he also had to cope with the problem of her tawdry noontime affair with Mr. Hargrove , the witty , unspeakably wealthy senior partner at Bowles and Humphries . In fact , most of the time she 'd spent with Shifman this past year had been devoted to long , detailed descriptions of Hargrove 's thrilling sexual prowess . " He 's such a man , " she 'd moan while eating the lunches Shifman bought her . " He learned certain things in the war-techniques he got from French whores in Paris after the liberation . He knows what to do to make me scream . " <p> Shifman , who could n't help himself , would reply , " Listen , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell me that kind of stuff , OK ? " Greta would pout on cue and run a teasing hand through his hair until he forgave her , but if he touched her in anything resembling an intimate spot , she 'd give him a dark Gestapo look that made Shifman want to cry , My papers are in order ! <p> But now all that had changed . In recent weeks her rhapsodic talk about Hargrove had tapered off . And she had n't mentioned Shifman 's Jewishness nearly as much , either-in fact had n't referred to " Chewz " even once since his release from the hospital . Amazing what an angry red abdominal scar and a little hair-loss could do for a guy 's sex appeal . <p> Late one night he watched Greta 's pale hips undulating insatiably toward him yet again in the dim light of her bedroom , her dreamy , almond-shaped eyes half-shut , her body writhing in a frenzy of Teutonic desire . Wow-here he was , Ed Shifman , the same guy who 'd skipped his junior prom in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had something in common with suave , sophisticated Mr. Hargrove , the Silver Fox himself . We 've tweaked the same pair of breasts , Shifman told himself . We 've licked the same inner thigh , sniffed the same scent . OK , sure , Hargrove had no doubt done his tweaking and sniffing with a bit more je ne sais quoi . But still-outrageous . <p> Maybe he and Hargrove should have lunch together and compare notes ; would n't that be something ? They could discuss the finer points of sexual technique over a dry martini as they sat at a table in Hargrove 's private club , which Shifman imagined as somewhere on a quiet , leafy side-street in the Gold Coast . An ancient , withered retainer stood by stoically , ready to refill their drinks . Charming girl , Greta-glad to hear you 've been having it on with her . Here 's a bit of advice for you : have you tried the position the Hindus call Ride the Wild Horse up the Great Mountain ? Give it a whack . Drives her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , that would be a terrible idea , Shifman scolded himself , and settled back into Greta 's embrace . Do n't be an idiot . Hargrove 's not going to sit around sipping martinis and exchanging sexual how-to tips with you . He 's old enough to be your father , for crying out loud . He 's from the generation that came before sexual sharing . And he 's not just your boss-he 's your boss 's boss 's boss . Forget about it . <p> And besides , Shifman did n't want to talk to anybody about Greta Braunschweig . He did n't even want to talk to himself about her , because the dirty little secret at the heart of his hunger for her-the real crux of the matter , more crucial than all her undulating physical charms put together-was the overpowering allure of her precancer Prussian contempt for him , which for the past year had made Ed Shifman , son of Bernard and Frieda Shifman , Cleveland , Ohio , feel ( among other things ) more authentically Jewish than he 'd ever felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrew school or davening at the synagogue amounted to nothing , he realized now . Who needed mumbled , unintelligible prayers to the Almighty and a bunch of boring lectures about ancient history when you could get genuine , firsthand persecution ? <p> How could he share that kind of information with anybody ? Who was he supposed to talk to-his parents ? Not a chance . How could they understand the kind of mishegaa going through his head ? And anyway , at this minute they were half a world away , in central Europe , as they were every spring , leading a group of middle-aged Cleveland Jews on a lively tour of concentration camps . Every fall they took a similar group on a ten-day Caribbean High Holidays cruise , a package deal that included all-you-can-eat Rosh Hashanah buffets , on-board performances of Hellzapoppin ' , and a Yom Kippur stop in exotic Curacao-The Fast of a Lifetime ! according to ShifTours brochures . The business was booming , with waiting lists of Ohio Jewry clamoring for available slots . So what was he supposed to tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with a Nazi . <p> Perhaps he could mention something to Mr. Hargrove : Excuse me , Mr. Hargrove , but I have this thing about suffering . But no , of course not- it was out of the question . Hargrove was n't the type to understand such a thing . How could he ? He probably belonged to one of those restricted country clubs somewhere along the north shore , in Kenilworth or another suburb named after a Sir Walter Scott novel , where the Hargroves and Pendergasts and Campbells and MacArthurs sipped their cocktails under God 's gracious canopy , and suffering was something Christ had already gone through for you , a couple of millennia ago . <p> When he was n't going to the hospital for radiation treatments or loitering in Accounts Receivable so he could sneak an occasional fondling grab at Greta Braunschweig , Shifman spent his time dutifully following Leo Spivak to new product marketing-strategy meetings . " This is Ed Shifman , " Spivak would say , motioning for Shifman to stand up . " Ed 's recovering from cancer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into submission like you would a rabid dog-which is just the way Bowles and Humphries plans to fight for your market share , just as soon as you give us the chance . " That was Shifman 's cue to pull a bit of hair off the back of his head . You could hear a pin drop . <p> Over several weeks Shifman went to presentations for a range of potential new goods and clients-products like Cocoa Sharks , a children 's cereal that kept swimming around in milk until you ate every last piece ; Kiss o ' Blarney , a scented cat litter with genuine Irish wildflowers mixed in ; and Liquid Paragon , a laundry detergent so powerful it did n't matter what kind of dirt your kids brought home . He attended local focus groups with Leo Spivak , spying from behind a one-way mirror while consumers tried Ma Pinkney 's Ham ' n ' Pimento Spread , with the taste of old-fashioned America in every bite , or sipped a gourmet instant espresso called Montenegro , which turned your kitchen into a Left Bank cafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musk-scented bubble bath made specially for men who were macho enough to pamper themselves a little . <p> He was really living the life . The past couple of weeks he 'd begun reading Advertising Age on his lunch hour , something he 'd never done before his hospital stay ; and every morning , even before he turned to the sports pages , he checked out Delahant 's AD GAME column in the Tribune to keep up with who 'd been hired where , who 'd been promoted , which agencies had lost old accounts or won new ones . <p> Oddly enough , as the weeks slid by Shifman noticed that his interest in Greta Braunschweig was waning a tad . He still thought about her at odd hours , of course-a series of dreamy , hard-core vignettes starring a moaning , sweat-soaked Greta in various states of undress , her lustrous white skin glistening in the moist heat of Teutonic abandon-but for reasons he could n't entirely understand , the taut thread of his desire , the erotic tension that had kept him hooked for those long months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one day he realized it had been over a week since he 'd felt the urge to go down to Accounts Receivable and grab her just for the hell of it . <p> The next night she called as he was getting ready for bed . " I was thinking about you , my dumpling , " she said . <p> " I do n't really like that name all that much , " he told her . " I should have said something about it before . But there it is . " <p> " What should I call you , then ? " Greta asked , her voice trembling . <p> " Gee , I do n't know . Can I get back to you ? " He hung up , feeling like a heel . Why could n't he have told her the truth ? He wanted to hear her say it again : You Chewz are zoe pooshy . <p> With his second back-to-work paycheck in hand , he went to a store on Michigan Avenue and bought himself a Burberry trench coat , the single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It cost more than his sofa-two weeks ' salary , which was just about every dime Shifman had in the bank-but it was a Burberry trench coat , for God 's sake , and when he had it on he felt like he could get a table at Le Perroquet with a snap of his fingers . Of course he could n't afford to eat at Le Perroquet , having spent all his money on the coat ; and even if he 'd had the money , he was in the middle of radiation therapy and could n't eat more than two spoonfuls of jello without cramping up into a fetal position . Still , it was the idea of the thing . Those epaulets ! <p> On a bright , balmy day just over a month after his return to work , Shifman accompanied Leo Spivak to Bowles and Humphries ' research facility at the mammoth LincolnLand Mall , deep in the mysterious suburbs northwest of the city . The focus-group room was long and lowlit , dominated by a rosewood conference table big enough to seat thirty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the place a cool , self-contained , womblike air of serenity . The entire room was wired for sound , with microphones under the table and in the ceiling . The fourth wall was taken up by an enormous one-way mirror , which concealed an observation room equipped with tape recorders , video cameras , a refrigerator , and other amenities . It was pure state of the art . <p> " Are you sure Mr. Hargrove likes me ? " Shifman asked Spivak as they were setting up the microphones . He threw his Burberry coat over a chair . " Honestly , Leo-what do you think ? " <p> " I 'm telling you the man adores you , " Spivak said grimly . " He thinks you 're fantastic . You 're like the son he 's glad he never had . Testing , testing , testing , " he said into the microphone . " What 's eating you , anyway ? " <p> " Nothing . I do n't know , " Shifman said , and fell silent . He hoped Leo Spivak did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that he did n't want Spivak to know anything about him at all , though he was n't sure why he felt this way . <p> Spivak fiddled for a moment with the buttons that zoomed and shifted the video camera 's focus . " OK , just keep the camera on the girlsthey 're the stars of the show , Eduardo . " With that Spivak left , and Shifman was alone in the observation room . He fooled with the zoom a bit , practiced focusing the camera around the rosewood table . He watched through the mirror as Spivak entered the focus-group room , followed shortly by a swarm of women . Spivak busied himself stirring a crockpot full of Instant Pot-o-Stew at the far corner . " Nametags , ladies . Take a nametag , " he said over his shoulder as they filed in . <p> Shifman adjusted the volume dial so he could hear better . <p> Spivak continued giving instructions to the women , his voice singsong and nasal , like the long-suffering voice Shifman 's mother used when she talked to or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were probably at that moment leading their tour group through Bergen-Belsen . It was a riveting image , and for a moment Shifman could n't catch his breath . Hi , Mom and Dad , he said to himself . What the hell are you doing over there ? What kind of a thing is that to do for a living ? <p> For that matter , what kind of a thing was this ? He stared through the one-way mirror at the group of women and shook his head . After they were seated , Spivak had them introduce themselves and say a bit about their lives , marriages , children , work . They were a mixed lot , an aging Our Gang of American women : fat and thin ; thirty-five to sixty , by Shifman 's guess ; white and black and Hispanic ; some richer , some poorer ; a few dressed as for an occasion , wearing jewelry and makeup , others in casual outfits , the kind of sexless attire made for trips to the mall . Among them were a substitute teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmothers , a widow , a child-care supervisor , a swimming instructor , and more . <p> Spivak ladled stew into disposable bowls and passed them around the table ; then he cleared his throat until they stopped laughing and quieted down to listen to his practiced speech about the product . He started with several tasteless jokes about leftovers , then wound his way toward his conclusion : " I could throw a lot of technical jargon at you about how Instant Pot-o-Stew came to life in the research kitchens of Ordway Foods , " he told them , " but who cares about a bunch of nerds in lab coats , right ? You 're the real experts ! So take a taste , will you , ladies ? Dig right in . " <p> There was a moment of silence while the women tasted the stew . Then one of them said , " Oh-this is awful , " and made a gagging sound . <p> " It 's terrible , " another gasped . She dropped her spoon into her bowl and pushed it away , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be alive . <p> " Whose idea was this ? " yet another woman asked . " This is dog food . Why would I want to feed my family dog food out of an envelope ? " <p> " Could I have some water , please ? " the first woman asked . " I 'd really like to get this taste out of my mouth . " <p> " Yeah , could I have some , too ? " another said . <p> " One moment , ladies , " Spivak replied , and quickly left . He exploded into the observation room , slamming the door behind him . " Son of a bitch , " he said , hurling his notebook at a table . " Goddamnit . I told them it tasted like dog food . I 've been telling them that for six months . I told Anita in Product Testing , I told Salzano in Research and Development , I said work on the goddamn taste , for crying out loud . Everybody was so impressed with the texture , the texture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't taste the texture , you taste the taste ! " <p> " Who thought of this stuff ? " one of the women said . Her voice floated through the speakers , buzzing a little on the st of stuff . <p> " What a ridiculous idea , " another woman said . " Who would ever serve this to their family ? You 'd have to be insane . This is grounds for divorce . " <p> " It feels weird , listening in on them like this , Leo , " Shifman said . " It 's like we 're cheating . " <p> " Cheating ? Listen , this is what hidden microphones are for , kid . That 's the whole idea . This is why they invented one-way mirrors . " <p> " And who is this guy , anyway ? " another of the women asked in a voice dripping with contempt . " I mean . . . " She stuck two fingers in her mouth and pretended to vomit into her stew . The women around the table began to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an older woman cried . " He ca n't hear us , can he ? " <p> " He 's down the hall getting the water , " another said . " Like Gunga Din . " The women laughed . " You 're a better man than I am , Gunga Din , " someone added , and they all laughed again . <p> " Did you notice how tiny his hands are ? " the older woman asked . <p> " Is it true what they say about guys with small hands ? " one of the divorcees asked . There was a pause , and a number of the women in the focus group looked at her intently . " Well , you know , " she said , and held her thumb and index finger an inch apart . " Little fingers , tiny dick ? " <p> At that , they all broke down and began to pound the table . Some brought out tissues to wipe their eyes . One woman said , " You 're a teenier man than I am , Gunga Din @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . <p> Spivak turned to Shifman . " That 's it , " he said in a quiet , tense voice . He began fiddling with the video camera and focused on one of the younger women , a statuesque blonde in a tight pink polo shirt . " I tried to be nice . OK . Fine . Some people , you just ca n't be nice . Some people , you got ta play a little rough . So OK . They wan na make jokes , " Spivak said through a tight-lipped smile , " we 'll make jokes . " He hit a button , and the camera zoomed in on her breasts , which were heaving with laughter . Her nipples showed faintly through the shirt . " All set , " he said . " Just keep the camera focused on tits . The bigger the better . There 's twenty women in that room-that gives you forty tits to pick from . We 're looking for casabas on parade . " <p> " Leo , I do n't think that 's such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , thanks for the tip , Ed . Now look , just pay attention . You 're my protege . I 'm your mentor . Just focus on the tits and zoom . " <p> " But wait a second . I do n't think we ought to do that . " <p> Spivak grabbed a large pitcher of water and a stack of paper cups . " What are you , an idiot ? Are they radiating your brain ? Most guys your age would line up for a chance like this , " he said . " This is fun . " And then he was out the door . <p> The session lasted another half-hour , with Spivak asking questions about the women 's cooking habits , patiently listening to their giggling replies , probing them on their likes and dislikes . For a time Shifman dutifully kept the camera glued to the blonde in the polo shirt . What the hell , he thought . It was OK to be a jerk once in a while , was n't it ? Just once every few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned the right to a little bad behavior ? He 'd just come through something pretty tough . And what did he know about anything , anyway ? Maybe this was the kind of thing Bowles and Humphries went in for . Maybe suave , sophisticated old Mr. Hargrove ate this stuff for lunch . <p> But as the minutes wore on , his resolve weakened . He grew bored of the blonde 's breasts and began to zoom in on her shiny nose and lips , then moved to other women 's faces and explored them closely . He lingered on a fiftyish woman wearing glasses , as she scratched a small spot on her neck . Finally he returned to the blonde and fell into a pattern of zooming in on her breasts , then out again , in a kind of syncopated rhythm , creating a yoyo effect that left him woozy as he watched it on the monitor . <p> A couple of days later , as he sipped morning coffee at his desk , Shifman noticed that his hair had stopped falling out . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck in a grooming gesture and then flicking the hair onto his desk blotter . Now his hand came away empty , and he could feel the faintest stubble of new hair under his fingertips . How odd , he thought . Hair . <p> That afternoon he had his last radiation treatment , and afterward , as he dressed in the examination room , his doctors crowded around , chattering like monkeys , patting his head and poking , checking for new lumps in his armpits and his groin . " You 're outta here , " Dr. Lipschitz said at last . " No more hanging around the radiation lab for you , buddy . Scram . Say , by the way , that 's some coat you 've got there . " <p> Feeling oddly deflated , Shifman went back to Bowles and Humphries and brooded for hours in his dark little office , still wearing the Burberry coat . Next door was the art directors ' paste-up room . Layout artists were rushing to get a set of storyboards done in time for a big presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguished slashing sounds coming from the matte-cutting machine . He sat pondering what he might do with himself now that he did n't have radiation therapy to punctuate his week . For all he knew , he 'd never have radiation therapy again . What to do with the rest of his life ? <p> And a more pressing question hounded him : how was he going to let Greta Braunschweig know that he was n't that attracted to her anymore ? What , after all , was he supposed to tell her ? He missed her impersonation of the Bitch of Buchenwald ? He yearned for the shivering arousal of a little old-fashioned Jew-bashing , like she 'd given him in the good old days ? <p> Shifman being Shifman , he probably would have continued seeing her month after month , sticking it out grimly despite everything , his heart sinking deeper into his chest each time he saw her hips shimmying toward him . What 's wrong , my dumpling ? she 'd ask . You look so sad today . Nothing , nothing at all , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please stop calling me that ? He could see himself mired in such a relationship forever , like one of those mastodons trapped in tar out in Los Angeles . <p> Two weeks later as he sat in Daley Plaza on his lunch hour , he was still pondering the Greta Braunschweig dilemma ; it was a beautiful spring day , but for Shifman the brightness in the air was only another reminder of the gloom within him . He 'd brought a sandwich , but ended up feeding it bit by bit to pigeons , who pecked at it with a dogged gusto that somehow depressed him even further . But then , in a moment of pure enchantment accompanied by the scent of roses and a burst of choral music in his ears , he met a young woman named Laurie Purcell , fresh-faced , dewy , a doorbell-ringer for good causes-and suddenly Shifman 's gloom was gone and the angels were singing : there was life after Greta , life after radiation , life after hair-loss . <p> That night he called Greta to break the news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while , " he said . He 'd never said that to anyone ; he 'd wanted to use these words many times in the past , because they had a distant , world-weary tone he greatly admired , but he 'd never been able to get around to it before whoever he was going out with dumped him first . <p> " Was it something I said ? " Greta cried . " Was it something I did ? " <p> " Oh , I do n't know . Probably . It 's complicated . I mean , maybe it was all that Chew this , Chew that stuff you used to give me . You were so cruel . And then there 's all that sex stuff between you and Hargrove . " <p> " But I 've changed ! You know that ! It 's like I 'm a totally new person ! I love you ! " <p> " I know , I know , " Shifman moaned , and almost added , That 's the problem . Then , before he could stop himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , ca n't we ? " He heard the words come out and imagined them as something valuable and breakable he 'd just dropped off a balcony . <p> " Friends ! " Greta barked . " You want to be friends ?

They moved to Rogers Park , that 's what-Rogers Park , where every Jew in Chicago lives-or lived back then , anyway . Throw a rock in the air , it landed on somebody named Levitsky . " <p> " That 's terrible . Why 'd they do something like that ? " <p> " Do n't ask me why they did it . What do I care why they did it ? I was n't even born yet .

He was so blind he could n't find his mouth with a toothbrush .

" Shifman asked . <p> " Auf Wiedersehen , mein kleines Judenschwein , " Greta said , and hung up . <p> Shifman held the receiver against his ear for a full minute . <p> Two days later Leo Spivak called him into his office a little after ten . " Take a vacation , why do n't you , Eduardo ? " he said as Shifman took a seat . <p> " Why would I do that , Leo ? " asked Shifman . He panicked , sensing Greta 's fingerprints all over this .

I cleared it with Hargrove already . " <p> " I do n't need a vacation . I just got back to work a little while ago . Why would I need a vacation ? Mr. Hargrove is n't mad about anything , is he ? " <p> " What 's Hargrove got to do with this ? What I 'm telling you is , you deserve a vacation-and I want you to take it . Take a special friend with you . All expenses paid , " said Spivak , and winked again . " How 'd that be , Ed ? Get away from the hurly-burly for a little while . Get a tan . " <p> Shifman leaned over , his fists on Spivak 's polished desk . " Let me just ask you something , OK ? Remember that guy in the Media departmentBortnick ? He took a vacation last fall , and when he got back he found out they 'd fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing gets a little scary . " <p> " Where 'd you hear that ? " Spivak said sharply . " It 's a damned lie . It 's slander . Anybody who told you that is cruising for a lawsuit . " <p> " It was all over the office . They actually moved his desk out into the hall while he was gone , so that when he got back he literally had no office . There was just a pink slip taped to the desk . He almost stabbed himself with his letter opener ; he had to be restrained . I 'm not making this up , Leo . You can ask anybody . " <p> " Look , do n't worry about it . Since you 're pressing me on this , I 'll tell you the truth : Bortnick was a special case , a one-time thing . Let 's just say he was n't our type . But we 're not talking about Bortnick . We 're talking about you . I want you to take a week , go someplace where it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash and pick up an advance . " <p> " Are you sure ? Are you really sure ? " <p> " Of course I 'm sure . Say , before you go : just for fun , do you still do that hair-pulling thing ? " <p> " Oh , my hair 's not falling out anymore , Leo , " Shifman said in a mournful voice . " Sorry . It 's starting to grow back a little already . " Spivak 's face fell , and so Shifman reconsidered for a moment . " Hold on , though-I still have this great-looking scar from my operation . " He pulled his shirt out of his pants and hoisted it over his stomach , showing off the angry red incision running from chest to navel . The skin on his torso was pink and puckered from the radiation therapy , and stubbled with new hair . He grinned at Spivak . " What do you think ? Hey , wait a second , I could show you the scars on my insteps from the lymphangiogram they did . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan na see ? " <p> " Get out of here ! " Spivak shouted , his face creased in delight . <p> Against his better judgment , Shifman dutifully took Laurie Purcell to Mexico , where they had a catastrophic five days in the sun . Mexico brought out the worst in him . Forget about plucky and scrappy , toss that cojones up the yin-yang stuff in the garbage : he whined about the service and complained about the food and kvetched about the weather-he studiously avoided fruits and vegetables to stave off diarrhea , and so became constipated instead . Still haunted by the sweet music of Auf Wiedersehen , mein kleines Judenschwein , he thought of Greta Braunschweig with endless regret and occasionally murmured her name as he made love with kind , gentle , fresh-faced Laurie Purcell . Then he had to lie elaborately for hours to stop her weeping . It was awful . <p> The day Shifman got back from his vacation , Leo Spivak was waiting for him in his office . " Hey , welcome back , muchacho , " Spivak said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic register . " It 's great to see you , Eduardo . You 've become like a son to me . Maybe more like a nephew . I do n't know . A cousin or something like that . Some kind of relative . Anyway-that 's why this is so tough . " <p> " What , Leo ? " <p> " Hargrove wants to see you , Ed . This morning . Right now , in fact . I 'd hotfoot it right up there if I were you . " <p> " Mr. Hargrove ? Right now ? " <p> " Do n't even stop for coffee . Oh , and Ed . " <p> " Yes , Leo ? " <p> " Think kindly of me , will you ? " <p> Berenson from the Legal department was sprawled on Hargrove 's sofa as Shifman was ushered in . " Do n't take a seat , Ed , " he said . " This wo n't take a minute . " He was playing with paper clips , bending them into a bracelet . <p> Hargrove swiveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spivak followed his gaze and saw dozens of sailboats zigzagging across the glittering water . " We 've got a little problem , Ed , " Hargrove told him . " A videotape problem . That videotape you made out at the mall ? " <p> " Mammary Lane , " said Berenson . " You remember that one . The blonde in the tight pink shirt ? Guess where it wound up ? " <p> " I do n't know what you 're talking about . I have no idea . I never saw it , " Shifman said , and that last statement was true . Then , before he could stop himself , he added , " Leo made me . " How could he have said that ? What was he doing ? How old was he-six ? Was he back in first grade ? He was in a weak spot right now , that was it . He was still recovering-he was in remission , for God 's sake . <p> " It got shipped to the client by mistake , Ed , " Hargrove said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with a batch of research reports . " <p> " Oh . " <p> " Have you ever met the client on Instant Pot-o-Stew , Ed ? " <p> " I do n't think so , Mr. Hargrove . " <p> " Fellow named Gordon Kittredge . I 've known him for years . The Dean of Instant Foods , they call him . Sixty years old . He 's a Mormon , Ed . An elder in the church . An old-fashioned guy . Are you following me here ? " <p> " I think so , " Shifman said in a miserable voice . <p> " Gordon called a few days ago . Called me at home . " Hargrove 's eyes were shut now , and he was rubbing his temples gently . <p> " I 've been out of the office . Leo sent me to Mexico on vacation . It was his idea . I did n't want to go , honest . I had a terrible time . I figured I 'd end up with my desk out in the hall , like Bortnick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 're talking about , " Berenson snapped . " I 've never heard that name before . I deny any knowledge of that case whatsoever . " <p> Hargrove ignored them both . " Gordon Kittredge fired us . Just like that . Told me we were a bunch of degenerates , " he continued . " Is n't that something ? Degenerates ! Twenty million a year in billings , all told , and he fires us because of a videotape . " <p> " Oh , that 's terrible , Mr. Hargrove . That 's awful . But we 'll bounce back , " said Shifman , his voice cracking . " Bowles and Humphries is one of Chicago 's great agencies . We 've lost accounts before . We 'll get a new one . We 'll be better than ever . We 'll all learn from this mistake- " <p> " I do n't think you get it , Ed , " Berenson said . " If we do n't blame you , who 're we going to blame ? We 're going to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven zeroes . " <p> " Why do n't you blame Leo ? It was his idea , " Shifman said in a strained whisper . " He 'll tell you that himself . " <p> " Well , gee , Ed , " said Berenson , shaking his head in a parody of regret . " We ca n't do that . We just ca n't . While you were sipping margaritas down May-hee-ko way , Leo Spivak , your mentor , the man who hired you and nurtured your career and made you what you are today-that Leo Spivak , the same guy-was standing right where you 're standing now , pleading for his job . " Berenson got up and walked around the office , cracking his knuckles as he spoke . " He was very good at it . You should have seen him . Down on his knees and everything . He could be a professional beggar . He was so good on his knees , for a minute I forgot he had legs . He could have sold me a pencil-honest , I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man cried . Copious tears . He blamed the whole thing on you . " <p> " But that 's a lie , sir . " Shifman swayed slightly , suddenly dizzy again at the memory of zooming in and out on the blonde 's breasts . <p> " Well , yes , I 'm sure it is , " Hargrove said , smiling genially . <p> " You 're really going to fire me , are n't you ? " Shifman said . <p> " You 're just figuring that out ? " said Berenson . " What a yutz . " <p> Shifman 's vision was blurring . " Does Leo know you 're doing this ? " <p> " Are you kidding ? Leo begged us to do it , Ed , " Berenson said . " Funny guy , Leo . I like him , do n't you ? He 's desperate . I like that in a person . " <p> " But-remember when I used to pull the hair off the back of my head ? " Shifman asked . " Was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " You got better , " Hargrove said bitterly , as if Shifman had somehow betrayed him . " It 's growing back-Leo told me all about it . You 'll probably live to be a hundred . " He waved a weary hand toward the door in dismissal , then turned away and gazed out the windows philosophically . <p> Shifman left with his hands laced over his midsection , once again afraid , after all these weeks of recuperation , that his insides were going to pour out over the floor . He crouched low , as if bowing , hoping that might stave off abdominal disaster as he walked . He passed a number of coworkers in the hall , including several who 'd dropped by his office in the aftermath of his hospital stay to clap him on the back and tell him how scrappy they thought he was . Now , as he made his painful way to his office , he sensed them shrinking from him , avoiding eye contact . Like Bortnick in Media and so many before him , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Just Got Fired preceded him down the hall . <p> He cleaned out his desk , throwing pens , paper clips , notepads , and two envelopes of Instant Pot-o-Stew into a manila folder . He wadded up the Charlie 's Angels wall calendar he 'd been taking everywhere since college and threw it into the wastebasket . Next door , art directors were slaving at their matte-cutters , and the constant thwacking sound of their labors gave Shifman the unsettling feeling that he was being fed into a guillotine , one piece at a time . <p> Then , though he could n't have told himself exactly why , he stopped on his way out in Accounts Receivable to see Greta Braunschweig one last time ; but when he got there he found the bookkeeping staff huddled behind closed doors in a lounge down the hall from her office . Shifman stood outside for a few minutes , listening to them playing cards ; they were bidding loudly and swearing at one another . When he knocked on the door to say good-bye , Greta opened it a crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissed . " What do you want , schwein . Poisoner of wells . " He watched her hips undulating uncontrollably for a moment . Then she said , " Why do n't you go home and play with your pathetic little Chewish doorknob of a dick ? " and slammed the door in his face . <p> Shifman stood there in the hall long after the din of the card game had resumed . He felt the hair growing on the back of his head-in fact , he was fairly certain that he could hear it growing . But that could be fixed easily enough . Of course it could . What were razors for , after all ? He trembled , overcome by radiance and gratitude . Sweat ran down his sides , bumping along his ribs , reminding him of all the weight he 'd lost in his recent ordeal . A casual observer might have thought he was in ecstasy . <p>
