<p> " " Frankenstein ? They 've got to be kidding . <p> So scoffed the skeptics when TNT announced " " Frankenstein " as the crown jewel of its new TV movie season . <p> " " Frankenstein " has been done to death . <p> Thomas Edison did the first short film of it in 1910 . ANd in 1930 came the one that 's still the classic . <p> Boris Karloff , with nuts and bolts in his neck , was the movie monster we knew and loved best . He made a career of it  --  from " " The Bride of Frankenstein " and " " Son of Frankenstein " in the ' 30s to " " Frankenstein 1970 " . <p> Lon Chaney Jr . had his turn playing the monster and so did Bela Lugosi , Glenn Strange , Christopher Lee , David Prowse , Michael Sarazin , Peter Boyle and Clancy Brown . Just this year Kenneth Branagh announced plans to do a " " Frankenstein " feature , with Robert De Niro in the monster role . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody 'd ever done " " Frankenstein " like this one . And nobody 'd ever done a better one . <p> TNT 's " " Frankenstein " stars Randy Quaid as the monster , and what a performance he gives in that role . Not even the kids Quaid grew up with in Houston will recognize him . <p> Patrick Bergin , who stole the show from Julia Roberts in " " Sleeping With the Enemy " , is the other half of this tragic twosome . He is terrific as Professor Victor Frankenstein , the scientific genius who gives life but lives to regret it . <p> Sir John Mills plays the blind man who befriends the monster and teaches him kindness , until other men come to kill him and he flees . <p> Fionna Gillies is Professor Frankenstein 's cousin Elizabeth , the woman he has loved all his life , and the woman that the monster threatens to claim as his own . When she wrote " " Frankenstein " Mary Shelley based the character of Elizabeth on herself . <p> The locations are stunning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the **30;122;TOOLONG , is right when he suggests those woods are like " " being in Hansel-and-Gretel land . " England 's Pinewood Studios doubled for the Arctic in the ice-bound scenes . <p> The basic credit for this splendid version of one of literature 's classic horror stories goes to Wickes . He was the one who recognized that the story of Frankenstein should be told as it was told in the beginning , and he was the one who convinced TNT to let him tell it . <p> How the story of " " Frankenstein was created has been done as a movie , too . The story is that unique . <p> In 1816 , the precocious 19-year-old daughter of a famous social theorist and one of the leading female literary figures , decided to amuse her companions by telling a story . <p> Mary Wollstonecraft 's companions were Percy Bysshe Shelley , the poet who later became her husband , and his friend Lord Byron . <p> The yarn she spun for them that night was the first impromptu draft of " " Frankenstein " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Cut to 1990 and to filmmaker Wickes reading , in his daily newspaper , a report on genetic engineering and cloning . <p> " " It frightened the life out of me at first , to think of creating life and to think that genetic engineers will soon be able to create races of people just the way they want them to be , by bypassing or interfering with human genetics , " Wickes said at TNT 's press briefing . <p> " " Then I realized I had read the same story years ago , as a schoolboy , in Mary Shelley 's " " Frankenstein " and it seemed to me that life was following fiction , " he said . " " I thought there was an opportunity here to ask a question that needs asking today . We need to ask is it possible to make a human being , and for that being to take his or her place in the world ? Does that human have a soul ? Mary Shelley thought it did . " Wickes ' script for this stylish production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it as " " the ugly child " abandoned by his creator and confused by the pain that hounds him at the hands of those he perceives as his fellow human beings . <p> In the end , his pain becomes rage and overtakes a nature that might have been gentle had it been nurtured . <p> " " You made me and you teach me nothing , you give me nothing , " the monster accuses Dr.Frankenstein . " " Why did you make me and then leave me in this place alone ? " It 's an age old question , even in this setting . <p> It 's a thrilling tale , a chase through dark corridors of scientific genius gone awry that is destined to become a TV classic . <p> It took Quaid five hours in the makeup chair every morning to become the monster . <p> " " It 's the longest I ever had to sit for makeup , " he said , " " and it was only three pieces , basically . A neck and shoulder piece that extended out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hte face , and a bald headpiece . <p> " " The first thing you worry about is the script , and I knew I did n't have to worry there , because ours is great . Then you wonder : Is the makeup going to work ? " Quaid said . " " The first day I put it on , I went back to the hotel for rehearsal , and when I walked in the lobby with makeup , sunglasses and a brief case . Everybody scattered and the security guard came up to see what I wanted . <p> " " I knew then that it did work , " he chuckled . " " So much of this character evolves around how the world perceives him . And I kept getting all these reactions , from fear to laughter and nervousness . One little child ran out of hte room . " <p> Quaid has always heard about the Karloff film classic , and he had seen bits and pieces of it through the years . But he 'd never seen the whole thing until he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He admired Karloff 's performance enormously , but when he read Wickes ' script , then Mary Shelley 's book , he was surprised " " at how intelligent the monster was " and at the very real relationship between the doctor and the monster . <p> " " I wanted to create a human being in this movie , " Quaid said . " " I wanted him to be a real human being with human emotion , because that 's what he is  --  a real ugly human being , who wants to fit into the world , relate to people and fall in love . And he ca n't because of the way he looks . His appearance is the wall between him and society . " <p> " " Randy grasped it , right from the beginning , " Wickes nodded from his interview chair . " " It 's a lesson in bigotry , I think . He is a bright , very intelligent and very emotional human being , and without this awful mask he has to wear , he would probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , in this movie . <p> " " Deliberately so , " said Bergin . " " Usually he 's portrayed as a mad scientist , and we talked about that very briefly , about whether I should dye my hair white and all , for a highly stylized character . <p> " " But to us , the most important thing was to reclaim the story , and to humanize it . <p> " " And that 's what I tried to do here , to keep Frankenstein as  --  not necessarily a good guy , but as a very human man trying to find a new way , like most of us are . He was seeking to move humans to a new level , to make them more intelligent , more moral , and more advanced than they have ever been . " That he tried , but still failed , is the point that makes this new " " Frankenstein " the best and most relevant " " Frankenstein " for today .
