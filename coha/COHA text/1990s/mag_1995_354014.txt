IF , AFTER ALL THIS TIME , ANYONE STILL needed a reminder of why the war in Bosnia must end , last week 's events provided one . A truce had been declared and peace talks were approaching  --  yet the combatants clashed repeatedly in the northwestern part of the country as each side fought to win territory before negotiations begin . In the same region , the Serbs conducted some of their most barbaric exercises in " ethnic cleansing . " Given this conflict 's warped , **25;3186;TOOLONG logic , it was perhaps only to be expected that auguries of peace would provoke the worst excesses of war . <P> In the area around Banja Luka , the main city in Serb-held Bosnia , Serbs forced thousands of Muslims from their homes , separating men ages 16 to 60 from their families and sending them to their possible death . As in the past , Zeljko Raznatovic , a commander who is known as Arkan , undertook much of the brutality . According to Kris Janowski , a spokesman for the U.N . High Commissioner for Refugees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they were not part of the communities . " The local Serbs often develop quite a friendly relationship with their neighbors , " Janowski said . " Bringing in people like Arkan and his thugs essentially ensures a quick ethnic cleansing without any emotions involved . " <P> Ismeta Ogresevic , 47 , was one of the few Muslims remaining in Prijedor , a town the Serbs overran in 1992 . Her fate last week was like that of thousands of others . At 3 Monday morning , her door was kicked down : Arkan 's men had arrived . " I thought they had come to beat us again , " she recalled . " But this time they said we had to leave immediately . Instead we ran out the back to the cornfield behind the house and hid . We thought they were going to kill us . " <P> When daylight came , Ogresevic learned that all the Muslims were being taken to the stadium . She walked there with her daughter and 17-year-old son and found hundreds of Muslims waiting in silence . At 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put on board . Four hours later , they arrived at a clearing where the men were told to get off . Ogresevic pushed her son under the seat and threw her bags over him . The Serbs began beating the men . " They took a group and stood them next to a wall as if they were going to be shot , " a sobbing Ogresevic recalled . " They had the families buy their lives back . Eight were marched into a small building and never seen again . " <P> The terror lasted for two hours . As the engine of the bus started , women began wailing , throwing themselves at the window , but there was nothing they could do . When the bus stopped again , Ogresevic and her son got out . A soldier immediately grabbed him and put a knife to his throat . " He wanted 1,000 deutsche marks $700 not to kill my son or rape my daughter . I had no choice . I had to pay , " Ogresevic said . The soldier told her to march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Muslim women . One lay facedown in a mud hole , a gaping wound in the back of her neck . " We could hear women who were taken into the woods screaming . We knew what was happening to them , but we were afraid to turn our heads to look . " When Ogresevic finally reached the front line , the Serb soldier whom she had paid pointed his gun at her head . Then he smiled and said , " I could , but I wo n't . See , I 'm not such a bad guy .
