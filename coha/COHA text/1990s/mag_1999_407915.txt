Cultivate a taste for wild and exotic mushrooms with these chefs favorites Photograph Photograph // Not so long ago , mushrooms in America meant one thing : white button . Though they are still a kitchen staple today , what 's captured our current culinary fancy are the wild varieties : shiitake , porcini , morel , chanterelle and others . Thanks to creative chefs who popularized these earthy delights in the late 1970s and early ' ' 80s , our awareness of and interest in them has , well , mushroomed . Exotic varieties like enoki , portobello , oyster and wood ears are cultivated commercially and readily available in supermarkets across the nation . In fact , since 1975 , mushroom consumption in the United States has increased by a whopping 200 percent . Mushrooms , especially wild ones , are prized for their rich flavors and subtle undertones .

Photograph Mushrooms , especially wild ones , are prized for their rich , earthy flavors and subtle undertones. // Perhaps mushrooms ' greatest gift is their versatility : They can be sauteed or stir-fried in oil or butter ; simmered in soups , stews or sauces ; pureed for spreads ; and tossed raw into salads . ( The more flavor a mushroom has , the better it will taste simply brushed with olive oil or a marinade and seared under the broiler or on a grill . ) Just one or two exotic mushrooms can liven up an entire meal . But let 's not neglect the ordinary white and brown button mushrooms , both of which offer firm texture and wonderful flavor and are an excellent complement to their more exotic cousins . Although many menus and stores promise " wild " mushrooms , only a handful of varieties are actually gathered wild . Most of the mushrooms sold commercially are cultivated exotics .

Several wild mushrooms are also available dried , but those flavors differ from the fresh ones-and certain varieties , most notably porcini and shiitake , have a far more robust flavor when dried . Although these often come with a hefty price tag ( up to $17 per ounce ) , remember that one ounce is the equivalent of 10 to 16 ounces of fresh . The following delectable recipes have been gathered mostly from top restaurant chefs and adapted for the home cook .
