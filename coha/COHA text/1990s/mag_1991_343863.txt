The camouflage-clad American troops with automatic rifles slung over their shoulders have all but disappeared from the streets of Riyadh . In the cool evening hours , Saudi families once again browse in the stores , examining electronic gadgets and comparing the latest imported luxury cars . In Jidda , gateway to the Muslim shrines of Mecca and Medina , preparations are well under way to accommodate the 2 million pilgrims expected during this month 's hajj . Says an adviser to a senior Saudi minister : " We feel a cloud has been lifted from over our land . " <P> Three months after the gulf war ended , Saudi Arabia seems to have returned to its placid ways . But the calm atmosphere is a mirage . Operation Desert Storm may be over , but it has unleashed powerful political and social crosswinds in the kingdom . Buffeted by the currents , King Fahd is struggling to preserve a precarious balance between secular moderates and religious conservatives while opening up the family-run government to his subjects . At stake is not only the direction of Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has ruled the country since its founding 60 years ago . <P> Saudi officials even claim that the country is slightly strapped for cash . The government has been forced to borrow $7 billion to fulfill commitments to the U.S.-led alliance . Despite a wartime surge in oil production from 5.5 million to 8 million bbl. a day , Western economists estimate a budget deficit of $25 billion this year . Skittish about both the expense and foreign entanglements , Fahd has reneged on an agreement to base a Pan-Arab defense force composed primarily of Egyptian and Syrian troops on Saudi soil . The plan envisaged an exchange of Egyptian and Syrian military manpower for economic and financial aid . <P> The country 's postwar foreign policy has been a mix of shortsightedness and self-interest . Like the Bush Administration , Fahd had hoped Saddam Hussein would be a casualty of the gulf war ; the King now fears that a Shi'ite-dominated Iraq possibly aligned with Iran is worse than coexisting with a weakened Saddam . Washington 's hopes of Saudi leadership in the intensified search for Arab-Israeli peace were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only under intense U.S. pressure did the Saudis consent to discuss such peripheral issues with Israel as arms control and water rights if a peace conference is convened . Fahd has not forgiven Jordan 's King Hussein and Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat for their support of Saddam , further complicating U.S. efforts to forge a united position among Arab moderates . <P> Eager to show Washington that he is willing to embrace at least some democratic principles , Fahd announced plans in April to appoint a Consultative Council to advise the policymaking Council of Ministers . By Western democratic standards , the proposal is modest . But in the autocratic gulf region , any step to broaden participation in government is radical . Fahd first proposed a Consultative Council more than a decade ago , but shelved the initiative when the Iranian revolution aroused fears of regional instability .
