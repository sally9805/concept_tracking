Jack French Kemp wears the monogram JFK discreetly sewn onto the cuffs of his starched , high-collared shirts . His steel-gray hair looks just like the other J.F.K. 's might have , had he lived to old age , or even Kemp 's 61 . But in crafting his own political persona , Jack Kemp , a self-described " bleeding-heart conservative , " superimposed the ideas of another political model on the style of John F. Kennedy . Kemp melded Ronald Reagan 's sunny supply-side philosophy and belief in the power of free markets with Kennedy 's youthful vigor and populist-patrician manner to create a new kind of Republican . Now Bob Dole is hoping that Kemp 's blend of Kennedy charisma and cheerful Reaganomics can persuade voters to give the Republican ticket another look . <P> Jack French Kemp was not made to be a follower  --  the job description of a Vice President . " Be a leader , " he has always exhorted his four children . " Be who you were meant to be . " Headstrong , undisciplined , sometimes self-righteous , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the foot over a principle  --  or a peccadillo . In his talky speeches , he never uses a simple word where a fancy one will do , coming across like the class jock who would rather be perceived as the class brain . That 's partly why some say Jack Kemp tries too hard . But the point is , he tries , and never stops trying . Through nine terms in Congress from suburban Buffalo , New York , and four years as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Bush Administration , Kemp was that rare , even unique thing in Republican politics , an economic and social conservative who yearned to genuinely make the Republican Party the party of Lincoln by embracing minorities , union workers and immigrants . As Jack Kemp has said , he has been to places other Republicans have never dared to go . <P> Until last week Kemp seemed to be loitering at the margins of his own party . A few months ago , he remarked to reporters that he was in his " wilderness years , " implicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative party he could no longer countenance . Instead of speaking from the heart , Kemp has spent the past few years speaking for pay , for as much as $35,000 a pop , to groups around the country . He was n't expanding the nation 's economic pie but his own . Even his role as the prophet of the panacea of tax cuts seemed to have been ceded to his onetime protege Steve Forbes . Only three weeks ago , at one of the regular dinners of the pro-growth gang known as the Five Amigos  --  Kemp , House Speaker Newt Gingrich , Senator Connie Mack of Florida , former Minnesota Congressman Vin Weber and Senate majority leader Trent Lott  --  Kemp got in a shouting match with Gingrich , claiming that the party was forsaking its Reaganesque message of growth . So alienated was Kemp that , earlier this summer , he allowed his name to be dangled before the Reform Party as a possible nominee . <P> It would not have been the first time Kemp 's political career took a detour . He is a California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surfer girls . His father started a small trucking company and raised his four sons in the middle-class Wilshire district of Los Angeles . Kemp 's persistence comes from his old man , who gradually expanded his business from one truck to 14 , but his empathy comes from his mother , a onetime social worker and Spanish teacher .
