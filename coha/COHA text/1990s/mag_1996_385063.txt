LIKE MANY OF YOU , FOR YEARS I WAS on a grain-based diet rich in fresh , organic vegetables , beans and soy beans , but inherently low in fats and protein . Although I was getting a lot of variety , something was missing and my body told me so . By late afternoon most days an irresistible craving for sugar would set in . I was hypoglycemic and this was n't the only problem . My once lustrous hair became dull and lank and my nails broke easily  --  too easily . Just as disturbing was my slowed metabolism and despite the low-fat diet my body weight seemed harder and harder to control . About three years ago , thankfully as I look back on all this , I began to experiment by adding more protein and good fat to my diet . Protein came in the form of eggs , additional tofu , chicken and lots of fish , while I turned to flaxseed oil to address a clear omega-3 essential-fatty-acid deficiency . Slowly but surely , my body responded with thick shiny hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this because of a simple diet change like more protein and more fats . Amazing ! Nearly everyone is deficient in alpha linolenic or omega-3 essential fatty acids . Moreover many vegans are constantly fighting a losing battle to get the five essential amino acids not easily acquired in the world of vegetables , legumes and grains . Although clearly not for everyone , one way to address the duel deficiency in essential nutrients is regularly to eat fish , preferably cold , deep water fish like salmon , mackerel , sardines and cod . Fish is an excellent source of necessary protein and contains important omega-3 derivatives , GLA and EPA , which are particularly important to those people unable to make such conversion from the essential fatty acid , a normal function of a healthy body . There are ongoing studies on the benefits of fish as a food . Both American and British journals of clinical nutrition have reported successful studies in the use of fish oil to treat cardiovascular disease . We should take note of this since every fifth man and every 17th woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some traditional cultures such as the Inuits in Canada and fishermen in Japan consume large quantities of whale blubber , seal meat and salmon and are free of degenerative disease . Other studies suggest fish oil to be promising for the prevention and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , high blood pressure and cancer . EPA and GLA present in fish oil are actually part of our cellular makeup , and are especially abundant in the brain , retinas , adrenals and sex glands . Eating fat-rich fish can nourish these areas and provide a convenient source of protein that for women , especially , is instrumental in regulating hormone levels . If consuming fish presents an ethical or life style issue , you may be interested to know that in the recorded history of the human race , no known culture went without some form of animal protein . Everyone is unique with different needs . But many of us after so many years of low to no fat variations of a strict vegetarian diet , need only to make a simple adjustment to more protein and good fats to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an excellent step in the right direction . By the way , do n't think that humans are the only creatures that can benefit from the omega-3 fatty acid and protein content of fish . Increasingly more and more attention is being paid to pet nutrition and speaking for my dogs , Ruby , a white bulldog , and Bosco , a black pug , they have never looked better . Combined with a good quality dry , organic chow and lots of fresh vegetables ( and when they are not eating fish , a daily drizzle of Flora flaxseed oil ) , you ca n't do better by your pets . Really . YOUR CHOICE OF : Salmon Cod Rainbow Trout Bass Lemon Sole Monkfish Orange Roughy Scallops PIQUANT MISO SAUCE Combine lemon juice , light miso such as garbanzo , mellow or sweet white with minced garlic in a suribachi or a small bowl until it is a soupy mayonnaise-like consistency . Many variations on the sauce can be created with the addition of one of the following : tomatoes , ginger , diced jalapeno pepper , lemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste of steamed fish , shrimp and scallops can be yours with variations as easily as boiling water . Steaming can take anywhere from four to 15 minutes . Check with a knife or fork to be sure it 's cooked through . Generally fish takes about eight minutes per inch to cook . Fill a saucepan with one inch of water . Line a vegetable steamer with lettuce leaves or napa cabbage . On top of the cabbage layer halved leeks or scallions . Add your choice of seafood , cleaned and patted dry on top of the leeks . Drizzle sauce on top of the seafood and cover . Turn the heat up to boil . After it comes to a boil , turn down to medium . If you are cooking sole , you will need to steam it for about six minutes . A thicker fish like salmon may take 12 to 15 minutes . Before the last minute of cooking , remove lid and add a handful of fresh dill , cilantro or basil and continue to steam gently until done . Serve with lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole grain .

Unfortunately this is quickly becoming a thing of the past . Supplement manufacturers are buying fish oil to process for capsules . Udo Erasmus , author of Fats That Heal Fats That Kill points out that capsules may contain " fishy " tasting , often rancid , oil . He actually prefers sardines canned in their own oil as the only processed source of fish oils without the rancid taste . If you ca n't find sardines canned in their own oil and it 's doubtful you will , look for them in olive oil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processed than soybean oil and therefore more natural . Also garlic is a protective food , especially with fish . Another important benefit from sardines is that they contain 372 milligrams of calcium , more calcium than an eight-ounce glass of milk .
