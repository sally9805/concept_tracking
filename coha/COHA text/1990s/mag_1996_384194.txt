If I could find my snow boots , I 'd go for a hike . " Since the last Christmas , Santa had eaten too much . He had gulped down cream soda , eaten cookies , and such . The reindeer did n't think they could pull all that weight , So they called a team meeting and said , " Do n't be late . " We have to inform you that we 'll go on strike If you do n't start running or riding your bike . You 've gotten too big , too much of a load . If we try to pull you , our hearts will explode .

Jolly Ol ' St. Nick had almost lost his job , For letting his body turn into a gelatinous glob . Who would have filled his shoes had he not gotten fit ? The thought of such nonsense made him feel like a twit . For the key , he knows now , is to exercise and eat right . " Merry Christmas ! " he bellowed .
