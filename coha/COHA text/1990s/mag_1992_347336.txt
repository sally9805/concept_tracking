Q. Would each of you tell us what you feel are the most important points the voters should know ? Mr. Altman , why do n't you begin ? <P> ROGER ALTMAN : Well , I think the most important thing for the voters to know concerns the Bush economic record . It 's the worst in 50 years , in terms of real growth , job creation and decline in real income . It 's a tragic record of failure . <P> RICHARD DARMAN : First of all , the Governor of Arkansas has managed to make his state somewhere between 48th and 50th in every key indicator . Second , it is a crucial moment in the history of global economic development . The world is moving toward the U.S. , toward market-oriented systems . It would be a highly regrettable irony for America to head toward a highly interventionist , European-style system of the type Governor Clinton would produce . Those have failed . <P> Let me mention a few ways to look at the Bush record positively . Inflation is way down . Interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. productivity still leads the world . <P> ALTMAN : Production workers in the private sector have experienced real pay declining to the levels of 1965 . Does the Administration accept responsibility for this record of declining living standards ? Do you think Americans are better off than they were four years ago ? <P> DARMAN : In some respects yes , in some respects not . Why do n't we talk now about how things are going to get better , because we certainly are not claiming that everything is rosy . <P> Q. Why do n't you each give us the highlights of your economic plans . <P> DARMAN : The key for long-term growth is to get productivity up . And to do so , you need to reform the educational system so that we 're sending into the labor force people who are more highly skilled and more adaptive in a world that requires greater math literacy , science literacy and computer literacy . <P> Second , one of the areas of slowest productivity growth in our economy is the health sector . So reforming it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition , providing greater power in the marketplace for individuals and small business  --  will slow the rate of growth of these costs so that the economy is not suffering a deadweight loss to the $ health sector 's excessive inflation . <P> Also , reforming the legal system , where we favor substantial limits on liability to cut down on all the things that discourage innovation because of the fear of excessive litigation . <P> Keeping tax rates low , as opposed to raising them . We believe that 's a greater incentive for work and for investment . <P> Increasing research and development , which we have done ; shifting the emphasis toward applied civilian R. and D. <P> ALTMAN : The main difference between Bush and Clinton in economics is that one man has failed and the other man should be given a chance . <P> As to how we think the economy will improve based on our plan , the key to this is getting the investment share of the economy to rise . Over the past 12 years , it has fallen approximately by half . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
