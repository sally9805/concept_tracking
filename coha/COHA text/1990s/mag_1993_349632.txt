As a 10th-grader at a Roman Catholic boys school in New Jersey , Louis Freeh was " very quiet , very serious and very intelligent , " recalls his English teacher , Clyde Borg . " Louis did everything he was supposed to do , " says Borg . " I do n't think he ever got into trouble . " Maybe that was part of his plan . By the 10th grade , Freeh had already known for six years that he wanted to work for the FBI . <P> Freeh ( pronounced Free ) did become an FBI agent , as well as a federal prosecutor and , two years ago , a federal judge . And last week , even before he arrived at the White House for a sun-soaked Rose Garden ceremony , Freeh was being hailed in a chorus of praise as an ideal choice to be the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's next director . In nominating the 43-year-old judge , President Bill Clinton called Freeh " a law-enforcement legend . " That sounded like silly hype , except that Clinton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Democrats and Republicans , FBI officials and former courtroom adversaries . <P> Just a day earlier , Clinton became the first President in history to fire an FBI director when he put an end to the tortuous , scandal-plagued tenure of William Sessions with two short phone calls : the first to tell Sessions he was dismissed , the second to add that it was effective immediately . Appointed to a 10-year term in 1987 by Ronald Reagan , Sessions had been under pressure to resign since January , when the Bush Administration 's Justice Department released a report accusing him of a range of ethical violations , including misuse of bureau planes and limousines . But Sessions refused to step down . " It was not hard , " Clinton said later of the firing , " but it was sad for me . " <P> Freeh was not the first person the President considered , nor is he a member of the President 's circle of friends . But after Clinton 's original choice , Massachusetts State Judge Richard Stearns , an old Oxford buddy , withdrew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House that no one else was ever seriously considered for the job . <P> Throughout his career , his friends and colleagues say , Freeh has been the straightest of arrows , a diligent worker and devoted family man who remained unpretentious despite his success . " Louie is just a cut above , " says Richard Martin , who worked with Freeh as a federal prosecutor . " He has a moral core that really distinguishes him . " <P> A native of Jersey City , New Jersey , Freeh graduated from both college and law school at Rutgers University , then joined the FBI as a field agent . He was a prime investigator in the bureau 's successful penetration of waterfront rackets from Miami to Manhattan , once working undercover at a health club to eavesdrop on suspects ' conversations . Later , as an Assistant U.S. Attorney , he handled prosecution of the case , which resulted in more than 100 convictions .
