In retrospect , the signs of his broad-spectrum appeal were written on the wall in January at Hollywood 's 49th annual Golden Globe Awards . " Ooh , he 's sexy ... very sexy ! " cooed Married ... with Children nymphet Christina Applegate , all of 20 . " Yeah , he 's attractive , " agreed Beverly Hills , 90210 's Shannen Doherty , also 20 , " in a strong , sexy , hunky sort of way . " Added junior heartthrob Luke Perry : " I 'd pay $7 just to watch him walk down the street . " But the final imprimatur came from a truly unimpeachable source . Said a gallant Warren Beatty : " He 's got much more sex appeal than I do . " As if we did n't know . With his big-guy manner and rumpled-bed looks , Nick Nolte , at the age of 51 , possesses a charm well-nigh universal in its appeal  --  and peculiar to the times . He has tousled blond , aging-surfer locks ( occasionally slicked back a la GQ moderne ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold dear : the big-lug Adonis with the heart of gold  --  sometimes known as the Bad Boy Reformed . For years , Nolte drank and drugged his way through a panoply of screwed-up character roles , playing troubled souls just a shade too authentically . On the set of the forgettable 1985 movie Grace Quigley , his costar , Katherine Hepburn , told him not to worry . " Nick , " she said , " Spencer had a lot of problems too . " But through the worst of them , Nolte 's talent never waned . " Down the line , I think , my drinking would have been death , " he said not long ago . Now , finally sharp-eyed , slim-hipped and clearheaded , Nolte is emerging from his knock-around days into what must , to him , look like the stratosphere . He is the star of two concurrent hits , Cape Fear and The Prince of Tides , which combined have grossed $140 million . Furthermore , in his role as Tides ' wounded bird , Tom Wingo , a man strong enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onscreen persona appeared to dovetail with his private life : As a sensitive soul defended by a hard-guy demeanor , he seems a quintessential sex symbol for the ' ' 90s . He won this year 's Golden Globe Best Actor prize , and is now the odds-on favorite to follow it with an Oscar come March 30 , which for Nolte would be a first . " I think it 's clear that he 's reached his prime , " says JoBeth Williams , his costar in 1984 's Teachers . " Now we 're getting the best of him . " And the best of him is very good . " Everyone knows that there 's a great deal behind him  --  the booze and all that stuff , " says Joanna Cassidy , who played opposite Nolte in 1983 's Under Fire . " It was hard to see the real Nick then . But he 's allowed a lot of compassion to emerge now . And as a man that makes him very sexy . " He certainly has all the elements , not the least of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his obsessive preparation , are legendary . For his part as a Vietnam vet in Who 'll Stop the Rain ? he learned to strip and reassemble a combat rifle , blindfolded , in 19 seconds flat . For his role as Down and Out in Beverly Hills ' seductive bum , he forsook bathing and a toothbrush for a month . And in one particularly memorable Down and Out scene , the by-then-odoriferous actor was supposed to look as if he were eating dog food . " A lot of actors would have put hamburger in the bowl , " says Tracy Nelson , who played the household 's anorexic daughter . " But Nick ate the dog food . " Which is not to say that Nolte can not step outside the Method . While making 1989 's Three Fugitives , costar Martin Short asked Nolte what he 'd do if faced with an egomaniacal snit . " I said , " What if I were n't leaving my trailer ? ' " says Short . " He said , " I 'd come in there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing these films , and we do n't have time to f  --  around . ' " Beneath that rakish , tough-guy exterior , there must also be vulnerability , which Nolte has in spades . On location for Tides in Beaufort , S.C. , he endeared himself to the locals by agreeing to address an early morning high school assembly . Afterward , according to basketball coach Tom Horton , " we went on to one first period class . And what was funny was that he was nervous about talking to 25 ninth graders . Like , " What am I gon na do ? " " Sensitivity beneath the Big Star exterior is a killer every time . Screenwriter Suzanne O'Malley , mother of 7-year-old Zack Greenburg , who will appear with Nolte in the forthcoming Lorenzo 's Oil , vividly remembers her first power-broker meeting with the actor at a New York City restaurant . " Zack fell asleep during the meal and rested with his head in my lap , " she says . " At the end of dinner , Nick took him in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nolte 's own childhood reads a little less blessed . Born Feb. 8 , 1941 , in Omaha , to Frank Nolte , an itinerant irrigation-pump salesman , and his wife , Helen , shy , skinny Nick moved with his parents and older sister Nancy to places like Waterloo , Iowa , and Joplin , Mo. , before returning to Omaha in time for high school . Nolte majored in sports and minored in small-town delinquency until , at 20 , he discovered acting and spent the next decade on the repertory theater circuit . In 1973 he opened in William Inge 's Last Pad in Los Angeles  --  the same week , coincidentally , that the playwright committed suicide . Three years later , at 35 , Nolte , self-described late developer , landed the role of black sheep Tom Jordache in the miniseries Rich Man , Poor Man , and convincingly played a 17-year-old . Along with his acting talent , he exposed a smooth-skinned he-man physique that endeared him to legions of tune-in female fans . Throughout his roustabout career , partying , for Nolte , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North Carolina during the filming of 1987 's Weeds . Nolte and a handful of fellow actors decided , for reasons that remain obscure , to " moon " an audience of well-heeled local theater patrons recruited for a scene . When the moment of truth came , though , Nolte was the only one who carried out the prank . Says Hudson : " He was just looking at everyone , like , " How could you leave me hanging out here by myself ? ' " " Nick 's a lot of fun whether he 's drinking or not , " says friend Peter Gent , author of North Dallas Forty , which was adapted for a 1979 film starring Nolte . " But he 's one of those classic guys who just gets funnier and funnier when he drinks . I think when he stopped drinking it made everybody a lot more unhappy than he was . " Along the way there were two marriages ( to Sheila Page in 1966 and Sharyn Haddad in 1978 ) and a seven-year live-in affair with Karen Eklund , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , in 1984 , Nolte wed model Rebecca Linger , a doctor 's daughter from Charleston , W.Va. , whom friends credit with helping the actor to sober up . " I really think , along with a lot of other people , " says one , " that Becky saved his life . " The marriage , which produced a son , Brawley , in 1986 , has not been without rough spots . In autumn 1990 the couple separated , but by this past Thanksgiving had reconciled at her parents ' West Virginia home . " They 're together now , " says a friend . " Hey , it 's one day at a time . " Indeed , while Beatty and other actors worked the media to boost their Oscar chances , Nolte and his wife were in Spain , making an effort to rekindle their marriage . Yet if push ever came to shove , most agree , the true love of Nolte 's life would be his 5-year-old son . " I remember Brawley running into the room one day with a bucket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick would just melt when that kid came in . " There are a few aberrant types who seem at least partially immune to the Nick Nolte appeal . Bette Midler , for one , starred opposite him in Down and Out and still remembers Eau de Nick . " I do n't have a " thing " for Nick Nolte , " she joked to the press corps assembled at the Golden Globes . " I 'm not developing one , either , and I 'm sure he 's not developing one for me . " Even Nolte 's 77-year-old mother told a journalist that her son is " nuttier than a fruitcake . " But by now the others , the multitudes , have fallen hard for him . And in what may be his sexiest attribute of all , Nolte makes clear that the feeling is mutual . Asked not long ago what , specifically , he finds appealing about women , Nolte did n't hesitate . " Oh , you know , " he said , in characteristically minimalist chic . " The whole deal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
