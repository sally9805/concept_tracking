Found fame , fortune and adoration . He lost his way , his bearings and possibly his mind . <p> From the start , he kept his distance . He Showed up at Paramount Studios on July 5th , 1978 , for the first read-through of the first script of the first episode of a series called Taxi , and the other actors  --  they were a lively , collegial bunch , making with the nervous , well-meaning , jokey backslapping camaraderie of nascent team endeavor  --  could n't get a fix on him . They pumped his fishy palm and searched in vain for connective light in his stroboscopic eyes and gathered the full spectrum of his social grace  --  " Um , oh , hi , fine , very good , thank you "  --  which was further strained by the fact that he wore headphones that first day and seemed to be listening to a cassette . ( Danny DeVito , who was cast in the role of the Napoleonic cab dispatcher , Louie DePalma , was the only one who ventured to ask what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headphones , and DeVito heard tribal chanting . ) His signature character , Foreign Man  --  whose innocent , incomprehensible ditherings were already beloved in nightclubs and on TV variety programs  --  had been given the name Latka Gravas by Taxi 's creative consortium of executive producers , James L. Brooks , Ed . Weinberger , Stan Daniels and Dave Davis . They named him Latka  --  one vowel away from a potato pancake  --  because they thought it would be funny and yet not unbelievable . And so it was , and he accepted this decision without any greater qualm than the overriding qualm of having taken this job to begin with . His manager , George Shapiro , told him he would get $10,000 for every episode in which he deigned to appear  --  he would commit to no more than eight of the initial thirteen  --  and the money would increase if the series continued . <p> Latka was conceived as the grease-monkey mascot of the Sunshine Cab Company garage , the concrete crucible of Taxi from which all witty twenty-two-minute morality plays sprang forth .

He would appear in the first episode , " Like Father , Like Daughter , " at the top of the second act , trundling down the garage staircase to ask Alex Rieger  --  the patriarchal career cabbie played by Judd Hirsch  --  for help with English lessons . And his arrival was scripted in such a way as to merely navigate him : <p> Latka Gravas enters . He is dressed in coveralls , with a monkey wrench sticking out of his back pocket . He is sweet and innocent-looking . He goes to Alex . We hear Louie 's voice . <p> LOUIE : Latka , where are you going ? Do n't hang around the drivers , I need you to fix a cab on the third level . <p> Latka turns . <p> LATKA ( in his own language , which sounds like a cross between Turkish , Latvian and gibberish .

" <p> And thus was established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latka moves to Alex , who is using the pay phone , and Alex says it 's not a good time to work on the English lessons ( Latka starts to walk away , dejected . " Dejected " is n't the word ; he has taken vulnerable too far ) ; then Alex reconsiders , and Latka eagerly reads aloud from his phrase book : " Lesson Twelve : Tenk you , chambermaid , for your excellent serveece , I am glad I do n't require medical asseestance , " and then he shuffles to a bench to sit beside new driver Elaine Nardo ( played by Marilu Henner ) , on whose shoulder he childishly rests his head ( this gives her pause , but he is so sweet . ... Then , like a locksmith picking a lock , he begins slowly pulling the zipper of her blouse down ) , and , shocked , she pushes him away , and he says , " No bed ? " and she firmly replies , " No bed . " <p> And this would be the debut of Latka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , September 12th , 1978 , at 9:30 P.M. ( EST ) on the ABC television network  --  Foreign Man reborn according to the whim of others , who had relieved Andy of the character 's creative custody and who would dictate the character 's inner life and motivation and destiny . Foreign Man was no longer his , but theirs . It was part of the package . <p> Andy Kaufman , too , was a package now , he knew . He had grown from a boy with a fun-house mind who performed alone in the basement den of his family 's home in Great Neck , Long Island , to become a thrilling curiosity on the stages of New York showcase clubs like the Improv and Catch a Rising Star . Most everything he did on those stages  --  the oddball lip-syncing to old recordings of the Mighty Mouse theme and " Old MacDonald , " the rhythmic sobbing to the mad beats of his conga drum , the shockingly flawless Elvis imitation , the shuffling of personae and mastery of wild gibberish  --  he had all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he made unforgettable , triumphant appearances on the first , third and fourth broadcasts of the new NBC late-night comedy insurrection , Saturday Night Live . In short order , he was lured to Hollywood , and Foreign Man began turning up with regularity on Johnny Carson as well as lesser talk and variety programs  --  during which he never , ever broke character . But if the sweet passivity of Foreign Man had helped make an imminent star of Andy Kaufman , he seized other outlets to unleash the frustration of being confined to a single character . Throughout his strange , brief life  --  which would end due to lung cancer in 1984 , when Andy was thirty-five  --  he was always bursting with alternate selves . <p> His master tool of anarchy had long been a persona called Tony Clifton  --  the spectacularly **38;3052;TOOLONG toupeed lounge singer who , Andy insisted , was an actual other human being , one he had discovered years earlier in Las Vegas . Clifton , quite convincingly , also never broke character ; the mere suggestion that he was Andy would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , a few months before Taxi started filming , the producers had watched Clifton open for Andy at the Comedy Store  --  this was when they first proposed to make Foreign Man part of their cast  --  and were stunned to hear ( in strict confidence ) from Andy 's manager , George Shapiro , that Clifton was Andy in disguise . <p> " And that , " Jim Brooks recalled , " just blew our minds . " <p> There would be much mind-blowing to come , because Andy said that the only way he would agree to be Foreign Man ( a.k.a . Latka ) on Taxi was if Tony Clifton was also signed to appear in at least two episodes that first season . <p> " If we wanted Foreign Man , we had to take Clifton , " said Ed . Weinberger , exasperated at the memory . " We took Clifton . I mean , what the hell ? " <p> As it was , they got Foreign Man somewhat grudgingly . Resigned to his featured role on this promising series , Andy did what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove that he required himself to maintain . The producers , meanwhile , respectfully gave him lee-way that the other actors quickly began to resent . He came late for rehearsals , when he elected to come at all , which he would soon stop doing , because he did n't need rehearsals  --  because he had a photographic memory and always knew his lines cold . When present , he regularly disappeared to practice Transcendental Meditation for long stretches , often in his car , where production assistants would be sent to retrieve him . Everyone was made to wait for him , and then he would wander back to rejoin the enterprise and pretend not to notice all the glowering . <p> " I defended him strong to the cast , " said Brooks , " but the cast did not like the way he monkeyed with them . They were really furious . It would bubble up . I remember defending him by always saying , ' But he 's an artist . ' And they would respond , ' An artist does n't piss on other artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of struggling actor Bobby Wheeler , came to openly hate Andy 's guts : " I did n't see the big deal about this guy . The producers were obviously crazy about him . I thought he was like a Jose Jimenez ripoff . " Tony Danza , who played boxer Tony Banta , had the same initial misgivings : " I always liked to say that he would n't have lasted long in my neighborhood . He was so bizarre ; I wanted to know who this guy was , and he would give you nothing . Sometimes he would n't even acknowledge you to your face ; he 'd look right through you . " Danza once greeted one of Andy 's late arrivals by accosting him with a fire extinguisher  --  " I figured I 'd shoot him , get him aggravated , and maybe we could have it out , you know ? I could say , ' Why do n't you just join in with us here ? ' So I take the fire extinguisher and start spraying him near the dressing rooms . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . And I continue to shoot and just empty the thing . And now I 'm the maddest guy in the world , because he never even reacts ! I did n't get any reaction . It drove me nuts . Jim Brooks had to take me aside later and tell me , ' Hey , Tony , no soaking the actors . ' " <p> Andy kept his walls erect always . On Friday nights , when the show was filmed on Paramount Stage Twenty-five before a live audience in bleachers , he sealed himself inside Latka , interacted with cast and crew only as Latka , took notes from the producers and from director James Burrows as Latka , and then told them , " Tenk you veddy much . " Marilu Henner would recall , " If someone in the audience asked him to do Elvis Presley , he 'd do Latka doing Elvis Presley : ' You ai n't nutting but a hound dog . ' Andy was nowhere to be found . " <p> TO balance his new career as a sitcom actor , Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. , first at the Posh Bagel , later at Jerry 's Famous Dell . He worked at the Posh Bagel only on Monday nights at eleven , whereupon he donned his apron and began pouring coffee and carting trays until closing . He had not bused tables since his employment at Chop Meat Charlie 's in Great Neck , when he was sixteen , but he had been eager to return to just this sort of solid , finite labor . It was , he believed , part of his roots . Plus , he could do unusual things in the course of a shift . <p> The Posh Bagel hired him on the recommendation of a girl named Beverly Cholakian , who was a part-time hostess there and whom he had met five years earlier in New York , when she was a Revlon model , before she moved to Los Angeles to become an actress and got cast as one of the incidental high school kids on Welcome Back , Kotter . That was when she began a kind of tortured and volatile , though loving , affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to call an overzealous busboy , in that he liked to remove people 's food before they had finished it and often before they had even touched it . " They would get very upset , " said Cholakian . " They would want the food replaced . Many times I 'd have to say to him , ' OK , you 've done enough tonight , you can leave now . ' " <p> Gregg Sutton , who was Andy 's musical conductor for concert appearances , remembered dropping by to say hello on a night when Richard Gere was seated in a back booth with a beautiful woman  --  " And Andy would n't leave them alone . He kept coming by and asking , ' Would you like more coffee ? ' Over and over and over again . Gere said , ' Quit bugging me !

He 's screaming , ' What are you doing , you stupid idiot ! ' And Andy 's saying , ' Oh , gosh , I 'm sorry , ' and trying to clean up but only making it worse , pushing the coffee all over them . It was hilarious . " And then some reporters found out he was working as a busboy , and he told them that he did it " because it keeps me in touch with people . Because no matter how famous I may become from show business , I always hope that I could keep my head out of the clouds and remain , you know , just a regular human being . I 'm just a human being . And working as a busboy reminds me of this . " <p> " Taxi " debuted to glowing reviews from critics , who reveled in the show 's emotional texture and intelligence . " There has never before been a sitcom written with the dramatic depth of this one , " Frank Rich declared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaufman brings a saving sweetness to the garage mechanic who speaks his own variety of fractured English . " Dean of TV critics Marvin Kitman enthused in Newsday , " What an inspiration it was to make Andy Kaufman a regular on a sitcom . It 's something to look forward to every Tuesday night . The whole country will be doing their Latka Gravas imitations by next month . " <p> On Monday , October 2nd , three weeks after the series premiered , rehearsals began for the tenth episode which was the one , the producers had agreed , that would feature guest actor Tony Clifton , who would play Louie DePalma 's card-shark brother , Nicky , from Las Vegas . Written solely to facilitate the Clifton contract , the episode was titled " Brother Rat " but was changed to " A Full House for Christmas " by the time it was broadcast in December ; by then , all traces of Clifton were long gone , except in the memories of those who had seen it through from genesis to debacle . <p> A month earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taped diary of his adventures in managing the colorful career of Andy Kaufman . On the afternoon of Thursday , September 28th , he got a call from Taxi casting director Rhonda Young , who was on the set when scripts of the " Brother Rat " show were distributed among the regular cast , and all of them wondered who this Tony Clifton was and why he was playing this role . <p> From Shapiro 's taped diary : <p> The full cast was sitting around the table , and Judd Hirsch asked , " Who is Tony Clifton ? " And Rhonda said , " He 's a good actor ; he 's like Danny DeVito 's character  --  he 's a mean and coarse kind of a guy , a real rat . That 's why he got the role . " After the meeting was over , Rhonda went over to nudge Andy and said , " Hey , I did good , did n't I ? " As if to say , " I covered up pretty good , did n't I ? " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real Tony Clifton is going to be here . I only imitated Tony Clifton . I know you came into the Comedy Store and saw that performance , but I 'm not going to be here . I 'm going away for three weeks . Next week , the real Tony Clifton is going to be here to play that part . " <p> But no one would be especially fooled , because Ed . Weinberger  --  who had been sworn to secrecy by Shapiro  --  soon began taking the actors aside , according to Randall Carver ( who played yokel cabby John Burns ) , to tell each of them that " Andy was n't going to be in the next episode , but this lounge singer from Las Vegas , who might resemble Andy but was n't Andy , would be there instead . And we all kind of scratched our heads . " Thus the word spread and the concerns simmered . Danza : " ! Do n't talk to him as if he 's Andy '  --  that 's what we were told . ' Buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' It 's Andy but it is n't Andy ; just play along . ' " Conaway : " I said , ' You got ta be kidding ! Everything 's always revolving around this guy , because he 's always making us wait for him ! And now you 're saying we have to talk to him as somebody else ? ' I was the last one to agree to go along with it . " Weinberger recalled telling them nothing more than that a new actor had been hired to appear in the next show , and their patience would be most appreciated . <p> Clifton , meanwhile , now required ever-greater measures of obfuscation and disguise . For Clifton to appear , Andy could be nowhere in sight . His friend and frequent collaborator Bob Zmuda arranged to employ the talents of makeup artist Ken Chase , who had done memorable work for the television miniseries Roots , and Chase would design new and appalling facial prosthetics contoured to transform one enigma into another . The week before the taping , Andy and Zmuda and assistant Linda Mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cast was made of Andy 's head . <p> " He meditated in his car for one hour before he came in to let me take the cast , " Chase said . " Then the girl would hold his hand and count out loud while the impression cream was hardening . He was very eccentric . " Foam-latex applications were then created to approximate ruddy cheeks and fleshy jowls and a bulbous nose . " Our intent , " said Chase , " was to make him as physically obnoxious as possible . The cleft in the chin was my idea . Something about a cleft on a guy like that seemed particularly repulsive . " Chase also supplied ungainly sideburns and a cheap toupee ( " purposefully obvious " ) and a big " Burt Reynolds " mustache , and Mitchell got the unspeakable salmon-hued embroidered tuxedo with black lapels and piping ( " That was a find , " she said , having plucked it from the racks of " a cheesy men 's store on Sunset " ) , and also the turquoise ruffled shirt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . And so they would report to Chase 's home each morning before Clifton and entourage headed for the set , and the application process would take just over two hours  --  " Before he would let me make him up , " Chase said , " he 'd blow his nose twenty , thirty , forty times . Very kooky . And the minute the makeup was completed , his personality changed . Andy did n't exist anymore . " <p> Because Clifton refused to occupy Andy 's dressing room , an enormous Winnebago trailer ( with fully stocked bar ) was procured by Weinberger and , by most accounts , two bona fide call girls , very tall and blond and accommodating , were hired to dally with Clifton all week . ( Weinberger maintained that they were extras , not pros . ) Also , Linda Mitchell , a brunette , became Clifton 's brassy blond-wigged secretary , Ginger Sax ; Bob Zmuda was his zoot-suited handler , Bugsy Meyer . They arrived at the Paramount gates in a rented pink Cadillac . <p> Monday was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the brothers DePalma stage a poker game to decide which of them will entertain their mother for the holidays , and that morning the actors all gathered to begin business . <p> According to Shapiro 's diary : Tony Clifton came to work five minutes early , and he complained about the other people when they came in late . <p> This ploy was intended , of course , to further divert suspicion from Andy . And so there they all sat , gawking at him , stifling laughter , stifling irritation , as he hid behind sunglasses and beneath latex , and they saw that the orangy-spongy makeup stopped at his ears , and it was Conaway sitting beside him who first smelled the remarkable BO  --  or was it cologne ? or whiskey ?  --  and Clifton lit up his Camels and swigged from his pint of Jack Daniel 's , and they knew Andy never drank or smoked . But Clifton actually tried to be congenial and made much reference to Las Vegas and bleated his dialogue as abrasively as possible ( " Louie , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaaaaaad ! " ) , altering it beyond anything recognizably written on the page . <p> " You wanted to take a bath after you 'd been in the room with him , " Henner said . " He was just sickening , always going , ' Hey , pretty lady , how ya doin ' , baby ! ' He kept coming on to me , which Andy never did . " In fact , he chased whatever " chickaroonies " materialized before him , offering free trips to Vegas and intimate tours of his Winnebago ; and it was soon eminently clear that Clifton was in no way capable of acting any part other than that of himself . <p> " His reading was terrible , " said Weinberger . " And the cast was looking at me , and I just saw that this was gon na be a bitch . Then Tuesday we had a run-through , and that was a disaster . This was not acting . He did not mesh , not even remotely . So I realized that I had to get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show to make an episode you could n't air . So at the end of the day I called George and said , ' Look , I have to fire him . ' He said , ' Well , you know , Andy 's gon na be devastated . ' I said , ' I have no choice , you know ? ' So he said , ' Well , you have to explain it to hip . ' He told me Andy could walk , might leave the show and take both Tony Clifton and Latka with him . So I called Tony in his Winnebago and asked if Andy could come up to the office , and I think it was Andy who then came up and sat on my couch , and I was very tentative because I did n't want to offend or lose Andy . But I said , ' I have to tell you : Tony Clifton is not an actor . You know , he 's a lounge performer . He is just too big for this room ; he overpowers this whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to fit . He ca n't do it . ' <p> " And I 'm very relieved and surprised when he very quickly said , ' I agree with you . But what are you gon na do ? ' And I said , ' Well , I have to fire him . ' I 'm very careful to say ' him ' and not ' you . ' And Andy agreed  --  as always , he was very deferential and polite and soft-spoken , but he said , ' OK , but would you do me a favor ? Would you fire him tomorrow , but not because he 's a bad actor ? Could you fire him because he 's late and comes in drunk or something ? I 'll have Tony come in late after lunch and then you fire him in front of everybody and say you had to hire another actor because he did n't show up . ' And I said , ' Yes , I could do that . ' And I saw that this would be theater for him . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shapiro 's diary : <p> Ed . Weinberger called me just now to tell me how he 's going to fire Tony Clifton . From what I understand , he 's going to do this in front of the entire cast and crew tomorrow . And it 's going to be part of , let 's say , " theater of life , " which is what Andy loves . They are going to put on a total scene , and a reporter from the " Los Angeles Times , " Bill Knoedelseder , will also be there tomorrow because he has been writing a piece about Andy . This whole situation is one of the most bizarre things I have ever witnessed . Really very bizarre . And exciting and interesting and crazy . I 'm going to be there tomorrow for the firing . ... <p> Today is October 4th ; it 's Wednesday morning . I found out through the casting director Rhonda Young that they have already hired an actor to take over Tony Clifton 's part today . His name is Richard Foronjy . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the " Times " reporter who was supposed to interview Tony coming at 2:30 , and the rest of the cast is also coming at 2:30 . And I 'll be there at 2:30 . <p> Ginger Sax , Clifton 's " secretary , " was dispatched to buy gifts for the cast and producers , which were to be personally distributed by Clifton and his two blond hookers after lunch on Wednesday . Cards were attached bearing uncommonly warm sentiments  --  " It 's a pleasure working with you . I 'm proud to be a member of the cast of Taxi . P.S. Let 's all break a leg on Friday . Love , Tony ' Nick ' Clifton . " The gifts were little remote-controlled , battery-operated toy dogs that walked and barked and wagged their tails , and each actor received one and began to play with his/her dog , into which Ginger had already installed batteries , and they all seemed sort of touched by the gesture , and certainly amused  --  except for Conaway , who took his yapping dog and smashed it against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at least fifty people sitting in the bleachers after lunch , since this was just a Wednesday rehearsal and usually only crew and staff members were present for such routine business . Tony Danza , however , clearly knew something was going to happen , because he brought a homemovie camera with him and told the technicians to light the stage when Clifton walked in . And George , of course , sensing history , brought his portable tape recorder so that he might describe the action beheld from his seat in the bleachers . And he urged Bill Knoedelseder to bring a camera , in case any photo opportunities arose . And Weinberger  --  quite aware of his role in the imminent mayhem  --  instructed crew members to call his office the minute Clifton arrived on Stage Twenty-five . <p> Shapiro reported : <p> It 's 2:30 P.m. and I 'm sitting up here with Rhonda Young , the famous casting director , and Ginger Sax , Tony Clifton 's secretary/assistant . Ginger is a very pretty lady with blond curly hair and a very sexy green gown  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , obviously . <p> Clifton entered here with his flanks . Tony is now giving out gifts to all the members of the cast . Danny DeVito has a big smile on his face as he is opening up his gift . Judd Hirsch said , " Something 's ticking in here . " Randy Carver has a big smile on his face . Much laughter can be heard . There are a lot of little stuffed animals running around the reading table now  --  there 's a little Scottie dog , a whole bunch of different dogs . They are adorable ! It 's absolutely adorable . Tony came out with these two young ladies who were in the trailer with him  --  a blonde and another blonde . The blondes are completely breaking up ; everyone is breaking up . Tony Danza has a movie camera ; he 's taking pictures of all the animals . This is sensational . Clifton is walking around in his peach tuxedo with black velvet collar and blue shirt . He just said , " Let 's get back to work ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have to talk to Ed . Weinberger about a script change . " Clifton just said that he rented a place and invited the whole cast to a party there after filming on Friday . He 's really being very friendly right now to the cast . <p> Weinberger just walked on the set  --  the executive producer and spokesman for the producing team . Tony just handed Weinberger a very nice gift , and Ed. immediately handed it off to the executive in charge of production , Ron Frazier , who put it on the cab in the garage set . Now they are having a conference in the corner of the stage , away from everybody . <p> Weinberger recalled , " I came on the stage , which was cluttered with all these little mechanical things tottering around . Clifton actually had the same walk as these toys did , which I 'll never forget . He was taking swigs from a pint of whiskey and saying that he just rewrote the script of the show during lunch . He told me that he wrote parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to play my role as irate producer ' Tony , I warned you about this ! You 're late ! I 've hired another actor , so get off the stage  --  you 're fired ! ' I thought it would be over . It was n't . He would n't leave . He waved the script in my face and said , ' Here , read my changes ! ' And I ripped the script out of his hands and threw it away . He then held out his liquor  --  ' Here , have a drink ! ' Everybody was now watching us , and I was getting slowly pissed , because he was betraying our agreement . But he just walked away from me . " <p> From Shapiro : Now Tony is walking back to center stage , and he 's singing , " Let 's get this show on the road , let 's go ! " He sits down at the table and tells the two girls , " Come on , sit on my lap . " Each girl is sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frazier went over and is talking to him , and Tony said , " Getcha hands off me ! Getcha hands off me ! Who the hell are you ? " No one had touched him yet . Ed . Weinberget is calling me , as Tony 's manager , onto the stage . I 'm now walking down there to get him out . All sorts of commotion ; Tony 's yelling , " I 'm calling the cops ! Getcha hands off me ! I 'm calling the cops ! " <p> Shapiro 's tape captured various screams from various players , and yet it could not wholly contain the breadth of emotional forensics that engulfed the stage . Voices of order implored that valuable time was being squandered and that there was an actual show to work on . Voices of exasperation hulled into corners . Rages steeped or blew . Conaway had already moved toward Clifton once . " I wanted to hit him , " he remembered . " And Jim Burrows grabbed me and said , ' No , Jeff , you should leave now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 'm gon na kill him ! ' He said , ' That 's why you have to leave ! ' " Then he retreated . Danza kept filming everything , and Hirsch watched until he could watch no longer . " I felt responsible for the show , " he said later , " and I thought I better help get rid of this guy . " And Weinberger told Clifton to leave with George , and Clifton hollered , " Where 's the director ! Let 's get to work ! I am waiting for everybody ! " And finally security was called and three Paramount cops arrived , and they knew nothing about any theater-of-life bullshit and therefore lunged very seriously for Clifton , who yelled , " I got a contract here , I got a contract ! " Whereupon Hirsch announced to no one in particular , " He wants a psychodrama ? I 'll give him a psychodrama ! " And his eyes flared with a menace that no one had seen before and he stalked toward Clifton and bellowed , " You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a contract with a whole lot more shows than you got ! Get off this set ! " And he began throttling Clifton while the guards yanked at the foul tuxedo and Clifton yelped , " Getcha hands off me ! " <p> And everyone applauded , except for Shapiro , who shouted , " Do n't hurt him ! He 's a talented man ! He 's talented ! " And the guards and Hirsch dragged Clifton to the doors , and he screamed , " Fuck you ! I will be back one day when I play Vegas ! None of you will get in when I play ! I 'll be a big star ! You wait and see ! You wait and see ! Getcha hands off me , I 'm going back in there ! I am not going to put up with this crap ! " And he was out of the building , and Knoedelseder was snapping his newspaper photographs throughout , and Hirsch left the security men to complete their task outside , and he recalled , " I had no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true body I was shoving off the stage was Andy Kaufman . Then I started to realize that I was n't throwing out Andy Kaufman ; I was throwing out Tony Clifton , which was a phantom , a fiction , a fiction with a real body . And how Andy Kaufman comes back and becomes Andy Kaufman again was no mystery to him , only to the rest of us . " <p> AND SO : GUARDS ROUGHED CLIFTON up all the way to the studio gate , with Shapiro scurrying behind decrying the violence while Knoedelseder endured harassment because security wanted to take his camera , which he dutifully kept shooting until Bugsy Meyer ( Zmuda ) strode forth , feigning higher authority , and confiscated the camera and ran with it in the opposite direction to another edge of the Paramount lot and handed it off to an accomplice , who sped away to safety , because Andy wanted those photographs protected and later had Shapiro get copies of the negatives from Knoedelseder , whose camera was quietly returned after the incident . Meanwhile , Ginger Sax collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the block at Nickodel 's coffee shop , where he immediately used the pay phone to call Weinberger in his office : " My secretary said Andy Kaufman was on the line , so I picked up and he said , ' Ed. , is anybody there listening ? ' I said , ' No , just you and me . ' He said , ' I 'm calling from a phone booth , and I just wanted to say that you were brilliant ! ' And I said , ' Thank you , ' and he said he would see me in a couple of weeks when Latka returned , and that was the end of the conversation . " Clifton , however , was banned from ever setting foot on Paramount property again . <p> Shapiro reported : <p> So now I 'm driving home , feeling pretty good about the day . We got away with a crazy thing . Why we did it , I do n't know . It 's Andy 's craziness . It was nourishing Andy 's insanity . And I was supporting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called me when I got back to the office after this incredible escapade , and he was totally exhilarated . He was thrilled . He said , " Was n't it great ! Was n't it fantastic ! I think this is fantastic ! It was a part I always wanted to play ! It gave realness , a validity to Tony Clifton 's character , and I think this is going to be good for his career . I think he 's going to get other jobs . " And he was as high as a kite . So I allowed him to be high . I told him one thing , which I felt was very true : What he went out to accomplish , he did . He really acted out a role he wanted to play . As crazy as his goal was , he did reach it . And that 's OK with him , and that 's OK with me . <p> Incidentally , I was told that Andy Kaufman is scoring tremendously as the character Latka Gravas on " Taxi . " They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the roof . <p> The Clifton triumph was such that nobody cared except Andy , and also Zmuda , and , although Shapiro was happy for his client , Shapiro could live without this tsuris , to be sure , and mostly everybody who witnessed it wanted to forget it ( at least for the time being ) . Army Archerd , the columnist for Variety , got wind and thought about running an item , but Weinberger told him that Clifton had a serious drinking problem and the less said about it the better . And Andy wanted to take out an ad in the trades to trumpet Clifton 's mistreatment at the hands of Paramount and Taxi personnel , but Weinberger told Shapiro that the less said about it the better . <p> Knoedelseder , meanwhile , met Clifton two nights later  --  on the very night the " Brother Rat " episode was filmed without him  --  for a private deposition in Clifton 's room at the Sunset 400 Motel in Hollywood . ( Andy had checked in the night before to call Knoedelseder , as Clifton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clifton 's face had once again been shellacked by Ken Chase . And Knoedelseder found him in the dank , smoky motel room , where Sinatra music played and closed-circuit porn flickered on the television and skin magazines were splayed across the rumpled bed littered with empty whiskey bottles . ( Zmuda was supposed to have had two more hookers there but could n't persuade any to play along at the offering price . ) Then , after visiting for a while amid the grim detritus , Knoedelseder took Clifton to a bar across the street , where Clifton drank much Jack Daniel 's ( Knoedelseder tasted it to make sure it was the real thing ) while abusing the female bartender ; and then Clifton legitimately picked up a Hollywood waif who had wandered in , and , eventually , Knoedelseder deposited the lounge singer and the girl back at the motel and fled . When his Los Angeles Times piece , " The Identity Crises of Andy Kaufman , " ran two months later , there would be no mention of this night with Clifton , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one photograph of Clifton being thrown off the set . <p> And one week after the firing , on a flight to a college engagement in Albany , Zmuda let it slip to Andy that all of the actors at Taxi had been told early on that Andy was playing Clifton and were urged to just go along with it , and this news crushed him , and he felt betrayed and became enraged , and he called Linda Mitchell to scream , and then he called Shapiro , who calmed him somewhat before he could scream very much . And when he returned to Paramount a week later , Tony Danza brought in a projector to show the movies he had shot of Clifton 's final day , and everyone gathered in a room above the stage to watch . " And we 're laughing , you know , laughing at ourselves and at him and at the whole nightmare of it , " Danza recalled . " And then Andy walks in , and he stands there staring at the screen . And everybody sort of nervously takes this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are a few beats of silence afterward . Maybe too many beats . And then he clears his throat and says , ' Gee , who was that asshole ? ' And with that , he turns and leaves the room . End of story .
