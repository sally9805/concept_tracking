With a small front line as their foundation , the Nets are throwing off bigger opponents , and taking Photograph // There are center Jayson Williams wonders if he 's out of his mind trying to keep up with the league 's giants . One such night came in late November , when Williams , who is listed as 6-10-he actually is 6-9 ' ' /2-and 240 , gave away about six inches and 50 pounds when he matched up with Portland 's Arvydas Sabonis . After the game , Williams staggered off the court looking as if he had been hit by a Winnebago . " He must be about 7-foot-5 ( he 's listed at 7-3 ) , and his head alone weighs about 90 pounds , " Williams says , still wincing as he recalls the encounter . " There are games like that where you just get so exhausted . " But I 'd rather be dead tired and win 50 games and sit in the pool all summer , than not be tired and only win 30 games . " If the Nets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horn and Kendall Gill can survive defensively the way they have in the first half of the season , Williams will find a postseason trip cutting into some of his offseason free time . Although the trio of Davids has taken a few lickings against some Goliaths , the three have won more battles than they have lost and are a major reason New Jersey is on the rise , having ended last week at 20-17 with an eye on second place in the Atlantic . Williams has been bodying up against bigger centers so well that not only is he vying for the league lead in rebounding , he is often outscoring his taller opponents . Van Horn , 6-10 , matches up in height against most opponents at power forward , but at a lanky 220 pounds , he does n't match up in strength . Still , he is such an offensive talent that he , too , routinely outscores-and sometimes outrebounds-his man . Kendall Gill , 6-5 , somehow is finding a way to succeed at small forward after spending his pre-Nets career as a shooting guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnesota , Gill 's head barely reached the " Timberwolves " script on 6-11 Kevin Garnett 's uniform . But after their meeting , Gill walked off the court having won the scoring battle , 20-14 . Last week in a meeting with Charlotte , Gill helped hold 6-8 Glen Rice scoreless in the second half . What makes this frontcourt particularly noteworthy is the Nets are n't merely trying to survive with a patchwork lineup . Flying in the face of traditional thinking , coach John Calipari is bold enough to say that all three players are playing their proper NBA positions . " People are looking at a guy 's stature when what you have to look at is heart How big do they play ? " Calipari says emphatically . " I want killers . If you have killers , you win , no matter what their size . " Sounds awfully collegiate , does n't it ? Well , remember that it has been less than two years since Calipari left the University of Massachusetts to bring his missionary zeal to the NBA . And now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gill , Williams , starting guards Kerry Kittles and Sam Cassell and sixth man Chris Gatling ) , Calipari has grand dreams that this core can someday become a contender Before anybody starts laughing , remember that if not for a rugged schedule ( a dozen pairs of back-toback games in the first half ) and for injuries that have caused Van Horn , Gatling and Kittles to miss more than 40 games combined , the Nets might be recognized as the league 's biggest surprise . How can this front line that even Calipari admits is " undersized " possibly hold up in a giant-loving league ? Off to the front On defense , the biggest reason the Nets are able to succeed is they front the post extensively . The team 's rationale is that a conventional approach ( positioning a defender between his opponent and the basket ) often plays into the hands of teams with quality big men . The Nets say , " Why allow them to get the ball at all ? Let 's deny the entry pass . " So Williams , Van Horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lane , but on racing around bigger players . The fronting strategy is similar to the one that former SuperSonics assistant Bob Kloppenburg developed in Seattle in the late ' ' 80s-so much so that Kloppenburg , now an assistant in Toronto , says he feels flattered when he watches film of the Nets . If the three front effectively , they prevent any incoming passes from being sent to the post That 's important , because many teams set up their perimeter game by working the ball inside first . It helps that point guard Cassell brings a solid knowledge of defense from his three seasons in Houston and that Kittles is a gifted defender . The Nets are among the league leaders in steals because Gill , Cassell and Kittles all have the instincts to reach out a hand at the proper time against a harried ballhandler who 's looking to pass . But if this defense is so great , some may say , then why is n't everybody using it ? Partly because if you have a shotblocking center such as Dikembe Mutombo or Hakeem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Nets can offer no such obstacle . For the team 's plan to work , every player involved has to be extremely athletic , extremely hard-working-or both . Van Horn is the former , Williams and chief backup Michael Cage are the latter , and Gill qualifies as both . And it does n't hurt that Gill and Cage played Kloppenburg 's system in Seattle . " Kendall is a hard-nosed player who takes a lot of pride in his defense . It showed , " Garnett says of his recent battle with Gill . " And I think him being undersized just motivates him to play even harder . " Calipari says the fronting scheme is so exhausting that he would prefer to play his starters no more than 32 to 34 minutes per game . Last week , Gill was averaging 36 and Van Horn 39 . For Williams ( 36 ) , the system is especially taxing because he is relied upon heavily on the defensive boards . After fronting , Williams often will be further from the basket than the other center and must cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Nets , then , find it necessary to limit the number of halfcourt possessions an opponent has . They do that by mixing in a variety of traps and other pressure schemes that produce turnovers or at least help increase the tempo . The Nets have been prevented from installing too many variations in the season 's first half because the players are n't completely familiar with each other , but watch for the alternatives to increase . Run , do n't walk All the hard-working defense in the world wo n't do much good , though , if these same undersized players ca n't score on the other end . How do the Nets survive going up against bigger defenders ? First , by trying to cut down on the number of walk-it-up possessions . " If we get stuck in a mushmouth game , we 're dead , " Calipari says . The Nets want to get out on the break after every defensive rebound or basket , and their personnel fits the philosophy . At the point , Cassell loves to run the floor and has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitties , Gill and Gatling . Cassell is particularly good at finding Kittles on the break and has quickly grasped where and when scoring machine Van Horn needs the ball . With five players who are capable of scoring 20-plus points in a game and another-Williams-who usually is in double figures , it 's difficult on most nights for opponents to shut down all the scoring options . Of course , defenses are n't going to allow the Nets to run free all the time . When the game gets down to halfcourt sets , though , the Nets still can be dangerous because virtually all of their players can create their own shot . You might think a small team would n't get fouled often because defenders seemingly have an advantage , but the Nets rank second in the league in free-throw attempts . When shots do n't fall , there 's always Williams , who is leading the league in offensive rebounding with a staggering 6.8 average . " He has no peer , " Calipari says . " None . " Ignoring the numbers Calipari is serious about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care what anybody says . Jayson ts a ' ' 5 , ' " he says . " He 's undersized , but he is a 5 . He 'd get more beat up as a ' ' 4 , ' because those guys are just as strong and more talented . " And I 'm convinced Kendall is a ' ' 3 . ' Is he an undersized 3 ? Yes . But he does what 3 's do . " And Keith ? People say , Why do n't you play him at the 3 ? ' Because 3 's might outquick him and confuse him . No 4 's in the league can do that to him . And Keith can score in the post-like a 4 . " This infatuation with a small frontcourt is nothing new for Calipari . He built his reputation at UMass on winning games with undersized players . As Calipari points out , the Minutemen used 6-3 Will Herndon at power forward in 1991-92 and won 30 games . Calipari admits he has never coached a team with a true centerother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under several coaches . " I 'm just not comfortable coaching that way , " he says . Worth the wait ? The small lineup should enable the Nets to make the playoffs this season , but even Calipari does n't guarantee his system will work forever Gill is happy playing small forward , because the team is winning and because the move has helped rejuvenate his career . But he still thinks of himself as a shooting guard , and he could become more vocal in that opinion if the team does n't reach the playoffs . Van Horn does n't really know yet what his best position is and so he is willing to play wherever the coaching staff tells him . Williams , like his coach , believes he 's a center , but he says Gill and Van Horn are out of position . Still , there is none of the player dissension that disrupted the team in the first half last season . And Calipari is adamant about keeping this nucleus together for three years to see how the chemistry develops , despite rumors the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for a bigger center in the offseason , but only because it would give him more flexibility . " Why would I make a move until this team gets healthy , and I see who we really are ? " Calipari says . And let me ask you this : What center out there could we get who is better than what we have ? And why would somebody , knowing how hard centers are to get , take a small forward or a guard for a center who can play ? " When Calipari joined the franchise in June 1996 , he proudly proclaimed , " I 'm betting on me . " Now , he 's betting on Van Horn , Williams , Kittles , Gill , Cassell and Gatling , too . At least for this season , that 's a pretty good bet . Photograph GIANT TASK : The Nets ' ftrhg scheme can be exhausting , but so far Williams is holding up well .
