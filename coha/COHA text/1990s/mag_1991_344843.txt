The Bigger They Are , The Harder They Fall Pathological narcissism is on the rise , says Harvard Medical School psychologist STEVEN BERGLAS . Just when certain people seem to have it all , their kingdoms come crashing down . Berglas believes they are often victims of a syndrome that a bigger bank account wo n't ever cure . <P> Q. You 've been studying and treating rich and successful people for nearly a decade . What have you discovered ? <P> A. Individuals who suffer from success have what I call the four A 's  --  arrogance , a sense of aloneness , the need to seek adventure and adultery . These are the core attributes of people who achieve stellar successes without the psychological bedrock to prevent disorder . All my patients and the individuals I 've studied suffer from at least three out of four of these patterns . <P> Q. Can one be a healthy narcissist ? <P> A. Yes , there can be authentically healthy levels of narcissism , and that 's a goal of therapy . But the groups I 'm dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They marshal resources and legions of loyal people , and they are very influential . But they carry in them a germ seed , or they are affected by their success in a manner such that they ultimately implode . They get to a point in life beyond which they ca n't go further . I 've written much about this problem in a book called The Success Syndrome . <P> Q. Some components of this syndrome seem to turn up in many well-known people . <P> A. There are countless examples . The sense of arrogance can be Donald Trump saying his bankers were tossing money at him or John Gutfreund 's Salomon Brothers cornering the treasury-bill market illegally and failing to report it . It can be Leona ( " Only the little people pay taxes " ) Helmsley and her bragging to a little person who is going to be her undoing . The sense of aloneness is born of a mistrust of underlings , which can approach Howard Hughes ' isolationism . The adventure-seeking behavior can be insider trader Dennis Levine plotting to dupe SEC regulators with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imelda Marcos , Jimmy Swaggart , Jim Bakker , Ivan Boesky , Michael Milken : they all seem to have committed self-destructive acts that follow on the heels of enormous success . I have never met or treated any of them , but they do fit a prototype that I 've derived from both research and clinical case studies . <P> Q. Can all four A 's turn up in one person ? <P> A. " Hitting a quad " in my practice is as rare as winning the daily double at Aqueduct . The televangelists have , and they appear the most pathological of all . <P> Q. Ca n't one be happily successful and also be arrogant at times ? And studies show that most married people commit adultery . <P> A. Of course . We 're not talking about the need for purity . We all have clay feet . We fall from grace . But it 's so easy to have an extramarital affair without getting caught . Context is everything . Why , right after the big success , do they start doing it ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Hart , are ragingly self-destructive . <P> Q. Is this pathology particularly modern or American ? <P> A. How many people can name a single one of last year 's Nobel Prize winners ? In America we define status by financial success . It 's much easier to sacrifice family for career , and our culture reinforces that .
