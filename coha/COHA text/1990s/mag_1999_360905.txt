Whether you 're a fan of his work or consider him a little too gauche , you ca n't deny that Bill Gates likes to use broad brush strokes . Business @ the Speed of Thought is full of them : How he turned Microsoft around like a supertanker on a dime and pointed it toward the Internet in late 1995 . How a plague of paper records at his Redmond , Wash. , headquarters was all but eradicated under his guidance . And so on . But the boldest , broadest stroke of all is this : at a time when the Justice Department appears likely to pop the software Goliath one on the chin , Gates studiously manages to keep mum on the ongoing antitrust trial . Not one peep of anger , frustration or resignation is allowed to pass his literary lips . <P> Doubtless this is simply practical professionalism from the world 's richest executive , a man with an almost Clinton-like ability to compartmentalize . Still , it leaves us in a quandary . When we last saw Bill Gates , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrogant . He followed each question with a lengthy silence , denied knowledge of e-mails he had written and professed not to understand words like " market share , " " concerned " or " ask . " He was , in other words , one of the most potent weapons in the government 's armory . <P> Now Bill the tousle-haired billionaire is back , bursting with business advice and all the exuberance of a boy genius . Sun , Apple , IBM and Intel are merely examples of companies that use digital nervous systems . You 'd never guess they also play a major part in the feds ' case . " Trial " to this Gates means nothing more than putting a new software product through its paces . <P> What is the world to think of this Jekyll-and-Hyde performance ? Take , for example , the sage advice from Gates the author , who exhorts us to appreciate less-than-salutary tidings . " I have a natural instinct for hunting down grim news , " he writes . " If it 's out there , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me have figured this out . " <P> Such diktats , however , do not seem to apply to the DOJ suit , potentially the grimmest piece of news Microsoft has received in its 24-year existence . " This antitrust thing will blow over , " a lackadaisical Gates told Intel executives back in 1995 . When the government 's complaint finally hit his desk in 1998 , according to his own testimony , the software titan refused to read a word of it . Given the chance to reassess his videotaped Q. and A. in the light of its disastrous courtroom debut , CEO Gates conceded only that he should have " smiled a bit . " As Gates the author would have told him : " A CEO avoiding bad news is the beginning of the end . "
