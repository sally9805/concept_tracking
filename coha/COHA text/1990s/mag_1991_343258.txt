Museums live by getting . They risk stagnating when the flow of works of art into their permanent collections dries up . Which was just what the art-market boom of the 1980s threatened , by sending prices of certain categories of art  --  in particular , Impressionism and early Modernism  --  beyond their reach . Hence the fierce , if discreet , competition for big donors among big American museums . <P> It has been made more acute in the past few years by two factors . First , the shortening supply of American collections that actually contain the kind of things a great museum would want to have . ( The 1980s produced shoals of zillionaires but few connoisseurs . ) And second , a fashion among the rich for making their own " vanity " museums , a practice whose reductio ad absurdum was reached by places like the Terra Museum of American Art in Chicago and the Armand Hammer Museum in Los Angeles  --  a $100 million shell with maybe six paintings of quality inside it . <P> Few collectors have been courted more assiduously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triangle Publications and Richard Nixon 's onetime ambassador to Britain . Over the years , Annenberg had assembled a choice group of some 50 Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings , for which  --  only a year ago , at the peak of the now badly deflated art market  --  he turned down an offer of $1 billion from a Japanese syndicate . <P> Over the past year or so , Annenberg 's paintings went on tour to a number of U.S. museums that hoped to get them and vied with one another in the lavishness of their installations : the Philadelphia Museum of Art , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , the National Gallery in Washington . The collection will go on temporary exhibit , starting June 4 , at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City . And last week Annenberg announced that its landing there would become permanent : he had bequeathed his collection en bloc to the Met . At this news , the muted gnashing of directorial dentures was heard from coast to coast . " This is one of the largest single gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful director , Philippe de Montebello . " It is a series of really magnificent works . " <P> For his part , Annenberg ( whose flagship magazine was TV Guide ) said he had toyed with the idea of turning his home in Rancho Mirage , Calif. , into a " private little museum , " but had decided to place the collection in a wider context . " There are only two complete museums in the world , the Louvre and the Met . My judgment was that the Met was probably the best protection I would get . It was a matter of continuity . " <P> The Annenberg paintings will mesh very well with the Met 's holdings of 19th and early 20th century art , their foundations laid by the massive Havemeyer bequest of 1929 and reinforced by legacies from Stephen Clark , Sam Lewisohn and Robert Lehman . Annenberg 's paintings include several Cezannes , most conspicuously the great 1902-06 panorama of Mont Sainte-Victoire , so different from the Met 's more constricted version of the same subject . The collection includes works by Gauguin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of Monets from the 1870s  --  a phase of the master 's work not well represented at the Met until now .
