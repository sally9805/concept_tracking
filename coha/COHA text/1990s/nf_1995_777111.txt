" I Was Kind of a Sissy " : // In Search of Self , 1884-1906 // I // " Mr. President , was you popular when you was a boy ? " // " Why , no , I was never popular , " the old man told the crowd of school children in the Truman Library auditorium . " The popular boys were the ones who were good at games and had big , tight fists . I was never like that . Without my glasses I was blind as a bat , and to tell the truth , I was kind of a sissy . If there was any danger of getting into a fight , I always ran . I guess that 's why I 'm here today . " // It was one of Harry Truman 's rare moments of candor about his childhood . A man who gloried in a public roles as a gutsy , bourbon-drinking , poker-playing , frank-speaking fighter , he admitted , if just for an instant , that his difficulties in life had gone beyond hard election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay years of struggle to become the sort of man who would win the respect of his peers and , above all , that of his father . The tension of becoming something he was n't strengthened him in many ways , but it also left scars : an inordinate touchiness , a quick temper , and an insatiable demand for a recognition that stayed with him throughout his life . // Much of the story of Truman 's life consists of alternating episodes of struggle and accommodation  --  to his physical limitations and to the rapidly changing social and economic conditions of twentieth-century America . Such was the fate of many of children and grandchildren of the American frontier . // II // America was a land of democracy , individualism , and opportunity in 1846 when Anderson Shipped Truman and his bride settled near Westport Landing , Missouri , not too far from another couple they had known back in Kentucky , Solomon and Harriet Louisa Young . Everyone was , in theory , equal ; everyone had a chance in life . A vast , sparsely settled land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiative and hardihood to claim them . The Trumans and the Youngs displayed both qualities . // Anderson Truman and his wife , Mary Jane Holmes , were of the yeoman gentry of the upper South . Their parents had been part of the early wave of settlement from Virginia to the dark and bloody ground of Kentucky in the early days of the republic . The Trumans and Holmeses had fought Indians , staked out lands , raised crops , acquired a few slaves , and prospered . Thus , went the prevalent assumption , might any ambitious young couple willing to move west over trails blazed by the Indian traders , risk the scalping knife , and work hard at carving out for the themselves a small slice of the nation 's destiny . // The Trumans could be all the more assured of success with a bit of help from well-to-do parents and in-laws . Anderson Truman purchased 200 acres of prime farmland ; his mother-in-law , Nancy Tyler Holmes , gave the newlyweds some slaves as a wedding gift . The couple lived in comfortable prosperity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . They raised five children ; the third , John Anderson , was born in 1851 . In 1853 , the family moved just north of the Misouri River to a farm in Platte County , a quiet Kentucky-like area with a plantation culture . There they lived for the next thirteen years . // In the same Kentucky that produced the Trumans , Sol Young , an orphan at the age of twelve , had made his way in the world . Twenty-three years old in 1838 , he married nineteen-year-old Harriet Louisa Gregg , herself an orphan at ten . It is unclear whether Young benefited from an inheritance or made himself a man of means solely through muscle and ambition . It is indisputable that both he and his new wife possessed the limitless energy and self-reliance of archetypical American pioneers . // In 1841 , the Youngs sold 800 acres that Sol had accumulate on the Little Bullskin River and , with their two children , took a steamboat down the Ohio , up the Mississippi , and westward on the broad Missouri . Just south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north , they settled near the jumping-off point for the great West at the confluence of the Missouri , Kansas , and Blue rivers in Jackson County . // Sol restlessly acquired and sold large tracts of land . He also hauled freight and led cattle drives west . Spending three years raising cattle in California , he acquired a Spanish land grant that purportedly included much of the present city of Sacramento ; ultimately , he disposed of it for $75,000 . He missed some main chances but cashed in on others . Louisa stayed at home , bore seven more children , ran the farm , and balked only at joining him in the West . By 1861 , he was back in Missouri , a prosperous farmer and businessman who owned 1,300 acres . // During the Civil War , the Trumans and the Youngs sympathized with the South , more our of ties of kinship and culture than personal economic considerations . Both families suffered in the nasty guerrilla warfare along the Missouri-Kansas border . In 1861 , Louisa was tending the farm by herself during one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane and his Redlegs raided the property , made her cook biscuits for them until her hands blistered , slaughtered the hogs for their own use , shot the chickens , burned the barns , and stole her silver . They repeatedly hanged her son Harrison , a boy of thirteen , by the neck , nearly strangling him to death in an effort to make him admit that his father was in the Confederate Army . ( Actually , he was taking a load of freight across the Great Plains , but the eldest son , William , was a Confederate soldier . ) On four other occasions , Union troops confiscated the Youngs ' livestock and property . // In July 1862 , Young signed an oath of loyalty to the United States , but in August 1863 , his family still fell prey to Union Order No. 11 , which mandated the internment of all Confederate sympathizers in Jackson and tow and a half other counties . Sol was away again ; Louisa and the six children still at home loaded as much as they could in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whatever the Union irregulars did not loot went up in flames . Louisa and her children spent the next few months confined to a federal " post " and then made their way to Platte County , where they spent the duration of the war . For the rest of their lives , they harbored an unquenchable hatred for Abraham Lincoln , blue uniforms , and Kansans. // A quarter-century later , after Congress has passed a law permitting loyal citizens to request compensation for Civil War losses , Sol and Louisa filed for $21,442 . The claim itemized the confiscation of 224 head of livestock , 1,500 bushels of corn , 43,000 fence rails , 1,200 pounds of bacon , 7 wagons , and a " house used for guardhouse . " It remained unsettled at Sol 's death , unpaid at Harriet 's . Their heirs and attorneys would finally divide just $3,800. // The Trumans were luckier . At the beginning of the war , they took their few slaves to Kansas and set them free . Their farm was relatively unmolested .

His family also lived in fear of the Redlegs and once spent a cold autumn night hiding from them in a cornfield . // III // In all , the Youngs and the Trumans escaped the war relatively unscathed . The Trumans moved back to Jackson County and established themselve on 200 acres near Hickman 's Mills . Mary Jane died in 1879 . Anderson 's oldest son , William , had gone off on his own , but John stayed to help run the farm . The Youngs acquired nearly 400 acres a few miles away , outside the town of Grandview . Sol registered the property in Louisa 's name , built a big house on it , and made last trip west around 1870 . He continued to buy and sell lan actively ; by the end of 1869 , he and Louisa held over 2,200 acres . // Both families were prominent . Both were Baptists , the Trumans vehemently so . It must have seemed a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married Sol 's eighth child , Martha Ellen . The newlyweds moved to the town of Lamar , about 100 miles south . For $685 John bought a large lot with a small frame house and a big barn ; he went into business as a livestock trader . Anderson sold his farm and moved in with them . // John Truman was thirty years old when he married , left his father 's farm , and started out on his own . He was a bantam of a man , about five feet , four inches tall . As his children told it long after his death , he was a gentle father who seldom spoke a harsh word to them , had a soft voice , loved music , and sang as he worked . He also groped after the success his father and father-in-law had achieved but became bitter as he eventually found it out of reach in the more settled world of the late nineteenth century . One Lamar old-timer remembered him as a hot-tempered little man with a high-pitched voice who spoke in what some local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a culture in which it was relatively common for men to come to blows over differences , John Truman never hesitated to resolve disputes with his fists . Once , after he had moved his family to Independence , he was testifying in a lawsuit when the lawyer for the opposition called him a liar . He jumped from the witness stand , fists flying , and chased the attorney , a six-footer who weighed well over 200 pounds , into the street . After a while , he returned alone . " Did you get him , John ? " asked the judge . " No , he got away . " The response from the bench indicated how close western Missouri still was to the frontier : " Too bad . That fellow really had a good beating coming to him . " // A shrewd , persuasive trader , John managed to walk the fine line between good salesmanship and outright crookedness . His honesty won wide recognition , but as his elder son put it , after he closed a deal , " the other fellow was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trader and speculator , he strove to get ahead much as his elders had , through a combination of hard work and risky enterprise . // His bride was tow inches taller than he and at twenty-nine years old had been an old maid in the eyes of her relative an acquaintances . An alumna of Central Female College in Lexington , Missouri , where she had studied art , music , and literature , Martha Young Truman was a talented amateur artist , a devote of the piano , and a lover of English literature who never lost her admiration for Alexander Pope . Like many rural and small-town wives , she had a considerably better education than her husband and saw the transmission of learning and culture to her offspring as one of the duties of motherhood . She also was a fun-loving woman who called herself a lightfoot Baptist because she ignore condemnations of social dancing and enjoyed a good party . But she was not a frail , over-cultured female unsuited to a tough environment . Very much the daughter of her strong pioneer mother , Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and usually got her own way . She handled a 16-gauge shotgun as well as most men . Independent , opinionated , and assertive , she was as tough as a barrel of roofing nails . // John and Martha lived in Lamar for about three years . Her first pregnancy resulted in a stillbirth . The second was successful . On May 8 , 1884 , she bore a healthy baby boy . It was symptomatic of her ability to have her way that they named him Harry for her brother Harrison and gave him the middle initial " S. , " which could be represented as abbreviating her father 's first name or her father-in-law 's seldom-used middle name. ( * ) // John Truman apparently found himself unable to make a good living on livestock trading alone . Two months before Harry 's first birthday , he sold the Lamar property for $1,600 . The family moved back north , briefly to Harisonville , and then to a farm near Belton in Cass County , a few miles from the Young and Truman homesteads across the Jackson County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave birth to a boy , John Vivian . The following year , they moved to Grandview to manage the Young farm . Anderson Truman died there a few months later . Harry , barely three , heard someone say " He 's gone , " came into the room , and tugged at the old man 's beard in an effort to awaken him . // The Grandview years were good for the Trumans . John not only managed the Young farm , but purchased 120 acres for himself , 40 of them from his father-in-law . On August 12 , 1889 , Martha gave birth to their third child , a daughter they named Mary Jane , after John 's mother . For Harry , surrounded by loving relatives , the time at Grandview was memorable . When Harry was six , old Sol , by then a white-haired man with a long bear , took him to the Cass County fair at Belton to watch the horse races from the judges ' box . Uncle Harrison , a muscular , six-foot bachelor , brought him and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vivian lived a Norman Rockwell childhood , romping through pastures and riding ponies , secure and innocent in a small , benign world . // Even in Arcadia , of course , all was not perfect . Harry occasionally learned the hard way . One day , while riding with his father , he fell off his Shetland pony . An angry John Truman snapped that any boy who could not stay on a pony at a walk ought to walk himself and made him return to the house leading the animal on foot . " Mamma thought I was badly mistreated , but I was n't , " he recalled seventy years later . " I spite of my crying all the way to the house , I learned a lesson . " // Harder lessons began to come at the age of five . Under his mother 's tutelage , Harry had begun to read , but the displayed difficulty with anything other than the large-type family Bible , which he eventually read twice in its entirety . A doctor diagnosed malformed eyeballs and prescribed thick , expensive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school three years later that Harry was fitted with them . But already he had been set apart . Suddenly , the little boy 's weak vision made many of the normal childhood activities that he had enjoyed seem hazardous . He helped in the kitchen . He attended to his baby sister , regularly fixing her hair and rocking her to sleep . ( " Mama , make Harry bye-o , " she would cry when she wanted attention . ) He spent more and more time reading . The adjustment would have been difficult enough in the secluded little environment in which he lived ; it no doubt became even more trying when the family made yet another move . // However good the years on the Young farm had been , John was a man with wider ambitions . Martha had bigger dreams also  --  for her children , especially Harry . The rural schools , she told her husband , were not good enough . They had to move to town so that Harry could get a first-class education , In 1890 , the family left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of 6,000 , ten miles east of the emerging metropolis of Kansas City , Independence promised opportunities to an ambitious speculator . Poised in midstage between a frontier past and a twentieth-century future , southern in its atmosphere , it was still vividly mindful of three separate Civil War battles . The veterans of Quantrill 's raiders , the most notorious of Missouri 's Confederate guerrillas , held annual reunions . Young Harry probably did not yet know that in 1873 the first husband of his Aunt Sallie , a rogue named James ( Jim Crow ) Chiles , had been killed in a gunfight with Deputy Marshall Jim Peacock on the courthouse square . The old outlaw Frank James lived a few miles away near Kearney and drew crowds of admirers on his infrequent visits to town . ( In 1902 , James 's former associate , Cole Younger , was released from the Minnesota state penitentiary ; he settled in nearby Lee 's Summit and supported himself by giving public lectures on the wages of sin. ) // Business centered around the courthouse square , bounded by posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied . In rainy weather , the dirt streets became avenues of mud , studded during the summer with discarded watermelon rinds . Most men wore boots with their trousers tucked into the tops ; many still carried knives or guns . Covered boardwalks lined the storefronts on all sides of the square . The saloons were perpetually busy . Fistfights were common , especially on election days , when the voters of each of the city 's four wards cast their ballots at different corners of the square . Nighttime holdups and burglaries were surprisingly frequent , many of them pulled off by blacks who disappeared into their districts of Kansas City . // When the Trumans moved to Independence , it had no water system , no paved streets or sidewalks , no electricity . Wood was the fuel commonly used for heating and cooking . A trip to Kansas City was an all-day experience in good weather , an impossibility in bad . The city showed a veneer of civilization  --  numerous churches , schools , a library , two newspapers , and a substantial educated class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For John Truman , who planned to concentrate on livestock trading , it was more akin to a move of the farm to town . // Truman purchased a big house with a white cupola on Crysler Street , not far from the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks . The neighborhood consisted of prosperous upper-middle-class homes , displaying those little touches of the extravagant characteristic of Gilded Age architecture . John bought two adjacent lots , fenced his property , probably built a barn or an animal shed , and conducted what appears to have been a thriving livestock business . He hired a black couple , Caroline Hunter and her husband , Letch Simpson , to do household work . Their children usually came along to do small chores or play with the Truman youngsters in the big yard . In keeping wit the attitude toward blacks that his family taught him , Harry would take time from his duties as president fifty years later to facilitate assistance for one of them who had fallen on hard times . // The family found a natural-gas deposit on the property and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of John Truman that he became embroiled in a lawsuit with the driller . It was probably in this case that he chased the attorney who insulted him into the street . ) When the gas ran out in 1895 , John traded the Crysler property for an equally big house with a huge lot on Waldo Street . In partnership with a man named Oscar Mindrup , he went into the real-estate and grocery businesses . An inventor who held at least two patents , he developed an idea for an automatic railroad switch , a device with substantial profit potential ; but when the demanded too high a royalty from interested railroads , they came up with an alternative . He also began to speculate profitably in commodity futures . // By the turn of the century , John 's livestock enterprise took him as far south as Texas . On at least one or two occasions in the 1890s , the entire family took train trips there to visit John 's older brother , William , who had moved to the Southwest in the early 1870s shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his son , Ralph , who was passed around from one family of Missouri Trumans to another until he joined the army during the Spanish-American War . He had a near-brotherly , and sometimes tempestuous , relationship with Harry that endured throughout their lives . // If the Trumans were a relatively cohesive family , the Youngs long had been at one another 's throats . When Sol Young died in 1892 without a will and leaving 1,520 acres of land , his children soon were bitterly disputing his estate . On one side were Harrison and Martha ; on the other , William and two sisters : Laura and Sallie . The groups traded accusations that the other had already received substantial " advancements " from Sol 's estate and thus should be disqualified from any further share . At this point , the Trumans were the only losers ; John had to deed the 80 acres he had acquired in 1889 to " the heirs of Solomon Young , " probably because Sol had held a mortgage on it or had otherwise financed it . In October 1894 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differential awards the court might choose to make . The Trumans realized 160 acres and $286 . The following year , they purchased another 40 acres from Harrison . // Sol 's widow must have watched with anger and despair . The owner of 398 acres in her own name , Louisa already had assented to accept a child 's share of the state , rather than the half interest to which she was entitled . In 1893 , after her home at Grandview had burned to the ground , she had moved into Independence to stay with the trumans while Harrison saw to the building of a new , considerably less pretentious farmhouse . It seems clear that she felt estranged from her other children . On March 30 , 1895 , she signed a last will and testament ; it provided $5 for each of them except the two that she felt were taking care of her , Harrison and martha . They were to receive all the rest of her property . John 's attorney , J. M. Callahan , witnessed and probably drafted the document . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisa in every way , for it meant an eventual half-ownership of the 518 acres of prime farmland that she possessed after the settlement of Solomon 's estate . For the Trumans , this prize must have seemed the future capstone of a life that was already prosperous . // For many Americans  --  workers in industrial towns and cities made jobless by a severe depression , farmers in the plains states and the South facing falling crop prices and foreclosure  --  the 1890s were desperate years , scarred politically by the Populist revolt and the bitter Bryan-McKinley presidential campaign of 1896 . But for much of the middle class living in well-kept houses on elm-lined streets , the decade was the Gay Nineties . The Truman family belonged to this group . As he moved through his forties , John Truman could count himself among the lucky . // When he was interested in something other than his business , it was usually politics . In the tradition of the Trumans and the Youngs , he was an intensely partisan Democrat whose whose attachment to his party went beyond ideological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he nailed a flag to the cupola of the Crysler house in celebration . He supported Bryan , Cleveland 's ideological antithesis , with equal enthusiasm in 1896 . In 1900 , he attended the Democratic National Convention , held in Kansas City , to cheer Bryan 's second nomination . He watched from the box of his host , prominent Kansas City banker William Kemper . Clearly , he had moved a few steps away from the ragged farmers and workers whom Bryan vainly attempted to unite , but it mattered little . The party allegiance that John Truman inherited from his father was not based on class conflict ; it was a product of the guerrilla warfare along the Missouri-Kansas border . He passed his faith along to his children , and they accepted it without question . // V // Harry 's early years in Independence produced some fond memories . The Truman house , with its big yard and farm animals , was a gathering place for neighborhood children . John Truman has a little wagon made for Harry and Vivian ; a leather worker named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goats ; and the children paraded around the neighborhood in the rig . Harry did his share of the chores , most of them farm work  --  milking he cows , herding them to pasture and back , currying the horses , taking the animals to a big public spring two blocks south for water , weeding the garden . He and Vivan sold newspapers for a time , not with a lot of business sense , he recalled : " We usually spent the capital and profit for ice cream sodas and the our father would have to finance us again but we had a lot of fun . " // In the fall of 1892 , fitted at last with thick eyeglasses , Harry began the first grade at the age of eight . The Independence school instructors taught basic reading , writing , and arithmetic in the no-nonsense preprogressive tradition . A handbook of rules and regulation issued in 1909 expressed the tone of the school during Harry 's years in it . Students were expected " to be punctual and regular in attendance ; obedient in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle and respectful in manner . " // Harry no doubt received strong injunctions from his mother to study hard and obey the teachers  --  most of them unmarried women and all with names that personified the small-town , Victorian Midwest : Miss Myra Ewin , Miss Minnie Ward , Miss Jennie Clements , Miss Mamie Dunn , Aunt Nannie Wallace . He was a good , earnest student , if far from brilliant , and probably a favorite among them . Years later , he recalled , probably accurately , that none of his teachers had been bad : " They gave us our high ideals , and they hardly ever received more than forty dollars a month for it . " He also remembered how at an early age he had learned the way to get ahead : " Whenever I entered a new school room I would watch the teacher and her attitude toward the pupils , study hard , and try to know my lesson better than anyone else . " // In January 1894 , both he and Vivian contracted diptheria . There was no known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , Harry claimed ( despite his fondness for bourbon ) still to hate the smell of both . Vivian recovered quickly . Harry lingered for months , his throat and right side paralyzed . On his tenth birthday , he was unable to walk and had to be moved about in a baby buggy . Soon afterward , he was well and never critically ill again for the next sixty years . Sent to summer school to make up for the half-year of second grade he had missed , he did so well that in the fall he was placed in the fourth grade , joining his own age group for the first time . // He enlarged his horizons in other ways . The town has a good public library with about 3,000 volumes ; he spent a lot of time there , browsing through encyclopedias and other works . He read avidly at home as well , mostly book checked out of the library but also some his mother bought for him . When he was ten , she gave him a four-volume set edited by Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully bound , lavishly illustrated collection of biographical articles from leading adult periodicals . The first volume , Soldiers and Sailors  --  with its sketches of such leaders as Alexander the Great , Hannibal , and Charles Martel  --  especially captured Harry 's imagination . // He also became a devoted reader of Mark Twain . A Missourian raised in a southern-style environment , a writer capable of dealing with a great themes in prose that a child could read , a commentator who addressed contemporary manners and morals with ironic , blunt , and pithy epigrams , Twain had a special appeal that endured through Harry Truman 's life . Both to the boy and to the mature man , Twain was the sort of figure that Benjamin Franklin had been to an earlier generation of Americans  --  an inspirational , practical philosopher who won adherents with elemental , easily remembered maxims . One that Harry learned early and frequently repeated as an adult was " Always do right . This will gratify some people and astonish the rest . " // For a few months , shortly after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open Clinton 's Drugstore on the town square , sweep the sidewalks , dust off the bottles on the shelves , crank the ice-cream freezer , and take care of a few early customers . His most lasting impressions came from church members and Anti-Saloon Leaguers who slipped in after breakfast every day for a 10-cent of whiskey . They initiated a lasting skepticism about " the public front of leading citizens and amen-corner-praying ' churchmen . " // As he remembered it twenty years or so later , Harry did not do much at Clinton 's : " I ate ice cream and candy and usually failed to show up when windows were to be washed . " But others recalled it differently . Long afterward , Mary Paxton Keeley remembered  --  or thought she remembered  --  her friend Bessie Wallace remarking that she wished Harry did not have to work so hard . Piled on top of piano lessons , chores at home , and school assignments , the job was too much for him . He was proud of the $3 a week he was making , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to quit the job and spend more time studying . // Independence High School offered only a three-year curriculum . Old-fashioned , solid , and not terribly different from the education that Franklin D. Roosevelt was receiving at Groton at about the same time , it emphasized the classics , rhetoric , logic , mathematics , natural science , history , and English literature . As a teenager , Harry read Cicero , Plutarch , Caesar , and Marcus Aurelius , learning and never forgetting the vices and virtues of the ancients . He emerged from the experience a truly educated man , short on vocational skills perhaps , but well grounded in the liberal arts . // One thing that his education did not provide  --  here also one senses a parallel to Groton  --  was a sense of complexity and relatively . Standards were clear , fixed , and simple . Harry 's schooling conspired with his moral and religious upbringing to leave him with the conviction that personal behavior , and by extension that of societies and nations , should be guided by universally understandable Victorian maxims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were few gray areas in life . As with Roosevelt 's education at Groton , moreover , Truman 's schooling embodied the Victorian assumption that the history of mankind was a story of progress ; thus it reinforced the pioneer optimism of his forebears . // It was equally consistent with his upbringing and his environment that he learned to interpret virtue in ways other than the heroic . At the age of fifteen , he wrote a short essay on courage . It began by quoting Emerson : " Behavior is the Mirror in which each man shows his image . " Then it defined the topic : " The virtue I call courage is not in always facing the foe but in taking care of those at home . Courage does not always come in battle but in home communities . " A man who cared for plague victims at the risk of his own life displayed courage . Robert Morris had demonstrated courage by pledging his fortune to the Americans Revolution . " A true heart , a strong mind , and a great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . " // Truman also enjoyed poetry . Tennyson was among his favorites . Several stanzas from " Lockesley Hall " affected him so deeply that he copied them and carried them with him for the next fifty years : // For I dipt into the future , far as human eye could see , // Saw the Vision of the world , and all the wonders that would be ; // Saw the heavens fill with commerce , argosies of magic sails , // Pilots of the purple twilight , dropping down with costly bails ; // Heard the heavens fill with shouting , and there rained a ghastly dew // From the nations ' airy navies grappling in the central blue ; // Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm , // With the standards of the people plunging thro the thunderstorm ; // Till the war-drum trobbed no longer , and the battle-flags were furl 'd // In the Parliament of Man , the Federation of the World . // There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal law . // The most indelible interest that he carried away from his school days was the study of history . Like many a bookish boy and very much in tune with his times , he developed a fascination with the exploits of great men , especially soldiers and political leaders . Cincinnatus , the Roman farmer-soldier , was a special hero ; so was Robert E. Lee . Unlike his mother , he eventually came to regard Lincoln as a great leader and the preservation of the Union as a good thing . But , no doubt with her encouragement , he developed a lifelong distaste for New England in all its political and cultural manifestations. // At some point , he developed a rough philosophy of history that emphasized personalities and assumed patterns . By current academic standards , his view of the historical process seems simple-minded ; in an age that read Plutarch and venerated Carlyle , it appeared very much the common sense of things . " I saw that it takes men to make history , or there would be no history , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make the man . " He came to believe that while history moved generally in the direction of progress , in the course of its ups and downs , it repeated itself . " What came about in Philadelphia in 1776 really had its beginning in Hebrew times , " he would assert in his memoirs . It followed that the leaders who made history move in the right direction were men who , drawing on the lessons of the past , avoided the mistakes of those who had preceded them  --  whether in investigating the conduct of a war , dealing with foreign aggressors , facing a modern-day witch-hunt , or handling an obstreperous general . // VI // His mother decided that Harry should learn to play the piano . When he was eleven , he began to take lessons from Miss Emma Burrus , whose family lived next door . He displayed remarkable aptitude ; after two or three years , he had learned all she could teach him . Martha then arranged for twice-a-week lessons in Kansas City with Mrs. E. C. White , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher of Ignacy Paderewski ) , Anton Rubinstein , and Josef Lhevinne . Sitting at an imposing Steinway in her big brick house at Twenty-seventh Street and Brooklyn Avenue , Harry played the works of Beethoven , Mozart , Chopin , and other greats . In 1990 , when Paderewski performed in Kansas City , Mrs. White took Harry backstage to meet the maestro and learn firsthand how to execute a difficult " turn " in one of his own compositions . // In his early teens , Harry seriously aspired to a career as concert pianist , rising every day at 5:00 A.M. for two hours of practice on the family 's Kimball upright before going off to school . Mrs. White considered him one of her most promising pupils . " She gave a recital once in a while and she always gave me a showy , brilliant piece to play , " he told a friend fifty years later . " The mothers of her other pupils always said she played favorites with the boys  --  maybe she did . " // It was not easy in turn-of-the-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Harry did , probably all the way through high school and afterward until he had neither the time nor the money to continue . Yet after he quit , he never looked back . " I through once I 'd be an ivory tickler , " he wrote to Bess Wallace in 1911 , " but I am glad my money ran out before I got too far . " Decades later , he simply said , " I was n't good enough . " ( In company he liked , he joked , " My choice early in life was either to be a piano player in a whorehouse or a politician  --  and to tell the truth there 's hardly a difference . " ) // He retained a lifelong love for classical music and enjoyed it openly when he was president . One senses nonetheless that his attraction to the piano as a career was always tentative . He wanted to please his mother and teacher and was happy to be recognized as the best at something . But he also wished to win the recognition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past with his music rolls . And he wanted most of all to emulate his father . By the time he was forced to abandon his lessons , he had a clear understanding that he could not achieve all these objectives as a pianist . He may already have possessed a dim awareness that he might attain them as a politician . // Harry Truman 's childhood was not that of a miserable outcast , but his thick eyeglasses amounted to a handicap of sorts in a youthful world where learning counted for less than athletic prowess . His malshaped eyeballs were not an obvious , crippling disability . Still , their impact is suggested by Truman 's private remark at the age of sixty-five that they were a " deformity " and by his belief that his parents might have found a specialist who could have corrected his vision through eye exercises . // Young Harry learned to get along . Following the orders of his eye doctor and mother , he never fought , ran away when he had to , and rarely , if ever , participated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he no doubt had learned very early from his egalitarian parents that it was wrong to flaunt his learning or to act superior . He naturally enough wanted to be liked and accepted , and he worked at it . Just as he tried to please his parents and teachers , he strove with some success to win over his playmates . " He just smiled his way along , " his first-grade teacher , Myra Ewin recalled fifty years later . // The lesson stayed with him : " Because of my efforts to get along with my associates , I usually was able to get what I wanted . It was successful on the farm , in school , in the Army , and particularly in the Senate . " What he perhaps did not fully understand , even as an old man , was the psychic cost of that mode of success . Having been taught the virtue of male aggressiveness and inner direction , as exemplified by his father , Truman found himself forced into a conciliatory , other-directed style of behavior that clashed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a few friends who must have been about as bookish as he  --  most notably Charlie Ross , the son of the local jailer , and Elmer Twyman , whose father was the family doctor . They studied Latin and literature together . Once they constructed a model of Caesar 's bridge across the Rhine . Charlie edited the first school yearbook , The Gleam , named for Tennyson 's " Follow the Gleam . " Harry worked on the staff . Soft-faced , bespectacled , physically underdeveloped , a bit pudgy , he was never a leader in any group . He developed something of a reputation as an arbiter of disputes that might have erupted into fistfights , and he occasionally umpired baseball games for the other boys . Yet for all his goodwill , he seems to have been forced to endure more than his share of teasing and name-calling. // " I was always afraid of the girls my age and older , " he remembered . The only exceptions seem to have been his sister , Mary Jane , and his first cousins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been rooted in his sense of inadequacy and his need to expend so much energy on getting along with boys . He dealt with it through a common defense mechanism , the impossible romance . In Sunday school at the age of five , he met a little girl with golden curls and beautiful blue eyes . He fell in love at once , he recalled . Astonishingly , his devotion , although not directly expressed to her and certainly not reciprocated , lasted through his school years and beyond . // That little girls , Bess Wallace , was from one of Independence 's best families . Her grandfather George P. Gates had moved to Missouri from Vermont after the Civil War , had co-founded a successful milling company , and had built a big gingerbread house at 219 North Delaware Street ( just across from a more modest structure that would be occupied by Harry 's cousins , the Nolands ) . Her father , David W. Wallace , was reputedly the handsomest man in town . Her mother , Madge Gates Wallace , had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pantry flour sacks . However egalitarian their ideals , the people of Independence understood social distinctions  --  and felt them all the more keenly because they were at variance with the prevailing democratic myth . Young Harry had to be aware that the Wallaces belonged to a class apart . The Wallaces were established and moneyed ; the Trumans were a new family of uncertain and insecure fortune . The Wallaces were Presbyterian and Episcopalian ; the Trumans were Baptists. // Bess herself was attractive , intelligent , high-spirited , and athletic . She could play tennis , baseball , and the new sport of basketball better than Harry . His admiration for her must have been clear enough , but there is no indication that during their school days their relationship went beyond occasional walks home with Harry carrying her books . In high school , they frequently studied Latin together with the Noland sisters . But at social gathering in which boys and girls paired up , Harry usually escorted his cousin Ethel , whom he credited with teaching him " how to be polite . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because so much socializing was organized around church membership , Harry and Bess were probably only seldom at the same occasions . It is doubtful , moreover , that she took him any more seriously than did his male friends . A smart boy and nice enough , she probably felt , but not the one she would marry . Chances are that Harry understood her feelings perfectly , even as he cultivated his infatuation . // Harry 's relationship with his father and brother must have gnawed at his self-esteem . Perhaps because he sensed from the beginning that Harry was his mother 's favorite , Vivian became his father 's boy . He was not interested in schooling , refused to take piano lessons , and liked the outdoors . Avidly adopting his father 's interest in livestock trading , he practically became a junior partner . By the time he was twelve , Vivian had his own checkbook and was trading on his own account . Harry must have sensed that while his father treated him decently , he did not have a full measure of paternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of his first week at Clinton 's Drugstore , he actually tried to give his earnings to his father ; no doubt he was disappointed when told to save the money for himself . // Sometime during his high-school years , Harry tried to change his image . He brought fencing foils along to his Latin study sessions with the Noland sisters and Bess . During study breaks , the adolescents played at the sport on the porch . ( One need not be a hard-core Freudian to discern a certain significance here . ) Ethel and Nellie gave him the nickname Horatio , after Hamlet 's decisive friend , and he gloried in it . After the beginning of the Spanish-American War in the summer of 1898 , the neighborhood youngsters , like children all over the country , formed a drill company . They marched through the streets , camped out in the woods just north of town , elected new officers every day , and occasionally shot stray chickens with their .22 rifles . Harry began to dream about becoming a professional soldier . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , Fielding Houchens , tried to prepare for the military academies . They took special tutorials in history and geography with one of their teachers , Miss Maggie Phelps . Harry had his heart set on West Point . He gave up shortly after his graduation , when he went to the Army Recruiting Station in Kansas City and discovered that his eyesight disqualified him for a regular army commission . The experience was yet another  --  probably not unexpected  --  disappointment . ( Houchens made it to the Naval Academy , only to flunk out. ) // Harry Truman , Fielding Houchens , Charlie Ross , and Elmer Twyman were four of only eleven boys who graduated along with thirty girls in the Independence High School class of 1901 . They all posed as a group , dressed in their Sunday best , on the front steps of the school for the class picture . Charlie , the valedictorian , sat at one end of the front row . Harry stood inconspicuously near the middle of the back row . A very pretty Bess Wallace displayed her most fetching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school door bore the legend " Juventus Spes Mundi " : " Youth , the Hope of the World . " // VII // John Truman was worth #30,000 or $40,000 and looked to a future without limit . Harry felt no sense of urgency about getting a job . He took a short trip to Murphysboro , Illinois , where he visited with his Aunt Ada and her family . On the way back , he stopped in St. Louis to see relatives there . They took him to the races , where he bet $5 on a long shot named Claude , a fine mud horse who ran poorly on dry tracks . A rainstorm blew in just before post time , Claude won going away , and Harry collected $125 . Like his father , he was attracted to long shots ; his initial experience with one was encouraging . In September , he and Cousin Ralph , recently discharged from the army , went down to Texas for a visit with Ralph 's father . They traveled like hobos , grabbing rides on freight cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough , toughened by military life . In Dallas , Harry trailed along while Ralph and an acquaintance did the town . Whatever the activity , seventeen-year-old Harry did not participate . Years later , he wrote to Ralph , " I was damn fool about that time . If it had been a year or two later I 'd had as good a time as you did . It do n't take a fellow long to learn in the National Guard . " // In the fall of 1901 , Charlie Ross and Elmer Twyman went off to the University of Missouri . It appears that the Trumans could have afforded to send Harry to Columbia with them , although his father may have already begun to have cash problems . In those days , a university education did not seem essential for a bright young man , and Harry seems to have wanted to continue his Kansas City-based piano lessons . He enrolled in Spalding 's Commercial College in downtown Kansas City , learning typing in the summer and " debit and credit and Pittman shorthand " during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , would leave him with an understanding of the rudiments of bookkeeping ; but he rarely used a typewriter and many never have employed whatever shorthand he acquired . He typically left home early in the morning with trolley fare and a quarter for lunch , attended his classes , had a piano lesson with Mrs. White ( probably twice a week ) , and returned in the afternoon . Occasionally , he had an ice-cream soda at a downtown shop run by Jesse James , Jr . // Harry quit Spalding after only one semester and began to work with his father and Vivian in the family business , most likely keeping the books while the other two did the trading . He may have left business school as quickly as he did because the family was already experiencing financial difficulties . ( In March 1902 , they raised money by selling the 160 acres that Sol Young had left Martha . ) His father was making large  --  and disastrous  --  commitments to grain-futures contracts . By midsummer 1902 , the family 's losses were massive and irreversible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset . Harry and his father took the train down to Thayer , just a mile or so from the Arkansas line , to inspect forty acres of land that John had acquired sight unseen . Renting a buggy and team of horses , they took a twisting road some eight miles along the Eleven Point River , which was raging along at flood stage . At what must have been considerable risk , they forded the river thirteen times . As Harry remembered it fifty years later , the property ran up the side of a mountain and " was more perpendicular than horizontal . " // After John Truman returned to Independence , he sold the livestock , the remaining forty acres near Grandview , and , in September 1902 , the big house on Waldo Street . The family rented a residence at 902 North Liberty Street , but stayed there for only a few months . In April 1903 , they moved to Kansas City , purchasing a two-story house at 2108 Park Avenue . The neighborhood immediately to the south was a respectable one with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John still liked to think of himself as a livestock dealer , but he had to settle for a job as night watchman . Still a tough , feisty man , he seems never to have recovered his self-confidence . The reversal at a critical stage of Harry 's life . He would spend much of his young adulthood seeking the sort of business success that had eluded his father and would become increasingly touchy about any disparagement of his family . // VIII // " It took all I received to help pay family expenses and keep my brother and sister in school , " Truman recalled of those hard times . In August 1902 , he took a mailroom job for $7 a week at the Kansas City Star . Two weeks later , he found better-paying work . His bookkeeping class and good reputation landed him the position of timekeeper for the L.J . Smith Company , a railroad construction firm doing a project for the Santa Fe line . The pay was $35 a month and board . Because John had not yet gotten his night watchman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only regular income at that time . // Driving a hand-propelled " tricycle car , " Harry , just eighteen , moved between three construction camps about five miles apart and recorded job attendance for each member of the crew . A few of the workmen were farmers using their teams and wagons to make some extra money ; others were semiskilled specialists such as blacksmiths and cooks . The manual laborers were hobos who worked a ten-hour day for 15 cents an hour . Every two weeks , Harry paid them off in some saloon ; most of them promptly spent every penny on a weekend drunk . Eating and living in the camps , he discovered what alcohol could do to men and learned , he recalled , " all the cuss words in the English language , not by ear , but by note . " He remembered with pride a foreman 's assessment of him : " He 's all right from his asshole out in every direction . " // The construction project concluded toward the end of February 1903 . Harry spent the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisting in his parent 's move to Kansas City . Shortly before his nineteenth birthday , the National Bank of Commerce hired him as a clerk at $35 a month . That June , after leaving high school ( he seems never to have graduated ) , Vivian also got a job at Commerce , at $15 a month . // In his later years , Harry had nothing but bad memories of the bank and its management , remembering especially the way in which the vice president in charge of personnel , C.H. Moore , delighted in dressing down clerks who made mistakes . But Moore never had much cause for complaint with Harry , who after six months was put in charge of the bank 's filing vault . The job was an important one . The reports from A.D. Flintom , an intermediate supervisor , were uniformly glowing : // October 13 , 1903 // Is an excellent boy  --  does his work well  --  is king and obliging .... // Habits and appearance good . // April 14 , 1904 // He is an exceptionally bright young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vault better than it has ever been kept .... almost always here and // tries hard to please everybody . We never had a boy in the vault like him // before . // Vivian did not fare so well . Paid a miserable salary and given routine work in an environment alien to his temperament , he periodically rebelled . A few months after starting , he demanded a salary increase and stalked out of the bank when refused . Two days later  --  no doubt after being told by his mother , his father , and possibly Harry that the family had to settle for what it could get  --  he returned and was reinstated . Flintom judiciously evaluated the younger boy : // He writes a miserable hand , but is a good worker and a good collector . // His appearance is good and he is seldom absent from duty and his habits // are also good . He appears to be without ambition .... At times he is anxious // to work ... and at other times he will sulk .... I do n't think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk . // After two years , Harry had managed a raise to $40 a month . " If a man got an additional five dollars on his monthly pay , he was a go-getter , " Truman recalled forty years later , " because he had out-talked the bawler-out and had taken something from the tightest-was bank president on record . " In March 1905 , his parents , with whom he and Vivian continued to live , traded their house in Kansas City for eighty acres near Clinton , Missouri . Both Harry and Vivian quit their jobs , helped with the move , and may have expected to stay and help run the new farm . By the beginning of April , however , they were back at Commerce Bank , applying for and receiving their old jobs . // Neither stayed long . After six weeks , Harry quit to take a similar job at Union National Bank . As he recalled it , the starting pay was $60 a month , and he soon had won a raise to $100 a month , very good money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vivian left for a job at the First National Bank . Harry recalled the supervisors on his new job as kind and sympathetic . He made friends easily ; on occasion , he would take some of them out to his grandmother 's farm for a country dinner followed by a horseback tour of the property . // IX // Harry found it good life . Kansas City was a rough , rollicking , wide-open river town , but it seems unlikely that he sampled its opportunities for sin . Save for an occasional burlesque show , his fun was of the innocent variety . After his parents moved to Clinton , he stayed briefly with his father 's sister , Emma ( Mrs. Rochester Colgan ) , on Twenty-ninth Street , and then moved into a boardinghouse run by Mrs. Trow at 1314 Troost Avenue . The guests lived two to a room , paying $5 a week for bed , breakfast , and dinner . Harry customarily purchased a 10-cent box lunch at a shop on East Eighth Street . One of his fellow boarders , a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Commerce Bank while Harry was still there ; he recalled that he and Harry had about $1 a week for riotous living . ( Arthur stayed at Commerce Bank , becoming a senior executive before his retirement at about the time his brother Dwight succeeded Harry as president of the United States. ) // Life was comfortable and civilized . Harry from time to time played Mrs. Trow 's piano for two young ladies who lived in the house . As his income increased , he and his friends enjoyed occasional evenings at one of the city 's steak houses . On many weekends , he went to Clinton to see his parents or out to Grandview to see his grandmother and Uncle Harrison . // He was capable of cruel practical jokes . He and his cousin Mary Colgan tricked her brother Fred and a fellow bank clerk into believing that a note they had put in a bottle and tossed into the Blue River had been retrieved by a southern belle in Mississippi . Weeks of correspondence followed , culminating with the young lady 's declaration that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary produced the young men 's letters , sent back to her by a friend who had provided a mailing address in Greenville , Mississippi . she read them aloud . A grinning Harry announced that the had dictated the imaginary belle 's epistles and Cousin Mary had written them . // Harry likely attended services at the Benton Boulevard Baptist Church fairly regularly . It was there that he felt a sense of salvation , was baptized , and was accepted as a member . The Trumans probably had not attended church regularly in Independence , and Harry 's own attendance eventually became infrequent . Nevertheless , the Baptist faith meant a great deal to him , however much in his subsequent years he would ignore its prohibitions against liquor , cards , and swearing . He found intellectual solace in being a member of a faith that allowed the common man direct access to God . The lines of church authority ran from the bottom up ; the worship services were simple and unpretentious . The Bible also had great importance for him ; throughout his life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , he nevertheless always retained just a bit of distrust for Catholics and Jews . // In 1905 , soon after his twenty-first birthday , he and some friends from the bank joined a new National Guard artillery battery , commanded by Captain George R. Collins . For Truman , the move was a matter of patriotism and a modest fulfillment of his military aspirations . It was also a way of making connections with other ambitious young men like himself and getting to know senior notables like Collins . The officers took their duties seriously , and many had military backgrounds . However , no one entered the command ranks without some political attachments . Harry soon discovered that not everyone in his family was thrilled about his decision . Shortly after signing up , he made the mistake of wearing his dress blues with red striping down the legs  --  ominously similar to the garb of Jim Lane 's men  --  out to Grandview to display to Grandmother Young : " She looked me over and I knew I was going to catch it . She said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue uniform had been in this house . Do n't bring it here again . ' I didn't. " // He found the Guard experience , especially summer training camp , exhilarating . It provided a sense of comradeship , shared effort , and achievement . He liked to recall how the men would sing on the way to and from camp , how they had learned to drill and to fire light artillery pieces , how they occasionally harassed unpopular officers . He met some important associates , among them lieutenant Fred Boxley , a prominent attorney with political and military connections , and one of the sergeants , an overweight bank clerk named Arthur Elliott . He was soon promoted to corporal and made battery clerk . The thrill of that first promotion , he later felt , was never surpassed , not even when he received a captaincy signed by Woodrow Wilson himself . Once he was awestruck when Captain Collins asked him for help in removing his boots . // Still , he kept his sense of humor . One evening in 1906 or 1907 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrant and veteran of the Grenadier Guards , Ted Marks . Marks always remembered Truman asking him how long he had been in the country . " Six months , " Marks had replied . " You speak pretty good English for someone who 's only been in the United States for six months , " Truman remarked with a straight face . // His favorite civilian diversion was the theater . On Saturdays , he worked as an usher at one of the vaudeville houses , where he saw all the famous acts of the era , including the Four Cohans , Eddie Foy , and Sarah Bernhardt . He attended grand opera , performances by famous pianists , Shakespeare plays , contemporary dramas , and light musicals . He recalled such experiences with a special fondness decades later . // Only one thing seems to have been missing from a generally satisfactory existence . If Truman had anything approaching a serious relationship with a young woman , it is lost to history . He still frequently escorted Cousin Ethel , but they apparently never allowed their relationship to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1920 , he described one of the female boarders at Mrs. Trow 's house " that we all thought a great deal of , " a pleasant , nice-looking schoolteacher named Cosby Bailey . Perhaps he was attached to her ; clearly , he enjoyed her companionship , but his passing mention of her leaves the impression that he did so in the company of the other boarders . Some people vaguely remembered that he was interested for a time in someone else , but no evidence survives . He rarely , if ever , encountered Bess Wallace in Independence . // Bess 's own life had been blighted by an unmentionable personal tragedy . Shortly after Harry had started to work at Commerce Bank in mid-1903 , her father , suffering ( according to some memories ) from throat cancer and deeply in debt , sat down in the bathtub shortly before dawn one morning , put a pistol to his head , and killed himself . Madge Wallace took the children to Colorado for a year , and then returned to Independence and moved into her father 's big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a finishing school in Kansas City for the next two years , graduating in 1906 and staying with her mother , who suffered from chronic health problems . A succession of beaux courted Bess , but Harry was not prominent among them , quite probably not among them at all . // That he thought and dreamed about her her seems certain . It is less clear why he did not after a time give up and begin to take a practical survey of more available women . Of course , he lived in an age in which men tended to marry later in life than they do today , and was of a culture in which male-female relationships tended to be stilted and uneasy . Moreover , he undoubtedly continued to harbor within himself the exaggerated fear of the opposite sex that had possessed him as a child ; he still coped with it by fixating on an unobtainable love . // X // Whatever his difficulties in relating to women , Truman had done well for himself in other ways . He had many friends , had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of city life . Remarkably , he decided to give it up . // His parents had stayed in Clinton for only a year . Bad luck had followed them ; John Truman had grown a fine crop of corn , only to see the Grand River spill over its banks and wipe it out . In October 1905 , at Grandmother Young 's request , John Martha , and daughter Mary Jane moved back to Grandview to take over the management of the farm from Uncle Harrison , who preferred the high life of the city to agricultural drudgery . They asked Harry and Vivian to come and help . Vivian left the First National Bank sometime in late 1905 or early 1906 . Harry agreed to quit his job in mid-1906. // Why did he do it ? Years later , he said that he had grown tired of looking at rows of figures . Perhaps he appreciated that his family was in line to inherit the prime spread and that someday part of it would be his . Perhaps he simply felt a sense of responsibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The passage of time between his parent 's move to Grandview and his resignation at the bank suggests that the decision was difficult . // One thing is certain . Like many a twenty-two-year-old , he had not yet established a firm sense of purpose in his life . Lacking competing ties to a wife or fiance , not absolutely determined to be a banker , and possibly sensing an occasion to prove his masculinity , he found it easy enough to accede to his father 's call and shift from one tentatively established life pattern to another . What he could not have foreseen was a future of eleven years of hard , unrewarding labor .
