<p> Bush administration officials are seriously considering a one-time , election-year tax rebate of as much as $ 300 for each U.S. taxpayer next spring as a way of trying to spur consumers to spend the economy into a recovery , congressional officials said yesterday . <p> The search for a way to put extra money in consumer hands early next year is driven by what is perceived to be the political imperative for President Bush to respond to the slumping economy . In an abrupt shift of its public stance , the White House acknowledged for the first time yesterday that the nation 's economy is still mired in recession . <p> " For all practical purposes , the recession continues , " White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters . " The recovery is not underway because the economy has been flat and sluggish . " <p> Later , Bush tried to avoid the word . " I am less interested in what the technical definition is , " he said in a satellite interview with television station WPVI in Philadelphia . " You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when there 's this kind of sluggishness and concern  --  definitions , heck with it . Let 's get on with the business at hand . " <p> While the idea of a tax rebate may be politically potent , economists said there would be little impact from giving taxpayers less than $ 1 a day . They predicted that most of the money would be used to pay off debts or saved rather than added to the economy as consumer spending . Details , Page A18 . <p> To get quick action on tax rebate legislation , Office of Management and Budget Director Richard G. Darman and Senate Minority Leader Robert J. Dole ( R-Kan. ) want Congress to consider it separately from more contentious , long-range items such as a cut in the capital gains tax rate and a credit for capital investments by companies . <p> Such an approach  --  which would drastically reduce the likelihood of enacting the second package  --  faces strong opposition from conservative House Republicans led by Minority Whip Newt Gingrich ( Ga. ) , who said it would be " extraordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender to the liberal Democratic leadership of Congress . " Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D-Tex. ) also has criticized the two-track approach . <p> Gingrich derided the tax rebate as an " itty-bitty proposal " that has the advantage of returning people 's money to them , a concept conservatives applaud , but the disadvantage of doing nothing to create jobs or cure any of the economy 's ills . " It is an unmitigated disaster , " he said . <p> Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp , a Gingrich ally , also had scathing words for the idea of enacting a tax rebate , then taking up longer-term tax proposals . " It 's Jimmy Carteresque , " he said , referring to the former president 's abortive $ 50 tax rebate proposal early in his administration . Such a plan , Kemp said , " will do nothing to attack the real problems of the economy " and will cause a postponement of action on " real solutions " to the recession . <p> The tax rebate would balloon by as much as $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congressional Budget Office at a record $ 362 billion , congressional officials said . With the administration 's declaration of an economic emergency , the constraints of last year 's budget agreement would be waived for 1992 , but the fiscal discipline of the budget pact for future years would not be affected . <p> Bentsen and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D-Ill. ) have proposed tax cuts of roughly the same size as the administration 's one-time rebate . But both congressional plans would be permanent changes in the tax code and would be paid for by cutting military spending , in Bentsen 's case , or by raising income tax rates for individuals earning more than $ 85,000 a year and couples filing jointly earning more than $ 145,000 , in the Rostenkowski plan . <p> Fitzwater said the pronouncement that the recession that began in July 1990 is continuing is a further attempt to combat the perception that Bush is out of touch with the problems of average Americans . For weeks , Bush has been trying to emphasize his concern for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics showing that the output of the U.S. economy grew in late spring and early summer , Bush and his top economic advisers had argued that the recession was over , although the recovery was weak . But those comments in the face of mounting bad economic news left the impression that " the president does n't understand the seriousness of this , " Fitzwater said . " His repeated comments that he cares deeply about this problem just has n't broken through . " <p> Fitzwater blamed the economy for the results of the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll , which found that for the first time , fewer than half of those questioned said they approved of Bush 's performance as president . <p> The presidential spokesman tried to portray his declaration as consistent with earlier statements . " We 've been saying for three or four months that the recovery is not underway , " Fitzwater told reporters . <p> On Nov. 13 , however , Bush told a local television reporter in St. Louis : " We 've been through a recession . And I say ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in a recession . " <p> And on Dec. 6 , the president spoke as if the economic recovery were already underway , telling the Ontario , Calif. , Kiwanis and Rotary clubs : " I am confident  --  confident that here in California and across the country  --  our recovery will gain speed . " <p> Fitzwater later tried to temper his statement by saying that it was not meant to indicate that the administration was forecasting two consecutive quarters of economic contraction , the standard measure of a recession . A private research group , the National Bureau of Economic Research , will ultimately make the call whether there has been a recession . <p> Michael J. Boskin , chairman of the president 's Council of Economic Advisers , has told congressional budget officials that data due to be released shortly before Bush 's Jan. 28 State of the Union address may show that economic output declined in the final three months of this year after modest growth in the third quarter , the officials said . <p> Administration officials are looking at the tax rebate as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid two consecutive negative quarters . Administration officials are looking for a way to at least promise by March to provide the extra money . <p> The one-time rebate of between $ 200 and $ 300 would be linked to taxpayers ' wages and not unearned income from interest , dividends and other investments , the congressional officials said . Such proponents as Darman and Dole argue that it would be quickly implemented , be short-term in effect and leave the discipline of the budget agreement intact , the officials said . <p> The two-track approach to legislative packages is one of many being discussed with lawmakers , White House Chief of Staff Samuel K. Skinner said in an interview . The president has not decided on a course of action , he said . <p> The question is part of what one official called " a genuine , full-scale debate " inside the White House that probably will not be settled until next month . <p> Gingrich met with Darman for more than an hour yesterday to discuss economic legislation and said later that the budget director did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am certain Dick is not committed to this , if he is mentioning it , " Gingrich said in an interview . " He is too sophisticated to think it would be anything but disastrous . " Darman did not respond to a reporter 's phone calls yesterday . <p> Gingrich said the two-track approach would be impossible without support of the conservative House Republicans he leads , predicting the chances the administration would choose that course are " zero , none , nada . " In a clear warning to the White House on the restiveness of conservatives , he said : " Can you imagine President Bush , one week before the New Hampshire primary , giving a State of the Union proposal that the Democrats applaud while the Reagan wing of the party sits on its hands ? With Patrick Buchanan in New Hampshire , it ca n't happen . "
