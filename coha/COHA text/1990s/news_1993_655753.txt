<p> THE stage is bare . A balding man with a cherubic face , clad in open-neck shirt , jeans , and sneakers is seated on a stool . He talks in a rapid , snappy style . <p> The well-heeled audience laughs repeatedly at his clever word play . He recites verbatim from a recent debate in Germany 's parliament about the current hatred toward foreigners living in the country . Many quotes ; many more laughs . Without the audience realizing it , he effortlessly slips into statements from elsewhere , on the same subject . <p> It gradually dawns on everyone what they are now listening to . These are the words of Adolf Hitler , penned about 60 years ago in " Mein Kampf , " only shortly thereafter to be echoed by large sections of German citizenry during the Nazi era . <p> " I show how many parallels there are in democratic , or so-called democratic , thinking , " says leading Berlin cabaret artist Martin Buchholz . " The exact same terms that Germans used in Hitler 's day , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , there is a growing hatred against all ' un-German ' people . " <p> A good political-cabaret artist , or kabarettist , Mr. Buchholz says , is " an uncomfortable thinker " - uncomfortable for his audiences as well as himself . <p> " It 's much nicer to arrange flowers , " he remarks with a wry smile . " Sometimes when I am on holiday , I try to stop - not my thinking - but that way of thinking , that over-critical thinking . " But once your eyes are opened to seeing past society 's more acceptable facade , he muses , to relax even for a while is nearly impossible . The mask of ' pro-Semitism ' <p> While the majority of his countrymen might reject the notion that there is a significant amount of anti-Semitism in modern Germany - pointing out that jokes or caricatures of Jewish people are among the few taboos in public entertainment - Buchholz holds a different view . <p> " What we have here is anti-Semitism with the face of pro-Semitism , " he says . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this mask of pro-Semitism . And in normal speech , you can not find anything wrong with what is said . But then I take the common things that are spoken on this subject and take them , on stage , word by word - with a little turn - and then everyone suddenly hears , perhaps for the first time ... the undertones that swing the meaning . " <p> Political cabaret is a wholly and uniquely German phenomenon . The staging ranges from nondescript to nonexistent . The emphasis is on the verbal rather than the visual . While the mode is humor , often brutally so , the overriding purpose is to provoke . Complacency and the status quo are invariably the targets . Political kabarettists see themselves in a direct philosophical line from the Enlightenment . <p> As one kabarettist put it , summing up the general view : " The most important function of political cabaret is to continue the Enlightenment tradition , to believe that if man is given the full information and facts , you can trust his reasoning . This kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people - to think for themselves , to see what kind of things are happening around them and to help them work at reaching their own opinion and , most important , to actually speak that opinion . " <p> It is often said that a good political-cabaret show is comparable to reading a week of newspapers . For Buchholz that is an understatement . " My aim is to get my audience to re-read those newspapers , behind the headlines , and to re-hear the words of politicians and so on , " he says , adding , " to read them with different eyes and hear them with different ears . " The rise of political cabaret <p> Political cabaret began in Berlin over a century ago , during the repressive early years of Kaiser Wilhelm II 's reign , in a reaction against the officially sanctioned theater . It soon spread to other German cities , most notably Munich . <p> These original political kabarettists hoped to incorporate the humanist principles that surfaced in the French Revolution into the fabric of German society . <p> Political cabaret flourished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clubs in Berlin alone - but was finally banned during the Nazi period , only to reemerge after World War II , with particular zeal in East Germany . <p> The art form was made famous beyond German borders , although in misleading and overly glamorized Hollywood fashion , in the 1970s film " Cabaret , " starring Liza Minnelli . During the communist period , East Germany had over 600 political-cabaret venues . <p> With the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 , the majority of political-cabaret clubs closed their doors . The Communist Party was finished ; the Wall had been reduced to rubble ; the enemy was gone . There seemed , for a time , nothing important left to fight against . West German political cabarets , shrinking in number for decades , lost their punch in the 1960s . <p> But today political cabaret is finding renewed impetus in the city where it was born . In recent months , renowned political-cabaret theaters such as Die Distel , in East Berlin , which suffered a huge drop in audiences immediately following the tearing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so great that people had a two-year wait - are currently experiencing a burgeoning of fresh audience interest . The theater is once again regularly playing to full houses . <p> Its equally respected West-side counterpart , Die Wuhlmause , is also enjoying a similar audience boom . Indeed , of the 22 cabaret clubs in Berlin , all six of the solely political-cabaret spots are currently flourishing . Added to these , smaller , amateur political-cabaret houses are popping up virtually every month around town in response to the growing wave of popularity . <p> The reasons for this are clear for those who live in the city . As Frank Bohnke , a West Berlin investment banker puts it , " The two sides , East and West , are even further apart than before the Wall came down . In those days , we in the West did n't think about East Berlin ; you never had to fit together . Now we do , and the gap is much wider . " <p> And there is , of course , the disturbing specter of the renewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress at the trend ; their work , they say , is all the more necessary today as a counterforce . <p> " My most important theme right now , " says Dieter Hildebrandt , generally considered the " grand old man " of postwar political cabaret , " is to keep this new German democracy , and to tell the people what they have to do to keep it . The German people , you know , have no historical tradition in democracy : 50 years is not very long . They know how to do it , but sometimes they do n't want to do it . " <p> His kabarettist colleague , Franz-Josef Grummer , agrees . " There are a lot of people in this country at the moment who wish for a furher , " he explains . " It comes from the ... mentality that is very strong here : ' I need someone to tell me what I should do , then I do it , and I do it as best as possible . ' Well , look at just 50 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he did it the best he could . You know the result . " The kabarettist as idealist <p> Buchholz is typical of many of his breed of kabarettists . A highly educated , self-confessed idealist , he gravitated to political-cabaret work because of his belief in the importance of social change . He spent 22 years as a journalist - crime reporter , movie critic , then political editor of a large Berlin newspaper - while performing cabaret as a hobby . <p> The hobby eventually took over . He is today widely viewed as one of the most important and incisive political kabarettists around . And he is very worried about his country . <p> When asked if a reunited Germany is a potentially dangerous thing , Buchholz says candidly , " This is also my fear . I talk about it all the time in my cabaret show . That danger is the very sort of exaggeration I do on stage , to depict the people , the mentality and the roots of that mentality - and also the disturbing possibility that history can be repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 1920s who proved uncannily accurate in predicting the rise of a fascist German state that would , within two decades , wage war against the rest of Europe . Political kabarettists always satirically exaggerate the present situation , with the underlying hope that such an exaggeration will never occur . <p> But good political kabarettists , Buchholz says , see the trends long before the general public ; and , unfortunately , " these exaggerations not only happen , " he laments , " but sometimes in a shorter period than we could ever imagine . " <p> Political cabaret is all the more needed right now , observes Buchholz , by the very fact that it is becoming increasingly hazardous to do . <p> Apart from a sharp influx of abusive letters and phone calls he has received as a result of the topical social criticism in his shows , Buchholz describes an occurrence not long ago that rocked him to the core : One warm evening , he had the stage door open during his performance . Midway , he was suddenly pelted with stones by a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " and Nazi salutes . The audience had the impression that it was part of the show . <p> A deeply shaken Buchholz hid his shock , while locking the door . He deftly carried on . " But I was very scared , " he admits . " The clearer you are in saying things today , the more dangerous it is. "
