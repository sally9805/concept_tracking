They had arranged to have dinner in the old town square of Domme , a village on top of a cliff a few miles from their site . By nightfall , Chris , grumpy all day , had recovered from his bad mood and was looking forward to dinner . He wondered if Marek had heard from the Professor , and if not , what they were going to do about it . He had a sense of expectancy . His good mood vanished when he arrived to find the stockbroker couples again , sitting at their table . Apparently they 'd been invited for a second night . Chris was about to turn around and leave , but Kate got up and quickly put her arm around his waist , and steered him toward the table . " I 'd rather not , " he said in a low voice . " I ca n't stand these people . " But then she gave him a little hug , and eased him into a chair . He saw that the stockbrokers must be buying the wine tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle . And he thought , What the hell . " Well , this is a charming town , " one of the women was saying . " We went and saw the walls around the outside . They go on for quite a distance . High , too . And that very pretty gate coming into town , you know , with the two round towers on either side . " Kate nodded . " It 's sort of ironic , " she said , " that a lot of the villages that we find so charming now were actually the shopping malls of the fourteenth century . " " Shopping malls ? How do you mean ? " the woman asked . At that moment , Marek 's radio , clipped to his belt , crackled with static . " Andr ? Are you there ? " It was Elsie . She never came to dinner with the others , but worked late on her cataloging . Marek held up the radio . " Yes , Elsie . " " I just found something very weird , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over ? I need his help testing . But I 'm telling you guys  --  if this is a joke , I do n't appreciate it . " With a click , the radio went dead . " Elsie ? " No answer . Marek looked around the table . " Anybody play a joke on her ? " They all shook their heads no . Chris Hughes said , " Maybe she 's cracking up . It would n't surprise me , all those hours staring at parchment . " " I 'll see what she wants , " David Stern said , getting up from the table . He headed off into the darkness . Chris thought of going with him , but Kate looked at him quickly , and gave him a smile . So he eased back in his seat and reached for his wine . " You were saying  --  these towns were like shopping malls ? " " A lot of them were , yes , " Kate Erickson said . " These towns were speculative ventures to make money for land developers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were all built on a similar pattern . " She turned in her chair and pointed to the Domme town square behind them . " See the covered wooden market in the center of the town square ? You 'll find similar covered markets in lots of towns around here . It means the town is a bastide , a new , fortified village . Nearly a thousand bastide towns were built in France during the fourteenth century . Some of them were built to hold territory . But many of them were built simply to make money . " That got the attention of the stock pickers . One of the men looked up sharply and said , " Wait a minute . How does building a village make anybody money ? " Kate smiled . " Fourteenth-century economics , " she said . " It worked like this . Let 's say you 're a nobleman who owns a lot of land . Fourteenth-century France is mostly forest , which means that your land is mostly forest , inhabited by wolves . Maybe you have a few farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that 's no way to get rich . And because you 're a nobleman , you 're always desperately in need of money , to fight wars and to entertain in the lavish style that 's expected of you . " So what can you do to increase the income from your lands ? You build a new town . You attract people to live in your new town by offering them special tax breaks , special liberties spelled out in the town charter . Basically , you free the townspeople from feudal obligations . " " Why do you give them these breaks ? " one of the men said . " Because pretty soon you 'll have merchants and markets in the town , and the taxes and fees generate much more money for you . You charge for everything . For the use of the road to come to the town . For the right to enter the town walls . For the right to set up a stall in the market . For the cost of soldiers to keep order . For providing moneylenders to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men said . " Not bad at all . And in addition , you take a percentage of everything that 's sold in the market . " " Really ? What percentage ? " " It depended on the place , and the particular merchandise . In general , one to five percent . So the market is really the reason for the town . You can see it clearly , in the way the town is laid out . Look at the church over there , " she said , pointing off to the side . " In earlier centuries , the church was the center of the town . People went to Mass at least once a day . All life revolved around the church . But here in Domme , the church is off to one side . The market is now the center of town . " " So all the money comes from the market ? " " Not entirely , because the fortified town offers protection for the area , which means farmers will clear the nearby land and start new farms . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all , a new town was a reliable investment . Which is why so many of these towns were built . " " Is that the only reason the towns were built ? " " No , many were built for military considerations as  --  " Marek 's radio crackled . It was Elsie again . " Andr ? " " Yes , " Marek said . " You better get over here right away . Because I do n't know how to handle this . " " Why ? What is it ? " " Just come . Now . " The generator chugged loudly , and the farmhouse seemed brilliantly lit in the dark field , under a sky of stars . They all crowded into the farmhouse . Elsie was sitting at her desk in the center , staring at them . Her eyes seemed distant . " Elsie ? " " It 's impossible , " she said . " What 's impossible ? What happened here ? " Marek looked over at David Stern , but he was still working at some analysis in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , I do n't know . . . . " " Well , " Marek said , " start at the beginning . " " Okay , " she said . " The beginning . " She stood up and crossed the room , where she pointed to a stack of parchments resting on a piece of plastic tarp on the floor . " This is the beginning . The document bundle I designated M-031 , dug up from the monastery earlier today . David asked me to do it as soon as possible . " Nobody said anything . They just watched her . " Okay , " she said . " I 've been going through the bundle . This is how I do it . I take about ten parchments at a time and bring them over here to my desk . " She brought ten over . " Now , I sit down at the desk , and I go through them , one by one . Then , after I 've summarized the contents of one sheet , and entered the summary into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over here . " She went to the next table , slipped a parchment under the camera . Marek said , " We 're familiar with  --  " " No , you 're not , " she said sharply . " You 're not familiar at all . " Elsie went back to her table , took the next parchment off the stack . " Okay . So I go through them one by one . This particular stack consists of all kinds of documents : bills , copies of letters , replies to orders from the bishop , records of crop yields , lists of monastery assets . All dating from about the year 1357 . " She took the parchments from the stack , one after the other . " And then "  --  she removed the last one  --  " I see this . " They stared . Nobody said anything . The parchment was identical in size to the others in the stack , but instead of dense writing in Latin or Old French , this one had only two words , scrawled in plain English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " that 's the Professor 's handwriting .
