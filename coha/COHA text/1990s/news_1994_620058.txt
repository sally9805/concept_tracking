<p> Willie is a railbird , standing at the rail . Willie is in his element . Willie is the master of his universe , a master of the rails . <p> Leaning on the rail outside the walking ring at Bay Meadows , Willie is watching the horses circle before a race . He and the other railbirds are like livestock judges at a county fair , assessing fetlocks and forelocks , withers and hooves , hocks and shanks . Each railbird sees something nobody else sees and knows something nobody else knows . <p> Willie is our tour guide . <p> " Man , they look good , do n't they ? " Willie asks . " You know what ? They eat good , too . " <p> The rail is an altar . It is a place to give thanks . It is for those facing lost causes , and for those damned to their own private fires . More than anything , it is a place for hope , however misguided . <p> There 's something oddly rhythmic about life on the rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with brief flashes of heart-quickening excitement molded around several hours of crushing boredom . <p> The race starts and the railbirds move , trancelike , toward the home-stretch rail . It is an undertow , pulling them out . They are defenseless in the face of such a force . The race ends , and the railbirds recede , back to their programs and racing forms and insights . Then , of course , back inside to the betting windows . <p> The tide goes in , the tide goes out . <p> Willie sees himself as having a jeweler 's eye . He puts his glasses on and takes them off , getting every possible look . His eyes go from the horse to the board to his program . This is serious business . <p> " Eleven-four , eleven-two , eleven-four-two , " he says , throwing in some unprintable adjectives . ( You would never imagine the leading rider in the nation the past two years , because Willie does n't trust him . He thinks Baze is as good as he wants to be  --  " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Willie is middle-aged and medium-sized , and he looks as if life has n't always been maintenance- free . He wagers for income , not fun , which makes the stakes about as high as they get . Willie says he won $ 3,200 at the track just three days before . He bets anywhere from $ 150-200 per day , every day they race . He does n't remember his best day . <p> " I just look at them horses , " Willie says . " I look out at them horses , and I feel I can just pick ' em once I look at ' em real good . I miss it . . . but I win , too . " <p> The secret is in the eyes  --  Willie 's eyes . He started his trek to the racetracks  --  Golden Gate Fields , Bay Meadows , about 200 days a year  --  eight years ago . <p> " Looking at the horses , that 's all , " he says . " Long bodies , short bodies on the horses . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , for them long races  --  long , long bodies . You know , yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Long bodies for long races . " <p> Willie 's shirt is unbuttoned and untucked , and it flies open like a cape as the horses turn the final corner and he moves to the rail . One thing you can say about him : Dressed like this , he does n't have far to go to lose his shirt . <p> " I love this , " he says . " Would n't want to be anywhere else . " <p> It is a low-attendance Thursday at Bay Meadows . Before the first race , everybody in the grandstand apron area  --  home base for the railbird  --  seems restless and enthusiastic . There is a frantic , plaintive energy to the place , with everyone thinking  --  no , knowing  --  this will be the big day . <p> These are the regulars , the guys who keep the track going . They might not place the largest bets , but they 're there , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OBEY <p> The second race is off , and immediately there is a guy with a nearly full complement of teeth running toward the rail . The normal protocol calls for a gradual , cool walk to the rail , but this guy is running and yelling : " Eleven-four ! Eleven-four ! Eleven-four ! Eleven- four ! " Over and over and over again he yells this , as if sheer repetition can make it happen , as if the horses had no other choice but to listen and obey . They did n't , though , not even close . The man retraced his steps , faster this time , screaming " Fix in ! Fix in ! Fix in ! " <p> Of course . Fix in . <p> By the fourth race , the atmosphere has changed . The elements of addiction are on full display . There is a line forming behind the automated teller , conveniently located near the betting booths . There is something in the air , something like desperation mixed with body odor . <p> There are a lot of hollow looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " This is the way it is , man , " Willie says , laughing . " You got to make it play out , keep yourself even . Ca n't go too much too fast . That 's the mistake . You got ta learn . " <p> There are several men picking through discarded tickets , openly and shamelessly . The tickets are scattered about the asphalt , and these scavengers for wealth are checking them out . Fellini meets Dickens . You never know when somebody might be too drunk or too old or too clumsy or too stupid to hang on to a winner . <p> " You 'd be surprised , " one man said when asked how often his stooping pays off . <p> Most of the railbirds dress in a fashion best described as thrift- store shabby : sport coat and tennis shoes , with a lot of polyester in between . The railbird 's walk is contingent upon his winnings : bouncy strolls for the winner , brooding stalks for the loser . <p> SMOKE IN THE AIR <p> It is impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , or too creatively . More than anything , it is impossible to smoke too much . <p> Smoking , in fact , appears to be a requirement . <p> During the race , the railbird has been known to scream at the horses , who really have no idea what 's at stake . <p> There is an overwhelming maleness to it all . Very few women down here . They might be up in the boxes , with the horse owners , or up in the turf club with the suits . Whatever , they are n't here . <p> The names of the horses do n't matter . The horses are not called by name : They are " The Seven " or " The Nine " or " That Damned 12 . " If you bet a horse because it has a cute name or you like the spot on its nose , keep it to yourself or go upstairs with the guys on their lunch break . <p> DAY AT THE OFFICE <p> On the rails , this is work . Willie is from San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching metal benches bolted into the stained and cracked asphalt . Everybody seems to know Willie , and some ask for advice . His speech has a rolling beauty to it , like a backwoods preacher after too much coffee . <p> " This is it , every day , " Willie says . " It 's heartbreakin ' sometimes . Heartbreakin ' . I mean heartbreakin ' . You sweat every day . You sweat every day . " <p> The railbird has a remarkably short memory . The lost race is gone the second it 's over , to be replaced immediately by the promise of inevitable winnings . <p> For all its shabbiness and seediness , the life of the railbird is an inherently optimistic one . These are people who completely ignore all forms of statistical probability , people who truly believe they were born to be the fabled one in a million . They believe there is a fence at every cliff . They 're going to win the lottery , the daily double , the biggest bingo pot , the slot-machine jackpot , whatever there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . <p> There 's something to be said for hope , it seems , regardless how false . <p> Willie decided to take it easy on the sixth race ; it had n't been a particularly productive day . He was going to place two bets and two bets only . He did n't think there was any chance he could lose , of course . He placed the two bets , started away from the window and then turned back at the last second . <p> He placed one more bet , a $ 5 exacta . He just could n't help himself . He walked away nodding confidently ; that one clinched it : This would be a winner . <p> A RUN FOR HIS MONEY <p> Every horse carries a little piece of him with it as it rounds the backstretch . <p> " Living on the edge , " Willie says , laughing at the perfection of the description . " That 's exactly what you call it  --  living on the edge . That 's good . That 's the best way to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no limit on the number of ways a man can make a buck using his wits  --  and his God- given right to mix those wits with genetic good luck . <p> " I do a lot of dice , too . Dice , I like that , " Willie says . " We start at a beer then up playing a hundred dollars a shot . You start with a beer . <p> " Cards , that 's my thing , too . Football , baseball  --  I bet ' em all . " <p> Willie missed the sixth race , putting him about even for the day . <p> " Damn , blew that one , " he said . " Eleven-three , eleven-three . I had it backwards . Blew that one . <p> " That 's all right , just all right . I 'll make up on this next one . " <p> There is always hope , of course . Willie came back strong in the final two races , turning a dismal day into a minor triumph . <p> " Not bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Got me a good one . Got me a little bit . Enough till tomorrow . Ai n't that all that counts ? "
