Maybe it was n't such a bad deal after all . Last December , Los Angeles awarded Japan 's Sumitomo Corp . a contract to build 41 cars for its light-rail system . A month later , the company was derailed from the $121 million contract when , in a fit of buy-American sentiment stirred in part by George Bush 's visit to Japan , the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission canceled the deal and said it would rewrite the specifications to attract a U.S. company . Last week the commission revealed the firm selected to build 15 of the new cars : Sumitomo Corp . <P> After considerable searching , the panel admitted , it had found no American contractor that would agree to accept the revised specs . To save face for Angelenos , the new contract includes a Sumitomo commitment to ship cars from its Nagoya factory to Los Angeles in partly completed condition  --  thus creating 79 assembly jobs in Los Angeles  --  and to spend 60% of the contract 's value in the U.S.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
