I ca n't tell you how sorry I am that I am going to miss Dash 's memorial . His great finale . But I know he , of all people , would understand " The show ( in my case , the film ) must go on . " Please know , dear friends , that although my flesh is absent , my soul is present.Enjoy your stay at my lake cottage . My assistant Bert will get you the keys . It 's a shame Dash never had time to visit while he was alive . But now he can rest there in peace forever by the lake under the enchanted trees.I miss you all so much ! Next season I must come back to Chicago and do a show for The Red Lantern . As you know , I 've always longed to do Blanche in Streetcar . Dash was the first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born to play Dubois ! " How he believed in meOh dear , I 'm going to break down if I continue . Please . I 'm so sorry I wo n't be with you . I 'll send flowers . I love you all . ( Blowing a kiss . ) Your Vickie . ( Blackout . Music up. ) @x Victor Lloyd 's lake cottage  --  the living room . There are three entrances and exits : the front door , to the kitchen , and up the birch-tree staircase . Prominent in the room is a life-size cutout replica of Dash Grey , a dashing man in his forties with blazing eyes , sensual sneering lips , and a thin pale wolflike face . He is gesturing triumphantly with a red umbrella . Various stage props surround the figure including : a long blond wig , a red veil , congo drums , hideous masks with the eyes stabbed out , a life-size teddy bear . There is an ancient tree that grows through the room , giving the feel of enchantment . Caroleena Lark , twenties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a video camera with Bob Gray , forties , a man dressed in brown polyester . They watch Victor 's tape . LARK Can you do something more like that ? GRAY No . LARK Here is the problem , Bob , you are an amateur . You are not comfortable in front of a camera . I think you need direction . That 's when I tell you what to do and you do it . Okay . Move over by Dash . Closer , Bob . Unfold your arms . Bob . Good . Now put one arm around him . Put your arm around Dash . ( Bob complies . ) LARK Now smile but with sadness . p. 4 GRAY I  --  ca n't do this . ( Bob moves away from the cutout . ) LARK ( Urging him back . ) Fine then . It was just a suggestion . I was trying to give you some direction . Go on back over there and talk about him . Please , Bob , we have a time constraint . ( She turns on the video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dash . ) LARK Rolling . We 're rolling . GRAY Danny  --  LARK Dash . GRAY Dash . He was my brother . But he died . When he was born his name was Daniel Frank Gray . We called him Danny but you people call him Dash . LARK ( In a whisper . ) Tell about where you grew up . GRAY We grew up in Casper , Wyoming . We had a mother and  --  a father . We both went to school : grade school , junior high , and high school . I got married . Danny never did . LARK You 've got to do better than that . ( Kate Spoon , forties , a small , energetic woman , enters carrying a piece of toast on a plate . She wears a bright sweater decorated with rhinestone cats. ) p. 5 MULLIGAN I 've made cinnamon toast . LARK I 'm in charge here and you 've got to do better than that .

You have a unique vocal range . LARK Listen , Bob , I assured Jasper I could do an excellent job on your memorial tape with Dash . Please , I 'm on thin ice around here and it 's vital that I do a very good job . GRAY ( Mouthing . ) I 'm not talking . LARK What ? GRAY ( Mouthing . ) I 'm not talking . LARK I just want to say , I know what 's going on around here and it 's sabotage . MULLIGAN Who 're you talking to ? Are you talking to me ? Do n't involve me .

I mean it was reallyHe looked at me like I was something expected . p. 8 MULLIGAN ( Who has been primping . ) Do you think he 'll remember me ? It 's been so many years . He hardly knew me in the first place . I 'm no one he should know . ( Eddy Canary enters . He is pale with thinning hair that is matted to his head with sweat . He grins a charming death grin ; a red carnation is pinned to his coat . ) DALE Eddy . Come in . Are you feeling alright ? CANARY Excellent . Yes . DALE Well , ah  --  ( Eddy spots the cutout of Dash . ) CANARY Aah ! DALE Yes , Dash . There 's Dash . CANARY Looking good . DALE He wanted to be here . He requested it . CANARY Understandably , absolutely , his last hurrah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's so . Ah , this is Dash 's brother Bob . CANARY Bob . DALE And this is Kate Spoon . MULLIGAN I do n't suppose you remember me ? I was in Dash 's class years ago . I did a scene from Trojan Women and Dash threw an apple core at me . Later at the Pub you said both of us had suffered and because of that , no matter what  --  wherever we went  --  whatever paths we took we would always be " kindred . " Then we clinked glasses . p. 9 CANARY Dash threw an apple core at you ! MULLIGAN It knocked me in the chest , then Dash stood up , pointed at me with his red umbrella and yelled , " Where 's your truth , you rolling cow ? " I left the theatre after that . I married a man I never loved and my whole life changed . I do n't suppose you remember when we made that toast ? CANARY Vividly . Yes . Oh yes . MULLIGAN You 're being polite . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've hardly met . LARK I 'm Caroleena Lark . I 'm the one who found you .

Serve yourself . I 'm not waiting tables this week . ( Bob exits to the kitchen . ) DALE He 's nothing like Dash . They 're nothing like brothers . LARK I know , it 's like me . I 'm the only one in my family who 's been a success . DALE Well , I must say , you did surprise me . You are , in fact , a very good psychic . Against all odds we 've actually found Eddy Canary and gotten him here . Except for Victor Lloyd , Dash 's circle is complete ! LARK Victor Lloyd and Earl Bell . DALE Earl 's not important . Who was he ? What was he ? Dash 's minion of the month . p. 11 LARK Earl the squirrel . Earl the squirrel . Chip , chip , chip . DALE Everything 's going just as Dash would have wished except that Vickie 's off doing that cartoon whatever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really , it 's awful . LARK If anyone can pull off Herlagator , Victor Lloyd can . She 's so beautiful . DALE Believe me , Vickie looks far better in the movies than she does in real life . Out there they can make any dog shine . LARK But do n't you think she 's a great actress ? Remember in " Sea of Onyx " when she said , " I return your pearls . " DALE Please , she 's a half-baked affair . A facile technician who lacksHmm , how shall I say it kindly ? Who lacks all divine soulfulness . Dash and I always had to beat it out of her . It was exhausting , but in the end she generally was presentable . Forgetting , of course , her Lady Macbeth  --  a performance so unspeakably sickening that I breathed a sigh of relief when the Jeff Committee failed to file criminal complaint . LARK HmmYes . I see what you 're saying . Sometimes she could have , well , you know , moremore heart . p. 12 DALE Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , like a throbbing third breast . Remember that monstrous basket of peonies she sent me for the opening of EARTH ! And for Dash ! ( He indicates a gigantic basket of dead flowers . ) She 's always sending flowers . She 's a very loyal friend . LARK Uh-huh , right , I know . You 're always saying how she 's saying she wants to come back and do a giant benefit for the theatre . DALE I gave her her start in the theatre . We have an immutable bond . LARK Great . That 's really great ' cause we got ta get some money bad . The papers keep reporting that we have to close our doors . DALE The Red Lantern is not closing . That 's not an option . I promised Dash we would continue . I swore to him . That , this memorial , and giving up Winstons . He was holding these three fingers and I swore . LARK Oh , Jasper ! Yes . Yes . ' Cause I do n't know what I 'd do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'd do . DALE Something . You 'd do something . LARK No , I would n't . DALE Yes , you would . Stop pretending to be so helpless when you 've got all this weird power . ( Zigging his arms through the air like lightning bolts . ) Zzzz ! Zzz ! Zzz ! p. 13 LARK Only for you . I only have power for you . Sss . Sss . Sss . ( She pats her chest lovingly with the palm of her hand . ) DALE Please . LARK I 'm sorry . DALE You have to stop having those feelings for me . LARK I know . I ca n't . DALE Then keep them to yourself because they 're sick . LARK I know . It 's justI 'm sick . I 'm sick . DALE I 've told you and told you that nothing about you appeals to me . You 're not my type . It 's suffocating . LARK I know . I 'm sorry . I 'll stop . Just please do n't let me go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't . ( Kate Spoon enters with a tray . ) MULLIGAN Here 's the snack . Where 's Eddy ? LARK Outside . I  --  I 'll ( Caroleena exits out the front door . ) MULLIGAN Have you told her she 's being let go ? DALE It 's better if I wait till after the service . MULLIGAN Well , she 's very edgy . I think she suspects . p. 14 DALE Yes , I 'm sure . She 's a very good psychic . MULLIGAN Spooky . DALE I 'm thinking we should , I do n't know , demote her . Relieve her of some responsibilities . MULLIGAN A demotion would humiliate her . It 'd be too cruel . We have to let her go . DALE Well , but really . It 's so I mean what if shewhat if she MULLIGAN I 'm afraid that 's life . DALE Oh well . April is the cruelest month . MULLIGAN April ? They 're all cruel . So what about Eddy Canary ? Where has he been all these years ? DALE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutionalized in an insane asylum in Oslo for pulling out all of his teeth with a pair of pliers . ( Eddy and Caroleena enter . ) CANARY It 's lovely out there . The blue spruce . MULLIGAN Yes , we 're having dinner in the Chinese pagoda at sunset . LARK We 're eating all of Dash 's favorite foods . MULLIGAN Oysters , caviar , sun-dried tomatoes , goat cheese p. 15 LARK We 're videotaping all the food ; everyone 's dressing up . MULLIGAN Eddy , I 've made you a light snack . What beverage do you prefer ? I remember you liked bourbon . I mean , when we made our toast , it was with bourbon . CANARY Water 's fine . MULLIGAN Caroleena . LARK ( To Eddy . ) Perrier or Evian ? CANARY Either 's fine . LARK Well , Perrier comes in green bottles . CANARY Fine . ( Caroleena goes to the bar to get Eddy 's drink . Eddy starts to eat . He seems to be enjoying it . ) MULLIGAN ( To Eddy . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , smiling with dread , then resumes eating . ) MULLIGAN I read an item not long ago  --  well , actually , it was fairly long ago , five maybe ten years  --  that you were working on a great new novel while residing in Scandinavia . Norway , I believe it wasOslo . CANARY Yes , that book ; I do n't mean to boast , but it was , I think , my epiphany. p. 16 MULLIGAN Oh , we must see it ! CANARY I 'm afraid on a black dark night I burnt it all to ash . MULLIGAN You did n't ! Please ! What a tragedy . CANARY Yes . Well , no . I 'm lying . All these years I 've written nothing at all . Forgive me , I was wanting you to have a favorable opinion of me . MULLIGAN But why ? I 'm no one ; I 'm nobody . CANARY Yes , well , but I just thought it would be more pleasant . DALE Pleasant ? Pleasant ? I do n't believe Eddy Canary  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant ! It was all just Grrrrr  --  pure palpable Grrrr ! A ravishing orgy of Grrrrr ! CANARY That must have been back when I had my teeth . DALE ( Running his hands through his hair and sucking it . ) Yes , well  --  I know people change , they ca n't alwaysIt was just an observation . Something stupid to say . MULLIGAN Jasper , why do you suck on your hair ? What must it taste like ? DALE Straw . Like greasy straw . ( He nays like a horse . Caroleena brings Eddy a bottle of Perrier. ) p. 17 MULLIGAN Anyway , Eddy , I do hope you 'll write a new great book so you can adapt it into a play and do it at our theatre . LARK What theatre 's that ? What theatre 's that ? ( Jasper recklessly starts eating macaroons . ) DALE Yes , yes , like Cannibal Road , that play , that production . What a milestone . It made our name . Garnered us a reputation . I 'll never forget your portrayal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sexy as you were back then . DALE Every night Vickie and I would watch your final shaving scene from the wings . How you 'd stare at your face while slitting your own throat . CANARY I did that well . LARK What theatre do you belong to , Kate Spoon ? MULLIGAN I 've made an investment in the Red Lantern . LARK What does that mean ? DALE ( Shrugging it off . ) She gave money . LARK Oh . MULLIGAN He was sexy though . I mean back then , was n't he a very sexy man ? ( Jasper sucks his hair and shrugs. ) p. 18 MULLIGAN ( To Eddy . ) I 'll never understand why you gave up acting after just one play . CANARY I preferred real bourbon to tea . MULLIGAN Well , if you want to oversimplify CANARY If at all possible . ( Bob enters from the kitchen . ) GRAY I had a salami sandwich and some Swiss cheese on bread with mayonnaise , a Cherry Coke , potato chips and eleven Oreos . ( A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GRAY I want to contribute my share . DALE Pay Kate Spoon . LARK I brought things too . MULLIGAN Let him eat for free . Eddy Canary 's eating for free . GRAY I want to pay . Here 's three dollars . ( Bob gives the money to Caroleena who has extended her hand . Bob exits out the front door . ) MULLIGAN ( Remarking after Bob . ) You should n't have stuffed yourself . Dinner 's not far off and everyone 's stuffing themselves . ( To Jasper . ) Look at you . I thought you were n't hungry . p. 19 DALE I 'm not . MULLIGAN Then why are you eating macaroons ? DALE Eating is not always indicative of hunger  --  oh ye of the literal , linear mind . ( Caroleena laughs . ) MULLIGAN I know you think I 'm not artistic . I do n't go around barefoot slurping my hair , and you assume I 'm not artistic but I am . In my heart I know I am . DALE I was n't suggesting  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the same , I 'm not hungry . MULLIGAN It does n't matter . No one has ever believed in me . I 'm used to it by now . I 've always had to rely on my own inner strength . DALE I  --  really  --  whatever . MULLIGAN Yes , it 's silly . Anyway it 's time to start the final dinner preparations . We ca n't miss the sunset ; it 's Dash 's last . ( Kate Spoon exits to the kitchen . ) LARK She was n't supposed to be here . She was n't supposed to come . All of us here , Dash wanted us here . Us and Victor Lloyd , but not her . She drove all the way from St. Louis to visit his hospital room and he told me to tell her he was feeding . DALE We 'll edit her out . Why do you think I keep telling her to stand on the outskirts ? p. 20 LARK She should n't be here at all . DALE Fine . Why do n't you go tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's not welcome . Tell her to get out . LARK Okay , okay . I 'm sorry . I just  --  what she said to you about eating macaroons MULLIGAN ( Offstage . ) Caroleena , could you come videotape me preparing the hors d'oeuvres ? LARK Alright . Coming ! ( To Jasper . ) I 'm sorry , okay ? I 'm sorry . Ssss . ( Caroleena exits . ) CANARY Where 's Vickie ? DALE She 's not coming ? CANARY Is n't this her cottage ? DALE Yes . Dash always wanted to see it . Victor sent us pictures , but she 's always so busy and he never got up . So he asked to have his ashes scattered up here around the lake . CANARY I have to say , and this is probably a lie , but I was hoping to see her . To see Victor , Vickie , Vick . DALE Here 's a picture . CANARY Yes , they 've changed her nose . DALE Her profile is destroyed . p. 21 CANARY I 'd like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette ? DALE I quit . I 'm on nicotine gum . It 's hideous . ( Bob enters from the front door carrying a box . ) GRAY I found this lizard in the pagoda . It looks hurt . It might be dead . ( Eddy looks at the lizard . He pokes it with his finger . ) CANARY I think it 's dead . GRAY You sure ? DALE Here , let me see that . ( Jasper takes the box and vigorously shakes it back and forth . ) Yes , it 's dead . p. 22 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE II Victor Lloyd , forties , a willowy woman with sunglasses and unkempt hair piled under a purple hat , enters through the front door . She lugs a shoulder bag and staggers with exhaustion . She is startled to find her front door is unlocked and even more unnerved by the odd assortment of stage props gathered in her living room . LLOYD No . Oh please . Really ( She reacts to an artificial donkey 's head with personal horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door , oblivious to Victor . Caroleena is dressed in a yellow evening gown . She wears a hair extension decorated with stars . Tears are welling in her eyes . She clutches her chest gasping for breath . ) LARK It 's not fair . It 's not fair . I was on Dash 's list ! My name was on it ; hers was not . Now she puts everyone 's name on his cake except for mine . My name should be on his cake . I wanted to be on his cake ! ( Caroleena spots Victor . ) Oh , no . You'reHi . LLOYD Hi . LARK They said you were n't coming . LLOYD ( Ever hopeful . ) Was n't this last week ? LARK No , now . He wanted to be strewn in April . p. 23 LLOYD April ? When 's April ? LARK Tomorrow it starts . LLOYD I 'm confused . I thoughtLast week I sent flowers . LARK Yes , they 're big . They died . Here .

Believe me , I do n't care . LARK You do have a large heart . Very big . I 'm Caroleena Lark . I work at RLT . I have a formidable acting gift and hope someday to work on the stage , but for now I 'm a Jill of all trades . I build sets , hang lights , do maintenance , box office , props , concessions , lobby displays . I 'm indispensable to the operation . ( Kate Spoon enters with Eddy Canary . They are carrying the cutout of Dash . Kate is dressed in an evening gown . ) MULLIGAN ( To Eddy , about the cutout . ) Careful , careful . Easy now . ( Spotting Caroleena . ) Caroleena , I did not deliberately exclude you from Dash 's cake . It was an honest mistake . I simply forgot about you completely . ( She sees Victor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's here ! Why , look how you look . Just like a person . Your home is wonderful , the perfect setting , I adore the simplicity . Anyway , you do n't remember me . I 'm Kate Spoon . I took classes from Dash with you many years ago . Dash threw an apple core at me . Is n't this amazing . now everyone 's here from the original cast of Cannibal Road . p. 24 LLOYD What ? Not Eddy Canary ? MULLIGAN But this is Eddy Canary . ( Kate Spoon points to Eddy who is busy at the bar . ) LLOYD Really ? MULLIGAN Of course . Eddy , tell her it 's you . I 'll get Jasper . LARK Let me get Jasper . I saw her first . MULLIGAN Jasper ! LARK I came upon her ! ( Kate Spoon and Caroleena race out the front door .

Well , I think , and yet it 's more complex naturally . But we were , Victor and I , at one point together and there was , I would say , a love . My wife found out and ran off to the Yucatan . I followed her because she only had one leg . Unfortunately , when I found her , the other leg was gone as well . After some time , she died unpleasantly .

DALE It frightens me how I do n't need love . LLOYD Whatever happened between you and Dash ? You were the perfect ones . DALE It was all stupid , stupid , stupid , stupid . LLOYD Of course , but what ? p. 39 DALE A very simple act . I feed my dog Snags a piece of linguine from the table . In a Rasputanesque rage , Dash cleared the table shattering my grandmother 's wedding china . He said he was living in domestic hell , but I think it was something deeper . You do n't leave a love of fifteen years over a flung piece of pasta . All the same , I got rid of my dog Snags . LLOYD Poor Snags . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinstate myself with Dash .

I remember sending flowers . DALE Actually , it was quite a formidable disaster . I 'm only speaking financially and critically , of course . LLOYD Oh well . DALE Exactly .

LARK ( To Bob . ) Look at you ! Your mood T-shirt 's turned brown . When I gave him the shirt , it was a light neutral beige , now it 's mud brown . GRAY Maybe I started to sweat . LARK Brown indicates depression . You must be depressed . GRAY No . LARK It could be subliminal . Do you think it 's subliminal ? GRAY No . LARK Hmm . Let me see your palm . I 'll unravel things .

GRAY What does that mean ? LARK You do n't have to pay for the mixed nuts . I purchased them and you do n't have to pay . They 're expensive , mixed nuts . Much more so than just all peanuts . GRAY I bet black 's not good . Maybe I 'm sweating . Maybe it 's my sweat . ( Kate Spoon enters through the front door with cymbals in her hands . She crashes them together . ) MULLIGAN Oh no , no ! Tear the shorn head , rip nails through the folded cheeks . ( Kate Spoon crashes the cymbals once again for dramatic emphasis . ) Hecuba is resurrected . Fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutout of Dash . ) When he sees me tomorrow he will throw rose petals from heaven . LARK I do n't think so . MULLIGAN She doubts . She doubts . What do you think , Jasper ? DALE ( About Victor . ) Her nails look wonderful . Let 's have champagne . ( Jasper descends from the tree to seek champagne. ) p. 45 MULLIGAN I think I 've proved it . I think I 've shown . You 're never too old to make dreams come true . If you just keep wishing and working , anything is possible . LARK You could never be a brain surgeon .

I 'll get it . ( Timothy exits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Jasper starts pouring . ) GRAY Did you ever notice when you go inside a grocery store it gets colder ? CANARY Yes , I have . I 've noticed that . GRAY I think it 's because they have to keep the produce cold , and then they 've got the freezer section and that 's really cold . I try to remember , but I usually do n't , to bring a sweater . ( Jasper fills Caroleena 's glass with champagne. ) p. 47 LARK You 're letting me go . DALE ( To Kate Spoon . ) You told her . MULLIGAN It 's her . I never did . LARK It was a mistake . You told me to mop the floors and I forgot , but I thought I had time in act one and I could finish it all up before intermission . But that little man left early ; he did n't finish the act ; I think maybe he did n't like your play . I do n't know why ; I thought it was good , I thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the audience has arrived , any idiot knows . MULLIGAN It 's not good policy . It gives a bad impression .

MULLIGAN It was a board decision . LARK What board ? MULLIGAN We have a new board . LARK But I ca n't live without it . I ca n't live without the Red Lantern Theatre . Please .

Still , oh , Eddy , Eddy , Ed , why did you ever come here ? CANARY To see you , to see you , to see you . I think that 's why . There was a mention  --  I heard your name and I rememberedI remembered loving you . Strange ache , like cutting a red pear with a sharp blade : hurt , bite , juice . LLOYD What do you want from me ? CANARY What can I have ? ( Bob enters from left , heading for the kitchen . ) GRAY I 've come back for a snack . I 've come back for a snack . ( Bob exits to the kitchen . A pause .

When we were kids , it was chocolate pie with meringue . No , that was my favorite and Dad 's favorite . I guess I do n't remember yours . ( Bob sits eating his brownie . ) ( The lights fade to black. ) @x Victor 's woods around the lake . A small stage has been erected . The cutout of Dash has been placed upon it . A large fantasy tree grows near the stage . A tightrope wire runs from a tree branch to a metal pole . Makeshift seating , including wooden stools , a tree stump , a plush ottoman , and a wicker bench create the audience area . Dawn is breaking . Kate Spoon is on stage practicing different poses to end her speech . She wears a Greek robe and sandals . Timothy sits in the audience working on his computer with the cellular phone and video camera near to him . MULLIGAN Which pose for the end ? Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She does three poses . ) Timothy , look up ! Look at me ! ( She starts the poses again . ) ( Jasper enters .

This video 's for our archives ; it 's vital because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . He 's a professional . HAROLD I do n't understand this ? I 've shot three feature films . They 've all grossed millions ; I do n't understand . MULLIGAN Yes , yes , we know . DALE Fine , then , fine . I 'm sure you 're very capable . Excuse me , please . It 's just no one is here ; the sun is rising ; Dash wanted dawn , the dawn light . ( He spots another bug and stomps it . ) Horrors ! MULLIGAN I 'm so unphotogenic . I do n't take a good picture . I always photograph like an older person . Like I 'm not young anymore . DALE ( Stomping spiders . ) Victor has a very serious spider problem . HAROLD Brown Recluse , I believe . p. 55 DALE It 's definitely a siege . MULLIGAN Will you stop ! Will you stop killing them ? ! Really , stop ! DALE Why should I ? MULLIGAN We are all God 's creatures . DALE That I do n't doubt . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you certainly are no St. Francis of Assisi . No , you are no St. Francis of Assisi . Goodness , I am always saying things that are so funny . If I would just spend fifteen minutes a day writing down the funny things I say , I 'd have a book of a hundred funny things in a very short time . ( Jasper responds by stomping more spiders . Victor appears from under the platform . She wears her clothes from the night before . She is covered with vines and leaves . ) LLOYD Will you stop that fucking stomping ? ! Jesus , are you trying to split my skull ? ! DALE What are youWhere 's Eddy ? LLOYD I need coffee . I must have caffeine . MULLIGAN Here , I have a thermos and croissants .

MULLIGAN ( Passing out strawberries . ) Strawberries , strawberries , strawberries , strawberries , strawberries . LLOYD This is very surreal . ( Jasper discovers Eddy under the stage . Eddy crawls out in shameful disrepair . He 's bruised and bloodied and covered with filth . ) DALE There he is . Eddy . Jesus , shit . HAROLD ( To Victor . ) He was down there with you ? He was down there ? MULLIGAN Look at you ! Oh , look at you ! Why have you been out here rolling in the dirt ? CANARY Ah , dirt , dirt , dirt ! Dirt is a masterpiece ! MULLIGAN This is not good .

GRAY I think sheI think she 's dead . DALE This is a very bad joke . GRAY I found this letter . It 's all about , " how it is now time to die . " DALE Where 'd you find that ? GRAY In the kitchen . Crumpled in a ball on the kitchen floor . DALE ( Taking the note . ) I wrote this . This is mine . For God 's sake , you should n't be snooping through crumpled pieces of paper , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do such a thing ? LLOYD Yes ? God . How ? DALE What ? It 's nothing . I write these all the time . I wrote several last night . It 's how I deal with depression . Does n't everyone do it ? I thought everyone did it ? ( A marked silence. ) p. 59 LLOYD May I see ? DALE It 's not one of my better efforts . MULLIGAN May I read it next ? DALE No , only her . LLOYD This is very pessimistic . MULLIGAN I do n't understand why you would write such a thing . It borders on morbid behavior . LLOYD You want to be sprinkled up here with Dash . DALE I thought he would n't mind . MULLIGAN You never know . Dash was very unpredictable , hurling apple cores left and right . LLOYD Well , it 's all beside the point . Jasper 's not dying or anything of the sort for several thousand years . I 'm sure Dash would agree . ( Suddenly , a host of pink petals drifts down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) DALE Why , look ! LLOYD My God . It 's a sign . DALE A sign from Dash . CANARY Petals . MULLIGAN What ? No . It 's not reallyit was just some petals  --  the wind . p. 60 HAROLD ( Factually . ) There is no wind . CANARY Falling . DALE No , it was a sign . It was Dash .

It 's really CANARY Blossoms . LLOYD Marvelous . GRAY Wow ! DALE It 's you ! It 's you ! Dash , my Dash ! HAROLD No , it 's the girl in the green shoes . She 's up there in the tree . DALE What ?

CANARY Bravo ! Bravo ! Take a bow . p. 61 GRAY I thoughtI did n't know . Gosh . ( Caroleena takes several bows . ) DALE I have one thing to say to you . This is passive aggressive . Passive fucking aggressive . God , look at the light . The sun . The sun . This is  --  we 've wasted No further diversions will be tolerated ! We must begin ! MULLIGAN I 'll pass out the programs . LLOYD Has M.J. spoken to my agent ? HAROLD First thing this morning he 's calling her . It will all be settled . ( Kate Spoon is passing out programs . ) LLOYD What 's this ? MULLIGAN A portrait of Dash as Banquo 's ghost . LLOYD ( To Eddy . ) What is she ? The Johnny Appleseed of bad taste ? CANARY Grr . Grr . DALE Bob , Bob , Bob , it 's really not complicated .

GRAY I thought you were  --  I thought you had gone . p. 62 MULLIGAN ( To Timothy . ) Use all of your skills to give it some real umph ! And remember , make me look like a movie star . ( Jasper bangs the cymbals once more . ) DALE ( To the cutout of Dash . ) Ladies and gentlemen , Dash Grey , a legend ! ( He applauds ; the others rise to their feet and cheer . ) DALE But say no more , for the man would not wish it . His wishes were , and I quote ( He reads from a piece of paper . ) " At my final celebration , dear friends , I implore you to eschew all sad speeches , clever anecdotes , and dreary eulogies . Instead , I crave a colorful circus for a departed ringmaster . Act , dance , sing , swing on ropes , play your pipes but , above everything , I beseech you to revel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that I might sleep in peace knowing my troubled life has ended with a song . " ( Jasper gently folds the speech up and speaks to his audience . ) Thus let us begin with a tune . A tune Victor and I performed many moons ago from my very first musical , Cookie 's Cooked . In retrospect , I realize this is not my most sophisticated , nor is it my most accomplished work . Yet I know it held a special place in Dash 's heart , for I dedicated it to him all those many years ago when we were young and full of hope and did not know what times our lives would hold . p. 63 LLOYD I remember  --  I remember Dash once saying to me  --  " Music is often the one thing that makes life bearable .

To make everything exactly the way he wanted . LARK ( As Dash , his energy re-emerging . ) Where 's Earl Bell ? DALE What ? LARK ( As Dash , gaining strength . ) Where 's Earl Bell ?

LARK ( As Dash . ) It was abominable , no one came , critics hated it , Asians picketed , costumes and set pieces were forcibly repossessed due to your mad extravagance .

Why , I did n't know the theatre was having financial difficulties . LARK ( As Dash , gaining strength to confront Victor . ) How would you know ? We never see you or hear from you .

I remember I did n't want to be distracted at that time , andI never saw you again , that 's true . Oh , I 'm such an empty , horrible person and I do n't understand how it happened .
