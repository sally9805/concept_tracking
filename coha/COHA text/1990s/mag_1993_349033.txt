Father Dan is homosexual , like nearly every other character in Jeffrey , Paul Rudnick 's rollicking AIDS play . Not sex-mad , exactly  --  sex-nutty . " Do you know what it 's like in that confessional ? " he rhetorically asks Jeffrey , a Manhattan actor-waiter whom the priest has vamped in St. Patrick 's Cathedral . " ' Father , I 've had impure thoughts about my soccer coach . ' Where are the Polaroids ? What am I , a mind reader ? Say six Hail Marys and bring me his shorts ! " <P> Our hero is no less shocked and outraged by this catechism of concupiscence than a middle-class Manhattan playgoer might be . But because the plague years have forced Jeffrey to retreat from sex , or even from expressions of love , he is desperate for wisdom from any source . And  --  surprise !  --  Father Dan has some for him . " Of course life sucks , " the cleric says . " It always will . So how dare you not make the most of it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refusal of joy ! Of a corsage and a kiss ! " <P> The speech is vintage Rudnick  --  a party wine with a bouquet of sentiment and the kick of rude truth . To the tart social wit of gay writers from Oscar Wilde to Joe Orton he adds irrepressible high spirits  --  a tonic when so much of literature has the terminal glums . This Renaissance jester is a yea-sayer , a missionary for joy . " Usually when I 'm asked why I write , " says Rudnick , 35 , " I reply , ' To avoid a day job . ' But the truth is that there are people in real life I want to honor . It 's easy to write about despair . It 's tough to present optimism realistically and appealingly . I think it 's a worthwhile goal to help people find genuine pleasure without feeling like fools . So I do try to celebrate . It does n't get real Samuel Beckett in Paul Rudnickland . " <P> Just now , Rudnickland is a rewarding place to be . Jeffrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an off-Broadway hit , with regional productions and a possible movie sale in the offing . Playgoers may be shocked by the NC-17 dialogue , but that is just a test . " People in the audience often look fearful , " Rudnick says , " that the actors will be coming down the aisles to . . . date them , or something . They think , ' I ca n't take this , ' and then about 20 seconds later they 're laughing . " <P> He has made his mark , if not his name , in movies too . Sister Act , the Whoopi Goldberg comedy for which Rudnick wrote the original script , was last summer 's boffo surprise . Other hands diluted the screenplay , which Rudnick eventually signed with the pseudonym Joseph Howard ; but the movie grossed $140 million , so now , " although there is no Joseph Howard , his career is soaring . " Rudnick 's uncredited rewrite of The Addams Family ( $115 million ) is " the reason that movie was a hit , " says Scott Rudin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rudnick to write the sequel , Addams Family Values , due out in November . Today , with class and mass smashes , Rudnick is hotter than sex in the ' 70s.
