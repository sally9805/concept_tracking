Int . ALICE 's Room  --  Night A little bit of moonlight coming in through the tiny window might make a highlight here and there but that 's about all . Words begin to crawl across the screen . Of good family , albeit one of modest means , she was a comely young woman and not without prospects . Therefore it was at once heartbreaking and astonishing to her mother that she would enter into marriage with William Munny , a known thief and murderer , a man of notoriously vicious and intemperate disposition . We can hear STRAWBERRY ALICE and DAVEY BUNTING breathing heavily and the bed creaking . Written words crawl : They were married in St. Louis in 1870 and they traveled north to Kansas where he engaged in farming and swine husbandry . DAVEY and ALICE are picking up speed now , breathing faster and even snorting a little , and it 's cold as Jesus in Nebraska in the winter , so when the blanket slips , Alice snarls and gasps . &nbsp; ALICEThe blanket , for chrissake , cowboy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . one for each whore . . . behind Greely 's Beer Garden and Billiards , and the walls are just boards , so you can hear what 's happening in the other rooms and right now , from DELILAH 's room , you can hear a high-pitched , merry little giggle and that 's important . Written words crawl : She bore him two children in the eight years of their marriage and when she died , it was not at his hands as her mother might have expected , but of smallpox . That was 1878 . &nbsp; DELILAH ( O.S. ) . No , please . . . No , no goddamn you . ALICE and DAVEY have stopped fucking and started listening , but they do n't move . Written words crawl : It was n't until 1881 . . . three years later . . . that a cowboy named MIKE cut up a whore in Big Whiskey , Nebraska , in the Niobrara River country .

DELILAH 's Room  --  Night DELILAH is backed up against the wall , her face bleeding , and she is throwing the contents of her chamber pot on MIKE , who is advancing on her with an open barlow knife , and DAVEY busts into the room naked and ALICE follows him and PEOPLE are shouting in other rooms . &nbsp; MIKE ( wiping shit off himself ) . Hold the bitch , Davey , hold her . The one coal oil lamp in the room gives off just enough light that you can make all this out .

DAVEY is reluctant about the whole thing but he is afraid of MIKE and he gets behind DELILAH and grabs her . &nbsp; DAVEYWh-what you gon na do , Mike ? MIKE is doing it now and DELILAH is screaming while he carves her face with the barlow knife and blood is all over , splashing on DAVEY , and DAVEY , who is just a kid , after all , nineteen with a big shock of unruly red hair and innocent blue eyes , is horrified . &nbsp; MIKEThieving cunt , I 'll . . . &nbsp; DAVEYMike , do n't , Jesus , do n't . . . &nbsp; ALICESkinny !

Angle on SKINNY DUBOIS Standing there in the doorway , his nasty face eaten with smallpox scars and he is looking at DELILAH , who is a fountain of blood , looking at her coldly , and looking down at the melee on the floor , and pointing the big Navy Colt in his hand , he says : &nbsp; SKINNYGet offa her , asshole . And he says it so cold and with such authority that everything goes quiet . Ext .

You gon na hang ' em , Little Bill ? Int . Barroom  --  Night DAVEY sitting naked on the floor of the barroom and MIKE is sitting near him , still in his leggings and both men are shivering because they are fifteen feet from the potbellied stove , where CLYDE is standing watching them . It is a big room , with a crude bar and four tables and some moose and elk heads on the wall . The door near the rear where it says BILLIARD ROOM leads not to a billiard room but to the six little " rooms " that are the whorehouse and now you can hear DELILAH groaning from there . And LITTLE BILL enters from the back of the barroom , stooping to pass through the doorway under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge and ominous . Some say he acquired the bearskin by staring the bear to death and others say he drowned the animal in spit . Anyhow , he 's big with a drooping moustache and he is sucking on his church warden 's clay pipe and you know he is n't scared of anything . And the two cowboys are scared to death not just shivering from the cold , and BILL just looks down at them and sucks on his pipe and ALICE comes in from the back way , too , and then SKINNY and a couple of the whores gather in the doorway . &nbsp; LITTLE BILLClyde , step across to the German 's an ' fetch up one of his bullwhips .

Greely 's Porch  --  Angle on NED 's Body  --  Night In the upright coffin in the flickering light of a torch standing next to it and , of course , NED looks bad and the crudely scrawled sign over the coffin says , " This is what happens to assassins around here . " Int . Barroom  --  Angle on LITTLE BILL  --  Night In the crowded bar and he is shouting to make himself heard over the din . &nbsp; LITTLE BILLAll right , I 'm gon na say just one more time so it 's all clear an ' then do n't ask me no more . The place is packed with tired , dusty men and they are not really jubilant so much as they are excited by the hysteria of events . &nbsp; LITTLE BILL ( continuing ) . Now each of you that posse 'd today has got one drink comin ' off the county budget . . . &nbsp; THURSTONYahoo . &nbsp; LITTLE BILL . . .

An ' we 're pullin ' out early tomorrow an ' chase these fellas clear to Texas so I would n't spend much of your own money . There is a general whoop and hubbub as LITTLE BILL turns back to his conversation at the bar with CHARLEY , FATTY , CLYDE , ANDY and W.W. BEAUCHAMP . &nbsp; LITTLE BILL ( continuing ) . Now if we divide up into four parties an ' hit all the farms an ' trails in a circle , we 're bound to find some one who seen them skunks an ' . . . LITTLE BILL is suddenly conscious of his own loud voice in a sudden silence that has swept the bar like a brushfire and , turning , he sees what everybody is staring at . MUNNY , with his 10-gauge shotgun leveled from the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking a couple of sideways steps to get the door behind his back and sweeping the twin barrels in an ominous arc , he surveys the scene . &nbsp; MUNNY ( a little drunk ) . Which fucker owns this shithole ? Nobody says a thing . SKINNY stares pop-eyed from behind the bar and the sweat starts on his forehead and LITTLE BILL is thinking coolly and everybody else is swallowing hard and looking at the shotgun . &nbsp; MUNNY ( continuing ; to FATTY ) . You there , fat man , speak up . FATTY gulps and then SKINNY screws up his courage and steps from behind the bar and gives it every bit of dignity his fear will permit .  --  54  --  &nbsp; SKINNYI . . . I own this establishment . I bought it from Greely for a thous . . . &nbsp; MUNNY ( to the men round SKINNY ) . Better step clear , boys . And SKINNY looks from side to side as people step away from him and he wants to say something desperately , he wants to live , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Bah-whoom ! MUNNY fires and smoke belches and . . . SKINNY is blown back against the wall and he falls to the floor a bloody mess and . . . LITTLE BILL is reaching for the Spencer which is leaning against the bar near his leg but he freezes because . . . MUNNY has turned the shotgun on him and MUNNY sees NED 's Spencer there and his eyes show how he feels about it . For a moment , while the smoke clears , the bar is silent , and there are nervous glances cast at the bloody body of SKINNY , but LITTLE BILL keeps his eyes on MUNNY . &nbsp; LITTLE BILL ( continuing ) . Well , sir You are a cowardly son of a bitch , because you have just shot down an unarmed man . It has become a very formal moment and there are , figuratively speaking , only two people in the room , MUNNY and LITTLE BILL . . . and W.W. BEAUCHAMP is watching them , scared to death , but this is it , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saloon . &nbsp; MUNNY ( the shotgun pointed right at LITTLE BILL ) . He should have armed himself if he was gon na decorate his saloon with the body of my friend . &nbsp; LITTLE BILLI guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri , killer of women and children . &nbsp; MUNNY ( a little drunkenly ) . I have done that . . . killed women and children . . . I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an ' now I have come to kill you , Little Bill , for what you done to Ned . ( to the others ) Now step aside , boys . And as the DEPUTIES nervously move aside , LITTLE BILL helps to isolate himself by stepping forward boldly . &nbsp; LITTLE BILLHe 's got one barrel left , gentlemen . After he has used it , pull your pistols and shoot him down like the cowardly , drunken scoundrel he is . LITTLE BILL looks back at MUNNY bravely and . . . MUNNY looks down the barrel at LITTLE BILL and after a tense moment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is a misfire and what happens next happens in maybe five seconds as all hell breaks loose . &nbsp; LITTLE BILL ( drawing ) . Misfire ! Kill the son of a bitch ! And LITTLE BILL aims carefully and . . . MUNNY hurls the shotgun at him and . . . Blam ! . . . LITTLE BILL fires wildly as the shotgun hits him and . . . CLYDE has his pistol out and is pointing it at MUNNY and . . . MUNNY is pulling his pistol from his own belt and he drops to one knee and . . .  --  55  --  Blam ! . . . CLYDE fires and misses and . . . LITTLE BILL is about to squeeze the trigger when . . . Blam ! . . . MUNNY shoots him and . . . Blam ! . . . LITTLE BILL shoots just as he is hit in the chest and . . . Blam ! Blam ! . . . FATTY fires wildly and . . . MUNNY is aiming , too , and Blam ! . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Blam ! . . . Blam ! . . . FATTY is n't even aiming while . . . ANDY aims carefully , he can kill MUNNY but . . . MUNNY turns and points his weapon at ANDY and . . . Instead of firing , ANDY panics and tries to turn his body sideways to ward off the blow and . . . Blam ! . . . MUNNY fires and . . . ANDY gets it high in the ribcage and . . . CHARLEY turns and runs for the back and . . . Blam ! Blam ! . . . FATTY is backing up and firing from the hip and then he turns to run and . . . MUNNY aims deliberately from one knee and Blam ! . . . FATTY goes down , shot in the back . . . And suddenly . . . there is a terrible silence that is broken only by the awful , dying groans of CLYDE and the coughing of the BYSTANDERS hiding behind tables and chairs in the thick black smoke and . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol and looking through the thick smoke for someone to shoot , but it seems there are no threats left . &nbsp; MUNNYEvery asshole that does n't want to get shot , best clear out the back quick . And they scramble over each other , dashing toward the billiard room , and MUNNY stands up and looks around and he looks at CLYDE who is groaning , his face covered with blood , and everybody else , LITTLE BILL , ANDY , and FATTY are still , and then FATTY seems to move and MUNNY levels his pistol and what happens is W.W. crawls out from half-under FATTY and W.W. is covered with blood and he is shaking like a leaf . &nbsp; W.W.I . . . I . . . think I 'm . . . shot . &nbsp; MUNNYYou ai n't shot . &nbsp; W.W. ( seeing the pistol ) . P-p-p-please , I 'm not armed . As MUNNY lowers the pistol , W.W. looks around . &nbsp; W.W. ( continuing ) . M-m-my G-god . You killed Little Bill . &nbsp; MUNNY ( suspicious ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c-c-carry arms . I 'm . . . a writer . &nbsp; MUNNYA writer ? What do you write . . . letters an ' such ? &nbsp; W.W.B-b-books. ( amazed ) You . . . you killed five men . . . single-handed . &nbsp; MUNNY ( wearily ) . Yeah . MUNNY walks over to the bar , keeping his eye suspiciously on W.W. , and reaches for a bottle with his left hand . The hand is shaking like palsy and he tilts the bottle and drinks sloppily with effort , the pistol still in his right hand .  --  56  --  &nbsp; W.W.Wh-wh-who did you kill first ? &nbsp; MUNNYHuh ? &nbsp; W.W. ( reciting ) . Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers , the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first . &nbsp; MUNNY ( drinking ) . Yeah ? Unnoticed on the floor , LITTLE BILL is conscious , though blood is coming out of his mouth and he has been written off . One hand is shifting on his pistol and he can hear CLYDE moaning sporadically . &nbsp; W.W.Little Bill told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? On the floor , Little Bill is fighting for consciousness , fingering his pistol . &nbsp; MUNNYI was lucky in the order . ( bitterly ) I always been lucky killin ' folks . &nbsp; W.W. ( absorbed ) . Who was next ? Clyde ? Or was it . . . ? &nbsp; MUNNY ( suddenly ominous , pistol pointing ) . I could tell you who was last , mister . W.W. 's eyes pop as he gets the idea and he backs up fast , and then he turns and bolts out the back , and watching him go , MUNNY turns his back on the fallen body of LITTLE BILL . LITTLE BILL , on the floor , raises up his pistol in his shaking hand and aims at MUNNY 's back , maybe six feet away , and he is shaking bad as he draws the hammer back and . . . MUNNY hears the click and he turns and sees LITTLE BILL aiming , but it is too late and . . . Blam ! Smoke and fire from LITTLE BILL 's pistol and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol falls with a bang . &nbsp; MUNNY ( continuing ) . Missed again , asshole . And MUNNY steps over to him and kicks the pistol away from LITTLE BILL 's outstretched hand . LITTLE BILL is bleeding from the mouth , having taken a shot in the lung , and he is very weak and all he can do is look up at MUNNY and speak weakly . &nbsp; LITTLE BILLI do n't . . . deserve this . . . to die this way . I was . . . building a house . &nbsp; MUNNY ( aiming his pistol point blank ) . " Deserve " do n't mean shit , Little Bill . &nbsp; LITTLE BILL ( the pistol in his face ) . I 'll see you . . . in hell , you three-fingered asshole . Blam ! MUNNY shoots LITTLE BILL and then he looks around and CLYDE is still groaning and that is the only sound . Then , suddenly , he is all business . He walks quickly over to CLYDE and shoots him once with the Spencer and the groaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and pokes around in the pockets and pulls out some shells for the Spencer . He shoves those in his pocket and he goes to the bar and picks up the bottle of whiskey and walks over to the door . Standing to one side , he kicks it open . Then he sets down the rifle and the bottle and starts to reload the Schofield and while he loads it , he shouts out the door . &nbsp; MUNNYI 'm comin ' outta here . . . an ' any fucker I see out there , I 'm gon na kill him . . . an ' any fucker takes a shot at me , I ai n't just gon na kill him , but I 'm gon na kill his wife an ' all his friends an ' burn his fucking house , hear ? The pistol is loaded and MUNNY sticks it in his belt and he takes a long pull on the whiskey bottle and wipes  --  57  --  the dribble from his chin . Then , he picks up the rifle in the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's  --  Night The street , and it is dark and quiet , shadowy buildings , the knot of tethered horses , a couple of torches stuck in the ground , sputtering . &nbsp; MUNNY ( O.S. ) . Nobody better shoot on account of I 'm as mean as I say . . . maybe meaner . I am a damn badman an ' you will not find a worse one in hell . And MUNNY steps out of the door warily , and looks around and all he sees are the shadowy buildings and all he hears are his own boots on the wooden porch . Glancing nervously at the dark buildings ' blank stares he walks past the upright coffin where the waxy face of NED stares gruesomely in the light of the flickering torch and he gives it a glance , wanting to say he 's sorry , but the idea is ludicrous and he steps off the porch and walks toward the white mare . Ext . Alleyway  --  Night W.W. BEAUCHAMP and CHARLEY HECKER and GERMANY JOE crouched in the alleyway between two buildings across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see MUNNY mounting his horse . &nbsp; GERMANY JOE ( whispering ) . Go ahead , shoot him . CHARLEY just shakes his head and offers the rifle to GERMANY JOE . And GERMANY JOE does n't want it . &nbsp; GERMANY JOE ( continuing ) . I endt no dehpoody . W.W. is watching MUNNY 's unbelievably awkward and prolonged mounting procedure and he ca n't believe it , he ca n't believe what the Old West is like and it shows on his face . Ext . Main Street  --  Night MUNNY riding down the dark , lonely street at a trot and he starts to shout at the top of his lungs : &nbsp; MUNNYYou boys better bury old NED right . . . and you better not carve up nor otherwise harm no whores . . . or I will come back an ' kill more sonsabitches , hear ? And there are tears running down MUNNY 's cheeks . Section Details Ext . Sod Hut  --  Day Daylight and PENNY sweeping in the doorway of MUNNY 's sod hut in Kansas .

Angle on MUNNY MUNNY walking across the field , leading the mare . He is covered with dust and heavily stubbled from the trip . PENNY dashes up to him and throws her arms around him and he is overjoyed , but he does n't have any way to express it except through awkwardness and embarrassment . &nbsp; MUNNY ( fondly ) .

Hog Pens  --  Angle on WILL  --  Day Working in the hog pens in back , concentrating on the job . &nbsp; MUNNYPlace looks good .

Grave  --  Day The grave of Claudia under the trees and MUNNY walks up to it and maybe we hear music or maybe just the wind , but the words begin to crawl across screen , supered : They were married in St. Louis in 1870 and they traveled north to Kansas where he engaged in farming and swine husbandry . She bore him two children in the eight years of their marriage and when she died , it was not at his hands as her mother might have expected , but of smallpox . Angle on MUNNY We are looking at him by now and there is nothing easy on his face , no big emotions , he is just looking at the grave . Written words crawl across screen : Some years later , Mrs. Ansonia Feathers made the arduous journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her only daughter . Angle on grave We are looking at the stone now and the words continue : William Munny had long since sold the place and disappeared with the  --  59  --  children . . . some said to San Francisco where it was rumored he prospered as a dry goods merchant under a different name . Close on Eyes of WILLIAM MUNNY The eyes of the husband and the pig farmer and the man who shot down five men in the Big Whiskey saloon . Written words : And there was nothing on the stone to explain to Mrs. Feathers why her only daughter had married a known thief and murderer , a man of notoriously vicious and intemperate disposition .
