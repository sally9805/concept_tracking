It was late afternoon when we climbed into a gondola . Feletia remained in back to practice conversational Italian with the gondolier . She had tied her bronze hair with a red scarf and was peeling a peach . I sat in front of her , too hot to talk . Our two daughters , dressed in blue , perched like small birds on the middle seat , straw hats with matching ribbons on their blond heads . Angela , who moments before had been hot and cranky , placidly nibbled a cookie . Penny dipped her hand in the dirty canal . Gwendolyn , the children 's young nurse , sat in front , her face shaded under an orange and pink parasol . Over how many centuries , I wondered , have exhausted travelers been gently propelled into the theater of Venice , motley players on an ancient stage ? <p> It was bright-eyed Angela who first saw my friend waving from the terrace of the hotel . Penny not to be outdone , jumped to her feet , fanning the air with her hat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , the parasol fell over the side , a flash of color in the grey tide . <p> I had a premonition of disasters to come . " Do you think this was a bad idea , Feletia ? " <p> " Of course , it was n't . The girls will behave , if that 's what you mean . " Feletia gazed fondly at the children . " It 's such a pity Sally could n't have a child . " <p> " It might have been Roger , you know . Cancer cells may have been lurking in his body for years . " <p> " What is cancer , Daddy ? " Penny asked . <p> " A disease-a sickness , " I said . " But you are never to mention the word in front of Mr. Train . Do you understand ? " <p> " Why ? " <p> " He came to Europe to have fun . He does n't want to be reminded of . . . of his illness . " <p> " We came to have fun , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Do n't be silly , " said Gwendolyn , raising her head from a drawing pad , " it 's been lots of fun . " <p> Penny made a face as if she 'd eaten a sour grape . <p> " Roger ! " I called , cupping my hands . " We made it ! " <p> My friend was standing at the top of the landing . To my amazement , his tall , gangly frame was enfolded in a black cape . As we drew closer , I could see the collar filigreed with gold and a flash of crimson lining . Over his high forehead was perched a tricorn . His wife , stocky with short cropped hair , wore an orange linen dress . Behind them , a waiter held a tray of glasses . <p> " My friends , welcome ! " Roger shouted , his deep hollow voice booming over the water . <p> He strode down the broad stone steps to meet us , an imposing sight in his cape , and with his hawk-like nose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing , however , under the masquerade I saw the face of a stricken man . I had not seen my friend for over a year-the year of his treatment-and was shocked by the sallow skin , the dark patches under his eyes , the shoulders hunched under the weight of the cloak . <p> " Negronis for the old and wicked , " he called , beckoning for the waiter . " And lemonade for the young and innocent . " <p> The children scrambled up first with cries of pleasure . Roger insisted they each shake his hand with due solemnity before receiving their refreshments . " And a small cake , too , " he added . " They 're excellent . " <p> " That 's a splendid outfit , Roger ! " Feletia exclaimed , kissing him on both cheeks . " You look like a Doge . " <p> " Thank you . I am a Doge . I wore it for the ceremony of your arrival . " He bowed to the children . <p> " How romantic ! " Feletia exclaimed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . The cloak is a Fortuny . We found his atelier in an old square . I intend to be buried in it . " Roger made the sign of the cross . " With full rites . " <p> " Roger loves to be theatrical , " Sally said quickly . <p> We introduced Gwendolyn , and Roger led us to a table on the terrace . With a sigh of relief , he removed the cape and folded it on a chair with the hat on top . " One can only suffer so much grandeur . " <p> " How has it been going ? " I asked my friend as we sat down . <p> " How do you feel ? " <p> " He 's not well at all , " Sally answered , wiping her forehead with a paper napkin . " The poor man was exhausted when we arrived . " <p> Roger rolled his eyes , as if he were accustomed to hearing his wife explain to others how he felt . " I 'm fine . I 'm really fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make , folks . Two full days in Venice . Where shall we start ? " <p> " I 'd love to see Peggy Guggenheim 's collection , " said Feletia . <p> " We 'll put it on the list , " Roger agreed . " And the Academy . That 's a must . Do you remember Giorgione 's La Tempesta , Harry ? We studied it at college . " <p> " I 'm afraid not , " I said . <p> " Of course you do . " Feletia prodded my arm . " We have it in a book . A man leans on a pole-or perhaps it 's a spear . On the far side a woman nurses a child . In the background a storm approaches . " <p> " Exactly right ! " Roger exclaimed . " They gaze over our heads , wrapped in their own thoughts . " He smiled . " What fun to be together again . And in Venice ! Where shall we have dinner ? " <p> " Roger should have supper in bed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " We 'll start with pasta . " Roger turned to the girls and , pursing his lips , made loud sucking noises . They squealed with pleasure . <p> " Why not dine at the hotel our first night ? " Feletia asked . " It might be easier for all of us . " <p> We agreed to meet back on the terrace in an hour . While Roger took a nap , Feletia and I would unpack and bathe . Gwendolyn could call room-service for the children 's dinner . As we left the terrace , an accordion player and a fiddler were tuning their instruments . <p> " I want to eat out here with you , " Penny announced . " It 's more fun . " <p> Feletia 's scented bath smelled heavenly , and after she was finished I jumped in , sinking into the soapy water . <p> " Harry , may I come in and do my face ? " As she opened the door , she glanced at my belly emerging like a whale from the water . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'm on a vacation , " I said moodily . " Or thought I was . " <p> " Roger has a lovely sense of the dramatic , has n't he ? " she exclaimed . <p> " That 's why he 's a good trial lawyer . " <p> " He looked so noble in his cloak waiting on the steps . " <p> " He is noble . Sally said the doctors have little hope . He wo n't give in . " <p> With a twinge of nostalgia , I thought of our days together , wondering for a moment if that earlier intimacy , undermined by the ties of marriage , could be resurrected a final time ? <p> " He played Antipholus of Ephesus in The Comedy of Errors , " I said , " and wore a toga . I was his wife , Adriana . " <p> " You played a woman , Harry ! But you 're so hairy . " <p> " I was n't then . One line of mine brought down the house : Come , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art an elm , my husband , I a vine . . . ' " <p> I lay the warm washcloth over my eyes . " Roger was a year older than I , of course . That makes a difference with boys . I looked up to him . " <p> Feletia and I decided to have a drink in the bar before our friends arrived . It was cool and pleasant , and in the corner a pianist played songs of the twenties . We had ordered belinis , when I was summoned to the phone . It was Penny . She said Gwendolyn had vomited and had a headache . Room service had n't arrived and they wanted to come down for dinner . I returned to the table to consult with Feletia . <p> " They must be starved , poor dears , " she said . " Ask them to put on their green frocks and join us . " <p> " But this is our first night with Roger , Feletia . I want it to be perfect . " <p> " The children will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When they arrived , the back of Penny 's dress was unbuttoned and Angela 's shoes were untied . <p> " Can we eat now ? " Penny asked . <p> " Not yet , " I said . " I 'll order you a cool drink . " <p> " I 'm hungry , Daddy . " <p> " So am I , " said a voice behind me . I turned to see Roger . He had changed into a blue linen coat and white ducks . Sally 's green and orange Pucci was already crumpled . <p> " I 'm sorry about the children , " I said . " Gwendolyn is ill . " <p> " I 'll have to give the girls dinner in the dining room , I 'm afraid , " said Feletia . " At a separate table , of course . " <p> " We have n't had anything since breakfast , " said Penny . <p> " Nonsense ! " Feletia exclaimed . " You had lunch on the train . " <p> " It was n't lunch . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , " Roger said , smiling . " I 'm hungry , too . " <p> " Roger , I have n't ordered my martini ! " Sally exclaimed . <p> " We 'll have one at the table , dear . " He took Angela 's hand in one of his , Penny 's in the other . " Youth must be served . " <p> I was upset at having to leave the cocktail lounge before our friends had ordered their drinks . Roger took it in good humor but Sally was upset . It was n't a good omen . <p> The maitre d ' insisted he could not seat the children separately . The other tables were reserved . <p> " We ca n't all sit together , " I protested . <p> " Of course we can . " Roger squeezed the children 's hands . " It will be a family party . " <p> The sun was setting and a coolness had settled on the steaming terrace . The captain sat Angela and Penny near the railing where they could watch the boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately disappeared . It was half an hour before a waiter arrived and took our order for drinks . <p> " Perhaps we should order dinner too , " Penelope said . <p> " I will bring the cocktails first , madame , " the waiter said and quickly left . <p> Angela turned to watch the sea-gulls and knocked over a glass . The ice water flowed over her dress and she began to cry . Two heavily made-up women at a near-by table stopped their conversation to stare . <p> " Shh , " I whispered . " You 'll have to be quiet . " <p> " She 's tired , " said Feletia , mopping Angela 's dress with a napkin , " and hungry . " <p> " I 'm not tired . " Angela stopped crying . " I 'm wet . " <p> I looked around for the captain . He was seating a large party on the other side of the room , bowing and smiling . I waved my napkin , but he failed to see it . <p> " If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was becoming flustered . " I 'm sorry about this . " <p> " Bread is plentiful in Italy , " Roger said . " Very good bread , too , " He rose and walking to another table , asked an attractive young woman in his broken Italian if she could spare a piece of pane for the children . She passed him the straw basket with a delicious smile and he brought it back to the table in triumph . <p> " You 're a hero , Roger ! " Feletia exclaimed . " I did n't know you spoke Italian . " <p> " Poco . " He passed the bread to the children . They each took a piece , but without enthusiasm . " I could n't remember the word for butter . " <p> " Say thank you , " I said to the children . <p> " Does cancer hurt , Mr. Train ? " Penny asked , digging a finger into the bread . " Does it hurt real bad ? " <p> Roger stared down at the little girl in surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes it does . " <p> " Penny , what did I tell you ? " I whispered . <p> " I forgot , " she said . <p> " It 's all right , Harry . Speaking of my illness is not taboo . It ca n't be . Even for children . " <p> " Roger would have been a marvelous father , " Sally said sadly . <p> I felt the evening was coming apart . Nothing was turning out as I had planned . " Where are our drinks ? " I demanded of a passing bus boy . He did n't speak English . " Cocktails . . . waiter , " I insisted . <p> Angela pulled off a piece of bread and threw it over the railing in the general direction of the sea-gulls . <p> " Please do n't do that ! " Feletia said . <p> Deliberately , Angela tore off another piece and tossed it after the other . <p> " Stop that , " I whispered fiercely , pinching her lightly on the arm . <p> " Ouch , Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What did you do that for , Harry ? " Feletia put her arm around Angela . <p> " I did n't hurt her , " but I felt myself blush as I said it . I was acting boorishly , I knew that . " Let me see where I hurt you , honey , " I said , taking her arm . <p> " No , do n't ! " she screamed , pulling it away . " It stings . " <p> " Harry , you must do something about getting the captain , " Feletia said . " It 's been half an hour . " <p> " Damn it , what do you expect me to do ? " Then , embarrassed to have said it , something snapped . Sweeping up Angela under one arm and clutching Penny 's small hand in mine , I excused myself and strode to the door . Angela arched her back and yelled as if she had been beaten , the cords in her neck vibrating . The hot little body squirmed to be loose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged her feet . <p> Without glancing to either side , I brushed passed the advancing maitre d ' . I knew he was displeased . " Signore. . . " he began . I did n't wait to hear . <p> Feletia caught up with me as I reached the lift . " You 're making a spectacle of yourself , Harry . Put Angela down . " " I 'll order sandwiches for them , " I said , pressing the elevator button with my shoulder . " You go back . " <p> " You ca n't leave Roger like this . He stayed over to see you . " <p> " What else can I do ? " I said , passing her the squirming child . <p> Roger and Sally came up . " I do n't suppose we can help , " he said . <p> Angela was inhaling sobs as if they were something to eat . Strands of wet hair fell across her eyes . <p> " I 'm sorry about this , " I said . " Please start dinner without us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our rooms , " Sally said . " Roger has a headache . " <p> " I am a bit tired . " My friend smiled wanly at the children . " Tomorrow I 'll be fine . Perhaps we 'll see a puppet show . Would you like that ? " <p> Both children , still sniffling , nodded . <p> " Take Angela 's hand , " I said to Feletia as the door opened . " I 'll hold Penny 's . " <p> As we edged to the back of the elevator , Roger turned to me . " Do you remember the day my mother brought me to your house for tea and you threw wet mud on my new linen suit ? You were seven then , I was eight . " He looked down at the girls from his great height and grinned . " When he was your age , your father had a fierce temper . " <p> Angela and Penny stared open-eyed at Roger , their whimpers subsiding . <p> " This is where we get off , " Sally said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Roger leaned down and kissed each of the children on their wet cheeks . " We 'll have fun , " he repeated . " I promise . " <p> As the elevator door began to close , my eyes met his . He smiled , teeth slightly askew , chin tilted . In spite of the fall of his shoulders , I saw a flicker of something : understanding , perhapseven love . <p> " What a bloody shame it turned out like that , " I said to Feletia as we sat alone at our table , the children fed and asleep upstairs . " You made an ass of yourself , Harry , " she said quietly . " You should have relaxed . Roger did n't mind . " <p> She was right , of course . He did n't . It was me . I wanted the perfect evening , perfect children , perfect me . <p> I spent a restless night , filled with snatches of confused dreams . In one , I was rushing for luncheon at a large hotel when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Roger 's birthday and I had been chosen by friends to be the main speaker . I was supposed to be funny and loving . The clock outside a jewelry store indicated I was half an hour late . The hotel was n't where I thought it should be . I 'd forgotten the address . No one seemed to know where the hotel was-or if it existed . Desperately , I began to run along the hot pavement , sweat pouring down my face and inside my shirt . <p> The early morning rain had stopped as I emerged from the hotel . A respite of sun renewed the vivid colors and gilt of Venice : bridges , houses , domes were reflected in its waterways . Roger had n't slept well the night before and was resting in bed . The hotel doctor was on his way . Feletia had sent me off to scout the city while she took the children to the Lido , leaving Gwendolyn disconsolate in bed . <p> After crossing the Piazza San Marco , I turned up a side street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Around a corner , I came across a small church , its surfaces damp and mottled with age . A woman in black and two small children were climbing the worn steps . All three crossed themselves as they passed through the wooden doors . On an impulse , I followed . Inside it was cold , musty , crepuscular . I found a reference in my guidebook to an altarpiece in a side chapel , artist unknown . <p> It was a painting of the crucifixion , faded and smokeencrusted . As my eyes became accustomed to the half-light , its beauty became apparent . The cross lay flat on the stones of a courtyard , two rough carpenters drove nails into the condemned man 's hands and feet . The twisted body of Christ appeared strangely relaxed , the eyes closed , the face serene . <p> Perhaps it was because Roger was so much on my mind , that something in the figure 's position reminded me of a day at boarding school many years before . A few classmates were sunning on the grass after classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half-asleep . <p> I had been in the art studio and , on an impulse , took a charcoal pencil out of my pocket . " I 'll draw a woman on your front , Roger . A tattoo of a naked lady . " <p> " Be my guest , " he said , without opening his eyes . <p> As the others crowded around , I traced the outline of a voluptuous woman . Her head , with its staring eyes and thick grinning lips , began under Roger 's chin , long black hair spreading out over his arms . The breasts were his nipples which I encircled and enlarged . To the urging of my audience , I continued the torso down his chest . <p> " Am I hurting ? " I asked . <p> " No . " Roger raised his head and looked . " Will it wash off ? " <p> " Easily , " I said , rubbing my thumb on a streak of charcoal and showing it to him . " Your belly-button will be her cunt , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lint , I traced muscular thighs surrounding my friend 's belly . Then , hearing a snicker behind me , I paused . Where the shins had to go was the beginning of Roger 's pubic hair , the ankles and feet would be entangled in his genitals . Embarrassed , I fastened the top button of his shorts . Roger did n't stir , his eyes remained closed , his mouth curved in a sardonic grin . I completed the woman 's knees and stopped there . Now , twenty years later , sitting in the darkness of a Venetian chapel , I imagined another scenario . What if Roger and I had been alone ? He almost naked , I clothed , tracing the outlines of a woman on his chest . Would I have buttoned his shorts so prissily , truncating the figure or , to complete the picture , might I have plunged into the crinkly forest of his hair ? <p> Feletia met me at the door of our room in tears . The doctor had advised Roger to leave for home at once . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sally answered my knock . " Do n't stay long , " she warned . The shades were half-drawn , a ripple of water was reflected on the wall . My friend was lying quietly under a single sheet , one arm across his chest . He smiled when he saw me and slightly turned his head . " Did you see La Tempesta in the Academy ? " he asked . <p> " No , I thought I 'd wait for you . " <p> " Do n't wait , " he said . " Feletia and you must see it . I insist you go now . Take Sally . " Roger closed his eyes . " The painting is beautiful , gentle . The man and woman are separated , as if afraid of a greater intimacy . " He smiled . " A parable of the human condition . " <p> I wondered if I should tell him about the crucifixion , but was unable to . Later I wished I had . " I will go to the Academy tomorrow , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could feel the brittle bones beneath the skin . The slow pulsation of his blood . " We have known each other a long , long time , have n't we ? " He paused . " Do n't worry about last night , old friend ... It had its own magic-life at its tumultuous beginning . " <p> A few minutes later I left . <p> Many years later I saw in an exhibition a pen and ink drawing by Francesco Guardi . Heightened by black chalk and a brown wash , the drawing recorded one of the most spectacular festivals of eighteenth-century Venice . " The Festa della Sensa , " the catalogue said , " celebrated annually the marriage of the City of Venice and the Adriatic in commemoration of the conquest of Dalmatia by Doge Pietro Oresolo . " Off S. Nico di Lido , a procession of gondolas escorted the state barge back to the city . Pennants flew from the masthead . <p> The drawing brought to mind our arrival in Venice by gondola that long ago afternoon . Roger on the stone pier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A genial condottiere ! I imagined then , as if in a dream , a different funeral than the simple one he was given several months after his return . <p> . . . It is nighttime and my friend rides in state in a fabulous gondola designed by Giovanni Battista Piranesi . Within an open ebony coffin , with handles of gold , Roger lies covered with a black cloak , its embossed collar closed against the Adriatic breeze . Angela and Penny sit by his side , charming in blue dresses and wide-brimmed hats . I stand with Sally and Feletia . We hold burning tapers . Smaller gondolas , carrying boon companions , follow silently behind . Each of us-caught by the painter 's brush-appears distant from the others , wrapped in our private thoughts . The scene is placid , poetic , contemplative . In the distance , a storm approaches . . <p>
