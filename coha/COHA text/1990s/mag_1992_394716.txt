A lightweight , all-purpose tripod solved my observing problems . I can use my 8-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain on its wedge for solar viewing during the day and switch to my 6-inch f/5 Dobsonian for nighttime observing using the same sturdy tripod . Another simple switch and I 'm using binoculars or a 6-inch Newtonian reflector . The tripod can support Dobsonian , cantilevered Dobsonian , German equatorial , and Schmidt-Cassegrain wedge mountings . It also doubles as an observing stool . ( Ouch ! Remove the Teflon pads and central bolts first . ) All of this strength and capability can be yours for about $40 . The secret of this tripod 's success is simple . The legs have triangular cross-sections , giving them incredible lateral stability . The wooden components dampen out vibrations caused by moving the scope or bumping into the mount . The tripod folds for storage and easy transport . Large bolts at the moving joints allow tightening for future wear and provide the friction for rock-solid structural support . The tripod contains three basic assemblies : the tripod head , the legs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount and secures the tops of the tripod legs . The spreaders prevent the legs from extending too far and also tie the legs together for rigidity . THE TRIPOD HEAD Building the tripod takes a weekend or two . Let 's start with the tripod head . I built my head assembly from 3/4 " exterior grade ( A-C ) plywood . ( Depending on the finish you want to apply to the tripod , you may wish to use a more expensive cabinet-grade plywood . You could also use hardwoods for the tripod head . ) A quarter panel ( 2 ' by 4 ' ' ) is more than sufficient for all of the tripod parts . The tripod head contains four pieces of wood : two 10 " - diameter disks and two hubs . ( You may wish to make the disks larger for big scopes . ) Cut a 3-1/2 " circle ( or a little wider than the 3/4 " pipe flange ) in the center of one of the disks . This becomes the bottom disk . The hubs have a triangular shape ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . ( Photos omitted ) A template makes transferring the hub design to the plywood sheet easier . The arms of the hub are 2 " wide and the inner circular section of the hub has a diameter of 7 " . Mark the center of the hubs for a hole to be drilled later . Cut the disks and hubs from the sheet of plywood with a power scroll saw . Consider buying a " laminate " blade that cuts on the down stroke of the saw to make smooth , curved cuts . On the top disk , lay out the positions for the mounting holes required for your telescope mounts . T-nuts fit into these holes to secure the mounts . My tripod has T-nuts for an 8 " Schmidt-Cassegrain wedge , two Dobsonian rocker-box mounts , my mirror-plus-binocular observing system , and a flange that holds a German equatorial mount . The T-nut holes used for my wedge double as the holes for the Dobsonian Teflon bearings . I simply screw 1/4-20 bolts through three countersunk Teflon pads . A center T-nut and bolt hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes through the disk at the mounting hole positions and install 1/4-20 T-nuts in the holes . ( My T-nuts required 5/16 " holes . ) Make sure the bottoms of the T-nuts are flush with the surface of the wood . The T-nuts will actually be sandwiched between the plywood disks and provide strong mounting points . On the bottom side of the disk , center the pipe flange and fasten it with l/2 " screws . Fasten the two disks together with carpenter 's glue and 1-1/4 " screws . Likewise , join the two hub pieces together . Once the glue is dry , drill a 1-1/4 " hole in the center of the hub . Drill the hole halfway from each side for a truer hole and to avoid splintering the wood at the surface . Shape the hubs  --  except for the outer edge ( 10 " diameter )  --  with a rasp and then sand them . Also sand the bottom portion of the joined disks . The bolts for leg attachment require holes in each arm of the hub . Drill the hole about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gluing face . As with the central hole , drill halfway from each side for a truer hole . Align the central hole in the hub with the pipe flange in the disks . Glue and fasten the hubs to the disks with 2-1/2 " screws . The finished tripod head consists of four layers of plywood . When the glue has dried , shape the outer edges of the disks and hubs with a rasp . LEGS AND SUPPORTS Two pieces make up each leg . Their length depends upon your scope ( or scopes ) , the type of mount , and your height . A refractor might need legs as long as 60 " to permit easy viewing near the horizon , while a reflector might require 30 " to 36 " legs to permit comfortable viewing near the zenith . Make the legs a little longer than you estimate you 'll need because you can cut them shorter but not easily make them longer . Round the ends of the legs to prevent chipping and splintering of the wood . A bolt through a hole about 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second hole about 11 " from the top ( 16-1/2 " for long legs ) will hold the spreader bolt . This hole should position the spreader at the bottom of the pipe . A hole about 5/8 " from the top will pass the bolt connecting the legs to the tripod head . The pipe mounted to the tripod head forms the central support for the legs ( see photo above ) . A 7 " plywood hub moves up and down the pipe . Spreaders connect the sliding hub to the legs , thus locking the legs into a triangular section . The sliding hub has a similar shape to the hub in the tripod head assembly . The major difference is that the sliding hub has a 3/4 " slot cut in each arm to hold a spreader . To prevent the wood from splitting , the total width of each arm should be at least 2-1/2 " . Cut the two pieces of the hub from 3/4 " plywood . A template facilitates laying out the design on the plywood . If you use A-C plywood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the template over to lay out the second hub piece to reduce any chance of error when joining the two pieces . Glue and screw the pieces together with two 1-1/4 " screws in the central portion of the hub . Once the glue has dried , shape the pieces with a rasp . Be sure that the spreaders will fit in the slots . Drill a 1-1/8 " hole in the center of the sliding hub , again drilling halfway from each side . The pipe should slide freely through this hole but not wobble in the hole . Drill holes for 1/4 " bolts in the arms of the sliding hub about 1 " from the end and along the central glue joint . Place a scrap block of wood in the slot to prevent the drill from splintering the wood of the arm . A separate block locks the sliding hub in place ( see photo opposite ) . ( Photos omitted ) It consists of two 3/4 " plywood pieces glued and screwed together . The block is a 3-1/2 " circle with an arm that extends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central hole and a l/8 " - wide slot cut through the arm to the central hole . Drill a hole 1 " from the end of the arm along the glue seam . A 1/4 " bolt and a T-handle clamp the block in place on the pipe when the tripod is set up . You may wish to screw the clamping block to the sliding hub after you test fit them on the pipe . The spreaders fit between the sliding hub and the legs . The exact length depends on your tripod height . The bottoms of the legs should extend beyond the head of the tripod 1 " for every 5 " to 7 " of tripod height . Spreaders will thus be about 5 " to 6-1/2 " long . Place the bolt holes in the spreaders 3/4 " from the end to prevent splitting . Round the ends of the spreaders so they will pivot in the hub and legs more easily . FINISH AND ASSEMBLY Sand all the pieces to remove splinters . You may wish to sand further to provide a smoother finish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so stain and varnish or paint it according to your taste . If you are painting the tripod with an enamel or other finish that bonds to itself upon contact , you may not want to paint the portions of the tripod head , sliding hubs , and legs where they meet . After the finish is dry , the pipe may be screwed into the flange in the tripod head . Insert but do not tighten 2 " bolts in the bottoms of the legs . With the tripod head on the ground , attach the legs to the tripod head with 4 " bolts . Slide the locking block and then the sliding hub over the pipe and screw on the pipe cap . Attach the spreaders to each leg and the sliding block with 3 " bolts . Now tighten the bolts on the bottoms of the legs . Invert the tripod so it is sanding . Tighten the leg bolts just enough to provide a strong friction fit  --  too tight and the tripod will not fold , too loose and the legs will allow too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the proper bolt tension . Folding and unfolding the tripod is a matter of simply unlocking and locking the block and moving the sliding hub up and down the pipe . The universal tripod is portable yet sturdy . Replacing the tripod 's short legs with longer legs will transform the tripod from a reflector mount to one for refractors . This tripod could be your solution for that unmounted scope in the garage or for those observing sessions in the country when you want a lightweight tripod . Its uses will stretch as far as your imagination . M. Leon Knott has built telescopes for 15 years and operates StarStorm , a telescope-making company in Flagstaff , Arizona . <p>
