Henry Chauncey 's Idea // It is February 4 , 1945 . A man named Henry Chauncey is sitting in an Episcopal church in Cambridge , Massachusetts  --  an old , gray , simple , graceful building on the Cambridge Common , where George Washington first took command of troops in the American Revolution . It 's the Sunday morning before his fortieth birthday . He is perfectly at home here . Descendant of Puritan clerics , son of an Episcopal minister , graduate of the country 's leading Episcopal boarding school , Chauncey , in his tweeds and flannels , wearing his gray hair neatly plastered across his forehead , is a full-fledged , born-in member of a distinct American subculture . In the seventeenth-century graveyard next to the church lie his forefathers . // One of the central tenets of this particular subculture is that you do n't put on airs . You imagine a kind of ordinary decency to be your chief quality . Chauncey 's life , like the life of everyone else who is in the church this morning , has its good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete success to switch from cigarettes to a pipe . Money is a bit of a problem , and so , in all honesty , is his marriage . On the other hand , he is optimistic and he believes in things , which is a great temperamental blessing . He never complains ; one does n't . He is a respectable man trying to do his best . // Bursting through the tight seams , though , is something grander and more ambitious in Chauncey . First of all , he looks like more than what he is , which is merely an ill-paid assistant dean at Harvard College . He 's tall , barrel-chested , big-jawed , and moon-faced , almost simian , with bushy black eyebrows and a commandingly vigorous physical presence  --  the kind of person who ought to be put in charge of something . Notwithstanding the appealing modesty , his group , as every one of its members knows very well , occupies a highly favored  --  from today 's point of view , almost unimaginably favored  --  position in American society . High-Protestant men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great university presidencies , the captaincies of finance and the professions , and many other leading positions , and each has rough access to the others . What any member of the group , including even Henry Chauncey , thinks and wants matters a great deal more than what members of other groups think and want . // The Second World War is now drawing to its conclusion , which , it is clear at last , will be a total victory by the Allies . The war has made the United States into the greatest power in the world , the central and essential civilization that , Americans hope , will serve as a model of how to organize a society properly . The United States is not only unusually influential at this moment but also unusually malleable . The war has put the country into flux , and basic arrangements can be altered now in a way that would be impossible in normal times . For a man of Henry Chauncey 's social class , entering the prime of life , with direct experience of the drama and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utopian dreams about the shape of the postwar world and the part one might take in realizing them . Chauncey knows that big changes in American society are coming , and that they are going to be made swiftly , out of public view , by a tight group of men quite a number of whom he knows personally . The imminent prospect of joining in this is exhilarating . So , as he prays and listens and sings through the comfortable and familiar service , Henry Chauncey is thinking expansively about his future and the country's. // After the service he goes home , takes out a diary he has recently begun keeping ( and filling with portentous , idealistic musings about the new age that is dawning ) , and writes : // Finally , I decided to take the plunge . From a safe and respected job I am embarking on an opportunity whose development depends very much on what I do . // During Church this morning a thought occurred to me which though not new was amplified in its implications . There will undoubtedly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our human resources in terms of capacities for different kinds of employment .... This project requires consideration from a lot of angles but men of vision in the field of testing , vocational guidance , government , economics , education could be consulted individually and eventually in groups and a program eventually developed . Men with whom this might be discussed might even be so high in authority as ... President Roosevelt himself . // This is what Henry Chauncey wants to do in ( for , really ! ) postwar America : he wants to mount a vast scientific project that will categorize , sort , and route the entire population . It will be accomplished by administering a series of multiple-choice mental tests to everyone , and then by suggesting , on the basis of the scores , what each person 's role in society should be  --  suggestions everyone will surely accept gratefully . The project will be called the Census of Abilities . It will accomplish something not very different from what Chauncey 's Puritan ancestors came to the New World wanting to do  --  engender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but via twentieth-century technical means . The vehicle through which he hopes to achieve all this is an aborning organization called the Educational Testing Service , purveyor of a test called the SAT . You 've heard of it ? The residue of the Census of Abilities is the standardized tests that you took in high school and college , that you probably prepared for and sweated over because it seemed they would determine your fate in life . Right now , Chauncey is about to become the first president of the Educational Testing Service . That 's the plunge he 's taking . // The way that Henry Chauncey 's thoughts were running near the end of the Second World War is pertinent not just as an example of the tenor of that moment , and not just because Chauncey was on the point of founding an important American institution . American society was , in fact , at a crossroads  --  Chauncey may have been dreaming , but he was n't fantasizing . A quiet but intense competition was taking place over the future structure of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he belonged to the group that decided things back then , and particularly because he was connected to a powerful patron , James Bryant Conant , the president of Harvard University . // Chauncey believed in progress and wanted to be part of it . He was sure that an expansion of mental testing , which seemed to him to be a science with limitless possibilities , was the proper avenue . But he was an agnostic on the question of what form , exactly , the progress should take . Conant was not . He had a plan fully worked out , which he had recently proposed in a series of righteous , almost inflammatory magazine articles : to depose the existing , undemocratic American elite and replace it with a new one made up of brainy , elaborately trained , public-spirited people drawn from every section and every background . These people ( men , actually ) would lead the country . They would manage the large technical organizations that would be the backbone of the late-twentieth-century United States and create , for the first time ever , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conant assumed , in fact , that picking a new elite in just the right way would enhance democracy and justice almost automatically . It was an audacious plan for engineering a change in the leadership group and social structure of the country  --  a kind of quiet , planned coup d ' ? tat . // Chauncey 's wishes and Conant 's both came true : the United States did embark on the world 's largest-scale program of mental testing , and one consequence of this ( though not the only one ) was the establishment of a new national elite . The machinery that Conant and Chauncey and their allies created is today so familiar and all-encompassing that it seems almost like a natural phenomenon , or at least an organism that evolved spontaneously in response to conditions . It 's not . It 's man-made . The organized way we have of deciding who winds up where in American society exists because , in the intense maneuvering of the period before , during , and just after the war , one particular system triumphed over other , alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . A thick line runs through the country , with people who have been to college on one side of it and people who have n't on the other . This line gets brighter all the time . Whether a person is on one side of the line or the other is now more indicative of income , of attitudes , and of political behavior than any other line one might draw : region , race , age , religion , sex , class . As people plan their lives and their children 's lives , higher education is the main focus of their aspirations ( and the possibility of getting into the elite end of higher education is the focus of their very dearest aspirations ) . A test of one narrow quality , the ability to perform well in school , stands firmly athwart the path to success . Those who do n't have that ability will have much less chance than those who do to display their other talents later . // The placing of such a heavy load on higher education has had many other effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into college and graduate school . Educational opportunity has become a national obsession . There is a politics of it , a jurisprudence of it , and a philosophy of it  --  none of which was the case fifty years ago . To improve it is the fundamental promise made by most candidates for public office . It is the fundamental good that parents try to get for their children . Preoccupation with it is the chief theme of the first quarter of Americans ' lives . It is the object of elaborate work , hope , scheming , manipulation , and competition . // Those who do best under this system make up a distinct class , with its own mores and beliefs and tastes and folkways . They do n't serve as the unquestioned leadership of the United States , as Conant and Chauncey would have expected ; they 're at least as much resented as admired . They are n't perceived by others as people who have earned their position in completely open and fair competition ( though that 's the way they perceive themselves ) or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , they are Conant 's and Chauncey 's children , precisely the products of the ideas they had and the moves they made after the end of the Second World War . // One way to understand the current shape of American society is as its being the result of Conant 's , Chauncey 's , and their allies ' concerted attack on a specific problem , which was so successful that the problem no longer exists . So much force was marshaled against that one problem , though , that in addition to its being solved , practically everything else was changed , too  --  which created new problems . The story of what happened has to begin with the original problem , or else it does n't make sense . // Here is what American society looked like , from the point of view of Conant and Chauncey , at the close of the Second World War . // They took it as a given that the essence of American greatness was a quality that Alexis de Tocqueville had remarked upon early in the nineteenth century : social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other country . Because the United States did n't have a rigid class system , it could take full advantage of its people 's talents and at the same time generate intense social cohesion across a range of physical space and a variety of ethnic origin that elsewhere would have been considered insuperable . // But during the early twentieth century American society had taken an ominous turn . Conant and Chauncey accepted without question the view of Frederick Jackson Turner , the historian of the American West who was a Harvard professor in their younger days , that what had made the United States democratic and classless was the availability of open land on the Western frontier . Now the frontier was closed , the country had become industrial , and the cities were crowded with immigrant workers , many of whom were socialists  --  or who , at the very least , believed that group unity , rather than individual opportunity , was the highest good . // Even worse , a distinct American upper class had emerged . It was very much on display at Harvard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Second World War , rich heedless young men with servants , whose lives revolved around parties and sports , not studying , set the tone of college life . The plurality of Harvard students had come from boys ' boarding schools in New England , the kind where parents could register their sons at birth ; pretty much anybody who went to one of these schools , and was not " a little slow , " and could pay the tuition , could go to Harvard , or to Princeton , or to Yale . Even the faculty was disproportionately made up of proper Bostonians , rather than modern academics . // Harvard and institutions like it fed into another series of institutions : law firms , Wall Street financial houses , the Foreign Service , research hospitals , and university faculties . These , too , had begun to look like the province of a hereditary upper class . All the good places were reserved for members of a certain group  --  the all-male , Eastern , high-Protestant , privately educated group to which Henry Chauncey belonged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases that required of them a careful extirpation of any accent or other noticeable expression of their alien culture . Nonwhites were n't in close enough range of membership in the elite to be excluded . And even the fieriest social reformers of the day did n't think to suggest that women ought routinely to participate in running the country . Snobbishness , small-mindedness , and prejudice were the worst aspects of the elite institutions , but even at their best they were preoccupied with a vaguely defined personal quality called " character , " and tended to ignore intelligence and scientific expertise . But these , precisely , were the traits Conant thought most vitally necessary in postwar America . // What could you do to dethrone this upper class and restore the United States to its true democratic nature ? It was a question without an obvious answer . Using the educational system to create a fair society , which seems today like the way to do the job , looked then like a distant , unrealized , possibly unrealizable dream . // At the close of the Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leader in trying to educate a large part of the citizenry for more than a hundred years . During the nineteenth century Americans created , not without a struggle , the free public elementary school as a basic social institution and , during the first half of the twentieth century , the high school . These institutions were n't well enough established to be taken for granted as they are now . In 1940 the country still had n't passed the milestone of graduating more than half its teenagers from high school . The idea that there might be a way of evaluating all American high-school students on a single national standard and then making sure that they went on to colleges suited to their abilities and ambitions  --  most people would have regarded that as a wild , futuristic fantasy , although Chauncey and Conant were among a handful of people who knew that , technically , it could be done . // Colleges were the same story as public schools . The United States provided far more people with higher education than any country ever had  --  about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty stayed long enough to get a degree . But these students were the ones whose parents had enough money to send them to college ; American higher education 's size did n't mean that it was open to everyone . Neither was it established that professors should be respected , well-compensated , formally trained experts dedicated to advancing the frontiers of knowledge by conducting rigorous , objective research . During the late nineteenth century , hundreds of American scholars had gone to Germany to receive strict academic training ( because that was the only country where it was available ) and came back imbued with the goal of setting up German-style research universities here . It was an appealing picture , Herr Doktor Professor as scientific figure sitting atop a formal university hierarchy and consulted by government and industry , but by the Second World War it had scarcely been achieved . // Most leading private universities , like Harvard , drew their students and faculty from a local or regional pool and had a genteel , belletristic quality . In most cases their students were male . In private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose announced purpose was to prepare them for supporting roles in life . Most African-Americans who went to college went to black colleges , which were also segregated by sex . State public universities were , in contrast , open to just about anyone ( except those in the South ) , but most were expected by their state legislatures to impart the educational basics to all comers first , and conduct advanced research second . // Within the inner and higher chambers of American society a struggle was under way to reform  --  literally re-form  --  schooling at all levels . It had been going on all through the Depression and war years , spiritedly , sometimes bitterly , without attracting public notice . All the participants shared Chauncey 's and Conant 's assumption that education was going to change dramatically and was going to turn into the mainspring of American society , the repository of the country 's distinctive greatness . // This book tells , for the first time , the story of the new system that emerged after the Second World War : where the ideas animating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what other choices were rejected , what compromises were made along the way , and how the new leaders ' lives and their roles in the country 's drama turned out . // Whatever Tocqueville thought , the United States has always been a country with an elite , or a series of elites , overlapping , competing , and succeeding one another . Henry Chauncey did not share Conant 's animus against the American elite of the mid-twentieth century . That was because he was a member of it . Indeed , the story of the Chauncey family makes a good capsule history of the progression of elites in America . // The Chauncys ( as the name was originally spelled ) were never just ordinary folks , and they were never holders of a simple unprepossessing idea of the world . Originally they were Norman noblemen who came to England in the conquest of 1066 and wound up as barons in Yorkshire . In the 1400s they were dispossessed and moved down a notch , into the ministerial class . The Chauncy who moved to America , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and became a professor of Greek there , but he was mainly a devout and opinionated Puritan minister who spent his life getting into disputes with church authorities . In 1629 he was hauled before the high commission court for publicly criticizing the Church of England 's policy of allowing sports , games , and recreation on Sundays . In 1635 he was thrown into prison for publishing a lengthy treatise protesting the placing of a railing around the communion table . He won his release by writing a weak recantation  --  though according to a family history written by one of his descendants , he " deeply bewailed his sinful compliance " until his dying day . // In 1637 Chauncy left England for the Massachusetts Bay Colony , where , even in a community of fellow Puritans , he stood out as a vehement critic of what he regarded as excessive religious laxness . He created " much trouble , " in the words of Governor John Winthrop , by expressing the view that " the children ought to be dipt and not sprinkled " at their baptism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribulations of American life , Chauncy resolved to return to England , where the Puritans had taken power and the bishop who had tormented him " had given his head to the block . " He changed his mind , however , when he was made president of Harvard College , on condition " that he forbear to disseminate or publish any tenets concerning immersion baptism . " // Everybody thinks of America as a country where people came to escape formal social structures  --  a place with a genius for disorganization . Charles Chauncy represents another strain that has been present in American society all along . No amount of anachronistic pretzel-twisting can make him into a populist or a democrat . He was self-consciously a figure at the top of society . He did come here to escape an order that he found oppressive  --  but only because he hoped to help create a new order that would be stricter and therefore more virtuous than the old one . // But where Puritans like Chauncy do connect to the modern American creed is in their idea that the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was a radical notion , and it led in the direction of a society run by people who had earned their places by good works , rather than by an upper class selected by birth . The last controversy of Charles Chauncy 's theologically combative life was over the Halfway Covenant , a Puritan doctrine that granted the privilege of automatic baptism to the grandchildren of members of the elect . Chauncy was dead set against it . Initiation into the state of grace , he felt , ought not be conferred by inheritance . // Charles Chauncy died in 1671 , having well established his family in New England . The best-known Chauncy of the 1700s was one of his great-grandsons , also named Charles Chauncy , who for decades was minister of the Presbyterian First Church of Boston . This Charles Chauncy was the leading opponent of the Great Awakening , the ecstatic revival movement that was led by the young , charismatic , showy Congregational minister Jonathan Edwards out on the wild frontier surrounding Northampton , Massachusetts . In 1742 Edwards published his credo , Some Thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next year Chauncy published a censorious rebuttal , Seasonable Thoughts on the State of Religion in New England , which lengthily disapproved of preachers like Edwards who , in dealing with their flock , " aimed at putting their Passions into a Ferment . " // The Chauncy sternness is unmistakable . The family remained in its traditional position of being as ambitiously idealistic as anybody about the national enterprise , about the quest for the good , but in believing that there had to be a disciplined , orderly , restrained means to that end . Jonathan Edwards represented a trust in the good instincts of all people , however unruly that mass might be ; Charles Chauncy , belief in a trained , systematic elite . By this time , though , most of the descendants of the original Puritans , including Chauncy , were bound up in the prosperous commercial culture of New England 's cities and towns . They were migrating from their original Congregationalism into more conventional Protestant denominations , and from the ministry into trade . // In the nineteenth century the Chaunceys ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moralism , became rich . They were early exemplars of what one of their twentieth-century relatives , Joseph Alsop , the Washington columnist , called " the WASP ascendancy . " The first family member named Henry Chauncey , who was born in 1795 , went into foreign trade . During the 1830s he moved to Chile . As if to provide evidence for Max Weber 's future theories about the connection between Puritanism and capitalism , he took pains to persuade his family back home that his main concern in business was with virtue , not money . He wrote his father-in-law in 1835 : " Be assured that I have not been influenced by a desire of great wealth , no part of my ambition is to be thought rich , if I have enough to give my children a good education , to carry us through and a few dollars to help those that are in need is all I require . " Nonetheless , Chauncey returned to America with a substantial fortune . He lived in a mansion on Washington Square in New York City . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined them . They lived splendidly in New York , whiled away days at their clubs , and pursued expensive hobbies . His son Frederick , the grandfather of our Henry Chauncey , created a series of beautifully illustrated little notebooks about his recreations  --  Birds Shot , Fish Caught  --  and worked as a merchant . In 1884 his business failed because Frederick 's partner had secretly and disastrously speculated with its funds . Frederick soon caught pneumonia following a game of racquets and died at the age of forty-seven . His wife and four children fell into a pathetic existence that sounds like the subplot of an Edith Wharton novel . Socially impeccable but broke , they lived in a modest apartment on the Upper East Side , supported by subventions from relatives . Mrs. Chauncey took the position that because of their misfortunes , none of the children should ever marry or leave home . // The only one who disobeyed her was Henry 's father , Egisto Fabbri Chauncey ( named , before the terrible truth came out , after Frederick Chauncey 's dishonest partner ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although as an Episcopalian he was affiliated with the American branch of the Church of England , the very institution the Puritans had come here to escape . His son Henry Chauncey was born in 1905 . In his baby book , carefully preserved , there was a place to write down what " people are reading " ; Mrs. Chauncey listed Thomas Dixon 's The Clansman ( one of the books on which the movie Birth of a Nation was based ) , Edith Wharton 's The House of Mirth , and Jack London 's War of the Classes , indicating a country that was still , despite the best improving efforts of two and a half centuries of Chaunceys , in a state of upheaval over matters of race , class , and social exclusion . // The Chaunceys , however , were not in the slightest daunted in their quest for a perfected , orderly America .

Over one of the doorways he had painted a motto , taken from the Book of Proverbs : " Where there is no vision the people perish . " // ( Continues ... )
