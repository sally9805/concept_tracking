Many years ago , I spent several weeks at the Negev Institute for Desert Research studying the effects of water deprivation on the kidney function of camels . The camels had gone without water for fourteen days . While I had plenty of water to drink , I was suffering from the heat and sweating profusely . Even though the camels had lost fifty gallons of body water each , they gazed into the distance , serenely chewing their cuds with what I imagined were contemptuous smiles at my discomfort . Only after I 'd made shade for myself by stretching a sheet between four poles , was I able to finish my experiments . The camels appeared to be unaffected by the heat , but it has taken me years of research to find out why . The ancestors of camels originated in North America 40 to 50 million years ago , but not until land bridges were formed , about 3 million years ago , did they migrate to other parts of the world . Other cameloid species have adapted to harsh environments  --  the llama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cold , dry air of the Andes and the two-humped bactrian to the arid cold of the Gobi Desert . But the one-humped dromedary of the Arabian and African deserts thrives in some of the hottest and driest climates on earth . What particularly distinguishes the desert camel is its ability to relinquish strict homoiothermy and allow its body temperature to fluctuate according to the rise and fall of the environmental temperature . In the cool of the night and early morning , a camel 's core temperature can drop to about 93deg F , rising with air temperatures during the day to 106deg F. As a result , the difference between a camel 's body temperature and that of its environment is never as large as it is for other mammals , and so the flow of heat from the air to its body is reduced . Another of the camel 's physiological adaptations to heat is its " adjustable " metabolic rate . Since , in all living things , up to 80 percent of the energy produced by the metabolism of food is released as heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangered by a speedup in internal heat production . The camel 's response is to have a slower metabolic rate in summer than in winter  --  the reverse of most mammals . In addition , dehydration slows a camel 's metabolism by triggering a drop in thyroid function . With less thyroxine in its system , the camel 's respiratory rate also slows , thereby reducing water loss through the respiratory tract . When I touched the camel 's nasal mucosa , I discovered that it actually felt cool . Every breath , therefore , cools the blood flowing from the nose to the body . This has particular significance for the brain because , in addition to a lowered respiratory rate , the camel , like dik-diks , oryx , gazelles , and other long-nosed animals , as well as a number of carnivores , has a network of blood vessels , called the carotid rete , just below the brain ( see " A Wonderful Safety Net for Mammals , " page 63 ) . ( Page omitted ) The rete insures that when core body temperature is high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destined for the brain . Camel blood is unusual in two ways : it contains more water than that of other mammals , and its unique , oval-shaped red blood cells stay intact even when the serum , or liquid component surrounding the cells , is reduced and highly concentrated . Under similar conditions , the red cells of other mammals would shrivel and the blood would cease flowing and transporting body heat outward to the skin , rapidly leading to a lethal heatstroke . But even after a camel has lost more than a third of its body water , its blood continues to circulate and dissipate heat . Such large losses of body water are slow , however , taking place over weeks . The camel conserves fluids by excreting extremely dry feces and recycling water from the kidneys to the first of four stomachs and then back to the blood . By contrast , ruminants such as cows and goats can not recycle water and lose so much fluid when heat stressed that the alimentary tract and kidneys cease functioning entirely . A camel , after recycling its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and rehydrate its blood and kidneys in less than an hour . To counteract heat and dehydration , the camel also modifies its behavior . If possible , it remains in a recumbent position for long periods during the day , thus reducing the heat energy produced by muscle activity and food metabolism . It urinates on its long legs , and as the urine evaporates , the blood vessels on the legs are cooled . Other coolants  --  albeit in small amounts  --  are nasal secretions that the camel " collects " in a duct between the nose and the mouth . A camel may be seven feet tall at the hump and weigh more than a thousand pounds , so it can not avoid searing solar radiation in its shelterless , exposed desert habitat . Under such circumstances , however , size is an advantage , since a large object heats up much more slowly than a small one . No matter what the angle of the rays , a camel casts a wide shadow on the ground around its body ; this shade creates a cooler area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also take advantage of the shade cast by others and squat close to one another , creating an even larger cooled area . At the same time , each camel faces the sun so that the hump absorbs the most direct sunlight and the smallest possible body area is exposed . It will continue to orient itself in this position as the sun moves across the sky . The hump is a concentration of body fat that acts as a kind of protective cover , shielding the animal 's vital organs in the deeper layers of the body because it slows the conduction of heat . I have noticed that as the mass of fat heats up , the hump actually feels hot to the touch . The rest of the camel 's body has very little insulating fat , and therefore extra body heat can be transferred more quickly to the environment , particularly through the camel 's extremely thin legs . This is similar to the way in which a jack rabbit loses heat through its ears or a cow through its dewlaps . Thus the camel , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its need for water-dependent cooling mechanisms , while I , the scientist , in order to study the animal , require shelter and abundant drinking water . <p>
