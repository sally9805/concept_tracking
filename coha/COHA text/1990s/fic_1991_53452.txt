THE GERMAN SHEPHERD has yellow , triangular-shaped eyes which Larry Oronzio , the plumber , finds very hostile . She lies in the kitchen doorway , one paw crossed over the other . Larry has come to install the plumbing in the bathroom his client is having remodeled . His client 's name is Tracy Morrell . " Hello , I 'm Tracy , " she said when he came to give the estimate . Larry is not accustomed to calling clients by their first names . He would prefer to call Tracy " Mrs. Morrell " and to know she will be home , the way women are supposed to be when people do work on their houses . Tracy lives in an old farmhouse . " If do n't lock the door when I 'm out , " she says . " You can come in through the kitchen . " <p> But Larry will not leave the truck because the minute he approaches the door the dog gets up and stands across the threshold . Her yellow eyes glare . He has told Tracy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he mutters . " Oh , just push past her , " Tracy says . " Everyone else does . " No way I 'm going to push past that dog , Larry thinks . It is the second time he has come to the house and found no one home . The dog lies calm across the threshold in the June sun . She is as big as Rebel , the black lab his father took duck hunting when Larry was little . " Do n't pester Reb , Son , " his dad had said . " Quit that pulling on his tail . " Larry studies the shepherd . He has a sudden image of her twisting round on him the way Rebel had just before his world dissolved into a storm of growls and his ma 's shrieking . Larry 's wife , Ginny , tells him that dogs can smell fear . Larry thinks his fear must smell sour and sharp like sweat , but on a frequency only the dog can sense . He sends her a telepathic message . Leave . Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cats . He crosses his arms on the steering wheel and wishes he were anywhere else . <p> Tracy is not at the house because she is out running . Every morning she runs four or five miles . She runs until the breath is ragged in her chest and she is too tired to think about Posy , who is coming home for the summer . She has planned the bathroom to be Posy 's welcome-home surprise , but it will not be finished in time . The bathtub is n't installed yet . The worn pipes have n't been replaced . <p> " Look , " she said to Larry , " I 'm not asking for dramatic changes . Some new plumbing , new fixtures , copper pipes under the floor . It 's for my daughter . " Posy has shared Tracy 's bathroom until now . Tracy 's husband , whose hobby was photography , used this one as a darkroom . When he left , he took only the enlarger with him . For years Tracy let the rest of his equipment sit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Posy . <p> Tracy has been running on a regular basis since May when she sent Eric away . Eric is one of the winter-spring men she occasionally lets into her life . He is a Classics professor at the community college . This winter she enrolled in his course on Homer 's Odyssey , drawn by thoughts of sea voyages , vast horizons . They began living together in March , and although she thinks they may be in love , she asked him to leave before Posy came home . <p> " I do n't know why you feel you need to do this , " he said . <p> " Posy 's away at school so much . Summers are for her and me . Please , " she said . " You can come back in the fall . " She hoped she meant it . <p> As soon as Eric left , her body drew inwards , whimpered . Get a hold of yourself , Tracy said . She decided to start running . <p> She does not experience the euphoria she has read long-distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her legs and the sweat come up warm : first at her temples , then on her face , neck , arms . She runs seriously , as if she were in training . <p> No one seems to be around when Larry returns the next day , though Tracy 's car is in the driveway . The dog watches him from the door . She licks her right foreleg in long rhythmic strokes . She licks her foreleg constantly . The fur is discolored there , reddish brown . Larry does not want to honk to tell Tracy he is here . It embarrasses him to ask for help . Besides , today he has worked out a plan . " You watch this , dog , " he says . He climbs out the window of the cab and up to its roof . He intends to stand on the roof of the truck and jump up to the porch over the kitchen , where a door leads into the upstairs hall . He spreads out his arms to test the weight of the belt of tools at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is poised to jump , when he realizes a kid is standing by the dog with a glass of milk in her hand . Larry starts to blush , but then he sees the kid is n't normal . He does n't have to be embarrassed by her . She wo n't care if he 's on top of his truck or under it . She 's a mongoloid . He knows that 's not what they call them now , but his dad always said " mongolian idiot , " and what 's what he thinks when he sees her in the doorway . <p> " I 'm Posy , " she says . She takes a big swig of milk and it leaves a ring on her upper lip . " Why do n't you come in the door ? " she asks . <p> " I 'm scared of the dog , " he tells her . It feels good to say that aloud and not be ashamed . <p> " Jif 's twelve , " says Posy . " Like me . " <p> Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud , but not hard to understand . Shelley , his oldest , is twelve . Larry has never talked to a mongoloid before . He sits on the roof of the truck with his legs hanging over and looks down at her . She has the slanty eyes and the snub nose . Her mouth is a little open . There 's a grown man he sometimes sees in the supermarket who has Posy 's face . The man strikes Larry as repulsive and he wo n't stand in the same checkout line with him . Posy does not look repulsive , but Larry thinks that maybe this is because she 's still a kid and has n't had time to grow into being ugly . <p> " If I come in the door , " he says , " will you hold the dog 's collar ? " <p> " Sure , " says Posy . <p> He climbs off the truck and edges past them both . Once in the kitchen he feels breathless with relief . The kid comes in and takes his hand . He jumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It feels limp . <p> " Who 're you ? " she asks . <p> " I 'm the plumber , " he tells her . " I 'm putting in your bathtub . " <p> " There is no bathtub , " says Posy . <p> " There will be . I have to do some work first . " <p> " I like baths , " Posy announces . <p> " Do you ? " " I take showers , " Larry says . <p> Tracy comes downstairs and into the kitchen . " You have milk on your face , Posy . Wipe it off . " She puts her hand on Posy 's shoulder . <p> " She 's very affectionate , " Tracy says . " She 'll probably hug you a lot . " Posy 's hand is still in Larry 's . He wants her to take it away . <p> The day after Larry meets Posy he drives his son , Tommy , who is seven , to the local fair which was being set up all week in the field next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children there every year , but this summer Shelley says it 's a stupid fair and she 's tired of it , so Ginny stays home with her . Larry goes alone with Tommy be . cause he thinks fathers and sons should do things together . He did not get to do much along this line with his own father . Larry and Tommy go to the fair in the early evening . There were two thunderstorms in the afternoon . The lights on the ferris wheel shine down on sodden grass and pools of mud . Tommy does not think it is a stupid fair , but Larry , trailing behind him , tends to agree with Shelley . He keeps his eye on his son , as Tommy zigzags through the crowd . He has given Tommy a roll of tickets for the rides and five dollars for the games . He wonders if one day his son will make him cry the way he made his dad cry when Rebel had to be put to sleep . Tommy stops in front of a booth lined on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To win a prize Tommy has to burst one of the small balloons tacked to the backboard . For a dollar he gets three chances with three darts . <p> " You 're wasting your money , " Larry says . Tommy 's arm is not accurate enough . He puts out his dollars and the darts fall short or thud into the backboard . <p> Tommy has only a dollar left . He tums to the man running the concession . " My dad 's going to do it now , " says Tommy . He looks at his father . " I want a panda . " <p> The man gives Larry the darts and winks at him . " Win your son a prize , Dad , " he says . Larry weighs the darts in his hand . They seem reasonably balanced and there are a great many balloons tacked to the backboard . He picks out a blue one at eye level in the middle row and bursts it on his second throw . The man reaches down under the counter , brings out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of Tommy . " That 's not a panda . " Tommy is outraged . <p> " Listen , kid . See the number painted in the space where your Dad bust the balloon ? It says 1 . The 1 prizes are these here . You do n't get a panda less you uncover a 3 . " <p> " Where the hell are the 3 's then ? " asks Larry . <p> " Corner balloons , top row . " <p> Larry looks down at Tommy 's prize . " What is it ? " <p> " It 's a fish , " the man says . Tommy 's lip trembles . <p> Tracy does not run in the mornings now because she will not leave Posy alone in the house . She rises early to do yoga and meditate . It is a way of going away without going away . Beside her , in a square of pale sun which has begun to lengthen on the living-room carpet , a cassette tape instructs her to breathe through alternate nostrils and live wholly in the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Posy . The summer has dosed around them . <p> Tracy sits cross-legged on the rug . Her hands lie palm upward on her knees . " Let your thoughts float by like clouds , " the cassette says . " Watch them pass and let them go . " Tracy watches a thought glide through her mind . " I do not see her enough anymore . " It does not go away . <p> Posy spends ten months a year at her school . Tracy has not seen her since December , and December is not a good month for Posy . Christmas overstimulates her . She is loud , her behavior erratic . This year Tracy took her , as she always does , to her parents in New Jersey . Tracy 's parents make every effort to treat Posy as they would any other child . <p> " What do you think I should give her this year , dear ? " Tracy 's mother asked . " She 's so difficult to buy things for . " <p> " Do you know what she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toy one . " <p> " For heaven 's sake , whatever for ? " <p> " To clean her room at school . She says they only have brooms . " <p> " Well , that 's impossible , " said Tracy 's mother . " People do n't give children vacuum cleaners for Christmas . " <p> They 'd never let her keep it at school , Tracy said to herself . She considered buying a small manual sweeper , but she knew Posy was thinking of a Hoover with all the attachments . <p> In the end Tracy gave her a digital watch , which Posy wore for several days . <p> Now they wait through June for the bathroom to be finished . They walk through the tangled dropcloths in the upstairs hall . Pieces of plaster crunch between their bare toes . Posy stumbles and skins her knee on the heating element which leans against the door . Her room is cluttered with Larry 's tools , with chrome fixtures , towel racks , boxes of aquamarine tile . She has to sleep in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Posy . <p> " It was meant to be done by now , " Tracy tells her . <p> She watches her daughter dress and undress . Posy 's body is soft , dumpy . Like rising dough , it is full of changes . <p> " Sometimes these hurt , " Posy says , touching her nipples . She looks down at her abdomen and her eyes cross slightly . " I have hair , " she says proudly . <p> On weekends Tracy makes pancakes for breakfast . Posy often helps , but sometimes she prefers to lie on the kitchen floor and pull out clumps of Jifs undercoat . Jif sheds most of the summer and looks disreputable , as if she were molting . Soft , downy , gray tufts poke up through the black and tan pelt . Posy pulls handfuls of hair from the dog 's belly . Jif 's expression is pained . <p> " I 've told you so many times to stop that , " Tracy says . " Leave Jif alone , Posy . She 's old . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're twins . " <p> " It 's not the same . " Tracy flips a pancake that has started to bum . has been her dog as long as Posy has been her child . At night in bed Tracy listens to Jif 's nails click on the uncarpeted stairs as she makes her way to Tracy 's room . She drags her hindquarters a little and it takes her a long time . " Why do n't you stay downstairs , Jif ? " Tracy asks . Jif stands by the bed . Her tail sweeps back and forth . " You lie down , now . Go to sleep , " Tracy tells her . The dog moves away . She turns in slow , tight circles and at length collapses to the rug with a sigh . <p> Posy makes little hills of the downy hair and blows on them . " That fluff is going to go all over the kitchen , " Tracy says . " Leave the dog alone and come make pancakes with me . " <p> Posy wrinkles her nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jif stinks . " <p> " Oh , sweetheart , " says Tracy . " She 's old . You have to be kind . " <p> Larry sits with Ginny in their backyard after a barbecue supper . It is dusk . Fireflies stagger low and lazy above the grass . Tommy leaves the table and goes after them . He does not try to catch them . He watches and counts the blinks . <p> Larry is pleased because the work on Posy 's bathroom is almost completed . The bathtub is in , so is the toilet , the basin . Sub flooring has been laid down over the new copper pipes . Only the bath fixtures need to be put in place . Tomorrow he plans to put in the chrome faucet and spigots . At the moment a thin copper pipe extrudes from the tub . Posy likes it . She tums the water pressure on at the temporary spigot on the pipe and the water arcs in a thin silver stream into the center of the tub . " Fountain , " says Posy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catches the drops and takes them into her mouth . <p> " This woman I 'm doing a job for  --  " says Larry . <p> " The one with the dog , " says Ginny . She is cleaning off the table and her arms are filled with ketchup , mustard , and mayonnaise bottles . " Shelley , " she calls , " come out here and help clear the plates . " <p> Shelley comes to the screen door . <p> Larry says , " She has a mongoloid kid . " <p> " You do n't say that , Dad , " Shelley says . " You say Down 's syndrome . " This is the first time his daughter has told him something he does n't already know . Larry is impressed . Shelley goes to the table and begins to pitch used paper plates into the garbage can . Looking at her in the half-light he realizes she will soon be prettier than her mother . <p> " A kid from space , " Tommy says . He walks slowly toward them , a lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An android from Mongol . " He has seen Star Wars and E.T . twice . <p> " It means retarded , dummy , " says Shelley . <p> " I 'm not dumb , " says Tommy . " That kid is . " He thinks this is very funny . His hand jiggles and the firefly spirals upward . <p> Ginny comes over and sits by Larry . " Is it a boy or a girl ? " <p> Posy hovers in Larry 's mind , defenseless as the lightning bug Tommy permits to fly away . " She 's a girl . Shell 's age . Her name 's Posy . " <p> " How sad for the mother , " Ginny murmurs . <p> Larry remembers that on the wall of the bathroom upstairs Ginny hangs a calendar on which she writes " P " on the day of the month she gets her period . Very recently she has added " S P " to the calendar , with an exclamation point . His daughter has begun to menstruate and Ginny never told him . Ginny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she know things ? " Ginny asks . " Can she take care of herself ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Does she know who the President is ? " asks Tommy . <p> " I do n't know . Maybe . " <p> " I bet she does n't know all of them , " says Tommy . <p> Posy sits beside the shepherd in the doorway . When Larry comes up in his truck he waves to her . She waves back and puts her hand firmly on Jif 's collar . " I hold on to Jif It 's my job . " <p> " You hold tight , now , " Larry says . Nonetheless , Jif manages to lean against him . She pushes her nose into his crotch . Posy follows Larry upstairs into the bathroom where he lays out his tools on the windowsill . She stands behind him and shifts her weight back and forth on the boards to make them squeak . " Stop that , Posy , " Larry says . Posy continues to squeak the floorboards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methodically , " it was pretty . " Larry turns around . He feels the same way . Whenever he takes up corroded green pipes from a bathroom and replaces them with fresh copper , he likes to look at how the new lines run in gleaming rectangular patterns before they are covered up again . He and Posy look down at the thick boards . He knows they both see a maze of bright tubing . <p> " Who 's the President , Posy ? " <p> " Reagan , " says Posy . " And before that ? " <p> Posy 's eyes slide off to one side . " Lincoln ? " <p> " He was a president , too , " Larry agrees . <p> " I 'm swimming at the Y today , " says Posy . " I 'm coming home with Frankie and Teddy . More has a ' pointment . " <p> " Who 're Frankie and Teddy ? " <p> " They live around here , " she says vaguely . " They 're litfie kids . " <p> Tracy closes Jif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Y. " In case I 'm held up , " she says to Larry , " you 'll wait here for Posy , wo n't you ? " <p> " Yeah , sure . It 's my last day . I 'm not in no hurry . " <p> " I take lessons , " Posy tells him . <p> The gynecologist 's office is crowded and Tracy worries she will not get home before Posy returns from the Y. She fights the impulse to rise and leave because she has asked especially if the doctor can work her in . She wants to talk to him about Posy and sex . Circulating currents from the air conditioner move in the leaves of the rubber plant . Young , pregnant women read magazines and wait . Their waiting is luminous . The babies float inside their mothers , and Posy floats in the warm pool at the Y. Her short hair , silky as birth hair , plasters her forehead . The stubby fingers comb through the water . Tracy carries these images of Posy behind her eyes the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She leans back against the brown leather sofa cushions , doses her eyes . Very light ripples of pain slip towards her . They wash closer and the smooth fabric of the sofa at her neck begins to roughen . Now it feels like the dingy plush seat in the train Tracy took out from town after a pediatric consultation . Posy is small , not yet a year old , but she sleeps heavily against her mother 's shoulder , and Tracy 's arms feel numb . The specialist has given Tracy a book which she has buried deep in the bag which holds Posy 's diapers , bottle , bibs . She feels the book glow from within the bag . She can see its jacket drawing of a mother 's hand balancing an infant 's head . The infant sleeps on the suggested penciled curve of a shoulder . Its face is invisible . It could be anyone 's baby . Tracy holds Posy against her shoulder in the same way . Her daughter 's strange , secret face is not exposed . Tracy feels for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet her . Posy mutters , shifts , and settles , and the man across from her looks up from his paper . Tracy 's hand curves around the soft bones at the back of Posy 's head . The man across from her is not her husband . Her husband was not free that afternoon to come with her . He is no one she knows , a stranger . The waves have separated her from everyone who is not holding her child . She sees the men and women around her recede to pinpoints as Posy 's breath whispers in her neck and Posy 's body relaxes into hers . <p> Tracy opens her eyes in the gynecologist 's office and looks at her watch . Posy will be home now from the Y. Larry will be at the house . It will be all right . Posy likes Larry , She will miss him . " My friend , Larry , " she says . Tracy looks over at the receptionist who smiles at her . It is a special smile she reserves for mothers whose children have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the bedroom when she hears an unfamiliar car come up the drive . Larry has cleaned up . He checks to be sure he has all his tools . Then Posy starts to scream . She wails like a siren on one note . Larry races down the stairs . The dog hurls herself against the bedroom door as he passes . Her deep barking and the child 's screams come at him in waves . Posy is lying face down in the driveway . She has fallen out of the car because Teddy and Frankie tied her sneaker laces together . It is not Teddy and Frankie 's mother who brought her home . It is their babysitter , a teenager whose face is pasty with fright as she stands over Posy . She will not touch her to lift her up . Posy 's head is raised like a turtle 's . Her mouth is open and she has bitten her tongue , which bleeds heavily . Larry pulls her to her feet . The two little boys are crouched by the far window in the backseat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to untie the sneakers . Posy reaches out , grabs a fistful of his hair , and pulls hard . Her wail shrieks its single note into Larry 's skull along with fierce stabs of pain as she yanks on his hair . <p> " Jesus , Posy , let go . Let go , Posy ! " He did not know hairpulling could hurt this much . He begins to feel sick . Posy opens her hand . She stops wailing , but she cries so hard she shakes . The pain in Larry 's skull subsides . He can not untie the knot in her sneakers so he takes them off . Posy 's knees and shins have been cut by the gravel . There is blood on her legs and blood on her shirt from the bleeding tongue , but Larry does not think she is badly hurt . He sits Posy down on the front steps and goes to the car . Teddy and Frankie roll up the window . Larry brings his face close to the glass . They are no older than Tommy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants . <p> " Listen , you little turds , " he says against the glass . " You do that again and I 'll turn the dog on you . You hear that dog inside the house ? She 'll rip you to pieces , you do shit things like this again . " The babysitter has begun to cry . " Go home , " Larry tells her . " You should 're put her in the front seat . " <p> When the babysitter has left , Larry feels more alone than he can bear . Jif continues to bark upstairs , to push her body against the closed door . Posy 's face is bloated with tears . " Hey , " Larry says . " How 'd you like to wash off in your new bathtub ? It 's finished . " He urges her up the stairs . She seems to be putting her weight wrong . She is unbalanced . " Look where you 're going , Posy , " he says . His head still aches . The dog has stopped barking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They felled me , " Posy says in the bathroom . <p> Larry turns on the water . He expects Posy to sit on the edge of the tub and rinse her scraped legs with warm water , but there are no towels , washrags , or soap , and now Posy begins to undress . <p> " No , " Larry says , but she draws her T-shirt over her head and throws it to the floor . <p> " I 'm dirty , " Posy says . She pulls down her shorts . <p> " Okay then , leave your underpants on . " Posy is wearing cotton underpants . Little bears march around the elastic at the waist . Larry feels a band of fear tighten across his abdomen . In his mind 's eye he sees Tracy burst into the bathroom , he sees the dog leap for the soft flesh at his throat . He does not know why this is happening to him . He waits for Posy to climb into the tub by herself , but her body leans backwards against his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . He thinks he ought not to touch her . The knot of fear cramps his belly . <p> Posy slips as she sits in the shallow water and , without thinking , Larry kneels and puts his left arm across her back to steady her . Posy leans into his arm , stretches her legs straight out in front of her . With his right hand , Larry scoops up some water and sloshes it over her legs . He thinks the cuts must sting , but she has stopped crying . He feels the shudder of her breath and holds her more firmly . Dimly now , he remembers he once bathed Shelley and Tommy this way when they were infants . But he can not hold Shelley like this any longer , and Tommy he only pats on the back , or squeezes his shoulder . He wipes Posy 's face with his hand and she closes her eyes . <p> <p> By FRANCES STOKES HOEKSTRA <p>                    @
