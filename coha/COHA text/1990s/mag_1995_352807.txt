Two days before the 49ers were to meet the Dallas Cowboys in the de facto Super Bowl , Deion Sanders , the 49ers cornerback , Cincinnati Reds centerfielder and Bust It Records rap star , was asked if he would trade all his jewelry-some pawnshops have less-for one Super Bowl ring . Sanders paused , then lifted his sleeve to reveal not one , not two , but three ostentatious watches , and said , " Definitely . " Why three watches , you ask ? Simple : The man keeps Pacific , Eastern and Prime Time . <P> In some ways Sanders , a.k.a . Neon Deion ( which he hates ) and Prime Time ( which he embraces ) , seems from yet another time . He has Satchel Paige 's wit and flair for self-promotion , Cab Calloway 's sense of outrageous style and Jim Thorpe 's mind-boggling athletic ability . In the 49ers ' 38-28 victory over their nemesis , the Cowboys , on Jan. 15 , Sanders stifled the Dallas receivers , intercepted a crucial pass near the San Francisco goal line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was allowed to return a kickoff for the first time all season . He also demonstrated two of his many sides to Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman . Asked what he said to Aikman after helping the quarterback get off the ground after a sack , Sanders replied , " I told him to keep his head up and not get discouraged . Then I told him to throw me one . " And in the postgame press conference Sanders displayed his gift for hyperbole . Asked about his decision earlier this season to sign with the 49ers for much less money than he would have got from other teams , Sanders said , " Forget finances . I 'm knocking on the door of a dream . It was the greatest decision in the history of sports . " Hmmm , let 's see , there was the decision to integrate baseball , the decision to institute the forward pass . . . oh , never mind . <P> The real Super Bowl XXIX , which will be played this Sunday in Miami , will match the 49ers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five Super Bowls , against the six-feet-underdog San Diego Chargers , whose only useful purpose , it seems , is to make this the first all-California Super Bowl . The game will have added significance when Sanders takes the field : he will become the first player to participate in both the World Series and the N.F.L. championship . <P> He also may set records in the week preceding the Super Bowl for most column inches written about one player , most endorsements generated , and largest entourage . Because he grew up in Fort Myers , Florida , Prime Time will have more hangers-on than teammates in Miami . All the bodyguards and the dollar-sign medallions and the commercials and the flashy cars have tended to obscure the full range of his athletic talents . But even those who love to hate him , love to watch him . <P> He was recently named the N.F.L. 's Defensive Player of the Year , and he batted .283 this year with 38 stolen bases for the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds . In the 1992 World Series for the Braves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Braves traded him to the Reds in May , partly because the front office had tired of his act , but there are those who think that if he sticks to baseball , he might put up Rickey Henderson-like numbers .
