<p> For a sense of the continuity of the terrorist tradition in America , consider this actual sequence of events : The FBI smashes a dead-serious plot to overthrow the federal government and reveals that for more than a year the right-wing militias involved were undergoing army-style training , fired up by inflammatory talk radio . They planned to use their bombs , rifles , and machine guns to wages guerrilla warfare on American cities , and they claimed friends and allies in government and the military . They aimed , in one reporter 's words , to " bomb selected buildings , seize public utilities , blast bridges , terrorize Jews , appropriate Federal Reserve gold , assassinate fourteen Congressmen , and set up a dictatorship . " The goal : to remove all liberal and anti-Christian forces from government , not least the liberal President and his activist wife . This happened in January 1940 . <p> However you define it , terrorism has seldom been long absent from the American landscape . In this century we have endured attacks by anarchists and labor militants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out some spectacular actions , including a 1950 attack on President Truman 's home and a bloody 1954 assault on Congress . Cuban and Croat exile organizations have often been active on American soil . During the Vietnam years , the Weathermen and other leftist bodies undertook widespread bombing campaigns that peaked in 1969 and 1970 . <p> But the longest tradition of political terrorism lies on the ultra-right . The original Ku Klux Klan , during Reconstruction , was probably the biggest , most successful terrorist movement in American history , systematically practicing assassination , random murder , and intimidation . Since then , a succession of armed militias has arisen to combat a federal government supposedly usurped by conspiracies opposed to American liberties and values , starting with the " shirt " groups anti Christian Front of the thirties and continuing through the Minutemen and revived Klan of the sixties to the neo-Nazi militants who began to make their appearance in the eighties . Though the bombing in Oklahoma City represented a leap in scale , it was hardly new in introducing terrorism to America , in coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than international grievances . Americans have never needed instruction from abroad in launching the organized mayhem that we call terrorism . <p> The rebels whose ambitious plans open this article belonged to an organization called the Christian Front . In the late 1930s ultra-right , fascist , and anti-Semitic groups flourished in the United States , and some were violent . Their threats of terrorism and armed insurrection , largely forgotten today , caused wide concern , and the crisis did not abate until it was replaced by the far more immediate dangers of the Second World War . <p> That past experience with terrorism holds real lessons , both about what drives people to such extreme actions and about what can counter them . The Christian Front terrorists of the late 1930s were motivated by ideas and concerns almost identical to those of today 's white-supremacy movements and armed militias . And then as now , the government took actions that backfired and may have actually increased support for the dissidents . <p> The Christian front was but one of several hundred ultra-right and anti-Semitic organizations in 1930s America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the thousands . The best known included the German-American Bund , which aped the military style and rhetoric of Nazi Germany , and the Silver Legion , or Silver Shirts , led by William Dudley Pelley . The Silver Shirts ' more than twenty thousand members , concentrated mainly in the West , trained openly for armed confrontation . Their field marshal Roy Zachary gained national renown in 1938 by announcing that if no one else was prepared to assassinate President Roosevelt , he 'd do it himself . Zachary and Pelley became popular speakers for the far-right groups and clubs that sprang up all over the country in 1936 and 1937 , amid the New Deal and a wave of labor unrest . In these organizations , few doubted that communism was simply a front for Jewish conspiracy , a belief fomented in that notorious forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion . <p> Probably the most dangerous group was the Christian Front , founded by the radio-show host Father Charles E. Coughlin . Coughlin was originally a supporter of the New Deal , but like many Catholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many on the American far right saw the war , begun in 1936 when the right-wing armed forces of Spain rebelled against a democratically elected leftist coalition , as a life-and-death struggle between Christian civilization and Jewish-backed communism . By 1938 Coughlin was saying on his weekly radio show that the Jews had started the Russian and Spanish revolutions and would soon turn America 's cities into " another Barcelona . " He exhorted his listeners to arm , train , and organize a Christian Front against the Red Front . <p> This Christian Front was to be paramilitary , made up of platoons that would constitute a national militia some five million strong . The first Christian Front units assembled clan-destinely in New York City in the summer of 1938 ; over the next year they spread to Boston , Philadelphia , Cleveland , and other major cities in the East and Midwest . <p> They engaged in street violence from the start , their members attacking Jewish-owned businesses and Jews in the streets . And Coughlin warned that that was only the beginning . Whenever the Front organized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed up to tell recruits to train and arm under the guise of sporting or rifle clubs . At a Philadelphia meeting in 1939 , Bishop urged members to procure machine guns . <p> The talk of weapons was more than just bluster . The Front claimed hundreds of supporters in the New York City and New York State police departments alone . Informants reported that the Front was obtaining ammunition from Fort Dix and other Army bases , where it was said to have the sympathy of senior military officers . It maintained a clandestine Revolutionary Council to coordinate military training and plan possible attacks . <p> The flavor of that underworld is captured in a brilliant expose , Under Cover , published in 1943 by " John Roy Carlson , " the pseudonym of an Armenian-American journalist named Arthur Derounian . In 1939 Derounian , posing as an anti-Semitic reporter and organizer , undertook to infiltrate ultra-right groups . He spent four years under cover testing the scale and seriousness of the militias , and he met many zealots who openly espoused armed conflict . Some boasted a bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be pretty good soon , and we are practicing . " Another predicted " the boys " would " dynamite Detroit , Pittsburgh , Chicago  --  paralyze transportation and isolate whole sections of the country . . . A bloodbath is the only way out . " <p> Much of their talk was clearly fantastical , but Derounian also watched them in action . He visited the Midtown Sporting Club , in New York City , a cover for members of the Iron Guard , a parallel to the Christian Front . Iron Guard members , who used the Hitler salute , mapped " very arsenal , subway station , power house , police and gasoline station , public building . . . " to prepare for an armed rising . The club 's leader told Derounian : " I 'd like to be able to pick up the paper someday and read ' Grand Central Station Bombed , ' ' The White House Blown to Bits , ' or ' Queen Mary Sunk at Her Dock . ' " <p> That such threats were taken seriously is suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England visited America in 1939 , a massive mobilization of police and military personnel that seems unremarkable by today 's standards but was astonishing at the time . Every bridge and culvert the royal train passed on its way from Niagara Falls to Washington , D.C , was under constant guard by officers who had been instructed to watch for rail sabotage and " for the throwing of a bomb or hand grenade by someone standing in a crowd or someone passing in an automobile . . . for someone sniping from a hillside with a rifle or someone in a crowd firing at the trains . " <p> The fear of ultra-right terrorism climaxed in January 1940 , when the leaders of the Christian Front were arrested in Brooklyn . Seven men , including Bishop , were charged with running a secret organized militia disguised as a sporting club . Newspapers showed photographs of their cache of weapons and ammunition . The Front was said to be in contact with both the German government and IRA terrorists planning attacks on British targets in North America . In the jittery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thefts of explosives in several states , suggesting that these might be connected with the radical right , and allegations followed that various accidents at industrial or defense plants had been the work of saboteurs from pro-Nazi groups . <p> Violent 1930s organizations like the Christian Front grew in a political soil that at first glance seems quite different from that of contemporary America . They could recruit easily from a population impoverished and demoralized by years of Depression , and anti-Semitism was far more widespread and accepted in an age that had yet to experience the Holocaust . But there are close analogies across time . The past two decades , like the thirties , have produced an extremist political culture that sees the American government and social order as so corrupt and dangerous it is the primary threat to the well-being of its citizens . The Coughlinites played particularly on anti-Jewish and pro-Axis sentiment , while the modern extreme right sees a wide range of threats to traditional values and social structure : affirmative action and desegregation ; the transformation of the family and the relationship between the sexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In both cases , an especial peril has been that of uncontrolled immigration destroying forever the idealized white America of bygone days ; just as the specter of mass Jewish immigration ( " refujews " ) stirred American anti-Semitism to new heights in 1938 and 1939 , so has large-scale Asian and Hispanic immigration inflamed today 's far right . And extremists of both eras have been united in their anxiety over a loss of national sovereignty to international institutions and " one world " movements . <p> One thing that often distinguishes extremists from the merely disaffected is their sense of a hidden purpose underlying events : Bad things do n't just happen ; they are somebody 's plan  --  and the bigger the evil , the more powerful the forces behind it . The primary villain in the thirties was the federal government , and it is again today , not only actively sinister in its own right but also used as a tool by clandestine financial interests . In the 1930s the supposed international forces undermining American society were Zionist , led by " President Rosenfeld " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups vary about who exactly is subverting America , but many subscribe to the old anti-Semitic scheme and recite the same familiar names of Jewish magnates and bankers . <p> By far the most influential text and manual for the modern revolutionary right is a 1978 novel , The Turner Diaries , written pseudonymously by a leader of the radical right , William L. Pierce . It presents a harrowing account of an imaginary racial war in the 1990s , in which white " patriots " led by a terrorist group called the Order orchestrate a bloody and ultimately successful revolution against the existing " Zionist Occupation Government . " The acronym ZOG has entered the vocabulary of the far right from the novel and has helped shape extremists ' concepts of their enemy . Though the term ZOG was unknown to the Coughlinites. it exactly catches their world-view . The Turner Diaries has so influenced real events that in the 1980s an actual group took the name the Order anti began a two-year campaign modeled on the one in the book . In 1983 they even plotted a bomb attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Oklahoma City . And the Oklahoma bombing itself bears a startling resemblance to a scene in the book where a truck bomb destroys FBI headquarters in Washington , killing hundreds . Among other things , the explosive used is identical , and so is the time of day . <p> Just as the militias of both eras have shared a powerful anti-Semitic strain , so have they conformed in identifying themselves as " Christian . ' In Coughlin 's day dozens of rightist outfits used " Christian " in their names , as many do today . But while the terminology is the same , the meaning has shifted . The kinds of Christians who followed Coughlin held relatively ordinary religious views ; their more recent counterparts have been increasingly influenced by the Christian Identity movement . This sees white Northern Europeans  --  " Aryans "  --  as the authentic heirs of biblical promises and covenants , by virtue of their descent from the lost Tribes of Israel ; Jews are false claimants to Hebraic status and are of the devil . These ideas were pioneered by Depression-era race theorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they constitute a direct link between contemporary white-supremacy extremism and the fringe thought of Coughlin 's day . <p> Viewing the government as the enemy is all the easier if the government actually carries out policies that can be claimed to pose a direct threat to the lives and safety of the population . Current antigovernment extremists have been inspired by the death and destruction at Waco in 1993 and other armed confrontations ; the Waco siege was the chief stimulus for the growth of militias over the last two years , a uniquely powerful symbol because it specifically represented an apocalyptic confrontation between the government and a church  --  the ZOG destroying a Christian body . <p> In the late 1930s there were two comparable stimuli . The Spanish Civil War was viewed in terms quite as prophetic as Waco : a direct , murderous confrontation between the forces of religion and those of communism , a model for what might be inflicted on America . Then by 1939 the main obsession shifted to fear that the United States might be lured into World War II on the Allied side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds ; extremists did so because it would consummate Roosevelt 's rise to dictator . Ultimately , hundreds of thousands of lives would be lost so that control of the country could be surrendered to Jewish interests . This bizarre view justified and even necessitated armed violence to preserve American society . As in the 1990s , rightist terrorism was upheld as national self-preservation . <p> In both eras access to weapons became a critical issue too . In the mid-1930s Congress passed the first federal gun-control law , banning the private possession of automatic weapons and machine guns . This aroused nothing like the furor over recent restrictions on assault rifles , but then as now such federal controls were depicted as an attempt to disarm the American people so they could be tyrannized  --  and then as now one response was military-style training and organization . Infiltration of the armed services in order to obtain weapons and supplies was a recurrent theme in exposes of the Christian Front and its contemporaries , and since the 1980s modern paramilitary groups have been charged with the same thing . Once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it should be done . All in all a very small step leads from the 1930s underworld described by John Roy Carlson to the 1980s and 1990s one represented by the Order in both its fictional and real-life manifestations . <p> If the violent extreme right of the 1930s was so similar to that of today , then we should be able to learn from that generation 's experience  --  from both its success in destroying the groups so thoroughly and its various failures as well . One important question to consider is whether extremism is best confronted or ignored . Today and in the 1930s alike , many people have held extremist views without the least likelihood of ever actually becoming violent . For a government , a critical goal is to ensure that those peacefully disaffected do n't progress to the next stage of active armed resistance . This can be a tough challenge . Following the Oklahoma City bombing , President Clinton won both praise and blame for his effort to associate the tragedy with a climate of hatred and suspicion fostered by the far right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other groups that had been largely ignored in the mainstream press , but it could be dangerous as well . <p> In this context the 1930s offer mixed lessons . The Coughlinite movement arose in a comparable environment , inspired by a popular radio personality with a mass audience of loyal followers . Once Coughlin embarked on his anti-Jewish crusades , people began to feel he was actively encouraging intolerance and racial violence and started urging that his broadcasts be controlled or suppressed . These calls became overwhelming following Germany 's Kristallnacht attacks on Jews in November 1938 , and stations in New York and other cities announced that they would refuse to carry his programs without first reviewing his scripts . But this permitted Coughlin to pose as a martyr , and his supporters found in the situation final proof that the media were under Red and Jewish control . They organized mass pickets of the offending radio stations and turned out thousands of demonstrators a week for months afterward ; the rallies became the major source of recruitment for the growing Christian Front . In the end the attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories of people already deeply suspicious of the government . It may have actually increased racist agitation . <p> Though that attempt to silence Coughlin was a disaster , the Roosevelt administration hoped to fare better with the arrest of his Christian Front followers , which might discredit the extreme right by portraying the whole anti-Semitic underworld as a realm of terrorists and their disciples . But problems soon arose . The political cost of putting a Catholic priest on trial made it impossible to prosecute Coughlin himself or any of the fire-eating anti-Semitic clergy in the Brooklyn diocese . Even militants as outspoken as Bishop were difficult to convict , because seeking to overthrow the government is very hard to prove . <p> Once the Christian Front trial got under way , in early 1940 , defense lawyers alleged that the whole case was a government frame-up and showed that at least one of the main activists was an FBI double agent . This raised the perennial problem of counterterrorist policing . Any law-enforcement agency worth its salt will try to find informants within potentially violent groups and plant agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are revealed , defendants can argue that the agents were either provocateurs trying to entrap them or liars describing imaginary plots to please their superiors . The defense is likely to assert that the informant himself first suggested acts of violence or took seriously talk to which no one else gave any weight . Juries are often convinced by these arguments . Indeed , accusations about police informants have been the major source of controversy in the trial of Muslim fundamentalists accused of planning bomb attacks around New York City . <p> In 1940 the prosecutors seeking convictions against the Christian Front discovered that they faced an uphill struggle . They had to work with a hostile jury , which probably included some Coughlin sympathizers . The trial effectively collapsed by midyear , with the accused returning to a heroes ' welcome in Brooklyn . Coughlin himself , ecstatic , proclaimed , " God bless . . . the Christian Front ! " and he redoubled his efforts until the outbreak of war permitted the government to close his newspaper and finally silence him . The failure of the trials damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It made the Justice Department much more cautious about pressing criminal charges against potential terrorist or subversive groups , and it raised public doubts about the seriousness of the charges and the conduct of the FBI . Some Republican congressmen dismissed the whole idea of armed militias as a red herring meant to ensure Roosevelt 's re-election in 1940 . <p> Perhaps law-enforcement officials should bear this precedent in mind over the coming months , as prosecutors formulate charges related to the Oklahoma affair . American courts have always been willing to convict individuals of specific acts of terrorist violence , but only as long as the prosecutions did n't appear to be political or attempt to use one incident to stigmatize a whole movement or subculture . The Christian Front trial was one of many in which juries simply refused to believe wide-ranging charges of sedition or revolutionary conspiracy , even when the evidence may have seemed over-whelming to a casual observer . Another example is the 1988 acquittals of the right-wing leaders accused of involvement with the Order 's terrorist schemes . The administration might want to cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City calamity , but past experience suggests that this would be counterproductive and even perilous . <p> Some thirty years ago Richard Hofstadter published his classic essay on what he called " the paranoid style in American politics . " He argued that a strand of conspiracy politics , defining events in terms of a constant struggle between good and evil , could be traced through all of American history . Successive generations have blamed the nation 's problems on villains ranging from Illuminati and Freemasons through Catholics , Communists , and Jews . Hofstadter 's analysis certainly applies to both the Coughlinites and the modern far right , but his account does n't address how often conspiracy theories have led to actual organized armed violence and active terrorism . Until recently , perhaps even until Oklahoma City , Americans tended to think of terrorism as a foreign menace that could somehow be excluded from our shores . But it has indeed happened here , on numerous occasions , and the perpetrators would often have described themselves as patriotic Christian Americans . Today 's militias are only the most recent manifestation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no historical newcomer in this country is not to trivialize recent events but to appreciate what is in fact a powerful , if little understood , thread in American political history . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Five members of the Christian Front among eighteen who were arrested by the FBI in Brooklyn in January 1940 . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Silver Shirts listen to the weekly screed written by their leader , William Dudley Pelley , in 1939 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Norman Olson , head of the Michigan Militia , in his gun shop before a wanted poster of the President . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The South Michigan Regional Militia Wolverines , 14th Brigade , 4th Division , train in snowy woods , 1994 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A current-day militia member 's Doberman pinscher wears both a chain collar and a bullet necklace . <p> By Philip Jenkins <p> <p> Philip Jenkins is a professor of history and religious studies at Pennsylvania State University .
