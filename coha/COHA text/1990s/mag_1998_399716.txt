A new flower garden is the proverbial blank page . Anything is possible , and that is the problem . Where do you begin ? Start with what you like .

Photograph Rose verbena adds bright color to the front of a bed . // Choose your favorite color or color combinations . Remember , you do n't have to grow everything . It 's like planning a meal . You decide on the main dish , and then everything else is chosen to go along with it . If creating a color scheme is intimidating , use only one . Some of the most effective gardens are a single color . Given a color scheme , make a list of the perennials and annuals that will grow in your area . Then consider the sun and soil , and strike the ones that are not adapted to the growing conditions in your garden . The first rule of thumb is to arrange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle , and tall in back . The second rule is to use a minimum of three plants of any type to make a clump or pod . But feel free to plant more than three to make a sweep of color . Place groups of plants that look good together next to each other . Plants complement each other in many ways . Perhaps they bloom at the same time in harmonious colors . Maybe they bloom at different times , giving you color over a longer period . One might be upright while the other is trailing , or one has a V-shaped form that is interesting next to a round mound .

GET THE HEIGHT RIGHT The perennials in the chart at left are all sun-loving , but they give you a place to start .
