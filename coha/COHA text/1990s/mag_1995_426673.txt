<p> It was 8:25 a.m. at the campus children 's center at the University of Milwaukee Day Care Center . Children had been arriving since 7:00 a.m . Some parents were saying their goodbyes . Others had long since gone and their children were playing alone or in small groups in different parts of the room . <p> A man standing about 6 feet in height entered the room , holding the hand of his two and a half year old son , Justin . He signed in on the sign-in sheet . Then he lightly pulled off Justin 's ski hat by the tassel as he walked across the room to the refrigerator with his son . As his dad held the refrigerator door open , Justin placed his yellow lunch box on one of the shelves . Justin walked across the room toward some small manipulative toys lying on a round table , his father following closely behind , jacket open , hands in his pockets . <p> Justin sat in a small chair at the table . His father sat in another , his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up several small toy trees and cars , talking about the pieces as they handled them . A teacher walked behind Justin 's dad , who turned to greet her . He stayed a few more minutes , then kissed his son on the forehead and left to go to class . <p> It is 9:30 a.m. at the Children 's Day Care Center at Tulane University in New Orleans , Louisiana . A three year old non-English speaking child and his mother , who is studying on a scholarship to complete her graduate classes , arrive at the center . The little boy clutches his mother 's arm and leg as she encircles him and talks to the teacher . <p> The teacher begins to show the little boy some toys on a table . As he clings to her , the mother gently encourages her son to play with the toys . The mother remains a few moments longer , hugging her son . Then she releases him to the teacher , who guides him to a table to play with some stickers . The mother then leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Campus <p> Although children 's programs have existed on campuses since the turn of the century , their focus has changed significantly in the last two decades . The first program noted in the literature was a campus laboratory school established by John Dewey in 1896 at the University of Chicago . In 1916 , a parent cooperative was established by the faculty at the University of Chicago . <p> During the 1920s , centers provided a forum for studying children , training teachers and educating parents . Usually sponsored by academic departments , these early centers were generally half day or extended-day models where all children arrived and went home at the same time . <p> During the 1930s and 1940s , laboratory nursery schools on campuses doubled . Universities and colleges expanded their educational facilities to provide training for increasing numbers of personnel employed first in the emergency nursery schools of the Depression , and then in the Lanham child care centers in operation during World War II . <p> The 1950s and 1960s were a period Goodlad called the " Education Decades . " The ideas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the impact of poverty on large numbers of families , and the civil rights movement prompted universities and colleges to devise innovative programs designed to aid poor children . <p> The era of the 1970s saw a rise in the number of nontraditional students , the advancement of women 's issues , and growth in the student activist movement that was born in the 1960s . These developments stimulated a redirection of the campus child care movement and set the stage for an increase in the number of centers . Centers began operating on a shoestring , often with alternative and fee for service funding rather than direct funding from the college . <p> These efforts , which were grassroots local responses to the need for children 's centers on campus , occurred on all types of campuses  --  large and small , two and four-year , urban and rural , and public and private . On each campus , originators were virtually reinventing the wheel . <p> The 1980s saw yet another upsurge of interest in child care centers , including a re-emergence of faculty and student activity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs related to their centers and made design modifications based on their needs . <p> Some campus children 's centers took a comprehensive approach . A center would start with one component  --  perhaps a center-based program  --  and add as needed home-based , resource and referral , and school age components . A few campus programs focused on student access and work/ family concerns through voucher systems , tuition assistance and emergency care services . <p> Several programs with limited budgets or limited populations to serve developed consortiums or partnerships , often with institutions off campus . Some campus centers that were successful in finding funding devised programs offering family day care , home support and training , and more recently , broadly conceptualized family services . How many programs are there ? <p> A 1987 study of 184 centers holding membership in the National Coalition for Campus Child Care reported on the numbers and ages of children enrolled in campus centers . Herr reported that infants under one year old were served by approximately 33% of the centers ; toddlers from age one to two were served by 65% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four were served by 98% of the centers ; and children ages five and six were served by 84% of the centers . <p> Fifty four percent of the 184 programs provided full day care ; 61% offered half day care . Most of the centers could accommodate 50 or fewer children . Children over six years of age were served by only 28% of the centers . Twenty percent of the centers also offered drop-in , temporary care , requiring little or no notice to satisfy parents ' unpredictable needs . <p> Fourteen percent of the centers offered evening care and 4 percent provided weekend care . More centers reported to student services or student affairs divisions than any other units . ( Herr et al. , 1987 ) <p> In terms of program focus , a 1989 national survey of campus child care programs indicated that approximately 42% of campus child care programs have a combined service education emphasis , 40% of the programs have a specific service emphasis , and 18% have a specific education emphasis . ( Herr &; Zimmerman , 1989 ) <p> In a survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officers and published in the May 1995 NACUBO Business Officer , 45.6% of colleges and universities reported the provision of child care services . Seventy three percent reported self operation of a campus children 's center . ( Anderson et al. , 1995 ) Kinds of Centers <p> Campus child care centers may assume a variety of forms . Each center will differ in sponsorship , organization , operations , support systems , staff patterns , and educational and service features . For example , some programs are housed within schools or education departments ; others are located in home economics departments ; and still others are situated within student or personnel services divisions or in family housing . <p> Programs may have all-day , half-day , evening , or weekend schedules or any combination of these . Children may be infants , toddlers , preschoolers , school age children , or any combination of these . The program may accept only children of students , or any combination of children of students , faculty , staff and community . Some programs are small , serving only 10 to 20 children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their programs to meet particular community needs . <p> For example , while there are campus children 's programs in every college within the City University of New York ( CUNY ) system , they differ markedly in design . One center at New York Technical College has an infant toddler room , two preschool classrooms , a teenage mothers ' program , a foster grandparent program , a Saturday cultural arts program , and a food co-op . The Borough of Manhattan Community College has a flexible scheduled program designed as part of the college space , where preschool children are enrolled based upon a random drawing each semester of those who have applied . The college has added a satellite of family day care centers in order to support more families . <p> Bronx Community College Child Development Center features a program for preschoolers and one for school age children , as well as a developing family day care network , a food buying club and CDA training . <p> The San Juan Child Development Center , an accredited center located at San Juan College in Farmington , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early childhood , nursing and psychology , and provides quality programs for the children of families at the college . The center operates two different multiage programs . Observation rooms and a college classroom are part of the center , which provides resource and referral services and lunch-time seminars on child development for students , parents , staff and community . <p> At Gallaudet , a liberal arts university for heating impaired students in Washington , D.C. , the Child Development Center offers an early childhood program for children of university staff , faculty and students . The center enrolls persons with hearing impairments , speech-language delays , physical disabilities , and developmental delays . Fifty percent of the parents are deaf and 50 percent of the teachers are deaf . <p> The child care center at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee was developed in the early 1970s to meet the need for flexibly scheduled child care for students attending classes . This NAEYC accredited program has expanded to accommodate the child care needs of faculty and staff . It offers a wide range of full- and part-time options for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through 11 years . It is used extensively as a research and training site for the School of Education and other departments . The child care center staff at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee have developed and taught college level courses using their own expertise and facilities that are targeted specifically to community child care workers . Establishing a Campus Children 's Center <p> The first step in developing a campus child care center is to ask how your institution , within its setting , can provide quality , affordable , accessible early childhood care and education that will serve as a model for the campus and surrounding community . Start with a broad vision : The committee that initiates development should decide on the program 's mission , funding source , location and governance . <p> Refine the design further through a survey to determine which services are needed at present . Who are the parents to be served ? How old are the children ? What times of day are services needed ? Programs of this complexity normally take shape slowly : Allow at least three years for initial development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing publicity . Programs are dynamic ; their structure must incorporate processes for continuous monitoring and feedback and the flexibility to respond to ever changing needs . <p> The National Coalition for Campus Child Care Inc. recommends that all programs seek accreditation within three years , pay professional salaries and become an integral part of the university structure . The Coalition , which has been instrumental in developing a body of literature on campus children 's programs , often provides resources and recommends consultants to colleges and universities interested in setting up programs . How campus children 's programs support children and families <p> In Living the Possible Dream : The Single Parent 's Guide to College Success , Riley writes , " Sometimes our campus centers are the best because there is a real mixture of children of different nationalities and ethnic and racial backgrounds . In addition , the people staffing these on-campus centers know about the concerns and pressures of a student parent . <p> " Many of these centers also give first priority for space to children of single parent students , especially students who live on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on campus child care centers are your best bet , too , for convenience , reliability and security for your child . . . . You will also be close enough to drop in on occasion , and it wo n't take a lot of extra time to take your children there and pick them up . " ( pp. 69-70 ) <p> A study of student parents at community colleges reveals a strong relationship between the existence of centers on campus and academic success for student parents . More than 80% of the survey 's student parents reported that child care availability was very important in their decision to attend college . In fact , 46% asserted that campus child care was a first priority factor that facilitated college enrollment . <p> Almost 60% of the student parents indicated that they would not have been able to continue attending college without the child care services . Once student parents were academically successful in their first semester , more than 26% increased their course load in the following semester . More than 95% again cited child care as crucial in making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of New York , responses by parents who were interviewed during an evaluation study of the CUNY campus centers were similar to those cited in the study above . Students ' comments about the programs and their needs were as follows : I feel more secure knowing my child is in school with me . I feel that the center is well organized in meeting the children 's developmental needs and that the teachers are qualified and care about the children . This is the best center of all those I have visited . I trust the day care staff to take care of my child while I am at class or studying . It is a well trained staff that is sensitive to the cultures and backgrounds of all the children . The center provides for open education that emphasizes creative learning . I am grateful for this center . It has allowed me to pursue my education with peace of mind and the confidence that my son is getting the best care . This is not just a babysitting service  --  it is an educational and cultural program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facilities are good . Without the center , I would have had to delay my goals . If there were no child care , I would stay at home and continue on welfare . I would not attend college until I found suitable child care . I would probably drop out of school until I found good day care for my child . Without this center , I probably would have postponed my education because the center my son previously attended turned out to be completely unsatisfactory . Not having this school for my child to attend would be my worst nightmare . Without this program , I could not attend classes or work . I looked for a long time before I found a place that I would even consider for my child . Without the center , I would not be able to attend school because we do not have the money to pay for a sitter . The center fills a great need for students like me who would not be able to continue getting an education because of the need for child care . The program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the support it has given me . The Outlook for Campus Children 's Programs <p> In Creating the New American College , Ernest L. Boyer writes , " Consider the condition of our children . Given such conditions , can colleges and universities honestly conclude that the crises confronting America 's children are someone else 's problems ? Campus children 's centers have a leadership role in child care and early education . At the present time , current forces influencing the early childhood field press for an expanded base of professional leadership and support . " ( Boyer , 1994 ) <p> " From an evolutionary perspective the provision of supportive ' Third Party ' leadership describes a role that could be assumed by a growing number of campus child care programs to enhance the professional development of the early childhood field . " ( p. 32 , Burton , Boulton ) <p> The evolution in the role and functions of campus child care programs will be shaped by the nature of social and educational forces as well as by college and university support . But with college and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges of providing quality child care and early education . <p> Campus child care programs can serve as models for the community , as advocates for children , and as resources for other departments and programs on campus , demonstrating the integration of theory and practice in both their training programs and service deliveries . They can network , train child care providers of the future , develop effective partnerships with parents and build alliances of support to enhance the lives of America 's children and families . <p> Further information on campus children 's programs may be obtained by writing to the National Coalition for Campus Child Care Inc. , P.O.
