Like most African Americans , I have the legacy of slavery written all over my face . My brow , for example , resembles that of my father 's father , who was born a slave in northern Florida . The sponsor 's slogan for the powerful series Africans in America , which aired on PBS last week , rightly insisted that the story of slavery is not just African-American history but American history . But for blacks like me , it 's also family history , a link to the oppressive past so intense and personal that it stares back whenever we look in a mirror . <P> That may be why I was n't moved more by the PBS series and Beloved , Oprah Winfrey 's movie version of Toni Morrison 's soul-searing novel . Both productions were excellent , but it 's not exactly news that slavery was a horrible crime . I wish we could throw as much energy and emotion into solving the gritty racial problems that we face today as we pour into condemning the sins of the past . <P> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides too often assume that the rationale for efforts to get blacks a fair share of jobs , government contracts and slots in elite universities is to make up for historic oppression . But that is preposterous . We do n't need affirmative action because our ancestors were slaves ; we need it because so many of us are still being denied opportunities because of our race . <P> As former Princeton University president William G. Bowen and former Harvard University president Derek Bok argue in their new book , The Shape of the River , a major justification for making sure that promising minority students can get into the best universities , even if their SAT scores are lower than those of some white applicants , is that " American society needs the high-achieving black graduates who will provide leadership in every walk of life . " In other words , to make sure that our future is shaped by all our citizens , not just a few . Slavery has nothing to do with it . <P> Nor does it have much connection to the academic performance gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in affluent and well-integrated suburbs like Shaker Heights , Ohio . According to the Washington Post , though blacks make up just over half of Shaker Heights ' student body , they account for 84% of those who get Ds or Fs in at least one major subject after the fifth grade . Most black students in Shaker Heights enjoy at least middle-class status . The school system has created special programs to boost black students ' test-taking skills . Counseling is available for those with strong potential but low test scores . So far , nothing has worked very well  --  because some black folks wo n't let it . <P> High-achieving black students who study hard complain that their less successful peers castigate them for " acting white . " One black counselor said black students should not take difficult advanced-placement courses because they would n't do well in them . You could argue that such self-destructive behavior reflects a so-called slave mentality , but history suggests otherwise . The newly emancipated freedmen valued two things above all else : their own land and education . They certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
