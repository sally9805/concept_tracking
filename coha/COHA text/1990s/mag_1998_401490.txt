Photograph Puff yourself up : There 's a plus side to upping your ego . // You know who we 're talking about : The dude who sidles into a room like he owns it . Who believes he 's entitled to date supermodels , even if he looks like a tree elf . Who thinks he deserves that big promotion , even if he has n't had a fresh idea since A Flock of Seagulls was on the charts . He may be maddening , but there 's actually a lot we can learn from this guy  --  and from most men , really . Because men seem to have been born knowing a salient fact of life : If you do n't believe you deserve the best-and go ahead and take it-no one will come over and hand it to you . Women often have a tough time with this concept . We tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to various reports , including those published in Brain Sex : The Real Differences Between Men &; Women by Anne Moir and David Jessel ( First Carol , 1991 ) , women 's tendency toward passivity and men 's toward aggression may be biologically determined , having to do with brain and hormonal differences between males and females . That , combined with the fact that many parents raise their sons to he combative and girls to be nice , means " power is a difficult concept for women , " says Marion Rudin Frank , Ph.D. , a Philadelphia psychologist . " They want it , but they think that if they have too much of it , people might not like them . " Sound familiar ? Some of us want to avoid making waves so badly , we feel sheepish about going after , say , the corner office because someone else might want it . Or we try to downplay our successes-after all , it might make others feel bad . Guys , on the other hand , do a much better job of understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a winner . Of course , being a winner is not the same as being a jerk . We 're not asking you to start barking orders at your secretary or crowing about how much beer you were able to put away last night . But if you want to win the traditional male booty-a man-size salary , better opportunities at work , instant respect , and all-around preferential treatment by everyone from dry cleaners to mechanics-take these tips . As you 'll see here , believing that you 're entitled to good things is the first step toward getting them . EGO-TRIP TIP 1 Brashly brag to yourself that you can do anything . So you have the big job interview , the crucial presentation , the hot date . But you 're nervous , worried , not sure you can pull it off . So do what a typical guy would do : Fake it . Pretend you 're the smartest , sexiest , most capable person ever . Not only will it work  --  most people are far too deep into their own insecurities to notice you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it yourself . Rich Thompson* did it by employing that oh-so-male strategy of going on the offensive when you 're feeling defensive . Thompson , 32 , was approached by a large fashion house and asked if his tiny New York City boxer-shorts company could fill a hige order . " The bubble over my head read I 'm not sure , " says Thompson . But instead of saying that , he fired off questions . " I threw out all this technical jargon that I barely knew myself : What 's your LDP date ? What 's the thread count ? They were so busy assuring me that they had their act together that they never got around to assessing how capable I was , " says Thompson . The result : He landed the job . " That order took my company to a new level . " So go all out to fake confidence and you 'll start to feel it . Puff up your chest like you see men do at the gym before they try to bench-press way too much weight , then revel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I rule , I rule , I rule . " And if you stand up straighter and look people directly in the eye , " it will actually make you feel more powerful , " says Mariah Burton Nelson , author of Embracing Victory : Life Lessons in Competition and Compassion ( William Morrow , 1998 ) . " The posture itself instills confidence in a person , " she says . EGO-TRIP TIP 2 Let yourself off the hook . Like a lot of women , Vanessa Tibor , 26 , a data analyst in Washington , D.C. , tends to heat herself up whenever she makes a mistake . " If I go into a job interview and I feel like I said something dumb , I 'll keep replaying the whole thing in my mind , just saying , Oh , you were so stupid . " Many men , on the other hand-if they even admit to having made a mistake-forgive themselves pretty easily . That 's because they know that part of getting anywhere is taking risks . Sometimes you 'll screw up-big-time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City publishing company threw a party for a famous radio personality , he was asked to produce a mock magazine cover for the event . But the production house failed to get the job done on time , and Donovan , 28 , had to show up at the party emptyhanded . " My boss was furious , " he said . " I immediately accepted responsibility for the problem : I told him I should n't have sent a job this important to someone I had never worked with before . But the way I handled the whole thing showed that I did not believe that I 'm incompetent . " Neither did his boss . " He saw that I was n't completely shattered , " says Donovan , " which actually made him respect me more . " So the next time you cut a flub , give yourself a break . " Women tend to be very hard on themselves when something goes wrong , " says Nelson . " But there is a lesson from basketball : When you miss the shot , forgive yourself immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep going , you will end up making two mistakes . " Too true . EGO-TRIP TIP 3 Act like you deserve it . Claudia Perez , 29 , an attorney at a small firm in Boston , was twice turned down in her bid to take vacation time . " I told them I really needed time off , so if it was okay with them , I 'd like to take a week . Both times my bosses asked if I 'd mind postponing it until a more convenient time . The first time , I was like , ' Okay , ' but the second time-when I covered the caseloads of several male employees who were allowed to go on vacation-I was angry . " Nelson says that women tend not to question when we 're asked to give more to help out or sacrifice what we need for the cause , whereas men will either balk or agree and then find some circuitous way of doing what they want anyway . " We often just accept our lot , " she says . " We saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't realize that we are doing it too . " Perez griped to a male coworker . " He told me he 'd never been turned down for vacation time , because he 'd never asked . Since he was entitled to the vacation , he 'd just write up a memo . He was just taking what he deserved . " Because of his attitude , no one asked him to change his plans . Perez copped that attitude and has never looked back . " I 'll pitch in and help out , sure . I 'll even do more than my share sometimes . But when it comes to the things I know I deserve , I 'm no longer shy about speaking up . In fact , just last month , a window office opened up . Guess who got it . " EGO-TRIP TIP 4 Do n't ask-tell . Cheryl Hoey , 30 , a consultant in Denver , wishes she had done that after a recent visit to the mechanic . " They told me my car would he ready by noon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' We have n't fixed it yet . ' I did n't even complain . " If Hoey had raised hell , the tardy mechanics might have thought she was a hard ass . Butt who cares ? Women are less likely than men to express anger because they fear being perceived as being bitchy , while men would simply appear assertive , " says Sharon Greenburg , Ph.D. , a Chicago psychologist in private practice . Even if he crosses the line and becomes difficult , a man typically wo n't care as much , because , as psychologist Frank puts it , " Men are more concerned with being seen as strong as opposed to nice , " she says . If the choice is between looking like a shrew or being treated like a doormat , do it the guy way : Err on the side of being tough . When Daphne Steiner hit 30 , the New York City dancer decided that she 'd been bulldozed for the last time . When she found that a jacket she 'd bought had a torn lining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd lost the receipt . " Now once upon a time , I would have been really apologetic like ' I 'm so sorry for being a problem customer , and I know I do n't have the receipt , but if you would be so kind as to exchange this for me I 'd be ever so gratefull . ' But that leaves them room to say no . So I walked in with the attitude that of course they would exchange it and I was not at fault for not having the receipt  --  they were at fault for having shoddy merchandise . " The result ? Cash back for the full price she paid  --  not some rip-off store credit on the even lower sale price . EGO-TRIP TIP 5 Blow your own horn . Photograph Ballsy Barbra : Not afraid to push for perfection . // Modesty is kind of like choIesterol  --  there 's the good kind and the bad kind . And too many of us employ the bad kind  --  the kind with which we trash ourselves . Maria Carton , a 26-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyfriend to proofread a cover letter for her . " He said it was great-if I was trying to convince them not to give me the job , " she said . " It had the tone of Oh , you probably do n't want me , but I 'd just feel so lucky if you 'd hire me . By trying to sound modest , I ended up sounding like a total sap . " The fear of looking like a braggart keeps many women from strutting their stuff . But downplaying your achievements does you a disservice . It convinces others that you 're not as talented as you are , and you eventually start to believe it yourself . Meanwhile , men are valued precisely because they are powerful , so it 's in their best interest to broadcast their power . Women may want power , but they often downplay it so other people to wo n't feel threatened . So Carton sat down and wrote a new letter . " This time I wrote it with the assumption that they would want me . I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed a reply soon . " Surprise , surprise  --  Carton got the job . EGO-TRIP TIP 6 Simply unlearn the meaning of the word no . Sure , no means no when it comes to sex and telemarketers . But in other arenas , no is just the first step to yes . Men know this  --  they 're so used to being dinged by women that they 've learned , for better or worse , that no means smile and try a new approach . Natalie Yusuf , a 32-year-old copywriter , realized this after she asked her boss for a modest , well deserved raise . " He claimed that the budget was already done  --  like he could n't have found me my measly $2,000 . " Natalie ranted to her father about how taken for granted she felt . " My father explained that it 's my boss 's job to say no , and that I should simply expect it the first time I ask . " With that in mind , Natalie went back to her boss . " I was really nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things that only I could do . This time , he gave me the money I wanted , " she said . " What I realized was that this is an adversarial relationship  --  he 's not going to give me more money unless I show him I 'm worth it . " Which she did , smiling all the while . Because surviving in a man 's world has nothing to do with being mean or nasty . To the contrary , it means being charming and cool . After all , you 're taking nothing more than what you deserve .
