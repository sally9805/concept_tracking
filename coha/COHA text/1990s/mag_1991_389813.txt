<p> <p> The remains of President Zachary Taylor are being tested to see if he was poisoned . Next the Democrats will be demanding to know where Reagan was at the time . <p> <p> Harvard 's Kennedy School has announced that Michael Dukakis will give a seminar on " Economic Development . " It is rumored that Clark Clifford has been lined up for one on " The Principles of Laundry Management . " <p> <p> William Cohen , Richard Lugar , and John Warner became the first three Republican senators to break with the GOP consensus on SDI , publicly urging the White House to press for a ground-based system , forgoing the space-based " brilliant pebbles " program , which President Bush supports . The Republicans said the Senate was " highly unlikely " to agree to the " brilliant pebbles " approach , which is probably a correct political judgment ; and since the best should not be the enemy of the good , it is also probably prudent for the Administration to go for what it can get . The defectors introduced an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House to seek Soviet consent to install ground-based defenses . That implies they believe that the Soviets might consent . Does it not follow that they think Moscow more tractable than Congress ? They should know . <p> <p> Are advocates for the homeless really obliged to advocate the way the homeless live ? They expressed outrage when Atlanta Mayor Maynard H. Jackson recently moved to impose criminal penalties for aggressive street begging , sleeping in vacant buildings , and loitering in parking lots . Granting , for the sake of argument , that no level of government can arbitrarily institutionalize people it labels as mentally ill , surely certain behavior  --  abuse of passersby , loud angry monologues , frantic movements , gross disregard for public sanitation  --  merits at least a " move along " from the cop on the beat ? The " homelessness " problem is not primarily a housing shortage- it is a rise in the number of people unwilling or unable to exercise self-control or self-discipline . While charity dictates that we help them , " society " is not to blame for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past thirty years . <p> <p> THE WAY WE LIVE Now : In 1979 , a train car carrying a chemical shipment from a Monsanto Company chemical plant derailed in the town of Spurgeon , Missouri . Nineteen thousand gallons of a chemical used in wool preservatives were spilled . In all those gallons there was the equivalent of a teaspoonful of dioxin , then thought to be the most carcinogenic substance made by man ( environmentalists now consider it much less sinister ) . In 1984 , 65 Spurgeonites took Monsanto to court for their ensuing aches and pains . After three and a half years of trial , and one hundred thousand pages of transcript , a jury gave the plaintiffs $16.25 million . Now , after three and a half more years , an appellate court has voided the award because the jury had not found any actual damage resulting from the spill , but was simply punishing Monsanto for assorted wrongful acts . Even so , Monsanto had a narrow escape : one of the appellate judges wanted to send the case back for a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enough fun . <p> <p> Okay , we 're starting to get tired of the term " politically correct . " Unfortunately , the left-liberal intolerance to which it refers is getting worse , not better . Out in Wisconsin , PC standards , together with the usual smear campaign , are being used against a nominee to the state Board of Regents . The attack against Terry Kohler , a conservative businessman , philanthropist , and 1982 GOP gubernatorial nominee is led by the radical Madison Capital Times ; a recent Capital Times report " proved " his racism and hatred of women by noting that he has given money to the Heritage Foundation , the Rockford Institute , and Paul Weyrich 's Free Congress Research and Education Foundation . Heritage , in case you did n't know once took the same side of a controversy as the KKK ( the article does n't mention analogous ACLU " support " for the KKK ) , while Rockford opposes women in the workplace ( it published an article critical of Senator Kennedy 's child-care bill ) . Kohler 's larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he supports segregation . But this does not qualify as McCarthyism of the Left : Senator McCarthy had higher standards of evidence . <p> <p> The citizens of Leningrad have voted by a landslide  --  55 per cent  --  to chance the city 's name back to St. Petersburg , and Mikhail Gorbachev is rightly nervous . First de-Stanlinization , then de-Leninization . De-Gorbachevization , anyone ? <p> <p> Kuwait 's martial-law courts are not going to win any prizes from Alan Dershowitz . There was the man who got 15 years for wearing a Saddam T-shirt ( though he was also said to have been an informer ) . More recently , six " journalists "  --  they put out an Iraqi propaganda sheet during the occupation  --  were sentenced to death . No one should cavil at ferocious sentences . The invasion of Kuwait was an obscenity , and those who collaborated with it are obscene . The Kuwaitis should realize , however , that procedures that are not in line with Western norms of justice will seem to diminish the justice of their liberation . We say " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been just , even if the Kuwaitis behave recklessly indeed . D-Day was no invalidated when the Rsistance shaved the heads of girls who had slept with German soldiers . <p> <p> The eruption of Mount Pinatubo comes at a particularly sensitive time , as Philippine and U.S. negotiators are preparing for the last round of talks over the future of U.S. bases there , whose lease expires in September . This raises two questions , one military , one political , both critical . Regarding their military value , the most important asset in the Philippines is Subic Bay Naval Base . With its strategic location astride important sea lanes in Southeast Asia , its deep-water port , its natural harbor , and its English-speaking workforce , Subic would be impossible to duplicate in one spot anywhere else  --  even leaving aside the enormous costs of a move . The political question is trickier . The millions in aid we have doled out to the Philippines thus far have shored up a statist system ( the U.S. Government is the Filipinos ' second largest employer , after their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in general set horrible precedents for Washington 's relations with other developing countries . If we are going to continue to have a military presence there , let 's do it because both sides agree on the strategic benefits , and not because we 've bribed the night watchman to look the other way . <p> <p> One of George Bush 's finest moments in public life came in his 1984 debate with Geraldine Ferraro , when he was challenged for his " flip-flop " on abortion . Yes , Mr. Bush replied , he had a change of heart . Since his " pro-choice " candidacy in the 1980 primaries , millions of abortions had occurred , he explained . Could they all have been " hard cases " ? he wondered ; how could one not be moved by such " brutality " ? Mr. Bush has remained faithful to that conviction  --  most recently in a letter to Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell saying simply , " I will veto any legislation that weakens current law or existing regulations . " Meanwhile , Republican pro-abortion nag Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the party 's anti-abortion plank , or else face a loss in popularity . An odd warning , since Mr. Bush has already been on three victorious national tickets committed to that plank . But more important than whatever opposition he may face is the fact that , even as the brutality continues , Mr. Bush can at least face himself . <p> <p> On the free-speech front , the Wisconsin affiliate of the ACLU is demanding that the state remove from all public-school classes a sex-education textbook entitled Sex Respect . Suspicious of the title  --  Hmm , what could those words have to do with one another ?  --  the group 's attorneys investigated and sure enough , turned up a constitutional infraction : the book refers favorably to such notions as abstinence and chastity , and suggest bizarrely that AIDS might have some connection with immoderate homosexual conduct . Thus , concludes the ACLU , it perpetuates stereotypes based on gender and " sexual orientation . " Still more alarming , Sex Respect presents two-parent , heterosexual couples as " the sole model of a healthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible variations . Obviously , the safeguarding of Wisconsin 's civil liberties requires that the book be banned at once and such outrageous ideas never again heard in the classroom . <p> <p> The new Random House Webster 's College Dictionary is emphatically politically correct , flagging words now deemed to be offensive to one or another aggrieved group , and infusing even its definitions with political correctness . That 's the bad news . The good news is that the dictionary seems to be bombing . Without even lifting a wet finger to test the Zeitgeist , Time ridiculed it , and even the New York Times accorded it a chilly reception . The brothers and sisters at Random House may be , as they say in their neighborhood , behind the curve . <p> <p> The annual General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) met in Baltimore to discuss a report on human sexuality which gave its blessing to fornication and homosexuality . It was Old Mortality meets Masters and Johnson . Old Mortality won , by a vote of 534 to 31 , rejecting the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one woman " was " God-given . " The problem with the Presbyterians , and the other mainline Protestant denominations , is that after every such defeat , the libertines remain , to fight the next battle  --  or some battle currently inconceivable ( planet worship ? goddess worship ? ) . What the mainliners have to do is to identify these people for what they are : post-Christians . And to say that if they want a church of their own , well , it 's a free country , but they have no business being in any church founded by John Calvin , or John Wesley  --  or Jesus Christ . <p> <p> Here and there , on Father 's Day , apparently in response to a book by some poet , men gathered to put their arms around each other 's shoulders , " bond , " and announce their manhood as follows : Speaker : " I an Joe , son of John , son of Pete . I am a man . " To which the congregation responds : " Ho . " Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity escape us . <p>
