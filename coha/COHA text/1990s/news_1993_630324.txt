<p> He does n't have a friend in the world , he 's meaner than a junkyard dog , his eyes always search for prey . The aggressive setting of his face , the flared gills and the gaping mouth set with rows of razor-sharp teeth , make him the fiercest predator that swims our lakes and streams . <p> Intrusions in his underwater world of weeds , sand bars and dropoffs are quickly dealt with . He has the ability to wait and watch with little motion except the slow waving of his pectoral fins , and when a fish moves into his area , the strike is a blurred flash , almost imperceptible to the human eye . The evidence remains , a few silver scales sinking in the water , the fish is gone . <p> Welcome to the world of Muskie . <p> I 've fished them on and off for better than 30 years and if I tried to tell you in words why I fish for them , it might not be understood . <p> Anglers have fished them for years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in a frenzy throughout the Midwest . <p> Years ago , the " north woods " of Wisconsin and Minnesota were the favored spots to try for muskie , the flowages and large lakes were the " places to go " for the big ones . <p> It was a long drive to muskie waters from Chicago in those days , but in recent years the Departments of Natural Resources in Illinois and Wisconsin have been stocking lakes with 6-to-10 inch muskie . <p> The proximity to thousands of big city anglers has been a closed secret and I believe it 's because of a mind-set of fishermen that big fish can only be taken " up north " . <p> Today , it 's possible to make one-day trips to very good muskie lakes within 150 miles of Chicago . Sure , you 're going to have your share of " snakes " but also the opportunity to take fish in the 36-to-44 inch class as well . Just a little bit doubtful ? Do n't be . <p> Here are some lakes that offer a chance at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the city in the rolling hills of western Illinois , this man-made lake at Shabbona Lake State Park , has offered good muskie fishing the last three years . <p> Created by a backup of Indian Creek , the lake was filled in 1976 for a total of 319 acres , with excellent weed beds , flat bays and deep structure . <p> Every year , 1,000 to 1,200 muskie in the 11- to 13-inch range are planted by the Department of Conservation and Muskies Inc. , giving the lake 3 1/2 to 4 fish per acre . At this writing , two state muskie records came out of Shabbona : the largest is 24.1 pounds . Best areas to work are the north , east and southwest bays , tops of weeds , the mid-lake weed beds ( drops to 14 feet ) and the " No-Motor " area . Largest released muskie was 46 inches . <p> For information about Jim 's Guns and Gear , call ( 815 ) 824-2415 for daily fishing conditions , bait , tackle and boat and motor rentals . The lake is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 , 2 miles south in Shabbona . Lake has concession stand , public launch ramps handicapped piers for wheelchairs . Campground and picnic areas encircle the lake . <p> Chain O ' Lakes : A 10-year program of stocking fingerlings and 10 to 13-inch muskie has paid off for this popular series of lakes in northeastern Illinois . <p> Introduced to supplement a waning northern population and add a needed predator for stunted yellow bass , the muskie has taken hold in " Chain " waters . Fish up to 46 inches have been taken and many over 30 inches continued to hit crank baits , spoons , buzz baits , chubs and suckers . An impressive amount of newly spawned fish has been seen in the weedy shallows and that will add to the stocking populations . Resurgence of the weed beds on Channel and Catherine Lakes has contributed to a good muskie habitat . <p> Dick Marak guides for muskie on the Chain and noted these numbers of legal fish he has taken . In 1992 , he caught 42 muskies that averaged 36.7 inches , this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The chain has developed into a good muskie fishery and could become a great one in a few more years as the fish mature , " Marak said . " My best method for taking fish is by trolling various muskie baits along outside weed edges and dropping into deeper water as the season progresses . " <p> The best muskie lakes on the chain ? <p> " My favorites are Bluff , Catherine and Channel lakes and they appear to have the best habitat for the muskie , " Marak said . <p> Many panfishermen , working for bluegill and catfish have been surprised by a lightning-fast strike as they were pulling in a small fish . If you doubt the size of the muskie fishery , I suggest that you stop in at Frank and Char 's Resort on Lake Marie and take a look at the pictures on the wall . They are most impressive .

All our fishing was casting in-line spinner baits into the weeds adjacent to the spring holes that dot the shoreline . Best depth was 6 to 10 feet with a medium fast retrieve , keeping the lure just above the tops of the weeds . Some of Richardson 's favorite palces were Rockford Point , Christy 's Bar and the south-end bar that has a sharply defined weed line that drops off into deeper water . <p> This lake is connects with Mendota , forming the Madison Chain of Lakes . Other popular baits for muskie on this lake would include : Grandma , Slammers , Smitty and Suicks and Esox Minnow , with chubs and suckers for live bait on bobber rigs .
