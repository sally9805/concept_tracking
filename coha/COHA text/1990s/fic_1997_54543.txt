I wo n't tell you my name . I do n't know who you are ; maybe you 'd pass my name on , and there are many whom I fear now . I would love it if I had nothing to tell you . I have lost nearly everything  --  country , family , name  --  but I have retained my honor and gained a story , to my detriment , that I 've retold in courts , where I was constantly interrupted and reduced to yes 's and no 's . I 'll give you a more unhalted version than you would have heard in the court . <p> In the spring of 1991 , just before Croatia 's Declaration of Independence , the mayor of our village  --  I 'll initial the village as V. ( for a generic village ) , although it did n't start with a V ( and was n't generic , to me at least )  --  went from house to house to tell us that after Croatia declared its statehood , the Yugoslav People 's Army and Serb Chetniks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region to create a pure Serbian Republic of Krajina . " What guns are you comfortable with ? " the mayor asked . " What did you do in the Yugoslav People 's Army ? " <p> I did n't believe him . I expected him to be locked up by the Yugoslav police any moment . I looked toward the door and was surprised that it was all quiet out there , except for a pair of cats fighting or making love . <p> " Infantry ? Artillery ? " He leaned over me , and I could see the hairs in his nostrils and atop his nose bulb , like sparse grasses on a shiny rock . This man had stolen my two goats that I 'd let roam free in the grassy ditch in front of my house . They 'd disappeared , and a month later I recognized them tied to the lamppost in front of his house . He probably made cheese out of my goats ' milk . He smelled like chevre even now . Anyway , I had gotten over the losses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did spend three months in training , and I can handle a basic rifle . " <p> " Oh , good . Others can handle guns . You 'll be in charge of the radio tower . " Soon I spent nights in the postal relay tower on a hill above the village , typing Morse code , jerky alterations of long and short beeps , and talking on the radio . I developed a network of people to chat within radio communicators from Croatia , Serbia , Bosnia  --  and to trade in plum brandy , CDs , produce , medicinal plants , mushrooms ( I collected them in the woods ) . Sometimes I picked up warnings when Serb jets were about to fly over our area to bomb . Then I 'd call the priest by phone , and he 'd toll the church bells and burn incense as though to hurt the devil 's eyes , and sometimes he 'd burn up so much incense that it smelled as though the village was burning . People hid in the basements , but some did n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns , to demolish the factories and terrorize townspeople so they 'd run away . Once , before dawn , when I was already home , sleeping with my cat , the jets bombed  --  burned down the mayor 's barn , struck the tower foundation . The electricity went out . Next day we brought in new cables , and were back in business , but a hole gaped in the base of the tower so that it looked like an old rotten and branchless oak that had grown a couple of huge mushrooms on top . <p> Everybody was more alert than usual  --  dreading what was to come , suspecting , being suspected , yet energized to work , talk . There was a solidarity among us ; we would defend what was ours . I talked even with the mayor , about the habits of the red fox , what mushrooms you could n't eat while drinking brandy , and so on . I cooked my favorite mushrooms for him and his wife , and when he went out to get blood sausages to go with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made love , standing , next to the stove , and we continued on the sly , in haystacks , at least once a week . There was something erotic about the fear in which we all lived , and an incredible amount of spontaneous screwing went on . I wo n't get into all that , other than to say that I actually enjoyed myself , for a while . I was now twenty-five , felt clever , expanding my horizons beyond my village through the radio-I just did n't know how far these horizons would stretch me . <p> Now across from us over a river valley sat a Serbian village , and on the other side over another valley a Croatian village , and in the distance you could see blue Bosnian mountains , from where Yugoslav troops  --  supposedly neutral but fighting for the Serb side  --  fired projectiles into the Croatian villages . Ours was mixed ethnically and thanks to that rarely bombed . I had never worried about ethnicity , but now we were forced to think in those terms , and I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about two hundred , I 'd say there were eighty Croats , seventy Serbs , some Hungarians , Czechs , and Italians . Before World War II , half the village was German and Italian , but only one German remained . The partisans left this one German because they 'd eaten the bread he 'd baked . The bread was so good that the captain said , " You got to stay here and keep baking that bread of yours for the rest of your life ! " And the old stooping German did just that , with his large cracked hands , cracked from the heat of crusts and yeast . <p> Once Serbs encircled us , I felt strongly that I was a Croat . I was proud of it , felt offended by the aggression and all that . Now , I 'm neither proud nor ashamed of it . The identity is certainly useless to me . I get nothing from it , and I have nothing to give it . If you come from some wonderful country like France or Italy , you gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come from some godforsaken place like Croatia or Slavic Macedonia or Latvia , what do you get ? Nothing , except to be categorized as an alien , a collaborator . Abroad , I 'd be inclined to be ashamed of being a Croat if I did n't see that this system of grading ethnic identities was n't a bunch of chauvinist crap even if under the guise of anti-chauvinism , such as , for example , to say that all Croats , Azeris , Armenians , and so on are hotheaded chauvinists who do n't deserve respect , unlike the wonderfully cosmopolitan and tranquil Swedes and the Dutch . Anyhow , I cleaned my rifle every night to make sure it would fire smoothly at the invading Serbs . Still , although I hated the Serb armies , I did n't hate the Serbs around me . <p> My best childhood friends were all Serbs . I had grown up alone with my grandmother and spent most of my time with my friends ; my father had left for Sweden in the first wave of worker migrations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that he 'd been killed by the Yugoslav secret police , that he 'd married an old billionaire , that he was a drug lord . My mother left for Germany and cleaned office buildings there ; she came home for a month every Christmas , but after she remarried , I saw her only two or three times . Now and then she 'd send my grandmother a check , to cover school supplies for me . Since I grew up without a family , friendships became extra important . <p> Even later , when I went to Germany for a couple of years as a Gastarbeiter , with my Serb friends I hung around and drank my daily beer and played soccer on Sundays . When the war started , we were all back in the village , and sometimes two of them , Jovo and Dragan , visited me in the tower to play cards . They were part of our village army , along with most other male Serbs who were drafted . Only a few  --  those who probably were Serb nationalists or who felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right before the war , and most who stayed with us sat at night at the edge of the village , trying to figure out how we could actually defend our fields and homes . <p> We were not an organized army . It was hard to know who was in charge of us . If we simply banded to defend the village , that made sense , but to be part of the army with an unclear chain of command made me uncomfortable . We called ourselves the Croatian army  --  at the time Croatia was n't recognized and was n't a country but a region of chaos  --  simply because on the other side was the Serbian army . <p> Pretty soon it became clear that the special police controlled us , and it was n't always clear who controlled them  --  whether it was Mr. Marcup , a businessman , or Tudjman 's party ( Croatian Democratic Union ) . Often it seemed nobody controlled them because they had a free hand in many ways , especially with the women . Half the Croats in the police group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke mountain dialects . The other half spoke some kind of nasal English . They came from the States , Canada , Australia , Argentina  --  hard-core types with tattoos ; there was a wild energy about them , like around a band of strays who are suddenly intoxicated with their ability to inspire fear . <p> I found it disturbing that the special police often searched Serb homes  --  even the homes of my friends  --  for guns , and sifted through their papers . Now I know this was a standard intimidation strategy , essential to ethnic cleansing ; Serbian police did the same in the villages under their control . <p> As soon as the police got to the village , they usually came to the radio tower and wanted me to make them coffee . They smoked and looked out from the observation tower with powerful binoculars . I got to know the commander , Goran D. , with a blond crew cut in the manner of the American marines , and his assistant , Igor M. , whom I knew from my high-school days  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particularly brutal defense player , taking pride in his slide-stop . Igor had a lisp since he had no front teeth , probably lost them in soccer . His back teeth were perfectly healthy and white . While he talked , I was distracted by the lolling and bobbing of his tongue . <p> " Hey , what do you think ? " the commander , Goran , asked me once , after we 'd exchanged a couple of jokes and slapped each other on the shoulder . " Are those Serbs of yours trustworthy ? " <p> " Yes , why would n't they be ? " I was no longer laughing . " I 've known them since childhood , they 've never cheated me . We slaughter our pigs together , and together we harvest and dance barefoot every fall on our grapes in the barrels to squeeze the juice out and make wine ; we even cut down the oaks and cook the planks to curve them for these barrels . We are all just peasants , not nations . " <p> " Oh ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant . Why do you say Croats , too , like we 'd take anything from anybody that was n't ours ? " <p> " what I mean is , our fellow Serbs would n't want any army to come here and burn down their houses . " <p> " Any army " he echoed me sardonically . <p> Talking to the policemen , you had to be on edge  --  they drove their points brutally . But mostly they joked obscenely ( in their rounds , they collected jokes ) ; strange , now I ca n't remember anything funny . They offered me brandy  --  and gave me bottles of Jack Daniels to keep , which I did  --  although as a rule they did n't drink themselves . I had a sip now and then , knowing that was n't smart . They even offered me women if I cooperated with them and helped them monitor the local Serbs . <p> But two weeks after our " cooperation , ' started , they shouted at me that I had n't collected any information , that I better shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so on . <p> One late afternoon , as I was harvesting rye in a lush green and orange splendor of late summer fields on the edge of deciduous woods , I heard screams . I went over the hill and saw two men handcuffed to two young oaks . Several members of the special police force were punching Jovo and Dragan , and kicking them with their boots . <p> I laid aside my sickle , and rushed over . <p> " What are you doing ? " I shouted to Goran . <p> " What do you mean , what are we doing ? Is n't it obvious ? Just minding our business . Ask what they are doing . " <p> " What ? " <p> " They want to run over there , join their Serbian brothers . " <p> " How do you know ? " <p> " We know . " <p> " For sure ? " <p> " Somebody overheard them in a tavern . " <p> " So it 's just a rumor . I do n't believe they 'd do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " How come you trust Serbs ? " <p> " These guys are my friends . " <p> " Your friends . Well , they are n't friends of the Croatian people . " <p> I insisted that they be freed , but Goran laughed . " I do n't have the keys to their handcuffs . " " Who has the keys ? " <p> " The guy with the keys is gone to the grocery store . " <p> " At least you can stop beating them ! " <p> " All right , we 'll do that . But let this be clear to you . " He leaned his face into mine and pushed his forefinger into my neck , into the V of my larynx , so that I could n't swallow my saliva . " If they go over to the other side , we 'll be back , and we 'll continue the beating where we left off but this time it 'll be on you . You understand that ? You still vouch for them ? " <p> " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course ' about it ? Make sure the ' course ' does n't get you . You must know about them , have n't you done your homework ? " <p> And the policemen began to walk off toward a jeep . <p> " Hey , who 'll unlock them ? " <p> " What 's wrong ? " lisped Igor . " They look good like this . " <p> And the police drove off . <p> The two friends groaned . Jovan thanked me ; Dragan kept moaning , hanging from his handcuffs . <p> I went home to get a metal saw and brandy to wash their wounds and to soothe their throats , but when I got there , the police were back , and this time they had the keys . <p> Naturally , after the treatment they had suffered , my two friends ran away . I do n't know where they went , but where would they go ? Who knows , maybe they just fled abroad . <p> The police came three days later , and Igor asked me , " So where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was surprised that he now could shape all the consonants while he used to loll his tongue to fake most of them . <p> " How would I know ? " I shrugged . <p> " How would n't you know ? You were so chummy with them , they 'd confide in you , would n't they ? And if they would n't , why did you put your neck on the line ? " He grinned widely . He used to cover up his mouth , embarrassed by his missing teeth , but now he had fine porcelain teeth . Such teeth you could n't get in socialist dentistry before ; this was private enterprise , expensive stuff . <p> " I did n't even know they had disappeared . " I did n't want to appear nervous , but I spoke out of breath anyway . <p> " You guaranteed that they would stay with us . " <p> " No , I said they would n't run over to the Serb side . Anyway , I 'm not their keeper . I could n't lock them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not ? " <p> " Deserters . They did n't stay with us . Where do you expect their loyalties to lie anyhow ? " <p> The cops kept repeating their line , and it would have been a boring conversation if there had n't been a distinct sensation of threat to it . They told me to walk out with them to the back of the building , gave me a glass of wine . " You never know , ' said Igor , " this may be your last . No point in leaving without one . Besides , you might enjoy it better if you 're a bit tipsy . " The commander , Goran , did n't say anything . He used a nail clipper , and in a moment of silence , the clips sounded loud . When he 'd done clipping his fingernails , he took off his boots , sat on a thick root , and clipped his toenails , and then with his fingers cleaned the dirt between his toes . <p> The police thugs formed a circle around me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun barrels , clubs . A blow brought me to the ground . I had a sensation of heat flashing through my brain and down my spine . I passed out , and when I came to my senses , it was getting dark , a blue evening . An old man with a sponge of cold water was washing my head . He told me that I 'd been out for an hour . " Can you walk ? " he asked . <p> No , I could n't walk . The man helped me to his tractor and drove me home . My mouth hurt and bled . I was missing most of my front teeth . My right flank was soaked in hot blood , and I shivered although it was n't cold . <p> " Why are you helping me ? " I asked the man , and recognized him as the old baker . " I hope you did n't ask them to stop beating me ? " <p> " No , just watched from the side . " <p> " Did they see you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you are helping me ? " <p> " They know everything . What do you want ? That I dump you in the field ? " <p> " Might as well . " <p> He drove me to my grandmother 's place and gave me a loaf of soft bread , but I could n't chew it ; it would mix with the blood of my gums . For now I was n't hungry ; I was drinking my own blood with each swallow . My tongue got stuck against my palates , and I could hardly unglue it . <p> My grandmother nursed me for days . She was , as I said , my only relative in the village . So that makes it understandable why I stuck by my friends so stubbornly , though , obviously , it did me no good . Grandmother washed my wounds with brandy and garlic juice and laid slices of onions over them ; she gave me a lot of goat milk to drink . The more time passed , the more I hurt . As soon as I made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . I wondered whether I had internal bleeding . I knew I could n't take any aspirin , because it would increase the bleeding . I could n't breathe in hard ; my side scorched , where the bayonet wound , or a knife wound , was healing without stitches . It needed stitches , and my brain a CAT scan for the concussion . I 'd read you could die from blows to the head even a week after you got them , and I thought maybe I would die soon . How would I go to the hospital now ? If I went into the town , I 'd pass checkpoints . How could I tell them that the Croatian police beat me ? l could lie , but the police probably knew about me . <p> I had fevers ; my wounds were probably infected . But I was at peace . Nothing to be done . I could die , for why live ? Death would be easy in the moments when I was passing out anyhow . <p> My grandmother called up my uncle Ivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town of K. , packed me in the trunk of his Opel , and drove me to Zagreb . During the ride , each stone on the road jolted my brain . <p> On my Yugoslav passport I went to Hungary by train . The border was still controlled by Yugoslav police and the Federal Army . A tired cop asked where I was going . I said , " To the hospital . " <p> " Do n't you have hospitals in Zagreb ? " <p> " I could n't go to one in Zagreb . Their military police beat me . " <p> " Would the hospital people know that ? Anyway , why should I care ? Keep going . " <p> Clearly I could n't be used as a soldier by any army anymore . Who 'd want to keep me ? <p> I tracked down my mother in Mannheim , Germany , and she said she 'd let me stay with her for several months , or , as she put it , " until you get your feet on the ground " ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who kept squeaking at the most ungodly hours . The cage was right above my bed next to the window so the bird could enjoy sunlight  --  and it was sunny about ten minutes a week , from what I could tell . For the cage floor , she used newspapers , mostly the porous kind , like Die Zeit . So at night , crap would melt holes in the paper , and this mush of cellulose , lead , piss , and crap dripped on me . I moved the cage to the other end of the room , but my mother put it right back above me . So I bought the thickest glossy magazine I could find , Der Spiegel , not to read but to fortify the cage . When I opened the cage to place the magazine inside , the colorful shooter flew out . Only now , as the bird kept flying , did I notice that a window was opened , just a crack , but the bird flew right out . My mother was furious , and she wept , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Luckily , I had already made friends with a student of theology in Heidelberg , where I hoped I could study radio communications technology . Hans let me stay with him for several weeks . <p> I applied for asylum status in Bonn . The judge , who listened to half of my story , turned me down and said , " We 've recognized Croatia as an independent country . One of the conditions for the recognition was that human rights be fully respected . The Croatian foreign minister vouches that all refugees will be safe upon return . You as an ethnic Croat have nothing to fear . " <p> " To begin with , ' I said in German , " the local commander of the special police force became a member of the parliament . His assistant , Igor , became the chief of the police in the town that 's the county seat for my village . The only way for me to live in Croatia is to get the papers in that police station that controls my county . How would he react when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out . He probably thought they had left me dead in the field . I know there is a legal system there that looks good on paper , and if I knew people of influence and had enough money , I could sue everybody who beat me , and he knows that . This chief of police would want to eliminate me . " <p> The clean-shaven judge with golden glasses nodded and said that whatever I was saying was psychological and personal , not political . " If everybody sought revenge or the means to prevent revenge , then most of the region , up to twenty million people , could seek asylum , probably in Germany . Would n't that be absurd ? Since you are n't a political enemy of the ruling party-and the ruling party even allowed opposition to participate in elections  --  and you made the point that you were apolitical , belonging to no party , I deem that it would be safe for you to return to Croatia . " He gave me one week to leave Germany for Croatia . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Zagreb and would issue me exit papers that would allow me to travel only to Croatia . <p> Naturally , I did n't go to Croatia . I tried to get asylum papers at the U.S. Embassy in Bonn . When the officer found out that Germany had declined my application , she discouraged me from applying , saying that the Germans were much better informed about the situation in the Balkans than the Americans . <p> Hans wondered how he could help me . He suggested that he could find me a novice position in the Benedictine monastery in Ziegelhausen , just north of Heidelberg . " You 'd love it there ; ' he said . " You could walk on the Philosophenweg in the woods every day , brew beer with them , and I do n't think that they would even need to report you to the state . Anyway , their giving you a shelter would make you immune , I 'm sure . " <p> Monasteries never appealed to me . Besides , I believed in America . When all else fails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula for the last three centuries ? <p> As we talked , l stared at Hans . With his closely-cut black hair , a wide nose , and a big jaw , he resembled me . <p> " Why do n't you lend me your passport ! " Before I was even aware that I 'd formed the thought , I 'd shouted it . " Get a visa at the U.S. Consulate , and lend me your passport ! <p> " What do you mean , lend ? " <p> " I 'll mail it back to you from the States once I get there . " <p> In a week , he gave me his passport with a tourist visa stamp that was valid for one year . <p> In the States , with the help of the passport , I got a driver 's license , and the license is everything , your citizenship , practically , or so it seemed . It did n't bother me that I did n't have a green card . There were many illegal aliens in the country , and now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon it began to bother me that since I had an accent , I had to identify myself , by nationality , when I worked as a porter at a Hilton . If I said I was an American , people raised their eyebrows . <p> " This is a nation of immigrants ; ' I said , " is n't it ? " <p> " Sure , in a way , " they 'd say , " but where do you really come from ? " <p> So I 'd have to say I came from Germany , and sometimes , when Germans cheered up at that thought and switched to German , I had to decline to speak in German  --  they would have read me-and a couple of times I claimed I was a Romanian German , a Volksdeutscher . I found that uncomfortable , especially when a German journalist visited me to make a report on how Volksdeutscher lived in the States . I declined the interview . Lying itself would n't bother me so much , but somehow the sensation that I could never introduce myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean Croatia , but my region and village  --  to be part of me , and never to mention it hurt . <p> I began to introduce myself by my real name and real region . I legally changed my name from the assumed German one to the Croatian one , although that seemed odd : if you have a foreignsounding name , you change it to something like George Johnson , not something even more foreign . On my state tax return-I wanted to become an honest American  --  I filled out the namechange forms . <p> A very simple thing , however , happened . After a year , when the visa on the German passport expired , the INS officials showed up at my address , at my uncle 's . They tracked me down through my employers . <p> The officers , when opened the door , asked , " Are you Hans K ... ? ' <p> I said that I was n't the German , but while I talked to them , for some reason , I had a strong German accent . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the duplicate , and said , " Sure looks like you . " I said that was just a coincidence , which of course it was , but they shackled me . I asked them to release me so I could show them my papers  --  new driver 's license , income forms , and the tax returns , where they read that I had changed my name . I 'd forgotten it was all there . I told them then the whole story  --  they were even touched  --  and when I asked to be allowed to appeal to the courts , they agreed , and let me go free so I could pursue the asylum application , and gave me three months to do so , and they gave me extensions , so a year later the deportation trial took place . <p> There 's one system of justice  --  with jury  --  for the citizens , and another for the asylum seekers , without jury . For the latter , a judge and a lawyer suffice . <p> The judge listened to the INS official demanding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman of Polish origin who had just graduated from the University of Chicago law school and who volunteered to protect me  --  that I be allowed to stay . I trusted my lawyer 's sharp mind . I was attracted to her , but the asylum was more urgent , and I was as timid as a schoolboy around her . She told me that if I married an American , I 'd easily become a legal resident , but uncertain of how to introduce myself , I had n't talked enough to any women to develop a relationship . <p> I was the only witness for myself . The judge asked me many questions which worked more as an interruption to my story than any kind of clarification . Whenever I managed to start explaining what had actually happened , what kind of secret police Croatia had , he 'd ask me something technical and irrelevant , like the name of a river . <p> During the testimony , the judge nodded off while my lawyer questioned me about the threats that awaited me at home ( the Croatian army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way for ruthless police rule in the provinces ) . When it was His Honor 's turn again , he woke up and said , " Now , in your testimony , you said that your grandmother had to leave your village before the Croatian forces attacked , peacefully , and in your written statement in the application for asylum you claimed that your grandmother was kicked and knocked down and forcefully taken out ? Can you explain the discrepancy ? " <p> " Yes , I can . My English was n't good enough when I submitted the application first , and my uncle , who was writing this , misunderstood me , and we never got to correct this . " <p> " Why would the Croatian army drive her , as a Croat , out ? " <p> " It was a blitz attack . They first drove everybody out  --  they had no time to check IDs and all that  --  so they could bomb the hell out of the place without worrying about the civilians . " <p> " Why would n't you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I would , Your Honor , but the village does n't exist . It was razed to the ground from what I have heard . " <p> " What army did that ? " <p> " It 's hard to tell . After I left , Serbs bombed and took the village , and the village changed hands several times . The war activity destroyed it . " <p> " So where would you live if you went back ? " <p> " So I 'd have to live in Zagreb at first , and to my mind , that 's the same thing as living in Chicago  --  I could just as well live in Chicago or Los Angeles . " <p> " Well , why not go to Zagreb ? " <p> " One of the policemen is now a big shot in Zagreb . " I even added that the village mayor would be after me because he 'd found out that I 'd had an affair with his wife . <p> At that , the judge threw up his arms . " There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , to the question of whether you were a habitual fornicator , you answered negatively on the application form . So what can we believe of you ? " <p> " It was n't a habit . And , I have n't had sex in two years . " <p> The judge glossed over my final reason for the asylum application : namely , that since the war in the former Yugoslavia would probably keep going on for a thousand years  --  if you believed the American newspapers , you 'd have to believe that  --  I could not live there with my post-traumatic stress syndrome . <p> He replied : " This country has invested enormous resources to make sure that the peace in the Balkans would take hold , and therefore I see no reason why the country should put even further resources in taking care of refugees who would apparently be safe in their native regions . " <p> The judge asked for the proceeding to be adjourned . When he came back , he asked me : " If your application is denied here , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply for an asylum ? " <p> My lawyer asked for clarification : " To apply to stay here or in that country ? " <p> I thought for several minutes  --  I was dazed . What , will they deport me ? Are there cops around ? I looked over my shoulder . Cops , no matter what nationality , terrified me . <p> The judge asked again , and my lawyer urged me to answer . <p> " Australia " I said . I knew nothing of Australia , except that it was something like Texas stuck in the middle of the ocean . <p> The judge then read the verdict , off the top of his head , from what I could tell  --  something like this : <p> " Since the claimant was not wounded severely enough to seek hospitalization , there is no ground to suspect that his life would be threatened in Croatia . If the group of men from the police force had wanted to kill him , they could have done so in the war . Now in peace , the likelihood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to my estimate . <p> " The claimant has one month to leave this country voluntarily for Croatia at his expense or to Australia if the Australian government agrees to accept him . If he does n't leave in thirty days , he will be deported to Australia within ninety days or to some other country that agrees to accept him , and if none does , he will be deported to Croatia . I will give him five years before he may reapply for asylum in this country . " <p> And that was that . My scars , my passing out , my bayonet wound , the teeth knocked out , that did n't qualify as a credible threat and something that should have gotten medical attention . <p> I know that many people who had never been threatened or were threatened much less than I had been  --  Croats from Serbia and Serbs from Croatia  --  got the asylum . <p> I marveled that the judge , who probably lived in wealthy suburbs  --  played golf and retold stories from the court to entertain people at cocktail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was n't in the Balkans . Anything that deviated from the formula  --  divisions along the ethnic lines  --  did n't work for him and for the German judges . <p> So what do I do ? Go retell my story in Australia ? Why would it work there ? They 'd say the Germans and the Americans know better , and if they think you 'd be safe , why should we think otherwise ? Could I end up like that man without papers who lives in a Parisian airport ? No country , no papers , only a story about no country and no papers .

That they left it up to me to come back to be deported  --  that almost convinces me that I would indeed like to stay here . <p> I am not saying that I 'm not going to Australia or Finland ( Finland , Endland ? ) . If I leave the States , I want at least my story , such as it is , to stay . l think many Americans might want to know that there 's no jury for foreigners , asylum applicants , here . And they should have the opportunity to know that the Balkan problems ca n't be reduced to a chemical formula of adrenal hatred among different ethnic groups . Am I asking to give a geography lesson ? Should I include a map here , or somewhere , of my old land ? Better not . For me , that land is disappearing into unreliable memories , and I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOVAKOVICH <p>
