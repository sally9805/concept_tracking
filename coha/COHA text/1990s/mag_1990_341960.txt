Behind the steel curtain of Iraqi tanks and guns , occupied Kuwait is losing its national life . The uniformed invaders who declared the tiny country a province of Iraq are systematically destroying what remains of its identity , pillaging its economy and brutalizing its people . Everything of value , from furniture to computers to uprooted traffic lights , is being shipped to Iraq . <P> In the process , Saddam Hussein is remaking Kuwait 's demography to suit himself . Thousands of fleeing Kuwaitis have been allowed across the border into Saudi Arabia and replaced by an influx of Iraqi civilians . Government records are being carted off or burned ; soon it will be hard to prove who is or is not a Kuwaiti . <P> At the Khafji crossing point on the Saudi-Kuwait border last week , air- conditioned Mercedes-Benz and other late-model sedans lined up by the hundreds . Their passengers told stories of beatings , looting and nights full of gunfire . While there is still food in the shops , they said , rationing had begun , and Iraqis had first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , explosions and summary executions of suspected resistance fighters . <P> As the " Iraqization " of Kuwait becomes bloodier , it raises a serious question for the U.S. and its allies : Even if the international effort succeeds in forcing Saddam out , what will remain of Kuwait ? Meanwhile , full- scale finger pointing has begun in Washington on a related question  --  whether the Bush Administration did enough to prevent the invasion of Kuwait in the first place . <P> By July 28 , five days before Iraqi tanks rolled into Kuwait , U.S. reconnaissance satellites had spotted the logistical preparations for an offensive . The CIA and Pentagon quickly changed their estimates of an attack from possible to highly likely . The White House and State Department , however , clung to the view that Saddam was only trying to frighten Kuwait into territorial concessions and refused to accept that intelligence judgment . <P> On Capitol Hill last week , Lee Hamilton , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East , reminded Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly that he had defended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 , two days before the invasion . Kelly had also said the U.S. was not bound by a defense treaty with any gulf state . " You left the impression , " said Hamilton , " that it was the policy of the U.S. not to come to the aid of Kuwait . " <P> At the State Department there were suspicions that the Administration 's preferred scapegoat might be Ambassador April Glaspie , who left Baghdad for Washington the day before the invasion . At a meeting with Saddam on July 25 she told the Iraqi President that George Bush " personally wants to expand and deepen the relationship with Iraq . " She assured him that " we do n't have much to say about Arab-Arab differences , like your border differences with Kuwait . All we hope is that you solve those matters quickly . " <P> Some in Washington have argued that Glaspie 's enunciation of U.S. policy might have seemed a nod and a wink in the Middle East style , giving a green light to Iraqi action . But Saddam indicated that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The nature of American society , " he told her , " makes it impossible for the U.S. to bear tens of thousands of casualties in one battle .
