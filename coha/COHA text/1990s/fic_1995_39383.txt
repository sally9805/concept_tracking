I 've never understood about fishing and buffalo stomachs . I admit it freely . I am no cannibal . But there are connections between me and the world . I 'm not a cog . I 'm a bolt . People who know me find me reasonable  --  neither gluttonous nor profligate . It is only my wife who thinks I devour without permission and eschew what I should eat . <p> Only yesterday , for example , just back from vacation , I was driving across the city , the water glittering in the lake on one side of me , skyscraping apartment buildings  --  clean steel Mies  --  glittering on the other side , Bach 's " Air on the G String " on the radio . I soared . The road was newly paved and the high places were long , the dips so smooth and quick the nose of my little car never turned down , just fell for a second vertically and rose again , me with it . Two bids pumped upward in the distance and then a perfectly proportioned curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to see an airplane , barely moving , opposite the birds but on the same slant , heading down for the airport I had just left . The plane disappeared behind a building ; and when I saw it again , a trick of the sun , I guess , had it sinking straight down now , no slant , falling lazily like a parachute , like me and my little car when the beautiful road dipped . I knew my place . <p> Even the shells are bleached white here on my seashore . The Gulf of Mexico is so light a gray that the sun above it can blur it nearly to white . Directly across the same Gulf , on the edge of Florida where we went one spring on vacation because he likes color and baseball , the water is altogether different : blue . There are lots of palm trees and sea oats among clumps of long-bladed humid green grass , sea grapes with flat round red leaves , mossy pine trees and a sky hectic with birds , such birds : blue herons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalks and shockingly yellow beaks , greedy mud-colored pelicans flap-elbowing each other off the crowded fishing piers . The sun is red and sweet , unreal . The shells are striped and glossy . I found one that looked like the hide of a green zebra with one perfect straight orange line up the middle , as if painted on with a fine Japanese brush . <p> So after we went to Florida that one spring because he wanted to , after I 'd spent the whole week comparing where we were to where I 'd rather be  --  the shore of my childhood summers , the resort of my adult dreams  --  he said he 'd see this beach of beaches . " Let 's go to Texas . We 'll take a few days off at the end of August . I want to see this place . " He said it on the plane going home from Florida . Immediately I blanched innerly , like one of my Texas shells , like a brittle white sand dollar with a secret rattling in its closed chambers . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ) , and I said to myself that sensing danger would help me to avoid it . I knew he would n't like Port Aransas . I knew to him it would seem primitive and brutal . I knew to me it would seem primitive and brutal now , except it was inside me in the way places are inside creatures like creatures are inside places , like mountains are inside mountain goats , like mollusks are inside shells . I knew he was not my brother or my father , or even my cousin ( he was my husband ) , and I knew that would be a problem . Blood bonds to places , and everything there is is layered and surrounded . <p> I thought I was ready . He would be my guest . But I did not foresee the argument about murdering fish . How could anyone foresee such a thing ? <p> We flew into Corpus Christi and drove the short distance to the tip of Padre Island in a rented Buick . Already this was wrong . When I was a child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coolers atop the car and drove down from Central Texas , where we lived . We crossed from the mainland on the car ferry , so the water snuck right up under us , car and all , first thing . Every year we took the same vacation , my uncle 's family too ; all eleven of us stayed in one cabin . One pair of grown-ups slept in the bedroom and the other pair in the sitting room , which was the same as the kitchen . Until my little sister and my youngest cousin grew up a little , they slept in the sitting room too , on a pallet made of beach towels on the sandy floor . The older kids got to sleep on the screened porch , on salt-smelling mattresses that felt as if they were stuffed with ancient oyster shells . We tossed and twitched on our crunchy beds gingerly , because of our sunburns . We giggled softly late into the night , and listened to the roar of trucks on the main island road a hundred yards away , and sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we imagined we heard the Gulf waves whispering among the tall wheels . <p> Every morning we packed the two cars full of food and Coca-Cola and beer , and drove to the beach about a mile away . Sometimes the cars were so full of stuff we older kids were allowed to ride sitting on the doors , our legs inside and the test of us out . You drive  --  still do  --  your car right up to the water , and then you could sit on top of it , stare at the Gulf and pretend to be a pirate or a renowned fishperson scouting schools . The ca glinted in the sun and heated up like a roasting pan with you on it . We made sand animals . We buried each other : we 'd dig a deep hole and put somebody in it , then smooth a mound of sand around his shoulders till it was a perfect dune with a head on it , and finally the buried kid 's muscles went crampy , and he 'd burst from the white earth like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time in the steamy salt water , to boil for a while instead of roast . The grown-ups fished in the surf . <p> We recognized the end of the day by how red our skin was , not by the color or position of the sun , which stayed high and strong till dusk , when it changed momentarily from white to yellow and popped suddenly into the water while no one was watching . When we were red enough we packed the cars and drove back to our cabin . My mother and aunt cleaned vegetables ; my father and uncle cleaned fish . It was the children 's job to take the laundry to the laundromat without dragging the towels through the sticker burrs in the pale lawn , and to fetch eggs or fruit or pickle relish from the Island Food Store which smelled of hot wood and bread . One afternoon we . resolved to help with supper by trapping crabs . It took us hours to catch a dozen from the pier , none bigger than my youngest cousin 's tiny fist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got them back to the cabin they were dead in our dry creel . My father and uncle came home from fishing and found the bodies where we dumped them in the grass burs by the back door . They made us boil them and ( though my mother fought them on this-she said they 'd already started to smell off ) eat them . There was no mote than a teaspoonful of meat in each crab . We scraped smidgens from crevices in the enameled labyrinths of inner shell , sucked the juice from spider legs , and then my uncle re-boiled the shards and strained the liquid for broth . My father thought it was necessary to eat what you kill . " It 's not magic , " I heard him say forcefully to someone later in the house , while I lay with the other children on the screened porch thinking of sleep . " It 's common consideration . It 's keeping things right between us and the fish . " <p> The condo my husband had booked for us this time had a view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the modern kitchen with its butcher-block island , I remembered how my mother and aunt laughed as they moved between the sink and the little table in out kitchen-sitting room , working with shoulders touching . I told him about that , and when he looked at me as if there must be more to the story , I added : " My mother did n't laugh when she cooked supper at home . " <p> Immediately I went hunting the thermostat , turned off the air-conditioning and began tugging at the window over the carport . " Do n't you think we 'll be hot without air-conditioning ? " he asked . " It must be a hundred and ten out there . " <p> " This is urgent . There 's got to be a crowbar here somewhere , " I said . " I need a window open . I need a window open now . " The windows were all painted shut . I pulled barbecue tools out of kitchen drawers until I found a hammer and a sturdy spatula . On my way back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattened out , pulled tight by the ears , so I smiled affectionately . " We 're lucky to have the Gulf so close , you know . " I did n't want him to be afraid . <p> I went to work furiously on the window . From well behind me , he peered toward outside . " There are cars right up on the beach , " he called out , plainly astonished . " Would you look at that ? People are driving their cars right up to the water ! " Wood cracked , the sash zinged , and the window rolled open . I stepped back , sweating . Dead white paint chips littered the sill . <p> " I know . That 's what you do here . " <p> " Do n't kids get run over ? " <p> " Every once in a while . Not very often , I do n't think . " <p> We spent four days going to the beach . The wind was high the whole week . He sat on a towel decorated with the Coca-Cola logo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat Conroy novel and a bottle of SPF 30 sunscreen . He squinted at me through eyelashes studded with sand . He did n't wear sunglasses because he did n't want to tan like a raccoon . " Why are there so few birds here ? " he asked . " No pelicans or herons like in Florida . " <p> " There are gulls , " I said , pointing to a homely line of them gazing with us at the water and staggering in the hot wind . <p> " Maybe for the same reason there are so few people , " he answered himself . It was a Friday morning , and only a pickup and a sun-silvered Camaro were beached near us , pulled up to the high tide mark in line with the gulls . <p> I made peanut-butter sandwiches with jalapeno peppers on flour tortillas every noon , and carried mine down from the condo to eat them sitting in the breakers . Bits of tar swirled in the water around me When one hit me it stuck like a leech . Sand blew into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth after I swallowed . He usually stayed in the kitchen to eat his lunch , and then took a nap . He never wanted to go back to the beach after that because he 'd already cleaned himself up once . It took quite a while to scrub , with mayonnaise , the tar from our skin . He wondered if it would eve come off his new trunks . <p> Evenings , we walked on the fishing pier to see what people were catching . We dodged flying hooks cast inexpertly by children off the windy rock jetty a mile or so down from the pier . " Sometimes you can catch crabs around here , " I informed him . <p> Tuesday night we brought some shrimp back from Aransas Pass . I told him we might find a good restaurant over there on the mainland , but what I really wanted to do was ride the ferry . So we did , and we saw one restaurant that looked all right to him  --  a steak house built with stones on the bottom , logs on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimney . We got as far as the crowded parking lot ( it was the crowd that soothed and attracted him ) , and he stopped the rental car halfway nosed into a space . He left his hands on the wheel and turned to me . His eyes moved from my feet up to my neck . " You know , " he began , still not looking at my face . " I do n't want to embarrass you . " <p> I ca n't say I was n't surprised . The betrayal was too soon and too overt " Yes ? " was all I said . <p> " Well , it just occurred to me  --  I just noticed what you 're wearing . " <p> " I never knew you to pay much attention to my clothes . " <p> I had on a polyester muumuu I had bought at the Island Food Store and rubber flip-flop thong sandals . <p> " I never saw you looking like this before . You do n't wear this outfit at home , do you ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we ought to go in this place . These people look pretty dressed up . " There was a group of women getting out of a ca near ours . They had on high heels and carried patent-leather purses . <p> " Okay , forget it then . " I did n't care about eating at a crowded steak house with a tepee on top anyway . I wanted to get back on the ferry . " Let 's go back . " <p> A couple of miles before the ferry landing , we stopped at an open-backed van by the side of the road and bought some shrimp in a plastic bag . " We 'll take them home and boil them , " I said . " You wo n't believe how fresh they 'll taste . " The fat woman who sold us the shrimp had three fat children playing in the front seat of the van , no front teeth and flip-flops the same color as mine . <p> On the ferry I got out of the car , as usual , to feel the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little strip of water from the mainland . I considered the shrimp . I was fascinated by them , and had taken the plastic bag out with me to the ferry 's front rail . They were dead , of course , but still perfect : their feelers and legs unbroken , black eyebeads , pale pink stripes . Their last meals were still visible through their fragile shells in their alimentary veins . <p> " I 'd like to eat them with their skins still on , " I said to him after we 'd boiled them . " Eyes and all . " They were pinker , done being cooked but each one still intact . They drained in a colander . Two of them embraced a limp half-lemon , their legs twined about it on either side . They were like mythological figures balancing a symbolic orb over an antique door . Steam rose from the colander : the absolute last of their pale pink spirits . <p> I relented and did not eat the eyes and shells ; but I refused to let him de-vein my portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tried not to chew too many times , as if they were holy things , and so I could imagine them coming to life and swimming in my gut , eating what I ate , pink parasites in a gracious host . <p> It got hotter and hotter . We lay in bed one night at the end of the week listening to the hungry gulls calling for help . Pools of sweat rose in the hollows between my breasts and ribs when I lay on my back . I felt him sighing beside me , awake . <p> After a time , he got up . He flopped once , disentangled his long feet from the top sheet and popped out of the bed . He fumbled through a drawer and found his blousy seersucker trousers . He hopped on one leg around the room , fighting for his balance as he put them on . " I 'm going for a walk , but I do n't have much hope of cooling off . Even the goddamn wind is hot . " <p> Now I sighed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snakes as you 're crossing the dunes . They come out onto the paths at night . " <p> He changed his mind , refolded his trousers carefully into the drawer and returned to the sticky bed . Finally , I felt the springs soften and I could tell he was asleep . As I drifted off myself I remembered , too late , that we could have turned on the air conditioner . <p> When there was only one more day left , I decided we should go out on one of the party boats to fish . I had thought of it a few other times , earlier , but we had n't gotten to it . I do n't think he much cared what we did , and I had been happy floating in the waves , baking in the sand and eating peanut-butter and jalapeno sandwiches . Now , I thought , it was time to go fishing . <p> And what caused the trouble was not the fishing , nor even my putting it off until it was so late . It was my real self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole trip , and which burst out , wide awake , well grown and ready to kick ass the minute I stepped onto that boat . <p> Every married person has a real self , I guess ( as well as people who live with their mothers and with roommates ) , which over the years of being only in common places is slowly bludgeoned unconscious by a gathering of small blows with very blunt instruments : dishrags , bedsheets , dandelion roots , now and then a snow shovel . The real self hides like a small fish in a grotto , coils to save itself like a snake in the dunes and sleeps . Around it , cell by cell , grows another more pliant personage to live in the common places : it knows how to avoid unpleasantness , Mexican food , excessive sun , ecstasy . Still the real self wakes sometimes at night to moon-bask on the cool dune paths and to star in dreams of rebellion and courage , or to fish in the Gulf for its darkly swimming buried kin . <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I remember from when my father and uncle used to take me and the other kids out on these big boats designed for groups of inexperienced fishermen . One side of the boat is designated for being seasick and the other for fishing . I have never been among the seasick . In fact , the happiest I have ever been , I think , is when standing with my hips fitted snug into the point of the bow riding up a swell and crashing down , shrieking , salt water soaking me , stinging my sunburn . I did it this day too , now adult and undignified , having ignored the warnings of the old sailor who captained the boat . Still I shriek and sing ; again I am the happiest I can be . <p> As soon as we stopped , the men around us made a shiny pop-top reef around the boat and let out their lines . I baited my double hook with a ribbon fish and wiped my hands on my orange terry-cloth shorts , which I had bought years ago for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his birthday . I had kept them in a box and had finally decided to wear them myself . <p> " These guys are drinking beer ? " he said . " Jesus , it 's 8:30 in the morning . " He looked queasy . He had n't enjoyed the ride out . " But it is hot . " <p> The steel deck rail was becoming uncomfortable to the touch . He leaned over the side , then came back upright but swaying . " This water looks like it 's about to boil . I think I 'll buy a soda . You want something ? " <p> " Beer . " He headed for the cabin . I fished . " Maybe you should get yourself some crackers to settle your stomach , " I called after him . <p> He was wrong : this water was not about to boil . It was still , bubbleless , foamless , as secret as frozen soil in winter . We had left the clattering gulls behind with the shore . I saw one lone shrimper at the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past us and home somewhere . I trusted the leathery old sailor who had brought us here . Indeed , he even had an electronic fish-finder up on the bridge , if the sign by the dock was true . There were fish below us . But I firmly felt , staring at my slack line , they were asleep at the faraway mud-misted bottom of the Gulf , as soundly asleep as jonquil bulbs in Yankee January . <p> It was a half-day trip . We were supposed to be ashore again by noon . By eleven , the captain had moved us twice and all that had been caught was one dark-fleshed jack ( my father called them liverfish ) , two puny kingfish off the stern , and a large pitted gray rock by someone 's grandson who had been fishing near me and who , in the process of reeling in his rock , managed to tangle my line hopelessly with his . For a rushing moment , I 'd thought we 'd awakened the fish and we both had bites ; but instead , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers unthreading our lines from it . Many people lost bait . Something down there was nibbling in its dreams . <p> As I re-baited my hook we moved again . In the new place I lowered my line with a benediction ; in answer , ten minutes later , ten minutes before we would have turned for shore , there was a flicker of fish fifteen yards from the bow where I stood . It gamboled near the surface , twisting like a puppy , its energy mixing and shining with the sun . " There 's my fish , " I whispered . <p> " That 's no kingfish ! It 's a tarpon , " yelled the captain from above me on the bridge . <p> My line tinged taut . With the calm of the prescient , I raised my pole to set the hook , and in an instant that hook was on its way to Florida . " Let her run awhile , " the captain told me . He was right behind me now . " Reel in , " he ordered everybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , big one . Never expected a tarpon today . Do n't see them all that much . " He sounded as if he doubted whether I deserved such a fish . <p> " Now you start inching her in , " he advised me . My arms ached already just from holding onto the pole while the fish ran . When the fish rested I braced the end of the pole against my stomach and turned and turned the reel . When it jerked and swam sideways the captain pushed me along with it . Up and down either side of the boat I sashayed and sidestepped to fool the fish into thinking it was pulling me ; then , when the captain gave the word , I pulled it . My arms went numb early on . " You want me to take over ? " he asked . <p> I shook my head . " My fish , " I gasped . The dearth of breath in my lungs gave this the sound of a question . <p> It was a fish fight from one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish or two as a kid , dragged it myself off a boat like this to the scale by the fish-cleaning house , hugging it on the way like a dead child . We used to catch small sharks and kingfish , jack , once a big tuna I did n't like the taste of . They fought , but not like this fish , my fish . <p> Suddenly the line went slack . I thought my fish was lost . But it was only breathing under the boat , trying to trick me . I waited . <p> The numbness spread to my legs . By the time the fish started running again I had braced myself against the railing in a V shape , the grip of the pole poking my midsection out into a point , my heels on the deck and my toes smashed up against the side of the boat , my arms stretched to the utmost to keep from losing the tackle . I reeled and waited , holding tight . Finally , I could feel where the fish was : less deep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface water . I reeled some more , and unbraced my legs enough to lean and peep over at the water . My fish flashed at me a silver greeting from an eighth of a mile underwater . <p> " I saw it , " I sighed . <p> " Damn straight , " the captain whispered in my ear . " You want this fish ? " I nodded and shrugged to catch some sweat from my chin . " Then reel . " I felt blisters rising on my hands with each heartbeat . I knew how the fish felt . I too had surrendered in warm salt water , unable to swim for the lapping of waves in my mouth . I knew how the hook hurt as it pulled , how it jabbed as I gnawed it ; so when my fish began its last run and the pole slipped in my chafed and sweaty hands , I considered going with it over the side , letting my fish catch me . <p> I re-gripped . And when the fish was done running I reeled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother for the last push in a birthing , and up came the fish with a splash like a gunshot . It flipped , looping the line round its tail in the air . It was miraculously silver-blue-and-green , the same colors as the winking hot gulf . Blood covered its face . The captain and I were both soaked by its explosion out of the water . He climbed to a perch on the deck tail , ready with his gaffing hook , and kept coaching : " Up . Keep the tip up ! " <p> The fish out of water was too heavy for me . I let it drop back down . It was gone again . But I sat on the end of my pole as if it were a seesaw and pried it up again . The bones in my crotch ached , but the fish was caught . The captain and one of his teenaged assistants gaffed it through its middle and levered it onto the boat . <p> " That is a nice fish , " the teenager dryly opined . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . Decked , it flopped and faded from blue-green to gray . Its gills pulsed hugely and irregularly . I could not see its eye for the blood from around the hook . I could hardly breathe . Some of us on deck hopped and slid around to avoid the thrashing fishtail . The grandson who had caught the rock climbed with me onto the railing and stared enviously at me as I watched my fish . The teenaged assistant reversed his gaffer and slammed the fish in the head a few times with the handle . Soon after that it stopped caroming about the deck . It lifted itself twice from the slimy pinkened boards , its middle rising first , then up-ended the curve in the air and thudded down . Finally it died with its gill chamber wide open . Each filament was discrete : you could have counted them , hung like harpstrings . If you were small enough and careful you could have walked among them in the spaces where the breath had been , like a Chinese weave in an ancient silk factory with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taxidermist in Fulton , " the captain said to me . His teenager had started the boat and was turning us around . Someone had dragged my fish to the cooler astern , where it lay ignominiously among mackerel . For a moment I did n't understand the word . <p> " Taxidermist . Oh , I do n't want a trophy , " I said . " I 'm going to eat it . " <p> " Oh no ma'am , " advised the captain , politely laughing . " Most people around here do n't like to eat tarpon . " The men around me tittered . <p> " Why not ? " <p> " It 's no eatin ' fish . My way of thinking , fish like this , you mount it . " <p> He searched for another way to explain , forcefully : " It ai n't good eatin ' . " <p> " You expect me to hang it on the wall ? " <p> " Hell yes . That is one good-looking fish . Skull 's in pretty good shape . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trophies . They did n't know anything about eating tarpon . They were just siding with the old sailor . " Here , we 'll see what your old man thinks about it . " He had come up behind me , and saluted with his beer can . It was close enough to lunch for him to have one now , and I guess he had gotten used to feeling on the border of sick . He still looked yellow . <p> " Did you see ? " I asked him . <p> " Of course I saw . I was right here the whole time . Look how wet I am . " He jiggled his knees so I could hear his shorts sloshing . " That is a big fish . You should be proud . " <p> " I am proud . I caught it . I 'm going to eat it . " <p> " I think we should have it mounted . " <p> " This fish is too important to stuff , " I said . The captain wheeled and waved a hand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were useless . I hated to lose his approval , but my real self was now in control . He headed for the ladder to the bridge . <p> My husband reasoned : " It 's because the fish is so important that I think it should be mounted . We 'll find someone in Corpus Christi and have them send it to us when it 's done . We 'll leave early tomorrow for the plane and drop it off . " <p> " No . " <p> " Well , we do n't have time to eat it , even if we wanted to . We 're going home tomorrow . " He was becoming annoyed . I could see the tightness in his throat as the words passed through . " You should have gone fishing earlier in the week , okay ? " <p> " I do n't care . I 'll find some dry ice and take it on the plane in coolers . I 'll have it cleaned and cut up . " <p> " They wo n't let you on an airplane with dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy who had caught a rock . <p> " How many coolers do you think we 'll need for a forty-pound fish ? Or more ? " he yelled , waving his arms and spilling his beer . <p> " I 'll give some away . " <p> " Nobody wants to eat this kind of fish . You heard him . He says it 's not good . " <p> " It is good . I 'll figure it all out . " <p> I had to eat what I caught . Or , at least , what I caught had to be eaten . If there were someone to help me eat it , I could share . I did n't have to eat it all myself , but it could n't be wasted . I had been taught this as a child . It was part of my family 's science . My father 's people claimed kinship with the Plains Indians , a tenuous connection , which my mother maintained was no more than fancy dress for an ancestor 's sexual indiscretion ; still my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making spoons from horns , clothing from skins and toys from bladders  --  wasting nothing . It was important that if you killed something you kept its life going by taking the whole of the dead into yourself . I do n't know that he ever said it to me just that way , but I know it to be true . <p> I 've never seen anyone act so crazy and be so convinced she 's right . If I pulled the car over by this curb and stopped a hundred people at random and told them the whole story , I bet they 'd all side with me . She said her father made her eat dead crabs . She said I had no soul . She said there was nothing real left of me . She said she was descended from Native Americans who used all of the buffalo She made no sense . <p> I came home on the flight we had tickets for . Christ , I had to be back at work  --  and she stayed so she could find enough dry ice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't let her on any plane . Maybe she 'll have to eat the whole thing there , frying it up in chunks on a hot plate in that lousy beach house . Maybe she 'll stay down there forever eating tarpons . She 's gone completely nuts . She 'll swallow the eyes and crunch up the tail , eat the liver and turn into a fish . Is n't that what the Indians did ? I tried to calm her , smooth her down . She was bristly . " Let 's not make this into life and death , " I said . <p> " What the hell else do you think it is ? " she screamed back at me , spitting . The back seat of the rental car was piled high with slimy , bloody plastic bags containing bits of fish . She 'd wrestled the thing by herself down the dock and had it chopped up at a fish house . She was covered with blood and the car smelled awful . ( Oh , my own little car calms me , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fits so well around me . ) " My fish is bleeding , bleaching into me . It is exactly just life and death , " she raved . <p> " You 're scaring me , " I said . Her left forearm was clean of fish blood . I touched the salty skin there . I remember we passed one of those big spiraling plastic slides that dump kids into pools of water and I thought how the kids on that one , shadeless in this wild place , must be getting their butts burnt off , and I remember thinking I was glad we were going home . At first she wheedled me . Her voice was low and monotonous , humming . She suggested we take the fish back to that hot little condo and stay another week ( a week or so is what she said  --  " or so " : how long ? ) . We 'd jam the refrigerator full of fish and start eating . " We 'll eat the fish together . You 'll help me eat it . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with slippery fish , the butcher-block island twinkling with scales . I saw barrels of tartar sauce , mountains of lemons , fried filets , ceviche , tarpon chowder in a washtub , minced-fish-and-onion cakes the size of basketballs . I saw the little Weber grill smoking up the carport full-time for a week " or so , " scarring slabs of fish with charcoal stripes , and I saw her sweating and grinning through the smoke . I glimpsed the edge of lunacy myself . I thought of fish fritters for breakfast , and my stomach quivered . " I do n't really care that much for fish , you know . " <p> That was all I said , and then she cut loose and sang her anger at me . She chanted like a TV evangelist or a witch doctor in a Tarzan movie . He face was bright orange and shining  --  sunburnt I guess , but it occurred to me that she 'd caught fire from sitting in this deadly sun all week and was about to combust spontaneously , right there on the bloody car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were starting to melt like the plastic on the baking water slide . To touch her now would burn me . Her hair was mashed flat on the top of her head from this ugly fishing cap she 'd been wearing , and it jutted out in stiff salty tufts around her ears . <p> She said I had no connections with things . She went on and on about the sea and the fish and the plains and the buffalo and life and death and her childhood . She said even the Christian culture knows how to redeem violence : through sacrament . She would take communion , eat her fish . If she did n't , nothing made sense .
