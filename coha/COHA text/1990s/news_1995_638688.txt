<p> Killing near North High a stain on a fine school <p> I am a student at North High School , and I was in class the day that Clint Martinez was shot and killed . It really discourages me that the news media can beat this very unfortunate story to a pulp . <p> Every story that I have either read or heard on television about this has made it look to the public that this all happened on North High School 's grounds . The reality is that it did n't , and that now my school is taking yet another bad story and literally being hit in the face with it . <p> In recent years , North High School has really been trying to bring itself out of the shadows of a bad reputation by trying to get kids back in school and trying to promote positive things , such as getting involved in the school . <p> For instance , our sports clubs have been doing extremely well this year , and in the past two years , North has had two students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last semester North had 219 students with a G.P.A. of 3.0 or better . North was finally beginning to show that it is a good school , and that any child could have a second chance . <p> When Clint Martinez was shot , every good thing that has happened at North was forgotten . The shooting did not happen at North , yet the media is punishing North like it did . It seems so sad to me that the news media could make the school look so bad when all it is trying to do is get better . I feel very sorry for everyone that was involved with this tragedy , but the way it was handled by the media brought a good school down , and we do n't deserve it . <p> THERESA M. SCOTT , <p> North High School student <p> Denver <p> Closing the campuses at North and West High schools should only be the beginning . Every high school campus in the metropolitan area should be closed . <p> Through open campuses we create an atmosphere where impressionable kids are allowed to roam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the kids congregating in Washington Park across from South High School . Many of these kids never return to classes after lunch hour . The administration at South High , as at other metro high schools , has created a situation where underage kids willfully break the law by smoking during their off-campus escapades . <p> Contrary to modern-day psycho-babble , most high school students need structure while they learn intelligent decision-making processes . <p> If closing all campuses keeps one kid in class , one kid out of jail , one kid alive , then it 's the right thing to do . <p> DAN TRUJILLO <p> Denver <p> Readers voice support for Million Man March , <p> take issue with views espoused by Farrakhan <p> After listening to Rep. Pat Schroeder whine that the " Million Man March " was " sexist " and " ageist " because women and children were discouraged from attendance , I was surprised and disappointed that our consistent , fair , and objective representative accepted induction into the Women 's Hall of Fame . <p> One can only guess as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As a long-time campaigner for families ( abortion without parental notification , midnight basketball , condoms to schoolchildren ) it seems odd that Rep. Schroeder disapproves of men 's efforts to remind themselves of their responsibilities to their families and communities ( The March , Promise Keepers ) . <p> Should this continue , I may be forced to conclude that Rep. Schroeder is neither consistent , fair , objective , or family oriented . As a liberal 's liberal she now has something in common with men : learning to share power for the good of us all . <p> JON RHODES <p> Denver <p> Would someone please tell me what I did ? <p> Louis Farrakhan is really mad at me , and I do n't know why . And believe me , the way they 're talking , I do n't want Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam mad at me . <p> " A lot of whites are having heart attacks because their world is coming to an end . " My world ? What did I do ? <p> I 'm a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sixties , and missed most of the revolutions and movements . <p> No doubt I benefited from them , but during most of the marching , burning , chanting and singing , I was feeding the chickens , mucking the barn , and riding my bike . I remember where I was when Kennedy was shot . I was in kindergarten , and my teacher cried . <p> Now I live in a nice house in the suburbs . I have a nice white bread sort of life , lots of children , loyal dogs , a home improvement project a month . <p> That kind of a life . <p> My husband and I met in high school and both of us worked our way through college , sometimes working as many as three part-time jobs at a time . We both feel as though we earned our way to where we are , and I ca n't ever recall having stepped on the backs of any man or woman , on my way up the ladder . <p> I am a teacher . I 've seen some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong sense of social responsibility . My husband and I both support lots of worthy causes , not only financially , but with our time and talent . <p> I have n't worked at a decent paying job in my entire working career . <p> Why is Louis Farrakhan so mad at me ? If people are going to take charge of their communities and make them better places , I 'm thrilled . I do n't think that I or any of my contemporaries view that as a tremendous threat to our way of life . <p> So I hope Mr. Farrakhan stops being mad at me . <p> I learned something a long time ago that I 'd like to share with Mr. Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam . <p> People will almost always rise to the level of our expectations of them . Or sink . Think positive . Play nice . <p> SUE SCHAFER <p> Parker <p> My 11-year-old Jewish son asked me today , " Why do so many black people hate me without knowing me ? " I explained that all blacks do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did so many black people join a club whose leader tells them to hate Jews ? " <p> I could n't come up with an answer . Maybe someone from the black community might want to give it a shot . <p> STEVE FELD <p> Englewood <p> I was deeply moved watching news coverage of the Million Man March . I would like to congratulate the members of the black community who participated . <p> I would also like to take this opportunity to remind the white community how important a strong family is . There is a serious breakdown of our families . I find this very distressing , but I do n't think it 's too late to do something about it . We need to love and support all our families in the United States and the world . <p> ALICIA CONNOLLY <p> Aurora <p> Proud liberal decries <p> decaying national mood <p> " Millions do n't count for much , " plutocrat Ted Turner is reported as saying , and because of inflation , " Money becomes worthless . " <p> Yes - in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world where money incestuously breeds money from money , to no effect except as numbers on financial reports . <p> Is there nothing more important than the financial bottom line that benefits the few at the expense of the many , the already wealthy at the expense of the rest of us ? Have we come to the place where we measure all things by their monetary rewards , regardless of human relationships and dignity ? <p> Are honesty , integrity and consideration for others - on the national as well as individual scale - so out of date that we no longer can or even should demand them of our representatives and ourselves ? <p> I am - proudly - a liberal . I want to see all our people liberated from ignorance , disease , poverty , crime , exploitation . I want to see our beautiful , irreplaceable land liberated from being destroyed forever by those greedy for immediate monetary gain . I want to see our members of Congress liberated from self-serving contributors to election campaign war chests . <p> Those currently in power are sowing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman and therefore unlikely to live long enough to see the whirlwind that those in power will inevitably reap if they continue on the course that they are currently taking . <p> MARY McDERMOTT SHIDELER <p> Boulder <p> Jeffco commissioners <p> come late to airport fight <p> Your article " Delay of airport faulted " ( Oct. 17 ) outraged me . All of a sudden Commissioners Gary Laura and Betty Miller are concerned about the public . Do not be fooled by the apparent concern for their constituents ' well-being . <p> Where were they when we were begging for help to stop the Jeffco Airport Expansion ? Unconcerned , indifferent and deaf to our voices . <p> If Commissioners Miller and Laura want good public relations and trust - why not try representing the voters who elected them ? <p> JAYNE HARTMAN <p> Westminster
