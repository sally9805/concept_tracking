THE WAITER SET THE DEAN 'S PLATE DOWN with an unnecessary flourish , and Suzie Abrams , then and there , fell in love with the steak . It was a gorgeous piece of meat , Argentina-shaped , hatched with grill marks , glimmering with the promise of spiced blood . Suzie 's fork hovered in the windowlight . <p> They were dining at Le Petit Mort , the town 's only French restaurant , she and the dean and the final candidate for history professor , a blond Frenchman named Antoine Pouissant , or Anton ; he went by both names and , with Gallic equanimity , refused to clarify . <p> Suzie 's plate arrived , layered with radicchio , baby spinach , endive-the sort of lettuces , she imagined , fed to sable rabbits . Pouissant sniffed at his veal medallions . The dean set to his meal with a great and alarming gusto , as if it were his intention to eat the plate as well . Pouissant trickled a comment down his long nose , and the dean barked with laughter . Suzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up and up and up . She corraled her drool . <p> As always , the dean had been impervious in his ordering : " A piece of meat , man . Cook it , stick it in the middle of the plate , and keep those julienne vegetables far afield . " It would be his decision whether the department took on this Frenchman or the candidate who had visited last month , a mousy philologist who appeared on the verge of tears her entire visit . Suzie 's presence at this luncheon was ceremonial , perhaps even ornamental . She was the Associate Dean ( Humanities Division ) , and her opinion was to be solicited , then quietly disregarded , as these matters inevitably went . <p> " Is n't that right , Suzie , eh ? " the dean asked . <p> Suzie smiled . <p> She could not say how or why she had become a vegetarian . When required , she cited the expected political and health considerations . In this capacity her husband , Saul  --  a gastrologist who knew , a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved useful . And yet these answers felt somehow inadequate . Her motives had more to do with an aversion to flesh , specifically flesh in her mouth , the careless savagery exuded by carnivores . <p> Suzie had felt not a little betrayed when , on their last vacation ( a week in Wyoming ) , Saul ordered wild game at every meal . Caribou sausages for breakfast . Buffalo steaks for dinner . An antelope-chop sandwich . " It 's fresh , " he told her , with a sheepish shrug . " When in Rome . " <p> " But really , Solly : moose tartare ? " <p> " They ship the moose in from Ottawa . I 'd never order that . " Suzie loved her husband , of course . He was a good man , excruciatingly so , with a soft voice and a patient manner . Not once had he complained about Suzie 's work schedule , her moods , her frequent flights to academic conferences . He seemed incapable of complaint , allergic to conflict . So well did he relate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get along better without her . <p> Pouissant tittered at something the dean said . He was a sharp one , this Frenchman , as shrewd and incoherent in the promotion of his ideas as the dean himself . At his presentation , a day earlier , he had fielded questions with such aplomb that the words themselves , tapered on his nimble tongue , seemed to drift up and dissolve into an elegant mist . He spoke of Martin Lucer and morganatic marriage and consanguinity . " I do n't suggest that Lucer was attempting to break away from the Church , " he told his small , tweedy audience . " I merely suggest that he was attempting to break away from the Church . " <p> The dean tore into his steak , and juice flowed from the spot he had pinned with his fork . The knife glided through the meat , showing pink . <p> Pouissant was attractive , you would have to say that , with a tan that set off his eyebrows like blond velvet . He wore no wedding ring , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . They were so lambent she considered stabbing one of them with her fork . Instead , she touched her hair . <p> " I 'm afraid that is Ms. Abrams 's area of expertise , " Pouissant said . <p> " She 's one for deconstruction , is n't she ? " The dean held his second bite in the air for a moment , and Suzie smelled the smoke trapped inside the meat , the pepper and red wine that must have played some role in the preparation . <p> " What 's the point of building thoughts if you ca n't tear them down again ? " she said . This was one of her standard lines . Academia , with its cloister , fed them to her like dried fruit . Her fork remained aloft , suspended by a thread of longing she could do nothing to snap . Pouissant caught sight of this , and Suzie managed to poke at her plate . But she had followed so dearly the course of the dean 's steak from his blood-puddled plate that she felt herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent of flavor , or , rather , tasting mildly of dirt and dill . The ( lean proceeded with his third bite , offering her a full cross section  --  rare ? medium rare ?  --  and his top lip glistened . Suzie spooned dressing onto her salad and called for another glass of wine . <p> With epic reluctance , the dean ceased his attack . " Your veal OK , Antoine ? " <p> " Serviceable . Yes . But tender ? " Pouissant tapped his plate disapprovingly . <p> In college , Suzie had taken a summer job at an Argentine restaurant , where one of her duties had been to prep steaks . Her supervisor was the proprietor 's son , a tall , haughty boy who moved about the kitchen with a strand of rope bundled , inexplicably , in his fist . One night he approached her from behind and , without a word , circled his hands around her waist , grabbed the wooden utensil with which she had been tenderizing , and began pounding the steaks . They were alone for only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breasts , but as she watched the muscles of his forearms tense and smelled the sweated cologne that rose from his body , her hips buckled and she fell against him and could feel him , hard , then harder , his checkered pants shuddering against the curve of her behind . <p> Though her father had urged her to take the job  --  part of his advised regimen of worldly exposure  --  she quit a week later . For months , she felt off balance . In group therapy , she found herself referring to the incident as a rape . She formed an intense and ineradicable prejudice against Latin men , dyed her hair red , and switched her major from Anthropology to English , gravitating toward nineteenth-century literature anti , finally , the more obscure novels of W. Somerset Maugham . <p> In Maugham 's world , love divided itself along a dependable fault line . On the side of the civilized lay the dull kindness of stew-scented hearths . Beyond this resided an unchecked carnal fanaticism . Maugham was especially fraught by female sexuality , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The heroines of his lesser works played like succubal waifs : Mary Panton , a rich young widow whose fling claims two lives ; Kitty Fane , a panting hedonist whose adultery triggers her husband 's death ; and of course Liza of Lambeth , lovely Liza , the slum trollop who drops her knickers once too often and perishes after a botched abortion . <p> Suzie cackled out loud over Maugham 's musty misogyny and worked without regard to the hour , whacking at a manual typewriter so rigorously that her neighbors banged on the walls . She found herself returning to certain especially piquant passages , such as the culmination of Catalina : " Beatriz was breathless with lust for the male . She was like one possessed . There was something not quite human about her , something even slightly horrible , but so powerful that it was terrifying . It was sex , nothing but sex , violent and irresistible , sex in its awful nakedness . " Tucked away in her unheated den , a bare bulb dangling over her desk , Suzie would contemplate these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him until he agreed-through his tremulous stutter  --  to take it all back . She was never certain whether it was these fantasies , scholarly passion , or the frigidity of her flat that caused her lips to tremble . <p> The steak had stopped steaming , and that was something . But so , too , the dean had slowed . The plate-sparking pace of his initial attack was now interspersed with tendentious declarations on the state of higher education , most concerned with the desirability of an enforced student dress-code . <p> Suzie gazed at the juice leaking from the edges of the steak  --  an oily chartreuse  --  and took stock of her ardor and decided that she was not , in fact , in love with the steak . One could n't fall in love with a piece of meat , after all . Especially a sirloin . No , what she was in love with was the idea of the steak . Her conception of the steak , perhaps as an oralaggressive totem , or as a sublimation of vampiric impulses . Mead had discussed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was willing to grant the steak this , its representative import , preserving for herself the role of determinant . Once inside her mouth , reified as charred flesh , the steak would , she felt confident , hold no more allure than the salad that now clogged her mouth , jagged and fibrous . She pried her gaze from the dean 's plate and was dismayed to find Pouissant staring at her chest . <p> " Nor is it a matter of enforced conformity , " the dean said , " as some of my younger colleagues have seen fit to suppose . We only hope to instill in our students a sense of dignity . You can not run a university in which the chief mode of discourse is the public display of undergarments . " <p> On any number of occasions since joining the faculty fifteen years ago , Suzie had been given pause to consider the similarities between the dean and her father . Both were Chicagoans , slight men with oversized heads , belligerent jaws , and a nagging susceptibility to dandruff of the eyebrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island college , her father pecked away at the theories of great thinkers , publishing a series of breathtakingly unreadable tracts from the rubble of his study , on Lakeshore Boulevard . The two men had never met , but they drove with the exact same disregard for lanes , lights , or any other traffic signals . Her father was also a prodigious carnivore , and it had been the absence of meat in her home that led , finally , to the cessation of his visits . <p> The dean 's steak , rising thickly against the white plate , pinched at both ends , now resembled a pair of women 's underwear . Suzie wondered , briefly , how meat underwear might sell ; whether its semiotic significance might be touted as a selling point . She felt well beyond contributing to the conversation and , when finally queried by the dean , made vague allusion to feminine troubles . The dean looked away , reddened . Pouissant 's tongue darted to one corner of his mouth , then the other . " You have shildren ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names and ages , as well as her standard spiel on the desirability of raising kids in a town such as hers . All this was true enough  --  why , honestly , might she lie ?  --  but her thoughts drifted to a consideration of her middle daughter , Dana . <p> Unlike her eldest and youngest , both husbanded and settled into suitable occupations ( book design and social work ) , Dana went at the world with a sexual bravado Suzie found distressing . In high school , even before , Dana would sneak out of her room and invite boys into the basement under the cover of night . More than once , Suzie had been forced to listen to sounds a mother should not have to , her own daughter writhing in some dramatic pleasure , while Saul slept , soggy-mouthed and curled around his pillow . She did not like to imagine , though she often did , what went on when she attended conferences . <p> She had questioned Dana only once about her romantic entanglements , asking what became of the nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I just fooled around with him , " her daughter murmured . " It 's not like we were in love . " At last report , Dana was involved with a ski instructor named Trent , who had brought her home from Colorado in an aqua outfit that framed her jutting breasts . <p> What was Suzie to do ? She had spoken to all her girls about sensible control of one 's own body . She would have liked to have been firmer with Dana . But such a course would be inconsistent with her ideas , social and political . Nor did she intend to inflict on her daughters the chastity her father had enforced . ( He spent most of her adolescence prowling the front porch , bellowing at one or another of her gentlemen callers . Her response had been obvious : she sought out the sexiest of the Italian boys , thick-armed thugs whose hands smelled like cigarettes and dug roughly at her breasts . ) <p> Naturally , Dana ate meat . This proved a great source of pride to her grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision both to constitutional necessity and to her diet during summer visits to Chicago . While the other girls complained of his roasts and liver , Dana returned home plump and full of blood . <p> In darker moments , lying awake on weekend nights , Suzie could not help viewing her middle daughter as one of Maugham 's molls , Liza of Lambeth perhaps , red-lipped , white-shouldered , overripe . Or the Spanish firecracker Beatriz , " breathless with lust for the male . " <p> Suzie 's devotion to Maugham puzzled her family . Why did she spend so many hours poring over the drab prose of a man she loathed ? Was it the appearance of purity soaked in eventual debasement ? The opportunity to trumpet the corset as transcendental signifier ? The critical irony ? Or , as her father insisted , the veiled titillation ? " Still got your knickers in a bundle over that Victorian porno ? " he had barked , some years back , sending Suzie into a paroxysm . <p> Her father was remarried now , to a rouged , haunchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this woman on the behind ( as he used to Suzie herself ) and called her honeybun and sweetmeat , making no secret of his reinvigorated libido . Absurdly , he wanted the girls to call her " Grandma . " Suzie caught a gust of the dean 's breath  --  seared garlic and mesquite , disturbingly alluring  --  and this roused her . The dean was winding things up . " So , then , your wife could be happy here , you think ? She would not find us too provincial , Anton ? " <p> Pouissant offered one of his feline grins . Suzie set her fork on her plate and awaited dismissal , absently wondering if she might pick up something at the gourmet butcher on the way home . <p> During their courtship , with Saul in the throes of residency , she had prepared huge meals on his nights off , lingering over menus , dressing expensive meats in wild mushrooms and cream sauces , waiting sometimes hours for his return , then tackling him to the floor of her candlelit walkup and riding him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she came to the act with such ferocity ? Years ? A decade ? <p> " You must excuse me , " the dean mumbled . " The bladder grows no younger . " He moved from the table with the same careless gait as her father , nearly toppling a busboy . With a glance , Suzie noted the remains on his plate , a fat-rimmed Tierra del Fuego , wet and available . <p> It was n't just all that other business . It was this , too : she had forgotten the beauty of meat , how , as a girl , she stood before the butcher 's glass and stared at the thick cliffs of red , laid like offerings on ice , how her father 's arms had looped around her waist ; his hot words in praise of cuts and chops . <p> The sirloin was there . And there , a foot away , was Pouissant . He cocked his head and regarded her . She looked from him to the steak . The waiter swished by and dipped , as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth first , sank in like a harpoon . She drew the morsel toward her mouth , then paused and set the fork down before Pouissant . <p> " Life 's great tragedy is not that we perish , but that we cease to love . Do you know who said that , Anton ? " <p> The Frenchman , pleasingly unnerved , shook his head . <p> Suzie wrenched her right foot free of its high-heel shoe and slid her stockinged toes forward , meeting his thin calf . Soon the meat would touch her tongue , and her jaws would move once more with native assurance , incisors gleaming . Juice would flood the gullies between her tongue and gums . Her foot traced Pouissant 's inseam . She watched his sophisticated grin dissolve , listened as a soft moan escaped him . <p> Suzie felt violent and irresistible , terrifying and powerful , and from her throat came a sound , as Maugham would have it , not quite human . " Feed me , " she told Pouissant , finding with her foot the center of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Steven Almond <p>
