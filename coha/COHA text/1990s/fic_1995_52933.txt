i . On a January Monday , I stared at the twenty-two-year-old disaster in the mirror . A lump behind my ear was painful to the touch . It was eight-thirty in the morning and I was n't dressed . " Hey , " said a voice only I could hear . " The choir boy from hell . " <p> As a kid , I called my secret double my Shadow . We had an on and off relationship . That morning he wore the very same neo-Edwardian suit and wide tie I 'd worn on Friday night when I told him to get lost for good . <p> " The rent is two months overdue and you 're already late for work , " he said . " You do n't have the nerve for a life in advertising or crime . So , it 's up to me to save our asses . " As I watched , he gulped mouthwash , ran his hands through his hair , and wiped a trace of methadrine off his nose . We still did n't need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like someone who had slept in his clothes . <p> Usually he stayed so far inside me that I was n't even aware of him . Sometimes he spoke like a whisper my ear . On tense occasions he would appear right beside me . Occasionally other people had seen that and asked if we were twins . But never before had he tried to take my place . <p> As I moved to block his way , he pulled on my overcoat and asked , " No word from the draft board ? " The reminder stopped me dead . My Selective Service classification had been 1-A since I left school the year before . This worried even my Shadow . <p> Years later a wise man called him my Silent Partner , said he was my addiction . But even before that I knew who he was . We both did . " I am all your bad habits , " my Shadow said as he walked out the door , " And you are mine . Get some rest . " <p> He had seen to it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though there had been a coup , I was relieved to crawl back into my dark cave of a bedroom . To lull myself , I invoked a memory of a laughing baby held up against the sky . It was a kind of magic charm as I rolled between sleep and waking , catching glimpses of the world through my Shadow 's eyes . <p> Miraculously , he got onto the subway with a New York Times in his hand . Had he paid ? I watched him scan the pages . My stuff appeared in the daily papers . <p> He found something I 'd had a hand in writing . It wound like haiku past elongated drawings of an ultra mod young couple : <p> FASHION KICKS AS 1966 WELCOMES ' 67 AT DARLINGTON 'S . . . BUT YOU KNEW THAT <p> By dark magic and luck , my Shadow got up to Herald Square before nine . Fresh-faced , bleary-eyed employees flowed out of the subway into Macy 's , into Gimbels . He cut his way west against the tide from Penn Station , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a truck . <p> As he must have seen me do , my Shadow turned and passed under a sign : <p> ON THE CORNER OF SEVENTH AVENUE AND THE WORLD DARLINGTON 'S . . . BUT YOU KNEW THAT <p> Inside the employees ' entrance , a guy yelled , " Watch it , Bub ! " Technicolor stripes enveloped my Shadow . Black and red , blue and white , purple and gold , a psychedelic zebra herd . In a lyric flight tempered by a strict character count I had written about these very miniskirts : <p> ABOVE THE KNEE ! BEYOND FASHION LAW ! <p> Dodging moving racks , my Shadow stepped onto an elevator . A trio of sales ladies practiced looking right through him as they got off on three . Assistant men 's suit buyers walked off on six talking basketball . Ten was Advertising and Promotion . My Shadow arrived there at the stroke of nine and I could not have managed that . <p> In New York it was winter but on Ten it was spring . Easter promotion artwork was stacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sized cardboard flowers , colored eggs that must have been laid by Rocs were everywhere . But no people ; the place was deserted , eerie . <p> In the copywriters ' office , the phone on my desk rang . As my Shadow moved to answer it , a meeting broke up in the conference room . Then it occurred to me that this was the day of the Spring Fashion Presentation , a big deal with all the buyers attending . Everyone in advertising was supposed to have shown up at eight-thirty in the morning with a bunch of punchy promotional ideas . I had missed the meeting had in fact no punchy ideas . I was doomed . <p> The phone rang again and my Shadow slipped off my overcoat , grabbed the receiver and said aloud , " Darlington 's . Fashion Copy . Kevin Grierson . " <p> " Copy ! " a man yelled . " I 'll give you copy . " It was Wiggy Glickman , the Misses ' and Juniors ' blouse buyer , a middle-aged fanatic . " LODEN ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened and everybody , copywriters , artists , stylists , began filing out . Some stared with curiosity and not a little malice . <p> " In the Daily News yesterday , " Wiggy screamed , " ' Lovely flared sleeved elegance in Pearl , Turquoise , Ocean , Ebony , AND LODEN . ' That was you left that in the copy ? " <p> It had been me . " Not really , " said my Shadow very calmly . <p> " SHMUCK ! I told you Loden is something guys wear when they 're out in the woods . Ladies wear jade . JADE ! " <p> Les Steibler , the art director , elegant , balding , all smiles and show biz , came out of the meeting , caught sight of what he took to be me and rolled his eyes in dismay . " Good old Les here will help us , " my Shadow murmured and looked like a lost waif . <p> Glancing back to make sure that Jackie Maye , our boss , was n't watching , Les gave brisk orders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clothes for Baby Face Nelson here . We know his sizes all too well . Tell Barbara we need a complete makeover . Connie , make sure the studio is n't in use . Go , Kevin . " <p> Turning , taking the phone , he said brightly , " Les here ! " Then , " Wigs , such language ! What , I missed something on the news ? Loden riots ? " <p> Connie was the production assistant , the lowliest of the low . For a few months the year before that had been my job . Tiny , cute , she led my Shadow to the studio at the other end of the floor . In the shooting area stood a dozen naked mannequins , pink and faceless , arms akimbo . " Luv Dolls , " my Shadow whispered and laughed when he felt me cringe at a certain memory . <p> Makeovers were a specialty of Advertising and Promotion . I had availed myself of them more than once . My Shadow knew the routine . The changing room had a shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Jackie Maye was furious that you were n't at the meeting , " said Connie . She was after my job . " Jackie told me to work up an Accessories presentation . But Les made excuses , said he was sure you 'd come across with great copy ideas . " <p> " Yeah , I was up till four last night working on them , " said the Shadow as Connie handed him a towel and retreated . <p> " Disaster ! I have n't got anything to show , " I whined . " I 'm going to be fired . " <p> As he undressed , my Shadow pulled a small package out of a jacket pocket , snorted some crystal methadrine and put it away again . Amused , he turned on the water . " Poor little Kevin went all to pieces at a party . Remember ? " <p> ii . Suddenly , I did . That Friday night , I had wound up in a loft on a deserted street near Madison Square . The decor was black and white . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garment District and Max 's Kansas City , the world of fashion and the Warhol Factory , linked . <p> " They rounded up the usual crew of perverts , " a thin guy in a flashy suit remarked . He seemed to be someone I knew . With no idea of what he was talking about , but aware that he was the source of the speed , I smiled . <p> " Mr. Accessory Before the Fact , that 's me , " the man in the flashy suit had said . " Yeah ! Guilty as charged . " He too was ripped . Something about his nose and eyes gave him the look of a falcon . All that was certain in my world was that I had been drinking and snorting since lunch . Speed swam underneath the thin ice of gin . " Let 's go see the Luv Dolls , Kev . " <p> Somewhere downstairs , at another party or an annex of the same one , Mr. Accessory Before the Fact spoke to a guy on a landing , slipped him bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauzily lighted room . <p> Inside , a john in a suit knelt on a mattress . Looking over his shoulder , I saw slim legs , firm breasts , a fan of long black hair , a kid with eyes so blown that light seemed to shine through to the back of her head . I was wired enough to be turned on . <p> Then her gaze , empty as a mannequin 's , transfixed me . At rare points in my intoxication came a moment I called The Eye of the Storm . Not sobriety , but a remote , godlike calm . The john and the room got as distant as the view through the wrong end of binoculars . <p> At such moments I was omniscient . I knew the girl 's whole story : sixteen , new in town from Ohio and getting passed around , the young lady was told about a party , then found she was the party . Waking up tomorrow was not going to be nice . <p> Mr. Accessory asked , " Is this the one for you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene revolted me . All I wanted was to escape . Turning , I found my Shadow standing beside me smiling , blocking my escape . <p> Mr. Accessory did a goggle-eyed double take . " Do you have a twin brother , Kevin ? " he asked my Shadow . <p> Before my icy , remote state of mind faded I said , " Stay away from me . For good . " <p> " See you around , Fred , " my Shadow called as I headed down the stairs . <p> iii Monday morning at Darlington 's , fashion stylists and junior artists popped into the fitting room bright as elves . My Shadow emerged from the shower wrapped in a towel and asked teasingly , " Could I get some privacy ? " <p> " NO ! " They clustered around , fascinated by this usurper as they never seemed to be by me . " How are you feeling Kev ? <p> Les appeared carrying a folder . " Are you feeling Kevin ? " He moved his hand in front of my Shadow 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socks , Kevin . Nobody wearing second day socks can look another person in the eye . " <p> As he slipped into the clothes , people handed my Shadow talc and Binaca , deodorant and Alka-Seltzer . " Powder them buns ! " <p> " Drops to take the red out of the eyes . " <p> " But nothing on earth will get rid of the glaze . " <p> " I want to see him in this striped Carnaby Street shirt . " <p> " I want to see him just in black shoes and bow tie ! " <p> " For minimal cash up front I 'm sure that can be arranged , " Les said . " Okay . Everyone back to work . " <p> When the two of them were alone , he handed my Shadow a folder . " This artwork I did for your presentation ? You left it on your desk over the weekend , did n't you ? We were supposed to get together Saturday , remember ? " He sounded mad . " I must have called you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mother ? " my Shadow wondered . But once again he gave the lost waif look . At home , I squirmed at the cheap ploy . Worse , it did n't even work . <p> " Get your coat . " Les turned and walked away . " There 's an outdoor shoot . It was arranged that you go as my assistant instead of Connie . To keep you out of Jackie Maye 's sight . " <p> I was in despair . But my Shadow shot his cuffs and murmured , " See the trouble I have to get you out of . " <p> When he went to my desk for the overcoat , Connie was working on an Accessories layout . " Kevin , " she said . " Message from Sarah . Lunch at twelve-thirty at Schlep 's . " <p> My fellow junior copywriters were amused . Sure that I was going to fall flat on my face , each of them was also doubtless working on Accessories presentations . " Does Les know about Sarah ? " asked one . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menage for every taste . " <p> " At Darlington 's . . . " <p> " But you knew that ! " they chorused . Suddenly , everyone was very busy . My Shadow turned and faced Jackie Maye directly for the first time . <p> Almost six feet tall , a kind of goddess , Jackie had modeled for Dior back before the war . She used an ivory cigarette holder and wore a hat in the office as if at any moment she might have to fly off to a fashion show . Twenty years before , she had coined the slogan , " Darlington 's . . . but you knew that . " Les had told me the whole story , how it became a tag line , something Milton Berle would say when a second banana asked where he got his dresses and picture hats . <p> Jackie 's off-center smile could enchant and it was on full force for the pair of Italian designers who were with her . It faded slightly when she saw my Shadow . With the absolute courage that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture of handing her the folder with Les 's sketches as if it was his presentation . <p> My heart jumped . There was n't a word of copy in there . But , just as he had gambled , Jackie Maye walked past him remarking , " Meshuggener ! " For the benefit of her guests , she translated that from the Yiddish as " Eccentric creative staff . " <p> My Shadow told me , " You got to keep them guessing . " Les awaited him , wearing a handsome topcoat and an unusually serious expression . " This , " murmured my Shadow , " is going to be painful . " Instead of taking an elevator , Les walked downstairs to the selling floors . <p> Nine was Linens : cloud banks of sheets , blue fields of bath mats , the scent of cedar chests . My Shadow gave a bored sigh as they went to the escalator . " We do this to see which of our ads are selling merchandise , " Les explained , still trying to teach me the business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picasso of the Paris knock-off/ ' my Shadow murmured to me . " He 's been here so long , he really cares about this crap . " <p> They floated down through the post-Christmas aroma of stale candy canes in Children 's and Toys , the leather and after-shave of Men 's Wear , a melange of fragrances from sachet to Chanel from the Tailored Lady Shoppe , the Bridal Boutique , Lingerie , Misses , and Juniors . " I know you do n't make much now , Kevin . No one does at first . But you can in a few years . " <p> " Yuch , " said my Shadow . " Homilies from wise Auntie Les . " <p> That soon after the holidays , shoppers were few and fetal . Sales people called back and forth to each other as they arranged their shelves , an occasional bell bonged to summon a buyer , porter or security . <p> As they made the majestic thirty foot descent to the main floor Les said , " Saturday night I spotted you on Third Avenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far gone to notice me . I tell you this because I care about you . I 'm a hardened New Yorker , but what I saw really disturbed me . " <p> My Shadow hung his head in what might have been shame . " The cheap voyeur , " he whispered . " What was he doing in that neighborhood ? " <p> Their way out of Darlington 's lay past slender gold pillars hung with jewelry , past tables on which marched serried ranks of single high heels . Les said , " You need some kind of help , Kevin . " <p> With the bright insincerity that ends all conversation , my Shadow said , " I think you 're right . " <p> Les shrugged and said , " Well , I tried , " and was silent on the short cab hop over to Sixth Avenue and Twenty-Seventh Street . <p> Wiggy Glickman , the Junior 's and Misses ' Blouse Buyer , was already waiting at the curb . The moment he saw Les he set up a wail . " PLEATS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all with pleated fronts . The treatment today has got to be flowing feminine , flattering . " <p> " Ten in the morning and you 're worried about pleats ? " <p> " The artwork I 've seen is like men 's dress shirts worn by the Beatles . Like your friend here , " he gestured at my Shadow . " A nice boy , I 'm sure . " <p> My Shadow said quite clearly , " Tell the old pervert to buzz off . " <p> " What are you on ? " Les asked quietly . " Just so I can avoid it . " Then aloud , " Wigs ! Such poetry ! Flowing , feminine flattery ! Plus sets of knockers that 'll give you a heart attack . " <p> My Shadow muttered , " Where does Les get off being self-righteous ? He 's peddling his ass hard right now . " <p> We were in the heart of the Flower District , blocks lined with wholesale florists . One of them had contracted to set up potted trees and hothouse blossoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't frigid . But it was January and they were shooting spring fashions . Truck drivers honked and whistled at girls in goosebumps and blouses pinned up to emphasize the flowing , feminine pleats . <p> Even the plants shivered . To emphasize the vernal theme a lamb had been hired . Between shots its handler wrapped the animal in a wool blanket . A young lady with the face of an angel was supposed to hold it on a leash . She sneezed and exclaimed , " Gawd damn that sheep ! " <p> " Kevin ! Kleenex ! " Les yelled . <p> " This is a prize-winning Exmore lamb , " the handler snapped . <p> My Shadow was kept busy which made him sullen . In a free moment he went into the store 's rest room and snorted some more speed . When he got back , they were breaking for lunch . The florist was yelling because the lamb had eaten a fern . " Whose idea was the Extra More sheep ? " Wigs wanted to know . <p> " Kevin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't rely on his protection anymore . <p> That 's when my Shadow remembered his date with Sarah . He was flat broke . " Can I borrow two dollars ? " he asked Les . <p> Handing it over without even looking his way , Les said , " Your usual fee , right ? " <p> My Shadow crossed Broadway against the lights in the midst of a fast-moving convoy of racks laden with women 's coats . I told him , " You 're wrecking my life . " <p> " Me ! Remember the dead drill sergeant Sunday morning ? " <p> iv . Like a reflex , the lump behind my ear throbbed and I recalled gray dawn light , an unfamiliar room , a guy in khaki sprawled motionless on the bed . All I knew was that the night before he had made a very bad mistake with me . <p> Memory of my path to that room was sketchy . All day Saturday , I had used cheap vodka and tap water to nurse a gruesome hangover . The Eye of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge from the party the night before had turned to black depression . <p> My Shadow 's absence felt more like an amputation than a release . The only mail was a couple of very overdue bills , nothing from the draft board . The thought of the army unnerved me . It was where I would be unraveled and dismembered . <p> Later , I must have gone out because the next thing I remembered happened that night on Third Avenue in the Fifties . That was a place I often went when drunk and broke . A voice called , " Fred ! " It was a big , bald guy with a mustache . I did n't recognize him . But if he knew that name we had done business in the past . <p> In my Upper East Side riff I was Fred , on the run from family and high school troubles . It was a tale that could move me to tears . Since coming to New York I had worked it for profit on the nice blocks of the Upper East Side . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much ask me for proof of being eighteen anymore . <p> A blank time followed his picking me up . Then deep in the night , I emerged from an ambulatory blackout to find myself in a white , tile-lined room . A shower ran . A big guy I did n't remember , a stranger in khaki , poked my bare chest and shouted , " You 're gon na get some military discipline , boy ! " <p> It was like he had pulled a trigger . My nightmare was n't the Viet Cong , it was being murdered in basic training . I threw myself on him . He yelled , " Fucking street trash ! " and slammed my head against the door . Everything went red and all sound was an echo as I went for his throat . <p> Early Sunday morning , I had come to face down on a thick carpet . The shower still ran in the bathroom . A shiver that turned into a convulsion passed through me . All of me hurt when I started to get up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes teared . <p> When I finally managed to focus , I saw the bed and on it , all akimbo and dead still , a big guy dressed in khaki . There were bruises on his neck . His head was at a weird angle . He must have decided to run a fantasy called drill sergeant and punk recruit . Maybe he had even explained that to me . <p> Had I left fingerprints ? Had anyone seen me ? My clothes were on a chair . My head spun as I dressed . Something in the room moved . Another shiver seized me . When I looked , two eyes , red , startled , stared back . " Oh no ! " He sounded scared . " Take what you want . But please go ! " <p> Monday I blocked that memory with the image of a child laughing against an overcast sky . " You are a menace , " my Shadow said . " Clearly we need another racket . " <p> v. With that he stepped into the roar of Schactman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hole in the wall serving lowly schleppers , haulers of goods . Thus the nickname , " Schlep 's . " <p> Two generations later it offered high and low , Jew and Goy , generous portions and the rudest service in the Garment District . The place was huge , a maze of alcoves . <p> Sarah Callendar was n't hard to spot . In the dead of winter , her skin and hair seemed magically touched with the sun . Others noticed her too , in that neighborhood . As much for the white and navy A-line Courreges knockoff she wore as for her looks . <p> She was married and had a kid . But I predated husband and child . We had known each other since college . As a fashion coordinator at Macy 's she was several steps up the ladder . But we shared the feeling of being undercover agents , spies from downtown . <p> When she and my Shadow hugged , Sarah looked puzzled . She knew something was wrong . This was n't me . But though she was very bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my double was something she did n't want to know about . And Sarah had the ability not to know . <p> " I thought we were going to look at your presentation this weekend . " <p> The anger and concern in her voice pleased my Shadow . Only ones who love you feel those things at the same time . " Hey , I saw the two Scotts out for a walk Sunday , " he said to change the subject . <p> It worked . At the mention of her kid , Sarah brightened immediately . " I wanted you to see . Yesterday , Scotty took six steps before he realized what he was doing and sat down . " <p> I felt a twinge at missing that . She paused like there was something she wanted to talk about . But she never mentioned troubles with Scott Senior , her husband . And since Scott was mainly about trouble , we never discussed him . <p> Just then the waitress appeared . " This the one you were waiting for , sweetie ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Both my Shadow 's stomach and mine lurched at the thought of food . Schlep 's , of course , served no booze , doubtless one reason Sarah wanted to meet there . He managed to order tea and cheesecake . She produced an envelope . ' q had some ideas for you . " <p> " Thanks . Here 's some of what I have . " He spread Les 's mockups of scarf , belt , hose , handbag hat , jewelry ads , like they were his own . <p> Speed had put a tiny tremor in his hands . Sarah simply did n't see that . " What 's your theme ? " she asked . <p> My Shadow gave her an idea I had worked on the night before : <p> ACCESSORIES AFTER THE FACT ABOVE THE LAW <p> As soon as he said that , he and Sarah shook their heads . She held up a pair of her sketches , one of a Victorian lady encased in clothes , the other of a lithe young woman in a miniskirt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaden , immobile , unfun . " <p> " Then came the revolution ! " said my Shadow . <p> ACCESSORIES COUP D'ETAT LIBERATING THE INNER YOU <p> It amused him that the talk about coups and the inner you made me squirm . <p> " What are you going to say about belts ? " she asked . All that I had thought of was : <p> A SOLID BELT <p> Because the line evoked for me a double shot of bourbon . My mouth watered . When I concentrated on Sarah and my Shadow again , they had a mockup of an ad with the headline in the shape of an S. <p> " Something like ' Suave , sensuous , ' " he said . <p> " Lithe , " she said , " Gliding . Like a snake . " <p> At its best , copywriting could be as amusing as a game . Her tuna salad and his cheesecake were delivered and eaten absentmindedly . They sat with their heads side by side . One of Sarah 's sketches for hats had a very family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sketch in a cigarette holder , " he said . " The headline is , ' The hat came back ! ' " <p> She said , " Like Mother swore it would . " <p> " At Darlington 's . . . But you know that ! " said my Shadow . " We need one more line . " <p> Suddenly a familiar voice asked , " Why 's a nice Irish boy like you doing in a place like this ? " The tall thin man with the nose and eyes of a falcon , Mr. Accessory from the Friday night party , stared at Sarah while asking me , " You 're keeping that offer in mind ? " <p> My Shadow smiled and nodded . Mr. Accessory turned away saying , " See you at the presentation . " <p> Sarah looked at his back with distaste and asked , " Who was that sleaze ? " <p> " Stephens , " said my Shadow and I remembered the name too . " The hotshot new buyer at Darlington 's . Big man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking about , my Shadow said , " We need to get back to work . " <p> I understood that he needed to go take more meth ; maybe Sarah too . " Give my regards to the Scotts , " my Shadow said when the two of them kissed and parted . It was too bad that in return for all Sarah 's love and understanding I regularly betrayed our friendship . Thinking of that , I remembered Sunday . <p> vi . My head rang right along with the bells . I was over on Avenue B. Spanish families walked home from church . In my pockets were bills scooped off the drill sergeant 's dresser and a pint of Smirnoff 's vodka bought out the back door of Old Stanley 's . <p> My nerves twitched , but my brain was still numb after my bad awakening . With chemical energy I thought I could work on my presentation . But it seemed the dealers had all gone to spend Sunday with their mothers . Then a familiar voice called , " Hey , Grierson ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond guy pushing this beautiful baby in a stroller : Scott Callendar father and son . <p> I guess the father 's looks were what Sarah had seen . And he generated a certain excitement . He was a preppy hood who liked to ride motorcycles and could n't hold a job . His appetite for booze and drugs was boundless . <p> But the son ! I had never really been around a baby . I crouched down face to face with him and he smiled . I would have loved to have seen him walk for the first time , just so some little piece of that weekend could be soft . The kid touched my face and gurgled . The father asked , " You looking ? " <p> Like I did n't want the kid to see me say it , I stood up . My mouth did n't work very well . " Yeah . " <p> And he said , " Twenty-five bucks for a spoon and I 'll take a third . " Scott Callendar was also a thief . Desperate , I nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid and he would make the run . <p> Before I could make that into words , he asked his son , " Scotso want to take a ride ? " The kid clapped his hands . As Scott turned the stroller I remembered it was an article of faith on the street that cops would not bust anybody with a kid . Knowing Scotty should not be touched by this , I still went along . <p> It was a chilly day , already getting dark . Scott turned down a tenement block . Ahead of us , a skinny guy with long , lank hair went into a building . Scott lifted the stroller onto the stoop . <p> Finally I managed to speak . " Man , this is not cool . " Scott looked questioningly . " I 'm staying here with the kid . " <p> As soon as the father disappeared inside , Scotty looked around and started to cry . As I crouched down to him , a woman , Polish or Ukrainian , wearing a babushka and overcoat like it was cold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . She looked at Scott , then stared at me like I was dirt . " Maybe he 's wet or something , " I suggested . <p> " He wants to be held , " she said in a voice like doom . " Pick him up . What kind of father ? " Then she ducked back inside . She was right . When I picked him up , Scotty stopped crying . But he stared at me wide-eyed , ready for a howl . <p> " Here . This . " The woman gestured us closer . With the fingers of one hand , she broke a lump of sugar , reached out the window and put a piece on the kid 's tongue . The sweetness calmed him . I held Scotty up in the air , against the gray sky , and he looked down at me and smiled . <p> At that moment I had felt the most intense love . Suddenly it seemed a simple thing to walk away from my tangled life . Before his father came back , I would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us somewhere . I 'd tell her the awful thing that her husband had just done . Of course , I 'd have to tell her my own lousy part in it . But at least it would be the truth . I had the stroller down on the sidewalk when Scott Senior reappeared . <p> vii . But , " said my Shadow , amused at my stupidity , " once he waved the speed , you handed the kid right back to him . " He was doing pasteups , working fast . " Nice intentions bum away when you got a habit like ours . " <p> The presentations were given in the conference room . Each copywriter in turn stood up in front of Jackie , Les , and the merchandise buyers involved , showed their ads and read their copy . Afterward they all offered comments . That afternoon , artwork , pictures of miniskirts , silver boots , striped bell bottoms with fringed cuffs , got hauled into the room and carted back out . <p> Accessories came last . As my Shadow rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fix , " said my Shadow , " is on . But you put us on such shaky ground that only that and luck can save us . " He strode in front of the audience , strung taut as a wire on the last of the meth . He set up his boards on a display easel , looked around the room and said : <p> DARLINGTON 'S AND YOU , ACCESSORIES BEFORE THE FACT . . . AND AFTERWARD <p> It was hard to tell how it was going over . Jackie Maye sat to one side of my Shadow , Les looked right through him . Mr. Stephens had a smile so bright it was radioactive . Jewelry came first . At one point my Shadow said : <p> A FASHION COUP D " ETAT UNLEASHES THE INNER YOU <p> Old Jess Gambelian the Jewelry buyer seemed to like that . At any rate he woke up and nodded , though English was not his first language , probably not even in the first five . Hosiery , handbags , scarves , shoes all got dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As part of the belt promotion there was the snakelike shape that read : <p> SO SMOOTH &; L I T H E SO SLEEK &; S U A V IT 'S SUEDE <p> He delivered the lines with a hiss . Jackie 's eyes gleamed , amused either by the act or at the fool he was making of himself . Mr. Stephens , whose department included belts , nodded approval . <p> It went okay as a performance . Hats were last . My Shadow put his final art up on the easel . This was a gamble ; Sarah 's sketch of the woman in the hat , with a cigarette holder , was a good-natured caricature of Jackie Maye herself . The copy read : <p> THE HAT CAME BACK ! LIKE MOTHER SAID IT WOULD ! AT DARLINGTON 'S . . . BUT YOU KNEW THAT ! <p> People understood , they looked toward Jackie to see if she found it amusing . My Shadow paused and delivered the punchline : <p> EVEN UNCLE MILTY KNEW THAT ! <p> * * * Finally , people chuckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . He grimaced . " Amusing I guess . But what 's he selling ? " It was clear to all that Les had written me off . <p> There was a moment 's pause when everything hung in the balance . Then Mr. Stephens spoke . " Great ! Punchy copy ! Nice look to the handbag and belt pages ! " <p> He turned to the other buyers . A couple of them shrugged . It was a presentation like a thousand others . But Jesse Gambelian suddenly awoke again and said in his unique accent , " Good . Good ! I like the Cadillac tie in . Darlington 's is a Cadillac store . " <p> Even my Shadow seemed baffled . " You said , ' A fashion Coupe de Ville , ' " Gambelian explained . " You got ta work the car into the art , though . " My Shadow nodded vigorously and made a note . <p> It was well after five . Other buyers were willing to file their comments later . People began to leave . My Shadow picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hold it a minute , Mr. Grierson . " And he was alone in the room with Jackie Maye . <p> She gestured for him to put up the last sketch again . While fitting a cigarette in the holder , she looked first at the caricature and then at him . When she spoke , her words flowed out on a cloud of smoke . " Your presentation was light on substance , but the buyers seemed to okay the presentation . And in this business the client is always right . " <p> Barnard and Brooklyn mingled in her voice . " You 've been around here long enough to know what chutzpa is ? " He nodded and she said , " Well , I have had precisely enough of yours . Come in here one more time like you did this morning and you 're out on your ass . " She indicated the sketch . " Change that art . Nobody outside the business knows me . But keep that Milton Berle reference . Good night . " <p> We had held the job . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted . Someone working late typed down the hall . Mr. Stephens , aka Mr. Accessory , waited at the elevator . " Give you a lift ? " <p> While the two of them caught a cab downtown , I was full of plans for my recovery . I would n't use drugs . Or booze . I 'd be at work at a quarter of nine . I 'd apologize to Les . " You thought over the deal we talked about ? " Mr. Accessory asked my Shadow . <p> " Yeah , " said my Shadow . " I need to supplement my paycheck . I 'd like to take my share in product . In fact I could use some tonight . " Mr. Accessory nodded . <p> " What deal ? " I wanted to know . <p> " He has speed connections all around the country . What he needs is for someone to bring it here . " <p> " I could get busted ! " <p> " Very unlikely . In a suit we still look respectable . " <p> Mr. Accessory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world with your bags crammed full of speed . And everybody will think you 're a kid visiting his family . " <p> My Shadow smiled and said , " A guy from a nice family would have matching Luis Vuitton bags . " As his partner thought that over , he told me , " If worse comes to worst , Scott Callendar can unload those along with some of the speed . " <p> As the cab barreled nearer , I told my Shadow , " Stay away from me . This time I mean it . " <p> viii . Sunday , far into the night , I snorted speed and drank beer , wandered my apartment trying in a frantic haze to get my mind fastened on ad copy . The place was strewn with scraps of paper on which were scrawled stuff like : <p> DARLINGTON 'S AND YOU ACCESSORIES AFTER THE FACT <p> When the drugs ran out , memories of the Luv Doll , the Drill Sergeant bobbed around in my head . Only Scott laughing against the sky did n't make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But by four in the morning , not even that worked . When the doorbell rang , I knew who it had to be . I buzzed my Shadow up . He was amused when he saw me . " I got something to make you relax . " It was heroin . I shied away . <p> " Cool out , man . " His tone was soft , coaxing . " The worse the addiction , the easier the cure . There are more guys walking around who have shed drug habits than ones who have stopped biting their nails . " The next thing I knew , he was going to work in my place . <p> ix . That evening from my bedroom , I heard the apartment door open , the two of them walk in . " I can make the first run this week if you want , " my Shadow said . He turned on a rock station . A bunch of English saps sang about Winchester Cathedral . He said , " Let me get changed . " <p> My Shadow came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Disappear , " I whispered . " Out of my life . And take Mr. Accessory with you . " <p> In his hands were opened letters . " You want to be Kevin Grierson ? Good . Here 's a notice from the landlord . But do n't worry , you wo n't need an apartment . Or a job . Here . " His tremor made the paper rattle . " Nine tomorrow morning , pre-induction physical at Whitehall Street followed by a bus ride to Fort Dix . " <p> The news froze me . " You 'll be too scared to resist . Bring a toothbrush . Decide where you want them to mail your clothes . By this time Tuesday . . . . " He ruffled my hair like he was clipping it , then walked over and sank down on the bed . <p> He said , " You 're dumb enough to deserve all that . But it would be the end of both of us . I can take care of tomorrow . Like I did today . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need a rest . Make yourself useful . Go talk to our friend about his plans . " <p> Before I could reply , Mr. Accessory called , " Hey , Key , want a hit ? " <p> Yes . I did . The voice behind me whispered , " It will take more than babies in the sky to untangle us , Kevin . " When I turned , the bed was empty and I was alone in the room . <p> <p> By Richard Bowes <p> Richard Bowes ' Kevin Grierson stories have become a popular feature in F &SF.; They 've also been reprinted in The Best from Fantasy &; Science Fiction , and in The Year 's Best Fantasy and Horror , edited by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling . The stories are set in New York City , and Bowes ' affection/or the city shows in every word <p> About the story , he writes , " I wrote fashion copy on Seventh Avenue in the late sixties . . . . That stretch of Seventh is now called Fashion Avenue . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o/the Garment District with its vast herds of clothing racks and huge department stores catering to a mass clientele is fading away . Darlington 's would by now be gone .
