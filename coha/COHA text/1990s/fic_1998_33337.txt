Angel Finn On the night river , everything seems far away , so far away it 's come back around to being close , and a man can need nothing and want everything , and wonder what his life 's all about at the same time that he knows . You ca n't see your line in the dark . It 's all sound and feel , and I swear there 've been times I smelled a strike coming before it came , a bigfish smell rising up to the water 's surface from down in the real dark . Sometimes a baitfish 'll go frantic before a strike , trying to swim away from the mouth opening behind it , hooked through the back and dangling in the current , and still something else kicks in when a big blue or channel cat comes gliding up out 've the murk . You got to start with the river , with its drop and slope and attention to gravity , and with the land out here that it drains . You got to start , far as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big freeze and thaw , and how time piles up on the land , and how sometimes you 'll see it all there , nothing lost , shining through the moment . A man drives a semiload of cattle downhill and crashes through town and wrecks things and kills himself and his wife and the cattle , most people 'll start with that . But I 'm thinking it 's surely funny how stories run backwards and how there 's nothing like a death for starting them . No story in this town ever followed time well . I 'd come off the river that morning , and the town was as quiet as it 's ever been . I parked the boat and went in to sleep , the sun barely thinning the dark in the east , and the next thing I know my neighbor 'd walked right into the house and was standing over me and shaking me because I would n't answer his pounding on my door . I followed him downtown and could n't believe what I saw . Leo Gruber was working within the sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wordless and steady , the only person there who seemed to know what he was doing , everyone else standing around or just following orders . I did some repairs to the store , then could n't see sense in listening to everyone guess at what 'd happened , so I went back to the river . Course if stories in this town do n't follow time too well , maybe that 's because time does n't follow itself too well . It 's like the river , with its back currents and side channels and backwashes , and its floodings when it does n't know its own banks and has to rise up over them to take a look around and sort of remember what it once was . Talk 's the same way . It loops and circles , gathers and runs , flows into something bigger than it knows , everyone pouring his own little stream in , till you ca n't tell if there 's a beginning or an ending , or if you 're in the main channel or a backwash or 've gone over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around about Two-Speed Crandall , but the talk 's all about something else , like a whirlpool still in its center and everything going around it . It 's like Two-Speed , now that he 's dead , and dead 's about as still as you can get , he 's drawn other stories to him , and they 're all whirling around , and people 're trying to see it all . There 're two ways to look at a whirlpool . You can watch the whole thing , and it 'll go smooth and wo n't seem to be moving at all , just standing there , a hole in the surface of the water . The other , you can watch one point go around , and you 'll see the movement then , but you ca n't see the whole whirl . Apply that to Two-Speed Crandall and take it for what it 's worth , which maybe is n't much , and you 've got what 's going on in this town . You can look down the river at night and see the moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look hard and solid , and you can think that 's the whole river , just what meets your eyes . Sometimes , even , just for the fun of deceiving myself , I 'll think it , that the moment I 'm seeing is everything , and the river 's got no depth or current or creatures or snags or old , invisible waters . Course it ai n't true , any more'n it 's true that all the stories going around this town are about Two-Speed Crandall . Why he hit my store I surely do n't know . Maybe it was an accident , maybe not . It 's easy to say it was , and maybe that 's the best reason to believe it , but I 've never yet met anyone who wanted to stay with the easy thing once he got started talking . Two-Speed was acting strange the last time I saw him , and I 've heard he and Leo Gruber never got along , so you 've got to wonder about Gruber 's cattle being on the truck , though I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Truth is , I know the sons better'n the fathers . The first time I saw Luke Crandall and Jeff Gruber down on the river together I thought it was an odd thing : Luke a skinny kid , a year younger than Jeff , looking about as substantial as a spiderweb next to Jeff , and with a kind of hot , surprised look on his face most of the time , like he did n't know what to expect of the world but he was determined it would n't be good , and then Jeff Gruber , solid and square as a cutbank when you come around a bend , and always looking like he knew what he was about . But there they were , down on the river together , jabbering like old friends , and I took a liking to them and started to teaching them things , and I never figured it was my business , even if I was curious , how they came to be friends when their fathers had such a reputation for not getting along . They had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , were n't down there just to drink and screw around , and that was enough for me , enough to take them fishing and show them what the river was and tell them what it 'd been and still is in the right chances , when it lies on the land its old self , nothing ever disappearing , just falling into a different kind of seeing . Anyway , you can look at Two-Speed Crandall all you want and figure what happened and guess and conjecture , you can be like Skeet Olson thinking the truth is in the events , and you can tell it over and over , thinking that if you just tell what actually happened enough times you 'll get somewhere -- but that 's just looking at the surface of the river and thinking you 're seeing the whole thing , forgetting it has a shape and form from way back . Talk often enough starts with the end of something , then circles around and finds itself , until people 're satisfied and settle down . But if you 're going to start at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to who knows where ? To why things freeze and thaw , including the heart sometimes , and why it sometimes wo n't thaw . People do n't know half themselves . That 's why I go fishing . I know I do n't know myself on the river , but I swear that it knows me . And sometimes it 'll let you in , and then you 'll realize how big and old it is , and how long water can flow . It happened to me once . Since then I 've been less worried about beginnings and endings , more kind of thinking there is n't much difference . I would n't start with Two-Speed at all . I 'd go as far back as you care to go , to the ways people know or do n't know the deepest waters , and do my guessing from there . Skeet Olson I 'm the only one actually seen it . Since they reamed out my veins I been walking every morning . I go out of my house down to Main Street , then head south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then west a mile , north a mile , east a mile back . I was at the curve on Highway 4 where it becomes Main Street when I heard the grunt of diesel above the hill . I looked up and could see smoke , a big thinning cloud growing into two black lines as they reached the edge of the hill . You 've seen how a semi looks coming over a hill . Like it 's coming out of the earth , some chrome and smoky bug emerging . There it was then , flat and big , the sun all of a sudden whambright on the windshield . And I stopped walking . He came over the hill , and the diesel smoke kept right on pouring out of the stacks . Kept right on pouring . I stood there and thought , What the hell ? What the hell ? It was one of those things where you ca n't even name what 's wrong , but your whole body knows it is . I did n't put it together like two plus two equals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four equals two plus two , except that the answer did n't make any sense , and the equation could have been a lot of other things , like three plus one , or two and thirteen-sixteenths plus whatever . New corn was growing in the fields , and a meadowlark sang on a fence post , and that diesel smoke went straight up into the sky , and I knew what was going to happen before I quite had the reasons I knew why . " Jesus , " I said . " He 's not slowing down . " I stood on the curve , halfway up the hill , on the shoulder of the road , and watched . The sound of the engine came down at me like it was hard and heavy enough to knock me off the road . It grew bigger and bigger , the cab red , the chrome stabbing me with sunlight . Coming down , coming down . Then over the sound of the engine I heard what if you go to hell and hear ghosts you 'll hear , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think such things . She keeps her mind on heaven , she tells me , because that 's where her salvation lies . And sure . But I intend to appreciate salvation by knowing what I 'm being saved from . And I do n't want to hear that sound again . When I fell on the floor that time and felt like death had a nail in its hand clawing around inside my chest , I thought not much could be worse . But I know now what 's worse -- to have death creep into you without a notice or muscle twitch and just sit there and stop your blood . When I heard that mooing , all those cattle -- and do n't ever tell me animals do n't know something about the future , all those cattle bellering and lowing , like some big off-key organ with a soul -- when I heard that coming down to me , my heart stopped entirely . I couldn't 've run if there 'd been a fire built under me . Couldn't 've run if there 'd been a flood . Down it came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I did . I looked to see if the town was still there , as if I thought maybe it 'd up and move when it saw this riot roaring down . But there it was all right , sitting like always . There it was , covered in trees , hardly none of the houses visible , just a couple of the church steeples sticking up . The St. John 's bells started ringing when I turned . Right then , they started ringing -- and this thing roaring down . I turned back . It was only a couple hundred yards away from me , and still gaining speed . " I ca n't believe , " I said . " I do n't . Who the hell ? " Then I knew . I knew the way the cattle knew . Then there he was , going by me , not even seeing me , I do n't believe . I was lucky enough to be on the outside of the curve , because he took it like a race car driver , swinging wide at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never once letting up on the accelerator . Two-Speed Crandall -- as if anyone does n't know . And LouAnn beside him on the other seat . Flick , and they were gone . Gone , and I was looking at the back end of the thing , the road ditch grass whirling in the eddies , and the cattle 's bellering coming back , and the meadowlark still singing , and the bells still going , and the diesel smoke curving over the trailer like two black horns and coming down to where I breathed . But there was a moment when they went by that I 'm not likely to forget . The sun left the windshield , and it was like I was staring into a dark , cool cave , and inside the cave were two faces that I knew , but they were n't like I 'd ever seen them before . Two-Speed was looking out , but all he saw was the road . He did n't have a look on his face . He did n't have an expression . It was like his face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that it ran right up the windshield and into his face . And that 's what he had there -- an expression without an expression , just lots of empty miles , like a road that goes nowhere and gets there too fast . LouAnn was sitting sideways in her seat , and she had her hand on the air-horn pull , and she was looking right at Two-Speed , who was n't looking at her , and she was ... well , I do n't know . Her mouth was moving , so I guess she was talking to him , but he was n't listening or caring . I got it like a photograph , that scene . Flick , and it 's there and gone , and not a chance to change it . I 'm gon na remember it for a long time . I 'm gon na remember it like this : Like they were carrying their own world down that hill . Like the space behind the windshield was something different than the space I was standing in . Like I did n't have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It sounds strange to say this , considering what was happening , considering what was going to happen , what did happen -- it sounds real strange -- but I ca n't think of nothing to make it clear but goldfish . Grace has a goldfish bowl , and I 'll be danged if I get it . Those fish just frustrate me . Stare at them long 's you want , they still got nothing to do with you . They ai n't in the world , not really . Once every day some food drops onto them from the world , some flecks of stink they eat . But that 's it . They 're in their own world , and they got their own space , and they do n't care about you , and I 'm not sure they care much about each other . Take it for what it 's worth , I do n't know . But sometimes I get the feeling , watching them fish , that if they could pick their world up they 'd smash it in your face -- just to do it . And suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . Just to spite your face . Dr. Piersoll I thought i 'd come out to the sticks after medical school , or what I thought was the sticks , and do some good for people instead of going after the bucks in suburbia . My reed school pals thought I was crazy . By the time I figured out that I had n't come here so much to do some good as to bless the people of the sticks with my suburban presence , I was too entrenched to move . I 'd brought babies into the world and watched them grow , and I knew their parents and had kids of my own who were their friends . And I knew all the stories . So I bought some land , and my wife and I promised each other we 'd go to Minneapolis once a month for theater or art , and we never kept that promise . Instead I learned to hunt ducks and pheasants and got pretty good at skeet shooting , and I trained my voice singing with the Lions Club at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's at the Guthrie this week , but I can probably tell you what became of most of the children I helped birth , or I can tell you what I 've heard of them . I know the talk that goes around as well as anyone , and I 'm as ignorant of the events . The truth is , there 's not much that anyone really knows about this last thing . We know this : Two-Speed Crandall came down the hill on Highway 4 with a semiload of Leo Gruber 's cattle . He made the curve into town and threaded the semi between two trees and hit the mayor 's new house with the swing of the trailer , opening up the living room , scattering two-by-fours and siding . He roared on down across the lawns of the entire block , leaving tracks in them all , then found another hole in the trees lining the sidewalk and emerged to descend on Main Street like a bowling ball among pins . You can imagine all this from the evidence . You do n't even need Skeet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately , the only eyewitness -- if that 's any claim to the truth . But the only thing he knows that you could n't figure out some other way is that Two-Speed was accelerating . And that just leads to questions , and guesses as to their answers . But the rest , what really happened , what we know -- well , a semi is n't subtle . The truck hit the bank , smashed its automatic teller , destroyed its facade , its plate glass , its plants inside the windows . Then it went back across the street to smack Angel Finn 's hardware store , sending files and hammers and hip waders spewing across the sidewalk . A twelve-pound maul , through some strange physics , flew across the street and embedded itself in the wooden front of the pool hall , where Walt Latham , the proprietor , had the good sense to leave it , as a draw to customers and an aid to conversation . Mooing and roaring , the truck left the hardware store , straightened out , and hit the brick barbershop at the T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have gone right through and out the other side , but the bank and hardware store had slowed it down . The cab penetrated and came to a stop inside the building . Two-Speed Crandall was ejected through the windshield . He came to rest upside down over the second and never-used barbershop chair . There 's some symbolism there . In death as well as life he did n't quite fit the places where he landed . LouAnn was with him . She remained inside the cab . And that 's all anyone knows for sure . By the time I got there the police and firemen had extricated her and Two-Speed and were placing them inside an ambulance , needlessly . I checked them , but then climbed into the ambulance anyway and went with them to the hospital in Clear River . I 'd helped to birth their sons , and even here anymore , you 've got to protect yourself against any claim to carelessness . Through the back window of the ambulance I saw the firemen washing off the street . They did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared them for anything like this . They were used to hooking up hoses and turning nozzles on problems , so that 's what they did . The water crashed out , white with air , and hit the mass of blood flowing from the cattle in the semi , and ran in pink froth down the gutters . Only later , when Leo Gruber arrived , would he see what had to be done . The firemen , I 've heard , shut off their hoses when he stepped from his car . They watched as he walked to the wreckage of the semi and peered through the slats , and in the silence they heard for the first time the hoarse breathing of cattle . Until then no one had stopped to listen . Leo turned and walked to the fire chief and asked for a four-wheel-drive pickup with a winch . But you see how quickly you move from the evidence . Already I 'm telling what I 've been told . Pop Bottle Pete Sometimes the sun 's real hot . Sometimes it 's real hot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an egg . I fry . Just like an egg . But the bottles 're cool . They 're in the grass . In the ditches in the grass . People throw them away . Cans too . Sometimes I see them . But not usually . I usually do n't see them throw them away . If I saw , I 'd know where to look . Usually I just walk and look . Because they do it at night and always . Even in winter , when I stay home . So I have to walk and look . When the sun 's real hot I feel like an egg . I sizzle . I sizzle with my mouth . Sizz-z-z-z-z-le . Like an egg . But I still look . The bottles 're cool . The cans are n't cool , but the bottles are . They 're both in the grass , but the bottles are always cool . Sometimes there 's something in them . I 'll sometimes taste . If no one 's coming on the road . So they do n't think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticks at my mouth . I 'd like to play volleyball on a beach . With girls . That 'd be the real thing . People wave to me . They honk their horns . I wave back . They wave and honk their horns . If a semi goes by , I raise my fist and go up and down with it . Sometimes they pull the big horn . Wa-a-a , wa-a-a-a . Like a ship . Like fog . When they do that , even if it 's hot , I do n't feel like an egg . I feel like lost in a fog . Like I wish they would pull the big horn always and make me feel fog lost . He always did . Wa-a-a-a , wa-a-a-a , wa-a-a-a-a , until I could n't hear it no more . I did n't have to raise my hand for him . He 'd start way before . Before I even saw him . Wa-a-a-a-a , wa-a-a-a . I always knew it was him , cause he 'd start way before . Wa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a , he 'd sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship and he was a ship . In the cool fog . But we were n't going to hit . Then he 'd yell my name . Not Pop Bottle like most people . He 'd yell Pe-e-e-e-eter-r-r . Big and loud . Out his window , going by . He 'd stop his horn so he could yell . My name . I 'd open my eyes , and there he 'd be . Grinning at me . Waving . I 'd yell back and wave . Si-i-i-i-im-o-o-o-n . Not Two-Speed like most people . His name . Simon . We 'd yell our names at each other and wave and laugh . Then , when he was past me , he 'd throw a bottle out . One I could return . They 're worth a nickel . People throw them away . But all you have to do is take them back , and they 'll give you a nickel . Or a dollar if you have enough . He threw it out because we yelled our names at each other . Then he 'd wa-a-a-a again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never felt like an egg then . I felt cool and good . He was just feeling like an egg . Like he was sizzling and sizzling , and he could n't find something cool . Sometimes if I do n't find a bottle for a long time , and the sun 's real hot , I 'll feel like smashing myself . Just to let the hot out . That 's what he did . Because he could n't find something cool . You ca n't feel like an egg all the time . You have to smash yourself . I never sold the bottles he threw . I got them on a shelf . I probably got enough , I could buy a Walkman . But I 'd rather have the bottles . He always wa-a-a-a-ed and waved and called my name . And I called Simon .
