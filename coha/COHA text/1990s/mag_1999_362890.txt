Chances are slim that you will soon be hearing the following line spoken in theatergoing homes across America : " Hey , honey , let 's grab the kids , fly to New York and catch that new musical The Dead ! " Yet , oddly , a musicalized version of James Joyce 's somber short story has been one of the most anticipated events of the off-Broadway season . A star-filled cast ( Christopher Walken , Blair Brown , Sally Ann Howes ) has perked up interest in what is either the most intriguing or the stupidest idea for a musical in years . <P> Alas , James Joyce 's The Dead ( adding the author 's name still wo n't boost the group sales ) turns out to be neither wondrous nor wacky but just kind of wan . The musical numbers , written in traditional Irish style by Shaun Davey , are , with a couple of exceptions , simply songs being performed at Julia and Kate Morkan 's annual Christmastime gathering  --  a gathering that provides an epiphany for their nephew Gabriel . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails to register . One problem is that adapter Richard Nelson has moved the pivot of the story  --  a song that stirs memories in Gabriel 's wife ( Brown ) of a long-dead boy who once loved her  --  to earlier in the evening , thus throwing off the rhythm of the piece . ( Another change : she sings the song rather than hears it . ) What 's more , Walken seems blandly disengaged as Gabriel , missing the psychological tension , singing indifferently and barely hinting at an Irish accent . Walken used to be a Broadway dancer , but here he 's just a misstep . <P>  --  By Richard Zoglin
