I DETEST CHRISTMAS and reserve a special sort of loathing for those who use the designation " Xmas . " Even though I 've been told the " X " is a perfectly suitable and respectful way to represent the name of Christ , I know those who write " Xmas " do it wholly out of laziness . <p> When we meet in Jane 's new hometown for the holidays , Jane comes to the restaurant table wearing a hat with a long blue-black feather , dangly earrings , and a short , black , forties-style jacket . Blue mascara tints her eyelashes  --  I can see it even in the dim light of the restaurant  --  and her lips are the color of gin cherries . She kisses me on the cheek . " I ca n't believe it , " she says , leaning close . A tear escapes one eye and rolls slowly down her face , alongside her nose . I stand and put my arms around her . " My little sister Marissa , " she says . Inexplicably , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane type . My sister weeps now , and rests her head on my shoulder , the feather dusting my nose . <p> I pat her back gently . " Sssh , " I say , while my husband , our parents and Jane 's new boyfriend share a look of dazed politeness . <p> Her shoulderblades are hard against my hands , like folded wings , and I feel I must hold her just a few moments more to keep her here with us , on the ground . <p> Sometimes these details are all I 've got to get me by , the details of houses : walls and beams , dust , knickknacks , the dizzying interplay of planes and angles . The shades hide windows . We know we could raise them , but if we do n't , it 's as if there 's no outdoors , only the massive house on the happy corner , the house of nails and screws turning while we sleep , the house of tears and remembering , the house where the dust floats silvery on needle-thin rays of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I drink a shot of vodka and feel the warmth flowing all the way down to my stomach . I remember the statistic , the percentage leaping into my mind as if through a small gate with a latch . Only 11.7 percent of the population has more than three drinks a day . Who counts us , I wonder , looking at my sister 's dresser , where a lace runner has been laid on top of a piece of mauve cloth . Maybe it 's silk , I think , rubbing my finger on the cloth where the lace has opened into a design . My sister has a flair for hanging and combining things : a cloth here , a twig there , a feathery fan , a fringed shawl laid over the bed , Balinese masks in the bathroom . Jane pushes the boundaries of taste while I observe them , matching rugs and drapes and bedspreads . My sister says houses are like soup , you can put anything you want into them . <p> I hold the hand mirror from our grandmother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dresser mirror , and an infinite progression of images of me tunnels into both mirrors . I shiver and hear my mother say , " Someone is walking over your grave . " What does that mean ? At least I have now understood infinity , if not the other thing . Mortality ? That will have to wait . <p> " Oh , stop with your dreams , already , " is what I say to myself when I ca n't tell where the images floating through my mind come from . Houses are at the center of dreams . In dreams , the space of houses is both immense and ever so small . <p> I dream of a locked house . I work at the lock with a screwdriver , my face close to the knob . I free the first screw , then the second , and the door swings open . I started my break-in in darkness , but now the first bruised light of dawn is showing . I must hurry . The people who lived here have left all of their belongings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds , antique chests and tables , overstuffed couches and chairs . In a room full of metal toys a hideously painted clown gives me a shiny grin , and flecks of paint shower down . He wears a pointed red hat and opens his bare metal arms to me . Come , he says , you 're home . <p> Jane and I had our own rooms when we were growing up , a luxury I did not fully appreciate until I saw the dark and ancient houses of the poor when I came to their children to tutor , bearing books , plastic letters and games , and a bright collegiate grin . I could better have brought them some deeper kind of care , a house where the roaches did n't skitter across the curling linoleum at night . Food . Health . My four-year-olds spoke in monosyllables , not even reaching for sentences , their noses thick with mucus , their eyes wide with fear , perhaps , at my overly shining , optimistic countenance . <p> Long before those days , Jane slept in her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I peeked once , early on a hot , dreary Saturday morning , when I knew Jane would be fast asleep . She lay on her back , covers to her breastbone , so I could just see that she wore her heaviest flannel nightgown . I watched for the rise and fall of her chest but saw nothing . A thick white layer of dust covered the vanity where her brush , comb and jewelry box were perfectly arranged , as if they 'd been untouched for centuries . With my last quick sweep of the room , before I pulled the door gently closed , I saw there was no clutter of the sort in my room , no scattering of clothes and shoes and books , only thousands of crushed pink tissues layering the chifforobe , strewn across the carpeted floor , and overflowing the pink plastic wastebasket . I never spoke to her about her room , nor did I ever peep into its pink recesses again . <p> Jane writes that she is coming to visit us . She is sick at heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair . Her heart is so heavy , she writes , she imagines herself carrying it before her in a wheelbarrow . I tell my husband Jane is coming , without mentioning the wheelbarrow , and he nods benignly , accepting my sister as family and the family as sacrosanct , no matter how trying or strange . We have together practiced our tolerance in this very house , during the visits of his father , Al , the dapper announcer for auto-daredevil shows who punctuates his conversation with references to Evel Knievel in " the old days , " and his mother , Fran , who forces coins upon us from a bulging , jangly purse . " Y ' never know when you might need change , " she says , filling our candy dishes with quarters and dimes despite our protests . Fran owns a wig shop and must have , herself , fifty different styles  --  from red and brown wigs with sleek pageboy drops to wigs with cascades of black or platinum curls . I 've never seen her wear her own hair , not once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a wave of her manicured hand , " from nuns in Ecuador . " <p> " You know that ? " she asked me years ago , when Ted and I were first married . " Nuns sell their hayar . " She emphasized the last word , resting a red nail on my forearm . " It 's the purest sweetest hayar because they are virgins . " <p> When Ted and I pick up Jane at the airport , I 'm startled to see her rumpled clothes and her hair , uncombed and flattened on one side from sleeping on the plane . She turns her blue-outlined eyes to me and says , " I 've been remembering when we were little in our house on Second Terrace . Do you remember that house ? " <p> I nod . <p> " I loved that house , " she says , stopping in the middle of the concourse , her eyes filling with tears . We both stop with her ; all three of us become flotsam jamming the flow of travelers hurrying to their planes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lurches into motion and dabs at her eyes . She looks at me soulfully , the blue eyeliner run to lacy patterns under her lower lashes . " I had some secrets , " she says solemnly . I remember the Kleenex , billowing across the floor of her room like pink smoke , strewn everywhere , a multitude of crumpled blossoms , and Jane 's figure immovable as death , swathed in the bed coverings . <p> " I wanted to be a saint , " she laughs daintily . " When I stayed in my room all those times I was reading Lives of the Saints and taking communion . Bread and grape juice all day long . " She nods to herself . " Bread and grape juice and oh , endless prayers to Mary . Sometimes in the mornings , while I was still in bed , I 'd pretend I was a saint , already gone to my reward . " I want to ask her about the pink Kleenex  --  maybe they were supposed to represent flowers strewn by the faithful  --  but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd rather not upset the balance . <p> " I wish I had some blood , " she hisses suddenly , fiercely , while we 're waiting for her bags . My heart nearly stops . " It 's disgusting what people will do for their own vanity , " she says more loudly , her attention directed toward a young woman in jeans wearing a full-length black mink coat . <p> " Yes , " I say , reaching for her bag . " Let 's get out of here . Ted 's waiting out front . " <p> " You should be ashamed , " she says to the woman as we pass her , in a voice for the woman 's ears only , each word a honed and poisonous weapon . <p> In our living room , Jane gazes at the Seth Thomas clock that belonged to our grandmother . Touching the glass dome lightly with her first two fingers , she bends down a little so the clock is at eye level . With a gasp , she throws her head back , as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face drawn into harsh lines . " It 's stopped . " <p> I shrug my shoulders . " I guess it 's broken . It has n't kept time for a few months . " <p> She looks back at the clock . I see my own face in the mantel mirror , next to Jane 's but farther away . Yet hers is the face that 's shrunken and drawn . We keep this pose , staring at the clock and our faces , for several minutes , until I finally turn away . " Jane , " I say softly . " Would you like something to eat ? Can I get you a drink ? " <p> " Yes , " she whispers , her mouth curving into a near smile . " Yes . " <p> Jane is awake before me , the Yellow Pages open in front of her on the kitchen table . Her hair is flattened in that same peculiar way , as if she 's slept sitting up . <p> " The clock , " she says , before I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the kinds of things I want to say right away to guests in my home . I 'm getting irritable , having to think about a broken clock so early in the morning , but I smile and lay my hand on hers , a gesture so unlike me that she just looks at me without finishing her sentence , her mouth open a bit , poised for the next word . <p> " The clock ? " I ask . <p> She points to an advertisement in the Yellow Pages . " Is this close ? " <p> " About two miles or so . " <p> " I 'd like to get the clock repaired . It was Grandmother 's . " <p> " I know that , " I say , a bit snappishly now . <p> Her eyes are fluttery when she turns back to me , as if I am too bright to look at . I 'm ashamed . I have n't even started to care for her yet and already I 've caused her tears . She slips her hand from mine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting her hand on her chest as if she 's ready to recite the Pledge of Allegiance . " Did I mention that ? " <p> " Yes , " I say , " the pain . " <p> She walks to the window and puts her hands on the sill . " Not pain exactly . Weight , a heaviness . Something gaining mass while growing harder and smaller . " <p> " Jane , take the car , " I say quickly . " Drop me off at work and take the car . I have to work today , but I 'm not going in tomorrow , then there 's the weekend . We can go to the mountains . There 's a new state park just outside the city . " My words spill out , each a little rough thing touching another and glancing off , like rumbling stones in a polisher . <p> Jane takes a breath and turns . " All right , " she says brightly , " I 'll take the clock in . " <p> When Jane was fourteen she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a backyard to the driveway she thought was just below . It was dark , though , and she did n't see it was one of those yards built up high from the garage . She jumped down much farther , six feet or more , and fractured her back in several places . Only she did n't find out about the fractures until she had an X ray years later . She 'd been grounded that night and should n't have been out of the house at all . Afterwards , she was determined not to tell anyone but me . How she stood the pain , I 'll never know . Once , she broke both arms , taking a corner too fast and tumbling over the handlebars of her bicycle . She was still Juliet in the school play , her casts hidden in the vast sleeves of her costume . I could think of a dozen stories more , maybe fifty , counting all the small skirmishes and standoffs , counting everything Jane 's taken on in her life . Her son was born on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her ax-husband tied the cord themselves . Joshua 's twelve now and alternates living with his father and Jane , a year at a time . Believe me , I could tell you more about Jane , how she 's been so good at taking people on , taking them in , taking chances , risking her neck  --  you know  --  and then standing the consequences , the pain , whatever . <p> Jane leans an elbow jauntily out the window of my car as if she 's driving a Ferrari . Her face is radiant , her hair full and curled with a nimbus of light around it . She pats the seat beside her . " Hop in , " she says . " The clock 's not fixed , but it 's in superb hands . " In her voice are the sounds of tinkling ice and parties on the lawn . I put on my sunglasses against the dazzle of the sun and my sister 's glittering-with-romance eyes , and wait . <p> " Superb hands , " she repeats . " Steady , patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking out the driver 's side window . I feel an urgent fluttering in my stomach and realize I 'm disappointed a total stranger , and a man , at that , has assuaged my sister 's pain before I 've even had half a chance . <p> " I was abducted by a couple who held me for ransom , " he says calmly , over after-dinner coffee . His name is John Linden . He repairs clocks for a living and Jane wanted us to meet him . Only because Jane has asked him to , he 's telling us his story . The flicker of reluctance that crossed his face at first gave way almost instantly to a look of patient resignation , the expression he has worn virtually the whole evening  --  the face , I suspect , he lives in . He strokes his salt-and-pepper beard gently , then raises a thin hand . " It was a case of mistaken identity , " he says . " They mistook me for the banker 's son . We did go to the same school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , same initials . But my father was a baker , not a banker . My captors were n't very smart , you see . Ha , ha , " he says . <p> My husband leans forward , listening intently , the last two inches of his tie submerged in his coffee . I try to catch his eye , and when he glances my way I look down and nod ever so slightly . Thinking my gesture to be a sign of amazement at John 's story , he gives his own head a little meditative shake and nods back . <p> " We did n't have much money , " John is saying , " but we always had good bread to eat . " He pauses and smiles a shy , self-deprecating smile . " I missed that bread most of all when I was in the cage . " <p> I look into his storm-cloud-colored eyes and search for a flash of something  --  anger , perhaps , bewilderment that such a thing could have happened to him , or hatred  --  but his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They tied my wrists and ankles and threw me into the trunk of a rusty old Bonneville and drove to a dilapidated shack they had outside of Tucson . Of course I only found out later it was Tucson . They kept me in a wire cage , two of them , Mattie and Boom , they called themselves . " He takes a sip of coffee . " The cage was about four-and-a-half feet square , yes , and I stayed in it for twenty-three hours a day . They gave me water and let me cook and eat all the birds and lizards I could catch . " <p> Jane 's voice comes across the table , a dry quavery whisper that 's the sound of someone parting branches in the woods . " Three months , " she says . " How did you endure that ? " <p> He looks at her , then glances around the table . " Your tie is in your coffee , " he says matter-of-factly to my husband . <p> This launches an embarrassed flurry of activity on my husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving away from the table , his chair scraping annoyingly across the wood floor . <p> John Linden waits , unperturbed . " Patience , " he says , finally , after things have settled back down again . <p> " I hope they put those two away for a long time , " my husband says . <p> " They went to jail , yes , but I bore them no ill will . The act of revenge accomplishes nothing . Even the desire for revenge springs from narcissism "  --  he pauses  --  " or some other kind of impoverished thinking . " He shakes a closed hand as if he is about to throw dice , but then puts the fist gently down on his napkin and looks deeply into his coffee cup . <p> For a time , we all fall silent . <p> " I do n't think about those days much anymore . I do dream once in a while , " he admits . " I 'm closing my hand over the small body of a bird and I feel its heartbeat just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one . " Just before I kill it , " he says . " Then I wake up drenched with perspiration . " His voice grows soft . " And shaking . " <p> I think if we all clasped hands and closed our eyes , we 'd suddenly be there , all of us together , in John 's nightmare , and I fight the impulse even to blink , until my eyes hurt and dark amoeba shapes swim frantically across my field of vision , reminding me that I am not allowed to be alone , even in my own body . <p> When I come into the living room the next morning , Jane is listening to a tape that plays the sound of waves along with a repetitive kind of music . I stand beside her for a minute or two until she looks up , her whole face graced with the expression of someone staring out of a holy painting . Her eyes flutter closed . <p> " Listen , " she says , " can you hear the message ? " <p> I listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinkling music , the same notes coming around again and again , like the melody of the neighborhood ice-cream truck . <p> " I am calm , " she says . " The music tells me there are angels sitting on my lap right now . " She opens her eyes and scans my face . " Or there could be . I have to believe there could be . " <p> Later , when we go to the supermarket , Jane strikes up a conversation with a thin , sad-faced man holding a sign with the words " I will work for food " written in black marker . She follows me through the store , her hand on the basket . " Painting , " she says . " Could n't he paint one of your rooms ? Weeding , cleaning . Marissa , " she pleads . " He does n't have a home , he does n't have anything . You 're angry . Please do n't be angry with me . " <p> But I 'm not angry . I feel nothing and want to pinch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to share a little in her suffering . " Let 's talk about it at home , " I say , stalling , and we take a longer route through the parking lot to our car , so as not to pass the homeless man again . <p> I lie in bed exhausted , looking at the white expanse of ceiling . I am thinking of making love to a man who has eaten lizards , and I shudder with a kind of horror . My hand is closed tightly over a pill I 've found in the bathroom . It 's a tranquilizer called Ativan . I 've learned this by looking in my sister 's suitcase while she 's out with John . " Take every six hours for anxiety , or as needed , " the instructions read . I open my hand and look at the dot of white on my palm , shaped just like an appealing little house . I bring my hand slowly to my face until the lines of life , love , and knowledge are closer than I 've ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take the tiny pill into my mouth . <p> Ted comes in and settles into bed . We turn out the lights and lie together in the darkness . The night air is sultry . <p> " Tell me the strangest things you 've ever eaten , " I say , sitting up beside him . <p> " I ate a big bite of horseradish once . I thought it was mashed potatoes . " He laughs . <p> " Anything else ? " <p> " White paste . Oh , and my mother 's best friend Rita gave her a box of chocolate-covered ants once for her birthday . I had some of those . " <p> " Is that all ? " <p> " I think so , " he says . " I ca n't remember anything else . " <p> " That 's okay . It 's okay , then , " I say , leaning toward him in the darkness and pressing my lips against his , hearing , just as we kiss , the faint sound of a door opening and closing , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my life . <p> <p> By ELEANOR SWANSON <p>
