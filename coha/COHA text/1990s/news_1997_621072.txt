<p> In recent weeks I 've found myself fooled by the extended daylight hours . I think there 's lots of time to do this and that before dinner  --  after all , the sun is still shining  --  when suddenly I realize it 's already 8 . <p> Then I agonize over dinner . <p> Bun , I say to myself . Bun is cool noodles  --  vermicelli-style rice noodles  --  served at room temperature with shredded lettuce , herbs and meat toppings . A favorite dish from my childhood , it 's quick to prepare ( only takes me 20 minutes ) , delicious and satisfying  --  and my husband loves it . <p> My eyes then light up again ; it 's not so late anymore . <p> In Vietnam , my sister and I adored this dish so much we ate it two or three times a week . Walking home from school , we often stopped at Chi Ba 's , known in the neighborhood for her most exquisite bun specialties . <p> Housed in a makeshift food court of sorts , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand included a counter and a squeaky bench that sat six customers at most . Though simple and spare , it was always enticing , with two large baskets gracing the front , one lined with banana leaves and piled high with two to three feet of con bun  --  freshly made noodle " nests "  --  and the other with mounds of shredded greens . <p> Once seated on the crowded bench , we ordered our usual : bun with grilled pork for my sister and bun with beef for me . Then we grabbed our chopsticks , clutching them while watching our meals being cooked . Working with a deft hand , Chi Ba quickly threw a couple of pork skewers on the grill . Upon contact , the meat immediately sizzled , its sweet , smoky aroma teasing us even more . <p> Then , to get ready for the beef , she placed a small wok on a kerosene stove and fired it up . <p> While waiting , she assembled the bowls , grabbing a handful of fat , juicy bean sprouts , shredded lettuce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , as the wok got smoking-hot , she stirred in some shallots and beef , twirling it around and emptying the steaming mound into my bowl . <p> A few minutes later , she slipped the cooked pork off the skewers and placed them on my sister 's noodles . <p> Once the bowls were safe in our hands , we reached into a large jar of do chua , or pickled shredded daikon and radish , and pulled out a clump to garnish our noodles . After adding some scallion oil and chopped roasted peanuts , we drizzled on Vietnamese Dipping Sauce . <p> We turned the noodles a few times , then devoured them , delighting ourselves once again in bun heaven . <p> These days , my fondness for bun is even greater . Not only is it infinitely delicious , but it points to a fascinating and important aspect of Vietnamese cuisine  --  abundant use of fresh herbs and rice noodles , and small portions of meat . Besides the health factor , bun dishes highlight an important technique in flavor building  --  playing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as well as textures ( crunchy bean sprouts and soft , leafy lettuces ) . <p> In Vietnam , bun is served with beef , shrimp and vegetables . But you can also substitute fish or chicken . To create interesting variations , try different herbs and sauces , such as Soy-Lime or Vietnamese Dipping Sauce flavored with ginger or cilantro . <p> But the real key is to buy the right kind of noodles . Fresh bun is hard to find , but the dried ones work just as well . Made with rice flour , water and salt , bun ( also called rice vermicelli ) is off-white and translucent , with tiny strands similar to angel hair pasta . <p> Available at Asian grocery stores , it 's packaged in one-pound cellophane bags . There are many brands , but I prefer Thap Chua and Pagoda . ( Do not confuse these noodles with the flat , linguine-style rice noodles used for pad Thai , or the straight , Japanese-style wheat noodles . ) <p> Cook bun in boiling water for about four or five minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to come to room temperature . Do not over-rinse , because the noodles will loose their stickiness . <p> With a jar of Vietnamese Dipping Sauce handy in the refrigerator , you can whip up a bun dish in no time . It 'll be tasty , satisfying and healthy  --  and you do n't even have to cook that much . <p> SCALLION OIL ( MO HANH ) <p> INGREDIENTS : <p> * 1/2 cup vegetable oil <p> * 5 scallions or green onions , chopped <p> INSTRUCTIONS : Heat the vegetable oil in a small saucepan set over moderate heat .
