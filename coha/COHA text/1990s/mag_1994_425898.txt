Section : A tale of two banks Ed Crutchfield and Hugh McColl acquired their way to the top in banking . Now that takeover premiums are high , they 're both on the sidelines  --  temporarily . <p> SLOUCHING IN HIS CHAIR and drawing on a cigarette in his 40th-floor office overlooking downtown Charlotte , N.C. , First Union Corp . Chairman Edward Crutchfield Jr . sums up his feelings on the current state of banking . This is awful to say , ' says the 53-year-old Crutchfield , but what we need is a good , cold , killing frost . ' <p> Translation : Too many bank stocks have gotten too expensive . This is a problem for Crutchfield and his cross-Charlotte rival , NationsBank Corp . ' s chairman , Hugh McColl Jr . Crutchfield and McColl have built their banks into the U.S. ' ninth- and third-largest financial institutions ( respectively ) by acquiring dozens of smaller , usually weaker banks . Today First Union 's asset base exceeds $74 billion ; NationsBank 's , $171 billion . <p> Crutchfield and McColl would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with assets from $1 billion to $20 billion  --  expect too much of a premium . To buy a decent bank in this range , Crutchfield or McColl would probably have to pay at least two times the target 's book value , at a time when their own banks are selling below 1.5 times book . <p> Unwilling to pay big premiums and thereby dilute their banks ' earnings , the two bankers have decided to wait for the next killing frost  --  the next down cycle in banking  --  when weaker competitors can be picked off at reasonable prices . ( Unless , of course , a good opportunity presents itself sooner . ) As they wait , Crutchfield and McColl are employing similar strategies , which they believe will put their banks in even stronger positions for the next downturn , 12 to 24 months from now . <p> Both chairmen are streamlining their organizations . First Union is somewhat further along than NationsBank in the crucial task of improving efficiency . When Crutchfield began expanding out of state , in 1985 , First Union was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put all of its acquisitions on the same system right from the start . Today First Union is one of the few multistate banks with virtually all of its banks and branches tied into the headquarters ' computer system , and offering standardized products on standardized forms . <p> First Union has also nearly completed the introduction of commercial lending practices that are reducing from eight weeks to three days the time it takes to approve a commercial loan . A similar reorganization is just beginning on the consumer lending side . Coupled with other savings , these measures should lower First Union 's efficiency ratio ( operating expenses divided by net interest income plus noninterest income ) to 59% by year-end . This would be down from 67% five years ago , and six percentage points below the industry average . The goal , says First Union President John Georgius , is 55% . <p> At NationsBank , Hugh McColl has cut the efficiency ratio from 67% in 1988 to about 61% today , in part by routing most paperwork to centralized administrative centers . This frees the lending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to close a loan . On routine home equity loans , for example , NationsBank tries to approve ( or turn down ) an application within four hours ; most of the time the process takes only 30 minutes . <p> McColl figures that streamlining his lending operations will save NationsBank at least $50 million a year starting in 1998 . Crutchfield puts First Union 's savings at around $30 million a year . <p> But the bigger point is that Crutchfield and McColl are at the forefront of converting their bank branches from paperwork processors to revenue-generating machines . Says Brent Erensel , banking analyst with UBS Securities : The real guts and glory in banking now belong to companies with strong revenue growth . ' <p> As they streamline their lending operations , Crutchfield and McColl continue to invest heavily in making their companies less like banks and more like the companies that have for a decade been stealing their deposit bases  --  Merrill Lynch , General Electric Capital Services , the mutual fund houses . Last year 35% of the $1.5 billion ( $5.78 a share ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants that percentage closer to 50% . <p> Crutchfield is less ambitious on this score , but has further to go . He wants First Union 's traditional banking versus nontraditional income to split at about 70%/30% ; last year nontraditional services contributed 12% to First Union 's $4.73-a-share earnings . <p> How did NationsBank get so far ahead of First Union in developing its nonbank businesses ? McColl started earlier and moved faster . Back in the early 1980s he saw mutual funds and others eating into the commercial banks ' share of deposits and business credit ( the banks ' share of business credit has shrunk from 60% in 1980 to 30% now ) . To build NationsBank into a full-service commercial/investment bank able to underwrite debt and equity offerings , provide merger and acquisition services and everything else Merrill Lynch , J.P . Morgan and General Electric Capital Services can do , McColl began wooing Wall Streeters to Charlotte . In July 1993 he paid $225 million for Chicago Research &; Trading Group Ltd. , a $7 billion ( assets ) derivatives trading group . In early November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market international mutual funds . <p> Last year NationsBank 's investment banking and trading units contributed $1.7 billion , or 24% , of the company 's $6.8 billion in revenues . Also last year NationsBank syndicated more major corporate loans than anyone else and was fourth in dollar amount . McColl would like to see the investment banking and trading groups increase their revenues and earnings 20% a year . <p> McColl also expects 20% annual growth from the company 's newest business line , its nonregulated finance companies . Last year McColl acquired Chrysler First Inc. ( with $4.5 billion in assets ) , and U S West Financial Services Inc. ( $2.3 billion in assets ) . The Chrysler unit provides consumer and small business financing for such things as major household appliances and retail inventory . The U S West division provides leasing , corporate financing and other financing to companies . Look for more acquisitions in this area . <p> Across Charlotte at First Union , Crutchfield is playing catch-up in the capital markets and investment banking arenas . We 're late to the party , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushing First Union into derivative products , lease financing , merger and acquisition services , and securities underwriting , among others . <p> Crutchfield plans to sell these products and services primarily to the some 110,000 small and midsize companies in the seven states where First Union has banking operations . Commercial banking will significantly diminish with smaller and midsize companies just as it did with the big ones , ' he says . As investment banking services become available to small businesses , they 'll abandon commercial banks . ' He hopes the new services First Union will offer will help tie these customers to his bank . <p> Crutchfield and McColl have been criticized in the past for sacrificing profitability to rapid expansion . Over the past five years First Union and NationsBank have produced average returns on shareholder equity of 13.7% and 13.4% , respectively . Compare this with 15.2% for southeastern competitor Wachovia Corp. , and 16.1% for Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks . This is one reason NationsBank and First Union sell at 7.1 and 7.6 times forward earnings , respectively , a slight discount from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowing to this criticism , Crutchfield says he will double First Union 's asset size , to $150 billion , if that is what it takes to remain a dominant player . McColl , meanwhile , talks about buying banks with assets ranging from $20 billion to $40 billion . Both say they want to expand in markets that are growing fast and/or are home to lots of businesses . McColl says he likes the Midwest . Crutchfield mentions the Northeast . <p> For now , Crutchfield and McColl say they 'll wait until their quarry is more attractively priced . A lot of banks have been living off reduced credit losses , expense cuts and the yield curve , ' says Crutchfield . But a lot wo n't have the revenue growth to carry them forward . ' When the weak start to stumble , Crutchfield and McColl will start pouncing again . <p> PHOTO : First Union Chairman Edward Crutchfield Jr. : What we need is a good , cold , killing frost .
