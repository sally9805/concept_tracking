<p> John Kent Cooke streaks down the sideline with his double-breasted blazer flapping in the wind . <p> Suddenly , the Washington Redskins ' 56-year-old president cuts back and heads for the middle of the field . He stops abruptly at the 50-yard line , in the center of his new , $ 180 million football stadium . Ringed by 80,116 empty burgundy-and-gold seats , Cooke takes it all in and then looks up at the sky . <p> " I 'm so proud , " he says as his blue eyes mist up . " It took my dad nine years to build this , and now it 's done . The players and the fans are going to love it . Ca n't you hear the crowd cheering ? " <p> The noisy throngs wo n't storm the gates until Sunday afternoon , when the Redskins clash with the Arizona Cardinals . But even the prospect of another sellout ca n't erase the look of sadness in Cooke 's face . <p> After running the Redskins for nearly 20 years with his father , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dad , died last April at the age of 84 . And ever since the flamboyant football patriarch passed away , John Cooke has been left mourning a man who was also his beloved business partner , mentor and the only boss he 'd known . <p> Cooke also has been left wondering and worrying whether his father 's fourth  --  and last  --  wife will block his purchase of the Redskins from Jack Kent Cooke 's estate , valued at $ 500 million-$ 825 million . <p> " My dad really left his mark in sports , and the Redskins were his paramount entity , " says Cooke , " so I want to keep the team and pass it on to my two boys in his memory . " <p> Building a legacy <p> The Redskins ' new state-of-the-art stadium , in suburban Maryland just east of Washington , D.C. , will be a lasting shrine to Cooke 's father . <p> Last spring , with his dad 's health failing , Cooke turned down $ 10 million-$ 30 million from companies that wanted to put their logo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building for the man who conceived it . <p> " The last thing dad and I were supposed to do , " recalls Cooke , who has a bust of his father in his luxury box , " was choose the shade of burgundy for the stadium . " <p> Spectators wo n't be allowed to forget the old man , either . <p> At the end of every game , the stadium 's giant Jumbotron system will feature video images of Jack Kent Cooke thundering , " The best bloody fans on the face of the earth , the Washington Redskins fans ! " <p> Cooke also plans to make sure the signs on the highway leading to the football field are appropriately respectful and informative . Right now , they read " Stadium . " But that 's not good enough . <p> " I 've asked ( government officials ) to please say Jack Kent Cooke Stadium , " Cooke says . " After we 've spent $ 180 million , it 's the least they can do . " <p> To further honor his father , Cooke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dad in the stadium 's reception area . <p> Jack Kent Cooke was larger than life . <p> One of the richest men in North America , the moody millionaire could be alternately cranky and courtly , domineering and delightful . His lavish lifestyle was splashed across the gossip pages while his vast holdings in media , real estate and sports were dissected in the business section . <p> John Cooke works at the same antique desk as his father , but his operating style is much more reserved . <p> " When other people were in the room , dad was on stage , " Cooke says . " Sometimes , he embarrassed them , sometimes he motivated them better than Vince Lombardi . I do n't do it that way . I 'm blunt , forthright and I 'm not hesitant to speak my mind . " <p> Still , John Cooke always was there for his father . <p> " The word that comes to mind , " Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones says , " is loyalty . " <p> Adds Cincinnati Bengals President Mike Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on without John as he got older . He needed John to pick up the pieces . " <p> Unlike his father , who sought celebrity , John Cooke pursues privacy . <p> " I 've been in this business all my life and seen what attention can do to players , " he explains . " I 've seen my father hurt and his reputation occasionally damaged by the press . . . . Publicity is a terrible kiss . " <p> When Jack Kent Cooke attended Redskins games , his 60-seat personal box at RFK Stadium in Washington was packed with so many stars and headliners that the paparazzi ran out of film . <p> His son 's intimate 12-seater at the new stadium , on the other hand , will be occupied primarily by family and friends . <p> " The purpose of my life , it seems , is to gather a crowd , " Cooke says , " and I really do n't like a crowd . " <p> He also does n't like gaudy displays of wealth . <p> For a man worth more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . <p> His three-story brick town house in Georgetown , just down the hill from Katharine Graham , The Washington Post 's doyenne , is spare and simple , save for the occasional museum-quality masterpiece on the walls . <p> His office attire , scuffed suede loafers and cardigan sweaters , gives him the look of a relaxed country squire rather than a high-powered sports mogul . <p> And he pumps his own gas when filling up his sleek , silver Mercedes . <p> " I have many ballplayers and coaches making more money than I am , " says Cooke , who earns $ 250,000 ( adjusted annually for inflation ) each year as Redskins president . <p> Minding the money <p> To keep his franchise on firm financial footing , Cooke watches every penny . <p> When The Washington Post asked him to turn on the lights in his new stadium for a photograph , for example , he joked about the extra electricity cost . But he flicked the switch anyway . <p> " It 's not being a miser , " Cooke explains . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of wealthy people who are very careful with their money . They know how hard it is to make it and hold on to it . " <p> Cooke does n't milk his team like a cash cow . <p> " I 'm willing to put every cent back into the club , after I look after obligations , " he says . " I live a nice style . I do n't want anything else other than the Redskins and Jack Kent Cooke Stadium . " <p> Spending money to reward fans is a no-brainer for Cooke , who asked Tiffany to design an elegant china box for each well-heeled luxury-box holder at his new stadium . <p> " Our basic philosophy is like Wal-Mart 's , " Cooke says . " The customer is always right . You never take the customer for granted . " <p> You also never take the players for granted . <p> Sitting at a Redskins practice this week , Cooke observed the behemoths as they slashed and bashed their way across the field . He was impressed with the discipline and order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry Allen 's injured thumb . <p> " My father watched at least once a week , " Cooke says . " You see your team and let your team know that you 're interested . . . . We give them everything to win . " <p> And winning is everything . <p> Under Cooke 's day-to-day stewardship , the Redskins have won three Super Bowls , although they have n't made the playoffs since the 1992 season . <p> Off-the-field victories count , too . <p> Jack Kent Cooke Stadium is the second-largest football facility in the NFL , an aisle or two smaller than the Pontiac Silverdome , home of the Detroit Lions . But Cooke is n't satisfied . <p> " Over time , I can squeeze in a few hundred more seats , " he says . " I want to be the biggest and best . " <p> Ticket to prosperity <p> He 's already one of the shrewdest . <p> Redskins fans have leased approximately 80% of the 208 luxury boxes and 15,000 premium seats at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium for 5-10 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premium seats cost as much as $ 2,000 a year . <p> Backed by this guaranteed cash flow , plus other anticipated revenues from sources such as concessions and parking , Cooke was able to borrow about 86% of the $ 180 million needed to complete his stadium . NationsBank and Sumitomo Bank are leading the consortium that is financing the massive building . <p> " John is taking responsibility for the financial destiny of the Redskins , " the Cowboys ' Jones says . " He does n't rely on others . " <p> Cooke will have to depend on his lawyers as he unravels his father 's complex will and grapples with Marlene Ramallo Cooke , Jack Kent Cooke 's last wife . <p> Marlene Cooke , 44 , was cut out of the will 13 weeks before her husband 's death . Under a premarital agreement , she would be entitled to at least $ 5.25 million , but she contends that she deserves one-third of the estate . If she received a chunk that large , she could force the sale of the Redskins to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooke as he seeks to retain the team . But he is n't worried . <p> " I can do it , and I will do it , " he says . " I ca n't tell you how yet . " <p> Cooke has reason to be confident . If he needs funding to purchase the Redskins , investors would almost certainly line up to help him ; and if he needs protection , NFL owners would almost certainly stand up to defend him . <p> " John , " Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis says , " is not afraid .
