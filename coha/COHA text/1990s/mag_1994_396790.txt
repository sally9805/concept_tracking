FOR EXUBERANT aggressiveness , few executives can match Robert Levine , 38 , founder and CEO of Cabletron Systems . Or , as one his employees puts it , " Bob has a little P.T. Barnum in him . " Add the muscles of Sylvester Stallone , and you get an even clearer picture of the guy . Levine 's biceps bulge out of his custom-made short-sleeved shirt , thanks to daily workouts at the gym and practice on the dumbbells he keeps in his office . After listing the reasons why his competitors are losing ground against him , the chief executive snarls with Rambo-like intensity , " Let 's just wipe them out , and we 'll deal with life later . " Welcome to PC networking , one of the fastest-growing  --  and maybe the meanest  --  niches in computerdom , where the battles for market share are as bloody as the ones between the R &D; labs . Levine 's tough-guy approach has helped propel Cabletron to the top , but in their own way the executives who run the three other networking leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are just as a combative . Together these four outfits dominate the market for networking 's two key a products , hubs and routers , the devices that link PCs to networks and manage the flow of information between them . At stake is a market expected to grow nearly 40% this year , to $6 billion . Think networking is just something for info brats who subscribe to two or more Macintosh magazines ? Imagine your next out-of-town business trip . Once settled in your hotel room , you coolly switch on your laptop computer , dial in through your modem , and within minutes you have access to the heart of your company 's computer system . Databases , document files , E-mail messages all lie at your fingertips . A few years from now you 'll be able to add multimedia computing and videoconferencing to your laptop options . That 's the power of a network : linking far-flung employees to complex databases stored on central computers or mainframes . Networking is taking the U.S. by storm . More than 60% of the nearly 50 million PCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hospitals . By 1997 that share should hit 95% , forecasts International Data Corp. , and networks will also reach into many high schools and , farther out , your home . " That 's the beauty of this business , " says Wellfleet founder and President Paul Severino , 47 . " We 've been able to sell across the spectrum of customers . " As Severino knows , bigger markets mean bigger battles . Customers demand ever more service and support . Newcomers are fighting their way into the industry and tearing off their own profitable niches . By way of defense against these upstarts-and one another  --  today 's leaders are turning to mergers and alliances . SynOptics and Wellfleet are merging ; Cabletron and Cisco are tightening their already close product and marketing agreements . To understand the incredible run these four companies have had , and the challenges they face , think back to the early 1980s . If you had your own office computer back then , odds are it was a dumb terminal , hooked up to a mainframe somewhere else in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that , bringing about the PC revolution . In 1985 , just as those changes began to hit , Andrew K. Ludwick , 49 , quit his managerial job at Xerox and took his wife and three children , ages 8 years to 4 months , to Mountain View in northern California . With fellow Xerox alum Ronald Schmidt as his partner , Ludwick launched what was to become SynOptics . The first corporate headquarters was a construction trailer . The new product they aimed for was an improved version of the crude hubs  --  essentially big electronic connectors  --  that used coaxial cable to interconnect PCs . A year later , Schmidt , now 50 , and his research team had a breakthrough innovation . They designed a hub that linked PCs with cheap copper telephone wiring in place of expensive coaxial . The product lit up a new market almost overnight . SEVERAL OTHER companies , notably Cabletron , had been looking for a similar product , and SynOptics ' seizing of the early lead predictably set off a round of teeth gnashing . Then everybody turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use out of the hubs and manage their networks better . Endowed with this new software that enabled them to manage the information flow on the network , a new generation of hubs became known as " intelligent hubs "  --  and set off a surge in demand . By the end of the 1980s , SynOptics and Cabletron had made production of hubs and the software to run them their prime business . Both enjoyed annual revenue increases of as much as 80% through 1993 , when luck turned on one of these archrivals . Competition between Cabletron and SynOptics , who together hold nearly half the $3 billion worldwide hub market , has always been intense . The two companies are far apart in almost every way , including their choice of locations . While SynOptics calls Silicon Valley home , Cabletron nestles amid the wooded hills surrounding Rochester , New Hampshire . SynOptics designs everything in-house and subcontracts most of its manufacturing to nearby producers . Cabletron designs its hubs and makes most of them in its three U.S. plants or the one it owns in Limerick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different sales strategies , which is where the real battles of the future will take place . From the start , SynOptics has relied on some 350 independent vending companies . These so-called resellers employ several thousand people to sell the hubs . The true middlemen of computing , companies like Anixter , buy in quantity from SynOptics and line up their own customers . Today outside vendors handle almost 90% of SynOptics ' sales and have helped the company build the biggest customer base of any hub producer . IN CONTRAST , Cabletron employs its own sales force , numbering a seemingly modest 1,600 . A few are scattered overseas in such hot markets as Singapore , but most work in the U.S. , many of them making cold calls over the phone . CEO Bob Levine heads the company 's sales operations , and he likes to keep the aggression level high . The fact that he never served in the armed forces has n't prevented Levine from occasionally donning combat fatigues to set the tone at sales meetings . At one recent gathering , says an employee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company denies this particular tale . Levine , not surprisingly , is ready to take casualties . " If I 've got a guy who 's winning 50% of his deals , he 's gone . There 's no excuse for it , " he says . Salespeople are expected to travel on their own time , which means nights and weekends . Perhaps because of this , the sales force , about 40% of which is female , averages eight sales per ten calls , and turnover is low . Cabletron 's main new-customer target is any and every company that buys from SynOptics . One tactic Cabletron employs to lure them away is to offer discounts of up to 30% to SynOptics customers , provided they turn in their SynOptics equipment . Cabletron is n't the only hubmaker trying to snatch away its competitors ' customers , as both SynOptics and Cabletron have found out . 3Com , No. 3 in the industry , goes head to head with SynOptics in the market for low-end hubs , where price competition is intense  --  one of these hubs might go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based in Santa Clara , California , sells its hubs through many of the same vendors that sell SynOptics ' products . SynOptics is fighting back on several fronts . Among them : bigger cash incentives for successful vendors . Another fast-rising competitor eating its way up the food chain is newcomer Chipcom , of Southborough , Massachusetts . It is chomping away at the more profitable high end of the hub market , something that previously had belonged almost exclusively to SynOptics and Cabletron . Chipcom 's unique advantage is a joint product development and marketing agreement with IBM . The small company ( 1993 sales : $150 million ) makes hubs that carry Big Blue 's name and others that carry its own , and IBM 's huge sales force sells both , accounting for some 40% of Chipcom 's total sales . The biggest victim of this feeding frenzy appears to be SynOptics . For the first six months of this year , sales were flat at $333 million , and net income plunged 31% vs. 1993 , to $32 million . The weakest link in SynOptics ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels . SynOptics faced a major inventory glut in mid-1993 , caused largely by false signals the vendors sent back to headquarters . At first the vendors could n't get enough of the company 's new stripped-down hubs , known as stackables because of their compact size . Soon after factories increased production , the vendors backed off as customer demand fell . Stackables eventually proved to be a hot product and today contribute 35% of sales . But excess inventories , which ran close to double normal levels in the early months of 1994 , nearly did to SynOptics what Cabletron 's Levine only dreams of . At Wellfleet Communications , Paul Severino was also eyeing a less certain future . The company , which he founded in 1986 , had prospered by making routers , devices that connect entire networks to one another . In fiscal 1993 the company earned $61 million on sales of $384 million ; both figures more than double the 1992 results . But Severino recognized that Wellfleet , despite its incredible profits , did not have the technology to continue to flourish in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellfleet had started a joint venture , designing new products that will incorporate one of the newest networking technologies , a faster method of transferring data known as switching , with their products and technologies . Within a few months it seemed to both Severino and Ludwick that a merger was an even better way into the future . At first this prospect sent tremors through Wall Street . The deal was announced in early July , and by the end of the same day investors had pummeled the prices of both stocks , taking 21% off Wellfleet 's and 7% off SynOptics ' ' . In the weeks since , neither stock has recovered much of that lost value . While the companies refer to the deal as a " merger of equals , " Wellfleet , which had the higher market value , is effectively acquiring SynOptics in a stock swap . The new company , to be called Bay Networks , will have revenues of $1.1 billion . Ludwick will be CEO and Severino chairman . Severino is a rare bird among top executives in this industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his company after the Cape Cod town where Marconi transmitted his first transatlantic words by radio in 1903 . Nevertheless , Severino built a strong sales force at Wellfleet , relying on sales folk of his own who will help wean SynOptics from its risky dependence on outsiders . Ludwick calls the new mix " an all-channel strategy , " meaning it will give Bay Networks a broad reach to both small and large customers . MANAGING the new company will be especially tough because most employees  --  technical workers , salespeople , and the like  --  will remain where they are now , including 1,200 in California and 900 in Massachusetts . This will mean lots of coast-to-coast commuting for those who now must work closely . Jokes security analyst Paul Johnson of Robertson Stephens : " The one who is going to get rich from this deal is American Airlines . " One problem the merger wo n't solve is Cisco Systems of San Jose , the world 's largest maker of routers . With nearly 50% of the more than $2 billion market , Cisco has long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanford University engineers founded Cisco in 1984 as a part-time venture . When the company grew too big for them to manage , they stepped away and hired John Morgridge as CEO . Morgridge , now 61 , brought 30 years of computer selling know-how from Honeywell and other manufacturers , and soon imposed his competitive drive on the Cisco culture . Under Morgridge , Cisco has become the biggest and most profitable networking company in the world . It 's also known as a vicious competitor , and its sales force  --  half direct , half vendors  --  has a bruiser 's rep . All this makes the company a natural partner for Cabletron , and sure enough , the two have been cooperating in the marketplace . Now that their archenemies are merging , that cooperation has turned downright intimate . Sales teams from both companies are making joint presentations to customers , selling Cabletron hubs and Cisco routers . David Ayers , manager of Cabletron 's sales office in New York City , claims joint sales have " increased dramatically in the last three months , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gloats Morgridge : " It 's an opportunity for us because it creates instability for them . " In the long term , Cisco will likely be the biggest nemesis for Bay Networks because of its sales force and range of a products . Morgridge is widely expected to retire as CEO within the next year or two  --  all he 'll say is , " I do have retirement plans , my wife has plans , and they do n't always agree "  --  but a likely successor is already in place in the form of executive VP John Chambres , 45 . GLOBAL MARKETS are becoming increasingly important , and networkers are rushing to fight for share . The major hub and router manufacturers are stampeding to open sales offices around the world , but for now are doing most of their selling through local vendors because this is the fastest way to break into a new market . Cisco took perhaps the boldest step in July , selling a $40 million , 25% stake in its Tokyo subsidiary to 13 of Japan 's largest companies , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The joint venture will develop new networking products for the Japanese market . Other Asian countries are just beginning to adopt PC networking standards and promise more rich markets , as does South America . But the U.S. will continue to be the main focus of these networking competitors because that 's where the more immediate profits still lie . Far from being saturated , the U.S. market contains customers who are ready to buy ever more sophisticated technology . More companies are investing in enterprise-wide networks that connect branch offices with headquarters . Chase Manhattan , for example , has a network that links more than 100 offices around the world to its corporate data center in Brooklyn . This system , costing tens of millions , says the bank , uses hubs made by SynOptics and Chipcom and routers by Cisco . Toys " R " Us used products made by SynOptics and Cisco to connect 800 U.S. stores to its central data center in Paramus , New Jersey . Customers also plan to buy even newer technologies that will bring video , voice , and data to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hubs and routers that can handle such traffic . Part of the salesperson 's mission will be to show customers what kind of equipment they 'll need to handle their own future strategy . Perhaps most important in this kill-or-be-killed market , manufacturers must convince today 's customers that they will be around until tomorrow . " We 're looking for stability in the companies we buy from , " says Tom DeCanio , global network planning manager at Chase Manhattan . " I want to know they will be in this for the long haul . " So would they . <p>
