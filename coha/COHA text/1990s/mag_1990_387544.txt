SANTIAGO POSTCARD <p> The news in post-Pinochet Chile over the past few months has revolved around two kinds of amnesties . The first is the Amnesty Law of 1978 , in which the military junta pardoned itself for all crimes committed up to that year , thus legally erasing the vast majority of the human rights violations of Augusto Pinochet 's dictatorship . Three months ago the Supreme Court , whose justices were appointed during the Pinochet government , reaffirmed the law , adding that it also prohibited judicial investigations of pre-1978 crimes , even if the guilty were later pardoned . <p> The Amnesty Law lies at the center of the national debate in Chile : What to do about Pinochet and his men , who killed 2,000 Chileans , disappeared ' between 800 and 1,000 others , and tortured perhaps another 50,000 . The opposing slogans in the debate are Truth and Justice ' ( read : trials ) and Peace and Reconciliation ' ( read : forgetting ) . Working in favor of Truth and Justice is the fact that Chile has a lawyer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that folks should live by . This view has both reinforced and been reinforced by Chile 's 150-year history of democracy before Pinochet . On the other hand , there is the abiding power of Pinochet  --  the glaring exception to Chile 's respect for law  --  who now commands the army and has threatened God-knows-what if the Amnesty Law is overturned . And Chile 's lawyer 's soul , paradoxically , can work against justice as well . The Amnesty Law is a travesty of justice , but it is written down , and once a law is on the books , Chileans tend to follow it . <p> The other amnesty is Amnesty International , in the news for the first time since the founding of Amnesty 's Chilean Section in 1978 , but principally on the entertainment pages . Amnesty had invited Sting , Peter Gabriel , New Kids on the Block , Sinead O'Connor , Ruben Blades , Wynton Marsalis , and Jackson Browne to play , along with Spanish and Chilean groups , in a two-day concert to celebrate human rights worldwide called From Chile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was held on October 12 and 13 in Santiago 's National Stadium , Pinochet 's principal concentration camp in the weeks after the coup . More than 12,000 were detained in the stadium , most were tortured , and hundreds did not leave alive . <p> A few hours before the concert started I walked through the cold , concrete passageways in the bowels of the stadium to Amnesty 's office with Marcelo Montecino , Amnesty 's photographer . He paused in front of the adjoining door . I 've been here before , ' he said . Montecino had been held in that room following his arrest seventeen years and two weeks before , three weeks after Pinochet 's coup , after taking pictures of the relatives of prisoners and the soldiers outside the stadium . I spent my detention figuring out what kind of revenge I would take on my captors , ' he said . I have to admit , I never thought of this . ' <p> The concert had been two years in the planning . Amnesty 's 1988 Human Rights Now ! ' world tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Amnesty scheduled a concert in Mendoza , Argentina , and 15,000 Chileans crossed the border . Pinochet had lost his plebiscite just ten days before , paving the way to free elections , and we celebrated noisily , especially cheering Sting 's performance of They Dance Alone , ' which he wrote about the relatives of the Chilean disappeared who do a traditional folk dance without their missing partner . At the next Amnesty general meeting in Dublin , Santiago Larrain , the head of the Chile Section , pulled aside Jack Healey , head of the U.S. Section and world tour organizer . Let 's think about Chile , ' Larrain said . <p> The Chile Section had grown to be the largest in the Third World , with 2,000 members , despite the tribulations of life under Pinochet . I had been a member of the section for a few years and had just moved back to the United States when Larrain called me , in May 1990 , to work on the concert for the Chile Section . Working with a poor , small section alongside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on First World/Third World relations . The U.S. Section kept announcing more artists , imported lights , imported sound , imported TV equipment . It was the biggest and best concert in the history of Latin America . And the most expensive . <p> With the arrival of democracy and , more to the point , Sting , everyone was talking about Amnesty . Beginning in September , more than 500 letters a week poured into our shabby offices from Chileans who wanted to join . Larrain preached Amnesty 's gospel with countless formerly pro-Pinochet TV talk-show hosts . The Amnesty staff , never comfortable with seeing uniformed men in the doorway , got used to the fact that police were now visiting in search of free tickets . The only group we have n't heard from is the Retired Torturers Association , ' said my assistant , after turning away two Investigations detectives . <p> It was part of the Chileans ' shameless attempt to erase all previous connections to Pinochet . The champion , I was told , was Juan Guillermo Vivado , the anchorman for the state-run television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinochet turned over power to Patricio Aylwin , Vivado began his broadcast by intoning his thanks to Pinochet for saving Chile from communism . Then the station cut to the inauguration ceremony . An hour later Vivado was back on the now-democratic TVN , announcing an upcoming broadcast of a ceremony in the stadium , where thousands were tortured after the 1973 coup . ' <p> Still , the sudden conversions were better than the alternative . Leading the unrepentant is Pinochet , who has been stating that history will vindicate him and , even more strangely , hints that he might run for president in 1993 . The police too continue to demonstrate that they learned their manners under Pinochet . Investigations detectives are still torturing prisoners . One of Amnesty 's volunteers , arrested for no particular reason other than scruffiness , spent a day in jail watching police beat up several friends . We 're still smarting from what happened on March 11 , ' police told him . <p> During one set Jackson Browne dedicated a song to two journalists in military jail for slandering the armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government , lacking the votes for constitutional reform in congress , had not yet annulled . Neighboring Argentina , after thirteen military coups since 1930 , got into the habit of simply annulling laws new governments find inconvenient ; Argentina 's legal casualness was one reason there had been thirteen military coups . Chile is too serious to annul its laws . But that is also why Chilean journalists were in jail and Argentine journalists were not . <p> The same was true of the Amnesty Law . To open the legal doors to Argentina 's trials , President Ral Alfonsn annulled a self-amnesty passed by the generals . Aylwin will do no such thing , but in May he did set up a Chilean version of the Argentine Commission on Disappeared Persons , which had produced the report Nunca Ms '  --  Never Again . In the wrenching Truth/Justice vs . Peace/Reconciliation dispute , the commission tries to meet everyone halfway . It is called the Truth and Reconciliation Commission . ' The eight commissioners range from Gonzalo Vial , a Cabinet minister under Pinochet , to Jos Zalequett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out of Chile . The commissioners and their sixty staff members are still interviewing witnesses and relatives of victims and will produce a report in February addressing each case of death or disappearance . But because it is not a judicial body , the commission has no subpoena power and will not name the guilty . It will not deal with cases of torture . Its report will satisfy neither Pinochet 's side , many of whom believe the killings were justified , nor his opponents , who want to see the guilty punished . <p> So the relatives of the disappeared will have to be content with symbols . Sting closed the show at 3 a.m. on the second night with They Dance Alone . ' The rest of the artists and the Mothers of the Disappeared , wearing white and bearing photographs of their loved ones , joined him on stage . Then one of the mothers played a cueca folk dance on a single guitar as another woman danced . The 80,000 people in the crowd  --  some of whom had been there twelve hours  --  were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper . Then the last strains of the guitar died away , and the artists and mothers filed off the stage , the exorcism complete , the ghosts of the National Stadium able to rest in peace , if not in Truth and Justice . <p> By Tina Rosenberg <p> <p> TINA ROSENBERG is a visiting fellow at the Overseas Development Council .
