<p> ' MAKING UP FOR PAST MISTAKES IN HAITI ' <p> Editor  --  Americans shocked by the possibility of an invasion of Haiti need to realize why we are there . The fact of the matter is Raoul Cedras and several of his cohorts were once supported and trained by the U.S. Once again a president is willing to jeopardize the lives of U.S. troops in order to correct past policy mistakes . <p> It seems that providing for the common defense has come to include defense of poor decision- making . Senators were calling for more support for Sadaam Hussein up until he crossed the Kuwaiti border . Noriega was convenient until he refused to participate in our little Contra war . When will our Congress and the president realize that our troops are n't as expendable as a bottle of white-out ? <p> JOHN D. COUCH <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> AMERICA FIRST <p> Editor  --  Grenada , Panama , Iraq , Somalia , Haiti . . . but not Bosnia . Is it that we only shoot at people of color ? Is Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care and not for Haiti . We need to deal with our own problems and not try to be the cops of the world . <p> ALBERT LANNON <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> KOREAN ' EXTORTION ' <p> Editor  --  I was appalled to read that North Korea is selling purported human remains of our Korean War dead and that our government is buying these remains . <p> As an Army chaplain who served in Korea during the war , I am especially outraged that our government is yielding to this kind of cruel and inhuman extortion . That " hard bargaining " is continuing over additional remains serves further to dishonor the memory of our Korean War dead . How demeaning ! How humiliating ! <p> H. DAVID TEITELBAUM <p> Temple Beth Jacob <p> Redwood City <p> . <p> ' MOTOR-VOTER ' IS THE LAW <p> Editor  --  Richard S. Shawkey says in his letter of September 14 that his " gut " tells him that the federal " Motor-Voter " law is unconstitutional . <p> He should check the Constitution , not his stomach . Article I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time by law make or alter " any election law dealing with how Congress is elected . The federal " Motor-Voter " law only covers federal elections ; states are free to have a separate voter registration list for state elections which does n't include " Motor-Voter " registrants . <p> RICHARD WINGER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> HEROES AND VILLAINS <p> Editor  --  The Chronicle 's special report on the Shasta River , published August 22 , appeared designed to call attention to the problems faced by the river 's salmon run and to spur action toward a solution . Though it may have achieved the former goal , it certainly has discouraged the latter . <p> The report characterized the Shasta River situation as a story of heroes and villains  --  in this case , heroic fishery advocates standing up for the salmon in the face of obstinacy , and even threats of bodily harm , from villainous cattle ranchers . <p> Those same ranchers receive the clear blame in the report for the decline in the salmon fishery . They are the ones , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hay . They are the ones who stripped trees from the river 's banks to allow their cattle to roam unchecked along the river , which now faces pollution from cattle manure . <p> Never mind that , as the report says , " Ranchers and fish advocates cite a variety of factors for the salmon 's decline , including excessive river and ocean fishing and the ongoing drought . " These theories are brushed off as being obviously self- serving . <p> Unfortunately , the term " cynically torpedoed " also may now apply to the efforts of Shasta Valley ranchers working to aid the salmon fishery . Those ranchers created the area 's Coordinated Resources Management and Planning program ; despite assertions in The Chronicle report , environmentalists have not been directly involved in the CRMP process . <p> Those ranchers want to help restoration efforts for anadromous fish while maintaining viable agricultural use of land along the Shasta River . They have been trying to convince other ranchers to join the effort , but they now feel their work has been undermined by The Chronicle report . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with biologists and environmentalists , only to have a big- city reporter parachute in , label ranchers " the primary reason for the salmon 's decline , " and leave again . <p> It 's also disheartening to realize that , in his rush to blame agriculture for all the problems facing the Shasta River , your reporter may have undercut those who might eventually be the real heroes the river needs : people of good will who want to solve problems through cooperation , not government edict . <p> BOB L. VICE , president <p> California Farm <p> Bureau Federation <p> Sacramento <p> . <p> WORKING TOGETHER <p> Editor  --  Glen Martin 's reporting on the salmon situation in Shasta River ( " Salmon Lose Fight for Shasta River , " August 22 ) provides another example of the need for a collaborative effort to save threatened species throughout California . Confrontations , ultimatums and legal skirmishes wo n't restore the chinook salmon runs in Shasta River as rapidly as will working together . <p> This is precisely why the Department of Fish and Game supports the Coordinated Resources Management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a practical effort to bring local interest groups together in a volun tary fish habitat restoration program . The department is committed to restoring the salmon fishery and conserving the biological diversity of the region . We also appreciate the property rights concerns of landowners . The problems of the entire Shasta River watershed must be addressed to save the salmon for future generations . <p> As Martin correctly noted , the CRMP process has already borne several dividends for the river . In general , we 've made more progress through the CRMP in the past year than during the previous 50 . <p> We look forward to more cooperative work and success in the future . <p> BOYD GIBBONS , director <p> Department of Fish and Game <p> Sacramento <p> . <p> TRIM FAT AND WASTE <p> Editor  --  Giving City Hall more money by increasing the property transfer tax is not the answer to San Francisco 's budget mess ( Editorial , September 9 ) . <p> The answer is eliminating the fat and waste that consume millions of the city 's dollars each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiscal Advisory Committee , Civil Grand Jury , Board of Supervisors ' budget analyst , local press and others . <p> The Board of Supervisors owes it to all San Franciscans to say " no " to new taxes until the city budget is fat free . Only then will we be on the path to solving San Francisco 's fiscal problems . <p> LEE KORINS , chairman <p> Governmental Goals Committee <p> Committee on JOBS <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> ' DRESS LIKE A WOMAN ' <p> Editor  --  A barrage of tartan mini-skirts , fluff-lined stiletto heels and thigh-high stockings , which can only hope to stay up long enough for a photograph to be taken . These are the images that accompanied the headline , " It 's Time to Dress Like a Woman Again , " in the September 6 fall fashion spread . Sigh . It 's time to dress like a woman . . . again ? What a drag . <p> Well , I beg to differ . I can assure you that it is not time to dress like a woman again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many friends and relatives who will back me up on this one ) and I do not plan on looking like a schoolgirl/hooker come autumn . <p> Another quote : " Sure , stilettos are uncomfortable . But when was the last time anyone complimented you on how beautiful your feet look in Birkenstocks ? " <p> But of course ! I 'd almost forgotten that my ultimate goal as a woman was to be complimented on how well my feet are looking . Corns and bad posture be damned ! I 'll also be giving up a higher education and a challenging career because these things sometimes require being able to walk . I wo n't be able to do a lot of walking , given my new devotion to stiletto heels . <p> My point is this . I 'm all for being feminine . It 's the definition of femininity served up by male fashion designers that I do n't buy . <p> My definition of femininity ( and I feel I 've a right to create one , being that I 'm actually female ) is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since I 'm already a woman and have proudly been so for quite some time , I do n't need to " dress like a woman " or a male fashion designer 's version of a woman , in order to feel feminine . <p> When will fashion designers start to make clothing according to what women want , instead of what they want women to be ? <p> JASMINE FOX <p> Miranda ( Humboldt County )
