Section : HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE . REPORT . Your policy may not provide the coverage you thought Here 's how to protect yourself <p> Louise and William King 's house was spared when Hurricane Andrew , the killer storm that left more than 180,000 people homeless , swept through Florida in 1992 . But not long after the storm 's fury passed , the North Miami Beach couple realized that they were hurricane victims , too . <p> Though the Kings had never filed a claim in the 25 years they lived in their home , their insurer , Metropolitan Property &; Casualty , dropped their coverage . Forced into a state-run pool that insures people who can not purchase a commercial homeowners policy , they now pay $1,257 a year - three times their previous premium - for far less protection . <p> Today , millions of consumers in regions far from the wrath of Andrew are still feeling its aftermath . Over the past decade , a string of ruinously expensive natural disasters have saddled property and casualty companies with record losses . As a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policyholders they do n't want to insure . <p> This report will help you understand the new rules for buying the right protection . " Valuing your home , " below , will help you compute what it would cost to rebuild your home in the event of a catastrophe - the real reason you need a homeowners policy . In " Getting help , state by state " in the Ratings , you 'll find a list comparing the claims service of 25 major insurers , as judged by respondents to our most recent Annual Questionnaire , and where you can get insurance information in all 50 states . Finally , to guide you in your shopping , the " What price protection ? " tables in the Ratings compare premiums charged by seven of the largest insurers in seven big states . It 's your problem now <p> For years , insurers have been digging themselves into a hole , and now they 're looking to consumers to pull them out . As they competed for market share in the 1980s , companies wooed clients with unrealistically low premiums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when the natural disasters of the 1990s struck , the insurers had to make good on these gold-plated promises . <p> As a result , those unlimited guarantees are giving way to far more restrictive coverage terms . Market leaders State Farm , Allstate , and Farmers , which together insure more than 40 percent of American homes , have re-designed their coverage to cap their liabilities . State Farm , for example , now sells a new single-family-home policy in 38 states that limits replacement-cost coverage to 120 percent of the insured value of the dwelling . At Allstate and Farmers , the new caps are 150 percent and 125 percent , respectively , in many states . Since other insurers are expected to follow the leaders , the days of unlimited replacement-cost coverage may be over . <p> This trend means that you could face a big problem if your home is destroyed . Were you to insure your home with State Farm for $100,000 , for example , you 'd be covered up to a maximum of $120,000 . But should you end up needing $130,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole for that extra $10,000 - a situation you could face in the wake of a major fire or storm that drives up building costs in your community . New risks , new rules <p> Homeowners insurance is often purchased in haste and needed only when a rare calamity strikes . It 's easy to overpay if you insure for the full market value of your home , even though it might not cost nearly that much to rebuild . It 's also common to depend on an insurance agent to tell you the appropriate level of coverage . But that , too , could be a costly mistake , as nearly 1 million California clients of Allstate found out . In a preliminary settlement of a class-action suit alleging that customers had been overcharged , Allstate agreed to reimburse homeowners for as much as $120 million in excess premiums . Allstate 's estimates , the plaintiffs argued , systematically overvalued policyholders ' properties , charging for extra rooms or amenities the homes did not have . <p> Underinsuring could be a much bigger mistake . If your home were destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to one industry estimate , 70 percent of American homes are underinsured , by an average of 35 percent . What coverage do you need ? <p> You 'll have to determine as precisely as possible the true value of your house and its contents . A custom-home builder will know local construction costs , but it may be difficult to find one willing to take the time to prepare a careful estimate . Most professional appraisers are better able to judge a home 's market value than what it would cost to rebuild . However , you can reasonably arrive at an approximate replacement cost on your own by taking some basic measurements of your home and doing a bit of homework on local building costs . " Valuing your home , " below , will guide you through the steps . <p> You 'll also need to prepare an inventory of your home 's contents . The best way to document what you own is to take a camcorder or a still camera from room to room , noting when you bought each item and how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information in a bank safe-deposit box . The whole job will take you about one day . Shopping for a policy <p> You 'll find out how well the insurer you choose will back up its promises only when you can least afford to have doubts - after you 've filed a claim . Here are questions you should have answered before you buy a new policy or renew your current one : <p> How does the insurer rate in customer satisfaction ? Because it 's rare for a homeowner to suffer a total loss , your best gauge of how well an insurance company is apt to resolve a big claim may be what policyholders think of its handling of smaller claims - the broken tree limb that crushes the garage roof , for example . Of the 214,361 Consumer Reports subscribers who responded to our 1997 Annual Questionnaire , 24,841 filed for losses averaging $1,500 . <p> As the Ratings show , all of the companies we asked respondents to evaluate performed well . Satisfaction scores ranged from 75 to the low 90s , indicating generally that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying a policy from an insurer that 's not on our list , contact your state department of insurance , listed in the Ratings . You may be able to find out whether an insurer you 're considering has a history of consumer complaints . <p> One of the biggest sources of frustration reported by our survey respondents was the failure of many of their insurers to keep them fully informed on such matters as changing policy features and opportunities to save money . Only Amica , USAA , and USAA Casualty excelled in these key areas of customer service . <p> What special features or limitations does the policy have ? Find out whether the policy will cap your recovery if you buy replacement-cost coverage . Some policies are also more generous in the coverage they extend if you have to relocate to temporary housing following a loss . Most companies say they 'll pay up to 20 percent of the insured value of the home ; others offer reimbursement of damage-related living expenses for a year or more after the loss . <p> Is the underwriter financially sound ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more of the nation 's five insurance-rating services - A.M. Best , Duff &; Phelps , Moody 's Investor Services , Standard &; Poor 's , or Weiss Ratings - to determine that the company issuing it is strong enough to withstand a major loss . You can get that information from an insurance agent or at a public library . Each of the underwriters listed in the Ratings received at least an A- , or excellent , rating from A.M. Best . <p> What discounts can you get ? You may be able to lower your premium by insuring your home with the same company that insures your automobile . Most insurers also provide discounts to customers whose homes are equipped with a sprinkler system or a monitored alarm , and some have better rates for nonsmokers and for policy-holders over age 50 . If you qualify , you can cut your annual homeowners-insurance bill by as much as 35 percent . But your agent may not volunteer this information , so be prepared to ask . Recommendations <p> A standard policy ( called an HO-3 policy , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners of single-family homes . It will protect your home and contents against damage caused by fire , lightning , ice and snow , vandalism and theft , and ( in most states ) windstorms and hail , among other named perils . It will also cover extra living expenses if your family is displaced ; reconstruction of garages and other unattached structures ; and limited medical coverage for visitors injured on your property . Before you buy , here are the key considerations : <p> Get complete coverage . Insure your home for 100 percent of its reconstruction cost . If you insure for less than 80 percent of that value , you will receive only partial reimbursement to rebuild after a loss that damages just a part of your home . <p> A policy that offers unlimited replacement-cost coverage is the best choice . One that caps the insured value of your property may be sufficient only if you 've properly calculated the cost to rebuild . Ask , too , for an inflation-guard option that annually raises your coverage to keep pace with increases in local building costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home improvements you make . <p> Protect your personal belongings . When you insure your home at 100 percent of its replacement cost , your carrier will typically cover your possessions for 70 percent or 75 percent of the value of the structure . That may be sufficient , but even if you 've purchased **27;28;TOOLONG coverage for your home , ask specifically for replacement-cost coverage for its contents . Without it , you 'll receive only the depreciated value of anything damaged or stolen . Take precautions , too , to insure any valuables and collectibles with a special endorsement . A typical policy will cover jewelry , furs , and watches for a combined maximum of $1,000 , silverware for $2,500 , and small boats for $1,000 . <p> Cover your assets . A homeowners policy also provides liability protection against injury or damage done to others while on your property . Your policy will pay legal bills if you 're sued for damage caused by members of your household , including your pets . Dog bites alone account for some $250 million in total claims each year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we suggest that you increase the amount to $250,000 or $300,000 . The added protection is n't costly . In Pennsylvania , for example , that upgrade would cost just $12 with Erie Insurance Exchange . If your total assets are substantial , consider getting a separate umbrella policy . For an annual premium of between $200 and $300 , you can extend liability limits on both your home-owners and auto policies to $1 million . <p> Do n't overinsure for small losses . Our survey respondents most commonly told us they had set the deductible on their policy at $250 . That 's probably too low . With a typical policy , you can save 12 percent annually on your premium by raising your deductible from $250 to $500 - and twice as much by increasing it to $1,000 . Even if you end up paying out-of-pocket costs on a single claim , you 'll probably end up saving money over time , since the average homeowner files a claim only once every ten years or so . In any event , it 's wise not to file for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to use the pretext of repeated claims as grounds to cancel your policy . <p> Consider a building-code endorsement . If you own an older home , you may want this coverage . Typically called an ordinance-and-law endorsement , it will pay a proportion of the insured value of your dwelling - often 10 percent - to upgrade wiring , plumbing , or other structural features required to bring your home into compliance with changes in local building codes if damage forces you to rebuild . Building-code protection is included in all Florida policies and is offered by some companies in other parts of the U.S. Purchased as extra protection , it will add anywhere from 2 percent to 15 percent to the cost of your basic premium . <p> Mind your home business . Your basic policy wo n't cover any business property or office equipment in your home valued at more than $2,500 . You may be able to buy an endorsement that increases the limits on your regular homeowners coverage , for less than $200 , or a policy specially designed for home businesses , starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your regular homeowners policy wo n't insure for losses resulting from mud-slides or flooding . For that you 'll need federal flood insurance , sold through most insurance companies and administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency . At a premium averaging $329 for around $100,000 of coverage , it 's well worth the money for anyone living in a vulnerable area . VALUING YOUR HOME <p> Before you shop for a policy , use this worksheet to estimate what it would cost to rebuild your home in its entirety . Then have your insurance agent corroborate your calculations and review other features that will affect the price you pay for the policy you buy . <p> <p> Step 1 <p> Enter the cost per square foot of building a custom home in your community . <p> $fill in the blank <p> <p> Call at least two local builders or real-estate agents .

Multiply that figure by the number of floors of living space , including the basement .

Increasingly , the stringency of local building codes has an impact on rates .

This information was collected from the biggest insurers in California , Florida , Illinois , New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania , and Texas . For each state , we obtained quotes from seven top insurers for two types of homes - one of woodframe construction , the other of masonry .

Will an agent offer them the same insurance ? Fair-housing advocates , who have been putting this question to the test across the U.S. , say that too often the answer is no . Minority homeowners , they 've found , will be offered inferior coverage - if they 're offered any at all . <p> The consequences of redlining - the practice of turning away insurance applicants based on a community 's racial or ethnic composition - can be devastating . " The lack of insurance has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy director of the National Fair Housing Alliance ( NFHA ) . <p> Insurers deny that they engage in discrimination . But complaints filed over the fast five years with the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) by the NFHA and other housing advocates tell a different story . <p> The NFHA conducted undercover investigations in nine U.S. cities over a three-year period in the early 1990s . The alliance had black , Latino , and white " testers " posing as insurance buyers contact the same insurance agent in a given community and ask to purchase insurance for comparable homes . The results : Between 50 percent and 80 percent of the time , the minority applicant was denied coverage or offered inferior protection . Similar findings were decisive in a $100 million judgment against Nationwide Insurance awarded by a Richmond , Va. , jury last October . Housing advocates also have pending administrative complaints or lawsuits againts Liberty Mutual , Prudential , and Travelers . <p> The neighborhood-blighting effects of redlining can be mitigated when communities and insurance companies work together .

A California regulation , for instance , requires insurers to report the race and ethnicity of policy applicants , but the state 's insurance commissioner has been slow to release the findings . Civil rights and consumer groups , including Consumers Union , have pressed for full disclosure , which would shed light on discriminatory practices . A lack of disclosure helps perpetuate mistrust - and perhaps cloaks an injustice . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : House rules . These nearly identical homes are in similar neighborhoods in Richmond , Va .
