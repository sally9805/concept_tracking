" These parts are much given to implacable quarrels and domestic feuds . I leave it to others to tell of the inhuman crimes committed in our own times : marriages most cruelly brought about , inflicted rather than contracted , only to be cut short by savage acts of family bloodshed .... <p> - Gerald of Wales , 1191 <p> Wall Walk <p> CLARE HAD TO WALK THE walls just to breathe . Looking out at morning mist on hostile Welsh hills , she imagined the smell of death hung over the castle . Clinging to cold stone . Sunk into the straw and rushes strewn on the stone floors . Her stepfather was not yet dead , merely dying , but the smell was already there . As real to Clare as the white mist on the green hills . As real as Strongbow 's ghost . <p> Unloving and aloof , her stepfather had long been physically deaf , and utterly blind to her wants and needs . But it shook her to see him lying stricken and speechless , no longer anchoring her world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put sharp pebbles in his shoes . When he fell sick , the castle women found that he secretly wore a hair undershirt alive with vermin , knotted so tightly to his waist that the cords dug at his flesh . <p> If death came for someone so pious and humble , how could anyone be safe ? <p> Clare had sat vigil in the sick chamber half the night , lulled by women 's prayers and her stepfather 's labored breath . At dawn she got up to walk the walls . No one told her no , or tried to stop her . It felt strange to be suddenly beyond adult control . To be the heiress , and at thirteen the lady of the castle . <p> " Good morrow , little whore . " <p> Clare looked up to see her stepbrother , looming large in the morning light , dressed in his favorite fur-lined tunic and drawers . Edmund had always been bigger than she . Big , blond , and hateful . He hated her ever since their parents married , and he realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It grated that " this tiny slut , this little worthless creature " could keep him from being lord of Caeradar . <p> She turned back toward the hills , staring out over Ebbw Vale , muttering a spell that would send Edmund over the seas to be a harem slave among the Turks . <p> He took her chin between his thumb and finger , twisting her head around , forcing her to face him . " I said , Good morrow , bastard sister . " <p> The magic had not worked . Edmund had an evil strength that foiled even her best spells . He had always been stronger , and able to hurt her . And he gloried in that strength and ability . She might be her mother 's heiress - and the family pet-but he could always cause her pain , could casually make her cry . <p> " Good morrow , " she muttered , her chin still held painfully in his grip . As they had gotten older , his desire to hurt her had taken more sinister forms . When she was seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mud , then ground his bootheel down on her hand , breaking her finger . But that had been child 's play . Now Clare truly feared him , knowing he meant to break not only her body , but her spirit as well . <p> " That 's better , little bastard . " Besides his strength , Edmund liked to hold his legitimacy over her . She might be her mother 's heiress , but he was born in wedlock . It made robbing her a moral duty . <p> He gave her face a gleeful inspection . " I do n't know what I will do when Father is dead . Put you in a nunnery perhaps , like your crazy mother . Or maybe marry you to the Welsh dog-boy . " He turned her head , forcing her to look into the lower bailey , where Rory was exercising the long loping Welsh greyhounds . <p> Unable to move her head , she stared at Rory , a red-haired , green-eyed boy about Edmund 's age . Remarkably clean-looking , considering he was Welsh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good dancer . His sister Gwen was her serving girl . <p> Rory must have heard , since he looked up . Somehow he knew they were talking about him , though he did not even speak English , much less Norman-French . But like all Welsh he had that animal knack for knowing without speech . He must not have liked being talked about , because he turned and walked away , taking the hounds with him . <p> Edmund jerked her head back to face him . " Or perhaps I will just wall you up in some convenient tower , to die of thirst and madness amid your own filth . " She saw that idea had a special appeal . <p> " But whatever I do , we will first have a night to remember . You have that to look forward to . " He let his hand drop , turned and walked away , having more important things to do than torment her . He too was scared . Clare could tell . Insulting the Welsh and bullying her were Edmund 's two main ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring back out over the hayfield dotted with the burnt remains of St. John 's Eve bonfires , looking down on fish hawks soaring over the white torrent of the Ebbw . Edmund only had power over her if she let him . Before giving in she would climb to the highest part of the keep and hurl herself from the battlements . Suicide might be a mortal sin-but that was between her and God . It would be her doing . Her decision . <p> But throwing herself off the keep would do her small good , no matter how much it might disappoint Edmund . She desperately needed a more promising plan , one not requiring her gory demise . <p> Her fingers dug at cold hard stone . Beyond the Ebbw , green Welsh hills rose and fell , a great timbered sea receding into misty distance . Within the walls people walked lightly . The lord of Caeradar lay dying , leaving everyone unsure of their station . But beyond the walls things were no better . All England was in an uncertain state . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjust , but often not easy to understand - had let the infidel Saladin take Holy Jerusalem . Kings and emperors had gone off on Crusade , along with hordes of lesser folk . Good King Richard Lionheart went with them , leaving behind a hated regent and a treacherous brother who were happily at each other 's throats . <p> No one could know what was coming . Not she . Not Edmund . Not even Prince John , the brother to King Richard . Only the wild Welsh in the surrounding hills knew what to make of it . They had already risen up in revolt . <p> Witch 's Night <p> CLARE KNELT in the sick chamber , eyes closed , hands clasped , smelling burnt wax , frankincense , and the deathly sweet odor of disease . She could hear the women at their prayers , whispering words over and over again . Her own prayers were varied , but heartfelt . She begged for her stepfather 's life . Not just because he had been pious and decent-but out of horror at what Edmund would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were real and which were made just to terrify her . At the absolute best he would brutalize her - in ways he was not allowed to so long as his father lived . Afterward , if she was lucky , he would lock her up in a nunnery to keep her from her inheritance . <p> Clare knew something of a nun 's life from visits to her mother . They had shaved heads and slept on board beds , beneath itchy hair blankets . Bells woke them at Lauds , in the darkest hour of morning . They put on black habits - the same ones they would be buried in - and went to the chapel to pray , stretched out on the cold stones in total submission to Christ , their lord and husband . Then they filed back to their cells for an hour of rest before Prime . Breakfast was bread and water . Dinner not much better . They never knew a man 's love , never had children , never enjoyed a free day to do as they pleased . A bleak life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seem like heaven . <p> The Matins bell rang . Clare crossed herself and rose . Women muttering prayers watched her leave . Last spring , she had turned thirteen , and been the castle pet , indulged and doted on by everyone save Edmund . Now her least action had grave meaning . For good or ill , Caeradar 's future resided in her body . <p> She mounted the spiral stairs leading to the top floor of the keep . The heart of Caeradar was the castle 's great rectangular Norman keep . Sitting atop a limestone ridge above the river Ebbw , the four-story keep dominated the landscape , dwarfing the little Welsh round towers and hill forts , seeming to have been raised by titans . Her stepfather 's sickroom was adjacent to the chapel . Winding stairs led to an anteroom directly above that had been her mother 's bedroom , and now belonged to Clare . <p> She closed and barred the door behind her . This room , the sickroom , and the chapel had become her sanctuary - now that the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lamp black . Curtains covered the arrow slits spaced around three sides of the bedchamber . The stone window seats beneath them were three feet tall , built for a race of giants . Two women waited in her bedchamber , one young , one old - aside from hermits and prisoners , Clare 's world had no concept of privacy . Gwen , her Welsh serving girl , slept on the floor at the foot of the canopy bed . Nuala , her big white-haired Irish nurse , sat on an oak chest , head nodding , a shawl around her shoulders . She looked up as the door closed . <p> " Eat , " Nuala ordered . She had brought hare-and-wine collops and honey cakes up from the kitchen . " Then wake the girl . " Selecting a honey cake , Clare sat obediently at the older woman 's feet . She might be the lady of the castle , but Nuala would always be her nurse-who had suckled her , spanked her , and cared for her , crooning her to sleep and sharing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the sickroom below . <p> " He sinks fast , " Clare admitted . She had every reason to wish her stepfather well , but she could not lie to Nuala . <p> " Mother Mary gives and the Mother Mary takes , " Nuala intoned . " Now eat your collops . " <p> Clare obeyed , though she never liked eating rabbits - or anything cute . Once she had freed the castle 's entire stock of hares , herding them out the upper bailey 's high postern , amazing and frightening the Welsh , who had never seen rabbits before . Herd girls and hay cutters fled for the hills , pursued by frisking hares . But the way Nuala cooked them , with wine , onions , and oatmeal , gave them an agreeable nutty taste . <p> She washed her collops down with wine , then looked toward the bed . " Shall I wake her ? " <p> Nuala nodded . Clare went over and shook the girl lying at the foot of her bed , saying , " Wake up , Gwen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gwen sat up , red-haired , freckle-faced , half-asleep , and mumbling in Welsh , " O ? Arglwyddes Caer ? " Clare smiled , " Bore da . " Meaning , " Good morning . " She had taken in Gaelic with Nuala 's milk , and Gwen had taught her Welsh . She spoke both languages better than she spoke English , the language of soldiers and serfs . Norman-French was her " native " speech , though she had never been to France , except in spirit . And she knew enough Latin to talk to God in his own tongue . In fact she found many similarities between Welsh and Latin . Words like " tripod " and " tribedd . " Or " canis " and " ci . " Proof that the Welsh were descended from the Trojan heroes who founded Rome . <p> The serving girl rubbed her eyes and yawned . " Ydyn ni'n mynd ? " <p> Clare nodded . " Ydyn ni'n mynd . " We are going . Locals called Clare " Arglwyddes Caer o Caeradar . " Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " camp . " Or " home . " Caeradar meant , " Camp of the birds . " Like Caerleon meant " Camp of the Legions . " <p> Gwen and her brother the dog-boy were the last hostages left loose in the castle . Last summer her people had overrun two castles , Laugharne and Llanstephen , three easy days to the east . Now the rising had spread to Ebbw Vale , condemning Gwen to death or disfigurement . The other locals not locked in the keep basement had all gone over the walls , or out the latrine postern , as soon as the hill tribes had risen - taking flitches of bacon , tableware and tapestries , whatever they could lay hands on in lieu of wages . Theft was the Welsh way of saying thanks . <p> Clare looked over at Nuala . " We 're ready . Let 's go . I want to see Mother . " <p> Her nurse had already blown out the lamps , leaving a single taper burning in the middle of the floor . Observing a holy silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled her French-cut blouse over her head . It was natural and comforting for Clare to see her nurse naked . Nuala was incredibly strong , topping thirteen stone , with wide hips , broad knotted shoulders , and arms like a troll . She had earth-magic in her blood . Not just a lady 's nurse , Nuala was a blacksmith , boatwright , and harper - who shoed her own horses , built her own boats , and composed her own verse . Born in the first half of the century , she could still out-row men and run down mares , and remained a fearsome wrestler , having beaten the garrison sergeant-at-arms two falls in three . <p> Nuala was a force of nature . Clare was always in awe of her , and always depended on her . More so than on her own mother , who had a retiring and contemplative temperament . If Nuala said they must walk across the sea to Spain , or fly naked to the Moon , Clare would not have doubted they could do it . <p> Clare took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemise underneath . Gwen removed her homespun cloak and dress , singing softly to herself as she stripped . She had been included to complete the coven , and as hostage she had little choice . Nuala was not someone you said " no " to . <p> They knelt facing each other , forming a naked triangle around the lighted candle . Nuala smeared honey in the girls ' mouths , and they linked hands . Tall shadows danced about the chamber . The Matins bell had rung , making it past midnight on Friday , Witch 's Night . <p> Nuala invoked Mary - Virgin , All Mother , and Death Angel - the female trinity . Then she began an ancient Irish chant , one she used to croon to Clare in her cradle , as soft and compelling as the rolling sea . Flickering candlelight , the rising and falling rhythm , the taste of honey , all drew Clare in . Cares fell away . Her eyes closed . She let herself drift away on Nuala 's song . The world around her disappeared . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide . Maid Marian . Mary as maiden , young and blonde , as ripe and wild as the greenwood . Dressed in a forest-colored tunic and hose , she had a huntsman 's cap and horn , and carried a bow . The mannish garb showed she defied men 's laws and assumed their prerogatives , unfettered by dresses and convention . Her bow symbolized her power over life and death . Her cap and horn meant she hunted for souls . <p> She asked , " Why have you come , dear daughter ? " <p> " I have come to see my mother , " Clare whispered back . <p> " And so you have , " Marian spun about and spread her arms . <p> " My Earthly mother , " Clare explained . <p> Maid Marian smiled , showing sly dimples , looking as merry and roguish as the outlaws who worshipped her . " I knew that . " <p> In a twinkling Clare found herself standing in a narrow stone cell furnished with a plain oak chair and table . A woman slept on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of the Virgin on the wall , lighted by wax candles . Clare knew at once she was at Fontevrault Abbey on the banks of the Vienne , near Chion . The woman sleeping on the bed was her mother . <p> Marian admired her likeness on the wall , while Clare stared down at her sleeping mother , envious of her serenity and shining chestnut hair . She always felt plain compared to her mother . Mother had been the great lady , mistress to an earl , a damsel for poets to sing of . Clare was the little cast-off bastard , an inconvenience to everyone . <p> She also envied her mother 's security , sleeping peacefully in this tight stone cell . Fontevrault was an utterly amazing place in a world otherwise ruled by men . Here the monks and lay brothers were completely subject to the Abbess , who by law had to be a widowed nun - both chaste and maternal , and accustomed to managing a household . Under women 's rule Fontevrault had become a refuge for battered wives , poor widows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concubines , and surplus princesses who could not find suitable marriages . <p> Mother was none of these . Her husband , now dying , had been hopelessly devoted to her . She was neither battered , nor sick , nor outcast . She was not a nun , nor even a lay sister . But she was beautiful , charmingly willful , and adept at landing on her feet . She had found the one place in Christendom where no man 's hand could reach her . Clare called out , " Mother . " The sleeping form stirred . Clare tried again . " Mother . " <p> Her mother sat up , looking astonished , muttering , " Holy Mary ! " Marian smiled and curtsied . <p> Brushing shining brown hair out of her eyes , her mother stared at the two young women - one naked , the other dressed up like Robin Hood . " Clare , is that you ? " <p> " It is me , mother . " <p> " Am I dreaming ? " She looked about for something to prick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming . " <p> Her mother sat back . " Then it must be Friday . " <p> " Yes , it 's Friday . You ought to have been expecting me . " This was not Clare 's first witch 's flight to Fontevrault . <p> Solemnly her mother got up and knelt in bed , managing to make it look graceful . She crossed herself , then thanked Marian " for bringing my daughter to me . " Marian nodded , casually acknowledging the miracle . <p> Turning back to her daughter , she asked , " And how is Nuala ? " " Nuala is fine . It was she who sent me . " Put off by pleasantries , Clare went straight to the purpose of the midnight visit . " You must know Stepfather is dying . " <p> " I am sorry for that . But if incessant prayers and a hair shirt can not save him , what can I do ? " <p> " And Edmund .... " <p> " Edmund is dying too ? " Her mother looked hopeful . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . " It angered Clare that her mother instantly tried to wish away every problem . Mother sank back , looking from her to Marian , who wore an expression of virginal innocence , as if to say that Edmund was an Earthly issue . " What am I going to do ? " Clare demanded . " He means to rape and murder me . " Clare wanted to fight him , but did not have the means . She was not Nuala , and could not resist Edmund physically . She had come with the wild notion that she might pry her mother out of Fontevrault , getting her to come to Wales . Edmund was her stepson . Caeradar was her castle . Clearly that was not going to happen . Clare felt like a caterpillar crushed beneath a rock . Her mother sighed , " It is your father 's fault . " <p> " For dying ? " <p> " No . I mean your real father . He saddled me with that castle . " Clare 's real father was Richard FitzGilbert de Clare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabled adventurer who brought Norman rule to Ireland . The Earl and her mother had never been married , which made Clare a bastard , despite her famous name . The earldom of Pembroke , and the great Clare estates in England , Ireland , and Wales had gone to Strongbow 's legitimate daughter , Isabel de Clare , the damsel of Estriguil , who married William the Marshal  --  Good , courteous , beautiful , and wise " according to the troubadours . Clare and her mother got only the manor of Caeradar on the wild fringes of Glamorgan . <p> " I never wanted to be tied to some tiresome border castle , with naught but the Welsh for neighbors .... " <p> Clare said nothing . No one had given her a choice . Caeradar was all she had ever known . <p> " I wish your father were here , to see the mess he has made . " " Beware what you wish for . " Maid Marian snapped her thumb and a red-haired Norman knight appeared wearing a chain-mail hauberk with long sleeves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked a bit out of fashion with his bare mail and pointed helmet  --  surcoats and flat helms having just come into style - but was still suitably impressive , with a big Welsh longbow across his back and the three de Clare chevrons on his shield . He had broad shoulders and bowman 's arms , reaching all the way to his knees . <p> Clare saw at once why she so little resembled her mother . Never having seen her father , she had spent hours pouring over old marginal illuminations , trying to know his face , though the pictures were often tiny and in manuscripts dated long after his death . Hair and eyes were as she had imagined . But all those illustrations - even his stone effigies in the cathedrals - had not captured how much his living face resembled hers . His features were fine and delicate , almost womanish . Brows and chin , and the arch of his nose were hers writ large . <p> She stared in amazement . Until this moment her world had been defined by her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who was not her father . Matched against a boy who was not her brother . With no male protector , in a world where men did as they pleased . She was not just illegitimate , but a posthumous bastard to boot . " The most useless thing imaginable , " as Edmund liked to remind her . <p> Strongbow bowed politely to her mother , " You wished for me , my Lady . " His voice too was hers , pitched like woman 's , soft and courteous . <p> Mother sniffed , in no mood to be mollified . " I am no longer anyone 's Lady , thank goodness . " <p> Strongbow smirked , " You seemed eager enough at the time . " <p> " I wanted to be your wife . " <p> He spread his hands in apology . " Alas , that was not possible . " <p> " You married that heathen tart fast enough . " Mother never used Eva 's name - as if Clare could somehow not know it . <p> " Only for reasons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was destitute , and Dermot McMurrough of Leinster offered a kingdom . " <p> It already pained Clare to see her parents fight . Mother leaned back against the wall of her cell , arms folded . " And now you are dead and useless . " <p> " Believe me , that was never my plan . " <p> " A thin excuse for leaving your daughter in desperate straits . " She nodded at Clare . <p> " My daughter ? " Strongbow turned to stare , making Clare uncomfortably aware of her nudity . " This is the child you were carrying ? " <p> " Of course . She is why I called you here . " Mother deftly appropriated Marian 's miracle . <p> " What is her name ? " He seemed truly taken aback , suddenly confronted with his grown child . Clare saw that while she had known about him all her life , her father had no forewarning - so much for the dead knowing everything . <p> " I called her Clare . " <p> " She 's beautiful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from the heart . Clare had been called a million things , from " little clot of dung " to " Caer of Caeradar , the Rabbit Girl . " Never had she imagined this was the first thing her true father would say on seeing her . In a single stroke , Richard FitzGilbert de Clare , Earl of Pembroke , the conqueror of Dublin , Waterford , Wexford , and Leinster , had won over his daughter . She had prayed for some male protector , some Saint George or Sir Galahad in shining armor , never expecting it would be her dead father . <p> Turning about , he knelt before her mother , his gloved hand raised . " In the divine presence of Mary Mother of God , I promise to do all I can for our daughter . Whatever powers I have left , whatever gifts God may grant , I put them in her service . " <p> Mother snorted as if she had heard this all before , motioning Clare to her side . Clare carefully stepped around her kneeling father-though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mother warned . " He promised me the world , and could not deliver Ireland . I ended up destitute and alone at Caeradar , forced to marry your stepfather just to have a man at my side . " She gave Strongbow a hard look . " I know he looks as fair as he talks , but had he left us a decent living , instead of some wild Welsh manor , all would be different . " <p> Turning back to Clare , her voice softened . " Heaven knows , I have done you no better . I wish I had you here in these cloisters . I would have taken you with me , but your stepfather refused to let both of us go . And I could not abide a man who brings lice into bed . " If only one of them could escape , Mother made sure it was her - Clare thought it , but did not say it . <p> " I am sorry I could not do more . When your stepfather dies , I will take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caeradar , which makes you a prisoner of the world . " Witch 's Night was not over , but Mother had plainly had enough . Before the Lauds bell rang , Maid Marian whisked Clare back to the Camp of the Birds . <p> Besieged <p> RETURNING TO the room that had been her mother 's , Clare dressed in holy silence beside a sputtering puddle left by the burnt candle . She went back down to the sickroom when the Lauds bell rang in the chapel . <p> Afterward Nuala 's strong hands tucked her in . " I saw Mother , " Clare whispered . " And Father . " <p> " I know , " Nuala told her , pulling the coverlet over them . Clare snuggled up to the bigger woman . Had Nuala been there in spirit ? Her nurse never talked about witches ' flights , for fear of harming the spell . <p> And what about Gwen , asleep at the foot of the bed ? What sort of Witch 's Night did the Welsh girl have ? All Gwen ever said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O y ddawns neithiwr " - " From the dancing last night . " Despite living under a deferred death sentence , Gwen remained unfailingly cheerful , always making the most of the moment . Another Welsh habit that was hard to break . <p> Clare was up again at Prime to pray . Her stepfather continued to sink . He had not spoken , or taken solid food for a week . Women spooned soup into him , but that could keep him alive only so long . Clare thought of Edmund 's threat to wall her up without food , or water , or air . He had done half that already , making her a virtual prisoner , confined to the sickroom , the chapel , and her room above . Living under sentence , like Gwen . <p> She missed the freedom of walking through sunlit woods . Of having the rabbits she loosed on the Welsh come up to eat from her hand . Or of standing on the wall walk feeling the breeze blow , knowing she had it in her to fly beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to free her ? To disbelieve in magic was as unthinkable as denying religion - it flew in the face of all reason and experience . But she was scared enough to fear her witch 's flight had been some weird waking dream . Lulling her into doing nothing while fate closed in . <p> On Monday Clare awoke in dark morning aroused by a low moaning . The Lauds bell had rung , sending Nuala to stand vigil in the sickroom . Clare sat up in bed . Moaning grew into fevered groans , then a sharp panting coming from Gwen . Clare could hear the Welsh girl thrashing at the foot of the bed . She listened , horridly fascinated , fearing Gwen might be sick , then realizing her serving girl was having far too good a time . Giggling and crying out , Gwen used Welsh words she had never taught to Clare . <p> Lying back , Clare had a hard time getting to sleep . At Prime she got up to pray . Her maid lay sprawled on the floor , bedclothes in disarray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A dark fertile odor filled the room . When Clare returned from the chapel , she found Gwen going about her tasks with a guilty look . <p> By then Clare had other concerns . Armed men came riding up the Ebbw . From the roof of the keep , she recognized Bishop William of Llandaff with his personal retainers , plus a small escort of men-at-arms and a dozen mounted spearmen . Bishop William Saltmarsh was a good , pious , not very bright churchman  --  which might be why the Welsh let him through unmolested . <p> She entertained these visitors in the great hall on the third floor of the keep , the principal floor , with its middle wall replaced by massive columns . Wider windows , and the huge central light well , made the hall relatively airy , despite being enclosed by ten feet of stone . Edmund stood in for his father , and Clare for her mother . She wore a bright yellow tunic , topped by a damask surcoat and sable mantle , for the first time in days daring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not assault her before Bishop William and a brace of priests . <p> Bishop William explained that three nights running the Holy Virgin had appeared to him in a dream , beseeching him to bring the pious and ailing Lord of Caeradar to Llandaff . Either to recover , or be buried beneath the church altar . A surprising request that could hardly be refused . Pack animals were loaded with sumpter-saddles , and a horse-litter prepared . They had to leave at once , since the Lord of Caeradar did not look likely to last the night . Edmund would go with his father , taking half the castle garrison . He was welcome to take them all , so long as he went . Clare feared him more than all the Welsh in the hills . <p> Before taking Edmund away , Bishop William insisted on a private word with her . Bubbling inside , she did her best to look serious . Good old William Saltmarsh seemed near to death himself , and was forever taking her aside for a few encouraging words , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , bearing up a corpse . " Or something equally helpful . He had been a simple Bristol Abbot before his consecration , and barely spoke a word of Welsh . Which must have made him a puzzle to his parishioners , striving so earnestly in French and Latin to save their heathen souls . <p> " My child , " he told her , " this only concerns you . The Holy Virgin did not appear to me alone . All three times your father 's spirit was with her . Your true father , Earl Richard de Clare . " <p> Bishop William prattled on about how this was a lesson for everyone , the dead earl showing concern for his mistress 's husband . Atoning in part for his many sins of the flesh . Clare barely listened - being a prime result of that sinning , she never held it against her father . Instead she thanked his ghost with all her heart for helping get Edmund out of Caeradar . It was up to her to somehow keep him out . <p> Edmund and the Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clare watched from atop the gatehouse . When word came back from Llandaff that her stepfather had died , she would seize the castle and bar the door to Edmund , accusing him of treason . Of conspiring with the Welsh . Anything to keep him out . At the same time she would appeal to her feudal superiors . Even to Prince John if need be . <p> But first she just meant to be free of the walls . She had hardly left the keep since her stepfather fell ill , and had not been outside the baileys since St. John 's Eve . <p> Telling Nuala , " Pack some food , " she changed her pearl-stitched gloves and damask gown for a simple tunic and surcoat . She did not bother with boots , wanting to feel the green hay underfoot . Taking only a single mounted sergeant , she told Rory to turn out the pack . He and Gwen were supposed to be kept under lock and key , but if they meant to run off they would have done it by now . Going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse , her horse sergeant , and her pair of young Welsh prisoners - she felt at last like the lady of Caeradar . <p> The slope down to the river had black patches burnt in it from St. John 's Eve bonfires . On that shortest night of the year , castle boys brandished torches to scare off dragons and rolled burning wheels down to the river , symbolizing the sun 's turn toward winter . Now it was Clare 's turn to spin circles in the sunlight , glorying in her newfound freedom . <p> When she was done making herself dizzy , she had Gwen spread out the food Nuala had brought , oat bread , cheeses , salt fish , boiled meats , cider and almonds . Rory exercised the hounds . They were Welsh greyhounds , so silent and graceful they barely seemed like dogs , more like magical creatures , aloof and curious . <p> Clare decided to exercise her new power , asking Gwen , " What did you dream last night ? " She meant to allow no mysteries from the Lady of Caeradar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Welsh , " It was that sort of dream . " " What sort ? " <p> " The wrong sort . " No wonder she had awakened looking sheepish and smelling of sex . <p> " Really ? " Clare arched an eyebrow , surprised to find Gwen so flustered . Incubi were common in Wales , and Christian ways barely applied to the Welsh , who reveled in incest and premarital relations . <p> " O , the dream was a delight . But such visits are a sign of strife to come . " A safe enough prediction with the hill clans already in arms . " And all the more so because of the man . " <p> " What sort of man was he ? " Clare never had night visitors , neither in spirit nor in the flesh , making her curious . <p> " Your sort . A Saxon knight . " To the Welsh they were all Saxons . Clare had been born in Ireland , to Franco-Norman parents , but she was still a " Saxon . " <p> " Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deft arms , and a big strong bow across his back . " <p> " And chevrons on his shield ? " Clare made the sign in the air , and Gwen nodded . Her hostage maid servant had seen enough foreign heraldry to know whose spirit had lifted her night dress . <p> Clare sat back , stunned . She pictured her father 's ghost , kneeling in the cell at Fontevrault , making chivalrous vows to her mother , with the Holy Virgin looking on . Bastards know their fathers are not chaste , else how did they get to be bastards ? But galloping Welsh serving girls on the floor went a bit far . In her mother 's chamber . With Clare listening on the bed . Not the sort of spiritual support she had counted on . <p> And a sign of strife to come . A shiver crept down her spine . She glanced toward the castle . A gust of wind at the gate made the tall grass bow and bend . Slowly the line of nodding grass tops grew longer , heading down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a mournful groaning on the wind , like pipes played low and solemn . Bells tolled over the hills to the south . Greyhounds lifted their heads and howled . <p> Rory made no attempt to silence the hounds . He stood staring uphill toward the castle , watching the nodding line of grass continue its slow march toward the Ebbw . Nuala crossed herself , making the sign that wards off the evil eye . <p> " A faerie funeral . " Gwen looked serious , no longer shy or ashamed . " The Little Folk are preparing to receive a soul . " Rory turned to them , saying , " Someone will die . And soon . " No need to ask who . The line of bowing grass began at the gate Clare 's stepfather had left through , and the tolling bells came from the direction of Llandaff  --  where he had been headed . <p> And the Little Folk never lied . No one could live in Wales without knowing about the Little Folk , who lived underground , never ate meat , rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a land of play and pleasure . They were fair and long-haired , and detested surface folk 's pretenses and lies . Whatever they promised would come to pass . <p> Determined not to waste the faeries ' warning , Clare ordered Rory to call in the dogs , signaling to Nuala and the sergeant that they were returning to Caeradar . As they scrambled back up the hill toward the gate , she heard Gwen gasp . The serving girl grabbed at her arm and pointed downhill . <p> Clare saw a second slow line cutting through the field of grass , right behind the first one and a little to the side . Someone besides her stepfather was about to die . Clare pulled Gwen toward the gate . They could not stop to guess at who that second funeral might be for ; Clare had to get her castle into a state of defense . <p> She never got her chance . As they reached the gatehouse a voice called down in English , " Riders a-coming . " <p> " Bar the gate , " Clare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill . Men obeyed . She turned to her mounted sergeant . " Bar all the gates . And turn out the bowmen . " <p> Her sergeant pounded off to summon the bowmen and see to the lesser posterns . A soft familiar voice in her head whispered , " That 's the spirit . " <p> Clare shot up the gatehouse stairs , with Nuala and Gwen a half step behind her . Rory could be trusted to kennel his pack . He had a habit of treating the hounds as his , keeping him from having to hear obvious orders - but earning him blows for insolence , and for not acting as a proper hostage . <p> From the gatehouse tower Clare could see far down the green Vale . Woods covered the hills at either hand , broken by silver patches of river . A wagon track wound down the east bank , to connect with the bridge at Newport . She saw horsemen cantering up the track , entering the cleared space before the gate . With Edmund in the lead . <p> He drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me in . The Welsh ambushed us . Father and the bishop are taken . " Clare could believe it . Their horses looked blown . One man sat bent over his blood-spattered mount , barely holding on . Saddles and armor were feathered with Welsh arrows . She called down , " Go away . " <p> Edmund stared up in absolute disbelief . After years of bullying her , and plotting to put her away , he seemed utterly astonished that Clare dared deny him anything . As soon as his father fell to the Welsh , he had counted Caeradar as his . <p> Welsh bowmen came stumbling up the steps , stringing their six-foot bows . A half-dozen of them formed part of the permanent garrison . Coming from Gwent , they had no kin among the local hill clans , and could be semi-trusted in a crisis . <p> Edmund shouted up from below , " Open the gate , you silly strumpet . " The soft voice in her head said , " Daughter , have him dismount and approach alone . " Clare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , arrows nocked and bows bent . Her father repeated himself , <p> " Tell him to come forward , alone and on foot . " <p> " Why ? " she whispered , trying not to be seen talking to the air . <p> " So the archers can get a clear shot . " She stared down at Edmund . The Welsh bowmen would do it . They were glad to see the men below were Saxons , who could be punctured without setting Gwent and Glamorgan at feud . Edmund did not even deign to speak their language . <p> " Do it , " Strongbow commanded . " It is your life or his . " Clutching the stone , Clare leaned forward , remembering her visit to Abergavenny Castle-site of the infamous massacre , where the Sheriff of Hereford murdered his Welsh guests , and the men of Gwent had gone to get revenge . She had seen the points of Welsh arrows protruding from a gate door as thick as her hand . She called down to Edmund , " Go away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Strongbow ordered . " Come forward . " <p> " Begone , " Clare shouted . She could not bring herself to kill in cold blood . " Begone , or I 'll shoot . " <p> " Idiot whore , " he shouted back . " You would not dare . " That 's what you think . She turned to the archers , saying in Welsh , " Shoot . " <p> They shot . Arrows rained down on the disbelieving men below . Horses reared . Saddles fell empty . One man and mount spun in circles , an arrow passing through two folds of armor , the man 's thigh , and the horse 's saddle , had pinned the rider to the terrified animal 's flank . But the man Clare wanted to see dead was not so much as scratched . Edmund wheeled his mount and raced away from the gate without an arrow coming near him . <p> " That was foolish , " her father informed her . Not just foolish but fatal . Clare saw Edmund heading for the latrine portal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Welsh to follow , she ran along the wall walk to head him off . <p> Though she had the shorter distance , his horse beat her to the postem , a narrow door in the bailey wall used to service the kitchens and latrines . Two mural towers , and the keep itself , overlooked the little gate which led into the lower bailey . Edmund dismounted . She could hear him pounding on the door , shouting that the Welsh had turned on them , saying , " Let me in . The Welsh are coming . His lordship and the bishop are taken . " <p> Of course they let him in . With his father gone , the men below were bound to obey him . Who else could hold Caeradar against the Welsh ? Telling Gwen and Nuala to follow her , she leaped down onto the kitchen roof . No direct doors led from the wall walk to the keep - so even if the outer baileys fell , the great tower would be unbreached . But Clare had grown up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next . She left her Welsh archers on the wall walk , seeing no sense dragging them into a doomed struggle with the Saxon garrison . Jumping off the low kitchen roof , she raced across the bailey , beating Edmund to the main door of the keep . Bounding up the stone steps to the second floor entrance , with Gwen and Nuala at her heels , she ordered the door barred behind them . <p> At best that bought time . Edmund had more than half the garrison with him in the lower bailey , not to mention the kitchens and latrines . If she tried to hold the keep against him , someone would surely let him in . Father had been right ; only Edmund 's death could have saved her . <p> She led Nuala and Gwen straight through the keep and out the north door into the upper bailey . Bursting from shadowy stone back into bright sunlight , she shouted in Welsh for Rory . " Bring the hounds to the upper postern . " Seeing him emerge from the kennels with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate . <p> A narrow slice of rolling green Vale showed through the gap in the stonework , grassy slopes blended with wooded ridgelines fading into unbounded distance . Clare could feel the breeze blowing beyond the walls . It was the same gate where she released the rabbits . <p> " Go ! Quickly ! " she told her hostages in Welsh . " Ewch ! Cyflym ! " Rory did not stop to wonder . Saxon guards stared in astonishment as the dog-boy bolted out the postern and down the slope , followed by his hounds . <p> Gwen looked pained . She wavered in the gate , turning to give Clare a swift embrace . For years they had been playmates and private confidants , sometimes mistress and servant , ofttimes pupil and teacher , but always each other 's only same-age companion . Sisters are seldom so close . " Go , " Clare warned . " It will mean your life if you stay . " Gwen kissed her , then picked up her skirts and ran . <p> Clare watched them vanish , feeling terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nuala , who had been with her since birth . Telling her guards to close the high postern , she turned back toward the keep , very much a prisoner of the world . <p> As soon as she entered the shadow of the keep , she could hear Edmund shouting for the Welsh hostages to be brought up from the basement guardroom . It must have taken him all of a minute to convince the guards to open the main door for him . <p> Clare mounted the stone stairs , with Nuala at her side . Each step felt blunt and heavy underfoot . Her whole mismanaged life seemed aimed at this awful moment . Born a fatherless bastard . Abandoned by her mother . Her stepfather dead . Edmund was all the family she had left . And now she faced the fate he had been holding over her since they were children . <p> As she gained the second floor entrance , Edmund was storming about , ordering the Welsh hostages herded out the far door of the keep . Most of them were sons and nephews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at spearpoint down the steps into the lower bailey . Edmund glanced about . His gaze swept over her . Then he strode out into the sunlit bailey after his prisoners  --  without saying a word , without even pausing to gloat . Which almost seemed worse than a blow . Edmund clearly counted her as already his . A detail to be disposed of at leisure - of less consequence than his cowering Welsh prisoners . <p> She mounted the spiral stairs to the roof , with Nuala following close behind , keeping guard over her nursling . Skirting the rain water fishpond , and the great gaping lightwell , Clare ran to the south wall . From there she could see Edmund on the far side of the bailey , lining his hostages up along the gatehouse battlements . Leaning out an embrasure he began to harangue the silent countryside  --  largely in French . After living most of his life at Caeradar , he only knew enough Welsh to curse . He got no answer . Empty air and green countryside did not give back even an echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keeping a sharp eye on Caeradar . Nothing happened hereabouts without the Welsh knowing it . <p> When he finished his speech , Edmund turned to his prisoners . Clare watched horrified as he went down the line of hostages , picking victims at random . She could see he enjoyed having life or death power over his captives . Each hostage Edmund picked had his ankles tied together with a length of rope , then guards hoisted him up onto the battlements . After another barrage of insults , Edmund or his sergeant-at-arms would draw a knife across the prisoner 's belly , spilling out his intestines . Then they would heave him off the wall , to hang head down from the outer battlements , so the Welsh outside could see him die . <p> Some of the younger ones kicked and struggled , but most went stoically to their deaths , with only Edmund 's curses breaking the terrible silence . Clare had often seen the Welsh suffer gruesome injuries without so much as a whimper , though they could be appallingly loud at weddings and funerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When he was done , Edmund promised the mute countryside more of the same if anyone dared defy him . Then he stormed back across the bailey and into the keep , blood staining his hands . Clare cursed herself for not killing him when she had the chance . Her whole world seemed drowned in blood . Edmund was running amok , and now it would be war to the knife with the Welsh . <p> Mailed feet rang on the steps . She turned to see the sergeant-at-arms emerge onto the roof . He too had blood on his leather gloves . Less than an hour ago , he had been at her beck and call , now he would not meet her gaze . " Lord Edmund wishes to see his sister . " <p> Clare gave him a cold look . " And who would these people be ? " To her Edmund was lord of nothing , and hardly a brother . " Please do n't make this hard , m'lady , " the sergeant mumbled . He said it to her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse had stepped forward , planting herself between Clare and the man-at-arms . <p> Clare did not mean to take orders from a mere sergeant . She would die first - this was the roof she had aimed to throw herself off of . She told the man , " I am heiress to Caeradar , and keeper of the castle in my mother 's name . Obey me or suffer the consequences . " Clare could not say what those consequences were , but she hoped they would be dire . <p> Giving Nuala an uneasy glance , he held out a bloodstained glove . " Please come , m'lady . " <p> Clare stood her ground . If she let this man lay hands on her there would be no end to giving in . He stepped closer , meaning to take her whether she willed it or not . Nuala sprang at the armored sergeant , seizing him about the waist , lifting him off his feet . She shouted to Clare , " Run , my love . Seek sanctuary in the chapel . " <p> Instinctively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursemaid 's embrace - she dived down the spiral stairs , taking them two at a time . The dark stones of the keep closed around her , shutting out the shouts from above . <p> At the fourth floor landing , she stopped . The chapel lay just below her , on the main floor of the keep . But it was just a castle chapel , not a true sanctuary like Fontevrault . Edmund would come for her even if she clung crying to the altar . <p> She looked wildly about the upper hall , empty at the moment . Sunlight spilled out of tall window slits , and shone down the huge central light shaft . What was the use in running ? Nowhere could she be truly safe . <p> A man 's horrified scream echoed off the stones . Clare stared in terror as Nuala plunged through the lightwell in the ceiling , her big cloak flapping like bat 's wings . The sergeant , still locked in her grip , clawed the air as they fell . Together they shot through the hall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement cistern four floors below . <p> Clare screamed too . Turning about , she ran for her mother 's chamber , barring the oak door behind her . Tears blurred her view of the big stone bedchamber . She had meant to make a fight of it - to at least die with dignity . But whatever happened she had expected to have Nuala at her side . Now the big strong woman who nursed her , rocked her , and taught her witchcraft was gone . Ripped from her when she needed her most . <p> Someone pounded on the door at her back , demanding that she open it . The violence of the blows startled her out of her misery . Other than that door , there was no way in or out . She was in a stone box . Narrow arrow slits spaced along three of its walls showed thin slices of Welsh countryside . Called " murderesses , " the slits were too narrow to climb through , and three stories off the ground . The pounding grew louder . She recognized Edmund 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool . " <p> She did not answer , thinking of the Welsh children hanging from the wall . Edmund might be right , maybe she had been a silly fool to think she could defy him , but she knew it was death to open that door . " By God , I 'll have you flayed and boiled . " That was a new one . Clare leaned back against the door . A basin and pitcher by the bed held water . Bread and wine sat on the table beside a bowl of fruit . If she had known she had to stand a siege , she would have stocked the place better . <p> The pounding ceased . She could hear Edmund giving orders on the far side of the door . The pounding became a great banging . They were trying to batter the door in , probably with one of the benches from the upper hall . But the door was brass-bound oak , and the bar was iron , set directly into stone . She heard the bench splinter , followed by more cursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were going to cut their way in . Then what ? Clare knew she could not hold out forever . What would she do when the door came down ? A broad saxe knife lay on the table beside the wine . She went over and sat down next to it . The knife was big and ugly , but the blade was sharp . She had used it at breakfast to cut bread . Crazed with grief , she stared down at the sharply honed blade . Who could she use it on ? Edmund ? She had missed her chance to kill him . Herself ? He would get a good laugh at that . If only Nuala were with her . <p> Reaching out , she poured herself some wine . It was not the best , dark and fruity , barely fermented . But at least it was not bitter . There was grit in the bottom of the cup . A pinch of Irish soil , put there by Nuala to ward off poison . <p> Steel rang against wood . They had gotten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a matter of minutes they would be in . Oh , Mary help me . She gulped more wine . <p> " Do n't despair . " The voice sounded so beautifully light and matterof-fact , it seemed for a moment Mary had answered . She turned to see her father 's ghost at the far end of the room , long arms folded , leaning against the stone wall . Like at Fontevrault , he was in full armor , with his big bow across his back . <p> The ghost wore a mischievous grin . " You must have heard minstrels sing of the time I was besieged in Dublin Castle . Caught between High King Roderic O'Connor-who raised 30,000 clansmen from all across the island- and King Guthred of Man , who sat in the bay with a Viking fleet . I had but six score knights and a few hundred archers . Food became so dear a measure of flour sold for a silver mark . I would have given in myself , but King Roderic swore that I could only keep Dublin , Waterford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I do n't have six score knights , " she shouted at him . " Or so much as a single archer . " It was easy for him to be brave . He was dead already . " And Edmund is not Roderic O'Connor , " he reminded her cheerfully . " Or even Guthred of Man . But the principle 's the same . Never despair . Face your enemies with a bold front , and you can send them packing . " <p> A big hunk of the door burst inward . Clare looked up and saw a steel ax blade protruding from the wood . The blade withdrew , then came crashing back , sending splinters flying across the room . The door sagged . She seized the heavy saxe knife , putting it behind her back - still unsure how she meant to use it . More splinters shot into the room . She glanced hopelessly at her long-dead father . <p> The ghost smirked . " In the end , I sent King Roderic running naked from his bath . A sight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naught but a single sergeant . " <p> God , she thought , Mother was right . He 's mad . Utterly mad , and having a grand time of it . Reliving old glories . Visiting the bishop in his sleep . Tupping the Welsh chamber maid . But what has he done for me ? No one was standing up for her - except Nuala , and she had died for it . <p> The door gave way , splitting in the middle . A mailed hand reached in and slid the bar aside . Strongbow 's ghost vanished . Clare stood facing the doorway . Her hand tightened on the saxe knife behind her back . A bold front it had to be . She pictured herself driving the blade into Edmund 's throat . <p> The shattered door swung wide . Instead of Edmund she saw old Bishop William Saltmarsh of Llandaff , blinking like an owl in daylight . She had thought the Welsh had him , but here he was , looking more bemused than ever framed by the broken doorway . <p> " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . The Welsh are at the gate . They have Lord William . " <p> " Lord William alive ? " A wondrous reprieve . So long as her stepfather lived , Edmund could not be lord of Caeradar . <p> " Barely . I have been released on parole to arrange an exchange . " <p> " An exchange ? " <p> The bishop nodded , still dithering in the doorway . " I am afraid they wo n't give up Lord William until they get what they want . " <p> " What do they want ? " Whatever it was , she would give it - short of surrendering Caeradar itself . She thought immediately of the surviving hostages . Luckily Edmund had left some few alive . Their freedom would be a trivial price to pay for getting her stepfather back . <p> Seeing no alternative , old Bishop Saltmarsh summoned the courage to speak plainly . " My daughter , I fear what they want is you . " <p> " The Welsh are vindictive by nature , bloodthirsty and violent , avenging with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but old ones too , as if they were just received . " <p> - Gerald of Wales <p> Prisoner of the World <p> CLARE FOUND Edmund ecstatic . When Bishop Saltmarsh brought her down to the great hall , her stepbrother greeted her gleefully , " Sister dear , how good to finally see you . I hear you had trouble with your door . We must have it replaced . " <p> Any reply only added to his triumph . Edmund had won . He had Caeradar . And she would end up in the hands of the Welsh - to do with as they pleased . And with the bodies of their children hanging from the walls , what they pleased was bound to be unpleasant . The Welsh were thoughtlessly cruel , utterly unrestrained by chivalry , especially toward a " Saxon . " Perjury , theft , rape , fratricide , adultery and incest were so common they were hardly counted crimes . Neither God 's laws nor sworn oaths stood in the way of their vengeance . <p> She merely insisted on changing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , topped by a satin cape pinned with a pearl broach - the Welsh had to know they were getting a lady . When she opened the clothes chest she nearly wept . Folded in with the dress was the tiny feathered body of a black and white kingfisher . Nuala had put the dead bird there , to impart a pleasant odor and keep the wool safe from moths . <p> Edmund had a palfrey saddled , personally escorting her to the main gate . The Welsh were under the trees on the far side of the cleared space around the castle , dressed in linen war shirts and armed with spears , bows , and iron darts . Wild faces grinned above their round shields . <p> Edmund gave her palfrey a slap on the rump , saying , " I hope they send you back in pieces . " <p> Emerging from the black shadow of the bloodstained gatehouse into the sun-drenched clearing , she felt like she was being sent out to sea in a bottomless boat , with old Bishop Saltmarsh at the tiller . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wood , led by an old woman , barefoot and dressed in black , her white unbound hair hanging straight down . They met in the middle . Bishop Saltmarsh gave the palfrey 's reins to the Welsh woman , taking charge of the horse-litter . <p> Clare peered under the litter 's awning to see how her stepfather fared . Immediately she pulled back , muttering a prayer and crossing herself , seeing why the Welsh had sent a crone in black to give him to a priest . She was being exchanged for a corpse . Summer sunlight seemed to flicker . Sitting on her horse , halfway between the dark gatehouse and the black space beneath the trees , she heard Strongbow 's voice . " These Welsh are looking to get a lady . Do n't let them see you cry . " <p> What did he know ? In life he did as he pleased , and now he was beyond grief . She nodded to the woman in black , saying , " Ewch ! " Meaning , " Go ! " Having no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She still had the saxe knife hidden in her bodice . If she was brave , the best they could do was kill her . If she showed fear there would be no end to their impositions . <p> " That 's the spirit , " whispered her father 's ghost . <p> At the trees , cheering Welsh closed in around her , waving bows and spears , behaving like big bearded children with edged weapons . Shouting greetings in barnyard Welsh , they called her " Rabbit Girl " and the like . If the merry bandits meant to kill her , they would have a happy time of it . Just when she thought they would pluck her off the palfrey , Gwen pushed through the pack , saying , " Caer , Caer , it is so good to have you here . " <p> Clare managed a wan smile . Her former maid-servant took the reins , leading her into the woods , prattling on about how wonderful it all was , " How exciting to be home . " Rory was there , walking single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cutting her off from Caeradar . Looking over her shoulder , she could not even see the keep through the treetops . <p> Woods ahead got ever wilder . The path beneath her palfrey 's hooves thinned and narrowed , turning into a game trail . She did not dare ask where they were going  --  whatever answers they gave were equally unwelcome . Her captors treated the evil trek like a lark , sending a harper ahead of them , singing as he went . At a great cleft in the hills the trail went straight up , turning into a rocky stair climbing the wooded abyss , then disappearing completely . Here she had to dismount and lead the palfrey . The poor horse faced as dismal a fate as she did , taken from her warm stall and oat trough to stumble through wicked hills , starving on grass forage that would hardly feed a hare . <p> Atop the pass she remounted . Here the land opened up , revealing a patch of high treeless moorland with an ancient standing stone in its center , surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hauled the huge stone up to the summit . From that flat space Clare could see far and away , spying the great rounded billow of Mynydd Maen - the Mountain of Stone . To the north rose the first peaks of the Black Mountains , a dark bloodstained district , implacably savage even for Wales . Aside from such dismal landmarks , she felt so cut off from the world that she might as well have been on the moon . <p> Gwen reached up and took her hand , saying , " Caer , can you feel the magic ? " <p> Clare nodded silently . Any girl suckled by a witch could smell magic in the air . Bird song mixed with rushing water and the hot buzzing of summer . Farther off , the harper sang ahead of them . Saying a prayer for Nuala , she squeezed Gwen 's hand , then she kicked her mount and they started again . <p> Past the standing stone the trail reappeared , winding down into a wooded glen backed by tall cliffs . Torrents of white water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweet-william . At the foot of this hidden glen sat a robber 's roost , a square thatched hall half sunk in the ground , framed in oak and walled with lath and plaster , surrounded by fruit trees . Caeradar 's greyhounds bounded out to greet Rory . <p> Gwen helped her dismount , then pulled off her boots , washing her feet with water from an earthen well . Clare had seen the Welsh dig such wells , using forked sticks to find the right spot in a meadow or paddock , or even in the dirt floor of a hovel . They would dig down , and there would be water , cool and clear , deep beneath the ground . It was one of their more clever magics . <p> Inside the robber 's hall half an ox turned above the hearth , while a young girl sang and played on the harp . Children laughed and giggled at Clare . She wondered how such sweet winsome toddlers could be sired by astonishingly ugly brigands . Sitting her down , Gwen fetched ale to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which turned out to mean " hung goat . " <p> Wrung out from the day 's ordeal , Clare picked at her goat , confronted by table manners that would make the Irish wince . No napkins , no tablecloths , no tables , everyone ate together off the floor , from trenchers of boiled meat laid on green rushes . All were welcome at a Welsh feast . There was no such thing as a beggar- the first slice of meat always going to the poor . Rory sat beside her , eating from the same trencher . Typical Welsh manners , seating a dog-boy next to a lady . But no insult could make the day any worse . Or so she assumed . <p> " Eat , eat , " Gwen chided . " This is special . " Clare asked what was so special about hung goat . <p> Gwen leaned closer , whispering in her ear . " This is your wedding feast . " <p> " My what ? " She must have misheard the Welsh . <p> " Well , not a Saxon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certain . " Wedded to who ? " <p> " To Rory , of course . " <p> Clare stared in surprise at the red-headed dog-boy , fishing for meat from her trencher . Gwen reminded her , " Your brother Edmund swore many times that if he did not kill you , or lock you in a nunnery , he would wed you to Rory . Well , here you are , still alive and not a nun .... " <p> " Do n't I have anything to say ? " Clare hissed back . She had feared she might be killed or raped , but forced matrimony was an unexpected torture - even from the Welsh . <p> " Of course . " Gwen looked surprised . " Any woman can refuse to wed . But you are of age . And in your present condition you could hardly do better . Look at him . He is fair , his limbs are strong , and his toes are long and straight . And one of the hostages your brother murdered was our cousin , Gruffydd ap Cadwallon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is doing you an honor . Most men want to bed a woman before taking her to wife . " <p> Clare told her such talk was scandalous . It was hard to be a Christian under these conditions , but Clare meant to make the attempt - she had no other defense . <p> Gwen shook her head . " Not scandalous , Lady Caer , just common sense . Would you buy a pig in a sack ? Choosing a mate is at least as important . The man of my dreams must be as upright in bed as he looks in the saddle . But my brother is headstrong . And he has loved you for a very long time . " <p> Clare snorted . She had seen the man of Gwen 's dreams . As long as she had her saxe knife , no man or dog-boy was going to bed her at the finish of some drunken Welsh repast . No matter how long and straight his toes were . <p> She stared across the boiled meat at Rory . Like all Welsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troublesome hostage , prone to fits of gallantry . When she was seven , and Edmund knocked her down and broke her finger , it was Rory who picked her up , washed the mud off her , and carried her crying to Nuala . She had meant to thank him . But he had never asked for thanks , and she had never given it . <p> Seeing him here , in his own hall , he did look straight and upright , and tolerably clean - but a Welsh lordling , handy with dogs , was hardly what she had looked for in a husband . She had always pictured herself catching the eye of some young earl , or passing prince . But none ever passed that close to Caeradar . Now it turned out , she had long ago caught someone 's eye . <p> Singing and feasting went parts , all coming together ate into the summer evening . Even perfect B-flat harmony . children every scrap of food was eaten , a thin bed in , not singing along with their elders , but each taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end in perfect blanket harmony . When every scrap of food was eaten , a thin bed of rushes was made up along one wall . Guests and hosts slept together , using cloaks for blankets , children burrowing in among the adults . Gwen lay on one side of her , Rory on the other  --  making no attempt to take advantage of their makeshift " wedding " feast . Indeed , he had barely said two words to Clare , which irked her as much as physical insult . <p> She got up in the middle of the night to huddle by the hearth fire , stiff on one side , frozen on the other  --  thinking of her warm feather bed in Caeradar , and Nuala sleeping beside her . Many more nights like this might easily drive her mad . Slowly the fire warmed her , soothing her aches . Just when she was ready to attempt sleep , Gwen got up to join her . Then Rory . <p> The three of them sat by the night fire , just like when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady , and Gwen and Rory looked after her . Only this time there was no childish chatter . The day weighed hard on all three of them . Finally , Rory nodded toward the door , saying " Come . " <p> Clare looked at Gwen . Her former servant and would be sister-in-law took her hand , and they went out side-by-side . Rory waited in the moonlight , being greeted by his dogs . Observing a holy silence , he led them back up the glen . The dogs came with them . Guided by the sound of rushing water , they climbed to the summit of the pass , where the standing stone stood amid fairy rings . <p> Here Rory turned to speak , standing before the monolith , red hair shining in the moonlight , backed by his dogs . " First I will tell you my descent . I am Rory ap Owain ap Caradog ap Gruffydd .... " The boy went on and on , giving his descent back to Rhodri Mawr the ancestor of all South Welsh princes , then back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive display of memory , but being Welsh he could have easily gone back to Noah and the Flood . He ended by saying , " My sister will have told you I mean to make myself Lord of Ebbw Vale , and to take you to wed . " <p> Clare nodded . " So I have been told . " " I have planned this for some time . " <p> Clare nodded again . She remembered how it had felt to be lifted up and held by him the time Edmund had broken her finger . He had been big and strong , and angry at Edmund , but exceptionally tender with her , though smelling badly of dog . In the years since , she had somewhat caught up to him in size , and surpassed him in station  --  ceasing to be playmates , and becoming lady and servant . Until today . <p> Rory went on , " It is only proper that I ask your family 's consent . But your mother lives far away in the Land of the Franks . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my kin . " <p> Clare thought , " You could ask me ! " But she did not say it . Trying to deal rationally with the Welsh was as senseless as plowing the sea . " So I have brought you and Gwen here , that I may ask your father 's consent . " He nodded to Gwen , who knelt facing the priapic stone and crooned in Welsh , calling to her demon lover . <p> Strongbow 's ghost came striding into the clearing in full armor with his bow across his back . One look and the gazehounds went whimpering off , leaving the three humans and the spirit alone beside the standing stone . Gwen smiled and got up . <p> Rory addressed the ghost gravely . " You will know why I have called you here . I wish to marry your daughter , and make her the Lady of Ebbw Vale . I vow to keep her , and honor her , and take no concubines without her consent . " <p> " Admirable intentions , " Strongbow declared . " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer more than fair intentions . " <p> Clare cut in , feeling like the prize cow at a cattle auction . " This earl 's daughter refuses to be bartered over without her consent . " Whatever vows the boy made were bound to be meaningless . Not the promise of heaven , nor the threat of hell , could make the Welsh keep their word . They said whatever pleased them at the moment . And it clearly pleased Rory to have her to wife - he would say what it took to get her . <p> Strongbow looked taken aback . " Daughter , you must someday marry . This boy seems respectful , and marrying a savage has its special charms . I myself married an Irish princess .... " <p> " Much to Mother 's regret , " Clare pointed out . <p> " Your mother was never a practical woman . " <p> Rory interrupted , asking Clare , " What do you want ? " <p> " I want Caeradar . " It was all she had ever wanted . <p> " But Edmund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill him , " Strongbow suggested . " Hell would be all the happier for his company . " <p> Rory snorted . " Simpler said than done . " Despite being addicted to strife , the Welsh were loath to suffer losses  --  having no mercenaries or paid allies - no one but friends and family to send into battle . <p> " Use your native cunning , " Strongbow suggested . " An Earl 's daughter is not easily won . Did you ever hear of the time that I was besieged in Dublin .... " <p> Rory nodded . " By High King Roderic O'Connor with 30,000 clansmen , and a Viking fleet in the bay . The harpers sing of it . " <p> Strongbow beamed , turning to Clare . " I told you he was a boy of parts - and educated to boot . You could well do worse . " <p> Clare said nothing . Doing worse was not at all her aim . <p> " But you were safe within the walls of Dublin , " Rory pointed out . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong castle , behind heavy barred gates .... " <p> " But he will open them for me , " Clare declared . Ghost and dog-boy turned to stare at her . <p> She crossed her arms , looking levelly at Rory . " If I get Edmund to open the gates . And if you defeat him . And if I am once more Lady of Caeradar . Then I will consider your suit . " If you are brave , and loving and I get a church wedding . <p> Her father 's ghost grinned . " Spoken like a Strongbow . My daughter has given her terms - now you must meet them . " Despite all that had happened , her heart still leaped when he called her daughter . The ghost winked at Gwen and disappeared , leaving his bow behind . <p> Rory bent down and picked it up . It was no ghostly bow , but a real South Welsh longbow , cut from dwarf-elm , rough , unpolished , and deadly . He slung it over his shoulder and they trooped back toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs came loping up to greet them . <p> A ten-day later Clare saw Caeradar again . In the first blush of morning she came riding out of the wood on her palfrey headed past the upper bailey . Gwen rode at her side , aboard one of those meddlesome little Welsh ponies . Rory 's dog pack loped ahead of the horses into the cleared space around the castle . The hay had not been cut , and as the hounds bounded forward they appeared and disappeared in the tall green-gold grass . <p> When the Welsh first took her into the woods , she had thought she was seeing the castle for the last time . It felt strange to see Caeradar again , knowing she could not just go cantering up to the postern . It was the Rabbit Gate , the one she had released Rory and Gwen through . <p> She had made sure she looked her best . Her blue riding dress was scrubbed and mended , and her cape was turned out to show the yellow satin lining . She wore a wreath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her neck . More gold shone on her wrists and ankles . She felt part Welsh princess , part Our Lady of the May . <p> The postem gate swung open . Clare cut slowly across the cleared space , not aimed for the postern , riding like she meant to pass beneath the castle walls and head on down the Ebbw . As if she were going to call on the Bishop in Llandaff , or visit her cousins in Caerleon . <p> Edmund came riding out with a troop of horsemen at his heels , the castle men-at-arms and twenty mounted sergeants , trampling down the uncut hay . Edmund looked wary , dressed in a chain-mail hauberk and coif , and wearing a steel skull-cap . Clare knew he would come out . He might not have come if she had begged or threatened - but he could not let her ride lackadaisically past , as if she had not a care in Creation . <p> Nor could he be sure she would not make trouble downriver . Bishop Saltmarsh might easily take her side . Together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clare , the " wise and good " Damsel of Estriguil , and her over-scrupulous husband , William the Marshal renowned for his honor and integrity . Or they could go to the Countess of Gloucester , who was married to Prince John . One of them might be willing to hear her case . If he let her slip past . <p> Clare reined in , watching him come on . She rose in her saddle , calling out in a clear voice , " Leave me be . " <p> Edmund smiled . That was one thing he could not do . Since the Welsh had not killed her , he wanted her in his hands . <p> " I beseech you . Go back , " she shouted . Clare wanted it to be clear , to God and to all , that she had given him fair warning . The Lord Almighty does not seek the death of the sinner , but to see him turn away from wickedness . <p> Edmund spurred his horse forward , his brisk confidence returning . The more she begged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had her . <p> She settled back in her saddle , saying a soft prayer for Edmund 's sake , " Then may Mary have mercy on you - even as you have shown no mercy to me . " <p> Welsh rose up out of the long grass . Four dozen Gwent bowmen , whose fathers and uncles had been murdered by the Sheriff of Herefordshire at the Abergavenny massacre - men always thirsting for revenge against the Saxon . Rory was with them , rising up and stringing her father 's bow . They had hidden there half the night , with their bowstrings coiled beneath their armpits , to save them from the dew . <p> The first flight of arrows caught the mounted men as they reined in , slicing through mail and leather jacks , creating havoc among the horses and emptying saddles . Two more flights was all it took to send the survivors fleeing for the bailey gate . <p> Rory bounded after them , calling on Edmund to stand and fight . At the same time Gwen loosed the pack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey . Welsh greyhounds are near to being the fastest creatures on four legs , far faster than a horse and armored rider . They quickly had Edmund 's horse turned , leaping out of the grass in the startled animal 's face , herding the frightened mount like some man-carrying sheep . <p> Rory planted himself in the horseman 's path , bending the big roughcut bow . Edmund had his broadsword out , beating at the dogs . Seeing Rory he spurred his horse , guiding it with his knees , his shield covering his chest , his sword arm straight in front of him locked behind the point . <p> Standing with bow bent , the nock to his ear , Rory waited until he could barely miss . Then his fingers released , and Strongbow 's bow sang . Clare saw her father 's ghost guiding the shaft . The arrow sped right between the horse 's ears , over the top of the shield , and beneath the steel cap , straight into Edmund 's right eye . <p> Edmund 's head snapped back , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerveless fingers . He was dead before he felt the blow . An easier death than he had given others . <p> Running up , Rory set down the bow and retrieved the fallen broadsword , using it to take off Edmund 's head . He stood triumphant in the hay , giving a glad , fierce Welsh war cry , holding up Edmund 's head by its bloody blond hair . The arrow shaft still stuck out of one eye . <p> Turning her head away , Clare heard her father 's ghost applaud , " Well done , lad . " All she could think was , " This is the boy I mean to marry ? " <p> " Women are naturally inclined to witchcraft ... the more women there are , the more witches there will be . " <p> - The Talmud <p> Next Friday , Witch 's Night found Clare by the banks of the Rhone dancing naked under the arches of the ancient bridge at Avignon . Gwen was with her , along with her mother , and witches from Ireland , Spain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring of dancers , women whirling around her , arms raised crescent-wise above their heads , singing : <p> " Sous le pont d'Avignon , on y danse tout en rond ... " <p> A night wind blew the odors of the crowded city from across the river . Avignon 's narrow filthy streets were so crammed with sewage , tannery waste , and open privies that the summer heat caused country visitors to faint . But on Witch 's Night the only swooning came from women overwhelmed by worship and the dance . <p> When the dancing was done her mother introduced her to Queen Eleanor , the patroness of Fontevrault , Queen of England , France , and Ireland , and Dutchess of Aquitaine . Though there was no royalty on Witch 's Night , Clare fell to her knees . Eleanor had long been her heroine , the mother of King Richard and Prince John , coming from a famous family of excommunicates , having been personally damned by Saint Bernard . Near to seventy , she was still tall and stately , with long white hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nude . <p> Eleanor smiled . " Rise , young lady . On Mother 's night we kneel only to Mary . " <p> Clare rose , still in awe of her queen . She could well believe the story that an infidel Sultan once begged Eleanor to be his Sultana . <p> " Your mother says you will soon wed , " observed Eleanor . Clare nodded , afraid to speak . <p> " You are young . But so was I when I married my first king . As heiress of Aquitaine I had no choice . In the end , I had to marry a couple of kings to keep lesser lords from committing matrimony on me . " Clare said it was much the same with her . " And do you love him ? " Eleanor asked . <p> Clare could not lie to her . " I do not know . Right now it feels like a grand adventure , all glorious and exciting . He is brave and comely , and Gwen 's brother . " She introduced her **26;1680;TOOLONG . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freed him , and he saved me . He has loved me since I was little , and together we shall rule the Ebbw Vale . " <p> " That is not the same thing as you loving him , " Eleanor reminded her . " I know , " Clare admitted . <p> Clare 's mother shook her head . " I envy her excitement . I loved a man dearly , but we were never married . Never together before the world . " <p> " And does that make you sad ? " asked the Queen . Her own marriages had been notoriously unhappy . One husband divorced her , her second husband imprisoned her . For sixteen years her only freedom had been on Witch 's Nights . <p> " Sometimes , " Clare 's mother admitted . " But in one way I am infinitely blessed . " <p> " How is that ? " Clare had never heard her mother speak so wistfully about her love for her father . <p> Mother reached out and took her hand . " I had a child by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are a love child in every sense of the word - conceived in love , and love alone . Not for inheritance . Not for advantage . I would not have missed being your mother for anything . Not even to be .... " <p> Mother stopped , flustered , flushing all the way down to her toes . Queen Eleanor smiled at her embarrassment . She knew women commonly said that they would not give up this or that , " Not even to be Queen of England and France . " They just never said it to her face . <p> Mother came to Llandaff for the wedding . They were married by Bishop Saltmarsh in his great Celtic church , with the Welsh on one side and the Normans on the other . Prince John was there to give her away . He was merely Earl of Gloucester - and that only by right of marriage - but since Good King Richard was well-known to be a sodomite , John was bound to succeed him . Already he had his own court , with a justiciar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William de Briouze , who planned the Abergavenny massacre , along with his sharp-tongued wife , who had danced naked with Clare beneath the bridge at Avignon . <p> Across the aisle the Welsh were led by Rory 's royal kinsmen , Lord Rhys ap Gruffydd and Prince Morgan of Glamorgan , happily watching one of their own becoming lord of a Norman keep . Glad to win Ebbw Vale back from the Saxon . <p> Gwen was maid of honor . And Strongbow 's ghost was there at the altar to give Clare to Rory - but only the three of them could see him . <p> Author Affiliation
