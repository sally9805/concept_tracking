They call it the Ultimate Star Party  --  ultimate because it draws observers with really big scopes who want to do nothing but observe . No talks , no vendor tables , no lines to look at M13 . .. just hard-core , look-at-that-faint-fuzzy observing . Set high atop a plateau in the Davis Mountains of southwest Texas , this year 's star party has three 36-inch telescopes , four 25s , six 20s , and a slew of 12- to 18-inchers . I 've escaped my light-blitzed , southeast Wisconsin skies with a pair of 14x100 binoculars . What will two eyes working with twin 4-inch " telescopes " really see in these dark , Texan skies ? I 'm dying to find out , but like everybody else at this party , I 'm seduced by aperture  --  large aperture . So I bug my neighbor Bob Ross for a look through his giant scope . Bob comes from Colorado with his 36-inch f/5 Dobsonian . Always looking to reduce the number of trips up and down his observing ladder , he uses binoculars to survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my efficiency 30 percent , " he cheerfully volunteers . Ask him for a peek at any " top 40 " deep-sky object and the exchange is liable to go along these lines : " Bob , think we could look at Stephan 's Quintet ? " " Naw , John , I 'm cracking this Abell galaxy cluster tonight . " The clock drive for Bob 's scope lies somewhere deep in the frontal lobe of Bob 's brain , and tonight it 's going to nudge this 15-foot-high monster scope along as Abell 119 rises in the east , transits , and sets in the west . Bob 's life goal : To see every object listed in both volumes of Uranometria 2000.0 . Back home , when the Moon 's out , he uses a 15-inch Clark refractor to catalog lunar domes . Alabama trauma surgeon Bob Haas also observes Abell galaxy clusters with a 36-inch scope , but unlike the other Bob he 's often sidetracked by requests to look at easier-to-spot objects , say , in the 11th magnitude range . The cool desert night forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is clad only in shorts and a tee-shirt . He keeps warm  --  dare I say overheated  --  by man-handling his scope from object to object . " Anyone for M57 ? " his voice rings out over the star party din . Nearby observers , those who labor under the heavy obligation of having to look for faint fuzzies , can hardly believe their ears . For Haas , every target promises the excitement of a trip to Disneyland , be it an elusive UGC object or the Ring Nebula in Lyra . " You really ought to look at this . There are extensions all over the place tonight ! " Some gray forms saunter over to the ladder 's base , almost begrudgingly . I take my turn at the eyepiece by climbing Bob 's 15-foot ladder . Up , up  --  the rungs seem to keep coming  --  until on the top step I stand swaying in the wind , my mind calculating whether the shroud on Bob 's behemoth will break the impending fall . Then I see it . Bear in mind that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over four inches , but in a 36-inch it 's , well , a cosmic experience . Surrounding the donut-shaped ring are faint tendrils , and spread across the hole is a mottled sheen of light through which the nebula 's 15th-magnitude central star shines . Bright portions of the ring are an electric blue-green . Looking away for a fraction of a second , I can see a dull gray after-image burnt into my retina . My eyes water , from wind or wonder , I 'm not sure . Haas senses my reaction and lets out an Alabama giggle : " Time 's up , buddy . Let someone else have a look . " While making my white-knuckled descent , I glance in the direction of Houston 's Larry Mitchell , who has the party 's third 36-inch . Last year Larry 's wimpy minivan was barely able to haul his scope up the plateau . This year he comes in style , armed with a Lincoln Continental  --  not for the luxury , but for the brawn a 400-cubic-inch engine can offer on mountain roads . Matching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many veteran observers consider it a sport to try to stump this guy on deep-sky trivia . Ask him for stats on any obscure galaxy cluster ( I tried one that 's in the nape of the Horsehead Nebula 's neck ) , and he 'll just roll his eyes up into their sockets and do a data dump . ( All this without the benefit of mind-expanding dietary supplements . ) There is one mystical substance making the rounds at this year 's USP : billberry pills . During the Battle of Britain , legend has it , Royal Air Force Spitfire pilots took these pills to enhance their night vision . The thinking goes that what worked for pilots defending the Realm against Nazi aggression surely ought to work on photon-starved deep-sky observers under dark , Texas skies . Many USPers claim a better than one magnitude improvement in visual acuity . I pop a couple and really do n't notice a difference . They 're found at any health food store , if you want to give them a try . Sheryl Johnson and Debbie Serle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sell the stars for a living to schools throughout Southern California . Their business , " Adventures in Astronomy , " presents school assemblies and star parties to teachers and students in kindergarten through university . Over the past five years , they figure close to 100,000 people have traipsed up their ladders and looked at the cosmos . " We 're like cosmic Johnny Appleseeds sowing generations of astronomers to come , " Sheryl says , her voice wafting over the gentle chords of New Age music . The music , the large-aperture scopes , ( the billberry pills ? ) have conspired to make my head swim . Time to wander the firmament and discover wonders by serendipity . I retreat to my monster binocs . In one corner of the field , I use them to grasp and glean 3-1/2. degree chunks of the sky . Extremely faint and subtle IC 342 , a face-on galaxy in Camelopardalis , fills the whole field of view . Wisps of bluish nebulosity splash from the stars of the Pleiades . The great spiral galaxy M31 in Andromeda , sporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hear myself filling the desert air with ooohs and aaahs . Distant coyotes answer in parody . There 's a tap on my shoulder  --  it 's Bob Ross down from his ladder to see what all the commotion 's about . I oblige him by dialing in object after object that knocked at least a layer of socks off my feet . Soon Bob has binoc fever . Never in a million years , he says , would he have expected to see stuff so faint and in such detail through  --  gulp  --  binoculars . A born-again binocular man Perhaps not , for there are many wonders awaiting him through an eyepiece in the business-end of a 36-inch . He goes back to his ladder , and for a moment I set aside the binocs to just look at the sky . The big scopes silhouetted against knots of dark and light along the Milky Way say it all . They go deep , I go wide , real wide . The gentle murmur of voices , a warm , silky breeze on my face . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p>
