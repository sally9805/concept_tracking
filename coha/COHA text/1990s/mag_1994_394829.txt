Nothing beats an evening prowling the summer Milky Way with a rich-field telescope . Into one amazing field of view you can crowd all of the North America Nebula or the whole Scutum star cloud , with M11 tucked into one corner . Then there 's that dark nebula between Cygnus and Cepheus ... again in one field of view . Celestron 's new 7.9-inch f/4 Newtonian telescope is designed for those who enjoy scanning the heavens at low power with a moderate aperture . Some call this observational approach the " travel light but carry a big scope " way of doing amateur astronomy . And in a time when an observer needs to travel miles to escape light pollution , scope portability takes on a whole new meaning . A traveler 's dream , the GP-C200 's 800mm focal length fits into a tube less than three feet long and 8-1/2 inches in diameter , and weighs less than 15 pounds . When racked in all the way , the two-inch focuser sticks out only four inches from the tube assembly . And the finderscope releases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Polaris equatorial mount ( made for Celestron by Vixen ) , which the optical tube assembly connects to by means of a quick-release dovetail bracket . The mount has extendable wooden legs topped by an ample equatorial head . Built into the tripod leg spreaders are holes for mounting an accessory tray that comes with the scope . Together , the tripod and equatorial head weigh 28 pounds ; a good deal of that comes from two removable 6-pound counterweights that balance the optical tube . GREAT OPTICS At the heart of the GP-C200 is a fully aluminized 7.9-inch Pyrex primary mirror with enhanced coatings to improve reflectivity . The mirror is supported in its cell at three points and held in place with three edge clips . You collimate the primary mirror by using a hex wrench to adjust three sets of push/pull button-head screws that lie flush with the sealed end of the telescope tube . Three hex-head screws that are covered by a removable metal plate adjust the secondary . Celestron mentions in the telescope 's manual that the optics leave the plant in perfect collimation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mirror . Treating this with a modicum of skepticism , I carried the scope out to a backyard site several times and threw it on the back seat of my car for two trips to a dark-sky site . After being subjected to several weeks of rigorous handling , the optics stayed in collimation . Obviously , what appears to be a simple mirror cell works more than adequately in keeping the main optics aligned . But fine collimation amounts to nothing if the main mirror is fabricated imperfectly . In star tests using a 7mm Nagler eyepiece coupled to a 2.5x TeleVue Barlow ( 230x ) , the mirror displayed virtually identical diffraction rings on either side of focus . If the main optics had spherical aberration , the inner diffraction rings would have looked brighter inside of focus and dimmer outside of focus . The perfectly circular ring pattern also attested to the system 's precise collimation and the lack of any astigmatism . Also , if the main mirror were in any way pinched by its mounting cell ; the circular ring pattern would have appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter . Under the scrutiny of 230x , the planet 's belts , zones , ovals , and festoons appeared distinct , as did the numerous comet impact sites . This level of planetary image fidelity impressed me , considering that the GP-C200 is an f/4 system better suited to wide-field observing . The secondary mirror blocks a substantial portion of incoming light ; its area is 28 percent that of the primary mirror . Despite this , images through the eyepiece still showed a remarkable level of contrast . So you can obtain a greater range of magnification from your collection of eyepieces and have more flexibility for photography , Celestron offers a tele-extender that increases the GP-C200 's focal length to 1,440 mm and its focal ratio to f/7.5 . This accessory threads into the focuser assembly and yields more observing flexibility when you need higher powers . I used this accessory and a 7mm Nagler ( 212x ) to split clearly Lyra 's famous " double double , " Epsilon ( epsilon ) Lyrae . I was quite satisfied with the results . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this I used a University Optics 20mm Wide Scan eyepiece , which yielded a view of just over 2deg at a magnification of 40 . As was to be expected with a low f/ratio scope like the GP-C200 , stars on the eyepiece 's edge of view had the appearance of being slightly flattened , an effect called " coma . " After threading Celestron 's optional coma corrector into the focuser , I was rewarded with edge-to-edge sharpness with no apparent loss of brightness or contrast . I spent hours wandering the length of the summer Milky Way and greeted the dawn by looking at M31 and many open clusters sprinkled throughout Cassiopeia and Perseus . THE TUBE These optics are housed in a rolled aluminum tube finished with high-gloss , chip-resistant black paint . Complementing the scope 's potential is a 2-inch focuser that racks in and out through a distance of one inch . Threaded surfaces and adapter rings incorporated into the focuser barrel allow for the attachment of Celestron accessories such as a coma corrector , an f/7.5 tele-extender , an off-axis guider , a 2-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes with the scope ) . Oversized , 1-1/4-inch knobs make the rack-and-pinion focuser easy to operate . A lock knob holds the barrel in place once you reach the desired focus . The GP-C200 comes equipped with a 6x30 finder that slips and locks into a dovetail track just forward of the focuser . The finder stands 4-1/2 inches off the tube , which makes it very easy to sight objects without bumping the main scope . The tube 's dovetail track is universal enough to accept holders that accommodate larger finders from Celestron or other suppliers . Tube rings secure the telescope to the rest of the mount . The tube can be rotated to a convenient viewing angle by loosening the 1-1/4-inch knobs , which are large enough to grasp with gloves  --  a bonus for wintertime observers . Inside each ring is a layer of felt that allows the tube to rotate smoothly and stay firmly in place after the ring knobs are tightened . Protruding through the top of each ring is the threaded end of a hex-socket screw . These serve as attachment points for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND TRIPOD Before attaching the telescope to the equatorial mount , it 's important to align the mount with the north celestial pole . First the mount 's polar axis must be set at the same angle as the observer 's latitude . This is very easy using a fine altitude adjustment screw along with the latitude scale printed near the pivot point of the axis . The GP mount can be adjusted to work between latitudes 15deg and 65deg . Once the polar axis is set to the proper angle , it must be aimed at the north celestial pole . For general observing , precise alignment is n't really necessary ; the polar axis need only point in a northerly direction . A raised letter " N " on the GP mount indicates which side should face north . This rough alignment method provided me with enough precision to keep an object centered in a medium-power eyepiece using the mount 's hand-operated , slow-motion controls . For astrophotographers who require a more precise alignment , the GP mount 's polar axis has a north celestial pole finderscope built into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pole 's location , and two adjustable scales take into account the time of year and local time . For further alignment , a fine adjustment knob pivots the equatorial head left and right . A five-minute procedure using these features aligns the mount dead on the pole . For doing astrophotography , this eliminates a major source of tracking error . The GP-C200 also has clear instructions on how to precision-align in the Southern Hemisphere , where no bright pole star like Polaris exists . A steady mount is critical for both photographic and visual use . While observing at around 200-power , I rapped the mount and measured an exceptional dampening time of between 2 and 3 seconds . This time remained consistent through a wide range of light-weight to heavy eyepieces . Not only is the mount stable , but it has a very smooth manual tracking system . Keeping an object centered , even at high power , was simple using 1-1/2-inch-wide slow-motion knobs attached to the right ascension and declination axes . Astrophotographers should be aware that a drive controller , which includes motors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celestron at extra charge . While not having a drive motor at first seemed to be a hindrance to observing , I found that the mount 's slow-motion controls were more than adequate for rich-field , low-power observing . And it 's this level of observing that the scope excels at . In all I found the GP-C200 to be a stellar performer , both mechanically and optically . And for a few dollars more , the telescope should prove itself to be an exceptional astrophotographic tool . Is it worth the $1,500 price tag ? For a portable , photographically fast telescope I believe it is . The GP-C200 design offers the astrophotographer and visual observer plenty of room to roam through their respective areas of interest . In this era or optimized refractors and hybrid reflectors , it 's especially refreshing to see that the time honored , rich-field Newtonian reflector has n't been neglected by commercial telescope manufacturers .
