They combine most of the virtues of a scope with light weight and small size . Why are n't they more popular ? Read on and find out . // IT 'S STRANGE BUT IT 'S TRUE . America is the world 's leader in technology and scientific innovation , but American shooters are as hidebound and stodgy a lot as you 'll find . It took decades for the average hunter to discover the advantages of telescopic rifle sights , and now the same slow process is going on with electronic sights . More 's the shame , because they can do some things better than any scope or iron sight . The typical electronic sight is less expensive than a telescopic sight of comparable quality . Its small size makes it less cumbersome than a regular scope and that , along with its lighter weight , has less effect on the handling and feel of a firearm . Then there is eye relief : Where the eye relief of all rifle and handgun scopes is quite limited , it is virtually unlimited in the electric sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eye is 2 inches or 2 feet away . If you 've ever been pounded in the eyebrow by the ocular-lens bell of a scope , this will mean a great deal to you . FASTER THAN FAST Electronic sights are far easier for the beginning shooter to master than scopes or open sights . You simply plaster the big red dot where you want the bullet to go and squeeze the trigger . And finally , far-sighted shooters with eyes that absolutely refuse to focus on the front sight of a firearm will find the electronic sight to be a godsend since it does n't require the use of corrective-lens eyeglasses . And there 's more . The relatively narrow tube of a telescopic sight restricts the shooter 's field of view , but an electronic sight , properly used , has an unlimited field . You do n't look into it as you do a scope . You simply keep both eyes focused on the target and squeeze the trigger as the red dot settles where the bullet is supposed to go . And since most electronic sights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target even if the dot is nowhere near the center of the tube . Photograph For eyes that can no longer focus on the front sight of a handgun , a red-dot is the answer to a prayer , since it puts sight and target in the same optical plane . // All of this makes the electronic sight quicker than quick to use . Out to 25 yards or so , an experienced handgun shooter can centerpunch his target in well under a second , and that includes the time it takes him to react to the buzzer of an electronic timer , raise his gun , aim , and pull the trigger . WHERE THEY SHINE With the exception of Aimpoint 's 5000-2X model , electronic sights do n't magnify , so they 're best for shooting at targets no farther than 100 yards or so . This makes them ideal for close-range plinking , casual target shooting , and small-game hunting with .22 rimfire rifles and handguns . The electronic sight is an excellent choice for use on shortrange woods rifles such as the Winchester 94 , Marlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolvers in .41 and .44 magnum , and .454 Casull . In states and hunting areas where their use is not prohibited , electronic sights also work great on in-line muzzleloaders . Shotgunners of an experimental nature occasionally give red-dot sights a try at skeet , Sporting Clays , and wingshooting , but they have n't really caught on , and I 'll be surprised if they ever do , because they 're designed for aiming , not for pointing . However , you who hunt big game with shotguns and slug loads will find the red-dot sight to be just the ticket for bringing home the venison . But it 's on a turkey gun that the red-dot sight really shines . Anyone who has patterned a few shotguns knows that it 's not uncommon to see a shotgun throw the main part of its charge somewhere other than where you 're aiming . But an electric sight enables you to zero your shotgun just as you would a rifle , and once that 's done the gun will throw the center off its pattern precisely where the red dot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many hunters are scared off red-dot sights because they depend on batteries . They visualize themselves aiming at the trophy of a lifetime and , without warning , the red dot suddenly shuts off . Wo n't happen . For one thing , battery life for most sights is far longer than most hunts , even if the dot is allowed to burn 24 hours per day for the entire hunt . And besides , the dot does n't suddenly switch off as the battery grows weak . It grows noticeably dimmer , which is your cue to put in a fresh battery , which you had the foresight to keep in your daypack . Most electric sights are rated as water-resistant , with very few rated as waterproof . Even so , I 've hunted in Alaska with a water-resistant sight when it rained all the time , and it came through with flying colors . All I did was keep it covered with my raincoat . Mounting an electric sight is no more trouble than mounting a scope . You have to be able to read the directions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a hardkicking handgun requires strong rings and bases that will not let the sight slip , and that some rings and bases are stronger than others . I suggest that when you purchase your mounting system , you get it from a dealer who 's had experience with serious handguns . To paraphrase the old adver rising slogan , red dots mean sure shots . Give one a try . <p>                     @x 743 A.L . <p> <p> Commerce weighs value , yet such weight is but an image , and , as such , is an illusion . <p> The bell announcing dinner rang twice , just twice , and no more , for it never did . Rousel leapt up from his table desk in the sitting room that adjoined our bedchambers , disarraying the stack of papers that represented a composition doubtless due in the morning . " I 'm starved . " <p> " You 're not . You 're merely hungry , " I pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table desk . " ' Starved ' means great physical deprivation and lack of nourishment . We do n't suffer either . " <p> " I feel starved . Stop being such a pedant , Rhenn . " The heels of his shoes clattered on the back stairs leading down to the pantry off the dining chamber . <p> Two weeks ago , Rousel could n't even have pronounced " pedant , " but he 'd heard Master Sesiphus use it , and now he applied it to me as often as he could . Younger brothers were worse than vermin , because one could squash vermin and then bathe , something one could not do with younger brothers . With some fortune , since Father would really have preferred that I follow him as a factor but had acknowledged that I had little interest , I 'd be out of the house before Culthyn was old enough to leave the nursery and eat with us . As for Khethila , she was almost old enough , but she was quiet and thoughtful . She liked it when I read to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Rex Regis or Rex Defou . Rousel had never liked my reading to him , but then , he 'd never much cared for anything I did . <p> By the time I reached the dining chamber , Father was walking through the archway from the parlor where he always had a single goblet of red wine  --  usually Dhuensa  --  before dinner . Mother was standing behind the chair at the other end of the oval table . I slipped behind my chair , on Father 's right . Rousel grinned at me , then cleared his face . <p> " Promptness ! That 's what I like . A time and a place for everything , and everything in its time and place . " Father cleared his throat , then set his near-empty goblet on the table and placed his hands on the back of the armed chair that was his . <p> " For the grace and warmth from above , for the bounty of the earth below , for all the grace of the world and beyond , for your justice , and for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude , both now and evermore , in the spirit of that which can not be named or imaged . " <p> " In peace and harmony , " we all chorused , although I had my doubts about the presence and viability of either , even in L'Excelsis , crown city and capital of Solidar . <p> Father settled into his chair at the end of the table with a contented sigh , and a glance at Mother . " Thank you , dear . Roast lamb , one of my favorites , and you had Riesela fix it just the way I prefer it . " <p> If Mother had told the cook to fix lamb any other way , we all would have been treated to a long lecture on the glories of crisped roast lamb and the inadequacies of other preparations . <p> After pouring a heavier red wine into his goblet and then into Mother 's , Father placed the carafe before me . I took about a third of a goblet , because that was what he 'd declared as appropriate for me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carving and serving , Mother passed the rice casserole and the pickled beets . I took as little as I could of the beets . <p> " How was your day , dear ? " asked Mother . <p> " Oh . . . the same as any other , I suppose . The Phlanysh wool is softer than last year , and that means that Wurys will complain . Last year he said it was too stringy and tough , and that he 'd have to interweave with the Norinygan . . . and the finished Extelan gray is too light . . . But then he 's half Pharsi , and they quibble about everything . " <p> Mother nodded . " They 're different . They work hard . You ca n't complain about that , but they 're not our type . " <p> " No , they 're not , but he does pay in gold , and that means I have to listen . " <p> I managed to choke down the beets while Father offered another discourse on wool and the patterned weaving looms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was n't about to mention that the prettiest and brightest girl at the grammaire was Remaya , and she was Pharsi . <p> Abruptly , he looked at me . " You do n't seem terribly interested in what feeds you , Rhennthyl . " <p> " Sir . . . I was listening closely . You were pointing out that , while the pattern blocks used by the new weaving machinery produced a tighter thread weave , the women loom tenders have gotten more careless and that means that spoilage is up , which increases costs  --  " <p> " Enough . I know you listen , but I have great doubts that you care , or even appreciate what brings in the golds for this house hold . At times , I wonder if you do n't listen to the secret whispers of the Namer . " <p> " Chenkyr . . . " cautioned Mother . <p> Father sighed as only he could sigh . " Enough of that . What did you learn of interest at grammaire today ? " <p> It was n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about . " Father . . . lead is heavier than copper or silver . It 's even heavier than gold , but it 's cheaper . I thought you said that we used copper , silver , and gold for coins because they were heavier and harder for evil imagers to counterfeit . " <p> " That 's what I mean , Rhennthyl . " He sighed even more loudly . " You ask a question like that , but when I ask you to help in the counting house , you ca n't be bothered to work out the cost of an extra tariff of a copper . . . or work out the costs for guards on a summer consignment of bolts of Acoman prime wool to Nacliano . It is n't as though you had no head for figures , but you do not care to be accurate if something does n't interest you . What metals the Council uses for coins matters little if one has no coins to count . No matter how much a man likes his work , there will be parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You seem to think that everything should be pleasing or interesting . Life does n't oblige us in that fashion . " <p> " Do n't be that hard on the boy , Chenkyr . " Mother 's voice was patient . <p> " Not everyone is meant to be a factor . " <p> " His willfulness makes an ob look flexible , Maelyna . " <p> " Even the obdurates have their place . " <p> I could n't help thinking I 'd rather be an obdurate than a mal . Most people were malleables of one sort or another , changing their views or opinions whenever someone roared at them , like Father . <p> " Exactly ! " exclaimed Father . " As servants to imagers and little else . I do n't want one of my sons a lackey because he wo n't think about anything except what interests or pleases him . The world is n't a kind place for inflexible stubbornness and unthinking questioning . " <p> " How can a question be unthinking ? " I wanted to know . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father 's sigh was more like a roar . Then he glared at me . " When you ask a question to which you would already know the answer if you stopped to think , or when you ask a question to which no one knows the answer . In both cases , you 're wasting your time and someone else 's . " <p> " But how do I know when no one knows the answer if I do n't ask the question ? " <p> " Rhennthyl ! There you go again . Do you want to eat cold rice in the kitchen ? " <p> " No , sir . " <p> " Rousel , " said Father , pointedly avoiding looking in my direction , " how are you coming with your calculations and figures ? " <p> " Master Sesiphus says that I have a good head for figures . My last two examinations have been perfect . " <p> Of course they had been . What was so hard about adding up columns of numbers that never changed ? Or dividing them , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about numbers and anything else when no one was looking or checking on him . <p> I cut several more thin morsels of the lamb . It was good , especially the edge of the meat where the fat and seasonings were all crisped together . The wine was n't bad , either , but it was hard to sit there and listen to Father draw out Rousel . <p> Excerpted from Imager by L. E. MODESITT , JR . <p> Copyright 2009 by L. E.
