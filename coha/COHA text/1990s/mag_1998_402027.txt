Black Leads Former Klan Stron hold // At first glance , it seems little has changes in the former Ku Klux Klan stronghold of Stone Mountain , Ga . Reminders of the past loom everywhere , from the brick-paved sidewalk and quaint stores of Main Street to the souvenir confederate flags in local gift shops to the eerie sculpture of Southern Civil War icons that shadows its historic park . But the signs of change are there if you look . A Black man lounging with a White friend in a gazebo . A rainbow of children splashinh together in a neighborhood pool . Then there 's the most dramatic evidence of all : The striking figure of Chuck Burris presiding as the first Black mayor in this once-segregated town . With his own special brand of chutzpath , Burris is carving a new face on the City of Stone Mountain . " Do n't you think it would look better if it had me up there , too ?

Photograph // Only someone like Burrs could see the outrageous humor in something that once was a symbol of so much pain . But that 's characteristic of his style . His constituents say they respect him for concentrating on the future more than the past . He 's more concerned with building new sidewalks and facilities for youths than dwelling on historic wrongs . In fact , one of Burris first acts as mayor was to allocate funds to install sidewalks in a Black neighborhood called Shermantown , where children walked in the road to school . " Those people had been asking for sidewalks as long as I had been on the council , " he says . " So I told my public works director that would be the very first one , on Fourth Street . In six months , it was done . " The mayor has made improvements to local ball fields and parks , named a homestead exemption for seniors and cracked down on drugs . But perhaps just as importantly , he has changed the perception of a town once known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members lit a cross and proclaimed their 20th century rebirth on the mountain 's peak . The supremacist group held yearly Labor Day rallies there as recent as the early ' ' 80s , some residents say . The former City of Stone Mountain councilman defeated six-year incumbent Pat Wheeler for the mayoral seat in a low-turnout election , winning nearly half of the votes in the racially mixed city of 6,700 . With his win , Burris has become a worldwide icon of the possibilities for racial progress . His wife , Marcia Baird Burris , estimates they 've received about 1,000 congratulatory calls at home and another 1,000 at City Hall since Burris won the election . He 's received letters from as far away as Switzerland and Brazil . Elementary school pupils from a private Jewish school in Florida even traveled to Stone Mountain to deliver their well-wishes in person . " I would have thought out of all those phone calls and lets , at least a percentage would be negative , " he says . " But only received good wishes . I consider that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the press , appearing in national media such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and international publications in countries diverse as Japan , Great Britain and France.His wife , an 18-year public relations veteran , has taken on the role of this communications manager , fielding phone calls and arranging speaking engagements , interviews and appointments . The mayor has become an ambassador for the city 's changing image . Included among his plans to strengthen the economics of the area are restoring Main street ( construction on a sidewalk has already begun ) and enhancing the city 's cultural activities .

Burris sat with other distinguished guests of the Clintons during the State of the Union address earlier this year . He 's believed to be the first mayor of Stone Mountain ever so honored . " This is a small town , " Burris says . " I did n't think the mayorship would mean that much . I 'm still astounded and overwhelmed . " Marcia believes people have responded to her husband 's story because it gives hope in the face of rising racial tension . " His election came at a time when the Skinheads were doing stuff out West , " she says . " There were assaults on affirmative action and other racist acts . With that as the backdrop , many people around the world were saying , Wow , we just really needed some good news . " ' But Burris is no symbolic figurehead .

He juggles his private time with the simple gestures that me so much to the people he serves , such as speaking at churches or inaugurating Little League games . Burris says he never considered the long hours he 'd have to devote for such a small salary as a factor in whether he 'd run . " It was actually a huge increase , " he jokes . " As a councilman , I get paid $75 a month . But you ca n't be in it for the money . You have to9 be i it because it 's what you want to do . The rewards come when you see the kids eyes when they see the baseball field or when an elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired of seeing her community go down . That 's what this is all about ? Burris learned this lesson of self-sacrifice early while growing up in small-town Louisiana . His father , Seymour , was an elementary school principle , and his mother , Vermont , taught high school English . His parents spent their free time registering people to vote and participating in public-service projects with the NAACP . It was also in Louisiana that Burris had some of his earliest lessons about racism . He was just a child the night someone bnurned a cross on their lawn . " If you grew up in the South , you had experiences like that all through life , " says Burris , whose middle school was also the target of a cross-burning . " One of my first remembrances was my mother telling me about Emmett Till . She told me if the police ever tell you to stop , you run . And do n't you stop running until you get home .

At age 16 , he entered Morehouse College as a Merrill Scholar . While there , he heard lectures by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr . at a nearby church . He says he never forgot the civil rights leader 's lessons of nonviolence and making change from within . Burris became active in politics while still a Morehouse student , working for the vice mayoral campaign of Maynard Jackson and the congressional bid of Andrew Young . He entered John Marshall Law School in 1973 and after graduation began work in government , holding city and state positions Burris ' first memory of Stone Mountain involves a visit there for a fraternity picnic . But the next time he came it was not so joyous . He was on a date at the park when a White man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day 's paper . There was a Klan rally scheduled to begin that day in just 40 minutes . Burris took the warning and left the site , but that image stayed with him . When he moved to Stone Mountain years later , he decided to run for city council . Burris focused his campaign on the issues , testing new innovations to win votes such as putting out a newsletter he called " The Burris Report " and using an autodialing phone system to reach every Stone Mountain resident he could . The mayor says he wanted to run an upscale campaign absent of the petty barbs that candidates sometimes aim at each other . " I was impressed with him the first day I met him , " says White resident T. J. Weatherly , who has lived in Stone Mountain for nearly six decades . " He had charisma and confidence . He was well-educated . I decided to support him right then . " That was n't the only old-timer Burris won over . While campaigning door-todoor , Burris spied three elderly Whites sitting outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , then handed each a brochure . " You know Mr. Venable here , do n't you ? " one woman asked , gesturing to the old man with a shawl draped across his lap . Burris gazed at the frail man and noticed the cross branded on his cheek with sudden recognition . He remembered him from the broadcasts that had haunted the TV screens of his youth . He was standing in front of James Venable , the former imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan . The councilman-hopeful took a breath and launched into his pitch . He figured if he could win Venable over , he could convince anyone to vote for him . The elderly man cut in after finding out that Burris graduated from Morehouse College . " That 's a fine school , " Burris remembers him saying . " You know what , I 'm going to vote for you . " He agreed to let Burris put campaign signs on his lawn . " His daughter , Ginger , later told me that for some reason he liked me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of makes you want to check yourself . " Little did Burris know but that spot would come to mean even more to him . He became city councilman and met a woman at at local party who would later become his wife . As they searched for a home before their marriage , the real estate agent pulled up in front of the now-deceased Venable 's house . " I said , Marcia , do you know whose house that was ? ' When I told her the history , we told the agent we were n't interested , " he says . But fate had other plans . With just a moth left before they wed , they lost the bid on their first choice . " We got frantic , " Burris recalls . " We 'd see one house I 'd like and she 'd hate it or she 'd like it and I 'd hate it . One Sunday evening , the agent called Marcia and told her she found a house that hadd everything we were looking for right down to a Jacuzzi in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it was . When the agent told her the address , she just started laughing . Marcia called Burris and gave him the same spiel . They knew they were meant to have that house . " I said , " You know what ? God has a sense of humor , " Burris says , smiling . When they moved in , the roses around the house were in full bloom . Venable 's daughter , Ginger , commented they had n't bloomed in five years . " We took that as a positive signn , " says the mayor , who married in 1996 . Today , the spirit of love and Black culture fill the 150-year-old home . Africaan artifacts , sculptures that reflect Marcia 's Guyanese and Bajan heritage and prints by famous Black artists like Romare Bearden decorate corner nooks and walls . Along with his wife , the mayor lives with his 17-year-old stepdaighter , Dieynaba ( pronounced Jay-naba ) Johnson , and a zoo of pets , including three cats and a Rottweiler named Ito . The father of five gazes at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and says he sometimes wonders in amazement at how far he has come . Burris campaign volunteer Charles Wright compares the Stone Mountain of just a decade ago to the new diversity forming in the city today . " When I first moved here , I felt quite a bit of racial tension , " says the vice president of the Stone Mountain Dixie Youth Baseball Association . " It was the old cliche stuff . When you walked in a place you were followed , maybe not literally , but you could feel their eyes on every move you made . You could see people standing in the corner watching you . " The city is slowly changing , the man says , pointing to the different nationalities of children playing at a local ballpark . " I feel finally that the community and the City of Stone NMoutain are moving forward , " he says . " I think under Mayor Burris we are headed in the right direction . " Today , weeds cover the plot of land called Klan Hill , where white-hooded specters once burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' biggest supporters for his election as mayor were White . It amazed me how many of the oldtimers voted for him , " says the 70something Weatherly , who helped bolster support for Burris . " The Black vote turned out well , but he had to also win the White vote to be elected here . He listens , and he 's responsive to the citizens . He 's making a very good mayor . " Back at his house , Burris points to the framed caricature propped on a table of Dr. King floating above the summit of Stone Mountain with him standing at its base . He says he has felt the presence of the civil rights leader from his earliest days in the city . A mounted autograph and photograph of Dr. King was the first thing Burris brought into the house . The mayor recalls the night of his celebration party when one of his White Stone Mountain supporters invoked the reverend 's name and the time he asked in his " I Have a Dream " speech for freedom to ring from Stone Mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed . The White man asked everyone to be quiet , the mayor recalls . " Shhh , shhh , " he said . Ca n't you just hear Dr. King ringing that freedom bell from on top of Stone Mountain ?
