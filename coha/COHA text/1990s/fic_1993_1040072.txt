 | ultimate plan . " Keeping his arms spread , Mordecai moved his fingers , inviting a response . When none came , his brilliant smile faded . His face grew stern , lips tight and thin . " Lambs , " he said , " five more days ! Do n't it make you want to cry out in praise ? " From the back of the bus came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Praise Him " and " Hallelujah . " Walter Demming , who had n't been to church since he was fourteen , and even then had disliked public prayer , forced his lips to move , but he made no sound . Samuel Mordecai nodded his head . " Only five more days , you sweet Lambs of God . Smile . Open your mouths and praise the name of Him , oh Him , who is gon na cause wonders beyond the imagining and terrors also . The sun shall turn black like sackcloth made of goat hair , the whole moon shall turn blood red , and the stars in the sky shall fall to earth . The powers that are in heaven shall be shaken . " Our job is to prepare the way . You and me . We are the human agents for what is ripe . Now gather round for the lesson . " He started walking up the aisle toward them .

That 's the wonder He worked with me so I could be here to tell y'all and the rest of the world what is transpiring on this rebel planet . " The kids all moved like zombies to their seats . Walter knew it would be useless to try to talk to Mordecai now , when he was already rolling , so he sat , too , and resigned himself to waiting it out . " Now you recall , " Samuel Mordecai said , " we was talking about the signs that have given us to know that the end is at hand . They 're all here . You see ' em every day out in the world of so-called technology . Bar codes and credit cards , TV shopping , implants , transponders , electronic transfers , cyberspace , and those so-called computer games . It was all foretold in the Book of Revelation .

' " I told you yesterday that I would tell you something that will amaze you , Lambs . Now , I know most of you have had enough arithmetic so you can add pretty good . So follow along . In many languages there 's a code where letters of the alphabet are given numbers . Often in sixes . So A is six , B is twelve , C is eighteen , and so on . Now say we do that with our alphabet . Then we take the word computer ' and assign each letter in that word its number . Okay ? You following me , Lambs ? You know what that adds up to ? You know what number , of all the numbers in the world ,  | that makes ? " Samuel Mordecai looked around , his eyes wide and his breathing coming hard . " Do you know what computer ' equals ? " He waited , as if expecting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking their heads . " You 'd need pencil and paper to do the adding up , I guess . So I 'm gon na just tell you . " Mordecai paused again and his blue eyes were wide . " It adds up to six hundred and sixty-six . Six , six , six . Yes ! The number of the Beast from the Book of Revelation . Ai n't that just an amazing sign , Lambs ? Do n't that fill you with wonder ? Just think that when all those prophecies were made two thousand years ago , the prophet John , the disciple beloved of Jesus , who wrote the Book of Revelation , could foresee the computer . John said , If anyone has insight , let him calculate the number of the Beast , for it is man 's number . His number is 666 . ' Do n't that strike you with awe ? The letters in computer ' add up to " ? he held up six fingers and shook them in the air ? " six , six , six . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the thin voice droned on and on , he turned to check the children . All of them sat perfectly still as they watched Samuel Mordecai pacing the aisle . He held his book in his left hand and stabbed the air with his right index finger , the motion jerky and so aggressive it made Walter want to reach out and break the finger off . For the first week , he had tried to concentrate on these lessons so he could understand what Samuel Mordecai had in mind , but he soon discovered it was so crazy and repetitive he did n't need to listen . He pretended to listen , of course . He did n't want to anger the man . He looked directly at him , followed his movements with his eyes , but his mind he let float across the field of wildflowers that stretched from his house all the way to Theodora Shea 's gravel driveway where her sixteen-year-old golden retriever dozed in the sun and her garden awaited his attention and the earth awaited his hands . Today he would plant geraniums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sobbing brought him back . He looked over at her in the seat across from him . She was trying to hold it in , but an occasional sob escaped her . Samuel Mordecai was shouting . " But the cowardly , the unbelieving , the vile , the murderers , the sexually immoral , those who practice magic arts , the idolators and all liars  --  they will all be made into blood statues on the last day ! We got to go through the blood . Ca n't avoid it , ca n't go over it , ca n't go around it , got to go through it . If you reject the opportunity that is offered to you , woe unto you , for then you shall go to the place where the worm never dies . " Walter turned his head to check on the other kids . Bucky sat up  | straight with his hands folded in his lap . His eyes were shut so tight that his face was screwed up in a grimace . Philip 's head had sunk into his lap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five more days , Walter thought  --  five more days of this shit and we 'll all be praying for the world to end . 0 Lord , please help us  --  lately he found himself praying  --  him , a man who had n't prayed even in foxholes . Whatever is going to happen , he prayed , with his eyes squeezed shut to keep the tears in , please get this over with and see us safe through it . His stomach contracted in sharp hunger pangs . But first , dear Lord , You who loved little children and incompetent sinners like myself , we sure could use some breakfast here . Oh , we sure could .  | " Beyond telling you I 'm sick to death of it , I do n't know how to explain it , Richard , " Molly Cates said without turning away from the window . " Try . " Richard Dutton 's voice retained its habitual caustic edge , even though Molly knew he was making an effort to sound warm and understanding . She kept her eyes fixed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lunch-hour traffic twenty-one stories below . " When I first got the police beat at the Patriot , I thought it was the world 's luckiest break . I was eager for it all . Crime was an adventure , this alien subculture that sucked me in . Ever since then , for twenty-two years , I 've been a regular visitor to that place . " She felt the slither of dread deep in her chest . " Now I feel like a native there . " She turned around to see his reaction . The staff meeting at the Capitol Club was over , and the rest had gone back to the office , leaving Molly alone with her boss . Richard Dutton , the editor of Lone Star Monthly , sat with his chair pushed back from the mahogany table and stared down at his long legs stretched out in front of him . " I 've been thinking it 's time for me to get out of that world , " she said , her voice sounding whiny and uncertain in her ears . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more than twenty years . It 's starting to give me bad dreams . And this horror going on in Jezreel is ? " She stopped , at a loss for the end to the sentence . " Oh , Richard , I do n't even want to think about it . "  | " But you have been thinking about it , have n't you ? " He glanced up at her . " You are following the coverage . " " To avoid it you 'd have to leave the planet . " " I want to understand this , " he said . " Your reluctance here  --  is it because of your past unpleasantness with Samuel Mordecai ? " " Unpleasantness ! " Just like Richard to call the most unsettling event of her journalistic career an " unpleasantness . " " Let me remind you that when my cult story came out , Mordecai called and said if I did n't arrange network television time for him to respond , he would mark my soul with a bar code identifying me as one to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . For months I got preachy , barely literate letters from some of his followers who were trying to set me right . And I think he 's the one who put me on the mailing list for all those right-wing religious tracts , which I am still receiving . " She stopped because she was out of breath . Richard Dutton sat up straighter in his chair . " I hear you , Molly , and I can see how strongly you feel . But you should be able to see my point of view here , too . We 've got this huge story going on right in our own backyard , a story that has dominated national headlines for six weeks . The clock is ticking down on it . And we 're sitting here with an unfair advantage that we are n't using . Surely you can see that . " She shook her head . " We do n't have an unfair advantage . If anything , it 's more like a handicap . " He clucked his tongue . " You know better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country who 's met and interviewed Samuel Mordecai . The only one . You have a relationship with him ? " " Richard , " she interrupted , " Mordecai 's not someone you have a relationship with . Unless you 're willing to sit for five hours at a stretch and listen to his harangues . " " But you did talk to him  --  for several hours and ? " " Several hours that were the worst of my life . And I include , for comparative purposes , the time the anesthetic wore off while I was having knee surgery and the time I went to divorce court , " Dutton laughed . " Okay . But you 've already done the painful part here . You did the interview ; you might as well get something out of it . And , Molly , the fact that you hated him from the start , that you saw through him , gives you ? " " Richard ! " Molly had been trying to treat it lightly , but now she lost all pretense at humor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did see through him . I knew he was fanatical , and dangerous . I even suspected crimes were going on out there . When I left , I felt . . . contaminated . And what did I do ? I went to the sheriff , that bumbling old Bradford County sheriff , and  | told him I thought Samuel Mordecai and the Hearth Jezreelites were evil and might be breaking some laws . I told him I 'd felt threatened . " He asked how they 'd threatened me , and I said Mordecai had lectured and bullied me . The sheriff said it sounded like what Reverend Willard did to him every Sunday at First Baptist . Not pleasant , but not exactly against the law . " He patted me on the head and said , Now go on home , little lady , and leave this to me . I 'll check those folks out for you , sure enough , yes , ma'am . ' So I went home , good little lady that I am , and proceeded to write the story , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the main thing  --  meeting deadline , right ? " " That 's what we do , Molly . There 's no dishonor there . As for your other actions , they were blameless . You did what any good citizen would : You told the appropriate law-enforcement officials about your suspicions , right ? What more can you expect of yourself ? " Molly groaned . The subject of Samuel Mordecai had been a sore one from the moment she met him two years earlier , and in the weeks since the school bus hijacking , it had become so agonizing that she tried not to think about him . But Mordecai was everywhere  --  his face , his name , his words , assaulted her from every television screen , every radio , every newspaper . It was impossible to ignore him . Now , against her will , she saw his image : Samuel Mordecai , born Donnie Ray Grimes , standing in front of her , running his long , graceful fingers through his sun-streaked blond curls as he ranted about computers and calamity , beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches of hell . She had not gotten him to answer a single question . He just opened his mouth and started preaching , preaching and strutting , as if that was what she had come for . He gushed words at her nonstop , incoherently , ungrammatically , spewing them all over her . She made one or two feeble attempts to stop him , but on he raved . She had felt trapped and abused and mesmerized by the droning male voice that had kept her pinned to her chair far past the time she should have gotten up and walked out . There were things about that interview that still haunted her , things she had never told anyone . Finally , after enduring two hours of it , she had pushed her way out of the room and driven away from Jezreel convinced the man was dangerous . " Molly , " Richard said , " Molly , when your boss asks you a civil question , it 's customary to answer him . I asked you what more could you expect of yourself ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more could be expected . " " Good . Now here 's a problem : I get a dozen calls a day from editors  | and writers around the country who read your cult story and want to talk with you . They tell me they 've tried to reach you , but you wo n't return their calls . " She had been afraid this was coming . " I know . I 'm sorry about that , but I 've been busy . And I did n't want to talk about it . " " I can see that . And if you want , I 'll continue to field the calls so you can work . Now , I know this is distasteful , but I 'd like to encourage you to go ahead and write this story . Most of your homework for it is already done . All you need to do , really , is trot out your old interview tapes and listen to them in light of what 's happened . You know how that works . You 'll get interested again , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up . You 'll find some quotes and material you did n't use the first time . You can show how prophetic you were . You can follow the news as it breaks . Hell , you 're doing it anyway . So just watch whatever is going to happen out there in the next five days , and write your story . You do n't even need to go to Jezreel if you do n't want to . I hear it 's a madhouse , anyway . Just watch it all on CNN . You can do it without breaking a sweat . " " Oh , no , I ca n't . " She held a hand out to him with the palm turned up . " Feel . It makes me sweat just to talk about it . " Richard Dutton leaned forward and rested his fingers on her damp palm . Then he looked up at her with interest . " I am amazed , " he said . " I 've seen you talking to serial rapists and crazed killers without batting an eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm not sure , " she said , knowing even as she replied that this was only half true . " He 's a lunatic , but , as you say , I 've known lots of lunatics , and none of them made my hands sweat . " She lowered her voice because she was embarrassed by what she was about to say . " It has to do maybe with a certain power he has . Charisma . Energy . I do n't know . You have to see it . " Richard leaned forward , watching her , his small deep-set eyes glowing amber the way they did when he was excited . " Just how crazy do you think Mordecai is , Molly ? " The image of him pacing the room , shouting and grabbing at his crotch as he preached , flashed before her . " Stark raving bonkers , " she said . " Crazy enough to ? " That old feeling of dread and disgust squeezed her stomach . " Crazy enough to do something like what happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " She shook her head vigorously . " I do n't want to have anything more to do with this , Richard . It 's not good for me . " Molly turned back to the window and rested her forehead against the cold plate glass . She looked down at the trail that edged Town Lake  | and the lunch-hour joggers  --  tiny figures sweating it out in the midday sun so many stories below . So silly , so futile , all that . As if exercising your cardiovascular system would keep calamity at bay , as if the world were a safe place , as if we were n't all vulnerable at every breath to the random viciousness loose in it . " Molly , " Richard 's voice sounded genuinely soft now , " for me this is not really about getting the story covered . Anyone on the staff could do it , and most of them would give their right arm to . But as your editor ? and friend  --  I have a vested interest in your career . There are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm aware of who has written a big breakthrough piece that vaulted her to national attention has been able to do it because of timing . It just happened that the perfect story , the very story that writer had been preparing to write all her life , came along at the exact right time , when she was primed and ready for it . That 's what 's happening here , Molly . Everything you have done up to now has been preparation for this one story . Surely you see that . " " Richard ? " " Just let me finish . Look at the choices you 've made . You cut your teeth on street crime covering the police beat . When you came to the magazine , you gravitated to the more bizarre and high-profile crimes we tend to take on . You 've been working a vein , I think  --  going after that dark strain , that attraction to violence we all feel but do n't like to admit . And your other specialty  --  and this surprised me at first , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially our own homegrown religious extremists . " He picked up a folded magazine from his stack on the table . " Listen . Some of your best work has been on this subject . " He began to read from the magazine : " These freelance prophets flourish in Texas , as they did centuries ago in Palestine , springing up out of the sun-dried earth like mesquite , tough and tenacious as hell . They preach a gospel heavy on prophecy and apocalypse , spouting the Book of Revelation as if they had drunk it in with their mother 's milk . The intensity of their charisma and their eschatology kindles in their followers a belief so passionate that it sometimes bursts into spontaneous combustion and consumes everything around it . Prophets are as native to Texas as longhorns and Stetsons . ' " Molly had to smile . It was from her piece on Texas cults . Usually it made her uncomfortable to hear something she 'd written in the past read aloud , but those words still pleased her . Richard slapped the magazine against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lifetime , Molly . You could win a Pulitzer . " He  | lowered his voice . " You really could . And do n't tell me that does n't appeal to you . " " Of course it does . The prizes are hard cash , and , as usual , I need some . " " There could be a book in it , too . " He rubbed his thumb and index finger together . She sighed . " Yeah , but the problem is I do n't even want to write a postcard about it . Just thinking about it makes me queasy . " " Maybe what 's making your stomach queasy and your palms sweaty is something else , Molly . " He lowered his eyes back to the tassels on his loafers . " Maybe it 's fear . You recognize this story as the incredible opportunity it is  --  I know you do . Maybe it 's that old female bugaboo rearing its ugly head  --  fear of success . " She leaned her shoulder against the window and thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel a lot like fear . But success , by almost any definition , was something she had always wanted , wholeheartedly , unabashedly . Fame , money , recognition  --  she coveted them all . She deserved them and she wanted them . No , it was n't success she feared . But she was afraid . She just was n't sure what she was afraid of . " Once you get going on it , Molly , " Richard said in his most enthusiastic voice , " your old instincts will take over . Trust me . " Amazingly , she did trust him . He was a great editor with an unerring instinct for the heart of a story . And he had always had the ability to get her excited about things . Maybe this fear or timidity or repugnance or whatever it was would pass and the old thrill and obsession of pursuing a good story would take over . Maybe this was the story she 'd been training for all her life . " And , Molly , " he added brightly , " how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She smiled . " Only once . And you 'd better meet deadline . " " And get paid up front , " he said . " Here 's my suggestion . Do this story . Give it your all , and when it 's over , take a leave for a few months . Start another book , take up golf , go to Paris . But now is the time to do this story . " She hesitated . Maybe . Maybe it was the perfect ending to her career in writing crime . " If I do this , Richard , will you help me move on to other subjects ? This may sound corny to you , but I really want to do things with more social significance than serial killers and nutty fringe religions . " He nodded . " If you still feel that way when you finish this , yes . This piece you suggested " ? he looked down at his notes on the table ? " these bag ladies . They 'll still be with us next month , wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the table and stuff them into her briefcase . She knew he was watching expectantly from under lowered lids , but she did n't say anything . Finally he said , " So , I 'll expect something brilliant on Samuel Mordecai and the Hearth Jezreelites by the twenty-ninth . " " Can I have ten pages for the homeless women in July and can I have Henry Iglesias for the photos ? " " Henry ? He costs too much . " " That 's because he 's the best . Wait till you see what we come up with , Richard . You 'll love it . " He studied her briefly . " Okay , " he said . " Then I can count on you for the Jezreelites ? " Molly closed her briefcase . " Sure . " " You wo n't be sorry . This will be a huge story . Catch Mordecai 's grandmother . Let 's see where he grew up . And the bus driver . He 's a Vietnam vet . What 's his story ? Maybe you can contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I had Brenda Natalini start some research for you . It should be on your desk . " She turned and looked at him with raised eyebrows . " Well , " he said , " I knew you 'd want to hit the ground running . And Brenda lucked onto something that might be interesting . Apparently there 's an old Vietnam buddy of Demming 's who lives in town . Maybe you could chat him up , try to get a feel for what Demming is like . " " You speak about him in the present tense . " Richard looked up at her , surprised . " I do n't think they 're dead . Do you ? " Molly felt the squeezing in her stomach again . " No . " She started toward the door , then stopped . " I 'm interested in getting into the theology behind Mordecai . What he believes is something of a mystery even though he talks about it all the time . Even his followers are n't sure what the message is . They say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've gotten a lead on an apocalyptic scholar who had a run-in with him a few years ago . " " Molly ! You 've already started working on it ! " " Yes . I have actually . " She gave him a smile more full of rue than humor . She stopped in the doorway and looked back at him . " Richard , if you knew Samuel Mordecai was right and the world really was going to end in five days , would you have come to work today ? " He looked up at her with narrowed eyes for several seconds before answering . " Hmm , five days . Well , that would mean the May issue would never come out , so there would be no point in planning for it . " He  | grinned . " And five days would n't give us time to get a special glossy end-of-the-world issue out . But I think I might come in anyway you know , to talk about it , rant and complain . I 'd probably tell everyone to look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes are due . What about you , Molly ? " " Well , if the world really was going to end and Samuel Mordecai had predicted it , I guess I 'd do exactly what I 'm about to do  --  find out more about him and his message , sniff around the edges of belief the way I tend to do . It reminds me of what someone said should be written over the door of every church . " Richard was busy organizing his papers . " And what 's that ? " he asked in a bored voice . " Important , if true . ' " He looked up . " Well , if it is true , nonbelievers like ourselves are in deep shit . " She left thinking we might all be in deep shit anyway .  | The radio in her pickup was tuned to NPR , and the subject was the Hearth Jezreelites . Her instinct was to switch it off and drive in silence , but she could n't make her hand reach for the button . Instead she clutched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for forty-six days , ever since the bus hijacking . She did n't want to listen to the radio news updates as she drove around town , but she did . She did n't want to watch the news on television , but she did  --  every night , at six and ten , and sometimes in between on CNN . She did n't want to read about it in the papers , but she did read it , every word in three papers  --  the Austin American-Patriot , the New York Times , and the Dallas Morning News . Everywhere she went there was a TV or radio blaring and people were talking about it . There was no escaping it . Richard was right  --  fate had come knocking on her door . But right now she felt besieged by it , as though fate were using a battering ram . She had first heard about it like this , in her truck , as she headed to the office on the morning of February 24 . A news bulletin came on : A band of religious extremists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty miles northeast of Austin , had hijacked a school bus containing seventeen children on their way to the Joseph B. Carruth Elementary School . Molly had felt an instant rush of hot dread . The cult had to be the Hearth Jezreelites , and the leader had to be Samuel Mordecai . She remembered them all too well .  | That evening some of the details had emerged on the news . Eight or nine men with rifles had stopped the bus on a rural road . They had surrounded it and dragged the driver off . Then they had boarded the bus and gone from child to child asking each one his name and age and the ages of his brothers and sisters . Six of the children had then been taken off the bus and told to lie face-down in a field . The other eleven were kept on the bus and the driver was forced to get back on and drive the bus away . The children who were left behind on the road flagged down a motorist . All were badly frightened but uninjured . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked them to tape what he was about to say . First he announced that he had brought the eleven children to his compound near Jezreel , where he and his followers worshiped God and awaited the Apocalypse . In doing this , he was simply following God 's orders . The children 's parents would be upset , he said , but in time they would come to understand the great honor of having their children chosen to advance God 's pur-pose . He said federal agents and local law authorities should know that the second anyone set foot on Jezreelite property the children would be killed . He and his avenger angels were well armed and could repel any attack , but the first thing that would happen in that event would be the immediate destruction of the children and the bus driver . He then announced that he , the Prophet Mordecai , was about to deliver the most important news anyone would ever hear : The world was going to end in fifty days , on April 14 . There was still time to listen to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered a rambling sermon about worldly corruption , the computer as the Beast of Revelation , and biblical prophecies . Over the last forty-five days excerpts from that sermon had been played and replayed hundreds of times around the world . Today NPR 's Lyle Baker was interviewing Thelma Bassett , the mother of one of the hostage children . Mrs. Bassett had emerged as the informal spokesperson for the parents . Molly had seen her interviewed several times on the TV news . As she listened to the soft twang , Molly could picture her  --  a rawboned young woman with limp pinkish hair and freckled milky skin . From photographs , it looked as if her eleven-yearold daughter , Kimberly , had inherited the same pink hair . Thelma Bassett was saying that she had asked the FBI to let her and some of the other parents talk to Samuel Mordecai directly . But the FBI had put her off , explaining that their highly trained hostage-negotiating team was currently in the middle of some extremely delicate discussions , and this was not the time for amateurs to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thelma Bassett drawled , " that Mr. Lattimore and the gentlemen in charge out there at Jezreel are the professionals , and I know they 've been working real hard , night and day , to try to help our children . But it has been forty-six days , Mr. Baker , and we parents are craving some word of our babies . I 'm just an average citizen , you know , a working woman , a mother , but I believe if I had the chance to talk to Mr. Mordecai from a mother 's heart , I might have an inside track at swaying him some . " Molly had always been amazed at how fearless and articulate average citizens could be when they spoke to the media , and Mrs. Bassett was one of the best , natural and persuasive . " Mrs. Bassett , what would you say to Samuel Mordecai if the FBI did let you speak to him ? " Lyle Baker asked . " Well , Mr. Baker , first of all I 'd tell him how much we parents miss our young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've read that Samuel Mordecai had a difficult childhood , that his mother had lots of problems and he was raised by his grandmother . I 'm sure sorry about that . Also , I do n't believe he has any children of his own , so maybe he has n't had the opportunity to understand how much we parents love our children and how devastated we are without them . He may not know that we ca n't sleep at night wondering . . . worrying that ? " She choked , as if she 'd suddenly gotten something caught in her throat . There were several ticks of silence before she resumed . " We have n't seen them or heard their voices in all this time and . . . we do n't even know whether ... " In his smooth radio voice , Lyle Baker said , " Tell us a little about Kimberly . " " Oh , my , " said Thelma Bassett , " Kimberly . Well , she 's eleven now , in the fifth grade , doing real well , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading and writing these days . She 's had some trouble with mathematics  --  long division , fractions , but then so did I. It 's in the genes maybe . " She let out a half-laugh which choked off abruptly . After some deep breaths , she began again . " Now , all I 'm asking for is a chance to speak to him . I believe that sometimes experts like the negotiators who are out there talking on their phones all the time , I believe they can lose sight of some of the emotions involved , and I believe that 's what I could add here  --  I could talk emotions to Mr. Mordecai . I 'd like to tell him that I do n't know about all this apocalypse business  --  I ' 11 leave that to him , and to God  --  but I do know that it 's not right to separate children from their parents . Even if the world was ending it 's not right . Especially if the world was ending . " " And there are the health problems the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . That is definitely something I want to talk to Mr. Mordecai about  --  the little boy , Joshua Benderson , who suffers from asthma . I believe if Mr. Mordecai knew how dangerous his condition is , to be without his medication , and in a stressful situation to boot , well , I believe he would let Joshua come out right now . " Now , what I really want " ? her voice turned tougher , matter-of-fact ? " is not just to talk on the phone , but to walk into that compound today , and talk face to face with Mr. Mordecai . I do n't fear for my own safety . I would be happy to release the government and everybody else from any responsibility for me  --  I 'd sign anything . All I want , Mr. Baker , is to walk in there , just as a private citizen , a mother . I want to talk to Samuel Mordecai . I want to see Kim and the other children . Kim 's best friend , Lucy , is in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with grief and worry they do n't leave their house any more . " All I want is to see them , to try to help , or , if worse comes to worst . . . I want to be there with them at the end , to share their fate , whatever it is . " Molly felt the woman 's anguish right down to her toenails . Even the interviewer sounded choked up as he thanked her and said that the FBI spokesman , Patrick Lattimore , had not been available to comment to the press about Mrs. Bassett 's offer . Molly turned off Rio Grande into the parking garage and squinted up into the shadows . She hated parking garages and avoided them whenever possible . This one was the worst  --  dark and so low-ceilinged she felt the need to hunch her head down into her shoulders every time she drove through . A loud fan unit made an unpleasant racket , and the ramp curved upward so sharply that twice she had scraped the tail of her pickup . If there had been any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never set foot in this garage . She pulled into her reserved space and took the elevator to a suite on the third floor where Lone Star Monthly had recently moved its offices , having come up in the world from the old second-floor walk-up on Brazos . Molly hated the new office because it had a marble lobby and elevators that made you feel you should be wearing panty hose . On her desk lay a stack of phone messages and a manila folder with the name Walter Demming typed on the tab . Molly sat down and opened it . On top was the UPI photograph that had been in the Patriot the day after the bus had been taken by the Jezreelites . It showed a thick-chested middle-aged man dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans . He wore wirerimmed glasses , and his graying hair was pulled back into a stubby ponytail . A solid-looking man , dependable . For the kids ' sake , she hoped so .  | Under his photo were small school-type photos of five of the children smiling self-consciously into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't want to get involved with them . Before she could read the file , the phone rang . She picked it up . " Molly Cates . " " Hello , my dear , Sister Addie here . " The voice was so sweet and positive , so sugary , that each time she heard it , Molly 's first impulse was to hang up . There was no way she could have anything in this world in common with the owner of such a voice . " Hey , Addie , " she said . " Any luck ? " " Finally . It took some doing , but I found him . He just got back from a year 's sabbatical , studying prophecy in Jerusalem . That 's why I had n't been able to get him . I found him at home , unpacking . Crotchety and jet-lagged . " " Did you ask him about it ? " " I surely did . He 'd heard the news over there , but only the bare outlines of it . " " Is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mordecai was several years back at the Southwest Prophecy Conference , but it 's a real sore subject with him and he hates to talk about it . Also , he 's scared , says Mordecai threatened him . " " Did you tell him he needs to get in touch with the FBI negotia-tors ? " " Yes , but he resisted . He does n't much like the federal government . " " Neither do I. I hope you leaned on him . " " Oh , yes . I said if he did n't call them today and volunteer this information , I 'd do it . He 's just the sort the FBI ought to be talking with , not those Harvard Ph.D . theologians they 've been consulting . Mr. Mordecai is light-years away from any mentality those consultants can get inside of . What they need is a Gerald Asquith . " " Is n't he a Ph.D. , too ? " Addie laughed . " I believe his degree is an honorary one from the West Central Texas Bible College , or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the kind of fundamentalist preacher the negotiators need if they 're going to get into the mind-set of a Samuel Mordecai . Asquith despises Mordecai , but he 's much closer to him in worldview than those intellectuals who have been advising them . Closer to the lunatic fringe . " " Did you ask him about this Rapture of Mordecai business ? " There was a long silence , during which Molly could hear the click of knitting needles . " Maybe it 's better for you to talk to Dr. Asquith your-  | self , sister , rather than have me filter it through my misperceptions and bad hearing . " Molly felt it  --  the pulsing of hot dread she 'd had in her chest since this thing began . " You do n't want to be the bearer of bad news . " " My dear , I 'm accustomed to bearing a great deal of bad news ? unfortunately . It 's not that . It 's just ? " She stopped . Molly was not about to let her get off the hook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how I am . A woman of ignorant and superstitious leanings . I guess I just do n't want to form these particular words . You see I have this . . . Oh , I should tell it to a shrink , sister , not burden you with it . " " Go ahead . Burden me . " " Dr. Asquith says the Rapture of Mordecai is a secret oral tradition passed from one Mordecai to the next . They all have visions  --  that 's what they call the rapture , and their doctrine they call the Heaven in Earth Vatic Gospel of the Jezreelite . It 's never been written down . It 's forbidden to write it down . Samuel Mordecai believes he is the latest and the last of this line . " " What is the doctrine , Addie ? " " I do n't know , and if Dr. Asquith knows , he 's not saying . But it has something to do with the need for human action in starting the Apoca-lypse . " " What sort of action ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct line know , but that it 's heresy and gives prophecy a bad name . He says Mordecai makes his religion up as he goes . He drafted a bill of censure to get Mordecai censured by the Council of Bible Prophecy , and that 's the flap I was remembering . " " Did the Council censure him ? " " No . Mordecai resigned from the Council before they took it up . That 's why they do n't have a record . Dr. Asquith says Mordecai is a dangerous extremist , and that is impressive coming from a man who preaches that earthquakes are the result of gay rights demonstrations . If Mordecai had n't resigned , Asquith would have pursued him to the ends of the earth , he says . " " Well , sounds like Dr. Asquith has some spine . It 's a good thing somebody does . " " My dear girl , give yourself a break . The world is chock-full of little pockets of wickedness and nitwittery , like boils just waiting to break open and spill out their poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see more of these boils than folks usually do . So we know they are there , but , sister ,  | we are just frail creatures of very limited vision . We have no way of predicting which ones will burst open and which will not . " Molly glanced down at the newspaper photos of Walter Demming and the five children . One of them was a very small dark-haired boy with a cowlick standing straight up like a patch of weeds . Bucky DeCarlo , age six . " Oh , Addie . I knew this particular boil was festering . I had a strong hunch it would break . But I let it go . " " Molly , my dear . You could n't have known . If you feel responsible for the actions of every lunatic you 've ever met , you 'll go crazy yourself . What did you decide at your meeting ? Are you going to write about this ? " " Yes . " The click of the needles stopped . " I wonder if that is the best thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Addie . I wonder , too . My editor thinks this is the story I 've been preparing to write all my life . " " Well , maybe so . Maybe so . But what we prepare for in this life is not always what we ought to be doing . Now , I do n't know what 's right for you , my dear , but when I see a friend burst into tears when the television news comes on , it makes me think ? " " I was tired . I watch the news all the time without crying , Addie . " " Well , I 'm sure you do . But I suspect you might need some time off . How about a rest at our church retreat in the hill country ? " " Thanks , Addie , maybe when I finish this . Is there any hope Dr. Asquith has anything in writing about this Rapture of Mordecai stuff ? " " He says he 'll look for the notes he used to write the bill of censure . But remember , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to call him , Addie . " " I know . I told him and he said he 'd be doing his radio show tonight ? Prophecies in the Media . You should listen to it sometime . Station KLTX at seven . " After Addie gave her Gerald Asquith 's phone number , Molly hung up and sat back in her chair thinking about the next step . She looked at the file on her desk . Under the picture , there was just one sheet with a few typed lines giving the Austin address for a man named Jacob Alesky , who was an old friend of Walter Demming , a buddy from Vietnam . Molly stuck the folder in her briefcase . She 'd follow that up this afternoon if time permitted , but for now she needed to force herself to do what she had been putting off . She needed to get out her two-year-old taped interview with Samuel Mordecai and listen to it . To refresh her memory so she could try to get back inside his head  --  something no one in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about to do it .  | She found on her key ring the small brass key that opened her desk file drawer . Inside were boxes of neatly labeled and dated audiotapesall the interviews she had done over the ten years she had worked for Lone Star Monthly . Writers were required to keep notes and tapes for only two years , but she held on to hers much longer . Her hand went immediately to the ones she was looking for  --  the ones marked Samuel Mordecai I and Samuel Mordecai II . She put them on the desk and then rummaged through her bag for the tiny Sony recorder that she always carried . Before she found it , her phone rang again . It was Stephanie in the front office . " There 's a Thelma Bassett here to see you , Molly . " It took several seconds for the name to register . Oh , God . The mother , from the radio this morning . Molly 's first impulse was to run . What did she want ? Whatever it was , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy or just leaving . She really did n't have time or energy for this woman . On the other hand , this was part of her story ; sooner or later she 'd want to talk to some parents . And from what she 'd seen and heard , Mrs. Bassett was the best of the lot . " Okay . Send her back , " Molly said . She stood in the office doorway to wait for her . The woman appeared in the hall . She was nearly six feet tall , with broad shoulders and hips . She wore clogs and a blue denim shirtwaist dress with a silver concha belt . Her pinkish hair swayed with every move she made . Over one shoulder hung a huge canvas tote bag that looked so heavy Molly was sure she must be carrying all her files around with her  --  a mark of obsession . People who carry their files with them are either truly obsessed or truly terrified , or both . She knew this because there had been times in her life when she carried files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm Molly Cates . " She held out her hand . The woman clasped it in both of hers . Her eyes were a light khaki color that matched her freckles . " Thanks for seeing me without an appointment and all . Do you have a few minutes to talk ? " " Sure . Come on in . " Molly led the way and gestured to the chair in front of the desk . Thelma Bassett dropped her bag with a thump . As she lowered herself into the chair , she let her eyes close for a moment . The woman was terminally exhausted , Molly thought . " I heard you on NPR this morning , " Molly told her . " I have a daughter , too , and I ca n't imagine anything worse than what you are going through . I 'm so sorry . " The tan-colored eyes pooled with tears , but the woman looked determined not to let them fall . " Did you get any response from the FBI ? " Molly asked .  | " No . Not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came to see you , actually . To ask you a favor . " Molly sat in the chair across from her . " Well , go ahead . " " I believe Pat Lattimore and Andrew Stein are at the end of their rope  --  tired and discouraged . " " They sure have been looking that way on the news every night . " " I do n't fault them . They have tried everything and consulted everyone who claims to know anything about how to do this . Have you been out there to the command post ? " Molly shook her head . " Well , you ca n't imagine what it 's like until you see it . They 've got people coming in from all over the world  --  psychologists and psycholinguists and Bible experts and ministers and policemen and people who have been hostages and some men who teach about rescuing hostages at that FBI school up in Virginia . They 've even got this psychic woman who wears a turban . But nothing works . Nothing . He just sermonizes and recites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are desperate enough to try something different . " She leaned forward . " I think they 're fixing to let me talk to him . " Molly must have looked skeptical , because Thelma became defensive . " Really . I have good reason to think that . Patrick has asked me what I would say if they let me talk to him on the phone . And they look at me like they 're sizing me up . I can see them thinking : Will she break down or can she carry it off ? " Molly nodded . " I just read your article , " Thelma said , " the one you wrote last year ? Texas Cult Culture . ' I stayed up late last night reading it . " Molly did n't like to think about this woman sitting up in bed reading about the crazy zealotry of a man who was now in control of her daugh-ter 's fate . No wonder she looked so tired . " What interested me most , " Thelma continued , " was you mentioning that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think was the word you used , for women that went back to problems with his mother . " Molly nodded . Where was this going ? " My friend says she heard you talk one time , and you said you do lots more interviewing than you use in writing , and that you tape-record everything . " " Yes . " Molly felt increasingly uneasy at the direction this was taking . " Did you do that when you interviewed Samuel Mordecai  --  taperecord everything ? " " Yes . " Thelma Bassett leaned forward . " Here 's the thing . I want to prepare  | myself for when I talk to him . You must think this is a pipe dream , but I know it 's going to happen . I want to make the most of it when my chance comes because it may be the only chance . " A red flush darkened her cheeks . " I need to know what to say to him , how to sway him , how to get him to let those kids come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work . I 'm afraid they 're fixing to attack the compound . I have a feeling about this . If I hear his voice and get to know him some ahead of time , it might help me to say the right thing . " Her eyes demanded a response from Molly . " Mrs. Bassett , I would love to help you , but if you 're thinking about my tapes , that 's impossible . " Thelma Bassett sat back as if stung . " Why ? " " Because they do n't belong to me ; they belong to the magazine . " Molly was n't actually sure that was true . She must have read the contract when she signed it , but she could n't remember what the deal was . " Anyway , there 's nothing in those tapes that will help you . " She did n't say that there was another reason : she could n't bear to have anyone else listen to them . Her interview with Samuel Mordecai had been a low point in her career , an embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what she heard in those tapes would just scare this poor mother out of her wits . No , this was a bad idea . " It would be a waste of your time . " " You 're afraid it will upset me , " Thelma said , reading Molly 's mind . " I appreciate that , but I already know he 's a madman . Even madmen have some areas where you can get through to them . See , I have this feeling . . . Oh , it sounds crazy and big-talking , but I think I 'm the one who can do this . I really do . " Her eyes locked on to Molly 's . " Please help me . " Molly felt the appeal down to her toes . The woman was in the grip of a cause and it was catching . Shit . " Well , I . .. " " Does he talk about his mother on this tape ? " Molly tried to remember . " Some , but not much , I think . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know . Molly , I 've got this feeling . I taped that talk he did on the radio the first day and I 've listened to it again and again . One of the things he keeps coming back to is how bad mothers are today , how no one should have children because the corruption of society has made mothering impossible . I want to hear what he said to you about those things : I think this is what I should talk to him about . " " This really is n't my decision , " Molly said , hoping Thelma Bassett would just go away . " The tapes are not my property . I could talk to my boss tomorrow and ? "  | " There 's no time . I need to be ready . Please . Please do this for me , for the kids . Listen with me so you can tell me what he looked like , what he was doing when he said certain things . I would n't pester you like this , except I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly found herself desperately searching for a way out of this . It would be like letting someone go through your garbage . Thelma continued : " If you absolutely need to check with your boss , call him now . It 's an emergency situation  --  we 've only got five more days . Tell him there might just be some little thing that could help , could make a difference for our children . Please . " She was relentless , and shameless  --  exactly the way Molly would be in her circumstances . Molly sat looking at the tapes . She stood up . " I 'll see if I can get him . But I do n't know . . . " She walked to her desk phone , punched 21 for Richard 's office , and hoped he was n't there . But he picked up the phone himself on the first ring . " Richard , Thelma Bassett is here in my office . She feels she may get a chance to talk with Mordecai and she wants to listen to the tapes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapes belong to the magazine and that ? " " My God , Molly , I saw her on television . She 's wonderful . Get to know her . Give her anything she wants . " " But what about the confidentiality of ? " " Molly , if she wants to hear them , let her . " " Right , " Molly said , putting the phone down . " Okay , " she said to Thelma , who was literally sitting on the edge of her chair . " I think there 's about an hour and a half of tape here . Do you have time now ? " " I 'll make time . Thank you . " Thelma 's hands were pressed together as if in prayer . Molly slipped the first tape into the player . But she did n't start it . " I want to explain something , Thelma . This is the worst interview I ever did . It 's not really an interview . He just talks on and on , and for some reason I was unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Well , you 'll see . " She pushed the " play " button . The tape started with the usual static and thumps of setting up . Her own voice came on , too loud . She adjusted the volume , grimacing , as she did every time she heard her recorded voice . On the tape she was asking about talking to some of the other cult members , especially some of the women . Before she had gotten the question out , however , Samuel Mordecai 's twangy drawl took over : " Our women keep very busy here at Jezreel , you can probably see that walking through the grounds . Time spent in idle conversation is time not given over to praising the Lord or getting His work done . This is not ? "  | " Just a few minutes is all it would take . Maybe your wife would ? " " I told you , " he said in a louder voice , " they are busy . You said you wanted to interview me . Here I am . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The life-affirming jobs , Miz Cates , what women are best at . They provide our food and they clean our home and they work in the garden and they also work on our construction project you saw coming in . And they train for defense , just like the men . And they study the Bible with me many hours every day  --  that is the most important thing we all do here at Jezreel  --  studying the word of God and preparing ourselves . " " Defense ? How do they ? " " That is something we wo n't discuss today . Let me just say we are armed and able to defend ourselves fully against any attack from outside forces . " " Outside forces ? Who would want to ? " " Do n't be naive , Miz Cates . You know very well that agents and forces of our corrupt monster central government have been spying on us for years , looking for any excuse to attack us , just like they did to those folks in Waco . All I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . We are more ready than they were in Waco . And , like I said , even our women do their fair share . They are occupied and I speak for them . " " What about the children ? " Molly 's voice persisted . " You did n't mention ? " " There are no children here . " " But many of the women here are young , of ? " " Abstinence ! Have n't you ever heard of abstinence , Miz Cates ? Chastity . Why bring children into the world when the world is about to end ? ' And woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days . ' Matthew 24:19 , Miz Cates . " Mordecai laughed , and hearing it now , Molly cringed . " A child born today would not even learn to walk and talk before the end . Earth 's probation is being terminated , and we will witness it all . Our period of troubles and tribulation is ending . " Time is rushing to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It do n't sound like the flapping of angel wings , oh no . You can hear it in the squawky sounds of television and movies and rock videos , in the whir of monster computers running the world 's business . You can hear it every time a credit card goes through one of them charge machines  --  ka-chunk ? every time a bar code gets read by one of them machines they got in grocery stores  --  zit , zit . It 's all around us , zooming around our heads , through our heads  --  radio waves and microwaves , Fuzzbusters and cellular phones , modems , satellite transmissions bouncing around , electrical  | wires everywhere , making foreign masses grow in our bodies , electronic spying devices , telephone bugs . Ca n't you hear it in the air ? All that speed and so-called progress is the sound of time rushing to its final conclusion . I call it rapidation , ' Miz Cates , rapidation . Just like Daniel prophesied twenty-five hundred years ago , Many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have you noticed how everything gets faster every year ? New computer chips calculate faster than the eye can see , airplanes break the sound barrier . It 's the speeding up of time , and it was prophesied as a signpost to the end . " His voice had been building in volume and now it rose to a fierce crescendo : " All this rapidation , this running to and fro , is revving up the Apocalypse . " Underneath the relentless flow of words on the tape were the faint , yippy sounds of Molly trying to get a question in , but his mad words boiled over hers . " And now we know it 's really at hand , real soon , next year , in the spring . Next spring is when it will all finish , all the rushing madness , Miz Cates . It is coming to pass , just as it was prophesied by Ezekiel and Daniel and John . It 's all written in Scripture , predicted over two thousand years ago  --  the earthquakes , the lawlessness and violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wars and rumors of wars , the reign of the Beast , who lives here among us . The great battle of Armageddon is coming , the Millennium , and the Judgment Day . Just read the newspaper , Miz Cates . It 's all coming and we here at Jezreel are the key . It can not happen without us . That is why I let you come in here . That is why I am talking to you . I want you to write that in your magazine . It is your job to tell it to the world . We here at Jezreel are the human agents who will spark it off . " At last Molly 's voice broke through , almost yelling . " My job is to tell the truth as I see it and I need to talk with some of your members , a few women , some children , and ? " " Miz Cates , open your ears and hear . I told you our women are occupied and we do n't have children here . Even if we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have children here because there are no mothers left . You must see that . They are just women , not mothers . They give birth to children and , without a thought for that child , that baby boy , they leave him , desert him , abandon him in deep waters , leave him for the hungry beast to devour . They do n't care . They leave to go whoring at bars . They leave to work checking groceries at the supermarket . They leave to program computers , to service the Beast whose mark is bar codes and computer chips . You see this as well as me . " Here the noises of Molly trying to interrupt with a question were  | drowned out by Samuel Mordecai 's voice rising to a commanding shout . " Sit down and listen . Woman , you came to hear me tell what we believe . I 'm telling you . Now sit down and listen to it , the way I want to tell it , so you can write it as it should be . " molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though she were covered with fire ants . She pushed the " pause " button , feeling shaky and flushed . " Thelma , this is hard for me to listen to . I feel the need to explain something here . I am not accustomed to taking orders . Actually , caret remember a single time other than what you 're hearing here where I did anything I was told to do . But something happened when I was out there at Jezreel , something extremely upsetting to me . There is this ? , ? quality about Samuel Mordecai , and you should know this if you are going to talk to him . He has this . . . well . . . I really am at a loss for words here . He has something  --  some force  --  that caused me to sit down and shut up , even though sitting down and shutting up is something I have n't done since the third grade and even then I did n't do it very well . Maybe it was fear  --  I was afraid  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Molly knew her words were n't conveying the insane energy and repressed violence of the man . " Anyway , I never let this sort of thing happen before . " " I think I understand it a little , " Thelma said softly . " I think something like what you 're describing happens to those negotiators , too , when they 're talking to him on the phone . When they describe to us , the parents , what they 've been trying to do , they have a hard time explaining why they never seem to be able to say what they planned to say . They get cowed , sort of scared into being quiet , even when they 've planned to control the conversation . Molly , help me figure out how to prevent that from happening when I talk to him . Let 's hear the rest . " Molly turned the player back on . Samuel Mordecai 's voice rambled on , unimpeded now by questions or interruptions : " We are adrift , we socalled modern men , in a river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just like I was adrift , floating helpless , no identity , abandoned by all but the cloak of the Beast enfolding me . We have no mother to take care of us , because the mother is out whoring to the false God which has risen up from the mind of man and lives embodied in the computer , that false God disguised as progress , which promises ease and wealth , but delivers chaos and ? " Thelma held a hand up . " Stop it there . Can you stop it there and replay it ? " Molly hit the " stop " button . " How far back shall I go ? " " Go back to before where he talks about how there are no more mothers . "  | Molly hit the reverse button . " . . . We have no mother to take care of us , because the mother is out whoring to the false god ... " Molly hit the " pause " button . Thelma was leaning forward raptly . " What are you thinking ? " Molly asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his KLTX talk , but he goes farther here . He sure does n't think much of mothers . Did you know he was adopted ? " " You mean by his grandmother ? " " No . By his mother , Evelyn Grimes . Then after she adopted him , she ran off and left him with her mother , his grandmother . " Molly was surprised . " Whaaat ? I never heard or read anywhere that he was adopted . Where did you hear that ? " " His grandmother told me . She called me this morning . " " She did ? " " Yes . She saw me on television and had a vision that God wanted her to call me and tell me something she 'd never told anyone before . She said Donnie  --  that 's his real name , you know , Donnie Ray Grimes  --  was not really her flesh-and-blood grandson . Her daughter adopted him and then ran off and she had to take him over . She also wanted to tell me she 'd been praying for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she just wanted to crawl into a hole . " " Really ? She said her daughter adopted him ? " " Yes . " " I wonder if it 's true . It has n't appeared in any of the news coverage about him . " " Well , Miz Huff  --  that 's the grandmother  --  says her daughter kept it secret . Even her friends thought she gave birth to him . So they just never talked about it . But the feeling I got was Miz Huff wants to disown him . She was in an explaining sort of mode  --  said she tried to do right with him , but she did n't have much money or time or support . You know , the same thing all parents seem to say at some point : I did the best I could at the time . " Molly smiled . " Yeah . Seems to me I 've said that once or twice my-self . " " Here 's this idea I 'm working on . He 's real angry at mothers because his mother abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miz Huff does n't sound like much of a mom to me . So Mordecai thinks he can just steal these kids and use them for whatever it is he 's got in mind because no one really cares . " Thelma 's hands rose from where they 'd been resting in her lap and pressed against her chest as if she needed to hold something in . " So what if I could show him that there are mothers who love their children ? What if I could show him that I am a  | mother who loves her child so much she will risk everything for that child ? What if I walked in and offered myself , to replace Kim as a hostage ? What do you think of that idea , Molly ? " Molly thought it sounded like insanity . " The negotiators would never let you do that . One of their cardinal rules is no exchanging of hostages . " Thelma 's face mottled . " You do n't strike me as someone who is interested in rules . I 'm interested only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give a fuck what their rules are . " Molly , feeling chastised , nodded . " You 're right that children being abandoned by their mothers is a theme with Mordecai . It makes more sense if he was adopted  --  this imagery about being set adrift , like Moses . It must feel like that to be put up for adoption . " " Yes . I think so . Will you play the rest of it ? " Thelma pointed at the tape player . They sat in silence for an hour listening to the rest of Samuel Mordecai 's fiery sermon about corruption and prophecies that had been fulfilled . When it was finally over , Molly let out one shaky breath of relief and rewound the tape . " What was he doing during this ? " Thelma asked . " From the sound , he moves around all the time . " " Yes . He paces the room the whole time he 's talking . Lots of energy . He gestures a lot . " Molly used her index finger to stab the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his crotch and runs his fingers through his hair . He 's always on the move , twitchy in the extreme . Posing like a rooster , or a rock musician . And he rarely pauses for breath , so getting a word in , even if you are n't scared and cowed like I was , is impossible . The only way is to talk right on top of his words . It 's almost impossible to talk to him . " Thelma was taking it all in , nodding . " I 've seen it with the negotia-tors . " Her watch emitted a little beep and she glanced down at it . " Oh , damn . I need to run . I would n't go , but it 's TV  --  Channel 33 , which he watches . " She rose to her feet .

I want him to see me everywhere , on TV , in his dreams , hear me on the radio . I want him to know he ca n't get away from me . " " I was planning to talk to her anyway . I 'd be glad to ask her that . Give me the phone number and address and I 'll go tomorrow . " Thelma pulled a small red notebook out of her bag , looked up the  | number , and gave it to Molly along with her own phone number . " Call me when you get back . " Molly walked her to the door and , on an impulse , hugged her . Thelma was an armful , an earth mother , solid . " I 'll be thinking about you , Thelma . I do n't pray , but if I did , I 'd pray for you and Kim . " " I appreciate that . If you have any more ideas , call me , Molly . " Molly watched her walk down the hall , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed . Ideas  --  yes , she thought she just might have an idea coming up . It was just a whisper in her ear , a cold tingling in the back of her brain , nothing she could put into words yet , just that restless old feeling of an idea forming .  | The sound of the Bible slamming shut jarred Walter Demming back from planting geraniums in the huge terra-cotta pots on Theodora Shea " s south-facing terrace . The sun had been beating down on his bare back and his fingers were sunk deep in the damp , cool earth . He returned reluctantly and found himself sweating in the stinking air of a buried bus , with eleven hungry , frightened children , listening to a madman . " You heard it here ! " Samuel Mordecai shouted . " We 're on a collision course with destiny ! " In the enclosed prison of the bus his voice reverberated . He glistened with sweat ; it had soaked through his shirt and darkened his hair , which curled around his face in wet ringlets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology , this so-called progress ? rapidation , I call it  --  is really a machine out of control , spinning us faster and faster  --  it 's the final sign we 've been waiting on . " I know y'alI was raised playing them computer games , Lambs . They got computers at y'all 's school and they teach you to write book reports on them , and lots of you have one sitting on your desks at home . Looks pretty innocent , do n't it ? Like a toaster . But it 's all part of the grand scheme , clearing the way for the Antichrist . All you have to do is look at the faces in one of them arcades where the crackle and flashing lights of so-called computer games turn young folks like yourselves into robots for the Beast . Y'all remember the prophecy from the Book of Revelation and I do n't even have to open the book for this one : ' And he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast , that the image of the Beast should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed . ' It 's no wonder you young ones have fallen for this false prophet . Unless someone told you , like I 'm doing now , how would you know that the innocent little home computer is the way the Antichrist will control human life ? And , Lambs , it was all prophesied in the Bible . " He tossed his head , flicking sweat around him . " Remember : Earth 's probation terminates in five days . Ignore or disbelieve it at your own peril . Now , you ca n't say gosh I wish I'da known . Them that has heard and do n't take heed will get stamped on the soul with the bar code that glows blue and marks them , every one , for the angel Gabriel and his avenger band to find them and make them into blood statues to rot for all eternity . Amen ! " Walter Demming checked his watch . Only two hours and ten minutes . They were getting off easy today . Samuel Mordecai 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his hands in benediction , the Bible clutched in his right hand  --  a gesture so sanctimonious it made Walter want to leap out of his seat and attack the man , drag him to the ground and smash the expression off his face . As nutty and as incoherent as Mordecai 's message was , Walter did n't question the sincerity of it . But he loathed the drama with which it was delivered . Walter stifled the urge to attack . He got up quickly , put on his supplicant posture , and went to beseech  --  one more time . " Mr. Mordecai , may I have a word ? Please . " Walter turned away from the children and lowered his voice in the hope they would n't hear . " It 's about Josh . He 's getting sicker every day . He had an attack during the night . It almost killed him . He needs to be in a hospital . This is a matter of life and death . " Walter tried to look him in the eye , but Samuel Mordecai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please . " Walter reached out and took hold of his arm . " At the very least , send out for medication . Here " ? he pulled Josh 's empty inhaler out of his pocket ? " this is what he needs . " He pointed at the label . " See ? Albuterol . Two refills left . Please . " He tried to hand him the inhaler but Mordecai kept both hands behind his back . " And he should have another medication that he did n't have with him  --  a steroid inhaler , he says . " Walter bent closer and whispered , " I 'm afraid he 'll die down here . We have no way to help him when he has these attacks . Please let him go home . " He found himself hoping Josh would suffer an attack right now so this man could see how fearsome it was . With a saccharine smile , Samuel Mordecai said , " Inhalers ? Life and death ? Mr. Bus Driver , ca n't you hear how foolish you sound ? Here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Stars are whirling and seas turning to blood . Listen to yourself . Forces of momentous power and glory are heaving in the heavens and you 're fussing about inhalers . Are n't you listening ? " He gestured around to include the bus and all of them . " We are gathered here to advance God 's purpose , not to worry about runny noses . " He turned away again . But Walter held on to his arm . " Wait  --  this is no runny nose . It 's a child 's life and it does matter . Regardless of what is going on . You 're going to come down here tomorrow and find this little boy dead and you 'll be responsible for that . Then there 's no turning back . " " Turning back ? " Mordecai threw his head back and laughed , showing off his dimples and his even white teeth . " You think we could turn back now ? I fear for you , Mr. Bus Driver . You are n't listening . Young as they are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . " He put his head so close that Walter could feel his breath . " Time . Is . Ending . Get ready . " " Okay , " Walter argued , talking as fast as he could , " we 're getting ready , but why ca n't we have some way to make hot water and steam ? That would help . And we could wash in it , too . We just need a hot plate , or one of those coil things that heat water . And some instant coffee . Josh says that helps ease an attack , and citrus  --  a few lemons or oranges . Those are n't difficult to get . While we wait . Please . It would n't interfere with our . . . purification . And the children are hungry . Cereal is n't enough . They 're losing weight . Some of them have diarrhea and stomachaches . We need some real food down here , food that kids will eat . " Mordecai tugged his arm from Walter 's grip . " You figure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for burgers and fries ? " The mention of burgers made Walter 's mouth fill with saliva . He could feel the smooth fat beading on his tongue . " Yes , I do think so . And they keep asking how much longer we 're going to be here in the bus . It 's hot and stuffy and unhealthy . They need to move around , get sun and fresh air . A couple are getting real depressed and the rest are fighting all the time . Ca n't we just come out and stay as we are but be above-ground ? " " You 're in the process of purification , Mr. Bus Driver , even if you ca n't feel it . We are Hearth Jezreelites  --  a name given to me in a living vision , a rapture , where I was taken to God and He called me by name and the name He called me by was Prophet Mordecai . Hearth is earth with an H for heaven , heaven in earth . Fifty days it takes to make you ready . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been speaking into empty space . Now he turned to look at Walter . " Also , you 're down  | here for your own safety . When the federal government attacks us " ? he slapped his Bible against the driver 's seat ? " and , believe me , they will attack us , we want you to be out of harm 's way . Trust me , this is best for you and the Lambs . " " But how much longer ? " Samuel Mordecai reached behind him and from the back pocket of his jeans he pulled an X-acto knife and held it up for Walter to see . " You ; ask how much longer ? You know the answer to that , Mr. Bus Driver . I tell you every day . " With exaggerated fanfare , he turned and stepped to tile front of the bus . " You have the record right here in front of you . " He leaned over the grimy window and scraped off one of the five Band-Aids stuck there . They were flesh-colored with Ninja Turtles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mordecai had descended to welcome them , he had stuck the Band-Aids carefully to the glass , one by one , in neat rows , talking nonstop as he pressed each one on . There had been fifty of them , one for each day of what he called Earth 's final Pentecost , the countdown to Apocalypse . That first day , he 'd given them what he called the daily Bible study of the Lambs  --  the first of the grueling daily harangues . When he had finally finished talking , after three solid hours , he scraped one of the Band-Aids off the window with a flourish . He 'd done that every day , and now there were four left . He turned to Walter with a smile . " Four more days is the answer , Mr. Bus Driver . Until Friday , which is Passover and Good Friday . Very good Friday . " Samuel Mordecai pushed Walter aside . He was six inches taller and his long arms rippled with muscles . Walter resolved to double his daily push-ups . Mordecai addressed himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y'all to sit around and talk , discuss what I just told you about the final signs and prophecies . Mr. Demming is going to lead you in discussion and prayer . When you 've done that , Martin will come to hear what you talked about . Then he 'll bring you a meal to nourish your bodies in preparation for your glorious day . " He waved his Bible . Then he stepped out of the bus into the pit . He reached his arms up the hole , and with one quick motion , he hoisted himself up . His legs undulated upward . A shower of black earth sprinkled down long after the black boots had disappeared . Then came the grating sound : the wooden platform they used to cover the hole being dragged into place . As if all twelve had agreed on the need for total silence , no one spoke or moved . Walter sat down and closed his eyes . He 'd struck out again . He was useless . He had accomplished nothing , not one thing .  | Each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death was what was waiting for them on Friday  --  and he was unable to do a thing to change that . He could n't even do anything to ease the kids ' misery while they waited to die . He needed to figure out something else . Maybe if he got another chance to talk on the phone , he could send a message of some sort .... He heard the raspy bark of Josh 's cough . He opened his eyes . " I 'm so hungry , " Sandra whined . " Mr. Demming , I 'm hungry . " " Martin will bring us something to eat after we talk about what he said and after we tell Martin about it . Then we can eat . " " But I 'm so hungry I do n't know if I can wait , " Sandra said . Walter looked at the little girl in the front seat . She was a tall , skinny eight-year-old with thick glasses , mocha-colored skin , and an Afro haircut that had , in the past six weeks , grown into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair in the back reminded him of the shaggy crest of the roadrunners he saw in the field behind his house . And with her long legs and tendency to tilt forward when she walked , Sandra really did look like a roadrunner . He felt the urge to sketch her and wished he had paper and pencils , but they had run out of paper six days ago , except for his emergency supply . " I want to eat now , " Sandra insisted . The earpiece of her glasses had broken off in a fight with Heather and afterward Walter had managed to hold it together with the discarded Band-Aids Mordecai dropped on the floor after scraping them off the window . Walter had molded several to form a large lump at the corner of her glasses . " I 'm hungry , too , honey , " Walter told her . " It sure feels bad , but maybe we need to do something to take our minds off it until Martin comes . " " Mr. Demming , " Hector said , kneeling on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacksonville got caught by the Barbecue Tongs , why did n't he just fly away ? You know , before they grabbed him . He saw them and all , so he could have just split . " Walter stood and turned around to face the kids . He leaned against the seat and did a head count . Eleven . The faces appeared as small pale blobs in the dimness . He took one long deep breath and let it out slowly . " Well , Hector , remember that when the Barbecue Tongs surprised him , Jacksonville was in a narrow alley . Now , you have to picture this : Jacksonville is a full-grown adult turkey vulture and when he spreads his wings out " ? Walter stretched his arms out wide ? " they measure six feet across . To give you an idea of how long six feet is , I am five foot nine inches tall , so Jacksonville 's wingspread is three inches longer than the whole length of my body . Now , the alley he was in  --  you remember he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gai Pan  --  well , this  | alley measured only five and a half feet across . In order to fly he has to stretch his wings wide and flap them , but the alley was too narrow . And it was bricked off at one end . And of course at the other end that whole company of Tongs  --  three hundred of them  --  were waving their long iron forks and those whippy spatulas they use . So he could n't fly or run . And of course he was outnumbered three hundred to one . " " To two , " said Heather . " No , to one , dummy . " Hector reached over the seat back and gave her blond head a shove . " You never get it right , Heather-head . Lopez was n't with him . " Walter looked at Heather to see if the shove , or the words , had got her hackles up . The child was usually quick to take offense and fight with anyone , but now she was sitting peacefully , sideways with her back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter watched her face as he spoke . " Remember , honey , Lopez was sleeping in a burrow in the jungle and could n't wake up to go into the village with Jacksonville . He 'd been eating those slumber bugs again , and they made him sleepy all the time . Now , that was a good thing  --  not that he was eating slumber bugs , that 's bad , having a habit that dulls the senses like slumber bugs do ? but it 's good that he did n't get captured , too . " Heather nodded . Walter was relieved that she was not going to fight over this ; he hated it when they fought and he did n't have a clue how to deal with it . He wanted them to cooperate so when the time came for them to put their emergency plan into action , they would work together effectively . He knew from his experience in Vietnam that the military was right about one thing  --  an effective fighting unit had to cooperate to get the job done . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lately , when they squabbled , he felt his nerves vibrating like a high-voltage wire . Lucy raised her hand to talk , a habit she could n't get over , even though Walter kept telling her she did n't need to . " What happens , " she asked , " after they put Jacksonville in that little cage ? What was the fire for ? " She was hugging her knees in to her chest , resting her chin on her knees . There was a smear of dirt on her cheek . " Oh , well , I 'll tell you all that in good time , " Walter said . " But first we need to talk about what we 're going to say to Martin . " He paused , hoping the kids would come up with something because he hated feeding them lies ; it was better , somehow , if they invented their own . Conrad Pease , ten years old , raised his hand . He came from a devout Baptist family . His daddy was a part-time preacher , and Conrad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We could just say we talked about how amazing it is that Bible prophecies made so long ago are coming true in  | our time and that it 's amazing they predicted all the bad stuff that would happen with computers way before they were even invented . And we could say we really hope he 'll tell us more about it in future lessons . " Hector Ramirez groaned . " Do n't say we want him to teach us nothing more . I ca n't stand no more of his talking and shit . " " He 's gon na do it anyways , " Conrad snapped back . " No matter what we say . " " You should n't say that , Hector , " Lucy said . " Bad word . " Brandon Betts in the last row raised his hand . His face was dark with anger . " We ought to really talk about it . People who get a chance to hear and do n't listen are the ones who will get made into blood statues . " His voice got higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we 're supposed to be talking about God and all . I do n't want that to happen to me , what he said about the laser knife and everything . " Everyone was quiet . Walter Demming looked at Lucy , who had pressed her hands over her ears . It was all so difficult . He had made a judgment call on the first day : to talk honestly to the kids about what he thought of Samuel Mordecai and how they should behave . They would all pretend attention and respect to him because he had power over their bodies . But his message was wrong and they would resist it . To retain their sanity . But some of the kids were breaking down under what amounted to brainwashing . Especially Brandon Betts and Sue Ellen Mc-Gregor . " Well , " Walter said , in the lowest , calmest voice he could muster , " there are two things I feel sure about , Brandon . First , the world is not going to end in four days . I promise that . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The second thing I 'm sure about is that none of us is going to hell . Not no way . And there 's no such thing as blood statues . Now , you may be right , Brandon , that we should n't lie and say we 've been talking about something when we have n't , but it seems to me we need some time off from this stuff . But let 's discuss it . What do the rest of you think ? Should we talk about what Mr. Mordecai was saying ? " There were several groans . " No . We heard enough , " Hector said . " I hate that shit . I want to hear about Lopez and Jacksonville . Go on , Mr. Demming . Conrad will tell them  --  you know , what he just said , and the rest of us will all say uh-huh , that 's right . Yeah . Amen . " There was nodding and okays all around . Brandon sat silent with his arms crossed over his chest . Lucy took her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . In her no-nonsense voice that made her sound more like thirty than eleven , she said , " It 's settled , then . Conrad will tell them what we talked about . It 's not really a lie , because  | we did kind of talk about it just now . Now Mr. Demming can go on with the story , okay , everyone ? " Most of the kids were nodding , as if a voice of authority had spoken and it was indeed settled . Walter studied Kimberly 's snubby nose and stubborn chin . He was in awe . She was the most self-possessed person he 'd ever known . How on earth did parents manage to produce such a child ? She helped Walter with the younger children , and had taken Josh on as a special project . She was tender and creative in helping to relax the boy through his asthma attacks . And in a way , Walter thought , her high expectations for how responsible adults should act had been his own guide through this unfamiliar situation . He often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter hunkered in the aisle where all the kids could see him . " Back to Jacksonville , for those who want to listen . " He paused to give those who did n't want to participate a chance to settle down where they wanted . Several kids moved closer . Even though she did n't listen to the story , or pretended not to , Sandra stayed in her seat at the front . She had staked it out because it was closer to the light , so she could read . Brandon Betts let out a snort of derision . He got up from the seat and stalked the aisle to the back , where he stretched his considerably thinned-down but still chunky eleven-year-old body out on the floor . He seemed to need to get as far away from the story as he could , even though it meant being closer to the stinking hole in the back . He opened his math book and started to page through it . Philip Trotman , eyes shut , leaned his forehead against the window . Walter did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions or commented or looked Walter 's way during the storytelling . The remaining eight settled back in their seats , ready to listen . Walter Demming could n't remember having told a story before in his entire life . If he 'd been asked , he would have said he was not a storyteller . Circumstances had forced him into it , or it might be more accurate to say , Kim had forced him into it , and the process had carried him along . On that first day , after the lights went out , and the trapdoor slid shut overhead , it had been a nightmare . Kids began to scream . Then the others had picked up the panic . It grew to a chorus of sobbing , screaming , and calling out for mothers and fathers . The children milled around , bumping into one another in the dark , crying out . Underneath it all , he could hear Josh coughing and wheezing . Walter had groped his way through the door and onto the bus , bumping into seats and panicky children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to soothe with his voice , but no one could hear him over  | the frenzied wailing . He needed to do something , to take charge , calm them down , but he could n't think of anything to do . As the screaming went on , he felt his own panic surging in his chest . His brain wanted to join in the screaming . But he was the adult here , he had told himself . The only adult . These kids were going to lose their minds if he did n't do something . " Quiet , y'all ! " A lilting girl 's voice , a twangy angel-sound , had risen out of the cacophony . It lifted above the other voices and dominated . " Now , that 's enough of that , y'all . Someone 's gon na get hurt if we do n't settle . Quiet down now , everybody . The lights will go back on , but let 's all sit down together and wait . Come on up to the front . Come on . We can hold hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell us a story . " Our bus driver ? That was him . He was their driver . He did n't know any stories . And even if he did , he did n't think he could tell one in the dark , in the middle of such chaos . But the voice had promised a story . And , miraculously , the promise seemed to be calming the children . They were quieting . Several screamers had stopped . The noise gradually subsided to a few sobs and whispers . There was rustling and the gentle pressure of bodies all around him in the dark . A small hand grabbed his and held on hard . The firmness and warmth of it felt comforting . Walter squeezed back . He opened his mouth , then cleared his throat . " Okay . Now . Find a place to sit , children , " he said . " Sit down . That 's right . And hold the hand of the person next to you . Good . " He heard them settling down all around him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My name is Walter Demming , " he said . " I have a story to tell you . But first I 'd like each of you to tell me your name and how old you are so I can sort of do a count . Okay ? Just call out . " The voices came out of the darkness : " Hector Ramirez . I 'm twelve , man . " " Heather Yost . I 'm ten , almost eleven . " " Conrad Pease . Just turned ten on Tuesday . " " Sue Ellen McGregor , I 'm eight . How old are you , Mr. Bus Driver ? " " I 'm fifty-one , " Walter said , " and I 'm Mr. Demming . Go on with your names , please . " The names came : Kimberly Bassett , age eleven ; Lucy Quigley , age ten ; Josh Benderson , age eleven ; Sandra Echols , age eight ; Brandon Betts , age eleven ; Bucky DeCarlo , age six . Then silence fell . Walter said , " That 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't given their name ? " There was some murmuring and a voice said , " Come on , Philip , tell  | him your name . " There was a brief silence and finally a faint voice said , " Philip Trotman . I 'm nine . " " Good , " Walter said . " All twelve of us are here . " It had been his first count . Then , still holding on to the small hand , he squatted down in the dark aisle and waited for a story to come to him . They were expecting it . He could sense the anticipation in the air . They were sitting there waiting for a story . That 's what did it , he decided later  --  their anticipation sucked from him a story he did n't even know was there . " Once upon a time , " he began . " Once upon a time there was a turkey vulture who lived in Austin , Texas . His name was Jacksonville and he had a good friend named Lopez . He worried that because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The story began like a weak trickle , but then it flowed , and by the time the lights came back on , Jacksonville and Lopez had been given an important mission by the President of the United States , and everyone seemed calmer . But the calm had n't lasted long , because , when the lights came back on , Samuel Mordecai had arrived . He had dropped down into the underworld and started preaching . He had strutted up and down the aisle spouting Bible verses and doom . Forty-six days had passed and the man was still strutting and preach-ing . But at least the lights had stayed on after his first visit . That first terrifying darkness had not been repeated , though they all worried about it . Every time a bulb flickered or dimmed , they were afraid it was burning out . And there was always the possibility the Jezreelites would just flip the switch again and plunge them back into the darkness and panic of the first day . Once he had started telling the story , it spun itself out spontaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The characters rose up and spoke . Often it felt like the story was telling itself , just passing through him . It did n't seem to be doing the kids any harm , and it filled some empty time , so he had kept it going with one installment a day , or sometimes two , if it was a particularly difficult day . He cleared his throat . " Remember last night after the Tongs caught Jacksonville , they put him in a bamboo cage ? Remember how scared he was ? He fought . He beat his wings against the bars . But the cage was strong . The bars were made of thick stalks of green bamboo . And it was small  --  so low that he could n't stand up straight . A turkey vulture perching is about two and a half feet tall and this cage was only two feet four inches high , so he had to keep his head bent over to one side . And when  | he saw what they were doing  --  building a fire and bringing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was . " Walter leaned forward as he felt the story welling up . " Now , the Tongs had never seen a vulture like Jacksonville . They have vultures in Tongaland , of course  --  there are vultures of one kind or another all over the world  --  but theirs are much smaller , only half the size , and they do n't have red heads or pale yellow feet , so Jacksonville was a curiosity , a freak . Like I told you last night , they put the cage right in the middle of the village where all the people passed by . Word got around , the way it will do in a village , and everybody came to look at him . They all came ? old grannies and little children , men and women , even babies who could barely walk  --  all day long they came by . They stared and poked him with those long forks , and they laughed . " Jacksonville was used to people laughing at him . People often found him ugly . Now , it 's real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know how painful it is because you 're all exceptionally handsome children , but Jacksonville knew because he 'd run into it a lot . People , and other animals even , would see him and say yuck , how ugly . And they would call him bad names : buzzard or filthy buzzard , which is very insulting to a turkey vulture . And it was n't just because of the way he looked , he knew that . Lots of people did n't like what he ate . " " Dead things , " Bucky said . " He ate dead things . " " Gross ! " Heather exclaimed . " Yeah . But we eat dead things , too , " Sue Ellen McGregor said . As she listened , she wove thin strands on her string box , the only one that had survived the first day 's confiscation of backpacks and possibly dangerous items . She had made friendship bracelets for all the girls before Walter discovered how strong and flexible the finished products were . Now he had her making long ropelike lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone on the bus envied Sue Ellen 's possession of the string box , even Walter , because it was such a calming activity and actually produced something useful . " Let him tell it , " Josh said . " Mr. Demming 's telling it . " " Yeah , " Lucy said . Walter turned toward Sue Ellen . " That 's a good point . Most of us do eat the meat of dead animals , which really is n't much different from what Jacksonville ate . But some people are grossed out by the vulture 's habit of eating carrion . " " What 's carrion ? " Sue Ellen asked . " Dead animals , " he said , " and they 're often rotting by the time the vultures find them . Of course , you and I know that vultures do a lot of good by cleaning up the roads , but still , some people just ? "  | Hector interrupted . " But did n't you say that Jacksonville had been trying to stop eating meat ? That he was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all got hungrier , both his story and the kids ' questions turned more and more toward the subject of food . Just the mention of meat , even rotting carrion , could make his mouth water now . After forty-six days of nothing but cold cereal with a little milk and an occasional peanut butter sandwich , they were all food-crazy . It was one of the main topics of conversation : what each of them was going to eat when they got home . " Yes , that 's right , Hector , " Walter said . " He 'd been trying hard for several years to change his diet , but it was n't working out very well . Jacksonville found he needed meat to keep his strength up . Flying takes lots of energy and his body craved meat even though his mind did n't like the idea of it . " " Maybe we 're all going to get sick ' cause we do n't get meat , " Conrad said . " My mom always talks about protein and how we have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " are n't there sicknesses you get without meat ? " " Lots of people are vegetarians , " Walter replied , " and they 're healthy . There 's protein in the cereal they give us and the milk . And lots in peanut butter . " He had been surprised at how basically healthy they all had stayed on the limited diet they 'd been given . It was boring as hell , but they were surviving on it . " So , " he said , getting back to the story , " Jacksonville turned out to he like all the people in the world who go on diets and ca n't hack it . He went back to eating whatever he could scavenge . " Now , the Tongs were all standing around his cage talking , but Jacksonville did n't know what they were saying . See , he did n't know their language , which was Tonganese . When he saw them gathering more firewood and building up the fire under the pot , he was so scared he nearly passed out . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be him that was going to get cooked in that pot . " Then he noticed the Tongs were bringing baskets of things and dumping them into the pot , things that looked like onions and potatoes and carrots . Maybe in this village they were vegetarians . That was a hopeful idea . But then he remembered what Tong teeth looked like and he was afraid . " And something happened that scared him even more . A bunch of Tong warriors were standing in front of his cage looking in and laughing . One of them , a big guy with a huge gut on him , did something really scary . He pointed at Jacksonville , then he stood on his tiptoes and  | crowed like a rooster  --  cock-a-doodle-doo . Then he did this with his fin-ger . " Walter stuck out his index finger and drew it slowly across his throat . " This made all the men laugh and pound their spatulas on the ground . Then they all danced around flapping their arms up and down like they were trying to fly and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funniest thing in the world . And when they laughed you could see all their teeth , these long pointed teeth that Jacksonville found really scary . He felt like he was going to throw up . " By now it had gotten dark and people were gathering around the fire . It looked like the whole village was coming . There was even a parade of old people with fur and feathers around their necks . Something was about to happen . Definitely . " Then two big warriors went to a cage Jacksonville had n't even noticed . It was on the other side of the fire . And they pulled an old man out . He was naked , and he had a long and dirty white beard . They tried to get him to stand up , but he could n't , so they dragged him toward the pot . Jacksonville felt relieved that someone else , not him , was going to get cooked in that pot . " But then Jacksonville saw the old man 's face and he felt just awful . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacksonville and Lopez were in Tongaland was to rescue Dr. Mortimer . He was thinner than in the picture Jacksonville had seen , but it was Dr. Mortimer . " Jacksonville was very upset . As you can imagine . He hated to see anyone get hurt , and here was the most important person in the world about to get cooked . And you guys remember why he was so important . " " Because of the Galaxy Peace Ray , " Bucky said , his thumb in his mouth . " That 's right . Dr. Mortimer was the only one in the world who knew how to make the Astral 100 Galaxy Peace Ray . He invented it . That 's why the President of the United States sent Jacksonville and Lopez to find him . " " How does it work again ? " Lucy asked . " You told us at the beginning , but I forgot . " " Well , it looks like one of those old-fashioned machine guns you see in gangster movies . But when you fire it at someone , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It shoots out these tiny little dots of light that land on the person being shot . " He pretended to shoot a machine gun at Hector in the first seat and made a machine-gun noise : " Rat-a-ta-ta ! And the person starts to twinkle and they feel this strange thing happening to them  --  a tingle like when someone tickles the inside of your arm with their fingertips very gently . But you feel this all over your body . And then the sparks die out and they 're gone and you think  | that 's it . What you do n't know is that it 's changed you and the next time you feel like doing something mean or hitting someone or fighting , you get that feeling again , that tingling , and you find you could n't possibly fight or hurt anyone . " So here 's Jacksonville feeling awful because he was hoping the person in the other cage would get cooked instead of him and that person turned out to be Dr. Mortimer  --  the reason Jacksonville came to Tonga-land  --  the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to save him . But he was too scared to even move . He just watched as they lifted the old man to toss him into the boiling pot . " Then something amazing happened . Just as the Tongs were picking Dr. Mortimer up to throw him in the boiling pot , it started to rain . And not just some little rain , pitter-pat . It was like a downpour . And it was a funny yellowish color . It put the fire right out . " The Tongs all ran to their hootches and two big ones dragged Dr. Mortimer back to the cage and stuffed him in . " Walter stopped talking . He heard the scraping noise of the wood slab over the hole being pushed back . Every eye was focused hungrily on the pit at the bus door . First two dirty white tennis shoes appeared , and then hairy bare legs , then khaki shorts , and then Martin dropped to earth , his skinny chest and narrow shoulders heaving from the effort . As always , his thin face was stony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you close our discussion with a prayer ? " " Yessir . Bow your heads , please . " Conrad stood and said in the solemn voice he used only for religious matters , " Dear Heavenly Father , help us to understand the message we 've been given . Thank you for our many blessings and make us ever mindful of the needs of others . Amen . " " Amen , " they all chorused , bringing their heads up quickly to see if Martin had brought a box of food . But he stepped into the bus empty-handed . Sandra began to cry , and Hector called out , " Where 's breakfast , man ? " All eleven of them sagged in their seats . Walter 's stomach felt like it was being twisted and squeezed . He stood and approached Martin , who was the only Hearth Jezreelite other than Samuel Mordecai they had seen since the first day . " Morning , " Walter said , trying to engage the man 's eyes . But Martin kept his narrow , close-set eyes averted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today ? " Walter tried to inject some playfulness into his tone . " We sure deserve a break today . It would do wonders for our prayers of praise and thanksgiving . " " You 're supposed to tell me what y'all talked about , " Martin said . " Then I 'll bring cereal . "  | Walter moved a little closer . " Conrad will give you a report on our discussion . But do you think we could get a new lightbulb ? The one in the back burned out last night . And , Martin , we really need some hot water down here . To wash in and so we can steam Josh when he has an attack . Do you have any of those heating coils , or a hot plate , or even an electric coffeepot with an extension cord ? Please , Martin , we really need that . And some soap , too . " All the time he spoke , Walter was trying to get Martin to look at him , but the man refused . " Okay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me about your discussion ? " While Conrad gave a recitation of the theological issues they had touched on , Walter studied their captor . Martin had greasy black hair combed straight back from a narrow face . His nose was beaky and thin , his lips almost nonexistent . Several days ' growth of patchy black stubble dotted his face . His expression was one of constant impatience . If Walter were to draw him as a bird it would probably be a common grackle . It occurred to Walter that during their entire captivity Martin had come down at least twice a day , often three times , to bring them food and fresh water . By his calculations , that made well over a hundred visits . In all that time , Martin had never once looked directly at Walter or any of the children . Like a jury never looking directly at a person they were about to convict . It was the one thing , more than any other , that convinced Walter Demming that they had been condemned to death .  | The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a trailer park off Barton Springs Road . The park had often caught Molly 's attention as she drove by because it was a pocket of rural Americana from the sleepy fifties deposited right in the middle of growth-spurt Austin of the nineties . On a busy , commercial strip , flanked by trendy bars and restaurants , Piney Haven possessed an otherworldly aura of dappled light and seedy charm . An unpaved road wound through tall pecans and pines that sheltered rows of trailers which looked permanently settled into the landscape . Today , in the ninety-degree heat , the shade looked particularly cool and inviting . She stopped at the ramshackle office and went in . A girl of around twelve was sitting on the desk reading a comic book . Her lips moved as she read . " Hi , " Molly said . " Could you tell me where Jacob Alesky lives ? " The girl did n't look up . " Like you was going , all the way back . Second from the end , green awning . " " Is he in ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't go out much these days . " She went back to her reading . Molly thought about asking why Jacob Alesky did n't go out much anymore , but decided to let that information reveal itself . This was the sort of environment that encouraged you to relax and go with the flow . She drove to the end of the road , admiring a cluster of vintage  | Airstream trailers . There was something about them that had always appealed to her  --  the friendly , rounded contours , the stainless-steel luster . It made her feel nostalgic for softer , gentler times in the same way that jukeboxes and Chevy trucks from the fifties did . Like most nostalgia , she thought , it was a longing for something she 'd never known . She pulled up next to a long cream-colored trailer with a green-and-white-striped awning stretching the length of it . Under the awning , three lawn chairs and a hibachi sat on a stone terrace . Molly crossed the terrace to the door , which was propped open . She tried to peer inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . " Mr. Alesky , " she called up into the trailer . " Are you there ? " " Who wants to know ? " The deep male voice sounded prickly . " Molly Cates wants to know . I 'm from Lone Star Monthly magazine , Mr. Alesky . I would have called , but I could n't find a number for you . " " That 's because I do n't have a number . " She glanced up at the telephone line that ran from a nearby pole to the end of the trailer and said nothing . She expected him to appear in the doorway , but nothing happened . After a long minute , she called , " Could I talk to you please , Mr. Alesky ? " " About what ? " " I hate to shout . Could you come to the door ? " She was answered with silence . A black cat , long-haired and huge , appeared from under the trailer . It stretched and sauntered toward her . Its fur was matted and full of sticker burrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dragged its long bedraggled body against her . Reluctantly , she squatted down and scratched it under the chin . She did n't much like cats and found this one particularly unappealing . But it was an old reporter 's trick : paying attention to people 's children and animals was a good way to ingratiate yourself , so she gave the beast a good scratch . Then she glanced at the trailer door to see if she had an audience . She did . A man in a wheelchair sat there looking down at her . " Handsome cat , huh ? " he said , watching her closely . " Affectionate , anyway . " " Affectionate , yes , " the man said . " He belongs to my neighbors , who are n't affectionate and who tend to forget they have a cat . " " I 'm Molly Cates . " " So you said . " " Are you Jacob Alesky ? " " What remains of him . " He answered with a wave of his right arm . " At your service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look away , avert her head , but she forced  | herself to look directly at him . He seemed to be little more than a torso propped up in the wheelchair . The doorway where he sat was in deep shadow and there was a jumble of drapery involved in his pinned-up pant legs , so she was n't sure exactly what was there and what was n't . There seemed to be the stump of a left thigh sticking out , but mostly he was a long torso with dangling arms . " Mr. Alesky , if this is a convenient time , 1 'd like to talk to you about Walter Demming . " " How did you know about me ? " " From a person who works at my magazine . She knows someone who lives here , and he told her you 're an old friend of Demming 's . She told me because I 'm planning to write something about the Jezreel situa-t ion . " " Well , " Alesky said , " the FBI found me the first week . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually since Walter has become something of a celebrity . " He laughed , the deep laugh of a whole man , which took her by surprise . " An unwilling celebrity , for sure . Miss Cates , you ca n't know how funny this is . There was never a less likely candidate for fame than Walter Demming . " " Why is that ? " " Walter took vows . When we got back from ' Nam . One of them was obscurity and another was no entanglements . He lived without a phone for twenty years . I bet he 's sorry now he got one . " " Why ? " " Because phones tend to suck you into the world . He got one when he started driving the bus so they could reach him for schedule changes . And now it 's gotten him into what he hated most . " " What 's that ? " " Contention and violence . " There was an edge to his voice . " What sort of world is it where what you try hardest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed again . " I 'd tell you his other vows , but I do n't know you well enough . " " We could correct that situation . " Molly pointed to the lawn chairs . " I could sit down , and we could drink a beer . I have a six-pack of Coors Light in a cooler in my truck . Will you join me ? " " No Shiner Bock ? " " Sorry ? He tilted his head to the side . " Okay . A beer sounds good right now . I 'll come down . We 'll sit on the veranda . " He stretched out the word " veranda " to make it sound southern and very grand . Molly looked at the three steps descending from the trailer door to  | the ground , then back at the wheelchair . She had no idea how he was going to get down . " Do n't worry about it , " Alesky said . " You get the beer and I 'll be right there . " The wheelchair disappeared from the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red Igloo out of the back seat . When she turned around , Alesky and his wheelchair were descending as if by magic on a platform she had n't noticed to the side of the door . With a whir it lowered him to the terrace . He wheeled his chair off , came to a stop next to one of the three lawn chairs , and turned to watch her approach . With a frankly appraising gaze , he studied her hips as she moved . She stared right back at him . He must have been a tall man , for his torso and arms were long and lanky . If his legs had matched he would have been well over six feet . His face was pitted across the forehead and along the cheeks with what looked like old acne scars and his gangly red neck was inflamed with active boil-like lumps , like a teenager 's , though he was probably close to fifty . His nose was scimitar-shaped , off center and lumpy , as if it had been broken many times . His hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you think ? " he asked . Molly sat down in the chair closest to him . She set the cooler at her feet and leaned down to open it . " I think we 've got us a fine evening for sitting here in the shade and drinking a beer . " " I mean what do you think about me  --  the physical me ? " Molly pulled a sleek silver can of Coors out of the ice and popped the top . As she handed it to him , she looked directly into his face . Shaded by long dark lashes , his eyes were hazel . They challenged her for an answer . " I think there 's more of you remaining here than got left behind , " she replied . He put the can to his lips and tipped his head back to drink . His Adam 's apple bobbed as he drank . When he lowered the can , he said , " Just what is it that got left behind , do you think ? " " Well , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " All I can see is that there 's a lot left . " " The glass-is-half-full shit . " He said it pleasantly . " Not really . I 'm not that positive . It 's just that I keep getting surprised by loss . I see disasters happen  --  to me , to other people  --  and I think , well , that 's the end , all is lost . But then people survive and go on , and I see how much remains . " " That remains to be seen , " he said with a smile . " Mr. Alesky , could I ask you about ? " " Jake . My name is Jake . "  | " Jake . Good . And I 'm Molly . " She reached down into her bag for her notebook and laid it on her lap . " Molly . " He looked at her , nodding his head in approval . " I like that ? Molly . " She thought Jake Alesky was a man who really enjoyed women and she hoped fervently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You and Walter Demming go way back  --  to Vietnam , my friend says . " He nodded . " Ancient history . If you think I 'm planning to tell you anything about that , just because you brought this beer " ? he held up his beer can ? " you 're mistaken . Why should I tell you anything about Walter ? He 's a real private person . " " Not anymore he 's not . He was in the wrong place at the wrong time and now he 's , like you said , a celebrity , even if he is an unwilling one . He 's public property , and since I 'm going to write something about him , it might as well be accurate . This is a chance for you to tell it straight . " He did n't answer right away . He took a long swig of his beer and kept his eyes on the cat , who had leaped up on a stump and was grooming a paw . Then he said , " Maybe . Maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there anything you want to ask me , something about me , before we move to Walter ? Let 's play a game : You get to ask me one free question and I have to answer it . Then I get to ask you one and you have to answer it . " Jake , I do n't ? " He held up a hand to stop her . " That 's my fee . You want me to help you , tell you things you can write in your story . If you want to hear about Walter , you need to play the game . " He pointed at the notebook resting on her lap . " But your question ca n't be anything that 's on your notepad , like how him and me got to be friends , or whether he has a lady love . It 's got to be something personal about me . And something real , something that you are sitting there wondering about . " Molly sat back and took a sip of her beer , letting it slide down slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in spite of everything she found it interesting . " Okay , " she said . " Do I go first ? " He nodded . " Okay , " she repeated . " Okay . When you lose part of your body , like a leg , do you dream of yourself as you used to be or as you are now ? " He lowered his head and sat silent for a full minute . It was a long minute and Molly wanted to bite her tongue off . She had gone with the first impulse , what came to mind uncensored , and she had hurt him . Finally he lifted his head . " What a fine question . I had to think about it . I dream of myself as I am now , Molly , but with a difference . A big difference . In my dreams I have no legs , but I can do things , remarkable  | things , that I could n't do before . I can fly and I can do flips in the air , and I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace and ease . " He had been looking off into space as he spoke , but now he looked Molly in the eye . " And I can fuck all night long . Anything else you want to ask me ? " She shook her head . " Now it 's your turn . " He studied her , narrowing his eyes . " Okay . Here 's what I want to know . When you see how this freak Mordecai gets off on publicity , do n't you feel a little . . . sick at your stomach writing about him , giving him more of what he wants , like maybe you 're encouraging him ? " It was a question that had haunted Molly throughout her long crimewriting career . " Let me back up a little , " she said . " Two years ago , after Waco , I wrote a piece on other apocalyptic cults in Texas . Samuel Mordecai was one of the cult leaders I interviewed . I chose to write about that because I 've always been interested in obsession and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something so extreme that he 's willing to live and die for it . Anyway , once I got into it , I hated it . I hated him , Samuel Mordecai , and the whole crazy thing he believes in . And , beyond that , I got this crawly , unclean feeling about what was going on there in Jezreel . So in answer to your question , yes , I do worry about giving him the publicity he craves . " " So why are you writing about it again if you hated it the first time ? " " Well , I have n't taken a vow of obscurity . My boss thinks this will be a big story for me , so I 'm doing it . Also , I am obsessed by . . . obsession , I guess . I do n't know why . " He made a low sound of comprehension in his throat . " That sounds like an honest answer . Let me cheat here and ask a follow-up : Since you 've met this guy Mordecai , you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think about their chances  --  Walter and the kids ? " Molly felt her throat constrict ; she hated to give voice to the fears that had been simmering below the surface . " I do n't know . I do n't know , Jake , but I 'm scared . Samuel Mordecai is this . . . well , he 's the sort of man who if he predicts the world is going to end on April fourteenth , he 's not going to just sit around and watch the day pass by uneventfully and say , Oops , I was wrong , sorry . ' That is just not going to happen . " Jake nodded . " But he ca n't make the world end , now can he ? " She shrugged . " Oh , my . That crazy man made one hell of an impression on you , lady . " " Molly , " she said .  | " Molly . That crazy man made one hell of an impression on you , Molly . " " Yes . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake finished his beer with a long swig , then looked down at the cooler . " How about a beer ? " she said . " Do n't mind if I do . " Molly took his empty can from his hand and replaced it with a cold one from the cooler . " Thanks . I 've been short on groceries , " he said . " What do you know about Walter ? " She tossed the empty can into the cooler and closed it . " Nothing . I know what he looks like , in a newspaper photo anyway . I know he 's a Vietnam veteran , he grew up in Beaumont , played football , went to Rice for two years , drives a school bus now , does some gardening . That 's it . " She took a long sip of her drink . " Tell me about him . " Jake looked down at his beer can for several seconds . " It 's much harder to tell what someone 's like when you know them real well than when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . I think it 's because you know all the exceptions and complexities , so it 's hard to summarize . Would it help if I asked questions ? " " Well , ask a few easy ones to get me going , and we 'll see . " " How did he feel about the Vietnam War ? " Jake laughed . " If that 's an easy one , I 'm scared about when we get to the hard stuff . How did he feel about the war ? Well , Walter got to Vietnam snorting and pawing the ground . You should have seen him  --  this beefy , loud high school jock  --  a real John Wayne , the American warrior . You know . The kind that had a crew cut even before the army did it to him . Could n't wait to show his stuff , be a real hero . " He let his eyes wander off into the dappled shade . When he brought them back into focus , he said , " Eleven months later , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrior , and I looked like this . " He glanced down at where his legs should have been . " And I believe the change in him was more dramatic than the change in me . But to answer your question , Walter started out thinking the war was necessary to teach the Commies a lesson , keep them in their place . But he ended up being the one who learned the lesson . " " What was the lesson ? " " Well , Molly , it is n't always easy to summarize these things , is it ? " " No , it certainly is n't . " " I 'll try . At the Milwaukee Zoo  --  I 'm from Milwaukee , did you know that ? "  | " No . " " Well , at the Milwaukee Zoo , where I used to hang out when I was a kid , in the primate house , there 's a sign on a cage that says : the most dangerous animal in the world . ' When you go over to look in , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected . " Molly nodded . " Amen , " she said . He finished off his beer with a very long swig . " Yeah . And a twenty-year-old Texas boy may be the prime example of that species . " " And that 's the lesson Walter Demming learned in Vietnam ? " " One of them . " " What happened to teach him that lesson ? " He held the beer can up in his right hand and with a single squeeze crumpled it into a ball as easily as if it were a piece of paper . " That I 'm not going to talk about , " he said in a quiet voice . " So do n't bother asking again . " Molly found herself making a mental note , in boldface , to do just that  --  ask again . When people said they absolutely would not talk about a certain subject , they usually came around to talking about it at great length . " All right , " she said . " Something I was wondering about  --  Walter went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good student . How come he ended up driving a bus ? " " That question disappoints me , Molly , " Jake said . " It suggests a conventional turn of mind that defines a person by what he does to make a living . Anyway , he has n't ended up ' yet  --  not unless as we speak he 's dead . " Molly studied the man sitting next to her with renewed respect . " I agree . It is a disappointing question . I could defend myself by saying I write for an audience made up of a bunch of yuppies and they will be wondering about that . Of course I would never use that as an excuse . " She smiled at him . " But I wish you 'd answer the question even though it is obnoxious . " " Okay . You might say by way of explanation that after Vietnam , Walter dropped out . " " He dropped out ? " " Yeah . And in Walter 's case dropping out was major , a crash , like falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , he dropped out with a vengeance . Driving a bus is what he does to make money . It 's not what he does . " " What 's the real thing he does ? " " Well " ? he looked at her for a moment as if he were considering something ? " I could show you . I think you 'd find it interesting . But we 'd have to drive out to his house . "  | Molly found her pulse quickening . " I 'd like to . " She kept her voice even . " I have a key . I need to check on things anyway . Miss Shea is keeping an eye on the house , but I 'd like to check . " " When would you like to go ? " " How about now ? " Molly checked her watch . " Oh . I ca n't . I have a date with my daughter in a half hour , and a telephone interview scheduled after that . Could we do it tomorrow ? " " Sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her plans , but Jo Beth would be on her way already , and the phone interview with Dr. Asquith was important . " I 'm planning to drive to Elgin in the morning , " she said . " How about late afternoon ? I could pick you up around four . " " I 'll be here , " he said . She dropped the two empty beer cans back in the cooler and closed it . " You have n't told me the other vows that Walter took . " " Let 's save them for tomorrow . " " Okay . " She picked up the cooler and was about to turn away when she added , " You said you were short on groceries , Jake . Tomorrow 's my shopping day . Are there some things I could pick up for you ? " He looked up at her with interest . " That 's a nice offer , but could we stop at a store on the way home from Walter 's ? Then I could do my own shopping . " She wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure . " " And do n't worry . I can get in and out on my own . I 'll just need you to help with the chair . " " Okay . See you tomorrow . " She turned and walked toward the truck . " Oh , Molly , " he called out , " maybe you could leave that cooler with me till tomorrow . " She took the cooler back to him , wondering if your tolerance for alcohol was lower if you had no legs . " Set it down there on the chair , please , so I can reach it , " Jake told her . " Like you said , it sure is one fine evening to sit out here in the shade and drink a beer or two . " The music seemed louder than usual and the pace faster . " Down and up , " Michelle bellowed from the platform in front as she demonstrated proper squat form with her hands on her narrow hips . " Squeeze it all the way up . Imagine you 're picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your behind , and pull it up by the roots . Do n't let your knees get past your toes . Lower it , squeeze it up . Again . Again . " " Picking bluebonnets with your glutes ! " Molly Cates said to her daughter . " It 's illegal to pick bluebonnets  --  with any part of your anat-omy . " " Gross , " said Jo Beth Traynor , " but I wonder if it could be done . We could try . You know how people go out and take photographs of their children in the bluebonnets ? Maybe ? " " Okay , feet parallel now , " Michelle yelled over the thrum of the music . Glutes back and down , way down , and squeeze it up . Pick those bluebonnets ! " Molly watched herself in the mirrored wall . It was the one time you could stare at yourself in a mirror for an hour and not feel like a total narcissist . You were supposed to use the mirror to keep checking out your form on the exercises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this class , Molly had been watching with pleasure as her upper arms took on shape and firmness . Push-ups paying off . It was n't hard to see why people enjoyed bodybuilding . " Okay , " Michelle yelled , " now add a pelvic thrust to it . Squat down , thrust forward , and pull-1-1 up . " Molly smiled at herself in the mirror ; it sure did look ridiculous . Was the fight against gravity worth this indignity ? She looked at Michelle 's perfect , tanned , and muscled forty-seven-year-old legs in the orange Day-Glow very-short shorts and decided it was . Surely human vanity was one of the strongest forces in the world . " So , Mom , " Jo Beth said , " are you going to go out there to Jezreel and hang out with the barbarian hordes of reporters ? " " Definitely not . I can see it better on television . " " Dad seems really down about it . Frustrated like I 've never seen him . " " Yeah , he does . " Molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her ex-husband and current lover . Five days ago , when he 'd had a rare day off . Grady 'd been stressed , angry , and exhausted . A homicide lieutenant with the Austin police , for the past six weeks he 'd been on a team consulting with the FBI agents who were camped out in Jezreel trying to negotiate the release of Walter Demming and the eleven children . As the longtime head of APD 's hostage-negotiating team , Grady Traynor was considered skilled and experienced in the field , but nothing had prepared him for Samuel Mordecai . In the long weeks of negotiations , they had gotten zero concessions . " And , Mom , " Jo Beth said over the throbbing music , " he 's worried  | about leaving Copper alone so much while he 's still just getting ad-justed . " " Oh , God . That dog . " " Mom , he 's a retired public servant . " Jo Beth 's eyes shone with mirth . " He 's a vicious cur , a drooling , crazed sociopath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed the slightest interest in dogs and now in mid-life he takes on this demented beast . " " Mom , he was a hero , and they were going to kill him . " " I know , honey , but ? " " Yeah , he 's developed some bad habits . So he deserves a bullet in the brain ? Well , I think it 's wonderful of Dad to rescue Copper and I 'd really like to help , but Java and Luna have major problems with him . " " Of course they do . They 're sane dogs , basically . A bit rambunctious , but ? " Michelle yelled , " Get down into those legs now , lower ! Quads parallel to the floor . " Jo Beth bent her legs lower . " Dad was really hoping you might help out since you have that nice safe side yard and you 're at home working and you could ? " " No . Jo Beth , this is unfair . I do not want a dog , any dog , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't understand why your father committed to this . " Jo Beth smiled an indulgent smile . " Well , Mom , consider this theory of mine : Maybe Dad 's trying to build a family unit and he thinks this might help knit you together . " " Whaaat ? " Molly was stunned  --  on several levels . She did n't know where to start in refuting this wild theory . " Jo Beth , that 's crazy . First of all , he does n't want anything of the sort . Second , if he did want that , the last thing that would work is to bring a vicious attack dog into the equation . And third , he knows that , after three failed attempts at matrimony and domesticity , I 've renounced both . He knows that . I will never set up housekeeping again . Not with a man . And not with a dog . Never . " " Never ? If I 'm remembering correctly , that 's what you said last week about writing about Jezreel . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My boss gave me an assignment and helped me to see that it makes sense for me to do it . And now that I am , I find myself getting into it . It 's going to be okay . " " Well , I think the same thing would happen with Copper . He 'd be fine with a little ? " " No ! "  | From the front of the room , Michelle was shouting out , " All right , let 's go to the floor ! Push-up time ! " Molly and Jo Beth both arranged towels on the floor and got down on their hands and knees . " Knees apart , abs in tight , backs straight . Let 's do thirty for starters , " the instructor yelled over the pounding beat of salsa played in an aerobic tempo . " Oh , God , " Molly panted after three , " will this ever get any easier ? And is it worth it ? " " The ultimate eschatological questions , " Jo Beth said , pushing up and down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to talk to later  --  will there be push-ups in the millennium or will all true believers have muscles given unto them without labor or sweat ? " " I 'll ask him , " Molly retorted . " And how about this one : Do we get new bodies when we 're resurrected , or do we have to keep the same old flabby ones ? " " Well , Mom , I know this : If the world is ending in five days and we 're going to get new bodies , I 'd rather go out for pizza than do this crap . " " Yeah . " Molly was panting so hard she could barely speak . " If he says no push-ups for believers , I 'll convert on the spot . " The twangy redneck drawl over the phone immediately suggested to Molly a physical type : lean and spare , thin-lipped , squinch-eyed , and balding . " Ah am jet-lagged something awful , Miz Cates . This is not a real good time to talk . It may only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jerusalem and mah body thinks it 's still on Holy Land time and ah cai n't keep mah eyes open . " " Dr. Asquith , I would n't bother you now except that there 's so little time left in this Jezreel matter and Addie Dodgin feels you have some important insights into Samuel Mordecai 's theology . " " Any dang thing I might know about Mr. D. R. Grimes is strictly coincidental and against mah will . Miz Cates , just what is your interest in this matter ? " " I 'm writing an article about Samuel Mordecai for the publication I work for and ? " " What publication is that ? " In her darkened office , Molly stretched out on the love seat . She 'd been hoping he would n't ask . " Lone Star Monthly . " There was a silence , as though she 'd said Whips and Bondage . " Adeline did n't tell me that . You are n't the same person who wrote that story about two years back , are you ? "  | Molly closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I mean that one on cults in Texas that believe in the Apocalypse . " " Yes , I did write that article . " " Well , I have to tell you , Miz Cates , as a rule I try not to argue with or insult ladies , because I honor y'all , but in my opinion , that was a sorry piece of work  --  un-fair , un-godly , and un-forgivable . " " In what way was it unfair , Dr. Asquith ? " Molly kept her voice even . " You made it sound like anyone who believes in biblical prophecy and the coming Apocalypse is some crazy prevert like Donnie Ray Grimes . " " That surely was not my intention , Dr. Asquith . In the first paragraph of that article , I define the difference between a cult and a group of believers who might have a similar eschatology . I would be pleased to discuss it with you and hear your viewpoint . " " Well , that might be fruitful . I 'm coming to Austin tomorrow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe we could talk after that . " " Yes , I 'd like to . What time are you likely to be finished ? " " Shall we say seven o'clock ? The bar at Houston 's on Spicewood Springs . How about that , ma'am ? " " That 's fine . Dr. Asquith , before you go , could you tell me something about the Rapture of Mordecai ? " " Oh , were you listening to my radio show ? " " No . " " I just finished doing it live and it 's carried in the Austin area , so I thought you might have . How do you know about the Rapture of Mordecai ? " " A little from my interview with him and a little from Addie Dodgin . " " Oh , Adeline . . . Well , I decided that I 'd kept silent too long about the Jezreelites ' Satan-inspired false theology . It gives prophecy a bad name . " " So you talked about that on the radio ? " " Yes , ma'am . I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investigation , I can tell it to the faithful . " " How do you know about this rapture business , Dr. Asquith ? No one else has mentioned it . " " Like ah said . Coincidence . Accident . I made a real mistake back some seven years ago . At the Southwest Prophecy Conference , I ran into a young man who looked like an angel come down to earth . We got friendly and one night we got ourselves inebriated . See , I do n't indulge in spirits much and it 's a dangerous thing when I do . Same with him , I  | think . His tongue was loosened up and he told me this outlandish tale about him being the Prophet Mordecai who would help jump-start the Apocalypse . " " What was the tale ? " " Oh , it 's a long story . I 'll tell you tomorrow when we meet . I have got to " Would you just give me a summary of it now ? A quick and dirty version . " He laughed . " Quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oral tradition ? started during the 1830s , which you probably know was a time of great growth of sectarian invention in this country . A man named Saul Mordecai had a vision on his way to Texas  --  what he calls a rapture . God told Saul Mordecai he was a prophet who was to start the Apocalypse by establishing a Mordecai line . Not by giving birth , but by choosing the next prophet and telling him about this rapture he 'd had and passing on what they call the Heaven in Earth Vatic Gospel of the Jezreelite  --  a real mouthful , huh ? And heretical all the way . It was to get fulfilled in the fifth generation , and that , of course , is our current reigning Prophet Grimes , who believes he 's the Messiah . It 's a long , wild tale , but it has to do with fifty perfect saints of the Apocalypse and earth purification . And that 's really all I know . See you tomorrow evening , Miz Cates . " Before he could get away , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mordecai about this human-agency issue , but what about the rest of what he says ? About the Apocalypse . Do you believe it 's coming soon ? " He chuckled . " Of course . You obviously have n't read my books or my newsletters or seen my TV show . That 's my message , my lifework . It 's coming before the end of this millennium , within the next five years . And the strangest thing , Miz Cates , since I got back from the Holy Land last night , I 've had this feeling that it 's here , that it 's all winding down right now . Ca n't you just hear it and feel it ? " " No , I ca n't . Describe it for me , so I can understand . " " Well , it feels like a wind blowing me toward God . " After she put the phone down , Molly shook her head and murmured into the darkness , " It 's just jet lag . "  | The house was one of those stark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns . It looked like it had been made on a factory assembly line and then installed on a vacant lot that had been scraped clear of all debris . To finish it off , some toxic substance must have been sprinkled on the ground around it to ensure that nothing would grow within twenty yards  --  no trees , no grass , no flowers , no weeds ? just dust and rocks . Molly was ten minutes early , so she passed the place by and drove on to McDonald 's . The drive to Elgin had been quicker than she had figured , and from her several phone conversations with Dorothy Huff the night before , she had gotten the impression of an elderly woman who would not like people to arrive early  --  or late  --  or maybe at all . Once at the McDonald 's drive-through window , she felt a powerful urge to order an Egg McMuffin , but managed to fight it back by reminding herself that she had already eaten breakfast and that her favorite jeans had been so hard to zip up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She ordered a large coffee and sipped it sitting in her truck in the parking lot with the air conditioning going full-blast . The night before , Molly had decided to act right away on Thelma Bassett 's request . She would go see Dorothy Huff , the grandmother who had raised Donnie Ray Grimes to manhood . It was not easy to arrange . When she had called , Mrs. Huff had said she had never talked to a reporter and was n't about to start . She had talked to the FBI , but that  | was her duty as a God-fearing citizen . She had washed her hands of Donnie Ray Grimes , or whatever name he chose to call himself . Anyway , she was feeling too poorly for any of this . You would think , she 'd said , that people would be kind enough to leave a sick old lady alone . Then she had hung up . This was exactly the sort of rebuff that spurred Molly on . She had called Thelma Bassett and asked her to call Mrs. Huff and assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consultant who was helping Thelma to learn more about Samuel Mordecai so she might know what to say to him , when her chance came . Thelma had done this and added that since Mrs. Huff had been so gracious as to offer her help this was what she could do to help  --  talk to Molly . Dorothy Huff was no pushover , though ; her answer was still no  --  until Molly promised never to write a word about Mrs. Huff . Molly also had to promise that the interview would not be stressful . Molly leaned out of the truck to dump the undrunk half of her coffee in the gutter . How would it be possible to talk about Samuel Mordecai without it being stressful to the woman who 'd raised him ? she wondered . At ten exactly she rang Dorothy Huff 's doorbell . The gaunt , grayhaired woman who answered the door started speaking immediately , with no greeting or preamble . " Since you 've drove all the way from Austin , I 'm gon na try to get through this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightly know if I 'm up to it . " Her words were directed several feet to the left of where Molly was standing . " Some days is worse than others . " She turned and shuffled in her brown carpet slippers across the sparsely furnished living room . " The knees is just as bad as the sacroiliac today . I knowed from when I first opened my eyes before the sun come up and the pain started in so horrible I tell ya most people could n't take it . I never should 've gotten out of that bed . Anyone in their right mind , sick as I am , would 've just laid there . But then the good Lord knows not everyone does their Christian duty in this world . I told that poor Mrs. Bassett I wanted to help her and she asked me to talk to you , so talk I will . I never been one to baby myself . Never had that luxury . No , ma'am . Always had too much work to get done , keeping a clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velveteen recliner that faced a television set with a 35-inch screen . " Oh , there it is , hitting me bad  --  the arthritis , in both knees . Ow , Jesus . All this stress " ? she waved a hand in Molly 's direction ? " makes it worse'n usual . " She dropped into the recliner with a ploof sound . " Might as well take the load off , huh , Mrs. . . . " " Cates , " Molly said . " Molly Cates . " The stench of stale smoke and old cigarette butts , only slightly masked by Lysol spray , filled her nostrils , but when Molly glanced around there was no sign of an ashtray or a  | cigarette pack , or even a lighter . A secret smoker . " Thank you for talking to me , Mrs. Huff . I sure am sorry to hear you 're feeling poorly . " " Well , it 's not like that 's your headline news . Been going on a long time now , long as I can remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good Lord shovels onto you . Nothing for it but to grin and bear it . " To demonstrate her fortitude , she grinned in Molly 's direction . Then she relaxed in the chair and her thin lips snapped back to a pursed , sour position . Molly fought off a sudden impulse to run to her truck and drive away . Everything about this house and this woman made her want to bolt . But Dorothy Huff , however unappealing , was surely going through hell . Molly had recently read an article by the father of a serial killer . He had written that when you 're a parent , you think the worst thing in the world is to get a call in the middle of the night saying that your child has been murdered by a madman . He had learned , to his everlasting anguish , that there was something even worse . Samuel Mordecai 's grandmother , the woman who had reared him , must be experiencing some of that now . Molly looked around for a place to sit . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . She sat on the end and said with total sincerity , " This sure must be a difficult time for you . " For the first time , Mrs. Huff looked directly at Molly . Her thin , horsey face was scored with cruel ruts that all slanted downward . " Well , honey , you just do n't know what difficult is . You raise up a boy best you can , teach him to be a good Christian God-fearing boy , and then something like this happens and people say behind your back , well , it must be that Dorothy Huff did n't raise him up right for him to go and do a thing like that . " Her mouth tightened up so hard that her lips whitened . " Even though the boy is no blood kin of yours , and you never asked to get saddled with him . " " Mrs. Huff , " Molly said , " I think most parents who have children over the age of ten understand that anything can happen when you are raising a child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The old woman 's mouth relaxed a fraction . " Well , ai n't that the truth ? " " It was so kind of you to call Thelma Bassett , Mrs. Huff . It meant a lot to her . She 's a fine woman and she needs some help right now . She thinks she might get a chance to talk to . . . Donnie Ray . You still call him Donnie Ray ? " Mrs. Huff nodded . " When I call him anything . " " She wants to know what she might say to him that would persuade  | him to release the children . She thinks that maybe his being adopted might figure some way in this situation . " Dorothy Huff looked hard at Molly . " Before this goes any farther , we need to get something real clear . You know I do n't talk to no newspaper or TV people or none of that kind . " " Yes , you told me on the phone . And I appreciate your ? " " Hold on , missy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly . " Just hold on with all your appreciates and such . Let 's get one thing clear . You promised not to talk of this to anyone but Mrs. Bassett . I mean to no one . You clear on that ? " Molly felt bruised by the woman 's bullying manner . " Yes , if that 's what you want . " Dorothy Huff slapped her hands down hard on the arms of her chair . " If that 's what I want ? It 's not a matter of wanting , missy . You break that promise and I 'm dead , Mrs. Cates . And you , too , most likely . " " Dead ? " " Yes , ma'am , you put in the newspaper I said any of this , and I 'm deader than Saturday 's meat loaf . " Molly felt the force of the woman 's certainty and her fear . " Who would kill you ? " " I thought you knew something about cults , Mrs. Writer Woman . " " I know something about them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this group Donnie Ray 's got hisself involved in do n't cotton to people talking about their business . Ai n't you wondered why there are no ex-members coming forward to tell about the group ? " Molly felt a flush of heat . She had indeed wondered about it . Two years ago when she was writing the cult article , she had searched for former Hearth Jezreelites who would talk about Samuel Mordecai and what really went on behind the fences at Jezreel . She had gotten one or two leads , but never found a willing talker at the end of those leads . And the FBI intelligence gatherers were having the same problem now . " Like Annette . " The old woman shook her head . " You think she 'd ever say word one about what life was like there or why she run off ? " " Annette ? You mean Donnie Ray 's wife  --  Annette Grimes ? " " Who else ? Pretty little Annette . " " She is n't inside the compound ? " Molly was stunned . " Nope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Months ago . Sent me a postcard saying goodbye and thanking me for being nice to her . I was nice to her , too , always liked Annette . Too good for Donnie Ray , if you ask me . " " Where is Annette now ? "  | Dorothy Huff gave a snort that might have been an incipient laugh . " Who knows ? She 's no dummy . I suppose the Sword Hand of God might have tracked her and she 's dead now . " " Sword Hand of God ? Is that what he calls cult members on the outside ? " " Yes . They do n't want to have all their eggs in one basket . " " Where are they , Mrs. Huff , and what do they do ? " " They 're all over , probably some back in Austin where you come from . Probably some around here . They work outside and send their paychecks home to Jezreel . The main thing they do is make sure that members who get fed up and leave never talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashed it across her throat . " How do you know this ? " " I used to visit Donnie Ray and Annette at Jezreel . Back before it got to be too much for me . I heard talk . " " Why did Annette leave ? " " She just said she had to go and could never get in touch with me again , and she hoped I 'd understand . And I do . I hope you do , too , Mrs. Cates . " " Yes , Mrs. Huff , I do . Nothing you tell me will go beyond me and Mrs. Bassett . I promise . " Dorothy Huff relaxed her head back onto the chair . " Well , all right , then . " " Is it true that Donnie Ray was adopted by your daughter ? " Molly asked . " Sure is . Just like I told poor Mrs. Bassett when I phoned her up . " " I 'm wondering why you did n't tell anyone this before . " " Oh , mercy . Evelyn  --  that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know she could n't have a baby on her own . Made her feel less womanly , I guess . So she went away to Austin and come back in a coupla months with this baby and claimed she had him there . I just went along with her story and it got to be a habit , I guess . We never talked about it , and no one asked . " " You did n't tell the FBI when they came to see you ? " " No , ma'am . Never thought about it . " " Is Thelma the first person you 've told ? " " I guess so . What happened was I saw her on the TV set , so sweet and alone , and I had this vision I should call her and explain it all . So I did . Like you say , anything can happen with children growing up nowadays and particularly when you really do n't know where they come from , I mean where they got their blood from . They could come from any sort  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I just wanted her to know that Donnie Ray was n't really my own kin . " " Yes , I see . Evelyn adopted him in Austin ? " " That 's what she said . " " She was married at the time , was n't she ? " " Well , sure . Back then , were n't no adoption by unmarried people like happens now with preverts and all them trash kind of people adopting these innocent little babies . Is n't that just a crime , Mrs. Cates , them homosexuals adopting babies ? " The woman stopped and looked at Molly , raising her eyebrows and tipping her chin up expectantly . Molly kept her face neutral and waited it out . Mrs. Huff went on : " No , back then you had to be married and go for interviews and have some religious background . Evelyn was married to Jimmy Grimes . " A grimace of disgust twisted her face . " That man was worthless . Him and Evelyn dropped the burden on me without so much as a by-your-leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up children is work . You 're all the time spooning food into them and cleaning it up as it mucks out of them . You have to put the fear of God almighty into them to keep them on a righteous path . Yes , ma'am , you have to teach them right from wrong , clean from unclean  --  all them things . It is righteous work , for sure . " For the first time since she had met Samuel Mordecai , Molly felt a pang of pity for him , or , rather , for Donnie Ray Grimes , the little boy who had had no choice but to depend on this woman . She had just a glimmer why someone would grow up longing for the world to end in fire and catastrophe . " So Donnie Ray lived with you from then on ? " Dorothy Huff let her head drop back on the chair , as if the subject were too heavy to support . " Yes , ma'am . Never lived a day with his mama after that . And Donnie always said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gramma . This is my home . You take such good care of me , Gramma . Do n't let my mother have me . ' Well , no danger of that . She never asked for him , not once , never wanted him . He lived here with me in this house until he got to be seventeen and then he run off on me . Hardly said goodbye , never finished grade school , even , never held a real job , left all his junk here . " " His father  --  Jimmy Grimes  --  he 's been dead for some years , has n't he ? " " Oh , a long time . He got himself killed shortly after he run off . " She stuck out her lower lip as if that helped her to remember . " Got drunk and run his truck off the road . It was God 's judgment . Jimmy Grimes pulled it down on hisself with both hands . Sure did . He ruined my daughter , never did live up to a obligation in all his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Evelyn ? " Molly had read that Evelyn Huff Grimes had turned to prostitution and died of a drug overdose . The woman sighed . " Well . Evelyn . She stayed out there in that Las Vegas . Never wrote or called , not on my birthday or Donnie Ray 's neither . She . . . she got sick and died . Twelve years ago . You knew that , I reckon . " Molly nodded . " I read it . Did Donnie see much of her before she died ? " " Only once in all them years . He went out there to see her one time . " " To Las Vegas ? When was that ? " " About four months before she died . When he was twenty-one . Just before he started in on all that preaching and apocalypsing business . I told him not to go , but he upped and hitched out there and he come back changed , I can tell you that  --  full of fury , brimstone . Had him a vision , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mor-de-cai . And ever since then he 's been apocalypsing and doing all them cult things you read about in the newspaper . " " It sounds like you do n't hold with Donnie Ray 's beliefs , Mrs. Huff . " " I 'm a good Christian woman . I believe every precious word the Bible says . I believe that Jesus will return to earth to judge the wicked , but the Bible says no one can know the hour or the day , not even Donnie Ray Grimes , who now says he 's Sam-u-el Mor-de-cai , thank you very much . My preacher says the boy do n't hold to the Bible , he goes too far into his own imaginings  --  always did . His religion is more Donnie Ray Grimes than our Lord Jesus Christ . " " What advice can you give Mrs. Bassett ? How can she make an appeal to him ? " Dorothy Huff shrugged . " Do n't matter what she says . He do n't listen , anyways . " " Mrs. Huff , what can you tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to her cheek as if she 'd just been slapped . " What do you mean ? " " Well , do you know who his birth parents are ? I 'd like to locate them . I think it might be helpful . " " Birth parents ? " She repeated it as if she were trying to figure out the meaning . " Oh , his real folks , you mean . No . I do n't know nothing about that . " " Do you know where Evelyn adopted him ? " " I already told you . She went off to Austin . " " Yes , but where in Austin ? Did she mention the name of an agency ? Or was it maybe a private adoption from a lawyer ? "  | Dorothy Huff 's bony hands tightened on the arms of the chair , as if it were about to be launched into space and she needed to hold on for dear life . The veins in the backs of her hands stuck out like black worms . " She never told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough to raise up this child but not to know where he come from . When I asked to know what sort of people he come from , she said nobody knowed . " " Nobody ? " " Nobody . " " But somebody would know , " Molly said , thinking aloud . " The agency , or wherever she adopted him from , might not tell her , but they would know where he came from . " " She said he was abandoned . " " Abandoned ? " Molly felt the stirring of interest like an electric buzz in her chest . " That 's what she said . " Molly was almost afraid to ask the next question because if the answer was no , then this could be a dead end . " Are there some papers about the adoption somewhere ? " Mrs. Huff set her mouth into its determined downward arc . " Papers . Have n't thought about those since Donnie Ray asked me the last time . " She looked down at the threadbare blue rug . Molly waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't stand it anymore . " Are there some papers , Mrs. Huff ? With dates and names ? Something that might help us ? " She looked up and Molly was surprised to see tears in her faded blue eyes . " Mrs. Bassett said you 'd be nice and kindly and not ask me hurtful things . This is all so hard to remember . " Molly leaned forward , following her instinct to close in tight to extract information . She did not like inflicting pain , but if she needed to , she would walk over this woman 's body with hobnailed boots to find out what she needed to know . " Mrs. Huff , the last thing I want to do here is hurt you with my questions , but this might really help us help those children . Do you have any papers here that relate to Donnie Ray 's adop-tion ? " Mrs. Huff crossed her arms over her bony chest . " Well , I might have . " Molly decided to back off and approach from a different direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did he search ? " The grooves running from Dorothy Huff 's nose to her downturned mouth deepened into valleys of bitterness . " Did he ? He come to me when he was seventeen and he was getting all puffed up and big for his  | britches , you know the way they do , and he said he wanted to find out where he come from and would I help him . I was against it . For his own good , Mrs. Cates . For his own good . I knew for sure it would lead noplace . And even if he did find something out , it would just be trash he 'd find . " She let out a huge sigh . " It sure beats me why you 'd go to all that trouble to find someone who did n't never want you in the first place . I told him so . And I told him it sure did hurt me bad that he wanted to find some other family , that I was n't good enough for him . " Molly said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are adopted  --  wanting to make some connection with birth parents . " " I reckon . I never seen him that het up . He wanted to find his mother in the worst way . Upset him bad when it happened just like I told him and he could n't find nothing out . " " What happened ? " " Well , he went off to Austin and run into a brick wall . See , you have to be twenty-one to see your records . He fussed and carried on trying to get me to sign , and when Donnie gets to wanting something , I can tell you there ai n't many in the world can stand up to him , but I did what was best for him . And turns out I was right . " There were so many questions Molly wanted to ask , she did n't know where to begin . " What was it he wanted you to sign ? " " Oh , so he could see his records . If the parent signs , someone under twenty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Las Vegas , so he wanted me to do it . But I was n't the mother and had n't never adopted him , so I do n't think me signing would 've worked anyway , but he sure wanted me to do that . " She took a deep breath from having talked so fast . " He just had to wait to twenty-one and it did n't make no difference because when the time come , there was nothing to find out . Just like I told him . " She said it with grim satisfaction . " Nothing to find out ? " " The day that boy turned twenty-one , he went back to that state adoption place and he demanded his file . Of course , it did n't tell him nothing , really , just like I told him . " " Did you see that adoption file , Mrs. Huff ? " " Well , sure . They give him a copy . He come here waving it around and carrying on . He followed me around the house , getting me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read so good . He kept on pushing . He wanted to find his real mother in the worst way . But the record did n't give him nothing to go on . So he took it out on me . As if I had anything to do with it . See what happens , Mrs. Cates  --  you do the best you can and you get blamed for everything good you done . "  | " It does sound unfair for him to blame you , " Molly said , desperate to keep her talking . " What information was in his file ? " " Well , not much . Like Evelyn said , he was left abandoned , just hours old when he was found , throwed out like a piece of garbage . " " What was the date ? " " It was 1962 . August the third . " " Who found him ? " " Some man , just passing by the creek . " " The creek ? " " Waller Creek , down there near the university , in Austin . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man said . Moses . You ever heard anything like that ? " " Floating in the creek ? " Molly heard herself repeating everything like an idiot , but each revelation stunned her so much she had to check she 'd heard it right . " In one of them Styrofoam beer cooler things . Do n't that beat all ? Moses in a beer cooler . " Molly was n't sure whether she believed it or not , but her entire skin surface tingled . She needed to find out more about this , much more . But there was a problem looming : Adoption records in Texas were closed ; nothing short of a court order could get you access through official channels . Her only hope was right here , to extract everything there was to get from this woman . She leaned forward . " Mrs. Huff , this is very important . Do you still have that adoption file ? " Dorothy Huff 's face got hard as Mount Rushmore . " Maybe . " " I 'd like to read it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would n't do you no good . If he could n't find nothing , you could n't neither . " " Not necessarily . One of the things I do in my work is research . I 'm pretty good at it , but I need some information to start me off . Do you have it ? " She looked down at her old brown slippers . " He might 've left it here with his other junk , but if he found out I showed it to you , he 'd have me killed , his own granny . " " Mrs. Huff , I would n't show it to anyone else . I 'd just use it as a starting point for my research . " The woman shook her head . " Mrs. Huff , you told Mrs. Bassett you would do anything you could to help . Well , this is how you can help her . " Molly made herself add , " And little Kimberly . Those children are what 's important here , are n't they ? "  | " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see how this would help them . " Molly was afraid of this question , because she was n't sure either . But she needed to answer it because she certainly did want that file . " Well , the negotiators who are talking to Donnie Ray are having trouble communicating with him . They 've tried everything they know how to do to get him to give up those children . Now they are thinking of letting Thelma Bassett and maybe some of the other parents talk to him , try to get him to see he needs to let those children go before something awful happens . If we could locate his birth mother , maybe she could talk to him , too . We need to try this . Let me look at the file , Mrs. Huff . It might make a difference . Really . " It was as close to begging as she liked to get . Dorothy Huff set her mouth in its extreme downward arc again . Molly was sure she was going to say no . " Well , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those negotiators ca n't talk no sense into him . I never could neither . I reckon I could take a look , see if he left it with the rest of his junk , but it ai n't gon na do you no good . " She struggled up out of the chair . " Oh , lordy , " she moaned , teetering on scrawny legs , " I should be in bed . " Molly reached out to take her elbow . " Let me help you . " " No , no . " Mrs. Huff shook her hand off . " I ai n't used to no help . " She walked painfully to the door that led into a hallway . " I 'll look , but I do n't guarantee nothing . " She disappeared into a room off the hall and softly closed the door . Feeling edgy , Molly got to her feet . If Mrs. Huff could n't or would n't find the file , this search might dead-end right here . She looked out the picture window to a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade of grass or a weed growing from the dusty earth . She switched her attention to the room . On a table under the picture window sat one object : an acrylic square for holding photographs . There was only one picture in it  --  a black-haired girl with a heart-shaped face and lovely blue eyes . Annette Grimes . Molly recognized her from news photos . There was no other decoration in the room . No pictures on the wall , no photographs of Donnie Ray as a child , no books , no newspapers , no magazines . Not even a Bible . Just a big television , a sofa , a table , and the gold recliner . A motel room had more warmth . Molly turned when she heard the shuffling tread in the hall . To her delight , Dorothy Huff carried some papers in her hand . " All that bending down and dust is real bad for me , but here it is , for what it 's worth . I surely do hope you 're a woman of your word . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . Molly felt like kissing the yellowed hand . " Thank you , Mrs. Huff.  | Thelma Bassett will appreciate this and I surely do . May I keep it and send it back in a few days ? " Now all she wanted to do was escape this house , and find a quiet place to sit and read the file . Of course , she should stay a while , interview this woman , listen to stories of what a burden Donnie Ray was as a baby , how wicked he was as a toddler , how unfair it had all been . The problem was , she could n't bear to hear it . Anyway , she 'd promised not to write anything about Dorothy Huff . " Mrs. Huff , you 've been very kind . I need to be getting back to Austin now . " She reached out to shake the woman 's hand , but Dorothy Huff had already turned and shuffled toward the door . Molly followed . Getting into her truck , Molly felt the old tingle of the hunt vibrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she got back to Austin to read the file , so she headed back to McDonald 's , back to the drivethrough window . This time she ordered an Egg McMuffin . She was in the nick of time , just minutes before the ten-thirty end to breakfast . She parked and sipped the orange juice as she looked at the first page of the slender file . It was labeled as property of the Department of Public Welfare of Travis County , which apparently handled adoptions back in 1962 . At the top it said " Case Number 3459987 ? Baby Boy Waller , later named Donnie Ray Grimes . " Molly thumbed through the six pages . Her heart sank . On every page there were words blacked out . She put her Egg McMuffin , still wrapped , on the dashboard and studied the inked-out words . They were all names , last names . Someone had inked out all the important names  --  the name of the man who found the infant , the name of another witness who saw the man find the infant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . She felt like banging her head against the steering wheel . If she had any hope of tracing the person who abandoned the baby , those were the names she needed . Her first reaction was a rush of anger . That old witch Dorothy Huff had done this . But then she calmed down and decided it might have been done by the welfare department . They probably did it to keep the identity of the birth parents confidential . But in this case no one knew who the parents were , so what did it matter ? Well , she certainly intended to find out . She settled back to read the file . The story was essentially as Mrs. Huff had told her . There was a sketchy police summary describing the infant being found by a man jogging along Waller Creek . The policeman who responded to the call immediately took the infant to Brackenridge Hospital and called the county to come and take over . A caseworker 's report picked up the story from there . The infant , a six-pound male , approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy . He spent only one day in the hospital , and was then placed in a foster family . There was a lengthy part she skimmed over about the baby 's health and the financial arrangements with the foster parents . Attached at the end were the court records concerning the termination of parental rights when the infant was two months old , and the adoption by James and Evelyn Grimes . Molly read it through at warp speed . Then she went back and read it again , slowly . It was frustrating because with the crucial names missing it was like trying to get your footing on a glass cliff ; there was nothing to grab on to . But she kept reading and got rewarded with something she 'd sped over the first time : At the end of the police summary was a line saying , " Male infant and found effects given over to the custody of Public Welfare case worker . " Found effects ! Something was found with the baby ? She read through the rest of the report carefully searching for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked at the Egg McMuffin on the dashboard and decided she did n't want it after all . What she needed now was some information on how adoptions like this were handled , and she did n't want to wait until she got back to Austin . She used her car phone to get an Austin operator to look up the number for the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services . Then she managed , after several tries , to get an adoption supervisor on the line . " Susie Garcia . How can I help you ? " " This is Molly Cates , Miz Garcia . I work for Lone Star Monthly magazine , " she said in the brisk , professional tone she assumed for extracting information from bureaucrats . It was a tone that assumed she had the right to anything she requested . " I need some information on adoption procedure for an article I 'm writing and I wonder if you could help me . " " Well , I 'll try , ma'am . " Molly decided to start off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miz Garcia , I know that adoption records in Texas are sealed . But what does that mean in actual practice ? " " It means that adoption records are closed to everyone except the adult adoptee and the adoptive parents . " " I see . This woman I 'm writing about  --  she 's an adult adoptee  --  got a copy of her file , but it has lots of names blacked out . Do you do that ? " " Of course . We have to de-identify the file before we give it to the adoptee . " " De-identify ? "  | " Well , yes . To protect the privacy of the birth parents . " " Yes , I see why you 'd do that , but on this file , other names are blacked out , too . " " Well , ma'am , that would probably be because those people might be able to give information that could lead to exposing the identity of the birth parents . " " But in this woman 's case , " Molly persisted , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why would the file be de-identified if there 's no identity known ? " " Well , it 's our policy . I suppose it 's done so that the adoptee is not even tempted to try a search . It would be a waste of time anyway . If we could n't find the birth parents , she could n't either . " " How hard do you look in a case like that , with an abandoned in-fant ? " " The law just says we are required to conduct due and diligent search . We give it a good try . If we ca n't find the parents after several months we go to court to have the parental rights terminated so we can put the child up for adoption . " " In the meantime the child is in foster care ? " " That 's right . " " What about the original file ? That 's not de-identified , is it ? " " Well , of course not . We keep the original in our files with all names intact , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garcia , when an infant is abandoned , as in the case I 'm writing about , your agency takes custody of the baby , right ? " " Yes . " " What happens to any clothes or items that might be left with the baby ? " " Funny you should ask . We had one just a few weeks ago . A newborn baby girl left in the Kmart parking lot with seven jars of strained prunes , a plastic nursing bottle , and a beautiful silver St. Christopher medal . What we did in that case was toss the prunes because we worried about contamination . But the medal and the bottle we gave to the foster mother when we put the baby into her care . " " Then what ? The baby will get adopted , wo n't she ? " " If we do n't find the birth parents , and we have n't so far . Oh , yes , she 'll get adopted . In a flash . She 's a real sweetheart . " " Then what will happen to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The foster mother gives it to the adoptive mother . Such objects often turn out to be very precious , you know  --  the only link that child has  | with its birth parents . So we make an effort to preserve everything we can . " " So anything abandoned with the baby would end up with the adoptive parents ? " " Yes , eventually . That 's what usually happens . " " Would that have been true back in the sixties , too ? " " I imagine . I do n't go back that far . This sounds interesting . What 's the article about ? " " Oh , it 's just the story of a woman who was adopted in the sixties and has been searching for her parents . " To prepare herself for the ordeal of another dose of Dorothy Huff , Molly fortified herself with more coffee . She decided not to phone first because she wanted to watch the woman 's reaction to her questions . When Mrs. Huff opened the door this time , she held a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Molly . " Mrs. Huff , " Molly said . " I hate to bother you again , but there 's just one more favor I need to ask . I stopped at McDonald 's for lunch , and I read the file there . It mentions something about the effects found with the infant . I wonder if I could take a look at them before I drive back . " Mrs. Huff assumed a quizzical look . " Effects ? " " Yes . You know , the things left with Donnie Ray when he was aban-doned . " The old woman stood perfectly still , the only movement the smoke from her cigarette drifting up her arm . " It says that in the file ? " " Yes , in the police report . " Mrs. Huff turned without speaking and walked inside , wafting smoke behind her . Molly followed without being invited . She watched the woman walk to the gold chair and mash the cigarette into a coffee cup that was sitting on the arm . " Well , " Dorothy Huff said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooler , you know . I told you that . But it was old even then , and just one of them cheap ones you get at gas stations , and it just dried up and fell to bits some years ago . I threw it out . " Molly followed a hunch . " What about the other things ? " " You mean that thing he was wrapped in ? " " Yes . " Molly 's heart fluttered . " Do you still have it ? " " Just an old robe . Nothing to see . " " Will you get it for me , please ? " Dorothy Huff 's face hardened into a stubborn look that worried Molly . " I really do n't see ? "  | " Please , just let me look . It might be helpful in the search . For Mrs. Bassett and little Kimberly , " she added . Dorothy Huff sighed , but once again she turned and shuffled off . This time she was muttering something about if she 'd known how much trouble all this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged . She was gone longer this time and there was still nothing to look at in the living room . Except the coffee cup . Molly walked over and peered inside . There were six cigarette butts . Six in the forty minutes since Molly had left . The woman had a prodigious habit . Finally Mrs. Huff returned carrying a flat white cardboard box about the size you 'd get if you bought a sweater at Foley 's . Molly wanted to grab it and run , but she stood patiently as the woman carried it across the room . She set it down on the table gingerly , as if it contained live rattlesnakes . She put her hands on the box , then paused . " Mrs. Cates , are you a saved woman ? " Molly did n't hesitate . " No , Mrs. Huff . I imagine it 's a great comfort to those who are , but I seem unable to believe in anything I ca n't see . " Mrs. Huff nodded as if that was exactly what she 'd expected to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside to let Molly look inside . It was a garment made of a shiny red fabric , neatly folded . " See , " she said in a hushed voice , " that 's it . " " Would you take it out for me ? " Molly asked . Mrs. Huff sighed . She reached in and lifted it out . Holding it with her fingertips , she gave it a shake to open the folds . It was a kimono , clearly old , but still a vivid red . Slowly Mrs. Huff turned it to show Molly the back . Embroidered there was a huge multicolored dragon , coiled in a circle . It had lots of heads and tongues . Molly was amazed : Thirty-three years it had sat in the box and the colors were still vivid , gaudy even . " The mark of the Beast , " Dorothy Huff intoned . A dampish , musty smell emanated from the garment . It took several seconds for Molly to make the connection . Beasts  --  Samuel Mordecai talked a lot about beasts . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrapped in the mantle of the Beast . My God . Was he referring to this , to being a baby wrapped in this gaudy garment and put out to die ? She had assumed it was metaphorical talk , images from Revelation , but it was literal . She thought about a little boy whose only connection with the mother who gave him birth was this . Her heart was thud-ding . " When did Donnie Ray first see this , Mrs. Huff ? " And then she asked a question she should have asked the first time she was here . " And when did he learn about the details of his abandonment and adoption ? " " Well , let me see . " Dorothy Huff stuck her bottom lip out , an affec-  | tation Molly now recognized as a pose of trying to remember . " Everybody says you should tell children they been adopted early on . So I told Donnie Ray , oh , maybe when he was two or three . You know , when he could understand . " " Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am . And I showed him this . Had to warn him . You know , while there was still time . " " Warn him ? " " Yes . " She shook the kimono in front of Molly 's face . " About the Beast and how careful he had to be to overcome this evil sign , this early influence . " " Early influence ? " She looked at Molly with exasperation , as if she were a very slow child . " Well , you can see what with starting out life like this , marked in this terrible way , it was important for him to be careful . So when he was bad , I 'd have to show him this to remind him of his inheritance . I had to warn him . Children are forgetful , so I had to do it often . " Molly did n't know if she could bear to hear more , but she said , " You 'd warn him about this robe ? " " The image of the Beast , Mrs. Cates . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of birth , the ancient serpent who leads the whole world astray . The Book of Revelation . You not being a Christian woman , I suppose you do n't know much about them things , but the boy was born under the image of the Beast , and he needed special han-dling . " Molly knew she should follow up , ask about the special handling , but she did n't think she could take it right now . " Mrs. Huff , if I 'm very careful , could I take this with me ? I 'll get it back to you with the file in a few days . " " Well ... " " It could be important for helping the children at Jezreel . " " Take it , then . " She flapped a hand . " This has just wore me out . I was just fixing to lay down for a nap . " " Of course . I wo n't keep you . Thanks for your help , Mrs. Huff . " Molly left the house with the box under her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure her Fuzzbuster was working . Then she rolled down the windows and pushed the speedometer up to seventy . She turned on her new Rolling Stones tape with the volume at full blast  --  ungodly , satanic music to drive out the smell of Dorothy Huff 's house , she thought , as the hot wind blew through the cab and whipped her hair wildly around her head .  | Josh was wheezing , curled tight against Kim , who had her cheek pressed against his damp head . " Tell me if you want to be alone , Josh , " she was saying . " I know when it 's bad , you do n't like anyone to be too close . " " It 's okay , " he gasped between wheezes . " It 's okay now . " The wheezing had begun in earnest right after he 'd eaten his cereal and milk . It was n't good for Josh to drink milk , but it was all they 'd been getting , so there was no choice . Josh had explained to Walter early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drank it only occasionally . Walter had explained this to Martin and begged him to bring Josh something different . But Martin ignored the request . It was always Martin who brought their meals , never anyone else . Twice a day he 'd drop down the hole , reach up , and lift a cardboard carton down . One meal , the first of the day , was invariably cereal and milk . Sometimes the second meal was cereal and milk , too . But every second or third day the carton held peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on white bread and milk . Once a week they got a banana or an apple . They always had a jug of water that sat on the driver 's seat and each of them had a plastic cup . And that was it for food and drink . For forty-seven days , it had sustained life , but they were all ready to scream from the boredom . If you tried to design a worse situation for a kid like Josh , you could n't do it , Walter thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : stuffy , bad air , a closed-in space underground , milk and cereal every  | day , constant stress  --  not just Samuel Mordecai preaching his blood statues and cataclysm all the time , not just being captives , but living in such close quarters , with all the squabbling and friction among the kids . And , of course , no medication  --  that was the worst thing . When Josh 's yellow plastic inhaler had run out after the first week , his attacks got more severe and more frequent . In desperation Walter had filled the empty inhaler with water and got Josh to mist that into his throat . At first , the inhaler was probably picking up some residue of the medication , but by now it was straight water . Still , it seemed to give him some relief . Now Kim held up the inhaler , which Josh always kept on the seat next to him . " Do you want another puff , Joshy ? " The boy took the inhaler , held it to his mouth , and pressed . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hummed to him softly . She did n't carry a tune well , but Walter thought the song was that old Cat Stevens song " Morning Has Broken . " The humming seemed to soothe him . By trial and error , Kim and Walter had developed a desperate repertoire of techniques to help Josh through his breathing difficulties . The problem was they had so little to work with . In general , they had so little . The first day down here , Martin and another man had come through the bus taking their backpacks , purses , and anything they saw that looked like it might contain dangerous or ungodly items . The only things that got left behind were the few items that happened to be out of their packs and out of sight when the confiscation occurred . And these objects had become intensely precious over the weeks  --  Brandon 's math book ; Sandra 's novel , Stuart Little ; Bucky 's Mighty Morphin Power Ranger action figure ; Sue Ellen 's string box ; Walter 's towel and the pad of paper and pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pog collection , something Walter had never seen before ? little cardboard circles ; Heather 's packet of scrunchies for securing hair . Kim 's pink comb with the little mirror on it . The kids were amazingly inventive at figuring out ways to amuse themselves , using what they had . They were indeed the television generation ; lots of their play revolved about TV shows , acting out Power Ranger scenarios and cartoon characters . One particularly therapeutic activity Walter enjoyed was watching them act out what the Power Rangers would do to the Hearth Jezreelites . Even though television shaped some of their fantasies , it seemed to Walter that when necessity arose , they had all the resourcefulness of frontier kids . They sang , invented games , squabbled , listened to his story , argued about it , and played cat 's cradle and rock , paper , scissors  --  games he remembered from his childhood . They breathed onto the windows to fog them and played ticktacktoe . They made paper airplanes and triangles and had contests with  | them , keeping running scores on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paper was at a premium . Because Walter was saving the ten sheets left on his pad for an emergency , they talked Brandon out of the index pages in the back of his math book . At first Brandon was scandalized by the suggestion that he tear a page out of a schoolbook , but the kids got Walter to support them in saying this was such a special situation that the school would be unlikely to punish him for defacing the book . This morning , Conrad and Brandon sat in the doorway moving buttons they had torn off their clothes around on a checkerboard Walter had drawn on the cardboard backing from his writing pad . Heather had been braiding Sue Ellen 's long black hair until they 'd gotten into a fight over who had left the cup of water in the aisle to get knocked over . Hector and Lucy were playing with Conrad 's pogs . Sandra read her book . When Walter asked her how many times she 'd read it , her answer was that it was n't the sort of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip 's seat trying to interest him in talking to his Power Ranger doll . Philip showed no interest in Power Rangers or anything else . He was leaning against the window , his eyes closed . Walter did n't know what to do about Philip . He had n't gotten up from his seat today and he had n't eaten his cereal . For at least a week , Walter had n't heard him utter a word . He was slipping away , getting dimmer and dimmer . If they were set free today , Walter wondered , would he ever recover ? Would any of them ? When Josh 's wheezing finally eased , he said softly , " Hey , Mr. Demming , let 's hear about Jacksonville . " " Good idea , " Kim said . " Okay , " Walter said . " How about some story , kids ? " There was general agreement to have story time . Brandon stood , got some water from the thermos , and wandered to the back . The hard-core eight gathered at the front and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hunkered down in the aisle . He waited for the story to come and fill him up . The way he did it was to back up in his mind to the last installment and remember where he 'd left Jacksonville . Then it felt like the story was just drawn out of him by the waiting kids . He smiled at them , sitting there waiting for him to start . It occurred to him that he enjoyed storytelling and that he 'd never again have an audience as eager as this one . " The rain , " he said . " The yellow rain that came so suddenly and then just stopped . As soon as the Tongs ran back to their hootches , it stopped . Just like that . Jacksonville had never seen a rain like that . And it had been such a funny yellowish color . But he was thankful for it . Dr. Mortimer was still alive .  | " But then , sitting alone in the dark , he started feeling sad and hopeless again . Nothing had really changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be no sudden , miraculous rain to stop it . So what difference did it make ? Tonight or tomorrow  --  it was all the same . He thought about the big Tong warrior laughing and drawing his finger across his throat . He gave up the idea of sleeping and just sat there in his cage , scared and miserable . Waiting to die . In a way that 's what life was , he thought just waiting to die . Maybe it would be tomorrow when the sun came up , or maybe when the sun went down . But he would die . Jacksonville had never really felt that before : certain that he would die ? sometime . It made him wonder what all the effort was for , all this searching , trying to find Dr. Mortimer . It all just ends in a cooking pot , like a carrot or a potato . " Walter paused here , alarmed by the dark direction the story had taken . This had started as an action-adventure tale to pass the time . He had n't intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it had just sneaked in . Maybe it was too much for kids this young , especially kids in this situation . He walked up the aisle so he could look at them up close , see how they were taking it . He looked into the faces of the regulars : Bucky , thumb in mouth , looked in a trance . Kim sat with her legs hugged into her chest , her chin resting on her knees . Her eyes were bright with interest . Lucy was wrapping a curl around her index finger , impatient for him to go on . Josh , Hector , Heather , Conrad , and Sue Ellen all looked interested and not particularly upset . After all , these were kids who had grown up with The Terminator and Nightmare on Elm Street . These were children who had been held hostage in a buried school bus for weeks . A buzzard fretting about death was unlikely to traumatize them any more than they already were . He went all the way to the back where Brandon Betts lay on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Walter reached out and smoothed down his hair . He climbed up and sat on the back of Philip 's seat so the kids in the front could see him . " Jacksonville felt more alone than he had ever felt in his life . He watched the moon rise . It was almost full , and he was glad to have some light for company because he sure hated sitting alone in the dark . " Then he heard footsteps . He saw this old Tong woman coming toward his cage . She was really old , with a wrinkled face . " She came to his cage and smiled at him . Most of the Tongs have these long pointed teeth , so when they smile it 's scarier than when they do n't . But this woman 's teeth were only a little pointed and they were very white and clean . The wrinkles around her eyes were friendly . " But Jacksonville was nervous . The old woman looked friendly , but  | he 'd learned to be careful . She held her hand out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like she wanted him to come to her . But he did n't , because he was afraid . After all , she was a Barbecue Tong . And we know what they 're like . " Walter paused to drink some water . He noticed Sandra was actually looking at him . He had suspected she followed the story and just pretended to be reading her book . After all , how many times could you reread Stuart Little ? He went on : " The woman reached her hand into the pocket of her baggy white shorts , which was what all female Tongs wear , and she pulled something out . It was shiny , like metal . Then she did something that amazed Jacksonville . She stuck her hand right into the cage , between the bars . She did n't seem afraid that he would hurt her or anything . If he had wanted to , he could have leaned forward and ripped a finger off with his beak , but she did n't seem worried about that . She dropped the shiny thing she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She gave it a little shove toward him and pulled her hand out . Then she looked around again to see if they were still alone . " " I bet it 's a gun , " Bucky said , not removing his thumb from his mouth . " No , " Walter said , " actually it 's not . " " A knife , " Hector said . " Nope . Not a knife either . " " Let him tell it , " Lucy whined . " You 're not supposed to interrupt . Go on , Mr. Demming . " " I know ! " Hector shouted . " A what-do-you-call-it . Galaxy Peace Ray ! " " No , " said Walter , " but would n't that be nice , so you could shoot the whole village into peacefulness . " " Not really , " Hector said , " I 'd rather shoot the bastards with an Uzi or a twelve-gauge shotgun . " He laughed . " Hector , " Lucy said , " you ca n't talk like that . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lucy ? What do you think the thing is ? " Hector challenged . " I do n't know . " She shook her head . " A magic charm or something . " " No , " Walter said , " it 's not a magic charm . And I bet you 're not any of you going to guess what it is . Keep trying . " " A fish , " Heather called out . " Dummy , " Conrad said , " it 's metal . " " No , it was like metal , silvery-colored , " she shouted back . " Dummy yourself , Conrad . " " A hand grenade ? " Conrad said .  | " Nope . " " A pair of scissors , " Josh said . " Nope . " " I know ! I know ! " Kim yelled . " A file , like they use for jail breaks . " " Oh , Kim , that 's close , " Walter said . " You 're getting warm . " " A file ? " Heather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , Mr. Demming , " Lucy urged . " Tell the story . " " Okay . Well , Jacksonville was curious , too , about what the silvery thing was , but he could n't look right away . He was still scared of the old Tong woman . He had to keep his eye on her . She smiled again and ? " He stopped because the lightbulb started to sway on its cord . As it swayed it flickered off and on . All eyes darted to the door . In the pit , black boots appeared , long legs , and with a thud , the whole man . He burst through the bus door , with more energy than Walter had ever seen . He was wired . His body seemed to vibrate with it . His yellow hair looked electric . " Three more days , little Lambs of God ! " He carried no Bible today , but a newspaper . He held it aloft . " Lookee here . The first newspaper we 've seen at Jezreel in forty-seven days . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trade we are working out . We 're going to let your bus driver here talk on the phone tomorrow . The trade is we get to share a little of our message with the world you 'd think they 'd beg for that , would n't you ? But no , they 're scared to hear it . " Walter stood up . He wanted to hear the ground rules for the phone conversation . This time maybe he could do something to improve their situation . " Sit down , Mr. Bus Driver , " Samuel Mordecai commanded . " Later . Later , with all your fussing . I 'm giving the lesson now . " Walter sat . Josh began to wheeze , a series of high , desperate gasps . All the kids looked in his direction . Samuel Mordecai narrowed his eyes as the wheezing alternated with coughing . " Get it under control , sonny boy . We have n't any time for this . I thought we 'd do our lesson today out of the newspaper because , Lambs , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all present in this one edition . Look at this : war in Bosnia , war in Haiti , war in Kuwait , war in Rwanda , earthquakes in China and California , AIDS in Mexico and Africa , the European Community , a global economy controlled by computer , the T.yilateral Commission , strange sightings in the heavens , debit cards , electronic transfers , movements of troops in the Middle East . Oh , Lambs , nothing is missing , nothing but us . And we will be ready in three days . " Josh let out a series of choking coughs . Mordecai talked over them .  | " And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars . For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes , in divers places . ' Matthew 24:6-7 . It 's all here . Lambs , this prophecy for what the world will be like at the end times could be the little summary of the news they do on this very front page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's all accomplished , just waiting for us to play our parts . Rejoice . We are the chosen human agents to ? " Josh let out some deep , desperate gasps for air . Walter got up and went to him . Samuel Mordecai gestured for him to sit down , but he pretended not to see it . He bent down over the boy . " Water , Josh ? " " No  --  ca n't ? " Josh bent forward abruptly and put his hands on his knees . He threw his head back and gulped for air . Walter picked the inhaler up from the seat . He held it up to Josh 's mouth . " Use your inhaler , honey . It helps . " Josh took it and squeezed . Walter had grown to love the poof sound it made because he associated it with relief . Josh handed it back to Walter and began to draw some ragged breaths . Samuel Mordecai took a few steps down the aisle to look closer at Josh . With each step he took , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and said , " We 'll do the lesson later . Give sonny here a chance to get himself together . " Brandon Betts stood up . " Wait , Prophet Mordecai ! " He ran to the front of the bus and grabbed Mordecai 's hand . " I want to come with you . I do n't belong with them . I believe you , and they do n't . They are n't listening like I am . " " I believe you , too . " Sue Ellen stood up . " Now , now , " Mordecai said , slapping the rolled-up paper against his leg in a nervous flurry . " We 'll all be together in the millennium . But you need to stay here until Friday at sundown . Then you 'll ' have your fifty days . Fifty days for the earth to purify you . " He swept his hand toward the black windows . " See the earth all around you . It is rebirthing you . Ca n't you feel it happening ? It makes you worthy to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's where our name comes from . Hearth Jezreelites . See hearth is earth with an H , which stands for heaven , heaven in earth . And Jezreelites because Jesus trod the valley of Jezreel and I am His , His son , His prophet , His descendant . " He disengaged Brandon 's hand from his arm . " You 'll come with me on Friday . " He pulled the X-acto knife out of his hip pocket and leaned over to the window . With a flick of the wrist , he scraped off a Band-Aid . There were three left now .  | Josh 's breathing had quieted , but Lucy and Bucky had begun to sob . Brandon was pleading and praying . Samuel Mordecai backed out the door . " Tend to this , Mr. Bus Driver . " Seeing him leaving , Walter was stabbed with panic . With Josh 's inhaler in his hand , he bolted up the aisle . " Wait ! Mordecai . You see how Josh is . This is nothing . He gets much worse attacks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an albuterol inhaler , like this one . " He thrust it up in front of Mordecai 's face . " And maybe a steroid one for emergencies . That 's all . When I talk to the negotiators , I want to ask them . I know they 'll want to send one in , leave one at the gate maybe . If I ask for it , it wo n't be like you 'll have to give up anything for it . Please let me . When can I talk to them ? " Samuel Mordecai turned around and pushed his wild curls back off his forehead . " There will be no asking for anything , Mr. Bus Driver , but here 's something  --  the Lambs can send messages to their parents  --  one sentence per Lamb . Tomorrow . We 'll come get you . " " Can I send a message , too ? " Mordecai laughed . " You 'll have a minute . If you can fit it in , send a message . " He turned , but Walter grabbed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He opened his mouth to make another plea , too , but Samuel Mordecai reached out and took the inhaler from him . Then he stepped out the door and pulled himself up and out  --  quickly-a fast escape . Walter stood stunned . He had taken the inhaler . Did that mean he was going to get it refilled ? Or was he confiscating it ? The one thing that actually seemed to give relief ? Walter turned back to face the chaos of the bus : Several kids were crying ; Brandon and Hector were screaming at one another . Josh was gasping . Bucky was curled up into a ball , his hands pressed over his ears . Walter stood at the front of the bus , trying to regulate his breathing . He did n't know where to start , what to do , how to calm all this down . It was chaos , total breakdown . Then Hector gave Brandon a shove that sent him reeling against one of the seats . Brandon started to scream . " Hector , please come here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final twist and stalked up the aisle . " What ? " he said , looking up into Walter 's face . " This . If Brandon believes what Mordecai is saying , that 's his right . Religious freedom . " " He 's like a . . . " He searched for the word . " Traitor . " " No . We 're all under lots of pressure . Do n't give Brandon a hard time . He 's doing what he feels he has to do . " Hector lowered his voice . " I 'm afraid he 'll tell about our emergency  | plan , our rehearsals . We ca n't let Brandon or Sue Ellen tell him about it . Do n't that worry you , man ? " " Yes . It worries me a lot . But I think Brandon 's really torn apart . He 's afraid Mordecai might be right . " " Mordecai 's a bag of hot air . Here 's what I want to do . " Hector put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest , his back to the rest of the bus , so only Walter could see it . He opened the largest blade and whispered , " I 'm sick of this shit . Why do n't I stick him . Before he kills us , man . That 's what he 's going to do , ai n't it ? " " Shhh . " Walter put a finger to his mouth . " Do n't scare the other kids . I do n't know . " He looked at the knife with keen interest . He took it from Hector and examined the blade . He ran his thumb against the cutting edge and moved the blade back and forth to see how strong it was . Then he closed it carefully and slipped it into his own pocket . " Hey , man , " Hector hissed . " It 's mine . It 's all I got . " " I know . But , Hector , I need to have it for the emergency plan . I 've used a knife before , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . It 's best for me to have it . If there 's any stabbing to do , I will do it . How did you manage to hold on to it through the search ? " Hector leaned over to study the three Band-Aids . " In my Jockeys , man , and it hurt like hell . " He touched one of the Band-Aids . " Three more days . Why have n't they tried to rescue us ? When you talked to that FBI guy the second day he said he 'd get us out , right ? " Walter nodded . Hector 's huge black eyes filled with tears . " Well , why do n't they , man ? Do n't they know he 's gon na kill us ? " It was a subject Walter had thought about endlessly . Now he squatted down , and motioned for Hector to do the same so they could talk in some privacy . Walter told the boy , " He also said our safety was the most important thing . I think they want to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . Remember when we drove here , how big the property is , and there are lots of different buildings . I think for a rescue they need to know where we are . And from all I can figure , I suppose Mordecai threatened to kill us if they come in . " He studied the boy . At twelve , Hector Ramirez was the most mature of the boys , and the savviest . The oldest of a family of seven , he 'd had responsibilities beyond his years . His voice was already deepening and a wispy growth darkened his upper lip . Walter had found him to be quickwitted and dependable . It was probably inexcusable to burden a child with this , but he needed someone to talk to and Hector seemed like a good bet , a sturdy kid . " They probably worry that if they attack , we 'll get  | hit in the cross fire . Or that it would take so long to find us after an attack starts that ? " Hector finished it for him : " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm trying to think of a way to let them know where we are . " " When you talk to them tomorrow ? " " Uh-huh . Maybe try to give them some message that the Hearth Jezreelite guys would n't know was a message , but was . " Hector 's dark eyes gleamed . " Like some secret code or something . " " Yeah , exactly . I 'm working on some ideas . Hector , are you willing to let me use your message to your parents as a way to send a message ? " Hector thought for a minute . " Sure thing , man . How would you do it ? " " I 'm not sure . But what would your parents do if they got a message from you that made no sense to them ? " Hector grinned . " My dad is not . . . well , not fast to see things that are new . But my mom , she 's something else . She 'd know right away what we were trying to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what I want to do now is get ready for what 's going to happen . I need you to help . I want to practice our drills so that when it comes , we can all do our parts really fast . " " Yeah , " Hector said , " I think we can do better than old Jacksonville is doing . What a dim bulb the guy is . " " Oh , I do n't know , " Walter said . " He may come out of it okay . Slow and steady wins the race . " Hector snorted . " Slow and steady ! That do n't win nothing . Do n't you go to the movies , man ? " He smiled his big flashing smile . " Fast and mean wins the race . That 's how we got ta play it  --  fast and mean . "  | Seeing Grady 's ancient green Mazda parked in her driveway made her pulse quicken . Molly had n't seen him for five days , and she 'd missed him ? lots . Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just pulled her truck in next to his Mazda . As she got out , she heard whimpers coming from the fenced yard at the side of her town house . She walked around toward the gate . Grady 's low voice floated out to her . " That 's right , Copper . Good boy . " " What 's he doing to be a good boy , " she called over the high wood fence , " peeing on my grass ? " The gate opened for her . Grady Traynor , dressed in a gray suit that looked as if it had been slept in for several lifetimes , stood there smiling at her . His white hair and mustache looked limp and slightly greasy . The circles under his eyes had darkened alarmingly and his tan was fading fast . After forty-seven days , the standoff at Jezreel was taking a toll on him that twenty-eight years of police work , eight of it in homicide , had somehow failed to do . He opened his arms wide and Molly stepped toward him , her heart quickening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growl made Molly step back hastily . An enormous black dog snarled up at her , his lips drawn back to show large yellowed fangs . The coarse hair on his neck bristled and his legs were spread aggressively . His amber eyes were slits of mal-ice.  | " Goddammit , Grady . That scares me . " The dog had repelled her from the start , when Grady had brought him by for the first time three months ago . He was a Belgian Malinois , Grady had informed her , though to Molly 's eye he looked exactly like a German shepherd . It was an ancient working breed , Grady explained like a proud parent , bred in Europe to herd sheep and kill predators , now used almost exclusively for police and guard work . This specimen was mostly black , but with a dusting of reddish tan on his muzzle , neck , and front legs . His long narrow muzzle had a downward bend in it about midway between the eye and the nose , and the ear on his left side had a ragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I keep forgetting that he sees close contact as something he 's supposed to do something about . He does n't mean anything personal by it . " He squatted down to pat the dog . " Okay , Copper . It 's all right , sweetie . " He rubbed his black head and chest vigorously . The dog quieted down . " See . He 's a real pussycat . If you 'd get to know him , you 'd ? " " Grady , do n't start that . " " Okay . But if you 'd just keep him here for a few days , you 'd see that he 's ? " " No . Not for a few days . Not even a few minutes . I do n't want a dog . And if I did , this dog would definitely not be the one I wanted . I think he 's dangerous , a time bomb . He shows too much tooth for my taste . " " This disappoints me , Molly . I would think you 'd see the challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life . The answer was no two months ago , and it 's still no . This is your reclamation project , Grady . I predict you 'll regret it . When this animal bites someone and you get sued . " " But look at him , " Grady said , still scratching the dog 's chest . The dog had his eyes closed in ecstasy and his left rear leg was thumping reflexively . " Well , you certainly have the touch . " She laughed , thinking how much she 'd like to get Grady upstairs in bed for a few hours . " That 's one thing Copper and I agree on . When do you have to be back at Jezreel ? " " Tomorrow , six A.M. We 're still doing twelve hours on and twelve off . " She walked over to one of the rickety lawn chairs on the little brick terrace and sat down . " Killer schedule . After six weeks of it , it 's amazing you 're still standing . How 's it going ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not going anywhere . It 's a bust . "  | " Tell me . " " There 's nothing to tell . Forty-seven days , Molly  --  a month and a half  --  the best negotiators in the country working round the clock , and we have gotten fucking nowhere . Andrew Stein 's the guy who wrote the book on the subject . He 's got thirty years ' experience in talking perps out of doing insane things to hostages . He talked the Iraqi bombers out of the synagogue in Chicago ; he negotiated fifty hostages out of that Colorado survivalist commune without a drop of blood getting shed . From Samuel Mordecai he ca n't get one kid on the telephone for ten seconds . You know what we 've accomplished in forty-seven days ? We got one minute with the driver on the second day . And this morning  --  big break-through  --  we got him to agree to let us speak to the driver again . Tomorrow , he says . For that , we give him ten minutes on KLTX radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some newspapers . We also stuck some inhalers in the bag with the papers in the hope that once they 're inside , he 'll give them to Josh Benderson . " " Did you put listening devices in the inhalers ? " " Oh , God , Molly . We debated it all night , but if Mordecai found them , it would kill all chance of getting medication to the kid . So we did n't . " He ran his hands through his hair . " That kid is seriously sick . Assuming he 's still alive . For all we know , they 've all been dead from day one . " He said it fiercely . " I do n't think they 're dead , " Molly said . Grady sighed . " Me either . Not yet . " " Have you figured out what he wants ? " " Sure . He wants an hour on network television . That 's what he 's really after , Molly  --  a worldwide satellite TV broadcast before Friday night . He wants to preach to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will . Gladly . But he needs to give something in return . " " All eleven kids and the bus driver ? " " That 's what we say . And they 'd have to come out first . " He leaned over closer to her and whispered , " Just between us , we 'd settle for six kids . " " What does he say to it ? " " He does n't answer . He rants . He says we  --  the negotiators  --  are part of the military-industrial , computer-corrupted group of world leaders he 's marked to be made into blood statues . Did n't he once threaten you with that ? " " Yes . When my cult piece came out . " " So you may be wondering what blood statues are . " He raised his  | eyebrows at her , always a dramatic gesture since they were jet black and met in the middle . " No . But I can see you 're going to tell me . " " I think it 's important for you to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted on his message , Mordecai has marked our souls with bar codes that emit a blue glow that can only be perceived by angels . We are not talking about just any angels here , but a team of military attack angels led by the Archangel Gabriel . When the trumpets blow on Friday , they will swoop to earth and cut our throats with heat-sealing laser knives . Then they will hang us upside down in such a way that with our arms and legs outstretched we will resemble pentagrams . And we will remain blood statues , rotting and stinking through all eternity . " Grady watched her for a reaction . " Does he ? " The words stuck in Molly 's throat . " Does he talk about the kids and the bus driver as being part of that corrupted group of world leaders ? " " No . He refers to them as Lambs . Damn , Molly , I 'm so damned sick of his sermonizing . One of the things you count on in long hostage negotiations is the perps getting tired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , are zombies . Listen to this : He says we 're the captives , not him . He says we 're caught between Gabriel 's attack angels and his legions of cult members on the outside , what Mordecai calls his Sword Hand of God . " " Is there truth to that ? " Molly asked . " Legions of cult members on the outside ? " " Not legions , but there are some and they are damned effective . It 's been hard to get much intelligence . The ones we can locate who have left are terrified of talking about it . " " Are you thinking of letting some parents talk to him ? " " Mrs. Bassett . Actually , he 's requested her . Saw her on television , Channel 33 news . He says he 'd like to talk to her . We 'll probably give it a try . She 's a real persuasive lady , and we do n't see how it could hurt . He also says he might let her come in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . An ironclad FBI rule  --  no one enters a hostage situation , ever , for no reason , period . But we are out of ideas , Molly , running on empty . He 's just been stringing us along , buying time . I do n't think he ever had the slightest intention of letting any of those kids go . I think he 's got other plans for them . " " Oh , Grady . " " This leaves the door open for the HRT tactical nuts , the knucklewalkers , to take over . They 're sitting in a warehouse three miles away in  | their Ninja suits cleaning their assault rifles . They 've had an emergency assault plan ready from day two . They 're on fifteen-minute call-up and they are dieseling . " Molly had been fearing it might come to that . She groaned . " Yeah , " he continued , " giving up on negotiations probably condemns those kids to death . Eighty-six percent of the hostages who die get killed during an assault . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Mordecai has convinced us  --  he will kill them all the second he thinks an attack is starting . Anyway , how can we attack when we still do n't know where in the compound they 're being held ? " He closed his eyes . " But we have no choice anymore . And we 're going to lose them . Oh , Molly , it 's impossible . " He let his head fall back on the chair . " I 'm crisped . " She 'd never before heard Grady say anything was impossible . She reached out to take his hand , but the dog , lying at his feet now , looked up and growled low in his throat . Molly drew her hand back . She was quiet for a minute . She had been trying to decide whether to tell him about Dorothy Huff and Samuel Mordecai 's adoption . It was a dilemma : Grady was a wonderful sounding board , the best person she knew to brainstorm with . And if there was a prayer of tracking down Mordecai 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , Grady was a cop , first and foremost . If she told him , he 'd feel he had to pass it on to his boss or to the FBI . Grady said , " Well , are you going to tell me or are n't you ? " Molly turned her head . He had n't opened his eyes . " What ? " " Whatever it is you 're agonizing over . " " If I tell you , will you promise to let me decide how to use the information ? " His eyes were open now , studying her face . " Not if it 's something to do with this mess in Jezreel . Not if I think it 's police business . " " Then I ca n't tell you . I have a feeling about this . " " Molly , do n't do this . You need to tell me . " " I 'm afraid the authorities will muck this up , that they wo n't use it right . " " Molly , my sweet , I am one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being I know . What makes you so sure you are better qualified to deal with whatever it is than , say , the FBI 's chief negotiator , or a thirty-year police veteran like myself ? " " You 're not in charge there . " " True . But they 're not bad , these FBI agents . They want to negotiate the kids out and they have more experience doing that sort of thing than  | anyone else in the country . Some of them are assholes , but , hey , so 's Samuel Mordecai . " She thought about it . " One thing I know , Grady : If I do n't tell anyone , there ca n't be any leaks to the press . " " You are the press , " he pointed out . " No . Not in this case I 'm not . This is nothing I want to write about . This information may have a much higher use . " Grady was quiet , clearly weighing it . Then he put a hand over his heart and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chair . " Did you know that Samuel Mordecai was adopted as a baby ? " The black eyebrows went up in surprise . " Evelyn Grimes was not his mother ? " " She adopted him when he was an infant . " " Says who ? " " Says his grandmother , Dorothy Huff . " He sat back in his chair . " Tell me everything . " Molly knew that when he said everything , he meant absolutely everything , with no detail omitted . So , while the dog lay panting at their feet , she told him about Samuel Mordecai 's being found floating in a beer cooler in Waller Creek and about the adoption . Grady listened the way he always did , actively , and with total concentration , nodding and grunting and raising his eyebrows in astonishment . " I have the robe and the adoption papers in my truck , " she finished . " Oh , here 's something else you may not know : Gramma Huff says that Annette Grimes , Mordecai 's wife , is not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding . " " Really ? She 's on our list of the hundred and twenty people we think are inside . " He stroked his long white mustache with his index finger . " That is mighty interesting . I would love to talk with Mrs. Grimes . Do you think Granny has any idea where she is ? " " No . I 'm sure she does n't . Annette wrote Dorothy Huff to say goodbye and that she 'd never be able to contact her again . Apparently she 's terrified for her life . " " I bet . Molly , that 's important . I have to pass it on to Lattimore and Stein . We 'll find her . " " Grady , here 's what I 've been thinking about the adoption issue . Mordecai seems desperate to know who his birth mother is . He 's tried to find her and failed . It 's real important to him . What if we could find his mother for him ? " She watched his face to see if he was responding the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , it could be a major bargaining chip to use with him . We 'd reveal her identity , maybe let him talk to her  | on the phone if he 'd release some kids . I have n't thought it through , but before you resort to force , this might work . " " Maybe . If we can find her . Does n't sound like there 's much to go on. , , " I think I know how we could start , or how you could . " She waited to see how long it would take him to figure out what she had in mind . It took two seconds . " Oh , Molly . Do you know how difficult that would be ? We were n't computerized in ' 62 . All those incident reports are boxed up in a warehouse in South Austin . And to find it with no one knowing what we 're looking for means I 'd have to do the looking myself . Now , when I have no time as it is . " She gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . Or tonight . " " Molly , " he wailed , " I have n't slept in forty-eight hours . And I have n't spent any time with my dog . " Molly glanced down at the dog . Copper-field 's eyes narrowed into demonic slits . She looked back at Grady , who was grinning now . He said , " I suppose I could look for that report , if it were n't for Copper . He 's going through a hard transition , Molly . He needs attention , and a stable home environment . The love of a good woman and a safe fenced yard . " He leaned back in his chair and waited . With a sinking heart , Molly looked down at the drooling muzzle and the mean amber eyes . " Oh , Christ , " she said . " Not that . Anything but that . " " Everything has its price , Molly . " Grady reached his arm around her shoulders , but when the dog began to growl he quickly withdrew it . " Take it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog out in the yard , but he barked nonstop . Then they let him in the house but closed him out of the bedroom . That did n't work because he howled and scratched on the door . So they let him in , which left them with the problem of how to touch one another without getting mauled . They solved it by pulling the covers up over their heads so he would n't see them . It seemd to work . " This is ridiculous , " Molly murmured , running her hands down Grady 's bare back . " Worse than worrying the kids will walk in on you . " " He 'll get used to it , Molly . Give him a little time . Actually , it may be better like this , makes it feel more illicit . Reminds me of being a kid and reading under the covers with a flashlight . Best reading I ever did . " Molly let her fingers wander all the way down the dip in his lower  | back and over his buttocks , still gloriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading under the covers , Lieutenant ? " " Detective magazines . Comic books . Innocent stuff . " " Detective magazines are n't so innocent . Ninety percent of all serial killers read them . " " So I guess when you grow up on them , you become either a serial killer or a cop . " " See , not innocent at all . " She moved her hips slowly against his until he moaned . Later on , she was sitting on his back massaging his shoulders . " Yes , " he said , " that knot right there . Molly , my lease is up at the end of the month . " Her hands stopped kneading . " I thought you had another year to go . " " Well , I did , but some of the residents have been complaining , so the landlord terminated it . " " Because of the dog ? " " They 're so fussy . He growled once or twice in the elevator . " " Objecting to being growled at in your own elevator does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I never really liked it there . And it 's not a good place for a dog . No yard . " She climbed off him and stretched out next to him . " I 'll have to move , " he said . She closed her eyes . " Molly , are you there or have you gone to sleep on me ? " " I 'm here , Grady . " " If I moved in with you " ? he rested the back of his hand on her stomach and slowly inched it downward ? " we could read under the covers all the time . " Molly was feeling her body temperature rise , but with anxiety , not passion . She leaned over and kissed him long and warm on the lips . When they both came up for breath , she said , " I love you desperately and forever . But , Grady , I 'm not cut out for domestic life . I 'm a slow learner , but I do learn eventually , after three failed attempts . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is domestic life . Right here , in bed , talking , making love . Molly , you know I do n't expect you to be a wife . I just want to be close to you , see you every day , sleep next to you . So we can do this in the middle of the day , like this . I do n't want you to change your life in any way . " " What 's the matter with things as they are right now ? " she de-  | manded . " I love things this way . And we can do anything we want in the middle of the day now . Anyway , we tried it once and it did n't work . " " Molly , that was twenty-four years ago . We 're different people now . " " I know , but ? " The phone rang . Relieved , Molly threw off the blanket and reached for it . " Yes . " " Molly Cates ? " " Yes . " " Patrick Lattimore , Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grady is right here . " She put her hand over the mouthpiece and said , " Under a blanket hiding from his dog . " " No , it 's you I want to talk with , " said the voice on the phone . " Miss Cates , do you know a Gerald Asquith ? " Molly sat up . " No , not really . I have n't met him . Just over the phone . We 've talked . " " You had an appointment with him tonight ? " Grady sat up and gestured to her to let him listen , too . She tilted the phone and he put his cheek next to hers . " Yes , " Molly said , " at seven . " " Well , he 's not going to keep it . He 's dead . " Molly 's breath caught in her throat . " How ? " " He was found by a dog-walker at Pease Park , tied upside down to a tree branch , naked . Throat cut . " " A blood statue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How did you know I had an appointment with him ? " " Asquith 's clothes were folded neatly nearby and in his pocket was his Day-Timer with your name and number . We had an appointment with him this afternoon . When did you talk to him ? " " Last night . . . around nine , I think . How would the Sword Hand of God have known about him ? " " I wondered about that , too , until I heard that Asquith did a radio show last night , one of the religious stations , and preached about the ungodly heresy of Donnie Ray Grimes . " Mordecai hated being called by his old name . " So they heard it ? " " Yeah . And Mordecai might have , too , but we 're certain he ca n't communicate with anyone but us . I am most distressed by this , Miss Cates . It means the Hearth Jezreelites are actively at work outside , looking for victims . How did you learn about Asquith ? " " A friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past  | disagreements with Samuel Mordecai . She told me about him . She 's the one who persuaded him to call you . " " I see . Could you give me Mrs. Dodgin 's number , please ? " " Yes . I 'll have to find my book . I 'll give you to Grady while I look . Here . " She handed the phone to Grady . She found her address book in the kitchen and got on the extension . She gave him the number . " I 'm worried about her , " Molly said . " We 'll check on her , " Lattimore promised . When she got back to the bedroom , Grady was sitting up against the headboard looking worried . Molly sat next to him and slid an arm around him . From the floor came a snarling . The dog was on his feet , poised for attack . Slowly Molly withdrew her arm . " God , I could n't live with that , Grady . " Grady was n't paying any attention . He was staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poison . This means anyone involved in giving information to the feds is in danger . Molly , you need to be careful . " " I am always careful , " she said . He turned a skeptical look on her . " And now I 've got a chaperone . " She looked down at the dog , who had settled himself next to the bed , but was watching with vigilant eyes . " So you can go out and find that police report from August 3 , 1962 . " " We need to talk about my lease , " Grady said . " Sure , we can talk . But let 's wait until this Jezreel thing is over . " " Why ? " " Let 's say I can only consider one cataclysmic event at a time . "  | The dog was sleeping on the floor outside her bedroom door . Stretched out , he was so long he blocked the entire doorway . A little pool of saliva had collected on the wood floor under his long muzzle . " Move , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she prodded his back with a bare foot . He exploded to his feet with such force she jumped back instinctively . To cover her fear , she used her most authoritarian voice . " Copperfield , you are going out in the yard . Now . " She had grown up with dogs on her daddy 's ranch and had liked them well enough , but this highstrung , volatile creature was nothing like those good-natured hounds . Why on earth had she agreed to this ? The dog looked up at Molly , trembling . She walked across the living room to the sliding-glass door and pulled it open . She stood aside and said , " Out you go . " The dog just stood where he was . " I said out , " she said louder . He lowered his head and his tail . " Dammit . Copper , come . " Very slowly the dog started toward her , one paw in front of the other , as if he were trudging through quicksand . He walked with his big head hanging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of his choke collar and pulled him outside . As she slid the door shut , he turned and stared up at her through the glass . Before she reached the bedroom door again , he started barking . His barks were sharp and insistent . She whirled around . " No ! " she called across the room . In answer , the dog gave one loud , abrupt bark that seemed to echo her word . " No , " she shouted again . Again he barked his  | imitation . She turned and stomped back to the bedroom to find her shoes . Even from inside her closet the barking was deafening ; it was continuous now , and intensifying . Damnation . If he went on like that , it would drive her neighbors crazy . She slid her feet into her shoes and stalked back to the door . The dog had made a large cloudy smudge on the glass . The barking was incredibly loud and annoying . She certainly could n't leave him outside to do that . Her neighbors in this sedate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't leave him inside either . Grady had said when left alone he tended to go on a chewing rampage . Damn . She looked at her watch . Ten to four . She was due to pick up Jake Alesky at four , and she did n't want to keep him waiting . She looked at the dog hard , trying to stare him down . But he kept up his barking , never even drawing a breath . Molly opened the door and the dog surged in . Tongue lolling , he ran around Molly in circles . " What am I going to do with you ? " she said . The dog ran to the front door and sat staring at the door . " Well , " she said , " maybe we 'll try it . But do n't make me sorry . " She picked up his worn leather leash off the kitchen counter and slung her bag over her shoulder . " We 're going out to the country , Copper . Maybe you 'll run off and get lost , go feral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailgate on her pickup . Without being told to , the dog leapt up into the truck bed . He looked excited , she thought , happy even , holding his tail higher than she 'd ever seen it . " Okay , " she told him grudgingly . " But remember , buddy , this is an experiment . I 'm watching you . " As she drove south on MoPac she checked the rearview mirror to see what he was doing . He stood with his head raised into the wind and his eyes closed . When she pulled into Piney Haven , three small children were playing behind the office . She watched the dog apprehensively . He could easily leap out and attack them , but he showed no signs of doing that . She drove back to Jake 's trailer . He was sitting in his wheelchair under the green awning . He wore a clean white short-sleeved shirt , ironed and crisp , and aviator sunglasses . Molly got out of the truck , eyeing the dog uneasily . " Sorry about the dog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend and I could n't leave him at home , so ... " Jake wheeled himself to the back of the truck and looked the dog over . " What happened to you , fellow ? " he asked in a low voice . " Oh , the ear ? He 's retired from the APD canine unit , " Molly said . " He got beat up pretty bad , bludgeoned , actually , with a tire iron . He 's a little psycho. "  | Jake kept studying the dog . " Well , who would n't be after that ? " he said more to the dog than to Molly . He wheeled closer and held a hand up toward Copperfield . " Hey , fellow . " The dog leaned over the side and sniffed his hand . " What 's his name ? " " Copper . Short for Copperfield . " " Hey , Copper . What a good old boy you are . " The dog stretched his head down and Jake scratched behind the one good ear . " Are you ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog a final pat . " All set . " He rolled to the passenger door . " If you 'll help with the chair , I can get myself in . A truck 's a little harder because it 's high , but the running board 's a big help . " He reached up and opened the door , wheeling backward to let it swing open . Molly came around , feeling awkward and uncertain about how to help . He maneuvered his chair right up to the side and said , " You just hold tight to the chair so it does n't move . And stand right there so I can brace myself against you if I need to . " He gripped the arms of the wheelchair and pushed himself up so he was balanced on his stumps . " Okay , now hold tight . " The veins in his arms stood out with the effort of shifting himself to the running board . Then , with one hand on the seat and another on the running board he boosted himself up , off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more difficult to do than he let on . Molly wondered how you built the upper-body strength to do that . " Wow , " she said , once he was settled in the passenger seat , " I do n't think I could do that if my life depended on it . " He looked down at her . " Sure you could . Being in a wheelchair makes you really strong through the arms and shoulders . Even if you do n't work out , and I do . " He gestured at the chair . " To fold it , just squeeze the arms together . Yeah , like that . Now you can set it in the back . " Molly folded the chair , got a tarp from the back seat , spread it out in the bed , and then with difficulty hoisted the chair into the back . By the time she climbed behind the wheel she 'd worked up a sheen of sweat . She turned toward him . He was buckling the seat belt . " What 's the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yeah . We 'll take the 79 West exit toward ' Taylor . " They drove in silence until Molly got them through the downtown traffic . Once they were headed north on I-35 , Jake said , " Tell me about the dog  --  how he lost his ear . " " The dog . Well , he was in the canine unit for eight years , with the same handler . " Grady had told her the story  --  several times . " One Saturday night he and his handler were searching a field in East Austin , looking for a suspect in a 7-Eleven robbery . Copper tracked the suspect and  | two of his friends to a shed where they were hiding . The three suspects heat the handler to a pulp with tire irons and tried to do the same to Copper , but he managed to give as good as he got . One of the perps nearly lost an arm and the other two required numerous stitches . Copper lost half an ear . " When the rest of the cops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Copper went berserk and would n't let the cops or EMS get anywhere near his handler . They had their guns drawn to shoot him when one of the EMTs found a tarp . So they netted him . The handler died that night , and Copper was retired with honors . But APD policy dictates that police dogs can retire only with police families and no one in the department would take him home . No one but my friend Grady Raynor , who has never much liked dogs . " She sighed . " Grady 's been out at Jezreel , he 's one of the negotiators . So he coerced me into taking the beast on for a few days . That 's why he 's in the back of my truck . " Jake turned his head to look at Copper in the back . " Is that such a problem ? " " Not if you remember never to touch anyone in his presence . When you hug someone he panics . He thinks violence is being done and considers it his responsibility to intervene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It would be if I had one . " " PTSD , " Jake said . " Huh ? " " Post-traumatic stress disorder . Sounds like that 's what he has . Like Vietnam vets . " It seemed like an ideal segue . " You promised to tell me about Walter Demming 's vows , " Molly reminded him . " Did I ? Well , I might make good on that , but I can see you 're someone who always turns the conversation away from yourself . I want to hear some personal contribution from you first . Tell me what you did this morning . " She laughed . " Okay . I went to talk to Samuel Mordecai 's grandmother , the woman who raised him . " " What 's she like ? " Molly did n't answer right away . Finally she said , " When I was about seven , I saw a play of Hansel and Gretel at the local high school . The witch was so cold and evil that I had nightmares for a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God , " Jake said . " Ca n't we have any villains anymore ? It seems like everybody got abused as a child . I suppose this means I ca n't hate Samuel Mordecai anymore . "  | " You can still hate him , " she replied . " I do . But I caught a glimpse of why he 's what he is . Now tell me about Walter 's vows . " " Okay . You have to understand these were post-Vietnam vows . Made while he was spending time with me in the Veterans hospital . You ca n't imagine how angry we were . " He shook his head . " No one can imagine . " " Who were you mad at ? " " Oh , our lieutenant , who was an idiot . The army , which flicked everything up . The gooks , who were braver and tougher than we were . My father , who raised me on stories of his World War II exploits , the draft board in Milwaukee that delivered me up , the American people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village of Trang Loi , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Lyndon Johnson , Smokey the Bear , George Washington . If I 'd known you then , I would have been mad at you . We were just fucking furious at everything . " Molly glanced over at him . " You 're right  --  I ca n't imagine . " " Yeah . Well , Walter made four vows . I told you that obscurity was one of them . The idea was never to do anything or make enough money to get noticed by the government . " " Is that why a man who went to Rice drove a school bus ? " " In part . It also allowed him time to do his real work . " " Which is ? " " You 'll see when we get there . " Molly said , " The second vow was noninvolvement ? " " Yeah . No girlfriends could stay over more than one night in a row , no kids , no commitments . The third vow was never again to wear a uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me it 's panty hose . What about the fourth vow ? " " Oh , that one he 's broken . " " What was it ? " " Never again to look into the barrel of a gun . It must have been an awful moment for him , like a flashback , to have been surrounded like that . " " That happened to him in Vietnam ? " Jake stared straight ahead . " No comment . " When they left the Interstate , Molly said , " We 're going to go past the turnoff to Jezreel . It 's right up here on the left . " " Yeah , I know . Two miles to hell . " As they passed , they looked up the rural road marked 128 . Molly had been down that road once , two years before , when she went to interview Samuel Mordecai at Jezreel . Her memory and the nonstop press cover-  | age had since etched into her mind the compound 's distinctive profile . She could draw it in her sleep  --  the boxlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two high , round stone towers with crenellated tops and narrow slitlike gunports . Like some cheap Texas version of a medieval castle . She knew if they turned up that road , they 'd see the media city , tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles , and a bunch of fully armed federal agents and DPS troopers at the checkpoint they 'd staked out weeks ago . " Have you been out there ? " Jake asked . " Not since I interviewed Samuel Mordecai two years ago . " " How come ? Seems if you 're doing a story on it , you 'd want to go out and see it again . " " I see it on the TV news all the time , more than I want to . " " It 's not the same thing as seeing it for yourself . " " Sounds like you 'd like to go . " " Maybe so . To see what it 's like . Yeah . If you decide to go , can I ride along ? " " Do n't hold your breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ramshackle house with stained green siding and warped window frames . A trumpet vine laden with vivid orange blooms grew exuberantly up the side and over the roof . Behind the house stretched a field of wildflowers  --  the usual bluebonnets and Indian paintbrushes , but in the center was the densest stand of white Texas prickly poppies she 'd ever seen  --  huge fluttery white flowers on tall stalks . " This is beautiful , " Molly breathed . Jake was unbuckling his seat belt . " Yeah . I like it out here . " He pointed to a stone barbecue on the terrace in front of the house . " Walter and me built that , out of rock we collected right around here . " Molly studied the fine rockwork and the natural way the grill seemed to grow right out of the stone terrace . He pointed to a large white frame house just visible across the field . " That 's Theodora Shea 's house , Walter 's real love . She does the best chocolate cake in the hemisphere . " Molly got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started sniffing around just like a normal dog would do on an outing to the country . She hauled Jake 's wheelchair out and set it up , following his directions . Then she held it steady while he maneuvered himself into it . After he 'd caught his breath , he wheeled himself toward the house .  | Molly had n't noticed the wheelchair ramp to the side of the steps until they approached the door . Jake propelled himself up it . " Walter and I did this ramp , too . " He pulled a key out of his pocket , unlocked the door , and spun to the side to let Molly precede him . The house was one big sunny room with a bed in one corner and a kitchen in another . The rest of the room was given over to an artist 's studio . A long wooden picnic table in the center of the room was covered with cans of brushes , bottles , paints , and colored pencils  --  all neatly organized . On two of the walls and on three easels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completion . All were of birds , most of them brightly colored tropical birds . " Lately he 's been doing birds , " Jake said . " In pencil . " Molly stood in the middle of the room for a minute to get the feel of Walter Demming 's life . She loved to see the places where people did their work and often asked other writers to show her their offices because that seemed to be more revealing of the soul than the houses they lived in . And sometimes it seemed that just being in the workspace of someone whose work you admired might actually magically transfer to you some of their creative energy . Crazy , no doubt , but she was feeling it now as she surveyed Walter Demming 's drawings . She started to wander the room looking at pictures . The birds were all portrayed very close-up and from odd angles . These were not the usual static bird sketches , where you had a complete bird , centered on the paper , neatly grasping a twig and giving the artist its best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if you were glimpsing it flying through a frame . They were done on white textured paper with brightcolored pencils . The feathers were rendered in a distinctive cross-hatching of colors . She 'd never thought of birds as individuals before , but each of these birds had about its face and feathers the mark of idiosyncrasy ; each was a bird you would be able to recognize if you saw it again . The faces were rendered in precise detail , as if the artist knew each of them intimately . Walter Demming definitely had a style and , judging from the number of works he had going here , he was wildly productive . The feel she got was of a man who let the energy of nature swirl through him and flow out his fingertips . How would a man like that endure captivity ? she wondered . Where would all that energy go ? She stopped in front of one of the easels . Arranged diagonally on the paper was the almost finished portrait of a turkey vulture . The bird was shown in profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing and breast were rendered in a cross-hatching of brown , black , yellow , and  | red that shone like a dark mahogany . The naked red neck and head had isolated black hairs , prickly and assertive , growing out of them ; the hooked beak seemed huge and translucent . She was shocked to recognize the bird as Jake Alesky . Why had n't she noticed when she 'd first met him that he looked like a turkey vulture ? She would never have thought of it , but now that she 'd seen the resemblance , she doubted that she could ever get it out of her head . She stole a glance at him sitting across the room . Did he recognize this ? Jake was sitting in front of a completed drawing of a fluffy , assertivelooking white cockatoo with a few yellow feathers sticking up in a crest . Eyes still fixed on the picture , he said , " That 's Theodora . I wonder if she 's seen this . It 'll make her mad as hell if she recognizes herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " How do you like Walter 's work ? " " I like it very much . Very much . " " He 's gotten really good . He always drew stuff , even back in Vietnam , but in the past year or two , he 's found . . . oh , I guess his style , or whatever it is artists have to find . He could make some money at it if he 'd get with the program . " " What program ? " " Oh , Theodora has lots of good ideas about how to sell . She got them to hang some of his stuff in the cafe over near the Crossroads up near the 128 turnoff . Occasionally someone walks in and buys one . And she thinks she might get him a show in Austin . " " How do you suppose he 's managing captivity ? " Molly asked . Jake wheeled his chair to the window and looked out at the field of wildflowers . " Hating it . More than anyone I know , he hates having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . He hates guns . " " What about children ? " Molly asked . Jake smiled . " I do n't think he hates children , but I do n't know that he likes them very much either . Other than driving that bus for a few months , I do n't think he 's ever had much to do with them . " " Would he be a cool head in a crisis , if it comes to it ? " " Cool ? " Jake 's face colored suddenly and his lips tightened . " You ask if Walter 's cool ? See if this fits your idea of cool  --  a man lying in the muck at the edge of a stinking river surrounded by seven bloody corpses , pretending to be dead while Vietcong go around checking on their handiwork . The body on one side of him , that used to be Greg Meeks , gets both ears sliced off with a bayonet . Those ears are strung on a necklace of similar objects one of the gooks is wearing . The gook then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pokes at one with his bayonet . Then he moves on to Junior Carlyle , or what remains of him , lying on  | Walter 's left . The gook leans down and cuts off Junior 's ears . " Jake continued to stare out at the wildflowers . His voice revealed no emotion . " I did n't have time right then to wonder what it was about Walter 's ears that did n't appeal , but I sure have thought about it since . Walter has small ears , real tight to his head , with almost no lobe . Maybe that was it . But I think it was the color . Both Meeks and Carlyle were black . I think this particular gook was specializing in black ears . While he was adding ears to his collection , Walter just lay there , his mouth and eyes full of muck . No twitching , no whining , no breathing . Is Walter a cool head ? you ask me . Lady , the man 's subzero . " Molly found it hard to catch her breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then was the world ended . This freak Samuel Mordecai says the world 's going to end on Friday . I know that 's not true because it ended on September 2 , 1968 . The ears were just a tremor in the earth , a warning . " He whirled his chair around . " Anyway , it 's ancient history now , and not much of a subject for a pretty spring day . Let 's go see Theodora . She always makes me feel like the world makes sense . " He wheeled his chair back to the door . " Let 's walk on the road . It 's shorter to go across the field and I can do it in my chair , but it 's hard going . " They both went down the ramp and Jake led the way back to the road and down to the next driveway . The house had a front porch with fat pots of red geraniums on the steps . A large golden retriever with a completely white head lay sleeping on the porch with its paws dangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house dashed a brown-and-white spaniel , who started to yap at them . But the dog came to a sudden stop , staring at a spot behind Molly . She turned and was surprised to see that Copper had followed them . The big dog was standing with his fur bristling and his teeth bared . The spaniel turned and ran back the way it had come , disappearing around the house . " Probably a wise move , " Jake said . The dog on the porch had n't even opened an eye . Molly watched Copper approach stiff-legged , growling low in his throat . " Oh , God , I left the leash in the truck . " She started forward to grab the dog 's collar . Jake raised a hand . " Hold on . It 'll be okay . " Reluctantly , Molly stood where she was . When Copper stepped on the first stair , growling , the old retriever opened one eye , then the other , and watched Copper approach . Then , when Copper was almost on the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paws in the air . Copper stopped and the growling died away . The erect fur flattened ; he approached and sniffed the older dog 's tail and belly .  | Molly had been so riveted by the performance , she had n't noticed a woman come out the door . The woman was standing still , watching the dogs with a smile of bemused interest on her face . Now she said , " Maggie could teach us all something . Sometimes pacifism works . Hey , there , Jake Alesky . I 've missed you , dear heart . " She walked briskly down the steps and leaned over to embrace Jake . A snarling from the porch caused her to straighten up . Copper was starting down the steps toward her . " Oh , my , " the woman said . Molly felt a flush of embarrassment . She moved forward and grabbed Copper 's collar . Her hand was shaking , but she managed to hold on and say in a firm voice , " No , Copper . Sit . " She was relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " He 's not my dog . He gets confused when people have contact . He 's a retired police dog , a bit unbalanced . I 'm sorry . " Jake said , " Theodora , this is Molly Cates . She works for Lone Star Monthly and she 's writing something about the Jezreel mess . I 've been telling her about Walter . Molly , meet Theodora Shea . " Molly was afraid to let go of Copper 's collar , so she raised her free hand and said , " It 's a pleasure to meet you , Miss Shea . " Theodora Shea was probably in her seventies , smooth-skinned and plump under her loose embroidered Mexican dress . Her fluffy white hair was yellowed and sticking out in places and her prominent nose curved gently . She wore white face powder . A cockatoo indeed . The resemblance made Molly . smile . Molly , will you help me bring some chairs down from the porch so we can sit and talk a bit ? " Theodora asked . Molly looked down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance and let go of his collar . Then she carried two wicker chairs from the porch and put them at the foot of the steps , one on either side of Jake 's wheelchair . Although both Jake and Molly declined the offer of refreshments , Theodora excused herself and was back in a few minutes bearing a tray with three glasses of lemonade and three huge slices of chocolate cake . She set the tray down on the bottom step and shot both dogs a warning look . " With Walter gone and the poetry group not meeting , I 'm drowning in cake . You young people can help me out . " She handed icy glasses to Molly and Jake . Molly refused cake , but Jake took his plate and rested it on what lap he had , which was just large enough to support the plate . Theodora sat down and said , " We have got to do something . Two FBI agents came to see me the second week , and I told them exactly  | what I thought about this madman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just not going to work . " She took a sip of her lemonade . Molly noticed how moist and rich the cake looked as the forkfuls moved steadily from Jake 's plate to his mouth , how fluffy the white filling in between the layers looked . " Is that whipped cream ? " she asked . " Yes . " Theodora reached over to pick up a piece from the tray and hand it to Molly . " We need to snipe him and have the SWAT team move in like the wrath of God , before they have a chance to harm the hostages . I feel certain that Walter would agree with this assessment . " " They ca n't snipe him , " Molly said with her mouth full . " He never shows himself , never even passes an uncovered window . " Theodora took a long , hard look at Molly . " How do you know that ? " " My ex-husband , Grady , is an Austin cop who 's on the negotiating team . " Theodora ran her hand through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't got it from the news , because I watch and read everything . Would they snipe him if they could ? " " That 's a tough one . The problem is they 're a civilian agency . Mordecai has never been convicted of a crime and he 's not actually killing anyone right now that we know of . It 's a moot point anyway since he keeps out of sight . " " What does this ex-husband of yours think is the next step ? " " They 're reevaluating it , " Molly said . Theodora made a clucking noise . " Oh , come , come . You 're among friends . Cut the jargon . " Molly smiled . " Okay . Every time they talk to Mordecai he reminds them that he will kill the hostages the second anyone sets foot inside his fence . The reason they have n't moved in is that they believe that . But , if you believe Mordecai 's timetable , we 've only got three days left now . Grady thinks it might come to SWAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Hostage Response Team . He sees them as an absolute last resort because of the high risk to the hostages , but the negotiation 's gone nowhere . One problem the HRT has , though , is they do n't know where on the twelve acres the hostages are . " " That 's a big problem , " Theodora conceded . " A big problem . " Jake was quiet . He 'd already finished his cake and was going after the crumbs by mashing them onto his fork . Theodora noticed his empty plate . She leaned over , took it from him , and handed him another one . " Oh , this is intolerable , " she said , " the waiting . Does n't it make you want to march right in there and give them what for ? " " No , " Molly said , " it makes me want to run and hide until it 's over . "  | " Me , too , " Jake said . " You say the negotiators are discouraged . I believe it . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looks like he 's giving up . " " They are discouraged . " " If that negotiator friend of yours gets to speak to Walter , " Theodora said , " I 'd like to send Walter a message . Ask him to send my love and tell him how much we miss him in the poetry group . We have n't done anything since he 's been gone . It just does n't feel right to go on without him . I 'd like him to know we are waiting for him . " " Poetry group ? " Molly asked . " Yes . A group of us who enjoy poetry . We get together here every week . The last few months we 've been reading Emily Dickinson . Oh , I just wish I could send Walter a complete Dickinson right now . He likes to memorize poetry . It 's such a comfort during difficult times to have in your head when you need it . " " Need it ? " Molly said . " Yes . I 'm afraid by now he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read poetry ? " " Almost never , " Molly admitted . " I wish I did . But I ca n't imagine needing it . And Emily Dickinson ! I have unpleasant memories of a high school anthology : There is no frigate like a book . ' " " Oh , it 's such a crime the way they teach poetry in schools , especially the way they teach Dickinson . Really , she has so much to say to these alienated young people . She 's very accessible . I taught English for thirty years , before I retired , and sometimes I worry that the readers of poetry are dying off one by one . I have this recurring vision that one day the very last of us will be walking home from a library with a book under her arm and keel over and that will be the end of the breed , and no one will ever know or mourn it . " Molly glanced up at the porch . The retriever was lying in the same place and Copper was lying next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They seem to have hit it off , do n't they ? " Theodora said . " Maggie makes friends easily . " Jake said , " I 've never seen Maggie do anything but lie right there at the top of those steps with her eyes closed . " Theodora laughed . " Maybe that 's one good way to make friends ? just make space for them on your porch . " Jake handed Theodora his plate , from which he 'd cleaned every crumb . " Thanks . It was delicious as usual , but we have to go . Can you keep on checking the house ? "  | " Sure . No trouble . Do n't you worry , Jake . " She turned to Molly . " Wait a minute . I 'd like to give you something to take with you . " She bounded up the steps and returned in a few minutes with a large tinfoil package and a fat book . She handed the package to Jake . " It would be a favor to me to get some of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The book she handed to Molly . It was The Complete Poems of Emily Dickin-son . " I 'd appreciate it if you would give it to your negotiator friend , in case he gets a chance to send it in to Walter . Would you do that for me , please , Molly ? " Molly had to stifle a snort , thinking about Grady 's response to that request . It was ludicrous . In the hierarchy of things she 'd like to send in to the hostages , a book of poems by a repressed New England spinster was at the bottom of the list . Better to send them chocolate cake . " Sure , " she told Theodora Shea , sticking the book in her bag .  | " You kids know what a vegetable peeler is , " Walter Demming said . " Your mother has one , I bet , in the kitchen drawer . Along with all the stuff like corkscrews and garlic presses and spoons with holes  --  you know , the stuff she uses for cooking . " " My mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take home from Mc-Donald 's or sometimes Chinese . " When she spoke the word " Chi-nese , " her face glowed , as though just saying the word had filled her mouth with juicy , succulent bliss . Walter 's mouth watered in response , and for an instant he tasted and smelled the chicken in hot garlic sauce from China Sea , where he and Jake often got takeout dinners , which they ate on Jake 's veranda , with lots of Shiner Bock to wash it down . " I love Chinese food . " Sandra closed her book and abandoned all pretense of not listening . " Egg rolls , fried rice , sweet-and-sour pork . There 's a place near us that delivers . " " My mom cooks really good , " Hector said . " The best tamales . The best . Everybody says so . They 're so good she sells them and every year she does this thing for the church where she makes hundreds of them and they raise lots of money by selling them . If I could have anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a huge pan of my mom 's tamales . When we get out of here , my mom will have a party for us and we 'll stuff ourselves with her tamales  --  as many as we want . " " My dad cooks , " Josh said , " and I help him . We 've got a couple of those vegetable peelers . We use them to peel potatoes when we 're mak-  | They 're even slower than we human beings , and by the standards of the animal world , we are pretty darn slow . " Conrad laughed . " That 's why you always see them squished on the road . Ugh . " " Roadkill . " Sue Ellen wrinkled her nose . " Road pizza , " Hector said . " Highway hamburger ! " Heather called . " Great green gobs of greasy , grimy gopher guts ! " " Blasted armadillo butts , " Josh chimed in . " Mutilated monkey meat . " " Dirty turkey vulture feet , " Walter sang . They all laughed uproariously . Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . He had n't heard much of it lately . He wished he could sing and tell jokes , make up songs , entertain them , but he could n't . His story would have to do . " On his way to town , Lopez came to this neighborhood where giant anteaters lived . These are cousins of the armadillo  --  they 're both edentates --  -- but anteaters are much bigger , and they have long hollow noses , really long . And claws that are awesome . And when Lopez set eyes on the female anteaters , well , he just could n't believe it . They were so big and glossy . And they had these long , plumy tails that swayed when they walked . He loved looking at them . " Hector and Kim laughed . " And the anteaters were all eating slumber bugs  --  they had camped out next to a huge hill that was just chock-full of them . Also , they were drinking cheap wine from jugs . They had a huge supply of that , too . " Walter stopped . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . His mind kept wandering back to the phone call he was going to make . Martin said it would happen around ten and they would come get him right before that . Now it was almost nine and he wanted to go into a corner and practice some more . He wanted to have some time alone to be silent and get prepared . This was the last chance . He tried to imagine what was going on aboveground , but he had so little to go on . " Mr. Demming . Earth to Mr. Demming . Go on , " Lucy said . " Right . Now . . . Let 's see . Were we talking about Lopez ? He knew he should be looking for Jacksonville , but one of the females invited him to visit awhile . And one thing led to another . Lopez ate slumber bugs , he drank wine , he kissed the female anteaters , and he fell asleep again . When he woke up it was dark and he felt really guilty about Jacksonville . So he asked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Someone told him about the Tongs capturing a buzzard and dragging him off .  | " Lopez did n't know what to do . He was scared to go into the Tong camp alone , so he got the anteaters to go along with him  --  for protection . He bribed them . He promised if they came and helped him rescue his buddy , he would buy them some more wine . So they all went to the Tong camp . It was dark and they saw the fire , so they crept up to it and looked through the bushes . In the firelight they saw the big pot boiling and all the Tongs gathered in a circle around poor Dr. Mortimer . " Now Lopez knew they were going to have to do something right quick if they were going to save the doctor . He had to come up with a plan . What he did was this : He told all the giant anteaters to suck wine up into their long snouts and spray it out . But that plan did n't work because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he had to figure out something else . " Now , it happened that all the anteaters who 'd come with him were boys . The girls had all gone to bed . So here 's what Lopez did : He got the anteaters to line up . There were lots of them and they 'd all drunk so much wine they were full of it . He counted to five and at the same time they all peed on the Tongs . Long streams of pee . " Walter stopped because the kids were laughing . It was a cheap shot . After forty-eight days with this age group , he knew how popular bathroom jokes were . Hector said through his laughter , " That 's great . I thought Lopez had something to do with it . " " Did n't the Tongs know it was pee ? " Heather asked . " You can smell it . " " Well , they noticed that it was different from normal rain and that 's one of the things that scared them . But it smelled more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Walter knew he was n't making any sense . He was barely able to concentrate now , thinking about the phone call coming up . " My mom drinks wine , " Heather said , " and even when she says she has n't been , I know she has because I can smell it . Was it red or white wine ? " " It was white wine , " Walter told her . " Tongs do n't use alcohol at all , so they really are n't familiar with its smell the way you are , Heather . " Walter looked at his watch . He could n't concentrate . He was just too preoccupied to go on . His head was churning with anxieties . If only he knew what was happening aboveground . Martin spoke of the negotiators as if they were just a part of everyday life . So maybe there had been ongoing conversation during these endless days . His only contact with the negotiators , the only reason he knew for sure they were out there , had been the half-minute conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd had a conversation . Walter had read , at gunpoint , a statement Mordecai handed him : " My name is Walter Demming . The eleven children are with me . We are all safe and being taken care of . Samuel Mordecai is in charge here . He has an important message for the world . ' " A voice had said , " Mr. Demming , I 'm Andrew Stein of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . We are doing everything we can to secure your release . The safety of you and the children is our primary concern . What can we ? " At that point Samuel Mordecai had taken over the phone and Walter had been dragged back to the barn through a wooden corridor . Then they pulled the wooden slab aside and shoved him back down into the buried bus . That was the only time he 'd been aboveground in fortyeight days . The only time he 'd heard a voice from the outside world . Surely by now the FBI knew that Mordecai was no negotiator . The man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Walter had vague recollections of news items about hostage situations and the Waco standoff . There was something in Utah and something in California , he thought , but he could n't remember the details . So what were the negotiators thinking of ? Walter had been awake all night thinking about the negotiators , wondering how smart they were , wondering if what he was going to try was worth the risk . He was going to try to tell them they were all underground , in the barn . He was going to try to tell them that they should attack and he would keep the kids down and safe for as long as it took . But it would work only if the people on the receiving end of his message were creative in trying to figure it out , only if they went to the trouble of talking to the important people in his life  --  Jake and Theodora . Certainly they would locate Jake . But Theodora ? He just did n't know . " Mr. Demming , are you all right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , huh ? " " Yes . " He looked up at the kids . " I 'm sort of preoccupied , thinking about the phone call . I could use a little quiet time to get myself ready . I want to give your messages just right . " " Mr. Demming , " Conrad said , " I want to change my message . Can I do some more ? " " No . Remember , we timed it at one minute . You can change what you 've got if it 's the same length . " " Oh , I guess not then . I was just thinking . When we were talking about food , I got to thinking about the fried liver my mom ? " " Liver ! " Sandra grimaced . " Barf . " " Mr. Demming , " Lucy said , " what happens if we get rescued before you finish the story ? "  | Walter held up two fingers as though he were taking the Boy Scout oath . " I promise you this , Lucy goosey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you all together and do it later . Maybe when Hector 's mom has us over for tamales . " Ten minutes later , as Walter was reading over the twelve messages for the hundredth time , the wooden cover scraped back and they all looked toward the pit . " It 's time ! " Martin 's head appeared upside down next to the bulb at the bus door . " Come on , Bus Driver . I 'll give you a hand up . " " Okay . " Walter stood up . He folded his paper and tucked it into his shirt pocket . He glanced toward the empty fourth seat where he 'd stuffed the knife inside a rip and deep under the padding for safekeeping . " I wo n't be long , " he said , looking around at the kids . Hector came up close and gave him a little punch in the chest . " Good luck , man . " He stood on his tiptoes and whispered into Walter 's ear , " This is going to work for us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seen it in that movie The Silence of the Lambs . They 'll figure it out . " Walter tried to smile . What he was planning to do seemed so ridiculous . He was taking a big risk for something that seemed impossibly unrealistic , as ephemeral as to touch him . Walter stopped and took each hand in turn , engulfing each smaller hand in both of his and squeezing . It was as if he were receiving from each of them a surge of power and confidence . By the time he got to the door , he felt all things were possible .  | He called just after midnight . " How 's my dog ? " Molly had been asleep for less than an hour . She turned over and looked down at the floor where the dog lay in the pale spill from the nightlight  --  a huge dark shape stretched out next to her bed . Earlier , she 'd closed the door to keep him out of the bedroom , but he 'd kept her awake whining and scratching on the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At least he does n't smell bad , " she said , her voice hoarse with sleep . She reached down to pat his head . " I hope he does n't have fleas . " " Not Copper , " Grady said . " We went out to the country . He made a friend  --  a senile golden retriever  --  but he nearly killed her first . " " Ah , " he said . " You 're bonding with him . I can tell . " She sat up and leaned against the headboard . " You found some-thing . " " You sound sleepy . What are you wearing ? " " Oh , so this is one of those calls . " " Uh-huh . What have you got on ? " " Chanel No. 5 and the radio . " She laughed . " I think I 'll come over and see my dog . " " Come . But first tell me what you 've found . " " Lots of dust , pill bugs , a few spiders  --  and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Come on , Grady . Do n't toy with me . " " Molly , you really live right . " Her heartbeat quickened . " The officer who made that report about the baby on August 3 , 1962 , was Patrolman Oscar Mendez . I checked the roster . Mendez retired in ' 78 and died in ' 91 . " So it was a dead end . Molly felt a pang of disappointment . " That 's living right ? " she asked . " Just wait , " Grady said . " The jogger who found the baby in the cooler and called the police was one Jerry Brinker , who lived with his sister in Westlake Hills . " " Lived ? " " Yeah . I tracked the sister down . Jerry died last year . Heart attack while jogging on the hike-and-bike trail . " " Oh , shit . " " Now do n't forget you are talking to one of the most indefatigable investigators in the history of the Austin PD . With a computer and a telephone there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a witness who saw Jerry find the baby . His name is Hank Hanley . " " Is ? " " Yes , ma'am . A twenty-year-old homeless man at the time , living along Waller Creek . And guess what ? " " What ? " " Hank 's now a fifty-three-year-old homeless man living along Waller Creek and sometimes , in really inclement weather , at the Salvation Army . He often takes his meals there . " " Does he have a sheet ? " " Sure . The usual class C misdemeanors  --  seventeen arrests for public intoxication and nine for trespass . Not too bad for a wino with such a long career . But he also has three arrests for peeping . " " How did you track him down ? " " A combination of technology and native cop cunning . " " Oh , Grady , I do love you . " " Because I 'm a crack investigator ? " " That . And because you fix toilets . " " See , I 'm useful around the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have me on call twenty-four hours a day . " " Like a live-in janitor ? " " Janitor , handyman , cop , lover , masseur  --  you can have it all . " " Tempting . We 'll talk about it sometime . "  | " Okay . Do you want to take over on Hank Hanley , Molly ? Or shall I go roust him now , rough him up a little ? " She switched on the lamp so she could think better . " He 'll know you 're a cop and he might clam up . This is delicate . I think I 'll take it . First thing in the morning . God , I hope he has n't totally pickled his brains . Come over and tell me how you worked these miracles . Bring dog food , so you can feed the beast before you go back to Jezreel in the morning . " " I 'm on my way . " She woke to the tickle of fingertips brushing down her spine , caressing one vertebra at a time , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the butterflies spread out , fluttering along her ribs , under her arms , in circles around her breasts , and down her stomach , making her skin quiver in their path . " Mmmm , " she said . " Do n't stop . " A voice whispered in her ear , " I could wake you up every morning . How about an alarm clock that wakes you like this ? " Lips touched the rim of her ear and the nape of her neck . " Mmmm . Yes . That would be good . But what else would it do ? Show me the full range . " " Let 's see , there would be two hands coming out , like this . " He cupped her breasts . " Or maybe three hands . " He moved his foot up her leg , running the toes slowly from her ankle up her inner thigh . " Or four . " He pressed himself against her back . Molly laughed . " No dreading the alarm going off . " " Shhhh . You 'll wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced over the edge of the bed at the dark shape on the floor . She opened her mouth to complain , to tell him that it was absurd to have to keep quiet for a dog , that he should throw the beast out , but Grady stopped all complaint with his mouth . Afterward she asked , " Any news from Jezreel ? " " Nothing . Two more days left on Mordecai 's schedule . By the way , do you know the significance of Jezreel in the Bible ? " " You mean the great Valley of Jezreel where the Battle of Armageddon is going to take place , according to the Book of Revelation ? Two hundred million mounted troops ? Ancient serpents and giant locusts that sting like scorpions ? A third of mankind killed ? Blood rising as high as the horses ' bridles ? " " Molly , you 've been reading the Bible . " " Pretty horrific stuff , Revelation . The end of the world , directed by  | Oliver Stone . I suppose Mordecai picked Jezreel , Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fought there . " " I 'm sorely afraid there will be a battle , " Grady said grimly as he departed . Molly buried her face in the pillow . She tried to go back to sleep ; it was only five-thirty , but Grady had fed the dog and left him outside , and now the wretch was barking . She got up to let him in , thinking about Hank Hanley , who , she was willing to bet , did n't often have people thinking about him . Molly had never been inside the new Salvation Army shelter . It was a huge , stark , red-brick fortress with pinched windows . " Dedicated in 1987 , " said the plaque at the door , " to the glory of God and service to humanity . " Molly recalled that it had taken ten years of fierce wrangling over the location before God and humanity could be served on this rundown block at Eighth and Neches . Everyone in this laid-back and liberal town firmly believed in the cause the Sally served , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reception desk , a young man was watching a portable television . On the screen was the all too familiar profile of the Hearth Jezreelite compound in the background and a local reporter in the foreground . To get the young man 's attention , she had to raise her voice . When he turned reluctantly from the screen , Molly asked , " Anything new happening out there ? " " No , ma'am . " He flicked the sound off . " You know what I think we ought to do ? " Molly had heard countless ideas on the subject in the past forty-eight days . Everyone had an opinion . She scanned the young man 's buzz haircut and earnest jaw and prepared herself for another SWAT fantasy . " What ? " " I think we ought to send in a Trojan horse . " He picked up a paperback book and showed it to her . The Iliad . " With a SWAT team hiding inside ? " " No . Angels . Well , really it would be the FBI , or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dressed up like angels so this Mordecai guy would think they 'd come to fight Armageddon on his side . But under their white robes they 'd have grenades and Uzis and all . They 'd rescue the kids quick and put ' em inside the horse , which would be armored like a tank , and then they 'd kill all those crazies and take the kids home to their mamas. "  | " I like it , " Molly said , thinking it made as much sense as anything the cops had come up with . " Is Hank Hanley on your list for last night ? " He did n't even glance at the list posted on the wall next to him . " No , ma'am . But he usually comes in for breakfast . If you want to wait , he 'll probably be along because we 're just starting to serve . " " Do you know where he usually sleeps ? " " No . Hank likes to sleep raw  --  you know , out in the elements ? rather than here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into his pants . " He guffawed . " Well , maybe they are , " she said . " Wait until you see old Hank , " he told her . " Set yourself down over there and I 'll call you when I spot him . " Molly chose a metal folding chair near the desk and watched the people coming in . Mostly men , they arrived in clusters of three or four . The majority appeared to be what you 'd expect at the Sally  --  the truly down-and-out  --  but a surprising number looked like the middle class with a few wrinkles in their pants . Three women came in carrying shopping bags , arguing in low voices . Molly watched them with fascination . She had been wanting to do an article on homeless women ever since she discovered how many women , herself included , harbored bag-lady nightmares . It seemed especially true of women who were going through a divorce or major life change . The three crones standing in the door arguing could have played the witches in Macbeth . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept , follow them on their daily routines , photograph them . She wanted to know what they carried around in their bags . The young man at the desk called to her , " Ma'am , here he comes . " He walked in alone  --  a cadaverously thin man , stooped , with a grizzled gray-and-ginger beard . Her heart sank . This was going to be a colossal waste of time . He was the walking dead , a poster boy for the horrors that alcohol can inflict on the human body . Hank Hanley looked ninetythree , not fifty-three . His sun- and dirt-stained skin was so dry and wrinkled it looked mummified . He wore Levi 's that would have slid off his hips if two of the belt loops had n't been tied together with a shoelace . His stained white gim me hat said " Hard Rock Cafe  --  London . " Molly rose . " Mr. Hanley ? " He reached up to take off his hat , but he missed it . On the second try he snagged the bill and lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some manners , and they were still there . " Ma'am ? " " I 'm Molly Cates , Mr. Hanley . Could we sit down and talk for a minute ? "  | His sunken eyes darted around in confusion and his jaw quivered . " Do I know you , ma'am ? " " No . But I sure would appreciate it if you 'd give me a few minutes of your time . " " I ai n't done nothing wrong , " he insisted . " Oh , no . I just want to talk . " His darty eyes came to rest on her . " Not a cop . " Molly chuckled . " Definitely not a cop . A writer . " Hank raised a shaky hand to his beard . " A writer . " " Yes . Maybe I could take you out to breakfast , " she suggested . " Is there somewhere around here you like better than this ? " He began to scratch furiously at his beard . " I like the House of Pancakes right well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to treat you . My truck 's up the street . We 'll drive . " " Oh , yes , ma'am . " " Molly , " she said . " Call me Molly and I 'll call you Hank . " In the morning heat they walked to the truck and talked about the weather . It turned out that the weather was Hank 's best subject , something he was very much in touch with . Hottest spring in eleven years , he told her . Humid , more rainfall than average . More mosquitoes and fire ants than anyone could remember . Fleas something fierce . As they crossed Eighth Street , she felt the urge to hold on to his arm , to protect him , so precious was he  --  the only living link to that old event . It was hopeless , of course . This wreck of a man was unlikely to remember his own middle name , let alone the details of finding a discarded infant more than three decades ago . Even if there was something to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pancake house , the hostess took one look at Hank and bristled . She was slow in seating them , and when she leaned over to hand him a menu , her nostrils flared in protest . After the waitress slapped down two mugs and poured them some coffee , Molly got down to business : " Hank , how 's your memory ? " He gave a creaky-sounding chuckle . " My memory , ma'am ? Like a piece of Swiss cheese . " He took a long , loud slurp of his coffee . " So 's mine , " Molly said . They both laughed , that rueful , knowing laugh people tended to reserve for the frailties of their own aging . " But there are some things that happened to me many years ago that were so unusual , so striking , that I will never forget them . " Molly tried to look into his dark eyes for a response , but they looked blank . " I bet there are things like that for you , Hank . " " I remember my mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | Molly smiled at him . Maybe , just maybe . " Hank , a long time ago you were down by Waller Creek when a man found a baby . You remember ? A baby boy floating in a beer cooler . " She watched his face . Slowly his mouth opened , as if in wonderment . The few teeth left to him looked as if their days were numbered . " I 'd like you to tell me about that , " she said . " A long time ago , " he said . " Yes . Thirty-three years . " " But how did you know ? " " You mean that you were there ? " He nodded . " From the report the patrolman wrote , the officer who came and took the baby . You remember that ? He took your name down . " Hank nodded . " Hank , please tell me about that day . " " I did n't do nothing wrong . I was just down there by the creek . " He set his dry lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly said . She paused , feeling herself inching out onto some thin ice . She needed to give him a reason for her questions , something to calm his anxieties . Of course , she could n't tell him the real reason . If she told him that the baby found that day had grown up to be Samuel Mordecai , it would be public within hours . She 'd seen it happen before . This man sitting across from her would be selling his story to national magazines ; he 'd be an instant celebrity , get a new suit , go on Oprah and Hard Copy . If this lead was to turn into something with some bargaining power , it needed secrecy . Molly Cates tried not to tell lies . She 'd been reared by a father and an aunt who came down hard on the side of truth . When she did lie , she tried to be careful to tell only lies that would not be found out later . She also tried to restrict herself to lies she could rationalize as having some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hank Hanley , she was aware of how lie leads on to lie , and that this one was likely to be only the first of many . " The reason I 'm asking , " she said , " is that the baby grew up and now he 's a friend of mine and he wants to find his parents , his real mother . He asked me to help him . " Hank licked his lips and said , " He grew up . How is he ? " " He 's good . A fine young man . " She was tempted to elaborate , but she stopped herself . " What does he do ? " Hank asked . " He 's an accountant with a wife and two daughters . But you know how it is  --  he 's thirty-three now and he wants to find his real mama and  | papa . " She thought about telling how he 'd worked his way through college and played soccer , but she made herself quit there . Hank 's eyes began to water . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so small . " He cupped his trembling hands to show how small the baby was . " He was wrapped up in this real shiny red blanket . " " Yes . I have that blanket . Actually it 's a silk bathrobe . " " Is it now ? How about that . Just how about that . . . " Hank seemed to be coming to life , getting some animation in his voice . Maybe it was the coffee . Maybe it was remembering the event . The waitress arrived to take their order . Hank , his eyes still watering , ordered eggs , hash browns , and a side stack of buttermilk pancakes . Molly ordered French pancakes with no orange sauce . " Hank , would you tell me how it happened ? Everything you can remember . " " This ai n't gon na get me in trouble , is it ? I do n't want no trouble . " " Absolutely not . " " Well , if it 'll help that young fella . An accountant , you say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny baby , so small . I think he was just born . " " That 's right . When the policeman took him to the hospital , the doctor said he was only a few hours old . " " So . Well . " Hank shook his head . He seemed to have forgotten he was telling a story , so Molly prodded him . " What were you doing down at the creek ? " " Oh , sleeping , I was sleeping there . See , it was early in the morning . I was just sleeping , that 's all . Just sleeping . " Molly could see that if she was going to get anything out of him she was going to have to drag it out , word by word . " Tell me about finding the baby . Did you see it first , or did the other man ? " " The other man , the runner . He saw it first . " " Uh-huh . " " See , I got up to . . . uh , use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know this is real clear . I remember this part real good . He was running by , black shorts and no shirt . " He looked up at Molly . " I wonder what happened to him . " " He died last year , while he was jogging . " " Died ? Oh , he looked so . . . healthy . " His eyes watered again and this time some of it overflowed and ran down into his beard . He seemed not to notice . Molly could n't decide if they were tears or the product of some rheumy eye condition . Warmed up now , he went on talking without any prodding . " That man , the jogger , he stopped and made this little noise . Like Ooh . ' And  | then he stepped into the water  --  it was real shallow there  --  and he grabbed up this white cooler . I remember what he said exactly . Is n't that something ? After all this time I can still remember the exact words . Like you say , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are real unusual and this was real unusual . It sure was . " He shook his head in amazement . " What did he say ? " " He said , Holy Jesus , it 's a live kid in here . ' Then he said , Who would leave a kid like this ? ' and he picked the baby up and held it against his chest . He was all wet from sweating and the baby was all wet from , I guess , wetting himself . That baby did n't cry or nothing . " Hank stopped and stared into space . " Did n't make a sound . " " What happened then ? " " Well , I came up and the two of us decided we needed to find some help . So we walked up to the road . He kept that baby held tight to his chest with both hands , and called out to some people at one of the university buildings to call a policeman and he got there in just a few minutes . When the cop saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer to come help and she come and took the baby off . To the hospital , I guess . " " Then what ? " " Let 's see . Gets a little cloudy for me here . I think we took the cop back down to where we 'd left the cooler and showed him where we found the baby . That 's when he wrote our names down , I think . And then he drove off . " Their plates arrived and Hank fell on his pancakes with vigor . After a few bites , he stopped . " You know something ? That baby never cried once . An accountant , huh ? " Molly drizzled some maple syrup on her pancakes . " Hank , before the jogger came by did you see anyone else around ? " " Do n't believe so , " he said with his mouth full of pancakes . " No . Just the jogger . " He gave a little laugh . " And the baby . " " But you 'd been sleeping near there , you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . you know , sleeping . You do n't see nothing when you 're sleeping . " " Was there anyone else there with you ? " " No . I stay alone ' cause these other bums , they always want some-thing . " " What about during the night ? Did you hear anything ? " " You know , ma'am , I drank a bit back then . When I went off to sleep nothing much could wake me up . " Molly felt the dull ache of a dead end approaching . There are some  | questions that never get answered . Sometimes you just had to accept that . Hank devoted himself to breakfast with the single-mindedness of a bird going after a worm , and Molly , inspired , did the same . She paid and they left with the hostess scowling at their backs . As they walked through the parking lot , Molly was feeling the old desperation that accompanied dead ends . " Shall I drop you back at the Sally ? " she asked Hank as she unlocked the truck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the blood bank over on Tiventyninth Street , if you 're going that way . " Molly did not ask him about the blood bank ; the idea of selling blood , let alone the idea of him selling blood , was just too much for her to tackle . As she drove up Trinity , she got to thinking about the baby floating in Waller Creek and she wanted to be able to visualize it . That gave her an idea . It was probably desperation , mixed with her usual oxlike resistance to giving up something she wanted . " Hank , before I drop you off , will you show me the place on Waller Creek where you found the baby ? It 's not too far from here , is it ? " " Not far . I go there sometimes . I 'll show you . " He directed her up Trinity to just past MLK . " Here , " he said . " Right here . " It was on the edge of the university campus , where parking was always impossible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she should start deducting her considerable parking fines as business ex-penses . Hank led the way across the street to a stone bridge . They passed by Santa Rita No. 1 , the old drilling rig that had first hit oil on land owned by the University of Texas . The rig had been moved from West Texas to the campus as a reminder of where the steady stream of money that supported the university came from . What Molly loved about it was that it talked . From a little speaker mounted on top emanated a continuous narration  --  the story of the miraculous gusher in 1923 . This memorial was such a good idea , Molly thought , everyone ought to have something similar set up as a continual reminder of one 's origins and source of revenue . It was like her keeping her daddy 's old typewriter and Webster 's dictionary next to her computer to remind her of where her respect for words came from . Hank did n't even glance at the oil rig that talked . He led her to one end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees that hid the path there . It was a muddy incline , steep and rough . Hank navigated it with the ease of a frequent traveler . Molly followed , sliding and grabbing tree branches for support . At the bottom , a clearing dipped  | downward to the creek , which was bubbling along under the arch of the bridge . " This way . " Hank turned and disappeared under the bridge . Molly hesitated when she saw how dark it was underneath , but she followed along on the gravel ridge that ran next to the water . Flattened cardboard cartons , brown bags containing empty whiskey bottles , and discarded rags indicated human habitation there . They emerged into a bucolic scene of tall trees and dense foliage on both sides of the creek . Way below street level , they were invisible to the people passing above . It felt as if they 'd dropped into some secret underworld , totally separate from the bustle of campus life above them . Like the area under the bridge , this clearing was littered with debris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the air of a tour guide . " Everything used to be cleaner . " He led the way to some flat white rocks jutting out into the creek . He stepped onto the rocks and pointed to an area about three feet away . " Right there . That cooler was right there stuck on some rocks . " He looked up suddenly , his attention caught by the sound of laughter up at the top of the bank across the creek . Two girls in shorts and T-shirts stood laughing in a gap in the trees . Molly was surprised to see through the opening a running track and , in the distance , picnic tables and basketball hoops . It was a recreation area for students . Hank licked his dry lips . " Has this always been a running track and recreation area ? " Molly asked him . He was so riveted watching the girls , he did n't respond . Molly reached out and touched him on the arm . He jumped as though he 'd been stung . " It 's fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " They 're so young and full of life . And from down here you can watch without them knowing it . " He did something she 'd never seen anyone do before . He took his lower lip between his teeth and pulled at a loose piece of skin there , tugging at it until he 'd ripped it loose . It left a raw place on his thin lip that began to ooze a drop of blood . He licked the blood away and said , " I come here sometimes . If they 're there , I look . Of course , I never .. . you know I would n't never ... " " I know , Hank . There 's no harm in watching . " " No , " he said . " They 're sorority girls . " " Oh ? " " You can tell by the writing on their shirts . " Molly squinted and saw that both girls had Greek letters printed on the front of their T-shirts . " Those foreign letters mean they belong to a sorority. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see those letters around here all the time . " " Do you ? " " Uh-huh . And you know , that day you was asking about ? " " Yes ? " Molly asked it carefully , not wanting to stop this flow . " I never told this to no one , but I seen two girls with them foreign letters . " " You did ? Like those two ? " " The letters were different and they were n't laughing . " He nodded toward the top of the bank where the girls were still talking . Their laughter drifted down . " They were n't laughing ? " He shook his head sadly . " One was bawling . " Molly 's scalp was tingling . " One of the girls was crying ? " He seemed lost in the memory . " And they had letters on their shirts , but not the same as those . I should 've told you before , I guess . " He made a sound that strained to be a laugh . " That Swiss-cheese head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see this girl crying ? " " Before we found the baby . " " How long before ? " " Just maybe a few minutes . When I got up to do my business that morning . " Hank licked at his bloody lip again . " They was climbing the hill . One was crying and moaning , leaning on the other . That 's when I saw their shirts had them foreign letters . I did n't know they left a little baby or I would 've called them back . Doing something like that leads to no good for no one . You say your friend is doing good , an accountant and all , but I do n't know . If he was doing so good , why does he have to send you to do this for him ? And I can tell you them girls was doing poorly that day . No good comes from that . Secrets and feeling shame . " Molly was amazed by the length and emotion of the speech . " No . You 're right , Hank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was so long ago . And I seen so many girls since then . " This was impossible , like trying to squeeze juice from a stone . " You remember anything about them ? " " Just the letters on their shirts . " " The letters on their shirts ? What were they ? " " Oh , I ca n't read them . I do n't know no languages but English . " Molly had a sudden inspiration . " Can you draw them ? " " Well . . . sure . " He squatted down and picked up an oval stone . He used the edge to draw in the dirt . " Both the same . Here 's what them letters looked like . " He drew slowly : HAS2 . Pi Alpha Omega
