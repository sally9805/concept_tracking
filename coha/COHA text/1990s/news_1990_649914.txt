<p> The Israeli Government 's behavior toward the United States over the last two weeks appears to be based on a delusion . That is the belief that Israel can deceive the American Government , provoke it , injure its interests - and still get uncritical American support for whatever Israel wants . <p> Only such a belief can explain the Shamir Government 's decision to break a solemn undertaking , just given to Washington , that it would not build new housing for Soviet emigrants on land won in the 1967 war . Only such a belief can explain its contemptuous rejection of U.S. concern about the killing of 21 Palestinians in Jerusalem . <p> When the police shot the Palestinians last week , Israeli spokesmen blamed the victims . The police had fired only to save their own lives from Palestinian rioters , the spokesmen said , and to save Jewish worshipers from stones thrown by Palestinians . <p> Israel 's Police Minister , Ronnie Milo , said , " The rioters were sent into action by outside instructions with the aim of diverting world public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same line , and some U.S. commentators charged explicitly that the incident had been staged by Saddam Hussein . <p> Every one of those claims has now been rejected by competent unofficial investigations . A leading Israeli human rights group , B'Tselem , and a Palestinian group , Al Haq , inquired and reached conclusions that substantially overlapped . Foreign correspondents on the scene came to similar conclusions . <p> All those investigators agreed that the deadly police fire came long after worshipers at the wall below had left and when the police themselves were in no danger . It was 15 minutes after an initial clash when the police stormed onto the plaza outside the two great mosques and sprayed a Palestinian crowd with gunfire . <p> " The shooting took place in bursts of unaimed automatic-weapon fire from the hip , " the B'Tselem report said , " spraying a large area . " If there was mortal danger to the police , it added , " this was a brief stage at the beginning of the riot , " long before the police attacked with live ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a videotape that had time stamps on it and showed the time gap before the police , in no danger , attacked . Joel Brinkley of The New York Times reported physical evidence that the police chased Palestinians for hundreds of yards , shooting and killing . <p> As for the assertion that the Palestinians or Saddam Hussein planned a riot , the B'Tselem report said : " We do not know of any preparations for violent action . " <p> Rather , the unofficial investigations concluded that the Palestinians had gone there to protest a planned march that day by a Jewish extremist group that wants to tear the mosques down and build a new version of Solomon 's Temple . The group had much publicity for its planned events , and the Palestinian community was highly agitated . <p> The Israeli Supreme Court had barred a plan to lay a cornerstone for the proposed temple , but the temple group was told that it could march around the mosques . That morning the police vetoed the march , too , but the Palestinian crowd may not all have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stone-throwing began remains unclear . It was in any case reprehensible . But there could still be no justification for unthreatened police to spray automatic-weapons fire at a crowd - in violation of their own rules . <p> The official Israeli inquiry into the shootings is said to be nearly finished . If the report is candid , it could undo some of the harm the Government has done itself by its callous dismissal of concern about the deaths . The report could also , conceivably , be given to the United Nations as a way of satisfying its frustrated inquiry . <p> There remains the question of housing for Soviet Jews . Washington agreed this month to guarantee $400 million in housing loans , in return for a promise that the building would be in " areas which were subject to Israel 's administration prior to June 7 , 1967 . " Yet Israel is moving to settle Soviet Jews in new subsidized housing to be built in East Jerusalem , taken in the 1967 war . <p> Israeli officials apparently believe that such provocations - the breaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that view mistakes the feelings of George Bush , and of most Americans . <p> It is in America 's moral and political interest to sustain the state of Israel . It is not in America 's interest to help Israel inflict moral and political wounds on itself .
