David Turner was under siege last week . A junior at Brandeis University in Waltham , Massachusetts , and editor in chief of the weekly Justice , the student newspaper , he had become a pariah on campus . His phone rang around the clock with irate calls from students and alumni denouncing him as a " monster " and an " anti-Semite . " His car was defaced and he was threatened with bodily harm . Some 2,000 copies of Justice were stolen and presumably destroyed , and when the issue was reprinted , 200 students rallied in protest and a guard had to be assigned to ensure the paper 's safe distribution . <P> The turmoil was prompted by an advertisement in Justice that attacked the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington as a " false and manipulative " representation ; as well , it questioned whether the Nazi gas chambers ever existed and whether the genocide of European Jews ever really occurred . The outcry on the largely Jewish Brandeis campus was understandable but somewhat misdirected ; the decision to run the ad had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor in chief has no vote . <P> Brandeis was not alone . Although campus newspapers at such schools as Harvard , Yale , Berkeley and Wisconsin have rejected Holocaust-denial ads and commentaries , they appeared this fall in student publications at Northwestern , the University of Michigan , Notre Dame and Georgetown , among others . Everywhere , they provoked angry letters to the editors and heated campus debates . <P> These ads  --  and others that have appeared in the collegiate press since the 1991-92 school year  --  were placed by the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust , which is headed by Bradley R. Smith , 63 , a Visalia , California , pamphleteer . Smith , who spends most of his waking hours in Holocaust denial , wants open debate , he says , because the possibility that the Holocaust was a hoax goes unreported . Much of the material on which Smith bases his claims comes from the pseudointellectual journal of the Institute for Historical Review , a Holocaust-denial group in Costa Mesa , California , and the writings of Mark Weber , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I think that journalists feel their career is threatened if they treat revisionist research in an objective way . " <P> Why do college editors and advertising staffs publish Smith 's writings ? " Hiding the ideas of Holocaust revisionists wo n't make them go away , " says Josh Dubow , editor in chief of the University of Michigan 's Daily . " The best way to make them go away is to bring them out in the open and explain why they 're wrong . " That , he says , was why the Daily , in publishing a letter from Smith this fall , accompanied it with an explanation , as well as an editorial and an op-ed piece disputing Smith 's arguments . While publication of the letter stirred anger on the Michigan campus , it was muted compared with the reaction in 1991 when the Daily published a full-page Smith ad and the next day , in an editorial , naively supported its decision on First Amendment grounds . While that amendment guarantees Smith the right to disseminate his views , it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
