The sirens sounded closer and closer . Suddenly , cars pulled up on both sides of the street , blocking other cars from pulling in or out.Then another car pulled up and the door opened . Tiger Woods stepped out of the car and flashed his famous smile . He walked up to the Planet Hollywood restaurant and went inside . I could not believe Tiger Woods just walked by me ! I followed the crowd in right after Tiger . I saw my cousin , Alexander , walk up to Tiger and meet him and get a few pictures . I was still stunned that the man who had once won the Masters and many other tournaments was just a table away from me . I ate breakfast and then went to his table to meet him . An auction started just moments later and there were many interesting things to bid on , such as Tiger 's golf bag . After the bidding was finished , people formed a line to meet Tiger . I got to shake hands with him and he autographed my shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you flip the pages . We left shortly after that to go to a press conference . At the press conference , he was given many awards , and at the end people asked him questions . Photograph Alexander Durham , 14 , left , and Peter SerVaas , tO , middle , fufill the dream of a lifetime by meeting pro golf player Tiger Woods . " It 's never too early to start playing " Tiger says . He was swinging a golf club with Bob Hope when he was only two years old ! // I had to wait two hours until the next activity , but it was well worth it . Next , Tiger showed everyone his talent and tricks . For one trick , he bounced a ball on the face of a club and then popped the ball up and hit it like a baseball . I was amazed . He did it five times in a row and never made a mistake ! He also gave pointers , such as never hitting a ball with your full power , because then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed us some warmups to do before you play or practice golf . I definitely learned how to make my own golf game better . Overall , my favorite part was meeting Tiger at Planet Hollywood , which is something I will surely never forget . When I look back on this day , I 'll remember meeting a great guy who is one of the world 's best golfers .
