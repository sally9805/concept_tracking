ROSS PEROT PITCHES HIMSELF AS A MAN OF THE PEOPLE , WITH the people helping him , in true grass-roots fashion , to get on the ballot . But as Perot gathers strength , the little people are finding themselves pushed out by local bigwigs . In Virginia a Perot backer says he was ousted , partly over his desire to include more blacks in the campaign . One Oklahoma activist , wary of losing control to local heavies , says he 's keeping 35,000 petition signatures in a bank vault until he delivers them to state election officials . The Perot campaign insists that it is not trampling the grass . " Democracy , after all , is an unruly process , " says Perot spokesman James Squires . Big changes are afoot within Perot 's inner circle too . Hamilton Jordan , campaign manager and chief of staff for Jimmy Carter , has decided to join the campaign , as has former Reagan adviser Ed Rollins . They 're just the kind of political pros Perot has been seeking .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
