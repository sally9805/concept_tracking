THE SIMPSON CASE Both sides followed their game plans , the lawyer accusing , O.J. denying . Good drama , but will it change any minds ? <p> THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM LAST week was that there would n't be a Perry Mason moment . There would n't be a time when O. J. Simpson would suddenly break down on the stand or make a mistake so bad as to be decisive . For once the analysts were right ; that momentous occurrence did n't happen . Yet as the day anticipated by millions was drawing to an end , plaintiffs ' lawyer Daniel Petrocelli approached Simpson and began a series of questions that stilled the courtroom : You used the Bronco to go to Nicole Brown 's condominium that evening . . . You had gloves . You had a hat . You were wearing a dark sweat outfit . And you had a knife ? ' Simpson , hesitating ever so slightly , answered : That 's absolutely not true . ' You confronted Nicole Brown Simpson and you killed her , did n't you ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson replied , now turning his body to face the jury . And you killed Ronald Goldman , sir , did you or did you not ? ' Petrocelli demanded . That is absolutely not true , ' Simpson repeated . And as Petrocelli coursed through the familiar events , Simpson repeated the denial to each question , his voice faltering at times and his breathing sometimes labored . <p> When the criminal-trial jury came back with its not-guilty verdict just over a year ago , the nation stood still and watched . It 's a safe bet to say that , well , a big chunk of the nation would have stood still last Friday  --  were it not that a judge named Hiroshi Fujisaki dislikes cameras in the courtroom . In this most overexposed case of the century , the only thing missing had been Simpson himself on the witness stand . Sure , the obsessed could have caught his $29.95 video or watched a TV interview he 's given or even read his civil-trial deposition on the Internet . But Simpson took a constitutional bye on testifying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civil case , so last week , and continuing this week , marked the first time he had to answer questions publicly , under oath , from an adversarial lawyer  --  and before a jury . <p> How did he do ? On the positive side for the defense , a gray-suited Simpson solidly stuck by the story he had told in his 10-day-long deposition earlier this year . Petrocelli was hard pressed to find many significant inconsistencies or even get Simpson to express any doubt . He did n't really bruise Simpson 's charisma . Indeed , Simpson 's demeanor , nervous at first , seemed to hit the right pitch  --  polite and deferential , showing frustration at appropriate moments and expressing heartfelt sentiments toward Nicole at others . This is a woman I love today , ' he said , while denying any battering . I have always loved her . ' <p> But the performance was n't flawless . He swore he never ' hit , struck or slapped his ex-wife  --  yet jurors viewed photographs of a bruised Nicole on a giant courtroom television . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying it was she who struck him during a fight . He branded her a liar for telling others he had hit her . By the end of the day , Simpson had accused just about everyone he knows , from Nicole to his golfing buddies to loyal secretary Cathy Randa , of lying . Inexplicably , he even refused to accept as true a telephone record showing that he had retrieved a Dear John ' message from his then girlfriend Paula Barbieri on the night of the murders . <p> The denials did n't make for an appealing picture , and that seemed to be what Petrocelli , through his relentless burrowing , knew he had to achieve . He wanted Simpson to build a self-portrait of a man who not only seemed full of rage but also seemed to find everyone a liar but himself . And he hoped the jury would find those cascading denials so implausible that O.J. 's credibility would be destroyed in the ultimate denial : that he did n't kill Nicole and Goldman . Because he could n't alter the account he gave in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner , ' said Stan Goldman , a Loyola Law School professor . <p> It was impossible , of course , to tell if the jury saw it that way . They seemed riveted ; some seemed more interested in taking copious notes than watching the former football star . Not so family members of the victims , who stared hard . The Goldmans and Browns sat behind their lawyers , close to the jury box . The courtroom , arranged much like Judge Lance Ito 's , was packed with reporters and spec- tators ; it had the same charged at-mosphere that was present the day Simpson was found not guilty . <p> In the morning session , Petrocelli quickly turned to the questions of domestic abuse . Simpson conceded a troubled relationship with Nicole  --  heated arguments , thrown pictures , broken lamps  --  and one physical altercation , the New Year 's 1989 fight . Simpson had pleaded no contest in that fight . Petrocelli went through the enlarged photos and asked how she got the welts and scrapes . I do n't know , ' Simpson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' with her to push her out of the bedroom . <p> How many times in the course of these physical altercations did you hit Nicole ? ' Petrocelli asked later . <p> Never , ' he said . <p> How many times did you slap Nicole ? ' <p> Never . ' <p> Then in a rising voice Petrocelli asked , How many times did you beat her , sir ? ' <p> Never , ' Simpson declared . He even suggested the facial marks were caused by her habit of picking at her blemishes . <p> Keeping Simpson under a tight rein , Petrocelli took him quickly through other tumultuous and apparently violent points in his relationship with Nicole . The list included a half-dozen incidents , including one when Simpson allegedly slapped Nicole on a beach . But Simpson flatly denied they had occurred . Turning to the October 1993 incident at Nicole 's home in which Simpson kicked in the door , Petrocelli read from a police tape of the interview : When he gets this crazed I get scared . . . He gets a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes get black . ' Simpson insisted that if she were really frightened , she would never have left her bedroom to talk to him . When asked about looking animal ' ' - like , he responded : I can never recall being mad and looking in a mirror . ' <p> Petrocelli read entries from Nicole 's journal that detailed the deteriorating relationship in the last days of her life . In one passage Nicole wrote of an expletive-filled outburst by Simpson . Enraged that she had hung up on him , he allegedly called her a bitch ' and threatened to make sure she did n't have a f  --  king dime left . ' Simpson denied the entire exchange . <p> Everything in these diary entries is true except where Nicole reports what you said to her ? ' Petrocelli asked incredulously . Yes , ' Simpson responded . All that was a pack of lies ? ' Yes , ' said Simpson . <p> The two men also sparred over the final months of the relationship between Nicole and Simpson . Petrocelli tried to show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating , in the plaintiffs ' theory , an enraged and obsessed Simpson poised to murder . Petrocelli asked about Kato Kaelin 's testimony last week that seemed to depict Simpson as upset over his former wife 's love life . Kaelin testified that the day before the murders he and Simpson were watching the video of The World According to Garp ' when O.J. said a scene reminded him of an incident in 1993  --  when he had peered into the window of Nicole 's house and watched his ex-wife have oral sex with her boyfriend on the sofa . <p> Simpson asserted that he would not have told Kato about that sexual incident with Nicole . And he said it was Nicole who incessantly ' pursued him , sending him cookies and cakes . I did n't want to deal with any of her problems , ' he said , insisting he had ended the relationship . <p> Simpson tried a bit of humor in the afternoon session . Asked about the request to Kato for change of $100 the night of the murders , Simpson explained that Kato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note . If he had had $87 I would have given him the bill , but I was n't going to give him $100 for $73 , ' Simpson said . Spectators laughed . But later , after Simpson joked that he was not dating ' Kato , Petrocelli asked if he thought the proceeding was funny . No , I do n't think any of this is funny , ' he replied . I wish I were anywhere but here . ' <p> It was taken as gospel that Simpson 's testimony would be crucial to the outcome of the case . A credible performance might allow jurors to dismiss the physical evidence ; a poor one would only feed into it . But given the tenor of the case so far , it was especially critical for Simpson to impress the jurors . Fujisaki has issued a series of pro-plaintiff rulings that largely block Simpson 's lawyers from offering theories of police conspiracies or planted evidence  --  theories that served his side so well in the criminal trial . Just last week Fujisaki also barred the jury from hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his testimony in the criminal trial . So Furhman will not be taking the stand . <p> The plaintiffs also seemed to be avoiding the mistake of their predecessors : putting on lengthy and rambling testimony . And they 've added a few elements that the criminal-trial jurors never heard . They presented last week a photograph of Simpson , broadcasting at a 1993 football game , wearing the Bruno Magli shoes that the plaintiffs contend he wore the night of the murders . The defense says the photo is a phony . <p> Meanwhile , in an Orange County juvenile court a kind of parallel battle is being waged . Simpson is fighting to regain custody of his two children from Nicole Brown 's parents , who are using the same allegations of domestic violence as their claim to keep the kids . NEWSWEEK has learned that in the weeks before taking the stand in the civil trial , Simpson sat through about a dozen witnesses ' testifying about past incidences of alleged abuse for the custody case . And two weeks ago , Simpson took the stand himself  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He denied everything , ' a source told NEWSWEEK . He 's sticking closely to the script . ' <p> Whether that script has just the right lines and weight for the civil trial remains to be seen . The defense has n't even begun its case yet and hopes to rip into what the jury has heard thus far . As for the public , O.J. 's day in court has come at last . Will it change any minds ? Not likely . A Tale of Two Trials <p> The civil case against Simpson generally follows the terrain of the criminal trial . Yet from the judge to new evidence , the case has turned up important distinctions  --  and the defense has n't even begun . The judges CIVIL TRIAL <p> No-nonsense Judge Fujisaki keeps testimony clicking with few sidebar interruptions . He quickly ruled out speculative defense attacks and barred cameras . CRIMINAL TRIAL <p> A star-struck Lance Ito ran a loose ship . The lawyers rambled , and the case dragged on far too long . He gave the defense great latitude . Bruno Magill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo of Simpson wearing the shoes at a football game , and an FBI agent testified the shoes matched the footprints found at the crime scene . CRIMINAL TRIAL <p> Jurors heard about the size-12 shoes last time , and the footprints left behind in the blood . But no link was made directly to Simpson Brian ( Kato ) Kaelin CIVIL TRIAL <p> Kato hurt O.J. , testifying that the three notorious thumps sounded like a person falling behind his wall . And he said O.J. was upset about Nicole and an ex-lover . CRIMINAL TRIAL <p> Fumbling , nervous , childlike , Kaelin last time gave testimony that was so weak against O.J. that prosecutors turned him into a hostile witness . Mark Fuhrman CIVIL TRIAL <p> This time it 's Mark Who ? While the defense has raised his name , he wo n't be testifying . The judge barred any mention of his guilty plea to perjury . CRIMINAL TRIAL <p> The defense rested its theory of racist cops and planted evidence on this former LAPD detective who found the bloody glove behind O.J. 's Rockingham house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Werner Spitz , a pathologist , asserted that some of the cuts were fingernail gouges mused by either of the victims fending off the attacker . CRIMINAL TRIAL <p> Simpson 's mysterious cuts were said to be from a cell phone , from a broken glass or , as the prosecution argued , inflicted during the murder struggle . The gloves CIVIL TRIAL <p> A plaintiffs ' expert testified that the famous gloves have shrunk , and they do fit Simpson . And jurors only saw a tape of O.J. trying on the gloves , not a live demo . CRIMINAL TRIAL <p> " If they do n't fit you must acquit , " went the winning mantra , deflecting prosecution attempts to show that Nicole had bought the gloves for O.J. <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The focus of attention : With lawyer Dan Leonard , the defendant heads for his first day on the witness stand <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : No retreat : During a break , Simpson was as jaunty as ever <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Judge Fujisaki <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Brian ( Kato ) Kaelin <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Mark Furman <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Cuts on hand <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The gloves <p> BY DONNA FOOTE AND LARRY REIBSTEIN <p>
