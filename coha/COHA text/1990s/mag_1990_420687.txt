Sears Chairman Ed Brennan could learn a great deal from what his younger brother Bernie has done at Montgomery Ward . <p> IT IS HARD to imagine two people more different than Edward Brennan and his younger brother Bernard . Edward , 56 , chairman of $54 billion ( revenues ) Sears , Roebuck &; Co. , is every inch the professional manager . Educated at Marquette University , Ed Brennan is a smooth and competent corporate chieftain who was marked for the chairman 's office at an early age . <p> Fifty-two-year-old Bernie Brennan , on the other hand , has a rough-hewn prizefighter 's face . He is regarded as introspective , driven and intense . With a degree in business administration from the College of St. Thomas , in St. Paul , Minn. , Bernie labored for years in his older brother 's shadow . The company he leads , $5 billion ( revenues ) Montgomery Ward , is much smaller than Sears , but it is also doing much better . While Sears is still struggling to upgrade its image , Montgomery Ward has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pioneer in mass merchandising through specialty stores . And while Edward Brennan is a corporate employee who earned $2.5 million last year , Bernie recently completed one of the largest management-led leveraged buyouts in history and became fabulously wealthy . <p> Until 1976 both brothers were working their way up at Sears , where their father and grandfather had been buyers . Edward , as general manager of the Boston group of stores , was the golden boy . Bernie was stuck as assistant national manager for furniture sales . " Sears is a wonderful company , " Bernie Brennan recalls , " but it just became stifling . " <p> So he quit . In 1976 he joined a former Sears colleague , G. Bruce Douglas , who was running Sav-A-Stop , a smallish retailer of health and beauty aids and housewares , then based in jacksonville , Fla . Douglas named Bernie Brennan head of Sav-A-Stop 's distribution division . For Douglas , it was a big mistake . <p> Brennan quickly made himself indispensable by cutting costs and increasing sales . In 1978 , two years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Douglas and the board to make him president and chief operating officer . Five months later Brennan , then 40 , was back with another demand : Douglas ' job . Again , the board agreed . Douglas was out . <p> Only later could Douglas objectively assess how it all happened . " I had given him Brennan control over the distribution company , " relates Douglas . " He did a very effective job , and developed the loyalty of its executives . When we finally spun off all the retail operations  --  and he was very involved in that  --  we were left with the distribution company , effectively his division . His point to the board was : I really am the CEO of this company , and unless we 're going into other businesses , we do n't need two CEOS . His approach was n't particularly subtle . " <p> As head of Say-A-Stop , Brennan was approached by another brash young man on the rise : Henry Kravis , who wanted him to participate in a leveraged buyout of Sav-A-Stop . But Brennan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a lot of debt ; he declined Kravis ' overtures . <p> In 1982 Sav-A-Stop was bought by Consolidated Foods for $72 million , and Brennan left to become head of store operations at Mobil Oil Corp . ' s ailing Montgomery Ward chain , based in Chicago . Brennan was recruited to the job in 1982 by Ward 's tough chief executive at the time , Stephen Pistner . Pistner had been attacking Ward 's overhead with gusto . Between 1980 and 1985 he cut 30,000 jobs and sacked over half of management . Ward , which had lost $415 million since 1980 , slowly limped back to profitability ; by 1983 even retail was showing a small profit . <p> Brennan soon made his mark as Pistner 's tough second-in-command . But again he felt that his stage was too small for both himself and anyone with better billing . He and Pistner began to quarrel . Within 13 months of his arrival at Ward , it was announced that Brennan was leaving . <p> From Ward , Brennan 's path led , briefly , to Household Merchandising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Household International Corp . and owner of Von 's Supermarkets and other retailing chains . But he hardly had a chance to settle in when Household began to consider spinning off its retailing arm in a leveraged buyout that would not include Brennan . <p> At this juncture  --  in the spring of 1985  --  Brennan heard that his old rival , Stephen Pistner , had left Montgomery Ward and that Mobil was interested in having Brennan back , this time as chief executive . " The timing , " remembers Brennan " was very appropriate . " <p> Brennan found Ward in worse shape than when he had left it 18 months before , but with a signal difference : Mobil had retained Goldman , Sachs in hopes of selling Montgomery Ward . But who would buy it ? Hard hit by discount chains such as Wal-Mart and Kmart on the one hand and specialty retailers such as Circuit City , the Gap and the Limited on the other , Ward 's merchandising operations were losing about $75 million a year . Only the credit card operation was generating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion for Ward and a sister company and invested $609 million more , had garnered a bid of only $300 million for Ward in 1983 ; few expected that it could get significantly more in 1985 . <p> Mobil gave Brennan three years to make the retailer " financially independent " ( read " good enough to sell " ) . <p> Brennan did the job in half that time . Brennan picked up more or less where he 'd left off with Pistner . He cut costs and eliminated unprofitable lines of business . And he worked to develop Montgomery Ward into a chain of discount specialty stores selling brand-name goods . In everything he did , the emphasis was on rapid implementation . <p> " There are strategies lying all over corporate boardrooms that never get implemented , " explains Brennan . " A turnaround requires good input , but once you make the decision , it requires absolute commitment to implementation . " <p> He cites an example : " When I first came back , I gave what I felt was an impassioned speech to 300 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back door of the meeting room , I heard a guy say : This too shall pass . ' I went back to the front of the room , and got up and repeated what I had just heard , and I said : Not this time . If you think it 's going to be the same old way , it ai n't . ' <p> " The guy I 'd overheard was a bureaucrat , " Brennan continues . " In a turnaround you have to make substantial decisions quickly , so people know you are serious about what you 're doing . If you have n't demonstrated your willingness to make great changes quickly , you 're perceived to be just another bureaucrat who 's come in to run the business . " <p> To tackle the organization 's bureaucracy , Brennan formed an executive committee of seven trusted colleagues , brought them into Ward 's old boardroom and began a series of strategy sessions that lasted throughout the summer : 18-hour days spent reviewing the viability of the company , business by business , segment by segment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning at Ward : " Bernie is a hard-driving manager . No detail is too small to examine . He does n't hesitate to call a meeting at 6 , does n't hesitate to keep you there till 11 at night without dinner , does n't hesitate to have an all-day Saturday meeting . " <p> But as he drove his people , Brennan also held out the promise of great rewards if they won . " I told them we are going to run this company as if we own it , and if we do it well enough , we will have a chance to own it . " <p> By the autumn of 1985 Brennan had decided to amputate businesses accounting for a third of Montgomery Ward 's sales revenues . Gone were the catalog business , the company 's foundation stone ; the Jefferson Ward discount chain ; dozens of unprofitable department stores and merchandise lines . Brennan had slashed 20% of Ward 's work force ( 17,000 people ) and 35% of its corporate staff . <p> To begin growing again , Ward announced that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format . This meant that Ward 's retailing would be focused on a few specialty stores ' Electric Avenue , Auto Express , Home Ideas , the Apparel Store and Gold N ' Gems , each run as an autonomous business . This was Brennan 's way of keeping the hacked-back bureaucracy from spreading again . <p> " I wanted our electronics and appliance store Electric Avenue to be better than Circuit City , " Brennan explains . " I wanted our auto appliance store Auto Express to be better than Pep Boys . I had a role model for each store . I said , Do n't worry about Sears and J.C . Penney and the general merchants ; let 's focus on the retailers who are driving the market : the Limited , the Gap , those kinds of people . ' " <p> Where space was being underutilized by Ward 's stores , Brennan leased space to noncompeting retailers like Toys " R " Us . They paid rent and brought new customers to the mall . <p> Consumers found the new look excitingly unusual for an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years . And because of the rigorous cost-cutting of 1985 , operating expenses went down 6 percentage points , to 23% of revenues ; Ward had left Sears ( at 29% ) in the dust and was moving in on Wal-Mart ( at 16% ) . Net income rose from $53 million ( mostly from credit card operations ) on sales of $5.5 billion in 1985 to a record $151 million ( without credit card operations ) on sales of $5 billion in 1989 . <p> Brennan 's promise that management would get a chance to cash in on its hard work was made good in late 1987 , when Mobil announced that Montgomery Ward was for sale . All the serious buyout players showed up for the auction . The merchant banking divisions of First Boston , Shearson Lehman and Merrill Lynch were there . So were the LBO boutiques Gibbons , Green , van Amerongen ; Forstmann Little ; Wesray Capital ; and , of course , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts . <p> But the key player turned out to be Bernard Brennan , who had effectively made himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along : a 50% equity stake for management and no junk bonds in the financing . <p> The Wall Street crowd groaned , but Brennan held firm . " I was n't interested in doing a deal that made some investment banking firm rich with fees and left the company strapped financially , " he explains . " I recognized that we had to grow and open stores ; we had to be able to compete . I mean , if you leverage yourself the way many retailers did and then go out and compete with Wal-Mart and folks who have tremendous capital structures , you ca n't survive . My position was : If the deal ca n't be structured right , I do n't want to do it . " <p> The bidders soon lost interest . But Brennan did find a partner  --  Kidder , Peabody , then 80% owned by General Electric Financial Services  --  that promised to meet his conditions . But at the last moment , Brennan says , another GE subsidiary , GE Capital , decided that it was n't happy with management 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleventh hour , Brennan called General Electric Chairman Jack Welch . <p> " I told him : We had a deal and I expect you to stay with it , ' " says Brennan , who describes the call to Welch as " an emotional conversation . " Within 48 hours Welch had Brennan 's original deal back on track . <p> The final result looked like this : Mobil received $3.8 billion for Montgomery Ward , composed of $1.6 billion in cash and assumption of $2.2 billion in debt . Of that , GE Capital paid $2.7 billion in cash and debt assumption for Montgomery Ward 's credit card operation . <p> That left Montgomery Ward 's merchandising operations , with revenues of over $5 billion . These were purchased by the Brennan group and GE Capital for $1.1 billion  --  new equity of $100 million and $1 billion in debt . Brennan and 42 other senior executives put up $5 million cash to buy management 's half of the company ; 15% of those shares automatically went into a stock ownership fund for 1,500 middle managers . Management has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a debt-to-equity ratio of 10-to-1 , Montgomery Ward was certainly a highly leveraged transaction . Still , Ward ended up with a lower absolute level of debt  --  and of debt service costs  --  than before the buyout . <p> Brennan himself put up about $3 million in cash for 27%  --  and effective control  --  of Montgomery Ward . Valuing the company at 5.5 times its estimated 1990 cash flow of $370 million ( minus debt ) , FORBES estimates the current value of that stake at around $350 million . Brennan believes that he can increase the company 's value substantially as he pushes for greater decentralization of management . <p> " In a restructuring mode , you tend to have fewer people making all the decisions , " says Brennan . " As you move from that into a growth mode , you require people who are more entrepreneurial , more creative and who have a penchant to grow the business as well as know how to operate it . " <p> Brennan adds : " The retail business is tougher today than it 's been in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get better for a while . " But Montgomery Ward seems to be bucking the tide . For the first nine months of 1990 , net earnings were up to $61 million on revenues of $3.6 billion . And the holiday season is yet to come . <p> More important , cash flow from operations continues at a high rate of around $370 million a year ; this enables Brennan not only to meet Montgomery Ward 's net interest expense , $59 million in 1989 , but also to pay down debt , down $200 million from two years ago . He also paid Mobil $180 million for an old tax liability in 1989 . And he is left with ample financial resources to expand , while many of his competitors  --  from Federated to Sears  --  are cutting back or restructuring . Brennan will open 17 new stores this year and plans to open 20 in 1991 . ( Ward currently has 343 stores . ) The remodeling of the old stores is continuing . <p> At Sears , meanwhile , continuing soft sales and high costs have forced Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and assume personal responsibility for merchandising in the hope of finally engineering a turnaround . <p> Will Ed Brennan learn from little brother Bernie 's victories at Ward ? Perhaps he is already learning . In August Sears and Montgomery Ward announced that they were breaking off talks with each other . What they were talking about  --  merger ? asset sales ? an exchange of chairmen ?  --  was never disclosed . But Bernie Brennan surely had the upper hand over his older brother Ed . The final chapter of this saga has yet to be written . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Edward Brennan ( above ) and Bernard Brennan ( left ) broke off talks in August Ward had left Sears in the dust and was moving in on Wal-Mart . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Montgomery Ward yesterday and today " In a turnaround ... once you make the decision , it requires absolute commitment to implementation .
