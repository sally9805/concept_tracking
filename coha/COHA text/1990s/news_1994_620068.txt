<p> With the fateful hour of the long-delayed BART strike near , transit agencies and commuters across the Bay Area are laying plans to cope with what is sure to be a traffic nightmare this week . <p> Weekend negotiations went into recess at 4:30 p.m. yesterday and were scheduled to resume this morning at 11 . <p> If the two sides are unable to reach agreement by midnight tomorrow night , the unions ' walkout will begin and more than 255,000 daily BART riders will have to find some other way to get to work , or just to get around , starting Wednesday . Between boats , vans , buses , carpools and even telecommuting , there is no shortage of alternatives . <p> The trouble is that those alternatives will not come close to picking up the slack , employers and transit officials warn . So expect chaos , and build plenty of extra time into your trip , wherever you are going . <p> Just how much extra time that will have to be is anybody 's guess . The last time BART went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were about 100,000 fewer daily riders , and the freeways were much less congested . <p> " It was a total disaster then , and now would be much worse , " said BART spokesman Mike Healy . News reports at the time spoke of gridlocked freeways , commutes lengthened by more than an hour across the Bay Bridge , and frayed nerves everywhere . <p> " Devastating is the word to use for the effect of a strike , " Oakland Chamber of Commerce President Mary Warren said last week at a planning session of East Bay transit managers and employers . " If you ca n't get people to work , ca n't move them from point to point , then it 's critical . There 's just no nice way to put it . " <p> Many employers whose workers use BART say that no matter what options they create , from ride-sharing to staggered work hours , a strike will not just chew up employee time , but also hurt business . <p> " I do n't even want to get into a number , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in downtown Oakland . " Let 's just say that the longer the situation continues , the worse impact it will have . " <p> BART General Manager Richard White said there is a possibility the system will run a skeleton " lifeline service for those who are transit-dependent , " but the decision to start that service will have to be made by BART 's board of directors . The service would be operated by managers with experience operating trains . BART 's board could call a meeting to vote on the matter at any time . <p> BART Board President Margaret Pryor said any decision to run such a minimal , emergency service would have to take into consideration the possible danger of running trains with operators who do not do it regularly . <p> If there were a mishap or accident of any kind on trains run during a walkout , she said , the public " would jump on us " with blame . " The riding public needs to know that our primary responsibility is safety , " she said . <p> Directors of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transit in the East Bay and the Municipal Railway in San Francisco  --  said they will try their best to pitch in with extra services , but they can not fill the need . <p> " We ca n't replace BART any more than BART can replace us , " said Mike Mills , spokesman for AC Transit , which moves 225,000 riders a day . " There 's no way we can say a strike wo n't be very hurtful to the entire East Bay and to our system as well . " <p> In the event of a walkout , AC Transit is planning new , temporary service on several lines . Additional buses will be run all day connecting North Oakland , downtown Oakland , El Cerrito and southern Alameda County with San Francisco . <p> The Muni , which carries 734,000 passengers daily in San Francisco , will be running extra Mission Street express lines downtown , as well as regular shuttles among the city 's BART stations . <p> The Alameda-Oakland-San Francisco ferry service is also planning extra lines during peak hours , and the RIDES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay Area who want to share rides . <p> Richard Soublet , personnel manager at Clorox in Oakland 's City Center , said his company is considering encouraging the office 's 1,000 workers join van pools , telecommute from home by computer and share rides . <p> " Clearly , it 's going to be very disruptive , since the majority of our employees BART to work , " Soublet said . " We wo n't really know how much until it happens . " <p> Some people are looking on the bright side of a strike . <p> " The strike potential represents a real opportunity to raise awareness about transit alternatives , " said Kathryn Hughes , transit coordinator for the city of Oakland . " This is not the only crisis we will face , between earthquakes , fires , transit strikes , toxic spills and God knows what else . This is a crazy world . <p> " It 's good to know what alternatives are out there , and to encourage people to use them .
