<p> It was 4 o'clock in the morning of May 14 when the shrill buzz of the telephone woke Igor and Evelyn Samoilovich in their Marietta home . <p> Through a sleepy haze , Mr. Samoilovich heard Semen Elkis speaking in Russian : " Igor , I killed Julia and her mother . " <p> " How long do you think it will take the police to come ? " Semen ( pronounced SEE-MON ) wanted to know . <p> Mr. Samoilovich guessed about 15 minutes . <p> " Then you give me 10 more minutes of life , " breathed Semen . " Tell the police not to break the lock in the front door , because I 've left the back door open for them . " <p> When police broke through the front door of the Elkis home in Roswell , they found Semen slumped over the kitchen table with a .38- caliber slug in his chest . His ex-wife and former mother-in-law were upstairs , also dead . <p> In one sense , the Elkis story is the time-honored tale of a family who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two short years built a life on an impressive patch of suburbia . <p> But it 's also the Russian saga of a man devastated by his inability to maintain Old World authority over family members entranced with their New World freedoms . His wife wanted a divorce . One son no longer obeyed . The other became a drummer for a band called the Impotent Seasnakes . <p> And then it is the more sordid American tale of a society that could n't stop a husband bent on destroying what he could no longer control . <p> Friends , co-workers , social workers , lawyers and his wife knew that Semen had said he wanted to kill himself and her . But no one could keep him from buying a gun , force him into psychiatric care , or offer his wife the long-term protection she needed . <p> ' Love at first sight ' <p> Julia was an effervescent engineering student in Moscow when Semen met her at a Moscow tram stop . The two were married a few weeks later , on Dec. 15 , 1970 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled 23 years later at their divorce hearing . <p> She was 21 , he was 37 . He was divorced , Jewish , chief of the publicity section at a Soviet agricultural ministry . She was half-Jewish , half-Orthodox Christian . Her father , a famous cellist , had endured Stalin 's prison camps . <p> By Soviet standards , they enjoyed the good life . Two sons - Dmitry , or " Dima , " and Boris - were born in 1971 and 1973 . In 1973 , Semen bought his family a two-bedroom apartment . <p> Semen was content , but Julia later testified that she stopped loving Semen when their children were still small . " It was pretty common in Russia to live with a person you do n't love , because there 's no place to go . You ca n't support yourself financially , " she said . <p> The sons remember a sympathetic mother and a distant , demanding father . <p> " We all need the person who you know will never let you down , and she was the only person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 19 , a composer and drummer . <p> Dima , 21 , said Semen expected instant obedience . <p> " I 'm telling you one time , bring me my slippers . I 'm telling you one time , not a second time , " his father would tell him . <p> " You know how Louis XIV said , ' The state , it 's me ? ' Well , for Semen , the family was him , " said Phillip Britton , an Atlanta friend . <p> Things did not improve when Julia 's mother , Lidia Crane , moved in with the family in the 1970s . Semen and Mrs. Crane fought about money , and eventually she moved out . <p> " My wife 's mother had the same feelings toward me approximately as Saddam Hussein does toward Bush , " Semen said at the hearing . <p> Help from Russian friends <p> In 1978 , the Soviet Union eased restrictions on Jewish emigration , allowing a record 12,265 to leave for the United States . The Elkises ' friends Igor and Evelyn Samoilovich moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Elkises would be joining them in Atlanta . But at the last minute , the Soviet government denied Semen a visa . <p> The Elkises renewed their emigration attempts in 1990 . <p> This time , their visas were granted so swiftly that they barely had time to prepare . In Atlanta , Mr. and Mrs. Samoilovich paid the $ 1,800 necessary to finance the Elkises ' resettlement by Jewish Family Services , a refugee agency . <p> On Dec. 18 , 1990 , Semen , Julia and the boys landed at Hartsfield International Airport , where the Samoiloviches were waiting . <p> A drop in status <p> The Elkises moved into an apartment on Holcomb Bridge Road , not far from the Samoilovich home in Marietta . Their first big purchase was a $ 1,000 wide-screen color television . Julia and the boys watched continually to learn English . <p> Julia found a job at a McDonald 's , Dima started work as a hotel cleaner , and Boris enrolled at Riverwood High School . <p> From the start , Semen had trouble adjusting . <p> He declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes . Then a routine checkup led to a quadruple heart bypass at St. Joseph 's Hospital . Still weak and complaining of pain , he started a job washing dishes at Ippolito 's Family Style Italian Restaurant in Roswell . <p> The pay was $ 6 an hour . The drop in status was a shock , and a source of shame . He wrote friends in Russia that he was the manager of a big restaurant . <p> At Ippolito 's , Semen sang Italian operas with Bruno Arundelli , a dough-maker who had immigrated from Italy 16 years earlier . Semen often brought his co-workers old photographs of himself wearing suits back in Moscow to show how important he had once been . <p> The situation deteriorated at home . Semen quarreled with Mr. Samoilovich . Worried that Dima might never escape menial labor and go to college , Semen nagged his son to the point that the two rarely spoke . <p> Soon Boris dropped out of high school . Compared with the special music school he had attended in Moscow , Riverwood seemed bureaucratic and impersonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' roll drag band , Boris spent much of the next year on tour . <p> In 1991 , Semen received the first of three $ 5,000 installments from the sale of the Elkises ' Moscow apartment . Semen , Julia and Dima put a down payment on an $ 88,200 house on West Crossville Road in Roswell . <p> They later discovered the state Department of Transportation had paid the previous owner $ 48,000 to expand the road into their front yard . <p> But they adored the Colonial with four bedrooms and big white columns . " To my family , the house was the symbol of being secure , " Boris said . " They wanted to have a place that they could feel comfortable for the rest of their lives . " <p> Making the $ 870 monthly payments was a strain , though all three contributed . <p> By this time , Julia was making $ 8.90 an hour decorating cakes at a Kroger in Dunwoody . Still hoping to return to engineering , she took a nine-month course in the computer drafting program used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor . <p> Semen resented her growing independence . <p> " His temper was getting worse and worse , because he does n't speak English , because he works this job , " Julia later testifed . " He did n't see any future for himself . " <p> " So he tried , you know , kind of to control me . " She said he eavesdropped on her telephone calls and tried to tell her what to do with her time and her money . <p> She decided to get a divorce . <p> One word summed up Semen 's attitude toward the divorce , his attorney , Jeff Hamling , later said : " Nyet - no ! " <p> Shortly before Julia filed for divorce in December 1992 , Semen appeared at the Samoilovich house with a bottle of vodka , some sandwiches and pickles and two glasses . " I 'm gon na die , and I 'm going to take my wife 's life with me , " Semen announced . <p> " She gets the divorce , I 'm going to kill me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture of broken English and pantomine . <p> In January , Julia told her lawyer , Fred Stokes , that she was afraid Semen had bought a gun to kill her . " Has he threatened you ? " Mr. Stokes remembers asking her . " Has he hit you ? " <p> Julia said he had not . <p> " Then I do n't know what you can do , " Mr. Stokes told his client . " It 's just not a problem with owning a gun , because lots of people own guns here . " <p> Semen told a social worker at Jewish Family Services about his scheme . But Julia did not respond to a registered letter of warning from the social worker . <p> " She wanted everything very quiet , very polite , " said Mrs. Samoilovich . " She did n't want her sons to see her calling the police against their father . " <p> Ordered out of the house <p> On March 24 , 1992 , Julia and Dima testified in Fulton County Superior Court that they could no longer live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother would be arriving from Russia on March 29 . <p> Julia told Judge Rowland W. Barnes that her husband had threatened to shoot himself and " somebody else . " She volunteered to give him the car , pay him a one-third share of the house and help him find an apartment . <p> When Semen took the stand , he produced a 100-page , handwritten speech in Russian and a family photo album . He accused his family of abandoning him " like a sick dog that can no longer serve . " <p> Judge Barnes awarded the house to Julia and Dima , ordering Semen to move out by April 24 . But the judge took pains to tell Semen that he could recover from the divorce if he would only learn English . <p> Mr. Hamling turned to his client and realized that not one word had sunk in . " It had no impact , " he recalled . <p> April 24 passed , and Semen refused to leave the house . Julia called her lawyer , who advised her to give him another week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he kept postponing the moving date . He hung up on a social worker who offered to find him free psychiatric help . <p> Julia had always cut his hair , and after the divorce , he let it grow into a shaggy white mane . He had already dropped 74 pounds . " He looked like Mephistopheles , " Mrs. Samoilovich said , referring to the character of the devil in legend and opera . <p> At the restaurant , Semen drew Mr. Arundelli a calendar and circled May 14 . " I 'm going to do it on May 14 , " he confided . He said it was the day his father had died in 1973 . <p> Julia told the Samoiloviches that Semen had finally agreed to move out on May 15 . She planned to celebrate with a party . <p> On May 13 , Semen handed Mr. Arundelli an envelope . " You ca n't open it until tomorrow , " he insisted . " You 'll see then . " <p> ' You got ta move on ' <p> The police were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . <p> Julia , who appeared to have been sleeping in an upstairs bedroom , had been shot twice in the chest . Mrs. Crane was found dead on the floor beside her daughter , shot four times . Police theorize she ran into the room to investigate the gunfire . <p> Overcome with grief and anger , Dima slashed his wrists and stomach the morning after the murders . <p> " Many people , they knew , and nobody did anything , " Dima said a week later . " <p> " I always do the same thing at the end of the day , come home and talk to my mother and watch TV , " he said . " What will I do now ? " <p> Boris , who flew back from New Orleans when he heard the news , maintains his belief in the promise of America . He hopes to break into writing film scores . " The message is that you got more life to live and you got ta move on , " he said . " Learn from the experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Employees and customers at Julia 's Kroger and three other stores are collecting funds to care for the graves of her and her mother . <p> The Samoiloviches have destroyed their photographs of Semen . <p> But one survives . After Mr. Arundelli learned of the deaths , he opened Semen 's envelope . Inside a happy Semen surrounded by colleages looked out of an old picture from the restaurant . <p> " Good by my friends , " he had written on the border .
