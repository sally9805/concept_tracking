At 8 in the morning , the Houston police chief is doing what she does best : preaching the gospel of change . " It 's time to stop treating police officers as automatons , " Elizabeth Watson declares to 40 impassive police sergeants , the middle managers of her department , all but a handful of them men . " None of us want to go back to the control-oriented , negative-discipline sort of time . " There are a few nods as Watson , a forceful speaker , reminds them of the days when the informal police motto was " Nobody ever got fired for doing nothing . " All grist for her message : Watson is committed to the citywide adoption of Neighborhood Oriented Policing , the experimental program that her predecessor and mentor , Lee Brown , championed . " If we continue as we have done in the past , " she says , " we 're doomed . " <P> Thirteen hours later , Watson is co-starring with Mayor Kathryn Whitmire at a community meeting in Acres Homes , a high-crime black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two very different feminist success stories . Dressed in bright colors , the two-term mayor is poised , polished and political . The chief , who in February became the first woman to head a major urban police department , is passionate , very pregnant and plainclothed in a black maternity dress . " The most important job in the police department is not my job , " she says , " but the uniformed officer on the street . And right now , unless he has your help , that officer feels stymied . " <P> A long day by anyone 's standards , and especially for a 41-year-old police chief who is scheduled to give birth to her third child next month . With Ann Richards just elected Governor and Whitmire as mayor , most gender-based expectations have been shattered in Houston . But the extreme novelty of her situation is not lost on Watson . " I find myself wondering if there will ever be another pregnant police chief , " she says . " This may be a one-time deal . Most people who make it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haired . " <P> Stubbornness more than ambition fueled Betsy Watson 's 17-year rise through the ranks  --  an odyssey that carried her from the days when she was expected to sew her own uniform in the police academy to an era in which the chief is inundated with baby showers . Despite her badge , Watson was mostly involuntarily shielded from hazardous duty . Her brief rotation to the SWAT team meant that she worked the radio . Her husband Robert , seemingly content with his own status as a police sergeant , had to coax her into bucking for each promotion . In 1980 , when as a detective she was prematurely transferred out of the burglary division because she was a woman , Watson retaliated by taking the civil-service exam for lieutenant . She says , " I had extreme determination that I would be promoted out of that situation . "
