Lyndon Johnson used to say that a good politician can " make chicken salad out of chicken s . " Judged by that recipe , Bill Clinton is a master  --  at least rhetorically . Consider last Wednesday , when the President dealt with two substantively unrelated issues , one foreign , one domestic . <P> On Bosnia , the President said , " Our nation will not stand idly by in the face of a conflict that offends our consciences . " Sound familiar ? During the 1992 campaign , Clinton said , " History has shown that you ca n't allow the mass extermination of people and just sit idly by and watch it happen . " Between then and now , about all that 's happened is that the number of idle threats has come to rival the death toll . But I really mean it this time , Clinton insists : If the Serbs do n't cease their strangulation of Sarajevo , fire will rain from the air next week  --  more than five months after the very same pledge was first uttered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do finally fly . What exactly will this latest expression of faux muscularity achieve ? " Air power alone " wo n't end the war , says the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . " It 's bombing as therapy , " says Michael Mandelbaum , a Johns Hopkins University foreign policy expert who advised Clinton during the campaign . " Therapy for us , that is ; proof that we 've done something at last  --  even if the Serbs simply move their heavy weapons and strike elsewhere , or hunker down till the dust clears . " Ground troops could settle the conflict , but Clinton has ruled them out . He says he favors lifting the arms embargo so the Bosnians can defend themselves on a level killing field , but he has yet to seriously push his preference . <P> What 's left is the bargaining table , which sounds fine unless the White House 's promise to " encourage " Muslim flexibility only means that the Muslims should roll over and become good victims . Whatever the final resolution  --  if there is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equitable solution . Can anyone doubt that aggression and genocide will ultimately be rewarded ; that Bosnia , if it survives at all , will barely resemble its former self ; and that the " bold tyrants watching to see whether ' ethnic cleansing ' is a policy the world will tolerate " ( to use Secretary of State Warren Christopher 's words ) will have their answer ? What will Clinton the saladmaker do and say then ? He 'll ignore the capitulation , crow that his artful diplomacy produced a negotiated peace and turn anew to the domestic battles that interest him most . <P> That brings us to Clinton 's drug strategy , which he introduced last Wednesday in the same slick way he handled Bosnia . The President portrayed his moves as a grand departure from the drug wars of previous Administrations . Gone , though , is Clinton 's promise to provide addicts with " treatment on demand " and his pledge to spend more money on education and prevention than on law enforcement . If approved by Congress , Clinton 's overall antidrug budget will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubious allocation of $285 million for community policing as a " prevention and treatment " expense , the ratio split will still favor enforcement 59% to 41%  --  down only $ slightly from George Bush 's emphasis , which had the ratio at 65% to 35%.
