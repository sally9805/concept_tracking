This is the second lesson in a series on a new learning system called Rapid Skiing Development . Iast month 's goal was to help you feel how correct balancing on your skis involves constant forward and backward adjustments . That 's what lets you stay over your skis ' sweet spot as the terrain changes and to use the skis as they were designed to be used . This month 's lessons focus on side-to-side movements that put your skis on edge , allowing the sidecut of the ski to create a turn . This is truly the key to effective use of modern , skis , especially super-sidecut skis , and the secret of making great carved turns . // GREEN CIRCLE get tipsy to get turny The best way for novice skiers to get a feeling for correct side-to-side movements that put your skis on edge is to do it first with your skis off . Find a very gentle slope away from skier traffic and stand with your boots across the hill , with your left foot downhill of your right . Using your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , tip your boots to the right onto their edges ( Fig. 1 ) . Notice how your weight is on the inside edge of the left ( dov-nill ) foot . This simulates the end of a right turn on skis . Now , with both boots on edge ( still supporting yourself with your poles ) , lift your left foot slightly so that all your weight is transferred to your right foot . Pull your left foot in beside your right foot and tip it toward its little-toe side ( Fig. 2 ) . As you continue to do this , your center of mass will shift to a point between your feet , simulating the transition between turns . Continue tipping your left foot toward its downhill or littletoe side , keeping it slightly lifted ( Fig. 3 ) . Feel how your balance has shifted so that it 's now over your right foot 's inside edge . Move your left boot slightly away from your right boot and set it down ( Fig. 4 ) , still supporting yourself with your poles . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would already be well into the new turn , carving beautifully . Note how little movement was required to get a perfect turn entry . From one set of edges to the other , you 'd have been well balanced side to side , your skis ' edges engaged early in the turn and doing the work of turning . Once you get this exercise , you can heighten the simulation by making baby steps as you tip your boots from side to side , shuffling turns in your boots back and forth across the slope . BLUE SQUARE small movements real carved turns Now it 's time to apply the same movements ) you practiced in the Green Circle seriesbut with skis on . You can benefit from this using any skis , but you 'll really feel the difference if you re using super-sidecut skis . Choose a slope that 's almost flat and , free of congestion . ( If you 're not used to , gliding straight while balanced on one ski , practice first : Pick up one ski and glider slowly on the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall line , weight on both feet , then pick up the left ski ( Fig. 1 ) and tilt it to the little-toe side ( Fig. 2 ) . This action will also put the right ski slightly on edge . If you just ride the right ski , it will turn to the left . The idea is to get just a slight direction change , not a full turn . Photograph // NOVICE TIP // Now , before the ski has turned very far out of the fall line , put your raised left ski back on the snow ( Fig. 3 ) , then pick up the right ski and angle it to its little-toe side . This will put your left ski onto its edge and start a turn to the right ( Fig. 4 ) . Repeat this exercise enough times to get comfortable moving from foot to foot , edge to edge . Then expand the range of the turn , taking it farther out of the fall line . Once you 're com- ; fortable with weight transfer and tipping , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leg and foot before tilting it to the little-toe side-but keep it on the snow . Once both skis stay on the snow and turn together , you 're ready for advanced turns . BLACK DI use all four edges , To become a versatile skier , you need to be able to use all four ski edges at various times in the turn . Unfortunately , when beginners are taught to slow down with a wedge , they get into the habit of using their ski.s ' inside edges exclusively . This limits their progress , because advanced parallel skiing requires the use of all four edges to link turns . To break out of this habit and gain confidence in your ability to use the outside edges , practice traversing on ! the uphill edge of the uphill ski . Be sure to try it in both directions . It should n't take long to get comfortable with this new skill . Now try a fun exercise to further develop your versatility . Start into a turn with your downhill ski raised slightly off the snow ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its littletoe side . This puts your weight on the inside edge of your uphill ski . Photograph // INTERMEDIATE TIP // About the middle of the turn , with both skis pointing down the fall line , put your inside ski back on the snow ( Fig. 2 ) . Then transfer all your weight to that inside ski and lift the outside ski so that you 're totally committed to the uphill ski ( Fig. 3 ) to finish the turn . You 're now riding on the outside ( uphill ) edge of the uphill ski . When you 're ready to start a new turn , use the same movements as in the Green Circle and Blue Square exercises above : Bring the lifted downhill ski in closer to the uphill ski and angle it to the little-toe side ( Fig. 4 ) . That will pull your body down the fall line and tip the weighted uphill ski from its uphill edge to its downhill edge-and start the new turn . Congratulations ! You 've just made a smooth transition from one carved turn to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the big boys With the skills you 've learned so far , you re ready to join the Corduroy Carvers of America . The key to a high speed carved turn is to use the same movements we 've outlined earlier in the proper order . In Figure 1 , which shows the second half of the turn , notice how high the inside ( right ) ski is tilted on edge . This creates high edge angles for both skis . By keeping this uphill ski tipped on its little-toe side , both skis maintain the same edge angle to the snow , which is an important skill for soft snow and crud ( Fig. 2 ) . It 's important here to stay balanced in the middle of the ski , especially if you are using super-sidecut skis . These shorter skis react quickly to forward or backward leverage . For consistent turns , stay centered on the sweet spot . // ADVANCED TIP Photograph // Now just ride it ( Fig. 3 ) . Look at the deep bend in the outside ski . A ski flexed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is creating the turn . From this point it 's easy to make the transition into the next turn by remembering what you practiced in the Black Diamond lesson : Transfer your weight to the uphill edge of the uphill ski , relax the downhill leg-and tilt the downhill foot onto its little-toe side . By relaxing the downhill leg , gravity can start a new turn by pulling the body across the skis and toward the fall line ( Fig. 4 ) . The key is to change edges early , at the very beginning of the turn . This is true edge-to-edge skiing . To make this kind of early edging work , it 's important to keep your skis on the snow. ; Note that the same movements described in the Green Circle section were used to make this radical carved turn . i Photograph // EXPERT TIP Photograph Author Affiliation Diana Rogers is a certified instructor with the Performance Centers at Aspen .
