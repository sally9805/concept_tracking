Hush . Be quiet . Whisper . Walk softly ... take off your shoes . Who 's still in the bathroom ? The water 's running . For God 's sake , do n't flush the toilet ! After two years you should know better than to be so careless . Empty the chamber pots . Shove the beds back out of the way . The church bells are already ringing the half hour . When the workers arrive at 8:30 , there has to be dead silence . // The usual morning ritual in the secret annex . At 6:45 the alarm clock goes off in Hermann and Auguste van Pels 's room , so loud and shrill that it wakes the Franks and Fritz Pfeffer , who sleep one floor below . The sounds that come next are maddeningly familiar . A well-aimed blow from Mrs. van Pels silences the alarm . The floor creaks , softly at first , then louder . Mr. van Pels gets up , creeps down the steep stairs , and , the first in the bathroom , hurries to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom door creak again . Her roommate , Fritz Pfeffer , is next . Anne sighs , relieved , enjoying these few precious moments of solitude . With eyes closed , she listens to the birdsong in the backyard and stretches in her bed . Bed is hardly the word for the narrow sofa she has lengthened by putting a chair at one end . But Anne thinks it 's luxurious . Miep Gies , who brings the Franks their groceries , has told her that others in hiding are sleeping on the floor in tiny windowless sheds or in damp cellars . Dutifully , Anne gets up and opens the blackout curtains . Discipline rules their lives here . She glances at the world outside . The foggy Friday morning promises to turn into a gloriously warm summer day . If she could just , only for a few minutes ... But she must be patient . It wo n't be much longer now . The attempt to assassinate Hitler two weeks ago has revived everyone 's hopes ... Perhaps she can go back to school the fall . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be over in October , that they will be free ... It is already August . August 4 , 1944. // An hour and forty-five minutes is all they have to prepare for another day . An hour and forty-five minutes passes quickly when eight people have to wash up , store their bedding , push the beds aside , and put tables and chairs back where they belong . After work begins at 8:30 in the warehouse below , they ca n't make a sound . It would be easy to give themselves away . The warehouse foreman , Willem van Maaren , is suspicious enough as it is. // Before a light breakfast at nine , they occupy themselves as quietly as possible , reading or studying , sewing or knitting . And they wait . They must be especially careful during this next half hour . Anyone who absolutely has to get up tiptoes across the room like a thief , in stocking feet or soft slippers , and they have to whisper . If someone laughs or pricks a finger and says " ouch ! " everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rattling typewriters , the ringing telephone , and the voices of Miep Gies , Bep Voskuijl , and Johannes Kleiman  --  all friends and helpers of the residents in the secret annex  --  form a backdrop of sound , the danger is diminished somewhat . Eventually Miep will come to pick up the " shopping list . " In fact , Miep will have to settle for whatever she can get them , and every day she gets a little less . But she knows how eagerly the inhabitants of the secret annex await her . Anne barrages Miep with questions , as she does every morning . And Miep , as she does every morning , puts Anne off until later . Only after Miep has sworn to return for a longer visit in the afternoon will Anne let her go back to her office . Otto Frank retires with Peter van Pels to Peter 's tiny room on the top floor . A dictation in English is the lesson plan for today . Peter is having trouble with this irritating language , so Otto spends his mornings helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the floor below , Anne and her sister , Margot , lose themselves in their books . Patience . Patience and discipline  --  those are the things that mercurial Anne has had to learn these last two years . // In the warehouse , on the ground floor , the spice mill is running with its familiar monotonous clatter . Van Maaren has the door onto Prinsengracht wide open to let in the light and warmth of this soft summer day . // Ten-thirty . The two warehouse workers have a lot of work to do before the noon break . Suddenly a group of men appears in the shop , one of them in the uniform of the German security service , the Sicherheitsdienst , or SD . The men are armed . A few words are exchanged , then van Maaren  --  totally astonished  --  points toward the stairs with his thumb . Another worker , Lammert Hartog , stands nervously to one side . The visitors hurry up the stairs to the offices on the second floor . One stays behind to guard the door . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horribly fat , enters the office shared by Miep , Bep , and Mr. Kleiman . Miep does n't even look up ; people often walk into the office unannounced . Only when she hears his harsh command , " Sit still and not a word out of you ! " does she raise her head and find herself staring into the barrel of a pistol . " Do n't move from your seat , " he orders in Dutch . // Gruff voices can be heard through the double folding doors . The SD man and three of the others , all Dutch , have surprised Victor Kugler at his desk in the next room . " Who owns this building ? " the uniformed man bellows at him in German . Kugler , who grew up in Austria , responds in German , " Mr. Piron . We just rent from him . " Stiffly erect in his chair , he quickly gives the address of the Dutchman who has owned the building at 263 Prinsengracht since April 1943. // " Stop playing games with me , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who 's the boss here ? That 's what I want to know . " // " I am , " Kugler says . // What do these men want ? Kugler , a reserved and formal man who strikes many people as utterly unapproachable , tries to collect his thoughts . Have they come after him ? Or do they know about the people in the secret annex ? Has someone betrayed them ? Everything has gone smoothly for two years and a month . Impossible that now , of all times , when the Allies have finally made a breakthrough in northern France and are on the advance , that now , with liberation only weeks away , now , when the tide has finally turned ... // A few seconds pass , then his hopes fade . These men know . Denial will only make matters worse . // " You have Jews hidden in this building . " Silberbauer 's words have the grim sound of a verdict with no possibility of appeal . There is no way out . // Silberbauer is in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine . He orders Kugler to lead the way . // Kugler obeys . What else can he do ? The men follow him , their pistols drawn . Kugler 's brilliant blue eyes seem  --  more than ever  --  like an impenetrable wall . But his perfect self-control conceals a feeling of paralyzing helplessness . His mind wo n't work ; his familiar surroundings blur and fade before his eyes . It feels like the final moments before a thunderstorm , muggy , oppressive , threatening . Questions torment him : Who betrayed his charges ? A neighbor ? An employee ? And why today of all days ? // Seemingly indifferent , he walks down the corridor that connects the front of the building with the rooms in the rear . One by one he climbs the narrow steps that turn to the right like a circular staircase . The strangers are at his heels . Silberbauer still has n't gotten used to Amsterdam 's terrifyingly steep stairs . Fourteen , fifteen , sixteen . Now they are standing in a hallway whose beige-and-red flowered wallpaper makes it look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway to the spice warehouse , ahead of them a high bookcase : three shelves crammed with worn gray file folders . Above the bookcase hangs a large map of the kind seen in government offices or in schools : Belgium , in 1:500,000 scale . // " Open up . " Of course  --  they know . A yank on the bookcase and it swings away from the wall like a heavy gate . Behind it , a high step leads to a white door about a foot and a half above the floor ; the top of the door is hidden behind the map on the wall . The lintel of the door frame is padded with a cloth stuffed with excelsior : it 's easy to bang one 's head . // Have the Franks heard the loud footsteps and the unfamiliar voices ? When Victor Kugler hesitates , the SD men urge him on . Right in front of them , another stairway , barely wide enough for one person , leads to the upper floor of the secret annex . Kugler goes up the left side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first person he sees is Anne 's mother , Edith Frank , sitting at her table . " Gestapo , " he says under his breath . His dry lips ca n't form another word . He is afraid she will panic , but she stays seated , frozen . She looks at Kugler and the intruders impassively , as if from a great distance . " Hands up , " one of the Dutchmen barks at her , his pistol in his hand . Mechanically , she raises her arms . Another policeman brings Anne and Margot in from the next room . They are ordered to stand next to their mother with their hands over their heads . // Two of the Dutch policemen have run up the stairs to the next floor . While one of them covers Mr. and Mrs. van Pels with his pistol , the other storms the small room next door . He frisks Otto Frank and Peter van Pels for weapons , as if they were dangerous criminals . Then he herds them into the next room , where Peter 's parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their heads . " Downstairs with you , and make it quick . " The last to appear , with a pistol at his back , is Fritz Pfeffer. // The SD men seem pleased . Eight Jews at one blow . A good morning 's work . " Where is your money ? Where are your valuables ? " Silberbauer asks , threateningly . " Come on , come on , we do n't have all day . " The eight captives appear incredibly calm . Only Margot has tears running down her face , but she is silent . // Otto Frank feels that if they cooperate with their captors everything will turn out all right . The Germans are frightened themselves . They know about the Allied offensive , too . They know the end is only weeks away . Otto points to the closet where he keeps his family 's valuables . Silberbauer orders his henchmen to search the other rooms and the attic for jewelry and money . He pulls the Franks ' bulky strongbox out of the closet . His eyes search the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leather briefcase  --  Anne 's briefcase , actually , because Otto has given it to his daughter as a safe place to keep her personal papers . // Silberbauer opens the briefcase , turns it upside down , and dumps Anne 's diary , notebooks , and loose papers out onto the floor . " Not my diary ; if my diary goes I go with it ! " Anne had written four months earlier . Now she watches impassively . Silberbauer , irritated by how calm his captives seem , empties the contents of the strongbox into the briefcase and bellows , " Hop to it . You 've got five minutes to get ready . " As if in a trance , all eight get their emergency packs from the next room or from upstairs , rucksacks that have hung packed and readily accessible in case a fire broke out and they had to abandon the building . They ignore the chaos the Dutch Nazis have created in their search . // SS Oberscharf ? hrer Silberbauer ca n't stand still . In his heavy boots , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his marching is intimidating , but it helps him pass the time until everyone is ready to leave . He is thirty-three years old ; his pale blond hair is cropped short , in military fashion , over his large , fleshy ears . His lips are pale and thin , his eyes narrowed to slits . An ordinary , rather nondescript fellow : obedient , deferential to authority . It is obvious that his uniform gives him his place in life . He has the upper hand here , he thinks , and beyond that he does not think . He obeys orders . Clearing out this annex is all in a day 's work . Originally a policeman , he joined the SS in 1939 . In October 1943 , he was transferred from his native city of Vienna to the Amsterdam unit of the Gestapo 's Department IV B4 , the so-called Jewish Division of the Reich Security Headquarters in Berlin , whose job , under Adolf Eichmann 's command , is the efficient " solution of the Jewish question . " Silberbauer 's wife has remained at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stares at a large gray trunk on the floor between Edith Frank 's bed and the window . // " Whose trunk is that ? " Silberbauer asks . // " Mine , " Otto answers . " Lieutenant of the Reserves Otto Frank " is clearly stenciled on the lid of the steel-reinforced trunk . " I was a reserve officer in the First World War . " // " But ... " Karl Silberbauer is obviously uncomfortable . This trunk has no business being here . It upsets his routine . " But why did n't you register as a veteran ? " Otto Frank , a Jew , is Silberbauer 's superior in military rank . // " You would have been sent to Theresienstadt , " he points out , as if the concentration camp at Theresienstadt were a health spa . // His eyes dart nervously around the room , avoiding Otto Frank's. // " How long have you been hiding here ? " // " Two years , " Otto Frank says , " and one month . " When Silberbauer , incredulous , shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right . Next to the door to Anne 's room , faint pencil marks on the wallpaper record how much Anne and Margot have grown since July 6 , 1942 . Silberbauer 's eyes come to rest on a small map of Normandy tacked to the wall beside the pencil marks . On this map , Otto has kept track of the Allied advance . He has used pins with red , orange , and blue heads , from Edith 's sewing basket , to mark Allied victories . // Silberbauer struggles with himself , then says in a choked voice , " Take your time . " Is he about to lose his self-control ? Has something here touched him ? While his assistants guard the captives , he retreats downstairs . // Silberbauer walks through the smaller office , where Victor Kugler was working and where his assistant , Johannes Kleiman , is now being interrogated , then through the windowless hallway , to the large front office . Beyond the windows that reach nearly from floor to ceiling , sunbeams sparkle on the waters of the canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front office . Her husband , Jan , had dropped by , as he did every day at noon , and Miep had secretly slipped him the ration cards she used for the annex residents . Then she had hustled him back out the door . Though Miep 's coworker , Bep Voskuljl , could hardly see through her glasses for her tears , Kleiman sent her off to tell his wife what had happened and to give her his wallet for safekeeping . Miep , too , received permission to go , but she chose to stay . // " Well , " Silberbauer says to her in German , " now it 's your turn . " His Viennese accent sounds familiar . Miep was born in Vienna and lived there until she was eleven . // " I 'm from Vienna , too , " she says in a steady voice . // A fellow Viennese . The Nazi was n't expecting that . But it 's important to stick to routine . Identity card . Standard questions . Silberbauer is in way over his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Jewish trash ? " he yells at Miep , as if shouting might help him keep the self-control he 's on the verge of losing . Since the Allied landing in Normandy , actions against Jews had almost entirely ceased . The SD was preparing for the defense of Holland and had more important things to worry about than the Jews . But the officer in charge of Silberbauer 's unit had made an exception ; he simply could n't ignore the tip the unit had received from an anonymous telephone caller . And now Silberbauer has all these complications to deal with . // It requires all Miep 's strength to keep calm , but she does , looking Silberbauer straight in the eye . He finally quiets down , mumbles something about feeling sympathy for her , and says he does n't know what to do with her . Then he leaves , threatening that he will come back the next day to check on her and search the office . He wants to put this assignment behind him and get out of this wretched building . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a delivery truck without windows . Carefully guarded by the Nazi policemen , the eight captives come down the stairs from the annex one by one , walk the corridor past the offices , go down another set of steep stairs , and , finally , outdoors . For the first time in two years and a month , they are on the street . The sunlight blinds them . Inside the truck it is dark again . // Miep remains behind with van Maaren . Lammert Hartog seized the first opportunity to pull on his jacket and disappear . The police have taken Victor Kugler and Johannes Kleiman away with the others . Miep sits at her desk , stunned , exhausted , drained . She could leave now , but she stays . What can she do to help her friends ? Is there any way to rescue them ? Will the police return ? // Minutes pass , or hours  --  Miep ca n't tell . Jan finally comes to find her . Bep comes back , too . // Joined by van Maaren , they make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door behind the bookcase and taken the key , but Miep has a duplicate . Once inside , they are stunned by the mess the police have left behind . They have pulled everything out of the closets , torn the beds apart . The floor of the Franks ' room is covered with notebooks and papers . Among them is a little volume with a checkered cover , like an autograph book . It is Anne 's diary . With Bep 's help , Miep quickly gathers the papers together . They grab a few books they borrowed from the library for Anne and Margot . Otto 's portable typewriter . Anne 's combing shawl . But no valuables to keep for their arrested friends . The police have stolen everything of value . // It 's late , but outside the sun is still shining , bathing the facade and the interior of 263 Prinsengracht in the clear golden evening light of a Vermeer . Miep collects Anne 's diary and the many loose pages without reading a word and puts them in her desk drawer .
