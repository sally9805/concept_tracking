Section : FICTION It had been a deeply unsatisfying spring . In the five years Phil had lived in Clinton , Montana , there had never been one like it : unseasonably cold , relieved by rain and sleet . The old-timers saw it as a sign , redemption from the greenhouse effect . " This is the way it used to be , " they said , " before the world turned queer . " They saw it as just retribution for all the newcomers who 'd landed in Montana . Phil preferred to think of it as an anomaly , since he was still an outsider to the locals , something he hoped he and his wife Dolly would live down . He wanted to believe the next decade would offer short winters and warm springs . This spring , even the field mice were shocked back indoors , nesting in insulation . Dolly discovered the most recent brood in the drawer under the stove . She 'd heard the mice clatter pot covers in the night . To Phil 's way of thinking , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steady one in their marriage . Even when Phil had taken early retirement from his accounting job at fifty-seven and a reduced pension to avoid layoff . Even when their only child , Lucy , married badly and moved to Brazil , her correspondence reduced to postcards with postscripts : " Roger 's changed , " or " He stopped drinking , " or " Not fighting so much . " Like they should be relieved . <p> It was n't long before Phil realized the old-timers had it wrong  --  this weather did not signal redemption , but apocalypse . His first glimmering of it came at five in the morning , watching Dolly scrub out the stove drawer . She stood at the sink in her flannel gown and sheepskin mules . Her hair was braided down her back , her back wider than it had been when she was a young woman , but straighter . As straight as it had needed to become , given their history . Next to her , on the drainboard , was her favorite blue delft plate . Arrayed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pink . At a glance , they looked like a confectioner 's mistake . <p> " Babies are not a pretty sight , " she said , nodding over her shoulder at the plate . " They 're still only half-baked , and anything else is a rationalization . " <p> " Lucy was pretty enough , " Phil said . <p> " You were biased . " Dolly wiped out the drawer and slid it back in place . " You barely saw our baby , working as hard as you did . You hardly knew her . " She picked up one of the infant mice . Between two fingers she rubbed its head across the plate with a squeak , like a child might wield an eraser on paper . She lay the broken one next to its siblings . " If we had it to do over again . . . " she said , and proceeded to kill the others in the same way . <p> " What ? " Phil asked , focusing on the stove  --  its clamped doors , the elements cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay more attention , " she said . " We 'd see the way things were going , before they got so far . " She lifted the plate . " Where are the parents ? " she asked . <p> Phil sat quietly , shrugging his shoulders . What did he know of mice ? He was only human . He was a man who had given most of his years to the process of addition and subtraction , balancing figures , facts provided and the formula known . Instead of answering her question he made coffee and fried long strips of bacon , eggs over easy and buttered toast . Dolly set traps smeared with peanut butter . " Mice are relentless , " she said . " They 'll just start all over again . " After breakfast , they took the babies outside , and under the lilac bushes , Doily notched out a grave with a spoon . <p> It was n't as if she went on a killing spree , but the weather stayed bad and there were mice . In between the killing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained . Clean enough to be healthy , messy enough to be a home . She was in the tail end of her latest hobby , one of many over the years . Their house was testimony to her infatuations  --  swarms of afghans , stained-glass sun catchers , decoupage , oil paintings , ceramics . This time she 'd taken up quilting , until the chairs were fat with pillows , the sofa a confusion of crazy quilt . Phil liked to think she was a woman driven to creating . He liked to believe he had some part in it , driving Dolly to craft stores , and he was never disappointed in the results , even when Dolly clearly was . <p> He should have known she was on the edge of something new  --  the slowing treadle of the old sewing machine , the patches of Rannel and flowered prints slumping on the closet floor . He should have read it like the weather . She made trips to the library , brought home the Mammal Collectors ' Manual , the Collection and Preservation of Animal Forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staking out rows in dirt too wet to turn , his only hobby of fifty-odd years , his only act of creation outside of his child and that more an accident , a slip of the hand , as they 'd never once in all those years said to each other , Now we 'll make a child , this moment we 'll start a new life . And did n't that seem sad ?  --  that the remainder of your lives is circumscribed by a moment of ignorance ? A heedless orgasm ? He knew the instant he put each seed in the ground . Knew the probability of success or failure . <p> The last mouse faced them off in the broom closet next to the dust-pan and the Windex , the base of its tail clamped in the trap . The mouse stood on its hind legs , front legs striking out like a pugilist 's fists , tiny teeth bared . It 's the mother , Dolly said , and Phil did n't know what she meant at first , the five tiny mounds of dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " There 's only room for us in here , " she said gently . And then she lowered the mop down on the mouse , pinning it to the floor . She grasped its head between two fingers , just behind the ears , and with the other hand released the trap . In the light of the kitchen , the mouse clawed at Dolly . She raised it to her face and stared into its eyes . She nodded as if those eyes told her what genitals and biological history could not . It was the mother , she was convinced . She placed it under the glass cheese-bell on the kitchen table , then sat across from it and watched it run slow circles under the dome . <p> " This is n't healthy , " Phil said . <p> " I 'll scrub it out when I 'm done , " she answered , misinterpreting what he 'd said . But he was grateful , not knowing after all how to pursue it or explain his fears . <p> " Do you want me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " she said . " You go about your business . We 'll be fine . " And he wanted enough to believe , or was coward enough , that he did . " If you 're going out , take the umbrella , " Dolly said . But he could not bring himself to do that . The locals did n't believe in umbrellas ; he had n't seen one in five years . Anyway , umbrellas were fixed in his mind with sun-shine  --  a hot sunny day , and Dolly , young again and sweet with wine , sitting on the lawn , a red plaid umbrella braced open over her shoulder to protect their child , asleep in her lap . It seemed all his past was like that now , a triggered picture , a smell , more real than the present sometimes . He supposed it was unfair , all the hard times brought to soft focus , a process of selective forgetting . But he still believed those were the best of times . Outside , the lawn was green as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut . The sky was squalid and pressed on the mountains . He paced out his rows , studied the drainage , charted the mounds for melons and squash , and through the long hours , the neighbor 's horses tore out mouthfuls of pasture and chewed while they stood dreaming , their tails blunt clubs of mud . <p> He came back inside to warm the chill from his bones . He 'd stoke up the wood stove , snug his back close to it , and bask in the steam rising from his wet pants . They 'd share a cup of coffee , as if it were just another day . She would slice him a slab of pie and tease him about his weight , though in twenty years he 'd never veered from the two hundred forty pounds he carried so ably . She 'd suggest a haircut or she 'd recommend a drawer that needed fixing , any number of small chores that needed Iris attention . It was what he found endearing about her , her gentle but competent delegation of tasks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a cutting board next to her , and her quilting scissors , needle and thread , a bottle of alcohol , a box of borax , a wad of cotton , and a small pile of meat that was the mouse , its pelt stripped clean and turned inside out . There was an odor in the kitchen , shocking , sweetly fetid and too large , he thought , for the size of the carcass . He stood speechless , shifting from foot to foot . <p> Dolly scraped off a pocket of fat with a fingernail , then dusted the skin with borax . She measured the wad of cotton against the skin inverted nose to tail , then slipped the skin over the cotton like a sock over a foot , turning it outside right in small increments , the nose , then the ears . The mouse unfolded trader her hands , small legs dangling , wriggling with each tug as if alive . She tucked her finger inside , prodding the cotton into its head , its neck , then laughed as she tweaked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tabletop like a finger puppet . " Can you do the Texas two-step ? " she asked , and the mouse bowed . <p> " What in God 's name  --  " Phil asked , his hand moving before he could think , snatching the thing off her finger , bending her finger in the process so that she sucked in her breath with an " oh . " The fur flattened in his palm ; the tail dangled through his clenched fingers . It felt warm in his hand , as if the skin had n't had time to cool . " Can you explain this ? " he said , a plea and an accusation . <p> She looked at him as if it was their forty years together that needed explaining . " It 's only taxidermy , Phil , " she said , and she peeled back his fingers . She placed the mouse on the table , straightening its limbs , propping it up on its tail . " Imagine this , " she said . " Beads for eyes . " Her fingers fussed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She extended the paws ; she bumped the head up in a challenge . " Voila , " she said . " Mouse Rampant . " <p> The first step . Cut the squirrel from the base of the neck down the center line to the vent . Be careful . Cut deep enough to sever the skin but not to puncture the abdomen . Lift the edge of the skin on each side of the incision and pull away from the body . <p> Dolly 's fingers peeled with a delicate sureness . " Un bel di " from Madame Butterfly played on the stereo . She said opera was conducive to the meditation and patience required for taxidermy . <p> The squirrel was already dead when she 'd found it a week ago . Until today , it had resided in a Ziploc bag in the freezer on top of two chicken potpies and a roast , so that when Phil opened the door its milky eyes had stared back with matched distaste . <p> The thawed squirrel slumped in her hands . " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 's fresh , " she said . She pulled on the skin . " No slippage . It 's perfectly fine , " she said , oblivious to the risks of disease  --  distemper , rabies , bubonic plague . <p> He could not watch what Dolly was doing , her fingers probing under the pelt , severing the membranes connecting skin to muscle . He chose to look at her instead . This was what Lucy would look like when she got older , the same gray eyes that turned color with the clothes she wore or the sky she stood under . The same broad forehead and a tendency toward jowls . But she would never have her mother 's serenity , and that unsteadiness was a dubious gift from himself . Dolly and Lucy were as alike and unalike as mothers and daughters always were . That , he decided , was what had brought on this latest obsession . <p> Lucy had sent another postcard . She was still in Brazil , but she 'd left Roger . " You can breathe easier now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitress in a small restaurant . " I 'm saving my tips to come home . Do n't worry . Everything is under control . " Phil would n't have worried , except for everything being under control . He imagined his Lucy teetering between tables . " Lady of Spain , " the only Spanish tune he knew , was playing on a jukebox . He imagined a cluster of black-eyed men , fingers pinching out pennies for shots of mescal , anticipating the worm . <p> While Phil listed ways he could get some money , Dolly was pulling the squirrel out of the freezer . <p> " You could help , " Dolly said . She was offering him the body of the squirrel , tail unraveled from its sheath , back legs snipped at the knee joint . " Just hold tight while I pull . " And he found himself holding the clubbed legs . The pelvic joints popped , and the skin pulled up . Should n't there be blood , he wondered , his thumbs moving onto the abdomen for better purchase . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tiente la tua paura , io con sicura fede Paspetto . " Keep your fear to yourself , she cautioned , and sang on about faith and the lover who would return , while Dolly snagged the forelegs free with a crochet hook and crimped them with a pinking shears . Phil dropped the squirrel . <p> Rain beat his windshield in slugs . If he drove forty miles east he might outrun the rain . If he drove four hundred miles west the rain would turn warm . If he drove to Arizona he could bask on a rock like a lizard . His skin would go floppy with dehydration , hang from his elbows in drapes . He cranked up the heater , and his glasses fogged . <p> Twenty miles south , Missoula had the only shopping mall within two hundred miles . It was n't as if he liked malls , but as Dolly said , " It 'll keep you off the streets , " and in weather like this he was n't about to take offense . He could buy garden tools and underwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , the mall seemed too formidable , his needs insufficient . He stopped at the East Gate . Lounge instead . <p> The bar was small , twelve stools and a television overhead . Four groups of tables backed by a row of poker machines . Off to one side was another room , bright with windows , paneling that might be found in a Legionnaire hall , more tables and shuffleboard . Phil thought it a singular bar . There were no trophies , no shoulder-mount elks , deer racks , bobcats , hang-jawed moose , no Rocky Mountain goat under Plexiglas . He thought of all their dinners in restaurants whose walls were ornamented with taxidermied animals . From the start , Dolly had been intrigued . She would stare at them . He 'd thought it was boredom . He was a poor conversationalist . But maybe it was the glass eyes that winked in candlelight . Or maybe it was the elk mount being groomed with a Dustbuster that first turned Dolly 's head . What had been the first impulse ? And why did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just another whim  --  there was an earnestness to it that had been lacking in her other hobbies , an intent he could see but not understand . She was blind to the results , the stiffening animals in mocking poses , as if she could , as if anyone could , transfigure death . He surveyed the beer signs on the East Gate walls . It was late afternoon . There were three people in the bar . Phil made four . <p> He sat next to a man , kept his distance from the large woman who crowded two stools . It was n't as though he needed this , he thought , and took a chaste sip of beer . It was n't as though he was running away , and he could picture the house slipping out of sight in the rearview mirror . But there were some things a man was n't meant to hear . Like the sound a squirrel 's head makes pinging off the sides of a boiling kettle of water . This was a mistake , Phil thought . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then , somehow , stranger 's depressions seemed more palatable . <p> " How about them Lakers ? " he asked the man next to him and then wished he had n't  --  " California " being particularly taboo in a Montana bar . But the man took no offense , and so he too was an outsider , Phil figured . <p> " I do n't watch the games , " the man said . " I come for the noise . " <p> Which prompted Phil to wonder about the man 's life as Phil drank his beer and ordered another with a shot of Jack Daniel 's on the side . The man was tidy . His clothes had the sorry look of a suit that 's spent the day in an office : crimped at the waist , stretched across the back , the collar loosened so you could see the chafing around the neck . Phil found himself almost homesick for it . What had five years of retirement given him but this vague dissatisfaction ? It was n't that he missed the work terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preordained particulars of his day . He looked at the man seated next to him . He decided the man had no children . He decided the man had no wife to open his seams as he grew out and older , like Dolly did in the night while Phil was sleeping , easing seams strained beyond tolerance . <p> He ordered two more drinks . One for himself and one for the man who liked noise . And that reminded Phil . " You know what sound a squirrel 's head makes boiling in a pot of water ? " <p> The man turned to him . " This is a joke ? " he asked . <p> Phil paused to consider that . " Only if it 's not in your own kitchen , " he said . " My wife 's taken up taxidermy . " He wanted sympathy . <p> " I hunt , " the man said . " Ca n't seem to land a decent buck , though . It 's not the same when you mount a doe . " <p> " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had one in my sights . I 'd have had to take off the door to get it in the house . The sucker was that big . " <p> " You 're not listening , " Phil said , and the man 's arms swept out to show the scale of the rack . Phil downed the shot , ordered another . <p> " Lined up in my sights and some goddamned fool down on the highway  --  " <p> The woman at the end of the bar was crooning to herself . Phil leaned forward to see better . Her breasts were ponderous , lying on the bar , and he imagined himself stretched out on the slab of them , blinking in the Arizona sun . A harmless dream , the warmth , the soft flesh , and then her hand lifted and he saw the hairy tumor growing out of the cleft of her blouse . Phil blinked . His chest squeezed , and the Jack Daniel 's rose at his shame . She crooned to it , stroked it sweetly , and it raised its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still telling his story , punctuating it with hands and energetic elbows , buffing Phil in the rib cage . Phil found himself moved , unexplainably , to violence . He imagined grabbing the man 's suit , bunching it in a fist around the man 's throat . And then he imagined himself stuck there holding it , feeling foolish and at a loss for what to do next . The bartender stopped wiping the bar . " You need a drink ? " he asked , and the woman tucked the kitten into her handbag and scooted off to the rest room . Phil pictured the man still hanging in his hands , arms at his side , too small to be angry , even at an old man like Phil . <p> Phil backed off the stool . He left a two-dollar tip on the bar . He walked quickly away , feeling worse than when he 'd come . If only he 'd taken a swing at the man . If only the man had swung back . If only he 'd never driven the twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back he heard the man ask , " Does she do fish ? " <p> They traded their car in for an older pickup truck , sent the extra cash to Lucy . It was the best they could do , as Dolly had said no to a second mortgage . " We 'd never be able to make the payments , " she said . " We 're too old . " Dolly sold a quilt for one hundred dollars . She mailed the money in a separate envelope to Lucy . It made him feel unaccomplished . He was being silly , he told himself . These were modern times , and no one expected the man to come to the rescue anymore . He should feel relieved . <p> Dolly mounted the squirrel on a sawed-off tree limb and fastened it to the wall . The squirrel was in the act of climbing , one foot raised for its next purchase . Its face was turned over its shoulder , looking down as if something were close behind . It looked frightened . It looked vaguely familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then avoided that wall from then on . <p> Because Dolly had never learned to drive , she sent Phil out looking for roadkills . " I have to get in practice for the season , " she said , meaning hunting season , he supposed . She planned to advertise . Sure she was a beginner , but she would be cheap . He spent the next two weeks looking for a kill . She gave explicit instructions : nothing too old , nothing too damaged , no bloat or flies . He kept his eyes on the mountains . He watched the sky for redtails and osprey . The weather remained cruel , and the land looked blighted , the fields slathered with water . In the few hours of sunshine , he 'd park the car , tramp into the nearest field , and lay his body in the soaking grass until his back pinched with cold and his belly thrummed with sunlight . He stayed out long enough to convince her , and then he would return , empty-handed , apologetic . Smug . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had not had sex in a while , and that was not uncommon either , excused by the grace of their years . But this evening was different . Phil had gone to bed singing . Dolly followed dutifully , as she had all their years together . They both knew Phil could not be burdened to sleep alone . It was not the time spent sleeping that was the actual burden , but the moment preceding , when his mind fretted , his eyelids fluttered , and his chest labored under her quilts . <p> If animals can sense quakes before they hit , if something in the air riles their fur and starts the saliva flowing , perhaps that is what Phil sensed too . The excitement . The expectation . Rain leached off the roof , and thunder cannonaded down the mountain ranges . The horses in the neighboring pasture ran in erratic circles , raising waves of mud with their hooves . Phil sang to Dolly . He sang like Louis Armstrong : " Well hello , Dolly . It 's so nice to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For two weeks now there had been no viscera on the kitchen table , no skulls boiling in the kettles . The squirrel gathered dust . The mouse diminished in its pose . " Everybody 's staying in out of the rain , " he 'd told Dolly . " Not a roadkill in miles . " He turned the garden in spite of the mud , coerced her to join him . Was n't this better ? Was n't the smell of dirt clean ? So was n't it understandable that on this night he thought of sex ? <p> When he came to " Find her an empty lap , fellas , " he offered his own . He was passionate , as he had n't felt since seventeen when he broke his heart weekly , daily . Something of that came through to Dolly , as she rolled under him , her nipples full as squash blossoms . She encircled him with her legs , and she was a greedy young woman again . Lightning broadcast their movements with huge shadows wavering on the walls . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Phil 's heavy breathing , while outside the earth gathered in a long clench before the heave . <p> Dolly 's fingers spread over his back , kneading deeper . Even in his excitement , Phil felt something disagreeable in it  --  her thumb easing up along his spine , her fingers punching into his muscles . He thought he could smell an odor . As if skin on skin struck its own atmosphere , like ozone off lightning . It was the smell of meat on meat . He reared back ; he looked at her , at himself , at his penis holding its awkward pose , challenging and white . Mouse rampant , he thought , and felt it crouch and wither . <p> The bed shook , and Phil thought it was Dolly , but saw in her look it was n't ; the door slammed , and somewhere in the kitchen one of Dolly 's hand-painted ceramic plates clattered from the wall and broke . There was a sound like thunder misplaced . Dolly reached up and Phil fended her off , breaking free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and settled into quiet . <p> There was no damage to the roads . It was as if the earth had never shifted . Somehow , he 'd expected to find a new mountain range formed , a lake where a creek used to wander . But the asphalt buzzed under his wheels , no ridges , no pitfalls , no cracks in the world . He watched the shoulder carefully . <p> Phil did n't like to think of last night 's performance as a failure , but rather as an event decreed by nature . It had never happened before , but then he had never experienced an earthquake before either . Dolly was inclined to make more of it . <p> " Something 's gone wrong between us , " she said . <p> " An earthquake came between us . " It was breakfast , and he watched her shell a hard-boiled egg . Earthquakes were unusual in this part of the country , but not unknown . It had been a small temblor that raised thirty-six-point headlines in the newspaper . " Three people died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles down the road . " Was there no respect for the forces of nature anymore ? Was it so difficult to believe that an event of this scale could dampen an erection ? How could she even think about that ? Three people died . <p> " The way you looked at me , before the quake hit  --  " <p> " What do you mean ? " And he was sincerely confounded , as though he had misplaced something . Perhaps the timing . <p> " Not just last night . You 've been avoiding me . " <p> She 'd always been forthright and outspoken , which was a quality he tended to admire more in women he did n't have to live with . He turned the page , searching for the continuation of " Quake . " <p> She skinned the white off the egg , rolled the yolk onto the far side of her plate , as she always did . It had never bothered him before . " Is it the taxidermy , Phil ? " <p> " You 'd like to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of him , explain why he did . <p> " Is it Lucy then ? " She pressed the tines into the yolk , flattening it , dusted it with salt and pepper . " Maybe you could get a small accounting job in Missoula . You know , just a few hours a day . Something to do ? " She waited for an answer , then said softly , " You worry too much . She 's gone . It was inevitable . " <p> He stopped pretending to read . When he looked up , he barely recognized her . She was no one he knew anymore . A squat , tired , sour-smelling woman . She was cruel . Was n't it tragic , to wait all these years just to sit across the table from a stranger in the morning ? Tragic and ordinary . He stood . " You 'll be wanting another dead animal , " he said , and lifted the car keys off the hook . <p> Maybe there 'd be an aftershock . Maybe he would feel it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would ride it out , race the ripple clear into Arizona . Or Texas maybe , where he could pick up a hurricane and ride its backwash down to the bayous . Down to Mexico . After all , he 'd never been there . What kind of a life was it , never to have been to Mexico ? <p> You 're all hot air , he told himself . Lighter than air . <p> Ahead , there was a bird on the shoulder . When he stopped , he could see it was a quail . She had n't tried a bird yet , and then he saw the maggots . It was tempting . It was almost worth it , he thought , as he pulled away from the carcass . <p> He started looking with a new intensity . Inevitable . That was how Dolly saw it . As if he did n't know that . When had Lucy ever taken a step she did n't mean to ? As a toddler , she 'd been fearless . They 'd put up rails everywhere because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked for cliffs . Where had she gotten that fearlessness ? What part of them had betrayed itself in her ? <p> It was unfair , he thought . How few times he 'd held his daughter , bandaged her scratches , listened to her stories . When had his scoldings ever been anything more than an afterthought ? Dolly had always been the first one there . She 'd had all the time in the world to let go . Maybe for her it was a relief . <p> He turned down the Bear Creek road . Something big would be nice . Something overwhelming . An eight-foot pickup bed could accommodate just about anything , he thought . There were rainwater pools in the road , and his truck raised a rooster tail of mud . Bushes were sodden with growth . <p> They should have had more children . That was the trouble with one , not enough distractions . It encouraged too clear a focus . To her credit , Lucy bore their attention well . In high school , she became a well-mannered child ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How to account for that ? She terrified him with her capacity to love carelessly . <p> He turned onto the old two-lane highway , a road he 'd avoided for weeks . Roadkill heaven . He 'd pretty much figured out what he was looking for . He passed up the odd rabbit , prairie dog road stew . It took him an hour and a half to find the right thing , and he smelled it before he saw it . A skunk off in the barrow ditch where it had dragged itself . He did n't so much choke as retch . It was still fresh , the air dense around the animal . It had been hit , deflected off a tire , maybe . Uncrushed . Ripe . He gathered it up on the end of a long stick , flipped it into the back of the pickup , and rode home , into the wind , with the windows open . <p> To deodorize a fur : <p> pre4 lbs finely-chipped bar soa gals . water4 lbs sal soda3/4 oz. borax1/2 oz. oil of sassafras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borax and oil of sassafras . Solution is ready to use when cooled . Rinse the pelt well before tanning . <p> He 'd carried the skunk into the house , draped on the end of a stick . Dolly was in the living room , dusting . When the first whiff caught her , she staggered and turned . " What in God 's name are you doing ? " she yelled , and chased him from the house . " Have you lost your mind ? " she shouted , standing ankle-deep in the front lawn , the dustcloth held over her nose . <p> " Fresh off the wheel , " he said , trying a joke . She was not amused . " Is n't it a beaut ? " But he knew she saw through him . She knew intent when she saw it . He stood there , his arm tiring beneath the extended stick so that the skunk trembled in the air as if rousing from sleep , only to find itself , once again , under the same unsurprising sky . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then started walking away . <p> " Where you going ? " <p> He looked over his shoulder . " To get rid of it . " <p> " No , " she said . " Reasons aside , it 's the right thing . I have to learn to deal with the worst of it . Might as well be now . " <p> The skunk was a discarded piece of meat , the skin sleeping like a tea bag in a bucket of deodorizing solvent . She 'd busied Phil carrying a table and bench onto the lawn , setting up a small cook fire and putting the pot on to boil . The kettle rattled on the wire grate , and the skull bobbed and bumped . Clouds were beginning to clot the sky . <p> Dolly was building an armature of wire and jute string . Phil stood aimlessly at her side , a consequence of mixed emotions  --  distaste and contrition . <p> " What should it look like ? " she asked him . " What was its best moment ? " She measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit up like squirrels ? " He heard the excitement in her voice , but he was too tired to resent it . Bring on the rain , he thought , smite the campfire . Bring on the earthquake and the trumpets . Bring on the rapture . He was ready for a little rapture in his life . " You can bring the kettle over now , " she said . <p> She picked the skull clean with her fingers , the meat slipping off the bone . " You may not want to watch this , " she warned . She had a crochet hook in her hand . " Sometimes I wonder myself how I can do this . " She fished the hook into the back of the skull , dragged it back and forth . She hauled the brain out in bits and pieces . She held her breath . Her hair blew into her eyes , and she raised an arm to push it clear . Her hand shook . He lifted her hair back for her , clamped it in place with the . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sockets , so intent she did n't notice how his hand stayed on her hair , how he stood over her back , stunned with the feel of her hair in his hands . <p> " This is the worst of it , " she said , cutting at the base of the jaw . She gripped the tongue with a tweezer and pulled . The tongue stretched , and then the tweezer bit into the meat . " Too small , " she said , and tried it again with a breaking tool , a pair of blunt-ended pliers she 'd used in stained glass . The table was littered with all the pieces of her past  --  paint-brushes , quilting shears , needles and thread , clay  --  as if all the years had been a preamble to this , all the elements coming together for her . It was a hodgepodge , a sad collection of mismatched tools . Heroic , he thought . <p> " Oh , " she said . " How could I forget . " She looked over her shoulder to see him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to thank us for the money . She said we did n't have to do that , but she understood . She wants us to know she 's happy . She 's met someone . A Canadian exchange student at the university . They have lots in common . I asked her what and she said , ' North America . ' " <p> He should not have been amazed . It was so like Lucy . He looked at Dolly , then down at his hands . Lucy was the competent one . <p> " If we do n't mind too much , she 'd like to use the money for a divorce . " <p> " What did you tell her ? " he asked . <p> " I told her she was welcome . She asked me to give you her love . " <p> Dolly paused and Phil waited . " Is that all ? " he asked . <p> " She 'll write a long letter , she promised . " <p> " Another postcard . " He smiled . " She 'll find her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her way here , " Dolly agreed . <p> Phil sat on the bench next to Dolly . " All of that came out of there ? " he asked , pointing to the tongue that lay on the table . <p> " Surprising , is n't it , " she said . " It was good to hear Lucy 's voice . You should have been here . She sounded that well . " <p> It started to rain , scattered drops that pelted the plank table . A cold drop spattered down Phil 's neck , and then another on his back . They struck like tiny blows . Their child was gone , one way or another . Here he was , sixty years old , in a place he had yet to learn to call home . His daughter was getting a divorce and in love with a Canadian in Brazil . His wife was building a skunk from the ground up , in the rain . As a young man , when he was still green and believed he could construct his own good life to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be this ? The rain began to fall in volleys . <p> Dolly was packing clay around the skull , building cheeks . " Is n't it strange ? You strip it down , skin and muscle , just to build it up again . " She smoothed the clay . " You have to remember it all . This is where the art is . " <p> The fire guttered behind them with hisses . The smoke darkened like . a smudge . What he would n't give for a week of sun , for the blessed days of Montana summers . Each day like the best days of summer he remembered as a child . Clear , hot days and cool nights . They were getting wet . Her face was shining with rain . <p> " We could take it inside , " he said . <p> " You do n't like my doing this in the house , " she answered . Her fingers worked quickly . <p> " I 'll survive , " he offered . <p> " Yes , " she said , and smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd married ; it struck no chord from his youth . It was an earned smile , all the woman she was now . If she was very lucky , if she was half the woman her mother was , perhaps someday Lucy would have that smile . " I 'm almost done , " she said , and continued to work . <p> He left her side , walked briskly to the house . In the living room , he stopped by the console TV , where the mouse stood its post . He ran his finger down the groomed fur , brushed the whiskers lightly with a nail . Its ears were fanned parchment . He bent close to the mouse , studying its face , the poised paws . It seemed as if the mouse could speak to him , chronicle the years , tell him all the things he 'd failed to hear . But there was only the sound of the house , the odd bumps of wood and wind , his solitary breathing . He walked to the hall closet . It only took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned to the bench , she was still there , her blouse opened and tented over her hands , trying to keep the skull she worked on dry . Her breasts were exposed , soft and worn , the skin already loosening from her bones . He wanted to touch her . He wanted to gather her up and hold her close . He raised the umbrella over them . They sat side by side , the sound of the rain lively on the umbrella . <p> <p> By CLAIRE DAVIS <p>
