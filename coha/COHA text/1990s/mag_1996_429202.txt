When you 're leader of the pack and everyone 's depending on you , Headnote it pays to have good people skills . // Two summers ago , while heading up a canyoneering course in the Grand Canyon , I came upon a half dozen young men arguing nearly to the point of violence . They had been hiking since morning and were lost , sunburned , and long since out of water . Their group leader , who seemed annoyed with our arrival , told us everything was " under control . " He said he was " explaining " to his friends that they were n't lost , they were just " a mile or so " from their campground . He showed me where he thought we were on his topo map , pointing to a canyon that was about 7 miles away . After rerouting them  --  making sure they saw what I was doing with the compass and map  --  and providing enough water and advice to get them safely back to their camp before dark , I gathered my group and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the young men mutter , " Heck with this . Next year I 'm going to Vegas . " I spent the rest of the afternoon wondering how many others have been turned off to the great outdoors because of ill-prepared leaders . People who study such things have debated the topic of backcountry leadership for decades . Dozens of insightful books are available and the number of outdoor leadership schools has increased dramatically in the past 30 years . But should leading a few friends into the mountains for a weekend require that you take a course in leadership or read books ? Or what if you suddenly find yourself elected leader when you thought you were just along for the ride ? Sometimes , leadership is thrust upon us whether we want to head up the group or not . Fortunately , there are a few fundamental concepts , tips , and tricks that can help keep any outing from going awry . First , understand that if there is more than one other person in your party , the group should appoint an " official " leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the National Outdoor Leadership School ( NOLS ) , and the Wilderness Education Association , and author of The New Wilderness Handbook , " Every group that ventures into the wild outdoors should designate a leader . The democratic process might be workable under ordinary conditions , but in the out-of-doors , when there 's a conflict of opinion , an unexpected storm , or an accident , someone must be in authority . " So how do you decide who should be leader ? " The general model of leader as dictator died in America a decade ago , " says John Gookin , curriculum director and instructor for NOLS . " People like to he in on decisions that affect them . It 's important to be able to say , We did this ourselves . ' A more modern approach is the leader as facilitator , establishing consensus and pulling out the latent abilities of the group . " Every person has unique abilities , insights , and interests , ranging from using a map and compass , to reading the weather , to flipping excellent pancakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if encouraged . As the most experienced person in a group , and , therefore , the elected facilitator , you should ask about people 's skills early on , then during the trip call on group members to help solve problems or lead others through a situation . For instance , if your group needs to stop and assess where it 's headed , ask a member who 's good with a map to point out a route on the topo and explain his choice to the others so they 'll learn something . If no one in the group is map smart , ask a volunteer to take a stab at the route . Then without making him feel stupid , run through the proper map-reading steps so everyone will understand where he went wrong . Fostering this type of group interdependence , or " shared leadership , " allows each member to develop skills , while also gaining a sense of selfreliance . Plus it encourages teamwork and pushes the group to work as a unit . Finally , because no one is " in charge " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the group 's confidence and morale . Group members feel less anxious about their individual performances and more readily broaden their own capabilities , encouraged by the initiative and input of others . There is one scenario when a single authoritarian-type leader is essential and that 's during an emergency . It could be medical in nature , or perhaps you 've suddenly encountered a swiftflowing river lacking a foot bridge . In these situations , group members must be flexible and defer to the person with the most experience and training applicable to the situation at hand . It helps to designate who will take on various roles at the start of the trip , before it becomes an issue . ADVICE FROM THE FIELD The backcountry instructors at Outward Bound , NOLS , and the American Alpine Institute teach both technical and " process " or " soft " skills-anything having to do with promoting a safe and productive social dynamic . Talking with several of them revealed three fundamental skills you should possess to be a good leader : 1 . Know your stuff : First and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to anticipate all the potential safety issues , and to trust unfailingly in your own judgment . Experts consider having advanced first-aid certification , map and compass skills , and a firm environmental ethic to be the minimum requirements of a good leader . Learn new techniques or brush up on old ones by taking classes offered by hiking clubs , outdoor gear stores , and college recreation programs . Read about skills in magazines and books , and talk to others in the field . Above all , get out in the field and practice . It 's also important to familiarize yourself with the chosen destination ahead of time , especially if you 're with folks who are new to backpacking . Use the most current maps available , and plan evacuation routes . Since accidents have a tendency to happen at inconvenient times , you must always be ready to find help . Never enter an unfamiliar wilderness area without first knowing how to reach help in an emergency situation . 2 . Be conservative : Realistically assess your own abilities and those of your group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your own experience , while also figuring in the skill levels of your group members . What your group can do versus what they can do comfortably are two very different concepts . To keep your judgment on track , use the " deja vu " check . At any given point on a trip , can you say with certainty you 've been in similar terrain ? Have you mastered this type of water ? Climbed this kind of rock ? Are you familiar with this type of weather ? Have you used this piece of equipment before ? Even if you can answer " yes " to such questions , be wary of the illusion of expertise . The backcountry is complex and unpredictable , and to approach it without sufficient humility is to invite disaster . 3 . Keep the lines open : All too often , leaders have the technical aspects of a trip down pat , but neglect the social aspects . Just because group members are old friends , do n't assume the relationships can bear the weight of conflicts and disagreements that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by having group members discuss their ambitions , expectations , and concerns . You can do this while driving to the trailhead or sitting down for that final restaurant meal before hitting the trail . * Be sure everyone has all the necessary information regarding plans for the day , difficult terrain , safety concerns , and special procedures before it becomes critical . Deciding for others what they should and should n't know can be dangerous . * Everyone should be encouraged to voice their reservations , needs , and preferences as soon as they arise . If this has n't been made sufficiently clear , you may see the early warning signs of frustration ; people tend to withdraw from a group or become curt before an emotional dam breaks . Always be prepared to talk your way through stress everydaywisdom ful situations . Meals and rest breaks offer excellent opportunities for members to share their thoughts . When stopping to talk with each person is difficult or inconvenient , I use a shorthand means of communicating I call the " thumb test . " To get a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply ask them to respond with either a thumbs up ( " I 'm fine and happy to continue " ) , a thumbs down ( " I 'm having more difficulty than I feel comfortable with and need to stop " ) , or a thumb to the side ( " I 'm fine for now , but may need to stop soon " ) . This allows members of your group to register their needs subtly and from a distance , if necessary . Introducing others to the wonders of the backcountry is gratifying , but it can also be a huge distraction , gobbling up much of your energy and enthusiasm . Try to keep in mind why you 're all out there in the first place . In the words of John Heider in The Tao of Leadership , " The wise leader knows that it is far more important to be content with what is actually happening than to get upset over what might be happening but is n't .
