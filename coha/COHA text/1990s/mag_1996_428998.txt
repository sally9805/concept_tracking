LUNAR PARK RANGER " says the emblem on my imaginary ( broad-brimmed hat . " What 's a lunar park ranger ? " you ask . I think of it this way : Amateur astronomers are like the park rangers you find at , say , the Grand Canyon - courteous , knowledgeable , ready to inform the public . " Geologists tell us the Grand Canyon was carved out entirely by the action of the Colorado River over the last million years . Fossil dating shows the oldest exposed strata at the bottom to be Precambrian .... " Although park rangers were not the ones who figured this out , they 're the ones you 'd probably want to guide you to the bottom , because they know best the landmarks and trails , the danger spots , and the preferred vistas . Likewise , many amateur astronomers have spent countless hours exploring the Moon through their telescopes . They probably know their way around it better than many lunar scientists . And just as a park ranger will select a favorite vista to explain , lunar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such features look in the lunar dawn , at noon , and at sunset . My favorite is the Heraclitus complex . Located at selenographic latitude 49deg south and longitude 6deg east , Heraclitus is best viewed during the Moon 's firstquarter or last-quarter phase . So here 's how I visualize explaining this intriguing feature to guest viewers : Okay , folks . I 've aimed the telescope at the ancient crater Heraclitus in the southern lunar highlands , which is , as you can see , one of the most densely cratered parts of the Moon . Few of the bowl-shaped depressions here stand out from the crowd . At first glance , neither does Heraclitus . But notice that it is part of a three-crater complex  --  Heraclitus , Licetus , and Cuvier . Heraclitus is the largest , measuring 56 miles in diameter , while Licetus and Cuvier are both 47 miles across . ( I hold up a map of the Moon so it matches the view through the telescope and point out each crater . As members of the audience slowly take turns looking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Now , look closely at the region marking the center of the three craters . Do you see what appears to be a square ? Maybe this group of craters does stand out after all . Let 's examine it more closely . How were these craters formed ? At the turn of the century some astronomers speculated that lunar craters might be of volcanic origin  --  remnants of the collapse of mighty calderas . But the Apollo missions found no evidence to support that hypothesis . Oh , a few small volcanic features do exist on the Moon , but none of the 2,000 or so named craters on the near side appear to be volcanic . All were formed by meteoritic bombardment . So Heraclitus , Licetus , and Cuvier are all impact features . Photograph Heraclitus and its interesting surroundings are best observed around first-quarter ( as shown ) and last-quarter Moon , when the terminator regions are dramatically illuminated . The boxed area represents the field shown on the next page . South is up in all illustrations with this article . Lick Observatory photograph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their surface , we have no way to date the craters absolutely . However , their location in the old crustal rocks of the bright lunar highlands suggests they were created during the famed " terminal cataclysm " - a relatively brief though major bombardment that happened about a half billion years after the Moon formed . Since planetary scientists estimate the age of the Moon to be 4.5 billion years , then Heraclitus , Licetus , and Cuvier probably formed about 4 billion years ago . Can we establish relative ages for the three craters ? Both Licetus and Cuvier overlap Heraclitus , indicating that their impacts occurred after Heraclitus had formed . Thus Licetus and Cuvier must be younger , but which is the youngest ? Since Licetus and Cuvier do n't touch , we ca n't use the overlap test . Another way to estimate lunar-surface age is by crater counts ; the older a surface is , the more craters it should have of a specific size , because it has been exposed to meteorite bombardment longer . To get statistically valid counts , however , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth-based telescopes do n't resolve that many in the region . Nor do the Lunar Orbiter and Clementine spacecraft images ! The area is just too small . Photograph Heraclitus ( H ) , Cuvier ( C ) , and Licetus ( L ) form a complex trefoil of touching craters in the southern lunar highlands near Maurolycus ( M ) and Stotler ( S ) . The " square " feature referred to in the text is formed by the walls of Cuvier , Licetus , the linear mountain range ( R ) , and Heraclitus D ( D ) . The youngest formation visible here seems to be the tiny , unnamed craterlet ( Y ) on the inner wall of Heraclitus . Lick Observatory photograph . // We could compare the two craters , though , to see which one is more eroded . Pre-Space-Age books correctly portrayed the Moon as a world devoid of atmosphere and weather , but they incorrectly assumed there is no erosion . The finest astronomical artists of that time , including Howard Russell Butler and Lucien Rudaux , imagined the lunar surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as when they first formed . Today we know that the very lack of a lunar atmosphere actually exposes the surface to the bombardment of a micrometeoroid " rain . " Tiny particles of dust traveling faster than bullets slowly erode lunar formations . Furthermore , bigger meteoroids produce blasts that can destroy or blanket the surface where they hit . A large meteorite hitting near an existing crater will " age " the latter instantly . The blast itself may directly damage the crater , and the resultant shock waves and flying debris will do more destruction . Dust falling from the hot gases created by the explosion will finally blanket the surroundings . Can this knowledge help us to date Licetus and Cuvier ? ( I hold up the two images above , taken by Lunar Orbiter spacecraft . ) If you examine closely the rims of the craters , you will notice that the crest of Licetus is a very crisp line with an abrupt transition from the sunlit side to the shadowed side . Cuvier 's rim crest appears much more mellow , with a broader transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuvier is the more worn-down of the two and therefore the older . Chronologically , the impact sequence was Heraclitus first , followed by Cuvier , and finally Licetus . What about the mysterious " square " ? If you concentrate on the central floor of Heraclitus , you will see a linear mountain range . This feature is largely responsible for the illusion of the " square . " Its sides are outlined by the mountain range , sections of crater walls , and alignments of craterlets . The square is not a coherent feature ; none of the components are related . ( I hold up a photograph taken at Lick Observatory . ) The square is definitely an illusion . A close look at the Lick image reveals no corner between Cuvier and the crater Heraclitus D. It 's rounded off , but our brains fill in the corner anyway . Heraclitus is not the only crater with a mountain range inside it ; Schiller also has one . However , such features are very rare on the Moon . The Heraclitus range is a straight , uninterrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears , for craterlet walls " supplement " its terminus toward Licetus . The mountain range probably formed much the same way a crater 's central peak does . When the meteorite that created Heraclitus impacted , the crater floor rebounded from the enormous overpressure of the explosion . But this time , something , maybe an existing fault , channeled the rebound into a straight-line formation . Is there anything else outstanding about this complex ? Heraclitus is liberally peppered with craterlets . In contrast , the floors of both Licetus and Cuvier , while showing areas thickly strewn with craterlets , display other large areas almost devoid of them . These " smooth " areas show up well in the pair of Lunar Orbiter images . Are we seeing a difference in cratering rates , or has lava oozed through the lunar crust and flooded parts of the crater floors ? At this time we do n't know .

( I hold up another ground-based telescopic image , reproduced above ) . In this sunset view the central , uplifted area of the crater is still illuminated while the outer , lower regions of the floor are in shadow . Why is the floor so convex ? We do n't know about this either . Finally , look for a small , bright craterlet on Heraclitus 's inner wall not far from D. It appears to be the most recent addition to the group , if we use the " bright equals new " rule of thumb . Note the splash of short , bright rays highlighting this fresh face . The inner rim of Heraclitus , where this young crater sits , is part of the original oldest surface , formed when the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born . ( I adjust my lunar park ranger hat again and hook my thumbs in my belt . ) Now that you folks have been given a few pointers , I hope you 'll go out and explore on your own . There 's a lot of detail to be seen here . I find new things all the time . Enjoy your visit .
