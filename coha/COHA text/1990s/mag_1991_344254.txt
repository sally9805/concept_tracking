The idea that would revolutionize biology flashed into the mind of a hippie- holdout biochemist during a midnight drive in 1983 . While winding through the mountains of Northern California , Kary Mullis envisioned a way of easily copying a single fragment of DNA in a chain reaction that so surprised him , he pulled his Honda Civic off the road to admire the view in his mind 's eye . <P> Mullis instantly recognized he had solved a problem that had fettered genetic research for decades : the fact that DNA samples are often too meager to work with . He turned to his girlfriend , also a biochemist , to explain his idea . " I thought this was a really cool invention that would make me famous , " he recalls , " but she was n't terribly thrilled about it . " <P> She was wrong . The polymerase chain reaction has revolutionized biology and made Mullis famous , though it has not altered his oddball life . A scientific cross pollinator , Mullis , 46 , may be the last of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , virology , chemistry , hallucinogenics , photography and women who are 10,000 days old . At that age , about 28 , " they 're like a ripe avocado , " says the thrice-married inventor . <P> Other scientists call Mullis a genius , but he offers a more modest explanation for his endless creativity : a fervent desire to avoid drudgery and have more time to play . As a boy in South Carolina , he transformed parts from the family washing machine into an automatic door opener so that he could let the dog out each morning without leaving his bed . As an adult , he invented a system to dim lights simply by thinking erotic thoughts . Even PCR was an attempt to devise a less laborious way of copying DNA than the method used by living cells . " When I saw how nature does it , I thought , ' That 's totally crazy . ' " he says . <P> For his great invention , Mullis got nothing more than a one-time $10,000 bonus from his former employer , Cetus . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach near San Diego . A consultant for biotech firms , he lectures and plays as much as he can . His latest game : photographing women wearing nothing but multicolored patterns of light . His ideas continue to bubble forth like an uncontrolled chemical reaction . He believes the AIDS virus alone can not account for the epidemic . He wants to create a computer program that will trick the senses into believing they 've landed in an amusement park as real as Disneyland . " Much of what Kary says is nonsense , " says a friend . But sometimes what he says is so stunning that it may earn him a Nobel Prize .
