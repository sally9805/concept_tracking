Pat Boone  --  not the Pat Boone but only a graduate student in Agricultural Science  --  was driving the oysters down to Mulberry to have them irradiated . He was used to being the wrong Pat Boone but was nevertheless miserable , careening down Interstate 75 in the windless predawn , gripping the wheel of the Food Science van with his troubled pink fingers . He thought he might have a fever ; he kept sneezing and his own freckles kept getting in his eyes like gnats , reflecting off his pale face and blinding him . He whizzed past lit signs and enticements , antic neon-red coffee cups with legs flashing on and off , simulating dancing , and bold messages in balloons above them urging him to WAKE UP . He was awake but dreaming , dreaming of Maura Malone . He saw bits of her  --  breast , hand , thigh  --  but none were what he wanted , or , wanting them , he only wanted more . To be awake at this hour was to be unable to see Maura 's marriage as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told himself . He had two , almost three degrees . He believed the unknown was simply a subset of the known ; he expected , logically , the unexpected . The oysters were packed in dry ice in ten bushel cartons , sitting like obedient campers on the long van seats behind him , the first live food items ever to be irradiated . The preservation process was new , not yet commercialized , and on local news programs almost nightly , angry college students and young mothers could be seen protesting , mildly scornful doctors and scientists rebutting . Month-old irradiated strawberries that looked and tasted fresh had just arrived on the market ; grocery shoppers were videotaped sampling and appraising them . Farmers both excited and skeptical were shown standing in their groves , making thrilling and dire predictions about their industry . The oysters were the biggest story yet ; as a representative of his department , Pat would be a part of history . He had twice been interviewed on the evening news , and The Tampa Tribune woman was going to meet him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down the Florida coast would begin commenting to one another over their English muffins about his funny name . <p> But Maura , Maura slept beside her husband even now : her large , tropical husband with his flourishing mustache , not the kind you hid behind but the kind you cultivated with cheerful , automatic faith , the way you would plant a vegetable garden or have children . Pat had met the man at bars and buffet tables many times and found him unbearable . " I 'm Trinidadian , " he 'd told Pat once , " and we sing when we talk The Trinidadian 's smile was so open and precious that it made a small sound , breaking out upon his large , honest face . Pat shook the sound out of his head and drove sneezing and invisible down the dark and empty highway . <p> In a recent Food Science Newsletter feature story , Maura had claimed to have known within twenty minutes of meeting the Trinidadian that he was " the one The photo showed her standing glamorously beside the Gammacell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to demonstrate . She wore her white coat and held a pint of strawberries she was preparing to feed into the irradiator , the hard fluorescent lab lights making her sleek , tightly bound-up hair appear glossy and beautiful . " Professor Malone operates our own modest machine , " the caption read . <p> Pat clenched the vibrating steering wheel with both hands as though it alone could save him . He had known within twenty minutes of entering Maura 's classroom that she was the one . In a year he had thought this a thousand times , and had even known enough not to say it aloud , known that not saying it was the way to sustain it . And surely the eerie , thrilling consummation of his feelings , her finally humming in the familiar hiss of his shower or standing at his range scrambling eggs as casually as a ghost  --  surely these things were proof of their love 's inevitability . He had known it . Her words in the interview caused him a shocking , embarrassing kind of pain , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not bear to think of the Trinidadian sashaying around so happily unconscious , the way he himself must have looked before he met her . He could not even remember what he 'd spent time thinking about before he met her . His own mind , his own heart , before Maura , were lost to him . <p> He tried as a game to imagine the oysters as cheerful children in his charge , giddy prodigies eager to take part in such a significant experiment , but this was just fantasy and he could n't sustain it . Instead , he recalled something he had n't thought about in years , a childhood vacation on Sanibel Island which he and his brothers had spent feverishly collecting the best whelks and scallops and periwinkles , the rare ones with the live creatures still in them . They took dozens back to their room at the Jolly Roger each afternoon to be boiled on the hot plate , never tiring of watching the mysterious blobs spreading out over the bottom of the pot , the strange sightless animals surrendering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvety smell of the mineral oil they 'd used to polish the empty shells came back to him , carrying with it a surge of the old wonder , the nameless thrill of boiling the sea creatures . <p> But the oysters behind him now were cold and silent and clamped shut , hiding their secrets . His life seemed small and doomed and embarrassing , and the loop of time between his days at the Jolly Roger and the present seemed like someone 's , maybe Maura 's , idea of a good joke . How Maura could be responsible for the sad loop of his life , he could not explain . <p> I am not invisible , he told himself , his eyes blurring . I exist . He wanted to state these things out loud to someone , someone in a position of authority , but he had only himself to address . <p> Ebb and flow , stir and settle , bubble and curl . This was what the oysters knew . But now they sensed a change . Something was happening . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the moment they had come into existence , from even before they had existed , but they had certainly not bargained for this . Excitement was in the air . A new element hissed around them like a predator . Beneath them rumbled more than the usual uncomfortable earth . They stirred thickly in their shells , uncertain . <p> The month-old strawberries , for their part , resented that they were not considered to be " live They understood , in their pungent , opaque way , that life was romance . They had played an important part in more than one courtship . Around them almost always the air harbored human hopes and celebration , or at least appreciation . They knew enjoyment . They knew ceremony . If they were not " live , " what was ? A machine had once been invented to measure their cries when they were bitten into . Another machine recorded and amplified the sounds of insects eating their way through the strawberries ' viscera . Men had gotten rich off these machines , but where were these men now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Pat pulled into the plant 's back lot and rolled down a window to clear , expectant tropical air . The sky was yellowing up for morning , and the swampy , froggy smell of north Florida seemed far away . He backed the van up to the loading dock , thinking of Maura 's Indian ringneck parakeet , who imitated the backing-up beep of her neighborhood 's garbage truck . The bird was retarded , Maura said ; all it did was yell nonsense words and sing over and over what it had learned of " Yankee Doodle Dandy " : " I 'm a doo . " Sometimes when the Trinidadian was out , Maura phoned and Pat could hear the bird exclaiming in the background as though it were desperate to speak to him . Once , lying unclothed in Pat 's bed , holding him , Maura had told him she loved his apartment because it was as quiet as a graveyard . " Oh , thanks , " he said . <p> " No , " she said , " it 's wonderful here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed that day , feeling too moody to get up himself and see her out , but the moodiness had seemed only like love , a particularly strong swoon . She kissed him , already wearing her dark sunglasses , and said again , " I wish I had a place like this , " and then darted out to her minivan and backed out of his driveway using only her rearview mirror , not even turning her head . He remembered watching this from the window over his bed , not wanting to remove himself from the wanton crumble of sheets . <p> Keep your mind on the oysters ! he told himself furiously . <p> He unloaded all ten cartons by himself , as no one appeared to greet him . Each weighed fifty pounds , and when he was finished , his heart pounded with resentful diligence . If Betsy Murphy had come along , she could have helped . She was a girl in Human Nutrition whose short , strong body he 'd often appraised , but he could never quite find time for her . Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , blocking out more solid individuals . He stood by the locked warehouse doors , puffing in what he pictured as a cloud of his own foolishness . <p> A bald man in a blue jumpsuit finally threw the doors open and shook Pat 's hand in both of his , apologizing steadily for being late . " You 're the guest of honor , " he told Pat . Pat began to feel better . Together they hoisted the wax-sealed bushels onto dollies and began wheeling them inside . " You must be tired , " the man said . <p> " I 'm all right , " Pat said . The plant was only weeks old , and the corridor 's whitewashed cinder-block walls gleamed with promise on either side of him . <p> " We 'll just get these babies into the holding room , and then get some coffee , " the man said . <p> " Are you Dr. Roland ? " Pat said , remembering his instructions . The man laughed loudly , throwing back his head . " Oh , no , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The oysters furrowed and trembled , wondering . They felt themselves being moved closer to the source , but the source seemed unusual , unfamiliar . This was not the source they remembered . It was not in the oysters ' nature to be suspicious , but their milky flesh curled a little . They waited , curling and subsiding . Waiting was the same as existing , for them . <p> The man who had invented the machine that measured the screams of fruits and vegetables was tired of waiting . He was tired of getting up every day and drinking coffee out of the same cup and waiting for purpose to come back into his life . No one had cared about his machine for years . No one cared if a tree cried when you cut it . This was the kind of thing people had cared about in the seventies . In the seventies , the man had lived in a wood-frame house that sat jauntily on stilts at the edge of the Gulf of Mexico like some happy mantis sunning itself on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , whimsical foods , grits with wacky garnishes , while he worked on his important machines . His baby daughter , Deenie , crawled around as if motorized , her strange cries filling the airy rooms with promise and egging him on to new inventions , finer tunings . Clouds flew by overhead , hurrying to their satisfying consummations . <p> When had it all evaporated ? It was impossible to trace . The house had long ago blown down in a brief , peevish storm too small to have been given a name . He lived now in a dusty , buggy walk-up with his daughter , who was now a fat nurse , while his wife studied the classics in some stifling , snowbound state up north . Deenie , who could not seem to get a promotion or a boyfriend , came home from the hospital late each night and sat through one silent , reproachful beer with her father before going to bed . He stayed up later , letting the TV 's false light harass his eyes , wondering what was now expected of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people to care again , or was his purpose something else ? The days rolled by , paying him no attention . <p> The man who had invented the machine that recorded and amplified the sounds of insects eating the insides of fruits and vegetables rode his stationary bicycle and whistled a happy tune . Agricultural and Food Science departments at universities all over the country were clamoring for his machine , and large corporations had fought one another for purchasing rights to the patent . They had paid for his stationary bike , his limestone patio , his wife 's pony , his son 's all-terrain vehicle , and some necessary roof repairs on the house . He puffed confidently away on his bicycle , watching through clean glass doors the steam rising off his lawn . Because of his invention , the sky would not fall on him or his family . He rarely thought of his old graduate school colleague , the man who had invented the machine that measured the screams of fruits and vegetables . That story was too sad . His own story had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now that he was a success , no one wanted to hear it . He was expected to shut up and be grateful , and that was what he did . <p> Dr. Roland was demonstrating for Pat the plywood turntable on which the oysters would ride during their irradiation . He caressed the plywood with absent , tobacco-stained fingers , gazing up at Pat with a salesman 's pride and determination . " You 'll want to keep an eye on those lids , " he told Pat , " but otherwise feel free to circulate during the dosing . " <p> The wax lids on the cartons would gradually yellow as they absorbed the radiation , but there would be no other visible change . A makeshift-looking motor was rigged up under the plywood to spin it , like some child 's science project . The oysters , though an important part of history , did not , Pat had learned , merit treatment by the plant 's showy and immense automated system . This little approximation , which might as well be a homemade microwave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show his disappointment . Other than its larger capacity , it was no more impressive than the Gammacell back in Gainesville . What did they think he was , a Boy Scout ? He scribbled figures on his pad , the minutes it would take to dose a carton with x kilograys , the total minutes he would have to keep watch . Dr. Roland stood by with neutral respect , keeping a hand on his machine . " This is quite a load of shells to haul , " he said to Pat . " You order them special ? " <p> " Nope , " Pat said . " Just garden-variety Apalachicola oysters <p> " Oh yes , and your reporter is here , " Dr. Roland said . " She 's out in the reception area whenever you 're ready . " <p> Maura was waking up now beside the Trinidadian ; perhaps he sang when he awoke . A weak , sick terror took hold of Pat : What if Maura planned to visit some other student today , someone she had managed to keep secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand through his own thin hair so kindly , so easily  --  it was impossible . It was impossible that she not love him . " Your body is perfect , " she had told him . " Your body has nothing to do with reality . " <p> " If you 're wondering about safety , " Dr. Roland was saying , " as well you might , let me assure you there is no cause for concern . As you 'll see when you take the complete tour , there 's a significantly thick concrete wall between us and the source . I just thought we 'd best get started right away with these little devils in case there 's a hitch . Plenty of time later to go exploring <p> " Right , " Pat said . He blinked and stamped his feet . " Let 's go . Let 's load them on . " <p> Silent men in jumpsuits moved at Dr. Roland 's command to lift the oysters onto the machine . There was nothing left for Pat to do but watch . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not waste time worrying about what would become of them . They knew they were romanticized by no one , and they lived accordingly , hurling themselves with abandon at mouths and ears , TV screens and light bulbs , suns and caves . If they died , they died . On the wheel of samsara , they had no place to go but up . Life for them held no shame , mystery , or promise , and they did not care who spied or recorded them going about the business of it . <p> Whatever it was , it was beginning to happen . The sun itself seemed to be rotating . Each oyster sat deep in its own mystery , waiting for the shock . The shock was moments away , already sending waves back in time at them , though the waves were impossible to interpret . The air around the oysters was like music . Ordered currents began to flow . The new earth beneath them began to turn . And then the light cracked into them , and the question mark that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . <p> " Back in Gainesville , " Pat told the reporter , " I 'd have to orient each oyster individually . Here we have the advantage of dosing whole bushels at a time . We can study both shelflife and microbiology in one experiment . " <p> The reporter peered at him through grass-green contact lenses , her breath smelling strongly of buttered toast . " How will you be able to tell if the oysters are dead ? " she asked . <p> " We know they wo n't be dead , " he said impatiently . <p> " But just hypothetically , " she said , grinning . <p> He did n't see the joke , but he explained to her that any looseness in the shell was an indicator . There could be no slippage between the halves , none . <p> " Wow , " she said . <p> He glanced over her shoulder at a carpeted vestibule in which was set up a courtesy telephone for guests of the plant . The phone had drawn his eyes throughout the interview , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small table on which also sat a plate of crullers . <p> " What 's next ? " the reporter said . <p> " I beg your pardon ? " Pat said . <p> " What other foods will you be working on ? " <p> " Oh , dead chickens , " Pat said , sighing . <p> " I can see I 'm wearing you out , " the reporter said , finally . She went away looking a little annoyed , her eyes somewhat dimmed . <p> Pat , when she was gone , went and sat by the phone . He removed the pocket dosimeter from his belt loop and set it on the table beside the crullers . It was a small instrument that resembled a Sharpie pen , only with a lens at one end . Zero , it had read when he commenced the tour of the plant , and zero it read now . He had absorbed no radiation . He had penetrated wall after wall within the warehouse-sized building , moving ever closer to the source . At every new level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls , more men . There were earthquake buttons and flood buttons , hurricane buttons and buttons for if someone fell asleep . There were men whose job it was to watch buttons , and men who watched only other men . The whole thing reminded Pat of some giant child 's ant farm . He had gone as close as one could go to the great source , and his dosimeter still registered zero . <p> He looked again at the little instrument and felt his frustration well back up . That 's me , he thought . A big zero , coming and going . Nothing will ever change  --  I am invisible . He grabbed at the phone 's receiver and punched the buttons in a fury . I 've had it with this secret life , he would tell her . Keep your deceptions , your illusions , your stupid , hopeful Trinidadian . Without you , my life will open up like a wonderful picture book , what people know of me will be the truth . The phone was ringing blankly in his ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping . He let his head fall for a moment and felt the pink blood rushing to his face like a child 's hot tears . He felt like a child planning to run away from home . His courage was already dissolving , he could not sustain it . Fine , I 'll call her later , he told himself . From the hotel , let the university pay for it . But even as he thought this , it was already passing out of him , going out of reach like a helium balloon . It was passing out of him and it was gone . He lifted up his head and landed back in the sweet hopelessness of his life . The oysters awaited him . <p> The oysters felt different , but it was difficult for them to say how . They felt as though something had been added or something taken away . They felt vaguely the urge to produce pearls , but they could not produce them . Clearly , they were leaving something behind , moving with smooth speed away from something of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember . They felt frustrated , distracted . Where were they going ? they wondered . What would happen to them ? What were they supposed to do ? Oh , they were only oysters ? Who was there to tell their story , and who was there to listen ? <p>
