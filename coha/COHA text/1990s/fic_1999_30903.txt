Chapter I : Glendora 3/17/57D6/12/57 We 'd been studying Bedouins in my fifth-grade class , how they carried only what they needed or loved on the backs of ornery camels , and how other , territorial groups kept them hopping . In my experience nannies were far more nomadic . They had time at our house to knit just one argyle sock , complete just one jigsaw puzzle , or paint ( by numbers ) just one seascape before my mother made them repack their belongings and move on . I therefore paid little attention when prospective nannies came for interviews , but I can still remember my mother 's words after her first encounter with Glendora . " She could play the wisecracking assembly-line worker who never gets the guy , " Charmian said . " Because she 's too fat to be anything but a supporting character . " " A nanny is a supporting character , " I recall my father , Maurice , pointing out . He was between pictures and temporarily finding domestic matters a kick . " But we are n't casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vrai , " Charmian agreed , using the death-defying remains of French she 'd learned when she 'd played , as she put it , second banana in Ivan the Marriageable . " I wo n't hold the woman 's girth against her . " Charmian herself was exquisitely petite . She described herself to casting directors as the cute-as-a-button type . " It 's best for actors to be small , " she had explained to me , " so they fit gracefully into the frame . " Charmian 's fame , however , had been acquired on the radio , and it had left her discontented . " What 's the good of having the perfect turned-up nose or saucer eyes or hair the color of sunshine ? Who 's to know ? " " But everyone knows ofP&gt; " Please do n't depend on Fleur to accomplish such tasks for herself . She is maddeningly ... delinquent , " Charmian persisted . Glendora 's left eyebrow journeyed halfway up her forehead ; I could n't be sure if it signaled dismay or disapproval . " Let 's see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an adult . She may be ten years old , but we do n't coddle her . No baby talk . No dolls or childish games . Is that understood ? " " If you do n't mind , Mrs. Leigh , " Glendora said flatly , " I fly by the seat of my pants . " It was a shame she could n't actually fly , because wherever Glendora strolled , her footsteps broadcast vibrations across the hardwood floors , through the tiles of our Spanish colonial domicile , and up the faux adobe walls , making the chandeliers jingle . When she reached full stride , the objets d'art and the antique furniture artfully arranged throughout the interior rattled or wavered . This caused Charmian to fret over a particular sixteenth-century statuette . The Sleekd Boy , as we called him , had been chiseled out of Italian marble . Almost a foot tall , he stood with knees pressed together and hands on hips . His head was cocked provocatively , as though he knew something no one else could fathom . The Sleekd Boy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rounded helmet he wore la Donatello 's David , he did n't have a stitch on . This was the only one of Charmian 's treasures I was n't allowed to touch  --  " trop cher , " she said . Nevertheless , I 'd kissed this naked man and rubbed his smooth and compact backside , as well as fingered his creases , crevices , curves , crannies , cracks , and protrusions numerous times . His genitals astounded me , and I speculated untiringly about how they worked . " Glendora 's clumping about is bound to topple my little man . I 'll have to set him out of harm 's way . Quel dommage , " Charmian tsked as she pushed him against the back of the shelf and stuck him down with museum gum . When Glendora was on the move , her spidery , hennaed hair wriggled around her face . She had a face that was n't stingy with its features . You want eyes , a nose , lips , you want full cheeks , then look at me , it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape with almost every word she spoke , as though she found her own thoughts droll . I listened attentively to her speech , enriched by a midwestern twang , as it boldly rang out and echoed through our cathedral-like living room . Though she had an extravagant bosom , there was nothing maternal about Glendora , and the white heavy-duty bra , as glimpsed through her nylon uniform , insisted , Do n't touch . My mother found it astonishing and seemed annoyed when a tall , handsome-in-his-uniform Beverly Hills cop fell for my nanny . " There 's no accounting for taste , " Glendora explained his attraction to her . Jeff parked his gleaming black and white motorcycle in our driveway and hung his helmet from the handgrip . His radio turned up loud , he strode to our front door . From my upstairs bedroom window I spied on Jeff and Glendora as they laughed under the portico at the side of our house . I could have watched for hours though all I could really discern was the patch of skin , like an orange slice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glendora 's sturdy fingers that squeezed Jeff 's neck when he kissed her . Sometimes our gardener , Constantine , had no choice but to pass the lovers when he carted weeds and debris down from our hillside . He whistled , warbled , and chirped like a loquacious parakeet to alert them of his approach . And from my vantage point I observed Glendora , her face reddened , nod amiably to Constantine . I assumed that all our help held our gardener in as high esteem as I did . " He tickles my funny bone , " Glendora had said of Constantine , though Jeff , conversely , ignored him . " Why do you make birdcalls the minute you see Glendora and Jeff ? " I asked Constantine . " Is bad thing embarrassing police , " he explained . " But why do n't you just cough or clear your throat ? " " Because lovers making world go ' round , " he said with a wink . Whenever I passed their way , I came down with a case of the giggles . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monde who are actually attracted to women ... of tonnage , " Charmian commented pointedly . " They 're neurotic as hell , of course , fixated in infancy or something . But imagine the odds of Glendora finding one of them , here in Beverly Hills . A million to one , oui ? " It occurred to me that this was precisely why previous nannies had always chosen to meet their dates away from our house  --  they were dodging Charmian 's judgment . " Jeff 's very nice to me , " I tried to defend him . " Why should n't he like Glendora ? I like her a whole bunch . " " He 's the strong , silent type " and " Still waters run deep " is how Glendora characterized Jeff ; it was true he never said much . But several times , at an hour when other children were in bed , Jeff took me gallivanting on his motorcycle . We roamed the fire roads up beyond the old Chaplin estate . Pickfair with its endless , high , white walls hovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrymore villa by moonlight could have been designed by Gaud . These mansions were all but deserted now  --  or served no other purpose than to shelter dipsomaniacs , my mother claimed . If she was right  --  if they were cobwebbed and dingy  --  I found them that much more intriguing . Then too the desert-scented air shooting through my hair , the throbbing of the motor , the sweep of landscape in my peripheral vision , the smell of Jeff 's jacket thrilled me just slightly less than having my arms around Jeff 's leather-clad waist and my head against his broad back . " God is Jeff 's copilot , " Glendora said reverently . When Glendora had time , late afternoons before dinner or after dinner when my parents were out , we climbed into the broad-beamed Buick my father provided for the help and declared ourselves " on the prowl . " Glendora knew the Beverly Hills police routes as well as anyone on the force , and we followed them as faithfully as pilgrims . We drove with the windows rolled down and the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns , or detectives . I treasured those outings because , for their duration , I could pretend I was beautiful and smart ; I could pretend I was an actress , a writer , and a private investigator all in one ; I could pretend I was Charmian Leigh . Jeff worked north of Wilshire Boulevard , but we never knew if he would be patrolling the flats or tacking his bike in and out of the irregular canyons . Jeff might be hiding behind a clump of ivy on Pamela Drive , where Pamela and James Mason lived , or wedging his bike between the stucco wall and the garbage cans at Lucille Ball 's . Once , we found his motorcycle leaning against an ivy-covered wall on Summit Drive . It took a n extended search to discover him crouching in the shadow of a pillar that held up Fred Astaire 's house . Another time Jeff concealed himself , bike and all , behind Danny Kaye 's eugenia hedge , and on another occasion he parked between the white-streaked , spiny plumes of Jerry Lewis 's dinosaur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ask , " How do you two do it ? " " Your guess is as good as mine , " Glendora invariably responded . Then they would throw their arms around each other and have a good laugh . I never knew if Jeff was playing a game or if all the Beverly Hills motorcycle police purposely stationed themselves in celebrity hideouts , but I knew my job was to cajole Jeff into escorting us to Dolores 's , a local drive-in that stayed open late , at the end of his shift . If I succeeded , Glendora rewarded me with a hamburger , a cheese-smothered slice of apple pie , and a chocolate shake . One afternoon Charmian chided Glendora , saying , " You ought to watch your weight . " ( This embarrassed me terribly . I had been taught by previous nannies never to mention anyone 's physical disadvantages . ) " Why should I ? I 've caught my man , " Glendora retorted , gaily waggling her thick finger so that the jot of diamond on her engagement ring caught the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her remark . " But will he stay on your line , chrie ? " Charmian needled her . " That 's for me to know and you to find out " was Glendora 's tactical rejoinder . " Peut-tre , " my mother said , placing an emphasis on the pooh sound of it . " What do you want me to do ? Stand on my head and spit nickels ? " Glendora joshed . Yet she must have taken Charmian 's jeering to heart , because she stopped eating starches and commenced an exercise regime . Every morning , wearing nothing but her sensible white underwear , Glendora positioned herself , feet apart on the speckled linoleum , in the middle of the cubicle that was the nanny 's room . She breathed noisily for several minutes . Only after she 'd " oxygenated herself " did she begin the difficult task of reducing . This entailed her spreading her arms as wide as they 'd go and making torpid little circles . She reminded me of a rooster attempting flight , though her wattles hung down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions she made would never get her airborne . Still , with a grimace she persevered ; maybe , given a little time , she would have achieved real muscle tone . One Monday evening , when Charmian felt exceptionally relaxed because it was the day after her weekly broadcast , she magnanimously offered Glendora and our cook her Academy card . " I 'm giving you the evening off so you can attend a showing of The Three Faces of Eve , " she told them . " I already saw it at the producer 's house , and since Mr. Leigh is out of town , I think I 'll just relax tonight . Je suis trs fatigue , " she yawned . " It does n't sound like my kind of picture , " Glendora said . " Geraldine Page gives me the willies . " " Then you 're in luck . Joanne Woodward is the star of this particular vehicle , " Charmian proclaimed . " Oh , well , maybe Jeff would like to go with us . " " Only two can get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , what about Fleur ? " Glendora asked . For just an instant my mother wore a look that seemed to say , Who 's that ? It was a look I 'd seen before and one I found unsettling . " As I said , " Charmian announ ced , " only two can go in on my card . Besides , Fleur would n't comprehend a story of this nature . It 's a cerebral drama , loaded with psychological snafus . What does Fleur know of ids and libidos ? " " What do I ? " Glendora asked . " But what I mean is , who 'll keep an eye on Fleur ? " " Is it as hard as that ? " Charmian inquired . It was n't hard at all . Although I did have a habit of dogging my mother 's footsteps when she was at home , I 'd spent so much time alone , I was used to amusing myself . That night , however , my mother cheerfully suggested we indulge in a few rounds of gin . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cocoa too , " she proposed . ( Charmian also adored sweets . ) " Put it on a tray and we 'll drink it upstairs while we play . " Generally speaking , the kitchen was off-limits to me ( my parents thought it degrading for girls to learn to cook ) unless there was something my mother particularly desired . Naturally , I found the kitchen irresistible . Once there , I followed the directions on the Hershey 's cocoa tin , carefully stirring salt , sugar , and cocoa into four tablespoons of water . Then I heated the mixture in a pot and slowly added milk . I took pride in the fact that I could do something Charmian considered worthwhile . Because I was rushing to carry the tray upstairs before skin formed atop the chocolate , I did n't bother to soak or wash the pan or wipe up the trail of cocoa I 'd left between the cupboard and the stove . No matter  --  no one expected me to clean up after myself . The silver tray I 'd prepared with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lace-edged napkins bedecked with a single scarlet rose looked as nice as the trays any of our cooks arranged , an d I considered it praise from heaven when my mother classified the cocoa " divine . " " Do you really like it ? " I asked , trying to snare a second compliment . " It 's the best I ever had , " Charmian said with unusual largesse . My mother played cards intently , and I found her face more interesting than the game . Her eyelids fluttered and her lips hugged a cigarette as she rapidly dealt the cards . Charmian wore this same alert expression when she was studying a script or writing one . Since I personally did n't possess much power of concentration , I admired my mother 's single-mindedness even though it meant that for her I 'd ceased to exist . And inasmuch as I was grateful to spend time in my mother 's presence , I really did n't care that she won every round . ( Years before , Charmian had explained , " The parents who let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandeur . " ) Eventually , cold chocolate sludge covered the bottoms of our cups , and the game seemed to hold no more surprises for Charmian . She gathered up the cards and said , " All right , that 's enough . I 'd forgotten how dull gin can be when no money is involved . Anyway , the cocoa should have made you sleepy , so you better get to bed . " This meant my mother had grown tired of me . I did n't remind her I had no set bedtime , because since February fifth I 'd made it a habit not to complain . On that fateful day my best friend Daisy had been whisked off to a boarding school against her vehement protests . The threat of meeting a similar doom had commandeered my every thought for the last four months . Daisy Belmont was two whole years older than I , but since she was also the daughter of movie people , the two of us had been what Charm ian called confidantes . We were flowers growing in the same field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking her celebrity parents in stride . " In a few more years we 'll be driving . My parents will give me something stylish , no doubt  --  to suit their own images of course . Probably a Karmann Ghia or an MG . A car will spell our freedom from all this hypocrisy . We 'll drive up to San Francisco and marry poets as soon as possible , " Daisy promised . " Poets do n't give a fig about appearances . They only care about heart . " I 'd received only one letter from Daisy since she 'd been banished from Beverly Hills . She 'd said the girls at her Swiss boarding school were as icy and dull as the country itself . She 'd said she was hellishly homesick for California , where there was sun , and saw no reason to go on living without it . I 'd called Daisy 's parents many times since reading her letter , but the caretaker said the Belmonts were out of the country and the house was closed . " Could you just tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd been hired by an agency , the woman said , and knew nothing of the property owners . No , it was essential that Charmian remember our evening together in the best possible light , so I retired graciously . Soon , I was in bed pretending sleep had overtaken me , but actually I 'd lodged a flashlight between my chin and shoulder and tucked the bedcovers over my head . I had no reason to hide  --  no one was going to discover me reading True Confessions magazine ; no one but Charmian was home . And if she found me reading what she called " prurient literature , " she would hardly care . I hid under the blankets only because I liked pretending I was a normal Ame rican child . A story about a young , raven-haired ballerina who had " proved her love " to a teacher of flamenco dance captured my attention . Like all the females in True Confessions , this one keenly regretted her " error of the flesh . " Why should this magazine be considered trash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dire consequence ? Sex was definitely something I planned to put off until old age . The ringing of our doorbell was a happy distraction . I slid from the bed , crawled across the floor , and peeked out between the bottom row of slats in the shutters . Constellations of moths formed and re-formed around the porch light . Jeff stood back from them in the shadows . Charmian had evidently changed her clothes  --  I heard her feathered mules clack down the stairs , and when the door finally opened , she was framed in a golden light . She had on a low-cut , gold tulle negligee , and her yellow hair was pushed back behind her ears so that I could see the sly smile she bestowed on my uniformed friend . I could n't hear what she said to Jeff , but after several minutes he nodded , turned , and walked away . I knew he would return , however , because Charmian remained poised in the doorway . I found it odd that my mother cared to spend time with a cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell you their conversational skills are , at best , scant , " she 'd told me . Maybe Charmian planned to ask Jeff about his intentions toward Glendora . Maybe she wanted to know if he 'd resigned himself to setting a wedding date . Like Charmian Leigh on a surveillance case , I lay down flat against the tapestry runner on the creaky balcony that crossed our two-story living room so that w hen Charmian and Jeff came inside , the architecture of our house rendered me invisible . " A drink ? " my mother suggested . " Is a beer okay ? " Jeff asked , sounding as though he was seeking my mother 's approval rather than saying what he wanted . " I just finished work , so it 's not as if  --  " " What kind ? " Charmian interrupted . " Oh , anything . " He busied himself by pretending to look at the dark oil paintings that lined the walls of our living room . He stopped in front of the tagre . Charmian set her martini and Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italianate table in front of the couch . " This little statue is real pretty , " Jeff called to my mother from across the room . " Why do you hide it way to the back ? " " C'est un bijou prcieux , " Charmian said , sitting down . " You have good taste , anyone ever tell you ? Although I 've never met anyone who did n't like that statuette . " The long blue sofa ran perpendicular to the balcony , and Charmian happened to sit where I could easily see her . She smiled at Jeff , cocked her head , and patted the cushion next to her . Jeff sat on it . My mother took a cigarette out of the creamy white Meissen basket she kept on the coffee table . She picked up the silver Ronson lighter and snapped it ; a celestial glow momentarily lit her face . Jeff , looking stiff , took a nervous gulp of beer . " Nice beer , " he said as though he were talking to a pet . Silence on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abide it even outside the studio ; she did n't wait long for Jeff to attempt conversation . " Do you ever listen to my show ? " she asked , sucking the heat from her cigarette and letting it go . " The Charmian Leigh Radio Mystery Hal f-Hour ? I like to know what my average listener thinks . Do you enjoy it , chri ? You can be honest . " Jeff shrugged ; from my vantage point I thought he looked tense . " I 'm no critic , " he said hesitantly as he wiped away a mustache of foam . " Guess the boob tube 's got me hooked . " " But you have heard my show ? " " Once or twice . Glendora thinks it 's swell . " " I am its star , " my mother said in a morose tone indicating the burden she bore . I watched in fascination as she shifted her eyes back and forth in their sockets as though Jeff 's thoughts were printed out and she was reading them . This was a technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actor who had the lines . " The audience always looks toward the action , " Charmian had explained to me . She 'd become such a practitioner of this ploy that she even used it off-camera . " You look like a starlet , " Jeff said bashfully . Charmian cheered up . " But did you know I created the entire concept of the show ? " She tilted her head just so and opened her eyes wide like Debbie Reynolds . " Well ... " I thought Jeff was going to say " shucks " like a movie cowboy , but he held back . " I think Glen maybe mentioned it . " " From now on , Jeff , I want you to tune in every week , " my mother said , twirling the bowl of her martini glass so that the olive oscillated , " because you 've already given me quite a few ideas . " " Me ? " " Mais oui . You see , The Charmian Leigh Mystery Half-Hour is soon to be on television , so I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character I 'm going to add to the cast ? " " Du n no , " he said . " He 'll have a stunning uniform with a stripe down the leg . He 'll have tall black boots , a gun , and a very powerful machine between his legs , " Charmian said and then winked . Jeff made a sound I could n't interpret and raised his eyebrows . " In order to write this character  --  this good-looking , robust motorcycle cop  --  I 'm going right to the source . And what would you think of my asking the very man my new character is patterned after to play him ? " " You do n't mean me ? " Jeff asked , sincerely surprised . " Absolument  --  will you accept ? " " Well , um , yeah , I suppose . " Even the circle of skin on top of his head blushed , and I wished he had n't removed his helmet . This was the first I 'd heard of a TV show in the works ; in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to creak . But as deafening as it sounded to me , it did n't break Charmian 's momentum . " I think I can talk the network into it , " she said . " Especially if I convince them I know you ... inside and out . I 'd like to be able to say that I 've had access to your entire ... mind and heart . " She gave him her very practiced Jennifer Jones stare . " You would , would n't you ? Give me access ? " " Um , eh , I think so . " " Let 's see . " " How do you mean ? " " Come here , " she said in the lowest tone in her register as she crooked her pointer finger back and forth and grinned . Jeff glanced around as though he thought she was speaking to someone else . It was awhile before he moved closer . Charmian placed her cigarette in the ashtray , her drink on the coaster , and her arms lightly around Jeff 's neck . Then she kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be by mutual consent . Within moments she had disarmed my policeman friend completely . My lips formed words : Wait a minute . What 's going on ? I wished to scold them , but the image of Daisy pining away in a boarding school dorm hovered over me like a cartoon bubble . If I wanted to remain at home , I would have to champion my mother 's activities , no matter how outlandish they were . Besides , a fascinating exhibition had begun to take place : Charmian and Jeff seemed to be in a contest . I thought of those played in Roxbury Park at Fourth of July picnics , but this competition entailed undressing each other while keeping their lips in constant contact . It required much more skill than a two-man gunny sack race , or putting on layers of funny clothes before crawling through barrels . Charmian struggled with Jeff 's belt , a button , and a zipper , while Jeff got his fingers caught in my mother 's tulle negligee . He pulled his lips away from her long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy but they worked as a team : Charmian managed to slide Jeff 's pants down his legs , while he got hold of her lacy French undies and did n't let go . Finally , they were both disrobed from the waist down ; they sank onto the sofa and melded into one another . The tableau they created would have elicited a symphony of birdcalls from our gardener , Constantine . I 'd often overheard Charmian on the phone whispering sugary sentences to would-be wooers . And returning home from parties , she frequently awakened me to describe in sensational detail each of the men who 'd made passes at her that night . Charmian was one of the most sought-after women in Hollywood ; I knew because her publicity said so . But I 'd assumed that what she called her affaires des coeurs were realized in words , not action . As seen from my position high above them , Jeff and Charmian seemed to metamorphose into a beautiful though dangerous insect . It had a blue-black thorax outlined in gold . Neither my mother nor Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their legs flailed . If only Jeff had left his helmet on , it would have been perfect . Even the noises they made did n't sound human . I heard growls , gurgles , mewls , snorts , crackles , and yips . They were so busy , so absorbed , I had the leisure to fully observe them . I saw that Jeff 's backside was as nicely shaped as our statuette but that his legs were dark , hairy , and a little too thick . By Sleekd Boy standards they were a disappointment , so I was relieved when he and my mother changed places . Then Charmian 's pretty , heart-shaped backside appeared to be waving at me , or just waving indiscriminately , with glee . As the realization of what was really occurring , the downright ickiness of the act , penetrated my consciousness , I felt disgusted . Naturally , I had seen Charmian commit far more heinous acts on-screen . As a small child , I 'd watched her in a circus thriller called Bigger Than Life as she stabbed an aerial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note for the Teller , Charmian eased the feet of a policeman into cement shoes before she and her bank-robbing boyfriend tossed him into a lake . ( My mother 's part was abbreviated since she 'd spent the rest of the picture in jail . ) On-screen , Charmian had kissed numerous men . If not , she made it clear that kissing them was her utmost desire . " It 's just a movie . It 's not real . Your mother is acting , " I had been told by nannies when I voiced anger or disgust . And that 's what I told myself now . My mother was acting . She did a lot of acting , even in everyday life . If only I could have shut off my thoughts at the spigot . But the word why flooded into my brain . Why would Charmian bother to pretend she loved Jeff when she said that only men like my father , men like David O. Selznick or Bill Paley , men who could advance her career , truly interested her . Of one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Charmian would not regret her act . Finally , I had to admit that the specter of my mother 's coupling with a man other than her husband  --  my father  --  frightened me terribly . Did this mean she was leaving Maurice ? And if so , what would happen to me ? I would receive a life sentence in a boarding school , would n't I ? Like Daisy , I 'd be looking for a fast way out . My fear made me squirm and I unwittingly attracted Jeff 's attention . In the stupefying moment in which we gawked at each other , I realized I was guilty of a crime . Early in the game I could have pretended I 'd heard a burglar and shouted " Help , police ! " I could have cried " Fire ! " or set one . I could have simply coughed and it would have stopped them . But I was so immersed in the spectacle of Jeff and my mother on parade , I had forgotten all about Glendora . For the next few days Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him no matter how many hours we spent circling his routes . " What 's the story , morning glory ? " Glendora kept asking the air . As she drove , I tried to formulate words that would n't hurt . I did n't dare ask if we could drive by Daisy 's house , as we did sometimes , just to see if there were any signs of life . No matter , there never were . On the fourth night I was paying no attention to our itinerary until I heard the squeak of the eme rgency break . " End of the line , " Glendora said , rolling her top lip toward her nose . I looked up to see that we were parked behind the Beverly Hills City Hall , where the police and fire departments were housed . Like many children in the fifties , I had been taught to consider the police as friends . The idea was reinforced when my class paid a visit to headquarters , where kindly officers served milk and Oreos . Before we left , a sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes he let us experience the just deserts of criminals . Some girls shrieked , some cried , but I calmly tested the cot in my cell , paced the cubicle , and scrutinized the lidless toilet . The bars of the cell seemed familiar , and I found them oddly comforting . If the officer had said I would have to remain inside them forever , I might not have minded . Everyone seemed to know Glendora at headquarters , and we walked right through to the garage . Motorcycles roared past , the squeals of their tires echoing . Pungent gasoline fumes befouled the air . Whether they were whizzing in or revving up , all the policemen looked alike in the polluted atmosphere . How Glendora spotted Jeff I had no idea , but she made a beeline toward one of the dark figures who was putting his bike away . Jeff flinched when he saw us . " So where 've you been ? You hibernating or something ? " Glendora assailed him . She had to yell to be heard above the din . Jeff hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't suppose you 'd want to see me . " " You did n't , huh ? Why not ? " Glendora asked , looking perplexed . " You have n't heard ? " he shouted , eyeing me with suspicion . " You thought a little birdie would tell me why you have n't shown your face ? " " Well , yeah , I guess I did . I thought Fleur would have ... " " What 's Fleur got to do with the price of eggs ? " Glendora drowned out the rest of his sentence as well as the ruckus around us . She was clenching and unclenching her fists . " You better be your own birdie , " Glendora told him . " Yeah , okay , I just thought you knew all about ... everything . " " Hell 's bells , " Glendora said angrily , " I know zilch . " " Oh gee , oh damn , okay , I guess I owe you an explanation . " He looked around furtively as though someone else could hear him through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go change my clothes . " " While I stand here with egg on my face , " Glendora said , but I knew she was suffering from more than embarrassment . " He thought you would have told me ... what ? " Glendora confronted me as we watched Jeff walk slowly toward the locker room . I racked my brain but could n't think of a single appropriate word . Finally , I shrugged . A few minutes later a very ordinary man emerged from the locker room , and I wondered , Where 's Jeff ? Only when the man said " Let 's go " did I realize he was Jeff . Without his uniform , Jeff lacked what my mother called " lan . " His polo shirt was crumpled and slightly bleach-stained , and his arms were n't quite as muscular as I had expected . He seemed shorter , less ruddy , less manly . Without his uniform , Jeff was a big disappointment . Could such a plain sort of person know how to soothe the woman he 'd spurned ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our footsteps sounded like drumbeats . When we got to the Buick , Jeff asked gruffly , " Mind if I drive ? " We could see the glow from Dolores 's Drive-In a block away . Three tiers of cars encircled the diner , so we had to take a s pot in the back , away from the activity on Wilshire Boulevard . Jeff parked behind a gray-green Studebaker , my favorite make of car . None of us said a word until a pretty waitress in a very short , yellow uniform stuck our menus through the window . The name embroidered on her pocket was " Bunny . " " I think we know what we want , " Jeff told Bunny . " I 'll have a cheeseburger  --  hold the tomato  --  and fries and a strawberry shake and a slice of apple pie , " Glendora commanded , thus terminating her diet , such as it was . From the back seat I ordered much the same , but Jeff said , " Just coffee for me . " Then he turned on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of " Who Wrote the Book of Love ? " " So , what gives ? " Glendora confronted Jeff when the record ended . Jeff postponed the inevitable . " Let 's eat first . " Bunny arrived with our food , but she 'd obviously forgotten who ordered what or did n't see me because she put my milkshake , hamburger , and pie on Jeff 's tray . This caused much passing of plates and cutlery back and forth ; without a tray , I could only hold one dish at a time . Glendora ate very quickly , Jeff becoming increasingly nervous with every one of her bites . Finally , he blurted out , " Look , Glen , gee , I do n't know how to say this . The long and the short of it is , I 've fallen for somebody else . " He turned and looked at me quizzically , to see if I approved . I tried to turn myself into a statue so they 'd forget I was in the car , but I saw Glendora 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek . I thought she might be choking on her pie ; in fact , she set her plate back on the little outside tray and handed her untouched milkshake to Jeff . She had a fork i n her hand and it looked like a weapon ; but , amazingly , when she spoke , her voice retained its usual vigor . " Who 's the lucky lady ? " she asked . Jeff looked very uncomfortable and seemed to be stifling a belch . " You should n't take it personally . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " " To be honest , " he gulped down some coffee , " it 's just plain old ambition that 's raised its ugly head . " " Do you mind speaking plain old American ? " Glendora said huffily . " The thing is , I 've met someone who likes me . She likes me enough to want to put me on TV . " " TV ? " Glendora sounded as though she 'd never seen one . " You ca n't live here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't , and not have a bee buzzing in your bonnet that says : Would n't it be great if someone spotted you and liked your looks and wanted to put you in pictures ? " This was the most I 'd ever heard Jeff say . " It 's girls who think stuff like that , " Glendora chastised him . " Not men . " " Some men do , " he said defensively . " Who 's leading you down this primrose path ? " Glendora asked contemptuously . Jeff set his coffee cup back on the tray , perhaps anticipating that Glendora was going to hit him . " Well ... I guess you 're going to find out sooner or later . It happens to be ... Mrs. Leigh . " " Fleur 's mother ? " Glendora asked , aghast . " Charmian , " he said buoyantly as though he found it a pleasant sensation to have my mother 's name on his tongue . " Yeah , okay , I got the picture . " Glendora 's eyebrow , the one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch of skepticism . I 'd always admired her ability to express it visually . " All right , that 's it , " she said under her breath , " I 've had it . " Then she tugged the engagement ring off her fleshy finger and handed it back to Jeff . " There 's no use fighting City Hall , " she told him . " I 'll get the check , " he said . " Do n't bother , " Glendora warned him . " Bunny , Bunny , " Jeff summoned as though he were calling for help . He tapped the horn and flashed the headlights several times . " I think you better just scram , " Glendora snapped . It took Jeff some time before he understood that Glendora meant he should get out of the car . " I said , scram ! " Glendora shouted at him . Jeff reacted by giving the door a push , but before he could actually extricate himself from behind the wheel , there was a terrible clatter  --  he 'd knocked all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smashed noisily on the pavement . People in the cars around us stared at him and then hooted and honked their horns . I had to fight the giggles . Jeff 's face turned no-parking red ; he was so discombobulated he forgot to close the door . Glendora watched impassively as Jeff retreated through the messy glob of milkshake and pie , over the shards of dishes and glass . The next morning I awoke to discover Glendora 's battered suitcase sitting on top of her bed . Its lid was angled upward . No matter how Glendora leaned on it and redistributed her weight , the latch teeth would not bite . And no wonder  --  a mlange of my mother 's finery prevented their union . I could see the sleeves of a silver fox coat , the ivory satin hem of a negligee , a collar of mauve silk , and a strand of sapphires curling through the perfumed tangle . " Those clothes will look funny on you , " I told Glendora , hoping she would put them back . I did n't want her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd suffered enough as it was . " Climb up and sit on my suitcase so I can snap it shut , " she ordered . I did as I was told . Glendora threw her entire torso across one side of the suitcase lid . " Bounce a little , " she commanded me through gritted teeth as though she were instructing the suitcase how it should act . Counting three , we pounced on her suitcase together . There was a satisfying click . " Are you leaving ? " I asked . Glendora rolled her eyes at my stupidity . " What about your uniforms and your day-off clothes ? They 're still hanging in the closet . " I pressed her on this because I still hoped she wanted to stay . " They 're up for grabs , " Glendora said , raising an eyebrow and thrusting her lips . " Please do n't go , " I begged . Unbidden tears surfaced and I became the whiny , clinging , loathsome child my mother sometimes said I was . " I have no choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms from their hangers and tossed them into an immense leather satchel . Glendora had also forgotten an elaborate , manila accordion file , tied with a pink satin ribbon . This was something I coveted because inside it , folded and refolded like road maps from a long trip , were mementos of her life before us . I still remember her flower garden , photographed in black and white , with an empty swing dangling above it . Wicker rockers in a breeze had made blurs on the porch . Glendora also kept a daisy pressed in a gold-edged Bible that was bound in white leather . Her file contained paper doll cutouts from a niece , and a brown blob that was their mutt Moe as drawn by her young brother . A recipe for Scotch butter biscuits , written in her mother 's thick , fountain-penned strokes and barely contained between the lines on the card , was stapled to a let ter promising to make them as soon as Glendora came home . I was ten years old and had already noted that all nannies carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ akin to Glendora 's file . Those envelopes were the hope chests of domestics , and now Glendora had no hope . I was going to miss touching these letters and pictures as much as I would miss Glendora . Despite my longing , I reminded her , " Do n't forget your accordion file . " She moaned as she yanked out a dresser drawer , grabbed her file , held it briefly against her chest , and then placed it lovingly inside the satchel . Then she regarded me with large round eyes . " You 're a thoughtful child . You can rest assured , you do n't take after your mother . " The shutters on the tall , narrow , arched windows had been closed against the morning sun so that horizontal slats of light whittled and reshaped Glendora 's ample figure with every step she took . I watched from the balcony as she lugged her suitcase , her satchel , and a large purse down the stairs . On the landing Glendora set everything down but her satchel . Then she tiptoed across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitrine and inspected the objets d'art . She hefted and turned over in her hands all the decorative items on the coffee table . I thought this was Glendora 's way of saying farewell , but she pulled some uniforms out of her satchel and proceeded to wrap them around a small bronze bust of a milkmaid , a porcelain hunting hound , an enameled Faberg egg , the Meissen cigarette basket , and the silver Ronson lighter , as though they were kidnapped children and she was stifling their cries . My audible gasp startled her , and she looked up at me . " Glendora , that 's stealing , " I whispered . " An eye for an eye , " Glendora said . " Now , do n't be a busybody , " she warned as she wrapped and packed several more of Mother 's bibelots . She scanned the room with her big eyes and , with a furtive smile , snapped the satchel shut . I waited until she left the room before I went downstairs . Then I checked to be sure : yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear of the tagre . When I entered the kitchen , I found Glendora carefully rolling Charmian 's best silver into tea towels . " I do n't think you should do that , " I warned , picturing Glendora squeezed into one of the Beverly Hills jail cells . " A tooth for a tooth , " she said . Then she gave me a wry smile and hinted , " Right now , I 'd walk a mile for a Camel . " Smoking in the kitchen was a no-no , but this was the cook 's day off so I brought her a pack from the butler 's pantry . " Where are you going to live ? " I asked . Glendora blew an oval of smoke that looked like a visual sigh . " Be it ever so humble ... " she gave me a clue . " I think your home must be very nice , " I told her , trying to make going home seem like a prize instead of a retreat . " Your mother will make you Scotch butter biscuits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's my cue , " Glendora said . Galvanized , she stubbed out her cigarette in the sink , switched on the percolator , and picked up the phone . " Have a cab here in exactly twenty-five minutes , " she instructed Celebrity Taxi Service . " As for you , stick around and watch the chips fly , " she advised me . My mother 's good china looked diminutive in Glendora 's hands . I trailed behind her listening to the rhythmic tapping of porcelain cup against saucer as she strode through the butler ' s pantry , the dining room , and the living room . I listened for the last time to the furniture rattle . Again , Glendora did n't glance at the dark , lonely spot where the Sleekd Boy hid . She went on upstairs , kicking the tiles with her heavy feet , and crossed the balcony noisily to Charmian 's room . Once there , she knocked on the door and , without waiting for an answer , let herself in . My mother had to get up early on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't so much that she needed the analysis as that David O. Selznick had the appointment before hers . He was an important connection and this was Charmian 's way to connect . I lingered near the door as Glendora handed my mother a glass of orange juice and a red amphetamine pill . Charmian , angled on one elbow , neck straining to hold up her head , stared at us with soupy eyes and silently swallowed . Any other time of day my mother was beautiful . Glendora took the empty glass back from Mother and then plumped some pillows behind her . Leaning against them , Mother received her ritual cup of hot coffee and a cigarette lit for her by Glendora . Just because my mother was awake did n't mean she was ready to talk . While Glendora returned to the kitchen for tray number two , I ventured closer to Charmian 's side of the bed , lured there by the remnants of last night 's box of chocolates . My mother must have nibbled quite a few before her " sleep " pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found several savaged confections . They lay like wounded children with their hearts of cherry syrup and raspberry cream oozing onto their rumpled , brown , crinolated wrappers . Wishing to put them out of their misery , I devoured them . " " Mommy , " I said , knowing she did n't like me to call her that , " something 's wrong . " My mother 's eyes looked at me scornfully for , as they said in radio , a beat . Then they closed . Glendora appeared with a second , more substantial tray . On it was half a grapefruit with a silver serrated spoon by its side , a four-minute egg upended and indented in an egg cup , a crustless piece of toast already buttered , and another , fresher cup of black coffee . Glendora stood by while her cooking was silently consumed . " Mrs. Leigh , " she said softly as my mother dawdled over her egg , " I do n't want to rush you , but ... " Although I hated to miss Glendora 's explanation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those two women had stolen from each other , but I felt I 'd suffered a bigger loss . I was losing Jeff and Glendora . Why could n't I have one little thing I wanted ? I found Glendora 's luggage where she had placed it outside the breakfast room door on the flagstone steps . Her bags had heated up in the sun , and I patted her leather satchel affectionately as though it were a dog . Then I unsnapped its leather flap and pulled it open . Deep down under the shrouded artworks and silver , I found Glendora 's manila accordion file . The pink satin ribbon had come untied and it looked slightly crumpled . I extricated the file from out of Glendora 's loot , knowing full well that mine was a crime too petty to ever be dramatized on Charmian 's show . With the accordion file tucked under my arm , I hurried to find a place to stash it . On The Charmian Leigh Radio Mystery Half-Hour my mother was constantly unearthing well-concealed objects  --  my hiding place would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd once had . He 'd been a purebred Saint Bernard named Cocteau , and although my mother got rid of him because he shed , no one had ever thrown away his enormous sack of Dr. Ross dog food . It still stood on end in the service porch closet . I pulled at the string that held its sides closed and plowed my fingers through the hard , dry pellets of feed until I 'd made a deep depression . I squirreled Glendora 's accordion file down into the hole , and covered its shape with kibbles . Then I neatly closed the sack . Only when I 'd concluded this criminal activity did I feel guilty . Good riddance to bad rubbish ( or its equivalent in French ) , Charmian would say when she learned of Glendora 's departure . It would make no difference to my mother that she had been the cause . I knew it meant risking being sent to boarding school , but I wanted to compensate Glendora for all that she 'd lost and , while I was at it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  teach my mother a lesson . The house had already grown larger now that Glendora was leaving . I walked back through the kitchen , through the butler 's pantry , and into the dining room , which was two steps higher than the living room . Despite the recent plunder of decorative objects , the living room did not look bare . From where I stood , I could see the Sleekd Boy beaming his smile from out of his dark corner . I remembered my mother saying he was a priceless chef d'oeuvre , a gift she 'd given herself . For quite awhile I admired the Sleekd Boy 's exemplary silhouette . Then I slowly crossed the living room and lifted him off the shelf . I pressed his cool marble skin against my lips . I retraced my steps , caressing the Sleekd Boy once again , wanting always to remember his firmness , his density , and the smile that seemed to pervade his entire body . I held him so tight his marble flesh warmed in my hand . When I opened the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and I saw for the first time fine , glistening streaks of gold that ran through his marble flesh . Rummaging in Glendora 's satchel again , I found an extra uniform , which I wrapped slowly and meticulously around the statuette . Then I braced his swathed body between some of the other artifacts and closed Glendora 's satchel once and for all . Just as I entered the kitchen , Glendora did too . She banged down Charmian 's tray . " My swan song , " she said , then added , " If you were n't jailbait , I 'd take you along . " I followed behind Glendora when she carried her baggage out to the cab . She hardly looked at me as she climbed into the back seat , but her big , bent body spoke of dejection . Just before the taxi reached the first curve in the canyon , the window next to Glendora rolled down a crack . Her thick , ringless fingers reached over the edge and wriggled a listless good-bye .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
