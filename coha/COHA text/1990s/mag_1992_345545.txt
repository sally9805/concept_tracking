With Mardi Gras season under way , New Orleans was caught up last week in its traditional flurry of preparations for the 10-day pre-Lenten revelry . But much of the euphoria that usually surrounds the celebration has been replaced this year by anger and anxiety . Reason : an ordinance passed by a unanimous vote of the seven-member city council last December that requires the racially and sexually homogeneous private organizations that stage the carnival to stop discriminating or lose their right to parade . <P> Though the law would not take full effect until 1994 , opposition has been swift and forceful . The 60 carnival groups , known as krewes , assailed the measure as a " tragic mistake " that could drive the festival out of New Orleans . Two of the most prestigious groups , the Mistick Krewe of Comus and the Knights of Momus  --  both all white , all male  --  have announced that they will not parade , citing government intrusion . Other krewes have threatened to cancel their parades or relocate them in future years unless the ordinance is radically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orleans , which depends on Mardi Gras to pack its hotels with thousands of wild-spending tourists who help give the local economy an annual half-billion-dollar boost . <P> Because Mardi Gras is so indelibly a part of New Orleans , the debate is threatening the city 's social and cultural fabric . New Orleans now has a 62% black majority , largely because of white flight . A Times-Picayune poll last week showed that 66% of voters , including most blacks , want the ordinance repealed . The law 's chief sponsor , councilwoman Dorothy Mae Taylor , was reviled on posters and T shirts as THE GRINCH THAT STOLE MARDI GRAS . Said carnival spokesman Beau Bassich : " The law was n't needed . It tampers with a very special tradition that makes New Orleans ' appeal so unique . It is putting everybody into a no-fun mood . " <P> Some festival boosters are worried that racial tensions ignited by the debate could flare into attacks on the 30,000 participants who ride the lavishly designed floats amid crowds of onlookers . Some wives pressured their husbands not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; people are angry , " said councilwoman Peggy Wilson . " People on the floats feel like they 're going ) to be sitting ducks . " <P> Backers of the law consider it long overdue . The old-line krewes , secret outfits whose memberships are never revealed , exclude not just blacks but also women , gays , Jews and Italians . They pay only $100.25 for parade permits but enjoy full city support , including police protection and street cleanup . Proponents of the new law argue that the issue goes beyond racial discrimination during Mardi Gras . Some of the most important krewes have direct ties to such hallowed hideaways as the Boston , Louisiana and Pickwick clubs , where important business deals are often hammered out . Says Taylor : " The Mardi Gras issue is only a smoke screen . There are no crowds of blacks waiting to jump on floats , but they are waiting for a cut of the economic pie . "
