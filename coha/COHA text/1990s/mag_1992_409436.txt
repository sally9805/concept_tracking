September 1957 had been , Art Lawton recalled , a " miracle " month of muskie fishing . The muskies in New York 's St. Lawrence River had been on a feeding rampage , and Lawton along with his wife , Ruth , had been there to intercept them . The couple had taken 30 muskies weighing from 18 to 49 pounds in one week of fishing . And with hopes of catching even larger fish , the two returned one week later . Sunday morning , September 22 was an " ideal muskie day , " according to Lawton . It was cool with a hazy overcast and a slight riffle on the river just south of Clayton , New York . " We 'd been trolling about four hours when the strike came at about 11 a.m. , " Lawton wrote in an article published in the June 1958 issue of Outdoor Life . " I had him on , fighting deep , for half an hour before we saw him . All that time he did what he wanted . Then he came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't get his big belly clear of the water . " It took me an hour to subdue him and get him to the boat . When it was all over we knew he was the biggest muskie we 'd ever taken , but it did n't occur to us that he might set a new world record . " Arthur Lawton laid claim to the then-new muskie world record with that fish , which he claimed weighed in at 69 pounds 15 ounces and measured 64.5 inches . Or did it ? That was 35 years ago . On August 6 , 1992 , shortly after my submission of an exhaustive research paper on the Lawton fish , the world-record muskie was almost unanimously disqualified , on the grounds of falsification , by the review boards of both the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame ( NFWFHF ) and the International Game Fish Association ( IGFA ) . A whirlwind of controversy the likes of which the fishing world has never before seen has since followed . My investigation began about seven months ago after reading an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taken by Louis Spray in Wisconsin 's Chippewa Flowage in October 1949 . The article claimed that Spray 's 69-pound 11-ounce muskie was actually caught by a mobster , who sold it to Spray for $50 . As the director of the Sawyer County Historical Society , owner of a lodge near where Spray 's fish was caught , and a muskie fishing aficionado , I took great interest in the story and set out to investigate it . Many avenues of that investigation pointed to Art Lawton 's world-record status and the rumors that surrounded it . Ironically , and perhaps understandably to some , it was Spray himself who first raised suspicions about Lawton 's claim to the world record . After seeing a photo of Lawton 's stringer of nine muskies in a Rochester ( New York ) Times Union article , the largest of which was identified in the photo caption as the record fish with the next largest weighing 49 pounds , Spray raised questions . Citing his experience as an accomplished muskie angler , Spray alleged that " either the fish fifth from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to it did n't weigh 69 pounds . " Spray declined to contest the Lawton catch , fearing his being labeled a poor sportsman . Contest coordinators at Field &; Stream magazine , the fish-record-keeping organization at the time , had suspicions , as well , following rumors about Lawton 's fish , but they were unable to find any proof of falsification . The key to my investigation into the Lawton fish boiled down to mathematical analyses of Lawton 's muskie photos and a study done on fish markings . The key photograph ( what I call the " post photo " ) depicted Lawton standing next to the " record " fish hanging on a post . After obtaining confirmation that Lawton stood 5 feet 8 inches tall , the true length of the fish could be calculated with great accuracy ( see sidebar page 92 ) . Precise calculations from this photo reveal that the true length of the Lawton fish was between 55.1 and 55.9 inches , and that it could not have exceeded 57 inches . This is certainly far short of the 64-1/2 inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for world-record recognition . ( A letter recently discovered among Lawton 's personal effects by muskie fishing historian Larry Ramsell indicates that Lawton himself referred to the fish as measuring 55 inches . ) If the muskie in the post photo measured 55 inches , then so did the fish depicted in the official Field &; Stream photo ( a different picture ) . Marking studies show that they are , indisputably , the same fish , because markings , like fingerprints on humans , can not be identical on any two fish . The third key photo in the investigation is what I call the " smoking gun photo " ( see page 81 ) . ( Photo omitted ) This picture shows the Lawtons posing with a stringer of nine muskies . Markings on the largest fish prove it to be the same fish as in both the post photo and the official photo sent to Field &; Stream by Lawton . The nine fish were , according to Lawton himself , caught a week before his alleged world-record catch . Although I felt qualified to make a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an expert in the evaluation of vintage photographs from the University of California at Riverside ; Arthur Oehmcke , former muskellunge culturist and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources fisheries manager ; and attorneys James A. Olsen and P. Scott Hasset of the Madison , Wisconsin , law firm of ( ironically ) Lawton &; Cates . All concurred that the muskie depicted in the post photo , the muskie in the official Lawton contest photo and the largest fish in the stringer shot are the same fish . So what does this all mean ? In the smoking gun photo , which appeared with Lawton 's June 1958 article in Outdoor Life , the largest fish of the nine-fish catch is said to have weighed 49 pounds 8 ounces . Notations at the bottom of the original photograph ( enhanced in an effort to make them readable ) , which were presumably written by Lawton , also identify the fish as weighing 49 pounds 8 ounces . If this fish , according to the marking study data , is the same muskie as the one in the post and Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds 15 ounces , as Lawton claimed , but was actually the 49-pound 8-ounce muskie caught one week before Lawton claimed to have caught the world record . In addition , the girth-length-weight relationship study proves beyond a doubt and certainly to the satisfaction of the NFWFHF and IGFA that the Lawton fish as pictured in the post photo could not have possibly weighed 69 pounds 15 ounces but was rather 49 pounds 8 ounces . The accepted formula for calculating a muskie 's weight from knowledge of its length and girth is : girth ( squared ) x length/800 = weight . Although fairly accurate , I chose to apply my data from nearly 1,000 muskies to further fine-tune this formula . One formula does not work for muskies of all sizes because the bigger a muskie grows , the fatter its body grows relative to its length . Therefore , a larger divisor is required to make the formula work for heavier fish . My revised formula usually yields weights within three pounds of a muskie 's actual weight , and they are rarely more than five pounds off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum of 57 inches , knowing its girth would yield the approximate weight of the fish . To do this by the aid of a photograph , calipers must be used to determine side width ( SW ) . Through much calculating with my available data for large muskies , I 've extrapolated a formula  --  2 ( SW-1 ) +2(.58) ( SW ) = girth  --  to determine the girth . Tests on muskies with known weights indicate an accuracy within one inch . Plugging in the length of the Lawton fish ( 57 inches ) and the side width ( 9 inches ) , the muskie 's girth calculates to be 26.34 inches . Plug these numbers into my formula used to calculate weight and we come up with 48 pounds 9 ounces . Given my admitted margin of error , Lawton 's fish most probably weighed the 49 pounds 8 ounces indicated in the notations at the bottom of the smoking gun photo . WITNESSES In his affidavit submitted to Field &; Stream magazine , Lawton identified five witnesses to his catch . After considerable effort , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four of the five were , in some way , related to Lawton . Walter J. Dunn , according to the affidavit , was in charge of the weighing , and personally measured the Lawton fish . However , when I contacted Dunn ( who is not related to Lawton ) he said that he did not weigh or measure the fish and did not know who did . He then signed a notarized statement to that effect . The evidence is quite overwhelming that Lawton 's muskie catch was falsified . Both the IGFA and the NFWFHF have elected to disqualify the Lawton catch . THE NEW NO.1 ? Although the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame has decided to recognize the Louis Spray fish as its new ( old ) world-record holder , the International Game Fish Association has dubbed a 65-pound muskie caught by Toronto angler Kenneth O'Brien as its " temporary " world record . O'Brien 's huge muskie was taken from Ontario 's Georgian Bay and is the largest caught anywhere in more than 25 years . Had the fish been taken in the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have weighed as much as 78 pounds . O'Brien and two friends were actually fishing for walleyes when the big fish struck his Countdown Rapala . In fact , O'Brien had never even seen a muskie before October 16 , 1988 . To say that they were poorly equipped to handle a fish of that size is an understatement . O'Brien was using a light Fenwick rod , Mitchell spinning reel and eight-pound-test Trilene line with a short , four-inch-long wire leader . Just 15 minutes after it struck , the 58-inch muskie appeared on the surface . O'Brien was shocked at its size and knew immediately that their landing net would be useless on the fish . The anglers had luckily brought along a gaff . The first attempt was fruitless , but with O'Brien 's buddy , Mark Aristone , on gaff for the second attempt , they brought the fish into the boat . POST PHOTO CALCULATIONS The post on which the Lawton muskie is hanging can measure the length of his muskie as accurately as a ruler , as long as the length of the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that determination . In the " post photo , " when straight lines are extended off the roof and base lines of the house and off its siding as well , they will all converge on the vanishing point and on the true horizon . This determines the camera level , which is at Lawton 's shoulders . If the level of the camera rose about a foot , to the same level as Lawton 's head , the laws of perspective dictate that the top of the post must drop slightly in relation to the top of Lawton 's head . Even without compensating for the lower camera angle , the top of the post is , at most , three inches above the top of Lawton 's head . But when perspective is allowed for , we know that the post is , at most , between two and three inches longer than Lawton 's height . Any inconsistencies in the lawn surface are considered inconsequential to these calculations . The post can be no longer than 70 or 71 inches . This is based upon Lawton 's height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taller than Lawton ( two or three inches ) = 70 to 71 inches . Because the muskie is hanging on and touching the post , this 70 to 71-inch post now acts as an accurate measuring device . By measuring the total length of the post ( down to ground level ) and the length of Lawton 's muskie off the post photo with a caliper , the actual length of the muskie can be calculated by using a simple ratio . These precise calculations put the length of the fish between 55.1 and 55.9 inches long . SPRAY SUSPICIONS With the Lawton muskie disqualified by both the International Game Fish Association and the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame , next in line for consideration for the world 's record was a 69-pound 11-ounce muskie landed by Louis Spray in 1949 . Controversy swirls around this catch , too , beginning with long-time rumors that Spray never actually caught the fish . An article last year in the Chicago Tribune introduced allegations that Spray purchased the muskie from a Chicago mobster with ties to Al Capone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fame dismisses such reports as ugly rumors and claims that Spray 's unsavory reputation is nothing but a smear . " Nobody knew Spray as well as I did , " he adds . Kutz emphasizes that the fish was witnessed by a number of people and weighed on a certified , postal scale . Suspicion is not easily dispelled , however , because records indicate that the Spray muskie was taken in the Chippewa Flowage near Hayward , Wisconsin , home of the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame . The Chippewa Flowage is home also to the Indian Trail Resort , belonging to John Dettloff , whose investigation of the Lawton fish led to its disqualification and whose investigation of the Spray muskie helped ensure its new ranking . In a recent article in Musky Hunter magazine , Dettloff claims that Spray lied about where he caught his fish . Spray always insisted he caught the muskie on Fleming 's Bar , but Dettloff argues that he caught the fish at Graveyard Point , less than a half-mile , coincidentally , from Dettloff 's fishing resort . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dettloff says he 's not out for personal glory or financial gain . ' Actually , it 's a detriment to my business because it 's caused me to neglect some of my resort duties . I do n't need a cheap publicity stunt to stay afloat . ' " At any rate , the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame has reinstated the Spray fish as the new world 's record . IGFA has thus far refused to recognize the Spray muskie , however , as it turns out that the fish was hooked on a rod and reel but killed with a gun . " It was shot not once , " notes IGFA president Mike Leech , " but several times . " In fairness , shooting muskies was the traditional way of landing them 40 years ago . Bob Kutz of the National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame explains that it was legal at the time to shoot muskies before landing them . " Most of the fish were shot in those days , " he observes . So , at this point , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muskie as the world record . The IGFA recognizes as the world 's record a 65-pound muskie caught by Kenneth O'Brien in Ontario 's Blackstone Harbor in 1988 . However , Leech notes , " We will be looking at the evidence regarding three heavier muskies . " Next in line ? A 68-pound 5-ounce fish landed by none other than the now deceased Ruth Lawton , Art Lawton 's wife . Stay tuned . <p>
