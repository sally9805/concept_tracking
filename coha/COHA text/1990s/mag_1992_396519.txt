His man is on the March in Georgia , but on this gray Washington , D.C. , afternoon , political consultant James Carville is holed up in " the bat cave "  --  a musty basement apartment on Capitol Hill . With Super Tuesday fast approaching , Bill Clinton 's spin doctor is immersed in political alchemy  --  trying to turn fence sitters , naysayers and disaffected defectors into Clinton voters . Working the phones , scheduling TV spots and parsing speeches , Carville is doing what he does best  --  planning surprises for the opposition . " We 've proven very adept at crisis management , " drawls Carville , 47 , who recently guided Clinton through a couple of political alligator pits . Now , he says , he wants to " create " em for some other people . " Possessed of a bare-knuckle , confrontational style , Carville has been hailed as the Democrats ' Lee Atwater . " Fightin 's fightin ' ' , " says the consultant , who helped spike Bill Scranton 's 1986 gubernatorial bid in Pennsylvania with a hard-hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hippie wanting to " bring transcendental meditation to state government . " When disaster struck Clinton in the form of Gennifer Flowers and of the candidate 's ROTC letter , Carville and company counterattacked aggressively . After falling 15 points in some polls , Clinton finished just eight points behind Paul Tsongas in New Hampshire  --  establishing himself as the " Comeback Kid . " " He 's probably the first person on the Democratic side in a long time who spooks the Republicans , " says Carville 's friend , pollster Peter Hart . A man with a golden gut , Carville has an occult ability to plumb voters ' deepest fears . " I 'm a little like a piano player in a whorehouse , " says Carville , who often walks the aisles of discount stores trying to gauge the mood of the electorate . " Somebody out there hums something , I try to pick it up . " A bachelor who favors jeans and high-tops and watches reruns of The Andy Griffith Show , Carville is an eccentric , by his own admission . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disconnect . Yet my whole ability to earn a living depends on my ability to connect with other people 's everyday lives . " Willing to sacrifice almost anything for his career , he has agreed with girlfriend Mary Matalin , 38  --  political director of Bush 's re-election campaign  --  to put their relationship on hold until November . " I still think very highly of her , " he says wistfully . " She 's obviously very important to me . I like her a lot better than I like her politics . " The public first picked up on Carville last November , when he engineered Harris Wofford 's stunning upset of Republican Richard Thornburgh in the Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race . Wofford started out as a 44-point underdog ; Carville and his partner , Paul Begala , were able to turn that into a 10-point victory  --  and a wake-up call for George Bush  --  by playing on economic fears , anti-Washington sentiment and the desire for national health insurance . The opposition credits Carville with deceptive charm and an unerring instinct for hitting the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enables him to operate this way , " says Thornburgh 's campaign consultant , Greg Stevens , who claims that Carville unfairly blamed his client for " the mess in Washington . " Says Stevens : " He really is entertaining . Funny . But mean as a junkyard dog . " Although Carville asserts that he never told the Clintons how to portray their relationship on 60 Minutes , it has been reported that he lobbied for discretion  --  advising them to acknowledge the Governor 's infidelity implicitly but to withhold details because of what Hillary would call a " zone of privacy . " Yet behind Carville 's clear-eyed tactical maneuvering is a strong emotional attachment to his candidate . While Bill and Hillary Clinton were taping the 60 Minutes segment in a Boston hotel , Carville was moved to tears . " Sometimes you 're a consultant , and sometimes you 're a human being , and I was a human being then , " says Carville . " I have genuine affection for these people . I told the Governor , " You know , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for free . ' " An unlikely candidate for the role of kingmaker , Clinton 's key adviser is a " quintessential country kid " from the hamlet of Carville , La. , named for his paternal grandfather . The eldest of eight children born to the town postmaster and a mother who had once taught school , he spent his childhood riding horses , reading the encyclopedia and serving as an altar boy in the chapel at the noted leprosarium nearby . Entering LSU in 1962 , Carville " drank , chased a lot of coeds and got into a lot of fights . I made John Belushi look like a scholar , " he says . Invited to leave , he spent two years in the Marines , then taught junior high while he was finishing his degree . In 1970 he entered LSU 's law school but was bored after graduation when he went to work for a law firm in Baton Rouge . Says his mother , Lucille , 73 : " He was the worst lawyer in the world . " His true vocation emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city judge appointed Carville her campaign driver . Galvanized by politics , he joined a group of local media consultants in 1980 . The early years were tough : He toiled for losing senatorial candidates , briefly joined Gary Hart 's 1983 presidential campaign and lived from paycheck to paycheck . At 40 , he said he was a " stoned-ass loser " who had to sell his life-insurance policy " to keep the VISA people from lynching me . " The turnaround came in 1986 , when Carville was interviewed by Democrat Bob Casey , who was making his fourth bid for Governor of Pennsylvania . As Carville has told it , Casey hired him because he , too , was a loser . When Casey won , Carville said , " It was the best night I 've spent so far on this planet . " Although he now pulls down about $250,000 a year , Carville sees himself as a political gun for hire : He 'll work for anyone as long as they are " Democrats ... not bigots ... and not crooks . " Even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the specter of failure . Superstitious and obsessive , he has been known to wear the same underwear in the last days of a winning campaign , lest he turn the karmic tide . Even now , the consultant of the moment telephones friends up to a dozen times a day to obsess about the details of the Clinton campaign . At this point , he wo n't speculate on his chances for victory . " I do n't want to jinx anything , " he says . " There 's an old saying : A statesman looks to the next generation . A politician to the next election . And me ? I just look to the next tracking poll . " <p>
