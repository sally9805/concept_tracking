<p> Getting Clyde Drexler to talk about himself is about as difficult as getting him to dribble with his head up . <p> Head down and all , Drexler can see the court just fine - and in his vision is his first NBA championship . Even with the Houston Rockets leading the Orlando Magic 3-0 in the NBA Finals , Drexler is n't about to say or do anything to let it get out of focus . <p> " This is a golden opportunity for me , " says Drexler , who was languishing in Portland last season when the Rockets were winning their first championship . " I like to let my play speak for itself . You just do the best you can , and if you 're fortunate enough to be on a team that has a chance to win it all , then that 's great . I have that opportunity , and I 'm trying to do all I can to make that a reality . " <p> He 's doing plenty , averaging 20.7 points , 6.9 rebounds and 4.9 assists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 6.3 assists in the Finals against the Magic . <p> " I 've said from the beginning that Hakeem ( Olajuwon ) carries that team , but the Rockets right now are getting their energy from Drexler , " says Brian Hill , Orlando 's coach . " Clyde is huge . He has his mind made up that his team is not going to lose . We ca n't do anything to slow him down . " <p> The Rockets can win the series with a victory Wednesday at The Summit . <p> Four months ago , however , they were looking at each other wondering why management would trade a valuable player like Otis Thorpe , a strong rebounder and interior defender , for the smaller , older Drexler . <p> " I think everyone was uncomfortable at first , because we had won a championship with Otis , " guard Kenny Smith says . " We knew what we had . We knew Clyde was a great player , but great players do n't win championships all the time . " <p> Drexler knew some people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unselfish attitude , such an explosive game and such a positive , team approach , that his new teammates could n't help but like him . <p> It also did n't hurt that coach Rudy Tomjanovich thought it was a move the team had to make . Or that Olajuwon , the Rockets ' best player , and Drexler have been best friends since playing together at the University of Houston , where both appeared in the 1983 NCAA title-game loss to North Carolina State . <p> The rest was up to Drexler . <p> " I did n't realize the unselfishness he played with , " Smith says . " His speed and his defensive ability also surprised me . His reserved mannerisms and his unselfishness are the two things that stick out most , though . " <p> Where once were skeptics galore now are only supporters . Drexler has won over his teammates and the city of Houston and gained his opponents ' respect . <p> Thorpe was one of Houston 's most popular players and did n't want to leave the Rockets . He 's back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the games . Friends say he 's happy for the team , but it 's painful not to be part of it . Everyone understands , however , that it takes a player of Thorpe 's caliber to get a Drexler . <p> " Clyde 's one of the most respected players in the league , " Tomjanovich says . " He 's always classy and sets an example for the other players . If that was n't all in place , I never would have made the deal . <p> " We did n't make the trade knowing what was going to happen during the season , but if we did n't make it , I do n't know if we would have even made the playoffs . " <p> Drexler is the kind of player fans love to root for . He 's polite , courteous and approachable . He 's so considerate , in fact , that he wo n't even throw a towel on the floor after a timeout ; he 'll hand it to the trainer or a ball boy . <p> He came into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped so high and floated through the air so easily on his way to a spectacular dunk , and also because it rhymed with Clyde . He once won a contest by dunking on a basket that was 11 feet , 1 inch . <p> Now , nine days short of his 33rd birthday , Drexler still can be spectacular when it 's necessary , but most of the time he 's nuts and bolts . He 's the type of player whom no one has to tell what to do . He knows and does it without fanfare . <p> " He 's always positive , " teammate Mario Elie says . " All he ever wanted from the day he came was to fit in , and that 's what he 's done . We would n't be here without him , and now we all want to win it for him . " <p> Perhaps Drexler 's most impressive plays of the Finals came with Sunday , with 2 : 06 left in Game 3 and the Rockets leading 96-94 . Shaquille O'Neal missed a jump hook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He took off upcourt , head down of course , and dribbled past Anfernee Hardaway and Nick Anderson . With only Dennis Scott to beat , he faked to the right . Scott almost fell down , and Drexler glided in for a dunk and a 98-94 lead . <p> " I do n't know of any other player in the league , maybe Michael Jordan , with the energy to make a full-court play like that , that late in the game , " Tomjanovich says . " You can talk about age all you want , but there is something special there . " <p> What 's the real story behind Drexler keeping his head down while he dribbles ? <p> " I do it to gather more speed , " he says , " but I can still see where everyone is on the court . The more speed you gather , the tougher you are to contend with . I 've been doing it for a long time . I know it looks funny , but . . .
