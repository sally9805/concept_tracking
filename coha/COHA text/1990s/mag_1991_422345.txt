Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS While many women believed Thomas , others felt betrayed  --  and are gearing up for a new political fight <p> Dateline : Washington ; New York ; Chicago <p> There were too many inconsistencies in her story ... I think women are scheming little creatures . TABLE <p> She has no reason to lie and he has every reason to lie . Thomas was playing the sitcom " angry man . " TABLE <p> After modern history 's nastiest Supreme Court confirmation fight came a close last week , new justice Clarence Thomas declared it was now " a time for healing . " But that wo n't be easy . Anita Hill 's testimony opened wounds in the deepest parts of America 's collective psyche , revealing divisions of class and race as well as gender . Polls found that a majority of the women surveyed ( as well as a majority of the men ) did not believe Hill 's story . Still others saw the episode as powerful proof that women 's grievances will never be taken seriously in a male-driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cultural war for a long time , and it will get uglier before there 's a resolution , " says Faye Wattleton , president of Planned Parenthood and a Thomas opponent . <p> While America searched its soul , politicians looked for ways to capitalize on the forces unleashed by the Senate hearings . The White House expertly exploited the divisions ( page 26 ) while Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee , says Vicki McLennan , chief lobbyist for Georgia 's National Organization for Women , acted like " a bunch of possums caught in the headlights . " Betrayed by the Democrats and alienated from the Republicans , women 's groups last week issued a new call to arms and threatened to unseat senators who voted to confirm Thomas . <p> Feminists have long disputed the charge that they are out of touch with the concerns of average women . But the willingness to believe Hill 's testimony seemed to divide along class lines . While a Los Angeles Times poll found no significant differences among working and nonworking women , education and professional standing proved a cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmation , compared with 19 percent of nongrads . Nothing expressed that schism better than the testimony of J. C. Alvarez , Thomas 's assistant at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . Alvarez portrayed Hill as an ambitious , arrogant careerist , while she herself came across as Everywoman . Many working-class women simply could n't believe that Hill would tolerate sexual harassment . " A lot of women out there are quite comfortable telling a guy to knock it off , " says Suzanne Fields , a conservative columnist for The Washington Times . Hill " had all these privileges . They could n't believe she was a shrinking violet . They rejected her as a victim . " <p> Man-haters ' : In a sense , the decision about whom to believe depended on whether the listener wished to see Thomas on the court . For some blacks who looked forward to the appointment of one of their own , Hill 's testimony created a loyalty test . Thomas himself turned up the heat when he accused the Senate of a " high-tech lynching " and suggested he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see black women as aggressive man-haters , and black women are sensitive to that image , " says Diana Hayes , an assistant professor of theology at Georgetown University . In a poll of her black women students , Hayes found an even split between those who felt their primary allegiance was to Thomas as a black and those who believed women should be protected from sexual harassment . Even among Americans who believed Hill , there were those who thought it was unfair to derail Thomas with decade-old charges . <p> Ultimately , Hill became a contestant in a prime-time popularity contest she could n't win . The professor delivered her testimony in a dispassionate , lawyerly way ; Thomas 's fiery delivery may have drowned out Hill 's message . " The absence of emotion makes people suspect , " says Thomas Kochman , author of " Black and White Styles in Conflict . " Viewers who found Hill utterly credible themselves were not necessarily surprised that so many women accepted Thomas 's version of events . Defense lawyers in rape cases are often eager to have women on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Columbia University School of Law and a former sex-crimes prosecutor , " many women tend to be more judgmental about the purported victim than men . " <p> Enraged and embittered , liberal women plan to use the events of the last week to inspire long-term changes in the political process . " What women have realized is that we 're politically homeless , " says Wendy Kaplan , a Boston lawyer who specializes in sexual-harassment cases . Women disgusted by the way-both Democrats and Republicans behaved during the hearings may now feel disenfranchised , but that attitude could leave them out in the cold . Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter would be a prime target for liberals , but so far his only Democratic opponent in the ' 92 race is the state 's right-to-life lieutenant governor . Georgia Sen. Wyche Fowler , who antagonized liberals when he voted aye last week , will also most likely face a conservative candidate . " The choices are to vote for a right-wing conservative or sit out the election , " says Alan Abramowicz , a political scientist at Emory University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Feminists have periodically concluded that their only hope lies with a women 's political party . Last week activists again tried to rally the sisters , but it 's unlikely such plans will come to fruition . Instead , women candidates from the main parties could become the big winners . " Their fundraising base just got a shot in the arm , " says Democratic activist Ann Lewis . Political strategists agree that the Thomas proceedings intensified anti-incumbent sentiment in the country-and that women will be able to turn it to their own advantage . Because they are political outsiders , says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake , they can present themselves as " part of the solution , not part of the problem . " <p> Meanwhile liberal activists are determined to make Thomas 's supporters feel their pain . Last week direct-mail specialist Roger Craver canceled his contract with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to protest chairman Charles Robb 's pro-Thomas vote . But political episodes , however searing at the time , have a remarkably short shelf life . So while angry women turned up at rallies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , " it is not clear who actually will remember or what lessons they will take away from the Hill-Thomas hearings . Women have never viewed social issues as a monolith , and they have n't voted as one either . <p> PHOTO : Women have realized we 're politically homeless ' : Anti-Thomas rally at the Capital , Professor Hill/CARTER-U.OF OKLAHOMA  --  SIPA <p> PHOTO:LARRY DOWNING  --  NEWSWEEK <p> PHOTOS:A choice between gender and race : Demonstrating in Thomas 's behalf , the new justice with wife Virginia/ CRANDELL  --  PICTURE GROUP ( INSET ) , DOWNING  --  NEWSWEEK <p> By ELOISE SALHOLZ <p> With ELEANOR CLIFT , PATRICK R0GERS , KAREN SPRINGEN and HOWARD MANLY <p>
