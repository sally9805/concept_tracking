BECAUSE THEY HAD DRUNK a whole bottle of wine , whose name made her think of the Irish jigs danced by her addled aunts and made him think of leg of lamb  --  a bottle that cost more than the rest of the picnic even there in Saint-Remy  --  and because their small daughter was racing circles one direction then the other around them anyway so they could n't just roll about together and enjoy the lassitude and heightened senses poured with that sort of bottle , and because they had been warned and all three had rain gear and baby Margaret 's was a brilliant red slicker , when it began to drizzle in the sunny world of Provence they did n't mind at all but began to wander in a sort of walking siesta , slowly and separate , toward things that made them curious : Ben with his camera toward the isolated arch and mausoleum called The Antiques , and Iris , sometimes leading and sometimes following her daughter , toward a great building in disrepair , like a monastery with all the monks gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meter and the stone monuments , focusing and unfocusing his various lenses , but Iris just wandered along , letting things come in her eyes and exit into her brain with no idea whatsoever of taking responsibility for what they did there . <p> Their exclamation point ever on the move , baby Margaret extended this sense of pleasure , hopping around and gathering snails in the gray light like a redbird picking seeds in the Virginia woods  --  where they were not . Decidedly not . They were exotics , like the last cardinal Iris had seen  --  caged along with bluebirds and robins in Paris , at a vendor 's on the Quai de la Megisserie . Appalled , she had suddenly realized that maybe parakeets and canaries were also birds that missed their trees and grass . Margaret , however , had the grace and good fortune to be all over the trees and grass and in general all over and into everything  --  a fact that did n't sit well with the French , who really did think cardinals could live in cages and children hold still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her errands , watching busy Margaret vaguely until something , usually physical ( setting sun , rising hunger , traffic or anger ) , intervened and she would pick the child up and they would set off together in some new direction . <p> Some of the shutters on the abandoned building hung from their hinges , and its door stood ajar . Where the steps used to be there was a gangplank of sorts . Iris , who had been in France long enough to notice that , in general , people there closed their doors firmly against the world , felt this was an explicit invitation . It was as massive a door as any recluse could wish to shut behind him , and old , like the rest of the building  --  like the rest of the country  --  though not as old as the Roman monuments Ben wanted to photograph . ( Iris briefly glanced over her shoulder toward where he had disappeared with his camera . She did n't see him , but he must have flushed a flock of black birds  --  crows or magpies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threat , or were they just there  --  black , moving marks in the air ? ) <p> Margaret started up the trestle boards , and Iris let her go , trusting her baby adroitness . Of the two , Iris was more likely to stumble , though it would n't have been much of a fall into the damp grasses anyhow . There were not even traces of stone steps to fall on ; someone had taken them away . <p> Inside , the empty hall went both left and right in the soft red geometry of Provencal tiles . In one direction it had the feeling of a ruin fallen open to the sun and stars and now today 's drizzle , but it was covered against the wet sky in the direction chosen by Margaret . The tiles and empty spots where some were gone seemed almost to have been swept . Iris followed Margaret , who increased her speed at the sight of the long corridor ahead . <p> " Slow down ! " called Iris . Margaret laughed and perhaps slowed immeasurably in the echoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that echoed off . " Have you come for the tour ? " The voice , after the first burst of greeting , was raspy and old . Iris spoke French minimally but workably . She relied on the word " ah ... " because , though she was usually pretty sure what the other person intended , she often could n't find the words for what she had in mind to say . Now this language struggle was going to insert itself , impeding her exploration of the building 's invitation . The languid pleasure , the slow passion of curiosity , was turning into something else . <p> " Ah ... " she said , then : " There 's a tour ? I have no money . What is the price of admission ? " <p> " If you do n't take a tour , you wo n't know what you should know . The child would be free in any event . " The man looked like he did n't make much money at this occupation . His uniform was an old black suit , shiny where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be for " He has no meat on his bones . " " Under the age of twelve , " he added , to show there were rules . <p> " Is there a twenty-centime tour ? " Iris asked , remembering the coin in Margaret 's slicker , though she knew she might have trouble getting it away . <p> " Ludicrous , " said the man . At least that was Iris 's preferred translation . She steered clear of soundalikes such as " ridiculous " because she had had a good deal of bad experience with false friends  --  those French words that did n't mean at all what they ought to . <p> " I can get some money from my husband after the tour , " she offered . It seemed the same part of her mind that had to struggle to speak ( the part somewhere between puzzles and mazes ) knew it could be useful to imply a strong arm ready to flex in her defense  --  just in case . <p> " No , madame , for you it will be free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . " <p> " Ah ... " said Iris politely , wondering if that meant her precautions were justified because he was a dirty old man . But he seemed quite frail  --  not one to violate or ( Iris had a good literary euphemism for it ) work his will on anyone . " You are very nice . " To the extent possible , she kept her eye on Margaret , who clearly intended to run in and out of every room that lined the hall ahead of them . <p> " Love for the great painter who was here when I too was a child . " <p> " Ah ... " said Iris , and called to Margaret to slow down or come back or something . <p> " I did n't have a beautiful red waxed coat like that for the rain , " he said , as if this were part of the story . <p> Iris was focused on Margaret now . It was a beautiful slicker , catching the minimal light entering the corridor through the doors leading off it . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " It could be dangerous . " <p> A cardinal . Or a little bloody gash ... " I 'll get her , " said Iris , suddenly protective . " It 's easiest . " <p> She caught the scampering Margaret and held her firmly by the hand . " You can have a candy later , " she promised as a replacement for the pleasures of running and throwing echoes . " A sucette . On va parler francais maintenant . " Margaret was disappointed , but was placated with the small hope of a sweet . <p> " The tour will begin with the window , " said the man . <p> Iris had to ask a question . She knew it was going to turn out to be a stupid question , but she had to ask anyhow . " Which great painter lived here ? " she asked . <p> " Oh , madame , " said her guide . He pulled a dingy hand-lettered card from his pocket and passed it to her , but kept his hand out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOGH , she read . <p> He seemed so wounded . Iris had n't meant to cause him pain . She tried to explain her lack of knowledge by a faulty education ; over the past year this had usually appeased any Frenchman offended by her ignorance . " In school , " she said . " They did n't teach us lives . We saw a lot of pictures , and I 've seen some in museums , but I never learned anything about the lives of painters . " <p> He was satisfied with her inadequacy and ready to begin . " This was the next-to-last home of Van Gogh , " he said . " The great genius had himself brought here in the worst of distress after the whole story with his ear and the harlot and his friend Paul Gauguin , a fine but inferior painter . " <p> Iris remembered pictures now : Gauguin 's earthly paradise inhabited by Tahitian women , the suffering eyes of Van Gogh 's self-portrait with the bandaged ear , and the light in some of Van Gogh 's landscapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stood in it herself . " I thought maybe he lived in Arles , " she said . <p> " He was in Arles when he cut off his ear . He came after that , and my sister was working in this hospital when he came . She brought me here after blessed Maman died at the birth of my baby sister , the little angel who also died , and Papa of course had long been gone , and though we had other relatives , Sister was almost completely in charge of my upbringing . She had to scrub the floors and the walls and the tubs and the stinking chamberpots she had already had to dump , but there was food here  --  the same chickpeas , beans , and lentils delivered on a perfect schedule to the patients , no more or less moldy . We had a bed here because she did it , all that . Now I could sleep in the doctor 's grand study if I pleased . Dr. Peyron , the great man . My sainted sister . She had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name without adding some uncharitable comment . She saw him as filthy , a drunkard , a man with bad habits . She thought the doctor should prescribe the tub more often . But to me he glowed with kindness and , above all , genius . <p> " He let me sit beside him in the garden while he painted the olive trees or the irises or the paths around the building , and the great doctor said I was good for him . There were benches where the other patients sat . He had a little stool . I helped by screwing the black tops back on the silver tubes of paints so the color would not be wasted . He was very frugal . His brother and another friend in Paris would send him the canvas and the paint he needed , and he knew he was causing them great expense just by being here . He told me how bad he felt ; he himself was poor as we , and sometimes he would get in such a terrible state they would have to put him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you want to see the window first , or the tub ? It is the other way to the baths , and I believe your daughter has already chosen the window , so we will follow her . " <p> Iris liked that in the man . Her experience in this country had led her to believe that if a child chose one thing , the attendant adult was required to choose the opposite . <p> They went down a corridor illuminated by the daylight coming through open doors and blindless windows in the rooms . Then they slowly climbed a staircase that had been carefully but spottily repaired . Iris grabbed Margaret 's hand again , holding it until they finally reached their destination over dilapidations of the upstairs floor that Iris would have thought tile was incapable of attaining . Monsieur Charbon went to the only closed door and opened it for them . " Ah , now the window , " he said . Here the floor seemed solid , and she and Margaret stood waiting for him to unclasp the glass panels , pulling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed his hand through bars to a second latch , opening the shutters , once again cared-for and silent . <p> " What do you see ? " he asked . Iris moved closer and looked out . She saw bars and she saw fog  --  neither the right answer , she knew . So she put off her response by leaning down to pick up Margaret . " Birds , " said Margaret , pointing at the sky . <p> " Crows , " said Monsieur Charbon . " Wasteful and cruel . They tear out the young wheat . " <p> The flock of black birds ( the same ones flushed by Ben , still groundless ? ) veered down the center of the frame . Margaret had not been answering the man , just remarking as she sometimes did , using words as solid objects the way a painter takes pigment from a tube . It was still up to Iris to respond correctly . The fog was not really so drastic , merely drizzle thickening and stacking against the blue forms of one of the trees they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graveyards , providing dense evergreen shade when the sun was bright and breaking the unrelenting wind that whistled down the Rhone valley . " Let me see . . . " she said , stalling . <p> " Yes , take a hard , hard look . Surely you have seen it before , unfurling like a blue peacock 's tail , " said her guide . He grew impatient then , and gave her the answer . " It is the great cypress standing in a wheat field . And the same one as Starry Night . " <p> It was certainly not that , thought Iris . There was no sign of wheat fields , or any intentional growth . Only an eddy of tangled brambles lay between the window and the tree . And the sky ! a half-daylight  --  no stars . No sun even , no gusty blue wind to whip up the black flames of the cypress she remembered from the museum in New York . The tree out the window had been deprived of its reality by the flattening drizzle . <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Madame , " said the old man . " If you could imagine wilder you too would be a great painter . " <p> Who 's to say I 'm not , thought Iris . And then looked at herself in her mind 's eye and realized that she was obviously just any old Mummy with any old baby in a red slicker and had never even tried to paint and had really not " imagined it wilder " so much as sort of felt Van Gogh 's scene would not be the one she was seeing if it was even a real place at all . She knew no appropriate words for any of this in French , so she just nodded politely and said , " It 's very beautiful . " <p> Monsieur Charbon was satisfied and now proposed they view the baths . Iris prepared herself for this by remembering the only bathtub she knew of in the history of art  --  the one in which Marat died and where David painted him : Death of Marat . Very pale skin . Dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could only remember it in black and white . But there must have been at least the color red to remind you that the death was violent . <p> " One more glance , " said the old man . " The child will remember it always . " Margaret , who was standing on the deep sill , looked silently through the bars at whatever she saw and whatever she might remember . " I will lift down the pretty baby , " he said . Before Margaret could register dissatisfaction , she was on the ground next to her mother , and Monsieur Charbon had turned to close the shutters . <p> He led them down the stairs again and to the far end of the building . Almost all the doors stood ajar , but they came to another room with a closed door , which he opened for them to peek into . It was just a large , dark , empty space with papers piled in the corner . " I could live here now , " he said . " In the study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the archive . I live where I have always lived , and I will show you when we have seen the baths . " <p> Monsieur Charbon carefully closed the great doctor 's door and led them a few doors down to a room lined with tubs and exposed plumbing . " You must imagine the water , " he said . " And the madmen tied down to keep them in . Sister would sometimes ask me to help her sit on them so she could tie their arms . But I never sat on the great artist . Ah no . They put him in this very tub until his raging subsided and brought on the terrible , melancholy calm . He was more wretched than ever , and he could not paint then either . He was happy when he painted  --  never a madman in those moments . He did not mind my being beside him in his worst times , because he was never suspicious of me as he was of the others . Though once , in his last long attack , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to eat them and die . And the kerosene . I filled his lamp and locked it out of reach , but he grabbed the whole bottle from me to take a swig . Sister knocked it to the floor . You could not tell if the wildness led to the sadness or the other way around . He was a determined man when he was wild and so wretched when melancholy . I used to bring him the small black olives that he loved . They were easy to steal from the kitchen when I was doing chores for Sister , and I wrapped them in a corner of the brown paper they had been sold in at the market . Once , in this tub , he untwisted the oily paper and thanked me , making a little joke of his usual sad words . ' My son , ' he said , ' think how those twisted trees bear such a lovely fruit and how it must be soaked and soaked in herbs and brine . And do you think I will leave this bath a lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ? ' He thought he was an old man , and I was a child scarcely older than your baby so I thought so too , but now I know what is old , and he was not this . Each olive , before he ate it , he turned against the light to see how its perfect shape had changed to something strange and better . Madame , do you like our olives ? " <p> " Yes , " said Iris . " I like them . But Margaret , my baby , adores them . " She could see that Margaret was getting fidgety and that cranky was next . A few olives might be the solution . <p> " When we go to the museum I shall give you some that will be the best you ever tasted . But not for babies . For her I have a sweet . It is approaching snack time , and we should go down to the museum before the afternoon light is gone . " <p> " This is not the museum ? " asked Iris . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he explained . <p> Just moving back and forth in the vast building had taken a long time already , but Iris followed along , and so did Margaret , who had perked up when olives were mentioned but even more so when she heard the familiar word for something sugary . " Sucette , Maman ? " she asked , and Iris whispered to her that she did n't really know what it was , maybe a bonbon . She could tell by the way Margaret was dragging alongside that if the bonbon were the wrong color , there might be trouble . <p> They went through the old kitchen , where a pile of wood tumbled around a sooty stove that seemed to give off heat . Stairs led down into a sort of cave , and Margaret became interested again , poking her finger in the stone crevices . Light from the kitchen 's outside door lit the way and followed them down . At the bottom the old man looked about and said , " Too dark already ; I 'll light the lamp . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sides of the room and whitewashed rock on the other two . Against one stone wall was a pile of bedding ; against the other was a table and chair . The shelves were mostly empty , except for a few dishes up high and maybe clothes , maybe rags . Tacked to one of them , however , was another of the official cards : MONSIEUR CHARBON . MUSEE VAN GOGH . Iris had to bend to see what was on the shelf , and Margaret began to reach into the space , in search , perhaps , of the promised treat . " No ! " Monsieur Charbon said rather sharply . " Do n't touch . They are mine . He left me these . " There were nine or ten flattened silver tubes . " The paint from these tubes is in famous pictures that are far away now ; though when I was young I saw him make them . I would sit beside him with brown paper from the market , or scraps he 'd thrown away , and draw with a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little nub of charcoal . ' That is my name : Charbon . But this is my great prize from his hand when he left . " On the shelf there was a long black twig . <p> " Vrai charbon : real charcoal , " said Iris , knowing how much that must have meant to the little boy whose name it was . " But you have never used it . " <p> " Oh no , Madame , not charbon . I was Charbon , I had charbon . This is fusain . This is the real vine charcoal , the artist 's tool . See how perfect it is , how smooth . " <p> She should have known she would not get the word right . She said nothing . <p> " No , I have never used it . I am not an artist . I am a poor old man . It is my treasure , " said Monsieur Charbon . " Now you have seen the museum . Please sit down , and I shall give you some olives . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She felt it was very late , and she imagined Ben might get worried if he ran out of film . <p> " Madame , " he said , offended once again . <p> " Perhaps just one or two then , " said Iris , taking a seat on the only chair . <p> " And I have a pretty surprise for your little girl , " he said . " I was saving it for my supper , but with her red waxed coat she makes the day bright for an old man , and so I shall give it to her . " <p> " Oh , you are being too nice , " protested Iris , painfully aware of how much they had had for their picnic and how much they would have for their supper and how much the next day and the next . " You really must n't . " <p> Margaret looked expectant , and he handed her a small ceramic pot of some sort of pudding . Iris could see the milky skin on the top and feared the worst . Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowl up onto the table and said , " Sucette , Maman ? " <p> " Taste it , " said Monsieur Charbon . " Here is a spoon . You must taste it . It is very good for you . It is my own supper . " <p> Margaret stood firm . " Sucette , Maman ? " she asked again . <p> " How about an olive ? " asked Iris . <p> " No , " said the old man . " She must eat the pudding . Babies do not eat olives . She is very very rude . " <p> Iris stood up to go and take away her rude baby . <p> " No , Madame , sit down . The child must learn . What are these manners , you bad bad American baby ? " <p> Margaret squirmed away from Iris , who said to Monsieur Charbon , " She is very tired . If we leave her alone a few minutes I 'm sure she 'll behave better . These olives are delicious . " <p> Monsieur Charbon was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could look up into the light coming down the stairs . The sun seemed to be coming out enough to make shadows . He chewed on an olive and spat the pit carefully into a bit of paper . Iris politely held her pits in her hand , not wanting to further disgrace herself , her family , or indeed her country . Margaret had retreated in blessed silence somewhere behind her mother . <p> There seemed to be plenty of olives , but Iris took them very slowly , trying to gauge by their number when it would be possible to leave . At first she thought five and then maybe seven or eight . At nine she looked over her shoulder at Margaret and registered with horror that she had the caps off several of the silver tubes and was biting on one to see what was in it . Margaret saw her looking and dropped the tube quickly , spinning her arm around to put her head on the shelf and pout in guilty denial . There was a clatter of little separate objects . <p> There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those belonging to the museum , and Monsieur Charbon , alarmed , began to raise himself painfully from the mattress on the floor . Iris went straight to Margaret and grabbed her hand , but she herself stepped on the precious black twig that her child had already snapped in two . " My god , " she said . " I 'm so sorry . " <p> " Go away , " he said , sitting down again . " Go away . You understand nothing . You are both big Americans who violate everywhere and understand nothing . " <p> " I am so sorry , " said Iris again . But she knew being sorry was ludicrous . It would never be enough to mend the museum . She knew she meant to understand , but maybe she did n't . <p> From the top of the stairs she looked back down and saw their shadows on him . " Go away , " he said . " Go away . You are crows . Crows . " <p> <p> By Betsy Wing <p>     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
