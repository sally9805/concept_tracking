<p> Genetic engineering will be essential to feed the world 's billions . But could it unleash a race of " superweeds " ? No one seems to know . And nobody 's in charge of finding out . <p> A few miles outside sacramento , several large greenhouses sit behind a fence . In the summer the familiar heads of sunflowers are visible through the glass and in the fields surrounding the greenhouses . The plants are tall , straight and healthy , with thick leaves that reach for the California sunlight . They look exactly like sunflower plants grown throughout the United States  --  except for the plastic cages around each flower . <p> The flowers are covered by biologists at Pioneer Hi-Bred 's research facility in Woodland , Calif. , which owns the greenhouses , the fields around them , and the sunflowers in both . The plants are transgenic  --  that is , genes from other organisms have been inserted into their chromosomes . Caging the sunflower heads helps prevent the breeze from wafting genetically engineered pollen around the area , which would violate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To protect Pioneer 's trade secrets , the researchers are chary of discussing their work , but government permits suggest that the sunflowers in Woodland have been subjected to the full armamentarium of contemporary biotechnology . Pumped up by genes from as many as a half a dozen other species , the plants repel moths and viruses , fight off fungus diseases , and produce seed with a shelf life beyond that of their nonengineered cousins . To Pioneer , these super-sunflowers , as they are sometimes called , will be a small but significant step forward in the struggle to feed the world 's exploding population , which is projected to level off at 10 billion or so . But to critics , they  --  and the agricultural biotechnology that created them  --  are an ecological menace that will wreck the natural systems on which human life depends . <p> The battle between these entrenched views is fierce . In the last year , farmers and activists ruined five metric tons of transgenic seed in France , trashed fields of genetically altered crops in Germany , and convinced seven European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This February , a coalition of 70 groups and individuals sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to block the use of a dozen transgenic crops as an " imminent " threat to the environment . <p> Even as the U.S. government promotes agricultural biotechnology , European countries are backing away from what activists call " Frankenfoods . " Austria and Luxembourg have banned genetically modified corn ; Norway has also outlawed the corn as well as five other biotech crops ; France has prohibited all transgenic plants . To push the British government to enact a moratorium , Greenpeace dumped four tons of genetically modified soybeans outside 10 Downing Street in February . <p> Biotech 's supporters , on the other hand , argue that it will create nothing less than a second Green Revolution . In the first , agricultural scientists used conventional breeding techniques to create the high-yielding strains of wheat and rice that have doubled world grain harvests since the 1950s . During that time the number of hungry people fell by three-quarters , according to the U.N . Food and Agricultural Organization , despite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise , and researchers now must do it all over again . According to a projection released last August by the International Food Policy Research Institute , a think tank in Washington , D.C. , world demand for rice , wheat and maize will increase 40 percent by 2020  --  and the only way to feed those mouths is through biotechnology . If activists succeed in banning transgenic crops , argues Robert L. Evenson , an agricultural economist at Yale University , they will end up " hurting the poor of three continents . " <p> Caught between these extremes is a group of agricultural ecologists and plant geneticists who are trying to understand the implications of the new technology . Although some activists claim genetically altered crops are a direct threat to human health , researchers generally dismiss such fears : There is little evidence that transgenic genes , in and of themselves , are likely to be toxic or promote disease . However , biologists do believe that in some cases foreign genes in crops can pass into other , nonagricultural species , with potentially dangerous effects . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says ecologist Joy Bergelson of the University of Chicago . " That does n't necessarily mean that there will be negative repercussions . But there could be some . And right now we do n't know enough about what they could be and when they could occur . " <p> " The technology is brilliant " says Paul Arriola , a plant geneticist at Elmhurst College , in Elmhurst , Ill . " In many respects , it 's a godsend . " Nonetheless , Arriola believes biotech is outpacing both the scientific understanding of its risks and the development of a regulatory apparatus to supervise its use . Because , in Arriola 's view , " we do n't really know what to regulate , or how to do it , " the world is in the middle of " a huge , ongoing experiment . We could create a real environmental mess . And that could stop this technology from doing some real good . " Superweeds <p> The fight over transgenic farming is anything but academic . In 1996 , the first year transgenic seed was widely available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of the new varieties . This year , according to Clive James , head of the nonprofit International Service for the Acquisition of Agribiotech Applications , as many as 50 million hectares worldwide  --  an area bigger than Germany  --  are planted with genetically modified crops . " It 's one of the fastest adoptions of technology I 've ever seen , " James says . <p> About three-quarters of that land is in the United States , most of it planted in bioengineered corn and soybeans . But the technology is growing even faster in Argentina  --  the area the country devoted to transgenic soybeans tripled between 1997 and 1998 . Although exact figures are not available , China , the world 's biggest producer of cotton and tobacco , is , according to James , " aggressively increasing " the land planted with genetically altered versions of both crops . <p> By far the most important bioengineered trait today is herbicide tolerance , which accounts for two-thirds of all transgenic crops . A technology dominated by Monsanto , it lets plants withstand the use of selected weed-killing chemicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroying their crops . Monsanto 's " Roundup Ready " soybeans , which resist the company 's Roundup herbicide , were introduced in 1996 ; last year , they covered an estimated 10 million hectares  --  a third of the U.S. farmland devoted to that crop . Next in importance is insect-resistant corn , including DekalBt corn , modified by Monsanto 's recently acquired Dekalb subsidiary to produce a bacterial insecticide , and StarLink corn , produced by AgrEvo , a joint venture of German chemical giants Hoechst and Schering . Principally aimed at fighting off the European corn borer , transgenic corn last year occupied 6.5 million hectares in the United States  --  a fifth of the nation 's total corn crop . <p> More  --  much more  --  is on the way . As sales of bioengineered seeds rose from $75 million in 1995 to more than $1.5 billion last year , half a dozen huge companies in Europe and the United States positioned themselves to exploit a market that is widely believed to be on the verge of exploding . According to U.S. Department of Agriculture records , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , more than 1,000 in the last year alone . About 50 have already been approved for unlimited release , including 13 varieties of corn , 11 tomatoes , four soybeans , two squashes , and even a type of radicchio . Hundreds more are in the pipeline , among them plants that will produce industrial and pharmaceutical chemicals ( see " The Next Biotech Harvest , " TR September/October 1998 ) . <p> This rush to market alarms some biologists , who believe transgenic crops are being released before the environmental implications are understood . The most immediate worry is whether genetically engineered crops will spontaneously breed with their wild relatives , creating hybrid " superweeds . " Just as a single Brazilian bee researcher created a continent-wide nuisance by accidentally letting aggressive African bees hybridize with gentle domestic bees , the release of alien genes could , in theory , produce noxious " killer-bee " plants . <p> Surprisingly little is known about such natural hybridization , explains plant geneticist Norman C. Ellstrand of the University of California at Riverside . Until recently , agricultural scientists focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in the past primarily concerned the introgression of genes from the wild into cultivated species , rather than the other way around . " People had the idea that crop-weed hybridizations was n't a very common or interesting phenomenon , ' Ellstrand says . " But when they finally got around to looking at it , they basically spent a lot of time being surprised at what could happen . " <p> Initially , scientists thought genes were unlikely to flow from transgenic crops to weeds , because known crop-weed hybrids are often sterile . But last September , Bergelson and two Chicago colleagues startled researchers with a study of Arabidopsis thaliana , a mustard species often used as a test organism by plant geneticists . Usually , the plant pollinates itself , implying to scientists that foreign genes in transgenie A. thaliana would not escape by hybridization . But after the researchers planted ordinary A. thaliana , transgenic herbicide-resistant A. thaliana , and a naturally occurring , herbicide-resistant mutant variety , they learned that the transgenie plants were 20 times more likely to outcross than the mutants  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal Nature put it . " Nobody knows why " Bergelson says . " We 're still trying to find the mechanism that drives the pattern we saw . There 's a lot we do n't understand , including how common it is . " <p> The implications are ominous . A decade ago , for instance , European sugar beets spontaneously mixed with a wild relative , creating a hybrid species that is now a continent-wide problem . Whereas the sugar beet is biannual  --  the root is harvested at the end of the second year  --  the new weed is an annual . At the end of the year , Ellstrand says , " the root turns into a chunk of wood that damages farm equipment or gets into the sugar-beet processing plant and screws up the machinery . You ca n't kill it with an herbicide because any herbicide that gets the weed hits its relative . It 's not until the thing blooms and flowers that you see it , and by that time it has set seed that gets into the beet field forever . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar problems . The prospect of herbicide- or insect-resistant superweeds is particularly dismaying . In 1995 , Monsanto and AgrEvo introduced herbicide-tolerant oilseed rape ( Brassica napus ) , the plant that is the source of canola oil . One year later , all 11-member team from the Scottish Crop Research Institute reported , to scientists ' surprise , that pollen from oilseed rape fields can travel as much as two kilometers . At almost the same time , three Danish geneticists discovered that transgenic Brassica napus readily breeds with a weedy relative , Brassica campestris . The resulting plants look much like B. campestris  --  but are unaffected by herbicides . Taken together , says Dean Chamberlain of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro , the two reports " showed that hybridization is a real concern and that you need a very large buffer area around your plot to control it . " <p> When Ellstrand reviewed the literature on the 30 most agriculturally important plant species , most scientists he consulted believed few hybridize easily . In fact , he found evidence that more than 25 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species . Included in that list is wheat , which Robert S. Zemetra and his colleagues at the University of Idaho reported in April can outcross with bearded goatgrass , a problem weed in the western United States . <p> " What really shocks me as a biologist is that you have two species with different numbers of chromosomes hybridizing , " says Allison Snow , a botanist at Ohio State . " Goatgrass has 28 chromosomes and wheat has 42 , but they can cross . " Biologists have regarded viable off-spring from such mismatches as almost impossible . As a result , they thought the range of species that could hybridize was limited . The goatgrass-wheat hybridization suggests that the range is bigger than had been thought . <p> " You get very low rates of reproduction , " Snow says . " But when you 're talking about acres and acres of wheat with goatgrass all around them , even a very low probability event can occur . " If hybridization created insect-resistant goatgrass in areas where the weed 's spread is naturally con ! rolled by insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only kind of goatgrass you have , and then you might end up with even larger infestations of it than we already have . " Such fears are one reason that insect-resistant Bt crops  --  which contain genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis-have been targeted by activists . <p> In the United States , transgenic corn is unlikely to pose much risk of hybridization because it has no close relatives . But Mexico has teocinte , the wild plant that may be the ancestor of modern corn . What would happen if Mexican farmers planted bioengineered corn ? Could the new genes affect the fitness of teocinte , which some agricultural ecologists view as a potential storehouse of valuable genes for future corn breeders ? " With the information we have now , " Snow says , " it 's hard to tell when the long-term risks are serious enough to ban certain crops . " <p> Looming behind the ecologists ' fears is the belief that molecular biologists who work with DNA on the laboratory bench do n't understand fully how it behaves in the field . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Institute of Virology and Environmental Microbiology , " The risk assessment of transgenie organisms is a multidisciplinary subject , which should include ecologists , molecular biologists , agronomists and sociologists . " Instead , companies tend to delegate decisions about the release of transgenic crops to molecular biologists  --  who are not trained to appreciate the full complexity of how the genetic code interacts with environmental factors . <p> " How fast would a new weed get around ? " Snow asks . " Nobody really knows . I 'm sort of assuming that most of these crops will be approved eventually and people like me will study what the consequences are . Then , after the cat is out of the bag , we may figure out how to regulate this technology . " A Hungry World <p> Given these risks , why do so many of these scientists support the continued development of agricultural biotechnology ? One answer is witchweed . Witchweed , the common name for three species in the genus Striga , is a parasitic plant that feeds on the roots of cereals and legumes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the continent 's three most important cereal crops  --  Striga , in the view of Gebisa Ejeta , an agronomist at Purdue University , is a " scourge " of African agriculture . It has been estimated that the weed destroys 40 percent of the continent 's total cereals harvest  --  a staggering loss in the world 's hungriest places . <p> From a biological perspective , Striga is fascinating . Its seeds , smaller than grains of sand , lie dormant for as long as 20 years , waking only when aroused by a chemical emitted by the roots of the host plant . While still underground , the parasite plants develop root-like organs called haustoriums , which penetrate the host roots and siphon nutrients . Scores or hundreds of Striga plants can attack the same host . Witchweed eventually grows into fields of five-foot-tall plants with pretty pink flowers , but by that time it has long destroyed the crops it feeds on . Because each plant produces as much as 100,000 seeds , witchweed is almost impossible to eradicate  --  the United States spent four decades wiping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because witchweed rapidly adapts to new hosts , losses in Africa keep growing . When the parasite made it impossible to grow sorghum in eastern Sudan , desperate farmers tried to grow pearl millet . At first millet was immune . But within a few years witchweed was wreaking havoc on the new crop , too . " People are literally starving because of Striga , " says Ejeta . <p> Ejeta and several other Purdue scientists have spent years trying to breed varieties of sorghum that produce low levels of the chemicals needed to germinate Striga . But parasite-infested cropland has such dense concentrations of fallow seeds that even the improved varieties can be " overwhelmed " according to Fred Kanampiu , an agricultural researcher in Kenya for the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center , a Mexico-based laboratory that is usually known by its Spanish acronym of CIMMYT . " The solution is obvious , " Kanampiu says . " Herbicides kill witchweed . But unless we can engineer herbicide-resistant sorghum , the herbicides also kill the crop . " <p> Another " obvious " example of the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan Gressel of the Weizmann Institute 's Department of Plant Genetics in Israel . The common name for several parasitic species in the genus Orobanche , broomrape  --  the name , Gressel says , comes from its effects on a legume called broom  --  plagues vegetables , sunflowers and grain legumes throughout the Middle East . Like its cousin Striga , Orobanche produces tens of thousands of tiny seeds that lie dormant , ruining all attempts at planting the land . " The seeds are the size of talcum powder , maybe 50 cells per seed " Gressel says . " How they can live for 20 years is beyond me . " Methyl bromide , the only available treatment , is expensive , not terribly effective and toxic . " The activists want to ban biotech and herbicides and have farmers pull out the weeds by hand , " he says . <p> According to economists , witchweed and broomrape epitomize the most important potential targets of agricultural biotechnology : the problems of farmers in developing nations . " At first blush you look at this technology and you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers , " says James of the International Service for the Acquisition of Agribiotech Applications . " It 's proprietary , so farmers have to buy seed they now get for free , it 's developed by industrial countries , so money flows from the poor to the rich  --  it must all be ill-suited for developing countries . But when you look at it carefully , the specs of the technology allow you to fit almost exactly what the small farmer needs . " <p> The original Green Revolution crops depended heavily on irrigation , artificial fertilizer and chemical pesticides . By contrast , James says , the fruits of bioengineering are encapsulated in " the simplest technology of all  --  the seed . " Pest-resistant seed corn , for example , needs no costly spraying equipment , is not very complicated to grow , and releases little toxin into the environment . Because poor countries often owe their poverty to bad soils or lack of agricultural water , James believes they will disproportionately benefit from bioengineered crops that can grow in barren land or stand up to drought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of their budgets on food , " says Evenson , the Yale economist . As a result , he argues , productivity increases from transgenic crops will not mean much to Europe or the United States . " We can afford to throw away the technology  --  it 's a luxury for people who already have enough to eat . " The situation is different for the destitute . " In some places , " Evenson says , " you can get Food being more than 75 percent of people 's budgets . In rice-based areas , you 'd have half of that being on rice . So if rice prices are 20 percent higher than they would otherwise be , it 's not a small thing . " Last October , he presented a model that , among other things , projected an increase in global malnutrition from stopping biotechnology for 10 years . The exact tally of the starving , he says , " depends on the assumptions , but they are never something to ignore . " <p> " What really bothers me is the increasing opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Per Pinstrup-Anderson , director-general of the International Food Policy Research Institute . Although some activists believe their the potential side effects make transgenic research unethical , Pinstrup-Anderson argues that the ethical considerations cut both ways . " It 's probably more unethical to withhold solutions to food problems that cause children to die , " he says . " I do n't want to be melodramatic but there are several hundred million hungry people in this world . " <p> " Biotech will be a contributor in the future to increasing yields enough to make the world 's food supply keep up with population growth , " says Stephen Padgett , a chief agricultural researcher at Monsanto . " It wo n't do the job alone , but it 's a crucial part of the effort . " Even in the best of circumstances , though , making Padgett 's predictions come true will not be easy . <p> India , for example , initially embraced the new techniques . With the active support of the state , half a dozen Western firms set up collaborative research projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts , Mahyco , the nation 's biggest seed company , joined forces with Monsanto to develop insect-resistant cotton  --  India is one of the world 's leading cotton producers . High-intensity cotton farming is notoriously risky to the environment ; in India , according to C.S. Prakash of the Tuskegee Institute 's Center for Plant Biotechnology , the crop covers just 5 percent of the agricultural land but accounts for 50 percent of the country 's insecticide use . <p> Yet the initial tests in India of cotton bioengineered to resist bollworm caused violent controversy . As a rule , farmers license , rather than own , the seeds for transgenic crops . For this reason , they are not allowed to save the seed from one year 's harvest to plant in their fields the next year . Critics both inside and outside India argue that this removes one of the foundations of rural agriculture , forcing smallholders into colonial dependence on rapacious multinationals . The companies respond that the increased yield and decreased costs from biotech will more than make up for the price of the seed each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big companies think the benefits do n't outweigh the costs . In the early 1990s , Pioneer Hi-Bred  --  then the world 's biggest seed company , now a subsidiary of DuPont  --  developed exactly the kind of transgenic , herbicide-resistant sorghum that could fight off attacks of Striga . Then Arriola , the Elmhurst geneticist , demonstrated in 1996 that sorghum easily hybridizes with Johnson grass , a weedy relative that has become an ecological pest in the United States since its accidental introduction from Africa in the mid-1800s . The hybrids , fertile and vigorous , looked very much like Johnson grass . <p> Because herbicides are almost the only successful means of eradicating Johnson grass , an herbicide-resistant strain would have a major selective advantage . " It would spread , " Arriola says flatly . " It could create huge losses . " The findings , he says , surprised the molecular biologists ; fearful of inflicting ecological damage in North America , Pioneer soon stopped working on transgenic sorghum  --  postponing the day , perhaps , when Africa can feed itself . <p> " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But how do you look somebody in the eye and say we are not going to develop this crop and feed these people today because we might create some tong-term problems in the future ? Maybe transgenic sorghum is so risky that everyone knows it just is n't worth it . But how do we make that decision in other cases ? " Who 's Watching the Greenhouse ? <p> The uncertainty is due , in part , to the lack of a rigorous regulatory framework to sort out the risks inherent in agricultural biotech . The plastic cages covering the heads of the sunflowers help keep the transgenic pollen out of the environment , a general requirement for obtaining a federal permit to grow a test crop of bioengineered plants . But other than monitoring the plots , the government imposes few conditions on biotech tests . The main reason is that Congress has not passed any specific environmental law for genetically engineered agriculture . Instead , transgenic crops are evaluated by three overlapping federal agencies : the Food and Drug Administration , the Environmental Protection Agency , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different statutory responsibility , which sometimes leads to anomalies  --  and gaps in regulations . The FDA , for example , does n't look at the safety of foods that have been engineered to express pesticides , because pesticides are by law exempt from the agency 's purview . Nor does the EPA , which is required to treat such foods as pesticides . Because pesticides , of course , are toxic substances , the agency only establishes human " tolerances " for each compound . ( Responding to critics ' concerns , the agency announced this spring that it may rethink its approach . ) For its part , the USDA simply tries to make sure that the crop grows in the way that the manufacturer says it will . The disjointed legal mandates , observes EPA biotechnology adviser Elizabeth Milewski , " make life interesting . " <p> One worrying consequence of this patchwork of regulations is that no one has direct responsibility for looking at long-term effects on the environment . " We have a first-approximation understanding of the population biology of these plants and the insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a biologist at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro . " But we know very little about the community ecology and virtually nothing about the ecosystem ecology of what these genes will do . And we are not pursuing this knowledge actively . " Stewart 's concerns bore fruit in May , when Cornell scientists reported that pollen from Bt corn can kill the caterpillars of monarch butterflies . <p> According to Sally McCammon , science adviser to the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service , biotech field trials can be of any size and last for any length of time , though one or two years is the standard . From the companies ' point of view , the tests are efforts to learn whether new crop varieties will perform as intended . The government 's main job , McCammon says , " is to certify that the test is biologically contained . " Transgenic plants must be kept apart from plants they might cross-pollinate . " Afterwards you have to account for it , " McCammon says . " We make sure that you bag what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under . " <p> These measures are necessary , to Snow 's way of thinking . But by ensuring that transgenic genes wo n't escape into the environment , they also make it impossible to learn what will happen if they do . " The ecological questions do n't even get touched , " she says . " In fact , it 's illegal to touch them . " She believes that the environment and industry would be better served by introducing a second level of testing devoted to ecological questions . Another step , in her view , would be to fund academic research into the ecological hazards  --  currently the sole source of federal funds , the biotechnology-risks panel of the USDA , has a budget of less than $2 million . <p> Technical controls may also be possible , says Gressel of the Weizmann Institute . Most transgenie crops today have a single foreign gene . But companies are already working on inserting several genes simultaneously into the plant 's genome . In a May article in the journal Trends in Biotechnology , Gressel argues that if these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the chromosome , potential hybrids would inherit all of them at once . And if the secondary genes coded for traits such as preventing dormancy , the hybrids would be less , not more , dangerous than their wild parents . For crops , the inability to lie dormant does n't matter , because the seed is harvested and replanted each year . But a weed that is unable to produce seed that can remain dormant until an opportune time to germinate is at a significant disadvantage . " The hybrid weed will be weaker , not stronger " Gressel says . <p> " I 'm more worried about the future than the present , " Ellstrand says . " So far it 's okay  --  we do n't have killer tomatoes flying through the air . But we need to be thoughtful and careful about what we 're doing , and there are some people and some portions of the industry where they have a better tradition of that than others . People who have worked with plants outside in real life seem to have a better handle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . If we keep paying attention to what 's happening in the field , we might be able to make this technology realize its promise . " <p> By Charles C. Mann <p> THE TERMINATOR TACKLES SEED PIRATES <p> " I 've had some of my Chinese postdocs ask for a few seeds of transgenic soy to take home to their families , " says Neal Stewart a biologist at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro . " I never know what to say . " <p> For years , biotechnology companies have worried about transgenic soy plants slipping out of their control . Farmers who plant bioengineered crops agree not to save their seed for next year 's planting , making them customers for next year 's batch of genetically engineered seeds . But even in the United States , where intellectual property rules are strong , such arrangements are widely ignored , despite companies ' use of " seed police . " In China , the biotech firms fear , " seed piracy " could be rampant . <p> In the spring of 1998 , a technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ germinating , but does n't otherwise affect the plant . Referred to by anti-biotech activists as " Terminator technology , " the technique was developed by a U.S. Department of Agriculture researcher and backed by Delta and Pine Land , a leading seed company now owned by Monsanto . <p> To companies , the Terminator is the biotech equivalent of copyprotection : a technological means of preventing seed piracy . Moreover , if Terminator genes were packaged with other transgenie traits , they could help ensure that cropweed hybrids would be sterile  --  potentially eliminating a difficult problem ( see accompanying story ) . <p> Critics see it differently . Farmers have been saving seed for millennia . To those concerned for rural welfare , the Terminator seems like a way to slip a noose around the neck of poor farmers . Fearing farmers in developing countries would become dependent on faraway corporations , the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research , a network of international agricultural laboratories , declared in December that it would oppose introducing seed-sterility genes to developing nations . <p> Meanwhile , researchers have developed a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Terminator II . " Astra Zeneca , for one , has developed a version that in theory can not grow and germinate unless farmers use certain chemicals from the company . Also under development are transgenic plants whose natural defenses against pests can be switched on and off by chemical signals , which would also be purchased from the company . This strategy is intended to conserve the plants ' resources by turning the defenses on only when they 're needed . But such " junkie plants " are disturbing to some opponents of agritech because their normal functioning depends on synthetic chemicals . <p>
