 | " Is there something you 'd like to tell me before I help you up onto that horse ? " he asked her . " Some warning , maybe ? " " Thou art brave , Sir Kalten , " she replied . " It 's what they pay me for . " He shrugged . " Will I dissolve if I touch you ? " " No . " " All right . You 've never ridden a horse before , have you ? " " We do not keep horses . We seldom leave our valley , so we have little need of them . " " They 're fairly nice animals . Be a little careful of the one Sparhawk rides , though . He bites . Now , this horse is a pack animal . He 's fairly old and sensible , so he wo n't waste energy jumping around and being silly . Do n't worry too much about the reins .

You 'll get used to it after a few days  --  if we 've got that far to travel . " She held out her hands , crossed at the wrist . " Wilt thou bind me now , Sir Knight ? " " What for ? " " I am thy prisoner . " " Do n't be silly . You wo n't be able to hold on if your hands are tied . " He set his jaw , reached out , and took her by the waist .

I 'll be right beside you , so if you feel yourself starting to slip , let me know . " " We always underestimate him , " Vanion murmured to Sparhawk . " There 's a lot more to him than meets the eye , is n't there ? " " Kalten ? Oh , yes , my Lord . Kalten can be very complicated sometimes . " They rode away from their fortified cave and followed the gorge the river had cut down through the rock . Sparhawk and Vanion led the way with Kalten and their hostage riding close behind them . Sephrenia , her face coldly set , rode at the rear with Berit , keeping its much distance as possible between herself and Xanetia.  | " Is it very far ? " Kalten asked the pale woman at his side . " I mean , how many days will it take us to get there ? " " The distance is indeterminate , Sir Kalten , " Xanetia replied , " and the time as well . The Delphae are outcast and despised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley of Delphaeus widely known . " " We 're used to traveling , Lady , " Kalten told her , " and we always pay attention to landmarks . If you take us to Delphaeus , we 'll be able to find it again . All we 'd have to do is find that cave and start from there . " " That is the flaw in thy plan , Sir Knight , " she said gently . " Thou couldst consume a lifetime in the search for that cave . It is our wont to conceal the approaches to Delphaeus rather than Delphaeus itself . " " It 's a little hard to conceal a whole mountain range , is n't it ? " " We noted that selfsame thing ourselves , Sir Kalten , " she replied without so much as a smile , " so we conceal the sky instead . Without the sun to guide thee , thou art truly lost . " " Could you do that , Sparhawk ? " Kalten raised his voice slightly . " Could you make the whole sky overcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Vanion . " I could n't . Maybe Sephrenia could , but under the circumstances it might not be a good idea to ask her . I know enough to know that it 's against the rules , though . We 're not supposed to play around with the weather . " " We do not in truth cloud the sky , Lord Vanion , " Xanetia assured him . " We cloud thine eyes instead . We can , an we choose , make others see what we wish them to see . " " Please , Anarae , " Ulath said with a pained look , " do n't go into ton much detail . You 'll bring on one of those tedious debates about illusion and reality , and I really hate those . " They rode on with the now-unobscured sun clearly indicating their dine of travel . They were moving somewhat northeasterly . Kalten watched their prisoner  --  or captor  --  closely , and he called halts nmewhat more frequently than he might normally have done . When they stopped , he helped the strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they continued on foot , leading their horses . " Thou art overly solicitous of my comfort , Sir Kalten , " she gently chided him . " Oh , it 's not for you , Lady , " he lied . " The going 's a bit steep here , and we do n't want to exhaust the horses . "  | " There 's definitely more to Kalten than I 'd realized , " Vanion mattered to Sparhawk . " You can spend a whole lifetime watching somebody , my friend , and you still wo n't learn everything there is to know about him . " " What an astonishingly acute perception , " Vanion said dryly . " Be nice , " Sparhawk murmured . Sparhawk was troubled . While Xanetia was certainly not as skilled is Aphrael , it was clear that she was tampering with time and distance in the same way the Child-Goddess did . If she had maintained the illusion of an overcast sky , he might not have noticed , but the position of the sun clearly indicated that there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not normally jump as it moves across the sky . The troubling fact was not that Xanetia did it badly , but the fact that she did it at all . Sparhawk began to revise a long-held opinion . This " tampering " was obviously not a purely divine capability . Itagne 's rather sketchy discourse on the Delphae had contained at least some elements of truth . There was indeed such a thing as " Delphaeic magic , " and , o far as Sparhawk could tell , it went further and into areas where Styrics were unable or unwilling to venture . He kept his eyes open , but did not mention his observations to his friends . And then , on a perfect autumn evening when the birds clucked murmured sleepily in the trees and a luminous twilight turned the mountains purple around them , they rode up a narrow , rocky trail that wound around massive boulders toward a V-shaped notch high above , Xanetia had been most insistent that they not stop for the night , and she and Kalten had pressed on ahead . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and her protector reached the top of the trail , they stopped and sat their horses , starkly outlined against the last rosy vestiges of the sunset . " Dear God ! " Kalten exclaimed . " Sparhawk , come up and look at this ! " Sparhawk and Vanion rode on up to join them . There was a valley below , a steep , basinlike mountain valley with dark trees shrouding the slopes . There were houses down there , close ? packed houses with candlelighted windows and with columns of pale blue smoke rising straight up into the evening air from innumerable  | chimneys . The fact that there was a fair-sized town this deep in the Inaccessible mountains was surprising enough , but Sparhawk and the others were not looking at the town . In the very center of the valley , there was a small lake . There was , of course , nothing unusual about that . Lakes abound in mountains in all parts of the world . The spring runoff from melting snow inevitably leeks valleys and basins  --  any place that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no exit channel . It was not the fact hat the lake was there that was so surprising . The thing that startled hem and raised those vestigial hackles of superstitious awe along the cks of their necks was the fact that the lake glowed in the lowering ilight . The light was not the sickly , greenish glow of the phosphoscence that is sometimes exuded by rotting vegetable matter , but was stead a clear , steady white . Like a lost moon , the lake glowed , rending to the light of her new-risen sister standing above the eastern orizon . " Behold Delphaeus , " Xanetia said simply , and when they looked her , they saw that she , too , was all aglow with a pure white light at seemed to come from within her and that shone through her rment and through her skin itself as if that pale , unwavering light ere coming from her very soul .  | Sparhawk 's senses were preternaturally acute for some reason , although his mind seemed detached and emotionless . He observed ; he heard ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not an unfamiliar one , but the circumstances under which this profound calm had come over him were unusual  --  very unusual . There were no armed men facing him , and yet his mind and body were preparing for battle . Faran tensed , bunching his muscles , and the sound of his steelshod hooves altered very slightly , becoming somehow more crisp , more deliberate . Sparhawk touched the big roan 's neck with one hand . " Re-lax , " he murmured . " I 'll let you know when the time comes . " Faran shuddered , absently flicking his master 's reassurance off like a bothersome insect and continuing his cautious pace . Vanion looked at his friend questioningly . " Faran 's being a little sensitive , my Lord . " " Sensitive ? That ill-tempered brute ? " " Faran does n't really deserve that reputation , Vanion . When you get right down to it , he 's a good-natured horse . He tries very hard to please me . We 've been together for so long that he knows what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his way to match his attitude to mine . I 'm the one who 's the ill-tempered brute , but he gets all the blame . He behaves like a puppy when Aphrael 's riding on his back . " " Are you feeling belligerent just now ? " " I do n't like being led around by the nose , but it 's nothing specific . You 've overtrained me , Vanion . Any time anything unusual  | tomes up , I start getting ready for war . Faran can feel that , so he does the same . " Xanetia and Kalten were leading them across the meadow that sloped down toward the glowing lake and the strangely alien town nestled on the near shore . The pale Delphaeic woman still glowed with that eerie light . The radiance surrounding her seemed to Spar-hawk 's heightened senses to be almost a kind of aura , a mark more of special kind of grace rather than a loathsome contamination . " It 's all one building , did you notice that ? " Talen was saying to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distance , but when you get closer , you start to see that the houses are all connected to-gether . " Khalad grunted . " It 's a stupid idea , " he said . " A fire could bum out the whole town . " " The buildings are made of stone . They wo n't burn . " " But the roofs are thatch , and thatch will burn . It 's a bad idea . " Delphaeus had no separate wall as such . The outermost houses , all interconnected , turned their backs to the world , facing inward with t heir windowless rear walls presented to the outside . Sparhawk and the others followed Xanetia through a large , deep archway into the city . There was a peculiar fragrance about Delphaeus , a scent of new-mown hay . The streets were narrow and twisting , and they frequently ran through the buildings , passing under heavy arches into vaulted corridors that emerged again on the far side . As Talen had noted , Delphaeus was all one building , and what would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The citizens did not avoid their party , but they made no particular effort to approach . Like pale ghosts they drifted through the shadowy maze . " No torches , " Berit noted , looking around . " No need , " Ulath grunted . " Truly , " the young knight agreed . " Notice how it changes the smell of the place ? Even Chyrellos always reeks of burning pitch  --  even in the daytime . It 's a little strange to be in a city that does n't have t hat greasy smoke clinging to everything . " " I do n't think the world at large is ready for self-illuminating people yet , Berit . It 's an idea that probably wo n't catch on  --  particularly in view of the drawbacks attached to it . " " Where are we going , Lady ? " Kalten asked the pale , glowing woman at his side . Kalten 's situation was a peculiar one . He guarded  | and protected Xanetia . He was solicitous about her comfort and wellbeing . He would , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first sign of hostility from her people . " We go to the quarters of the Anari , " Xanetia replied . " It is he who must place our proposal before Anakha . Anakha holds the keys to Bhelliom , and only he can command it . " " You could have saved the rest of us a lot of trouble and made this trip alone , Sparhawk , " Talen said lightly . " Maybe , but it 's always nice to have company . Besides , if you had n't come along , you 'd have missed all the fun . Look at how entertaining it was to jump off that cliff and lounge around in midair with about a thousand feet of absolute emptiness under you . " " I 've been trying very hard to forget about that , my lord , " the boy replied with a pained expression . They dismounted in one of those vaulted corridors near the center of the city and turned their horses over to several young Delphae . The young men looked to Sparhawk like goatherds who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowing woman to a dark-stained door , worn with centuries of use . Sparhawk , still in the grip of that emotionless calm , looked carefully at Xanetia . She was not much bigger than Sephrenia , and , although she was clearly a woman and quite an attractive one , that fact somehow had no meaning . Xane-tia 's gender seemed irrelevant . She opened the worn door and led them into a hallway with deeply inset doorways piercing the walls at widely spaced intervals . The hallway was lighted by glass globes hanging on long chains from the vaulted ceiling , globes filled with a glowing liquid  --  water drawn from the lake , Sparhawk surmised . At the far end of the corridor , Xanetia paused in front of one of the doors , and her eyes grew distant for a moment . " Cedon bids us to enter , " she said after a brief pause . She opened the door and , with Kalten close behind her , she led them into the chambers beyond . " The hall of Cedon , Anari of the Delphae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that seemed to be one of the characteristics of her race . Three worn stone steps led down into the central chamber , a tidy room with vaulted ceilings supported by low , heavy arches . The slightly inwardly curving walls were covered with white plaster , and the low , heavy furniture was upholstered with snowy lamb 's wool . A small fire  | horned in an arched fireplace at the far end of the room , and more of those glowing globes hung from the ceiling . Sparhawk felt like a crude , barbaric intruder here . Cedon 's home reflected a gentle , saintly nature , and the big Pandion was acutely onscious of his chain-mail shirt and the heavy broadsword belted at is waist . He felt bulky and out of place , and his companions , wrapped n steel and leather and rough , grey cloth , seemed to loom around him like the crude monoliths of an ancient and primitive culture . A very old man entered from the far side of the room . He was ail and bent , and his shuffling steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wispy and snowy white , in his case the mark of extreme age other than a racial characteristic . In addition to his unbleached wool vibe , he wore a kind of shawl about his thin shoulders . Xanetia went to him immediately , touching his wrinkled old face with a gentle hand . Her eyes were full of concern for him , but she did not speak . " Well met , Sir Knights , " the old man greeted them . He spoke in my slightly accented Elenic , and his voice sounded thin and rusty as he seldom had occasion to speak at all . " And welcome to thee as well , dear sister , " he added , speaking to Sephrenia in nearly flawless , though archaic , Styric . " I am not your sister , old man , " she said , her face cold . " We are all brothers and sisters , Sephrenia of Ylara , High Priestess tit Aphrael . Our kinship lies in our common humanity . " " That may have been true once , Delphae , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your accursed race are no longer human . " He sighed . " Perhaps not . It is hard to say precisely what we are ? r what we will become . Put aside thine enmity , Sephrenia of Ylara. hou wilt come to no harm in this place , and for once , our purposes merge into one . Thou wouldst set us apart from the rest of mankind , and that is now also our desire . May we not join our efforts to achieve this end ? " She turned her back on him . Itagne , ever the diplomat , stepped in to fill the awkward gap . " Cedon , I presume ? " he said urbanely . The old man nodded . " I find Delphaeus puzzling , revered one , I must confess it . We ' Tamuls know virtually nothing about your people , and yet the Delphae have been central to a grossly affected genre in our literature . I 've  | always felt that this so-called Delphaeic literature ' had been spun out of whole cloth by third-rate poets with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all manner of things I had believed to be literary conceits have more than a little basis in fact . " Itagne was smooth , there was no question about that . His assertion that he was even more clever than his brother , the foreign minister , was probably quite true . The Anari smiled faintly . " We did what we could , Itagne of Matherion . I will grant thee that the verse is execrable and the sentimentality appalling , but Xadane ' did serve the purpose for which it was created . It softened and turned aside certain of the antagonisms the Styrics had planted in your society . The Tamuls control the Atans , and we did not wish a confrontation with our towering neighbors . I cringe to confess it to thee , but I myself played no small part in the composition of Xadane . ' " Itagne blinked . " Cedon , are we talking abut the same poem ? The Xadane ' I studied as a schoolboy was written about seven hundred years ago . " Has it been so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my stay in fire-domed Matherion . The university was stimulating . " Itagne was too well-trained to show his astonishment . " Your features are Tamul , Cedon , but did n't your coloration seem . . . odd ? " " Ye Tamuls are far too civilized to make an issue of deformity . My racial characteristics were simply taken to mean that I was an albino . The condition is not unheard of . I had a colleague  --  a Styric  --  who had a clubfoot . Rather surprisingly , we got on well together . I note from thy speech that contemporary Tamul hath changed from what it was when I was last among thy people . That would make it difficult for me to return to Matherion . Please accept my apologies for Xadane . ' It is truly abominable , but as I say , it served its purpose . " " I should have known , " Sephrenia cut in . " The whole body o Delphaeic literature was created with the sole purpose of fostering a climate of anti-Styric bigotry . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit which ye Styrics deceived the Tamuls ? " Cedon demanded . " Was the design not precisely the same ? Did ye not seek to instill the idea it the Tamul perception that the Delphae are subhuman ? " Sephrenia ignored the question . " Does your hatred of us run 54 deep that you would contaminate the understanding of an entire race ? ' " And how deeply doth thy hatred run , Sephrenia of Ylara ? Ar .  | thou not even now attempting to poison the minds of these simple Elenes against us ? " The Anari sank into a cushioned chair , passing one weary hand across his face . " Our mutual hatreds have gone , methinks , too far to be healed . Better far that we live apart . And that doth bring us to the issue which hath brought us together . It is our wish to be apart from all others . " " Because you 're so much better than the rest of us ? " Sephrenia 's tone was thick with contempt . " Not better , Priestess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiority to thy race . " " If you two want to renew a few eons-old hatreds , I think the rest of us would prefer not to sit through it , " Vanion said coolly . " You both seem quite able to manage without our help . " " You do n't know what they 've done , Vanion , " Sephrenia said with a mute appeal in her eyes . " Frankly , dear , I 'm not really interested in what happened several thousand years ago . If you want to chew old soup , please do it on your own time . " Vanion looked at the ancient Delphae . " I believe you had some kind of an exchange in mind , Cedon . We 'd love to sit around and watch you and Sephrenia slice each other into thin strips , but we 're a little pressed for time . Affairs of state , you understand . " Even Sparhawk choked a bit on that . " Thou art very blunt , Lord Vanion , " Cedon said in a coldly reproving tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation made up of spiteful little insults bores me . If you and Sephrenia really want to fight , use axes . " Have you had many occasions to deal with Elenes , revered An-ari ? " Itagne asked in an unruffled manner . " Almost none . " " You might consider offering up a few prayers of thanksgiving tor that . The Elenes have this distressing tendency to get right to the point . It 's dreadfully uncivilized , of course , but it does save time . I believe you wanted to address your proposal to Anakha . That 's him right there . I should probably warn you that Lord Vanion is the absolute soul of finesse when compared to Sparhawk , but Sparhawk is Anakha , so sooner or later you 're going to have a deal with him . " " Since we 've all decided to be unpleasant this evening , I do n't think we 'll get very far , " Sparhawk said . " Why do n't you tell me what  | you want , Cedon , and what you 're prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , and then we can talk about it tomorrow , after we 've had time to get a firmer grip on our civility . " " A wise course , perhaps , Anakha , " the old man agreed . " There is turmoil afoot in Tamuli . " " Yes . We 've noticed that . " " The turmoil is not directed at the empire , Anakha , but at thee . Thou were lured here because thou hast the keys to Bhelliom . Thine enemies covet the jewel . " " We know that , too . I do n't really need a preamble , Cedon . What 's the point of this ? " " We will aid thee in thy struggle , and I do assure thee that without our aid , thou canst not prevail . " " You 'll have to convince me of that , but we can talk about it some other time . What do you want in return ? " " We would have thee take up Bhelliom and seal us in this valley . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put us beyond the reach of all others , and put all others beyond our reach . All will be served by this  --  Elene and Tamul , Styric and Delphae . Use the infinite power of Bhelliom to set us apart from the rest of mankind so that we may continue our journey undisturbed . " " Journey ? " " A figure of speech , Anakha . Our journey is measured in genera ? tions , not in leagues . " " An even exchange , then ? You 'll help us to deal with our enemies if I close off this valley so that no one can ever get in  --  or out ? " " An even exchange , Anakha . " " All right . I 'll think about it . " " She wo n't talk to me about it , Sparhawk , " Vanion sighed , " or abou anything else , for that matter . " The silvery-haired preceptor and hi friend were speaking privately in a small room just off the corridor that ; led to the cluster of tiny , cell-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just a bit blunt last night , " Sparhawk told him . " Irrational behavior irritates me . I wish Aphrael were here . She could straighten Sephrenia out in fairly short order . " Sparhawk slid lower in his chair . " I 'm not so sure , Vanion . I do n't know if I 'm supposed to tell you this , but I get the feeling that Aphrael  | would n't interfere . Before she left , she told me that Sephrenia has to work this out for herself . " " Could Itagne shed any light on this antagonism between the Styrics and the Delphae ? " Sparhawk shook his head . " No more than he 's already told us . The whole business seems to date back to the time of the war with he Cyrgai . That was about ten thousand years ago , so history 's a little ague about what really happened . Evidently the Styrics and the Delle were allies , and there seems to have been a betrayal of some rt . " I gathered as much . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . The Styrics have made themselves useful to the Tamuls ver the centuries  --  as they made themselves useful to the Church in ) sia . They 've been busy insinuating their version of what happened to the Tamul perception of history . From what Cedon told us last ight , I 'd say that the Delphae have infiltrated the University of atherion and inserted Delphaeic literature into the Tamul culture ith precisely the same idea . The events of ten thousand years ago re going to be buried under a thick layer of myth and legend anyway , nd with both the Styrics and the Delphae busily muddying up the aters , the real truth probably wo n't ever come out into the open . " e smiled faintly . " I 'm not sure how significant it is , but the Styrics led to contaminate the historians , while the Delphae spent their time trying to contaminate the poets . Interesting contrast , would n't you say ? " " Aphrael would know the truth . " " Probably , but she 's not talking . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberate . I do n't think she really wants us to ow who was originally at fault . She does n't seem to want us to take Ides , for some reason , and that puts us in a very difficult position . I wonder if we 'll ever find out the truth behind this racial antagonism ? not that it really matters . I doubt if Sephrenia or the Anari themselves Even know . They 've both had about four hundred generations of hysterical propaganda to set their prejudices in stone . Our problem is that he Delphae can probably hold us here indefinitely . If we try to ride way , they 'll just turn us around and lead us right back , so eventually we 're going to have to negotiate with them . We all love Sephrenia , though , so if we do negotiate with the Delphae , she 'll take fire spon-taneously. "  | " Yes , I noticed that . What am I going to do , Sparhawk ? I bleed when she so much as pricks her finger . " " Lie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't have to be too obvious about it , but lean your neutrality slightly in her direction . I 'm the one in charge of Bhelliom , so Cedon 's going to have to deal with me . Technically , you 're secondary here  --  sorry , Vanion , but it 's true . Cedon 's going to be negotiating with me , not you . Glare at me now and then and raise objections . Sephrenia 's behaving irrationally , so the others , like good , logical Elenes , are going to oppose her . Let 's not isolate her entirely . You 're the most important person in her life , and if you seem to be turning against her as well , you 'll break her heart . " He smiled a bit wryly . " I 'd take it as a personal favor , though , if you did n't let her turn me into a toad about midway through the negotiations . " " Let 's go back a step or two , revered Anari , " Sparhawk suggested when they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to know what I 'm getting involved in here . I 'm not going to do anything to injure the Styrics . They 're sometimes a prickly and difficult people , but we 've grown fond of them for some reason . " He smiled at Sephrenia , hoping to soften her displeasure . " You mentioned a journey of some sort . Where are you going ? " " We are changing , Anakha . When the world turned against us , we appealed to Edaemus to protect us . " " Your God ? " The Anari nodded . " We were a childlike , unsophisticated people before the war with the Cyrgai , and Edaemus lived among us , sharing our simple joys and transient sorrows . Of all the people of this world , we were the least suited for war . " The old man looked at Sephrenia . " I will not offend thy teacher by speaking the truth about what led to our being made outcast . " " The truth is well known , " Sephrenia said stiffly . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ours . You believe that one thing happened , and we believe that something else took place . But that , Sephrenia of Ylara , is between us , and it doth not concern these Ernes . In truth , Lady , neither Styric nor Delphae were very admirable i that unfortunate affair . For whatever cause , Anakha , the Delphae were cast out , and the hands of all men were turned  | against us . We appealed , as I said , to Edaemus , and he responded by laying a curse on us . " " This Edaemus of yours has a peculiar way of showing his affec-t ion , " Ulath noted . " It was the only way to protect us , Sir Knight . We are not warlike lid have no skill with the weapons with which other men kill each ether , and so Edaemus cursed us to make our merest touch a weapon . ) ther men soon found that the touch of our hands meant death . " " Then why am I still here , Cedon ? " Kalten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off her horse for several days now , and her t o Hach has n't killed me . " " We have learned to control the curse , Sir Kalten . That was a part of the plan of Edaemus when he raised his hand against our lake . " " The lake ? " The Anari nodded . " Edaemus could not bear the thought of laying his curse upon us directly , and so he cursed the waters of the lake instead . The lake is our only source of water , and we therefore must drink of it . When first we came to this valley , the mind of Edaemus was as childlike as ours . In the spirit of play gave he the waters of the like that peculiar essence which doth illuminate us . We drink of the Like , and its waters infuse our bodies . Out of love did Edaemus make its appear like Gods . It was a harmless entertainment , and we soon forgave him for so altering us . When the world turned against us , however , did Edaemus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ley that curse , changed us as well . The touch of death which doth hold , our enemies at bay is but a small part of the design of our God , however . Circumstance hath set us apart from this world , and it is the , tent of Edaemus to set us yet further apart . We are changing , my t , lends . Our bodies are different , and our minds and spirits as well . We no longer as ye  --  nor as once we were . With each generation this nexorable change progresses . Xanetia , dear , gentle Xanetia , so far sur-t passeth me that I can not even begin to comprehend the extent of her bought . In time , methinks , she will equal  --  or even surpass  --  the very Gods themselves . " " And then you will supplant us , " Sephrenia accused . " Even as ? lie Trolls supplanted the Dawn-men and as we are supplanting the I rolls , so will you despised Delphae become our masters , putting aside tilt Gods and kenneling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fruits of the earth . We Styrics have endured such treat-  | ment at the hands of the Elenes for eons and we have learned much . You will not so easily subdue us , Cedon , and we will not worship you nor fawn at your feet like whipped dogs . " " How may we supplant thee and seize thy lands , Sephrenia of Ylara ? We are bound to our lake and may not long be away from its waters . Thy submission , moreover , would have no meaning for us , for we will not be here . We journey toward the light , and we will become light . My Xanetia , who will be Anarae , could join with the light eve now , but those of us who have not yet reached her perfection hol her back . When we are dead , there will no longer be any reason fo her to remain , and she will lead the Delphae out to dwell among th stars with Edaemus , who hath gone before us to prepare our home . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spiteful sneer " That is a word without meaning , Sephrenia of Ylara , " Xaneti said quietly . " All of us , Gods and men , move toward the same goal Edaemus hath gone before us , and we will go before thee . We it await thy coming with love , and we will even forgive thee for th wrong that thou hast done us . " " Forgive me ? " Sephrenia exploded . " I spurn thy condescendin forgiveness ! " She had lapsed , probably without realizing it , into ar chaic Styric . " I will never forgive thee nor accept any of thy forgive , ness . " But thou wilt , Sephrenia , " the glowing woman disagreed . " Eve now is thine heart doubtful within thy breast . Thou art of two minds gentle Sephrenia . I know thee well , and I know that this hatred o thine , like winter frost , doth lurk in the dark , shaded places of th soul . I do assure thee that it will melt in the warm sun of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even now begin its painfu thaw . But make no mistake , Sephrenia of Ylara , I do hate Styrics eve as thou hatest the Delphae . An hundred centuries of enmity is not lightly cast aside . I do hate the perfidious Styrics , but I do not hate thee . I know thine heart , dear sister , for it is even as mine own . In time will we both put aside this childish hatred and live together in peace . " Never ! " " Never , dear sister , is a long , long time . " " I think we 're getting a little far afield here , " Sparhawk cut in , " This sealing up of the valley is n't intended to be eternal , I gather ? " " There would be no need of that , Anakha , " the Anari replied .  | " Once we are gone , Edaemus will lift his curse from the lake , its waters will return to normal , and other men may freely come to this valley ithout fear . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Bhelliom , will seal it . I can guarantee you that no Delphae will ever leave . If we 're going to turn into moonbeams or sunlight , that wo n't inconcnience you , but if you 've got some other notion hidden away , you ight as well forget it . And if this Edaemus of yours has a secret agenda volving some sort of retaliation against the Styrics , you 'd better tell him to drop it . Bhelliom eats Gods for breakfast  --  as Azash found out . you still want me to seal your valley ? " " Yes , " Cedon replied without hesitation . " How about you , Sephrenia ? " Sparhawk asked . " Would that kind guarantee satisfy you ? " " They 'll try trickery , Sparhawk . They 're a deceitful race . " " You know the Bhelliom , Sephrenia  --  probably even better than I ) . Do you really think anybody  --  man or God  --  could trick it ? If I tell to keep the Delphae in and everybody else out , nobody 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not Aphrael , not Edaemus  --  not en the God of the Elenes . Even if all the Gods of this world and of II other worlds combined , Bhelliom would still keep them out . If I seal is valley , it will stay sealed . Even the birds and angleworms wo n't able to leave . Will that satisfy you ? " She refused to look at him . " I need an answer , little mother , and I 'd rather not have to wait II year to get it . Will it satisfy you ? " " You 're hateful , Sparhawk ! " " I 've got a lot on my mind just now . Think it over and let me now what you decide . " He turned to face the Anari . " All right , now know what you want . The next question is what 's in it for me ? What I get out of this arrangement ? " " Our assistance in thy struggle with thine enemies , Anakha . " " That 's a little unspecific , Cedon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly do for me that I ca n't do for myself ? " " Thou must have the cooperation of the jewel , Anakha . Thou mist compel the stone , but it loves thee not , and it doth sometimes liberately misunderstand thee  --  as when it took thee and the Childgoddess to Demos when thou sought to go to Delo in Arjuna . " " How did you know about that ? " Sparhawk was startled .  | " Thy mind is open to me , Anakha , as are all minds . This is but one of the services we can offer thee . Would it not be to thine advantage to know what those about thee are thinking ? " " It would indeed , Cedon , but there are other ways to wrest the truth from men 's hearts . " " But men who have been put to the torture know that they have been tortured , and they know what they have revealed unto thee . Our way is more subtle . " " He 's got a point there , Sparhawk , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cedon ? " " Thou art troubled by the duty to slay Xanetia should our people play thee false , Sir Knight . Thy mind is gently inclined toward her . " " He 's right about that , " Kalten admitted to the others . " I think these people can hear what others are thinking . " " We have other capabilities as well , Sir Knights , " the Anari told them , " and we freely offer them to thee in exchange for what we ask . " He looked rather sadly at Sephrenia . " I fear that when I reveal the nature of these capabilities , it will cause thee pain and harden thine heart yet more toward us , dear sister . " " Will you stop calling me that ? My heart is already like granite toward you and your kind . " " That is not true , Sephrenia of Ylara , " Xanetia disagreed . " Thou art troubled forasmuch as thou hast found no wickedness in us in this , thy first meeting with our kind . Hard put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy sense of duty to thy kindred than from any personal rancor . I do freely confess mine own similarly troubled state . I am inclined to love thee , even as thou art so inclined toward me . " " Stop that ! " Sephrenia burst out . " Keep your unclean hands out of my thoughts . " Stubborn , is n't she ? " Ulath murmured . " It is the nature of the Younger Gods of Styricum to protect their children  --  even from their own folly , " the Anari noted . " Thus it is that the Styrics must appeal to their Gods with spells and prayers for aid when they would step beyond the powers of other men . Is it not so , Sephrenia of Ylara ? " She refused to answer him . " That 's the core of Styric magic , Cedon , " Vanion replied for her . She glared at him , and Sparhawk silently groaned . Why could n't Vanion keep his mouth shut ?  | The Anari nodded . " Edaemus hath , as I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is therefore no longer able to watch over us . Thus hath he granted certain of us the power to do what must be done without his guidance . " " Unrestrained magic ? " Sephrenia exclaimed . " You hold the power of the Gods in your own hands with no restraints ? " " Some few of us , yes . " " That 's monstrous ! The human mind is n't capable of understanding the nature of that kind of power . We ca n't grasp the consequences of unleashing it to satisfy our childish whims . " " Thy Goddess hath instructed thee well , Sephrenia of Ylara , " anetia noted . " This is what she wishes thee to believe . " " Thy Goddess would keep thee a child , dear sister , " the Anari id . " For so long as thou art a child , she is secure in thy love . I tell thee truly , however , Edaemus cloth love us even as thine Aphrael doth ( we thee . His love , however , doth compel us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we must accept the consequences of our crs when we bring it to bear . It is a different kind of love , but it is love nonetheless . Edaemus is no longer here to guide us , so we can do hatever our minds are able to conceive . " The Anari smiled gently . ' Forgive me , my friends , " he said to them , " but one as old as I hath bait one peculiar interest . " He held up one withered old hand and I ) oked at it rather sadly . " How soon are we altered by the passing of years , and how distressing is the alteration . " The change seemed gradual , but considering the staggering nature that change , what was happening before their eyes was nearly miculous . The withered hand grew more firm-fleshed ; the knobby joints oothed ; and the wrinkles faded . It was not only the hand , however . e tracery of wrinkles and lines on Cedon 's face seemed to slide ay . His hollow cheeks filled out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant . They stared at him as , with no apparent effort , he versed the erosion of years . He regressed to vigorous youth , his skin car and his hand and face firm and unmarked . Then , he began to diminish , his limbs shrinking inside his garments . The prickly stubble nished from his cheeks and chin , and , as he continued to regress , Is head seemed to grow larger in proportion to his shrinking body . That might be far enough , " he said in a piping , childish voice . He iled , a strangely ancient smile that looked very much out of place that little boy 's face . " A miscalculation here might reduce me to ) thing . In truth , I have considered that , but my tasks and responsi-  | bilities are not yet completed . Xanetia has her own tasks , and I would not yet burden her with mine as well . " Sparhawk swallowed hard . " I think you 've made your point , Ce-don , " he said in a strained voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things that we ca n't do . " He looked around at his friends . " I can already see arguments brewing , " he told them , deliberately avoiding Sephrenia 's eyes , " and no matter what we decide , we 'll probably all have serious doubts about it . " " We could pray , " Bevier suggested . " Or roll dice and let them decide , " Ulath added . " Not with your dice , we could n't , " Kalten objected . " We could even fall back on logic , " Vanion concluded , " bu Sparhawk 's right . No matter how we try to decide , we could probably sit here all winter and still not agree . " He also avoided Sephrenia ' eyes . " All right , then , " Sparhawk said , reaching inside his tunic , " since Aphrael 's not here to bully us into agreement , we 'll let Bhelliom de-cide . " He took out the golden box and set it on the table in front o ' him . " Sparhawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Xanetia also exclaimed . " Bhelliom does n't love any of us , " he said , " so we can sort of rel on its neutrality . We need guidance here , and neither Edaemus no Aphrael is around to provide it  --  besides which , I do n't know that I 'd trust either of them anyway , given the peculiar circumstances here . We want an uncontaminated opinion , so why do n't we just find out what Bhelliom thinks about the situation ? "  | B lue-Rose , " Sparhawk said in Trollish to the glowing jewel in his hands , " I am Anakha . Do you know me ? " Bhelliom 's glow pulsed slightly , and Sparhawk could sense the stone 's stiff reluctance to acknowledge his dominion . Then he thought of something . " You and I need to talk , " he said , speaking in Elenic this time , " and I do n't think Khwaj and the others need to be listening . Can you understand me when I speak in this fashion ? " There was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good . Is there some way you can talk to me ? There 's something you and I have to decide . This is too important for me to simply force you to do what I want , because I could be wrong . I know you 're none too fond of me  --  or of any creature on this particular world  --  but I think that we may have some common interest this time . " " Let me go . " The voice was a kind of lingering whisper , but it was familiar . Sparhawk whirled around to stare at Kalten . His boyhood friend 's face was wooden , uncomprehending , and the words came stiffly from his lips . " Why hast thou done this thing , Anakha ? Why hast thou enslaved me ? " The archaic Elenic could not have come from Kalten , but why had Bhelliom chosen this most unlikely mouth ? Sparhawk carefully readjusted his thoughts , casting them in the profoundly formal language with which the stone had addressed him , and in the instant of that changeover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lain dormant in his  | mind until unlocked by this peculiar key . Strangely , his understanding had been bound up in language , and once he made the conscious shift from contemporary Elenic with all its casual imprecision to more stately and concise cadences , that previously closed part of his mind opened . " It was not I who enslaved thee , Blue-Rose . It was thine own inattention that brought thee into such perilous proximity to the red of iron , which congealed thee into thy present state , and it was Ghwerig who lifted thee from the earth and contorted thee into this similitude of a flower with his cruel diamond implements . " A stifled groan came from Kalten 's lips , a groan of pain endured and pain remembered . " I am Anakha , Blue-Rose , " Sparhawk continued . " I am thy creature . It is thou who hast caused me to be , that I might be the instrument of thy liberation , and I will not betray thy trust in me . I am in some part made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is thou who hast enslaved me . Didst thou not set my destiny apart , making me a stranger to the Gods of this world and to all other men ? But , though I am thine enslaved servant , I am , nonetheless , still of this world , and I will not have it destroyed nor its people crushed by the vile oppression of mine enemies . I did free thee from the enslavement of Ghwerig , did I not ? Is this not in some small measure proof of my fidelity to the task which thou hast lain upon me ? And , bound together in common purpose , did we not destroy Azash , who would have chained us both in a slavery harsher than that which now chains us together ? For mistake me not , Blue-Rose , even as thou art my slave , so am I thine , and once again the chain which binds us together is common purpose , and neither shall be free until that purpose be accomplished . Then shalt thou , and then shall I , be free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thou to go , an it please thee , to continue thine interrupted and endless journey to the farthest star . " " Thou hast learned well , Anakha , " Bhelliom said grudgingly , " but thine understanding of thy situation did never obtrude itself upon thy conscious thought where I could perceive it . I had despaired , thinking that I had wrought amiss . " Sephrenia was staring at them , first at Sparhawk and then at the seemingly comatose Kalten , and her pale , flawless face was filled with something very like chagrin . Xanetia stared , also , and her expression was no less chagrined . Sparhawk took a fleeting satisfaction in that . The two were very much alike in their perhaps-unconscious assumption of condescending superiority . Sparhawk 's sudden , unexpected  | awareness of things long concealed in his understanding had shaken that irritating smugness of theirs . For the first time in his life he con-s iously knew that he was Anakha , and more importantly , he knew the meaning of Anakha in ways neither Sephrenia nor Xanetia could ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach Bhelliom , and in joining his thought with Bhelliom 's , he had to some degree shared Bhelliom 's awareness , and that was something neither o t them could ever do . " Thou hast not wrought amiss , Blue-Rose , " he told the jewel . " Thine error lay in casting thy thought in this particular speech . Mine understanding was also cast so , and it did not reveal itself to me until I responded to thy words in kind . Now , let us to work withal . Mine enemies are also thine , forasmuch as they would bind thee even as they would bind me . Neither of us shall be secure in our freedom until they are no more . Are we agreed upon that ? " " Thy reasoning is sound , Anakha . " " Our purpose then is the same ? " " So it would seem . " " We 're making some headway here , " Sparhawk murmured . Kalten 's expression became coldly disapproving . " Sorry , " Sparhawk apologized , " force of habit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies and our purpose are common , and our thoughts are linked by this chain of thy forging , we must join our efforts in this cause . In victory shall we be freed . Our enemies and our Common purpose shall be no more , and the chain which links us will tall away . I do pledge it to thee that upon the completion of this task will I free thee to continue thy work . My life is surely within thy fist , and thou mayest destroy me if I play thee false . " " I find no falsity in thy thought , Anakha , and I will strengthen thine arm and harden thine heart , lest others , beloved by thee , seek to turn thee aside from thy design and thy pledge . We are agreed . " " Done , then ! " Sparhawk exclaimed . " And done ! " Bhelliom 's speech , emerging from Kalten 's lips , had ! wen dry and unemotional , but this time the voice was exultant . " And now to this decision which thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sephrenia 's tone was uncertain . " I 'm sorry , little mother , " he said , " I 'm not talking with you at the moment . Please do n't interrupt . " Sparhawk was not entirely sure 1 whether he should address his question to the sapphire rose or to Kaiten , who seemed to have been completely taken over by the spirit  | within the jewel . He settled for directing his question somewhere between them . " The Delphae have offered their assistance in exchange for a certain service , " he said . " They would have us seal their valley that none may enter and none may leave , and in recompense for that small favor they promise to aid us . Is their offer made in good faith ? " Sparhawk heard Xanetia 's sharp intake of breath . " It is , " Bhelliom replied . " There is no falsity in their offer . " " I did n't think so myself , but I wanted to be sure . " " Anakha . " The voice was firm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me . Our alliance is new and unfamiliar . It is not wise of thee to raise doubts in me by compressing thy words together so . Sparhawk suddenly laughed . " Forgive my lapse , Blue-Rose , " said . " We can trust the Delphae , then ? " " For the moment , yes . Their intent is presently without guile . It is uncertain what it will be tomorrow . Thy kind is inconstant , An-akha . " Kalten 's voice hesitated briefly . " I say that not as criticism , merely as observation . For the nonce mayest thou put thy trust in their sincerity  --  and they in thine . What may come subsequently lieth in the hands of chance . " " Then there is such a thing as chance ? " Sparhawk was a bit surprised at that . " We are told that all things are predetermined by the Gods . " " Whosoever told thee so was in error . " Bevier gasped . " My journey and my task were interrupted by chance , " Bhelliom continued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thine as well ? Truly I tell thee , Anakha , we must join with the Delphae in this enterprise , for if we do not , we shall surely fail . Whether one or both play the other false will depend on circumstance . At this time , the hearts of the Delphae are pure ; that may change . At this time , thine heart is also pure ; that may also change . But will we , nil we , we must join with them , lest we fail and languish forever in vilest bondage . " " You heard him , Bevier , " Sephrenia was saying to the olive-skinned Arcian later when Sparhawk quietly entered the room where the two were deep in conversation , " they worship the lake  --  the source of the contamination that makes them outcast . " " He did mention a God , Lady Sephrenia , " Bevier protested mildly . " I think he called their God Edaemus  --  or something like that . "  | " But Edaemus has abandoned them  --  cursed them and then turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edaemus had gone before them to prepare a place for them . " Bevier 's objection seemed even weaker . " He said that they were changing  --  turning into pure light . " " Lies , " she snapped . " The light that marks them is not the mark of a blessing , Bevier , it 's the mark of their curse . Cedon was cleverly trying to twist it around to make it seem that the Delphae are turning into something holy , when the reverse is actually true . " " They do perform magic , Sephrenia , and a kind of magic I 've never seen before . I would n't have believed that anyone could return to childhood if I had n't seen it with my own eyes . " " Exactly my point , Bevier . They 're using witchcraft , not magic . You 've never seen me imitate a God , have you ? " Sparhawk stepped unobserved back out into the hallway and went on down to the doorless cell Vanion occupied . " We 've got a prob-lem , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? " " Sephrenia 's trying to subvert Bevier . She 's trying to convince him that the Delphae practice witchcraft . You know Bevier . His eyes start to bulge out any time anyone so much as mentions the word . " " Why wo n't she just leave it alone ? " Vanion exclaimed , throwing his hands in the air . " Was n't Bhelliom 's word good enough for her ? " " She does n't want to believe , Vanion , " Sparhawk sighed . " We 've run into exactly the same thing when we 've tried to convince rural Elenes that Styrics are n't born with horns and tails . " " She of all people should be free of that sort of thing . " " I 'm afraid not , my friend . Styrics are good haters , I guess . How do we want to handle this ? " " I 'll confront her directly . " Sparhawk winced . " She 'll turn you into a frog if you do . " Vanion smiled briefly . " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do anything like that without the consent of his God , and Aphrael 's sort of fond of me  --  I hope . " " I 'll round up the others and get them out from underfoot so that you can speak with her privately . " " No , Sparhawk , it has to be done in front of them . She 's trying to slip around behind us to recruit converts . They 're all going to have to be made aware of the fact that she 's not to be trusted in this particular situation . "  | " Would n't it be a little better to talk with her privately at first ? before you humiliate her publicly ? " Vanion shook his head stubbornly . " We 've got to meet this head-on , " he declared . " You 'd better hope that Aphrael 's fond of you , " Sparhawk mur-mured . " They 've reverted to total paganism , " Sephrenia said stubbornly . " They might as well worship trees or oddly shaped rocks . They have no creed , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proves that . " They had gathered at Vanion 's summons in a large room at the end of the hall , and Sephrenia was urgently , even stridently , trying to make her case . " What 's the difference ? " Talen shrugged . " Magic , witchcraft , it 's all the same , is n't it ? " " Magic is of the Gods , Talen , " Bevier explained . " Our Holy Mother , in her wisdom , has chosen to allow the Church Knights to learn the secrets of Styricum that we might better serve her . There are restraints on us  --  certain areas we may not enter . Witchcraft is unrestrained because it is of the evil one . " " The Devil , you mean ? I 've never really believed in the Devil . There 's plenty of concentrated wickedness in people anyway , so we can probably get along fairly well without him . I 've known some very nasty people , Bevier . " " The existence of the Devil has been proved . " " Not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wandering a bit ? " Ulath suggested . " Does it really matter what the Delphae worship ? We 've allied ourselves with all sorts of people in the past in order to achieve this or that goal . Bhelliom says that we have to join forces with the Delphae , or we 're going to lose . I do n't like losing , so what 's the problem ? " " Bhelliom does n't know anything about this world , Ulath , " Sephrenia said . " So much the better . It comes at the problem with a clear and uncluttered understanding . If I need to jump behind a tree to keep from being swept away by an avalanche , I 'm not going to stop to question the tree about its beliefs first . " " Bhelliom will do or say anything in order to gain its freedom , " Sephrenia asserted . " That 's why I was so much against using it in the first place . "  | " We have to believe Bhelliom , Sephrenia , " Vanion told her , obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't make much sense for us to trust it with our very lives and then not believe what it tells us , does it ? It has done some very useful things for us in the past , you know . " " Only because it was compelled to , Vanion . Bhelliom submits because it 's forced to submit . I trust the Bhelliom even less than I trust the Delphae . It 's alien , totally alien , and we have no way of knowing what it will do . We 're safe only for as long as we keep it chained and force it to obey us . The minute we begin to listen to it , we 're in great danger . " " Is that how you feel about us , too , little mother ? " he asked her sadly . " We 're Elenes , and as a race we 've proved time and again that we 're not to be trusted . Do you want to chain us as well ? And force us to obey you ? " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Delphae are , though , are n't they ? " " No ! " " You 're being illogical , Sephrenia . The Delphae are human . We do n't care for the Zemochs or the Rendors , but we 've never tried to pretend that they are n't human . There are a lot of Elenes who do n't like you Styrics , but we 've never gone so far as to try to deny your humanity . " He paused , then drew in a deep breath . " I guess that 's what it comes down to , love . If you 're going to deny the humanity of the Delphae , how can I be positive that you do n't secretly feel the same way about me ? I 've lived in Sarsos , and many of the Styrics there wanted to treat me like some lower life-form . Did you agree with them ? Have I been some kind of pet , Sephrenia  --  a dog maybe ? Or a tame ape that you kept around for your private amusements ? Hang it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we deny anyone 's humanity , we open the door to unimaginable horror . Ca n't you see that ? " " The Delphae are different . " " Nobody 's different ! We have to believe that , because if we do n't , we deny our own humanity as well . Why wo n't you understand ? " Her face was very , very pale . " This is all very high-sounding and noble , Vanion , but it has nothing whatsoever to do with the Delphae . You do n't know anything about what they are or who they are , so you do n't really know what you 're talking about . You 've always come to me for guidance in the past when your ignorance was putting you in  | danger . Am I correct in assuming that we 're not going to do that any more ? " " Do n't be silly . " " I 'm not . I 'm being very serious . Are you going to ignore me o this issue ? Are you going to take up with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We do n't have any choice in the matter , ca n't you see that Bhelliom tells us that we 're going to fail if we do n't  --  and we ca n't fall I think the whole world 's going to depend on our not failing . " " You seem to have outgrown your need for me , then . It would have been polite of you to have told me that before you brought i to this accursed valley , but I suppose I was silly to expect politeness from an Elene in the first place . As soon as we get back to Matherion I 'll make arrangements to return to Sarsos , where I belong . " " Sephrenia ? " " No . This concludes it . I 've served the Pandion Order well an faithfully for three hundred years , and I thank you for your generous payment for my years of toil . We 're through , Vanion . This ends it . hope the rest of your life will be happy , but happy or sad , you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swept from the room . " It will be very dangerous , Anari , " Itagne warned , " and Xanetia the most important of all your people . Is it prudent to risk her life ? " " Truly , Itagne of Matherion , " the old man replied , " Xanetia precious to us , for she will be Anarae . She is , however , the most gift of us , and it may well be that her gifts will weight the scale in our fin confrontation with our common enemy . " Sparhawk , Vanion , and I agne had been summoned to meet with Cedon prior to their departure from the valley of Delphaeus . It was a fine autumn morning . A hi of frost , fast melting in the newly risen sun , steamed on the meadow and the shade under the boughs of the evergreens beyond that meadow was a deep , deep blue . " I merely wished to point it out , Anari , " Itagne said . " For all its splendor , Matherion is a city filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very strongly to the appearance of one of the Delphae in their midst . Your gentle Xanetia is an ethereal unworldly sort of person , hardly more than a girl . The fact that she ' a Shining One will protect her to some degree against overt physics attack , but are you really willing to expose her to the curses , the vi  | peration , and all the other kinds of abuse she 's sure to encounter ere at the center of the world ? " The Anari smiled . " Thou hast misperceived Xanetia , Itagne of ntherion . Doth she truly seem so much a child to thee ? Would thy Ind be more easy if thou wert aware that she is well past her first century of life ? " ltagne stared at him and then at Xanetia , who sat quietly near the Indow . " You are a strange people , Anari , " he said . " I 'd have guessed r age at no more than sixteen years . " " It is impolite to speculate about a lady 's age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Forgive me , Anarae , " Itagne replied with a courtly bow . " His Excellency here has raised a fairly important point , Anari , " nion said . The preceptor 's face was still marked by the pain of the previous day 's conversation with Sephrenia . " The lady 's appearance n't go unnoticed  --  not only in Matherion itself , but along the roads It ' II have to follow as we ride east as well . Is there some way we could guise her enough so that whole villages wo n't go into absolute panic moment she rides by ? " He looked apologetically at the Delphaeic man . " I would n't offend you for the world , Anarae , but you are very king . " " I thank thee for the compliment , gentle sir . " " Do you want to take over , Sparhawk ? " Vanion said . " I just seem be digging myself in deeper . " " We 're soldiers , Xanetia , " Sparhawk said bluntly , " and our an-r to hostility is fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial palace in Matherion if we have to , but I get the feeling t you might find that distressing . Would a disguise of some kind end you ? " Then a thought came to him . " Can we disguise you ? I ' t know if you 've noticed , but you glow . Some of your people have ie fairly close to us before the light started to show . Can your eternal fire be dampened ? " " We can control the light , Anakha , " Cedon assured him , " and Xanetia , the most gifted of us all , can control it even better than must  --  though it doth cause her pain to do so . For us , it is an unnatural doing . " " We 'll have to work on that , then . " " The pain is of no moment , Anakha , " Xanetia assured him . " Not to you , perhaps , but it is to me . Let 's start with your color-  | ation , though . Your features are Tamul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think , Itagne ? Could she pass for Tamul if we dyed her skin and hair ? " " That is not needful , Anakha , " Xanetia told him . Her brow fur ? rowed briefly in concentration , and gradually , almost like a slow blush , a faint golden tint began to mount in her cheeks , and her hair slipped from its colorless white into pale blonde . " Color is a quality of light , ' she explained quite calmly even as the embronzing of her skin and th darkening of her hair continued , " and since I can control the ligh from within me , so can I also control my color  --  indeed , by thus alter ing the light rather than suppressing it entirely , I can lessen the pain . A most happy solution for me  --  and for thee as well , I wot , since tho seemest sensitive to the pain of others . This is a simple matter . " H skin by now was almost the same pale gold as Itagne 's , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The change of shape is far more difficult , ' she conceded , " and the change of gender more difficult still . " " The what ? " Itagne choked . " I do not do that often  --  nor willingly , " she replied . " Edaemus di not intend for me to be a man , and I find it most uncomfortable . man 's body is so cluttered and untidy . " She held out her arm an examined it closely . " The color seemeth to me correct , " she observe Then she took a lock of her now-black hair and looked at it . " An this as well , " she added . " What thinkest thou , Itagne ? Would I pa unnoticed in Matherion now ? " " Hardly , divine Xanetia . " He smiled . " Thy passage through t streets of fire-domed Matherion would stop the hearts of all who behe thee , for thou art fair , and thy beauty doth bedazzle mine eye beyond all measure . " " Well said , " Sparhawk murmured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Itagne , " Xan tia smiled . " Thou art , I do believe , a master of flattery . " " You should probably know that Itagne is a diplomat , Anarae , Vanion advised her , " and his words are n't always to be trusted . Th time he 's telling you the truth , though . You 're an extraordinarily bea tiful woman . " She looked at him gravely . " Thine heart is sore within thee , is not , Lord Vanion ? " she observed . He sighed . " It 's my personal problem , Anarae , " he replied . " Not entirely so , my Lord . Now are we all of the same fellowshi and the troubles of one are the troubles of all . But that which troublet  | thee is of far greater note and causeth us all much greater concern than that which might grow from our comradely feelings for thee . This breach between thy beloved and thee doth endanger our cause , and until it be healed , our common purpose doth stand in peril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track that seemed more like a game trail than a route normally followed by humans . Sephrenia , accompanied by Bevier and young Berit , rode some distance to the rear , her face set and her eyes as hard as flint . Sparhawk and Vanion rode in the lead , following occasional directions from Xanetia , who rode directly behind them under Kalten 's watchful eye . " Just give her some time , Vanion , " Sparhawk was saying . " Women deliver ultimatums and declarations of war fairly often . Things like that are usually intended to get our attention . Any time I start neglecting Ehlana , she says something she does n't really mean to bring me up short . " " I 'm afraid this goes a little further than that , Sparhawk , " Vanion replied . " Sephrenia 's a Styric , but she 's never been so totally irrational before . If we could find out what 's behind this insane hatred of hers , we might be able to do something about it , but we 've never been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hates the Delphae simply because she hates the Delphae . " " Aphrael will straighten it out , " Sparhawk said confidently . " As soon as we get back to Matherion , I 'll have a talk with Danae , and ? " Sparhawk broke off as a sudden thought chilled his blood . " I have to talk with Xanetia , " he said , abruptly wheeling Faran around . " Trouble ? " Kalten asked as Sparhawk joined them . " Nothing immediate , " Sparhawk replied . " Why do n't you go on ahead and ride with Vanion for a while . I need to talk with Xanetia . " Kalten gave him a questioning look but rode on forward without any further questions . " Thou art troubled , Anakha , " Xanetia observed . " A little , yes . You know what I 'm thinking , do n't you ? " She nodded . " Then you know who my daughter is ? " " Yes . " " It 's a sort of secret , Anarae . Aphrael did n't consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's very important that Ehlana does n't find out . I think her sanity depends on it . "  | " Thy secret is safe , Anakha , I do pledge thee my silence on this issue . " What really happened , Xanetia ? Between the Styrics and the Delphae , I mean . I do n't want your version or Sephrenia 's . I want the truth . " " Thou art not meant to know the truth , Anakha . A part of thy task is to resolve this issue without recourse to the truth . " " I 'm an Elene , Xanetia , " he said in a pained voice . " I have to have facts in order to make decisions . " " Then it is thine intent to judge ? To decide if the guilt doth condemn the Styrics or the Delphae ? " " No . My intent is to get to the bottom of Sephrenia 's behavior so that I can change her mind . " " Is she so important to thee ? " " Why do you ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My questions are intended to help thee formulate thy thought , Anakha . " " I 'm a Pandion Knight , Xanetia . Sephrenia 's been the mother of our order for three centuries . Any one of us would give up his life for her without any hesitation at all . We love her , but we do n't share all of her prejudices . " He leaned back in his saddle . " I 'll only wait for so long , Xanetia . If I do n't get the real truth out of you  --  or out of Se-phrenia  --  I 'll just ask Bhelliom . " " Thou wouldst not ! " Her now-dark eyes were filled with a sudden chagrin . " I 'm a soldier , Xanetia , so I do n't have the patience for subtlety . You 'll excuse me ? I have to go talk with Sephrenia for a moment . " " Dirgis , " Xanetia told them as they crested a hill and saw a typical Atan town lying in the valley below . " Well , finally , " Vanion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where we are . " He looked over his map for a moment and then squinted up at the evening sky . " Is it too late in the day for us to take one of those long steps , Sparhawk ? " " No , my Lord , " Sparhawk replied . " There 's plenty of light . " " Are we still concerned about that ? " Ulath asked . " Have n't you and Bhelliom hammered that out yet ? " " We have n't been having any private chats , " Sparhawk replied . " There are still people out there who can locate Bhelliom when it 's  | out in the open , so I 've been keeping it inside its little house  --  just to be on the safe side . " " It 's well over three hundred leagues , Sparhawk , " Vanion pointed out . " It 's going to be later there . " " I 'm never going to get used to that , " Kalten said sourly . " It 's really very simple , Kalten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun goes down in Matherion , it 's still ? " " Please , Ulath , " Kalten told him , " do n't try to explain it to me . It just makes things worse . When people start to explain it , I sometimes think I can actually feel the world moving under me . I do n't like that very much . Just tell me that it 's later there , and let it go at that . I do n't really need to know why it 's later . " " He 's a perfect knight , " Khalad told his brother . " He does n't even want explanations . " " Look on the bright side of it , Khalad , " Talen replied . " After we 've gone through the wonderful training they 've got planned for us , we 'll be exactly like Kalten . Think how much easier life 's going to be for us when we do n't have to understand anything at all . " " I 'd guess that it 's very close to being fully dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe we 'd better wait until morning . " " I 'm not so sure , " Sparhawk disagreed . " The time 's going to come sooner or later when we 're going to have to make one of these jumps after the sun goes down . There 's nothing urgent in the wind right now , so it 's a good time for us to answer this question once and for all . " " Ah  --  Sparhawk ? " Khalad said . " Yes ? " " If you 've got a question , why not ask ? Now that you and Bhelhorn are on speaking terms , would n't it be simpler  --  and safer  --  to just ask it first ? Before you start experimenting ? Matherion 's on the coast , as I recall , and I 'd rather not come down about a hundred leagues out to sea . " Sparhawk felt just a little foolish . He took out the small golden box and opened the lid . He paused momentarily , casting his question in antique Elenic . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue-Rose , " he said . " Say thy question , Anakha . " This time the voice came from Khal-ad 's lips .  | " That 's a relief , " Kalten said to Ulath . " I almost chewed up my tongue with all the thee 's and thou 's last time . " " Can we safely go from one place to another when the pall of darkness hath covered the earth ? " Sparhawk asked . " There is no darkness for me , Anakha . " " I did not know that . " " Thou hadst but to ask . " " Yes . I do perceive that now . Mine understanding doth grow with each passing hour . On the eastern coast of far-flung Tamuli there doth lie a road which doth proceed southward to fire-domed Matherion . " " Yes . " " When my companions and I first beheld Matherion , we came in : sight of it when we did crest a long hill . " " Yes . I share thy memory of the place . " " Couldst thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the earth ? " " Yes . " Sparhawk started to reach into the box for his wife 's ring . Then he stopped . " We share a common purpose and thus are comrades . It is not meet that I should compel thee and whip thee into compliance with the power of Ghwerig 's rings . Thus I do not command thee , but request instead . Wilt thou take us to this place we both know , out of comradeship and common purpose ? " " I will , Anakha . " The blur which surrounded them momentarily was that same featureless grey , no darker than it had been when Bhelliom had transported them in daylight . Night and day appeared to be irrelevant . Sparhawk dimly perceived that Bhelliom took them through some different place , a colorless emptiness that adjoined all other places  --  a kind of doorway to everywhere . " You were right , my Lord , " Kalten said to Vanion , looking up at the star-studded night sky . " It is later here , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her saddle . " Are you unwell , Lady ? " he asked her . " It is of no moment , Sir Knight . A slight giddiness , nothing more . " " You get used to it . The first few times , are a little unsettling , but that wears off . " Khalad held out the box , and Sparhawk put Bhelliom back inside . " I do not do this to imprison thee , " he told the jewel . " Our enemies can sense thy presence when thou art exposed , and this receptacle doth conceal thee from their search . " The Bhelliom pulsed slightly in acknowledgment . Sparhawk closed the cap over his ring , took the box from his squire , and closed it . Then he tucked it back into its usual place inside his tunic . Matherion , ruddy with torchlight , lay below , and the pale path of light from the newly risen moon stretched from the horizon across the waters of the Tamul Sea to her doorstep , yet another of the innumer-  | able roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . " Are you open to a suggestion , Sparhawk ? " Talen asked . " You sound just like Tynian . " " I know . I 'm sort of filling in for him while he 's away . We 've been out of Matherion for a while , so we do n't know what 's really been going on here . Suppose I slip into town and have a look  --  ask a few questions , find out what we 're riding into  --  the usual sort of thing . " Sparhawk nodded . " All right , " he said . " That 's all ? Just all right ' ? No protests ? No objections ? No hourlong lectures about being careful ? I 'm disappointed in you , Sparhawk . " " Would you listen to me if I objected or delivered a lecture ? " " No , not really . " " Why waste the time , then ? You know what you 're doing and how to do it . Just do n't take all night . " Talen swung down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a rough , patched smock and pulled it on over his other clothes . Then he bent , rubbed his hand in the dirt of the road , and artfully smudged his face . He stirred up his hair and sifted a handful of straw from the roadside onto it . " What do you think ? " he asked Sparhawk . " You 'll do . " Sparhawk shrugged . " Spoilsport , " Talen grumbled , climbing back on his horse . " Khalad , come along . You can watch my horse for me while I sniff around . " Khalad grunted , and the two rode on down the hill . " Is the child truly so gifted ? " Xanetia asked . " He 'd be offended if you called him a child , Lady , " Kalten replied , " and he can come closer to being invisible than anybody I know . " They drew back some distance from the road and waited . It was an hour later when Talen and his brother returned . " Things are still more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy reported . " No open fighting in the streets , you mean ? " Ulath laughed . " Not yet . Things are a little hectic at the palace , though . It 's got something to do with documents of some kind . The whole govern-ment 's in an uproar . None of the people I talked with knew all that much about it . The Church Knights and the Atans are still in control , though , so it 's safe to jump from here to the courtyard of Ehlana 's castle if we want . "  | Sparhawk shook his head . " Let 's ride in . I 'm sure there are still Tamuls inside the walls , and probably half of them are spies . Let 's not give away any secrets if we do n't have to . Is Sarabian still staying in the castle ? " Talen nodded . " Your wife 's probably been teaching him a few tricks ? ' roll over , ' play dead , ' sit up and beg ' ? that sort of thing . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met our queen yet , have you , your Excellency ? " Talen grinned . " I 'd say that you 're in for a whole new experience . " " It has to do with setting up the new filing system , my Lord , " the young Pandion at the drawbridge explained in reply to Vanion 's question . " We needed room to rearrange things , so we spread all the government files out on the lawn . " " What if it rains ? " " That would probably simplify the job a great deal , my Lord . " They dismounted in the courtyard and went up the broad stairs to the ornately carved main door , paused briefly to put on the cushioned shoes that protected the brittle floor-covering , and went inside . Queen Ehlana had been advised of their arrival and she was waiting for them at the door to the throne room . Sparhawk 's heart caught in his throat as he looked at his lovely young wife . " So nice of you to stop by , Sir Sparhawk , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . " Sorry we 're so late , dear , " he apologized after they had exchanged a brief , formal sort of kiss . " Our travel plans got a little skewed . " He was painfully conscious of the half-dozen or so Tamuls lingering nearby trying to look very hard as if they were n't listening . " Why do n't we go on upstairs , my Queen ? We 've got quite a bit to tell you , and I 'd like to get out of this mail shirt before it permanently embeds itself into my skin . " " You are not going to wear that stinking thing into my bedroom , Sparhawk . As I remember , the baths lie in that general direction . Why do n't you take your fragrant friends and go make use of them ? The ladies can come with me . I 'll round up the others , and we 'll all meet you in the royal quarters in about an hour . I 'm sure your explanation of your tardiness will be absolutely fascinating . " Sparhawk felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conventional doublet and hose . He and his friends trooped up the stairs that mounted into the central tower where the royal apartments were located . " You 're late , Sparhawk , " Mirtai said bluntly when they reached the top of the stairs . " Yes . My wife 's already pointed that out to me . Come inside . You 'll need to hear this , too . " Ehlana and the others who had remained behind were gathered in the large , blue-draped sitting room . Sephrenia and Danae were conspicuously absent , however . " Well , finally ! " Emperor Sarabian said as they entered . Sparhawk was startled by the change in the emperor 's appearance . His hair was ! - tied back from his face , he wore tight-fitting black hose and a fullsleeved linen shirt . He looked younger for some reason , and he was holding a rapier with the kind of familiarity that spoke of much practice . " Now we can get on with the business of overthrowing the gov-ernment . " " What have you been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarabian and I have been expanding our horizons . " She shrugged . " I knew I should n't have stayed away so long . " " I 'm glad you brought that up . That very same thought 's been on my mind for the longest time now . " " Why do n't you just save yourself some time and unpleasantness , Sparhawk ? " Kalten suggested . " Just show her why we had to take this little trip . " " Good idea . " Sparhawk reached inside his doublet and took out the unadorned gold box . " Things were beginning to get out of hand , Ehlana , so we decided to go fetch some reinforcements . " " I thought that 's what Tynian was doing . " " The situation called for something a little more significant than j the Church Knights . " Sparhawk touched the band of his ring to the lid of the box . " Open , " he said . He kept the lid partially closed to conceal the fact that his wife 's ring was also inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sparhawk ? " she asked him , looking at the cover concealing the stone . " I 'll explain in a bit . " He reached in and took out the Bhelliom . " This is why we had to leave , dear . " He held up the stone . She stared at it , the color draining from her face . " Sparhawk ! " she gasped .  | " What a magnificent jewel ! " Sarabian exclaimed , reaching his hand out toward the sapphire rose . " That might not be wise , your Majesty , " Itagne cautioned . " That 's the Bhelliom . It tolerates Sparhawk , but it might pose some dangers to anyone else . " " Bhelliom 's a fairy tale , Itagne . " " I 've been reassessing my position on various fairy tales lately , your Majesty . Sparhawk destroyed Azash with Bhelliom  --  just by touching it to him . I do n't advise putting your hands on it , my Emperor . You 've shown some promise in the past few months , and we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Itagne ! " Oscagne said sharply . " Mind your manners ! " " We 're here to advise the emperor , brother mine , not to coddle him . Oh , incidentally , Oscagne , when you sent me to Cynestra , you invested me with plenipotentiary powers , did n't you ? We can check over my commission , if you like , but I 'm fairly sure I had that kind of authority  --  I usually do . I hope you do n't mind , old boy , but I 've concluded a couple of alliances along the way . " He paused . " Well , " he amended , " Sparhawk did all the real work , but my commission put some slight stain of legality on the business . " " You ca n't do that without consulting Matherion first , Itagne ! " Oscagne 's face was turning purple . " Oh , be serious , Oscagne . All I did was seize some opportunities that presented themselves , and I was hardly in a position to tell Sparhawk what he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had things more or less under control in Cynestra when Sparhawk and his friends dropped by . We left Cynestra , and ? " " Details , Itagne . What did you do in Cynestra ? " Itagne sighed . " You can be so tedious at times , Oscagne . I found out that Ambassador Taubel was in bed with Kanzad , the Interior Ministry 's station chief . They had King Jaluah pretty much dancing to their tune . " Oscagne 's face went bleak . " Taubel 's defected to Interior ? " " I thought I just said that . You might want to run a quick evaluation of your other embassies , too . Interior Minister Kolata 's been very busy . Anyway , I threw Taubel and Kanzad  --  along with the entire police force and most of the embassy staff  --  into a dungeon , declared martial law , and put the Atan garrison in charge . " " You did what ? "  | " I 'll write you a report about it one of these days . You know me well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You exceeded your authority , Itagne . " " You did n't impose any limitations on me , old boy . That gave me carte blanche . All you said was to have a look around and to do what needed to be done , so I did . " " How did you persuade the Atans to go along with you without written authorization ? " Itagne shrugged . " The commander of the Atan garrison there is a fairly young woman  --  quite attractive , actually , in a muscular sort of way . I seduced her . She was an enthusiastic seducee . Believe me , Oscagne , she 'll do absolutely anything for me . " He paused . " You might want to make a note of that in my file  --  something about my willingness to make sacrifices for the empire and all that . I did n't give her total free rein , though . The dear child wanted to give me the heads of , Taubel and Kanzad as tokens of her affection , but I declined . My rooms at the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the space for stuffed trophies on the walls . I told her to lock them up instead and to keep a firm grip on King Jaluah until Taubel 's replacement arrived . You need n't hurry with that appointment , my brother . I have every confidence in her . " " You 've set back relations with Cynesga by twenty years , Itagne . " " What relations ? " Itagne snorted . " The Cynesgans respond only to naked force , so that 's what I used on them . " " You spoke of alliances , Itagne , " Sarabian said , flicking the tip of his rapier . " Just exactly to whom have you committed my undying trust and affection ? " " I was just coming to that , your Majesty . After we left Cynestra , we went on to Delphaeus . We spoke with their chieftain , the Anari-a very old man named Cedon  --  and he offered his assistance . Spar-hawk 's going to take care of our side of the bargain , so there 's no cost to the empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must come from our mother 's side of the family , your Majesty , " he apologized . " There was an uncle of hers that was always a little strange . " " What are you talking about , Oscagne ? " " My brother 's obvious insanity , your Majesty . I 'm told that things like that are hereditary . Fortunately , I favor our father 's side of the family . Tell me , Itagne , are you hearing voices , too ? Do you have visions of purple giraffes ? "  | " You can be so tiresome sometimes , Oscagne . " " Would you tell us what happened , Sparhawk ? " Sarabian asked . " Itagne covered it fairly well , your Majesty . I take it that you Famuls have some reservations about the Shining Ones ? " " No , " Oscagne said , " I would n't call them reservations , your Highness . How could we have any reservations about a people who do n't exist ? " " This argument could go on all night , " Kalten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked Xanetia , who sat quietly beside him with her head slightly bowed . " If you do n't show them who you are , they 'll wrangle for days . " " An it please thee , Sir Knight , " she replied . " So formal , my dear ? " Sarabian smiled . " Here in Matherion , we only use that mode of speech at weddings , funerals , coronations , and other mournful events . " " We have long been isolate , Emperor Sarabian , " she replied , " and unmoved by the winds of fashion and the inconstant tides of usage . I do assure thee that we find no inconvenience in what must seem to thee forced archaism , for it cometh to our lips unbidden and is our natural mode of speech  --  upon such rare occasions when speech among us is even needful . " The door at the far end of the room opened , and Princess I ) anae , dragging Rollo behind her , entered quietly with Alean close behind her . Xanetia 's eyes widened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep , " the little princess reported to her mother . " Is she all right ? " Ehlana asked . " Lady Sephrenia seemed very tired , your Majesty , " Alean responded . " She bathed and went directly to bed . I could n't even interest her in any supper . " " It 's probably best to just let her sleep , " Ehlana said . " I 'll look in on her later . " Emperor Sarabian had obviously taken advantage of the brief interruption to frame his thoughts in a somewhat studied archaism . " Verily , " he said to Xanetia , " thy mode of speech doth fall prettily upon mine ear , Lady . In truth , however , thou hast been unkind to . absent thyself from us , for thou art fair , and thine elegant mode of Address would have added luster to our court . Moreover , thine eyes . and thy gentle demeanor do shine forth from thee and would have provided instruction by ensample for they who are about me. "  | " Thy words are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclining her head , " and I do perceive that thou are a consummate flatterer . " " Say not so , " he protested . " I do assure thee that I speak truly from mine heart . " He was obviously enjoying himself . She sighed . " Thine opinion , I do fear me , will change whe thou dost behold me in my true state . I have altered mine appear ance as necessary subterfuge to avoid affrighting thy subjects . For though it doth cause me grave distress to confess it , should th people see me in mine accustomed state , they would flee , shrieking in terror . " " Canst thou truly inspire such fear , gentle maiden ? " He smile . " I can not give credence to thy words . In truth , methinks , should thou appear on the streets of fire-domed Matherion , my subjects would indeed run  --  but not away from thee . " " That thou must judge for thyself , Majesty . " " Ah  --  before we proceed , might I inquire as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Itagne asked prudently . " I 'm well , Itagne . " " No shortness of breath ? No heaviness or twinges in your Majes ty 's chest ? " " I said that I 'm healthy , Itagne , " Sarabian snapped . " I certainly hope so , your Majesty . May I be permitted to presen the Lady Xanetia , the Anarae of the Delphae ? " " I think your brother 's right , Itagne . I think you 've taken leave of  --  Good God ! " Sarabian was staring in open horror at Xanetia . Like the dye running out of a bolt of cheap cloth , the color was draining from her skin and hair , and the incandescent glow that had marke her before she had disguised it began to shine forth again . She rose to her feet , and Kalten stood up beside her . " Now is the stuff of thy nightmares made flesh , Sarabian of T. muli , " Xanetia said sadly . " This is who and what I am . Thy servan Itagne hath told thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would greet thee in manner suitable to thy station , bu like all the Delphae , I am outcast , and therefore not subject to thee I am here to perform those services which devolve upon my people by reason of our pact with Anakha , whom thou hast called Sparhawk of Elenia . Fear me not , Sarabian , for I am here to serve , not ti destroy . " Mirtai , her face deathly pale , had risen to her feet . Purposefully  | she stepped in front of her mistress and drew her sword . " Run , Eh-lana , " she said grimly . " I 'll hold her back . " " That is not needful , Mirtai of Atan , " Xanetia told her . " As I said , I mean no harm to any in this company . Sheathe thy sword . " " I will , accursed one  --  in your vile heart ! " Mirtai raised her sword . Then , as if struck by some great blow , she reeled back and fell to the floor , tumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing forward and clawing at their sword hilts . " I would not hurt them , Anakha , " Xanetia warned Sparhawk , " but I must protect myself that I may keep faith with the pact between thee and my people . " " Put up your swords ! " Vanion barked . " The lady is a friend ! " " But ? " Kring protested . " I said to put up your swords ! " Vanion 's roar was shattering , and Kring and Engessa stopped in their tracks . Sparhawk , however , saw another danger . Danae , her eyes bleak and her face set , was advancing on the Delphaeic woman . " Ah , there you are , Danae , " he said , moving rather more quickly than his casual tone might have suggested . He intercepted the vengeful little princess . " Are n't you going to give your poor old father a kiss ? " He swept her up into his arms and smothered her indignant outburst by mashing his lips to hers . " Put me down , Sparhawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not until you get a grip on your temper , " he muttered , his mouth still clamped to hers . " She hurt Mirtai ! " " No , she did n't . Mirtai knows how to fall without getting hurt . Do n't do anything foolish here . You knew this was going to happen . Everything 's under control , so do n't get excited  --  and do n't , for God 's sake , let your mother find out who you really are . " " It does n't really talk ! " Ehlana interrupted Sparhawk 's account of what had taken place in Delphaeus . " Not by itself , no , " Sparhawk replied . " It spoke through Kaltenwell , it did the first time , anyway . " " Kalten ? " " I have no idea why . Maybe it just seizes on whoever 's handy .  | The language it uses is archaic and formal  --  thee 's and thou 's and that sort of thing . Its speech is much like Xanetia 's , and it wants me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech is important . " He rubbed one hand across his freshly shaved cheek . " It 's very strange , but as soon as I began to speak  --  and think  --  in twelfth-century Elenic , something seemed to open in my mind . For the first time I knew that I was Anakha , and I knew that Bhelliom and I are linked together in some profoundly personal way . " He smiled wryly . " It seems that you 're married to two different people , love . I hope you 'll like Anakha . He seems a decent enough sort  --  once you get used to the way he talks . " " Perhaps I should just go mad , " she said . " That might be easier than trying to understand what 's going on . How many other strangers do you plan to bring to my bed tonight ! " Sparhawk looked at Vanion . " Should I tell them about Se-phrenia ? " " You might as well , " Vanion sighed . " They 'll find out about it soon enough anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked into her grey eyes . " You 're going to have to be a little careful when you talk with Sephrenia , dear , " he told her . " There 's an ancient enmity between the Delphae and the Styrics , and Sephrenia grows irrational whenever she 's around them . Xanetia has problems with the Styrics as well , but she manages to keep it under control better than Sephrenia does . " " Doth it seem so to thee , Anakha ? " Xanetia asked . She had resumed her disguise , more for the sake of the comfort of the others than out of any real need , Sparhawk guessed . Mirtai sat not far from her with watchful eyes and with her hand resting on her sword hilt . " I 'm not trying to be personally offensive , Anarae , " he apologized . " I 'm just trying to explain the situation so that they 'll understand when you and Sephrenia try to claw each other 's eyes out . DD " I 'm sure you 've noticed my husband 's blinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he absolutely overwhelms us with it . " Xanetia actually laughed , then looked at Itagne . " These Elenes are a complex people , are they not ? I do detect great agility of thought  | behind this bluff manner of theirs , and subtleties I would not have expected from a people who tailor steel into garments . " Sparhawk leaned back in his chair . " I have n't really covered everything that happened , but that 's enough to let you know in general what we encountered . We can fill in more detail tomorrow . What 's been going on here ? " " Politics , of course , " Ehlana shrugged . " Do n't you ever get tired of politics ? " " Do n't be silly , Sparhawk . Milord Stragen , why do n't you tell him ? It shocks him when I start going into all the sordid details . " Stragen was once again dressed in his favorite white satin doublet . The blond thief was sunk deep in a chair with his feet up on a table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements involved in this business than hobgoblins and resurrected antiq-uities , " he began . " We knew that Krager was involved  --  and Interior Minister Kolata  --  and that turned it into ordinary , garden-variety politics . We did n't know where Krager was , so we decided to find out just how deeply Interior was infected . Since all policemen everywhere are compulsive about paperwork , we were fairly sure that somewhere in that rabbit warren of a building was a set of files that would identify the people we wanted to talk with . The problem was that we could n't just walk into the ministry and demand to see their files without giving away the fact that we knew what they were up to , which in turn would have let them know that Kolata was our prisoner instead of a willing guest . Baroness Melidere came up with the idea of a new filing system , and that gave us access to all the files of all the ministries . " " It was dreadful . " Oscagne shuddered . " We had to disrupt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really only interested in the files at Interior . Milord Stragen and the baroness put their heads together and concocted a system . It 's totally irrational and wildly inconsistent , but for some reason it works amazingly well . I can lay my hands on any given piece of paper in less than an hour . " " Anyway , " Stragen continued , " we browsed through the files at Interior for a week or so , but the people over there kept slipping back into the building at night to move things around so that we 'd have to start all over again every morning . That 's when we decided to just move our operations out onto the lawns . We stripped all the  | paper out of all the buildings and spread it out on the grass . That inconvenienced the rest of the government enormously , but Interior was still holding out on us . They were still hiding the critical files . Caalador and I reverted to type and tried burglary  --  along with Mirtai . The queen sent her along to remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuables , I guess . It took a few nights , but we finally found the hidden room where the files we wanted were concealed . " " Did n't they miss them the next morning ? " Bevier asked him . " We did n't take them , Sir Knight , " Caalador told him . " The queen called in a young Pandion who used a Styric spell to bring the information back to the castle without physically removing the docu-ments . " He grinned . " We got us all that there real incriminatin ' stuff , an ' they do n't know we got it . We stole it , an ' they do n't even miss it . " " We 've got the name of every spy , every informer , every secret policeman , and every conspirator of whatever rank Interior has in all of Tamuli . " Sarabian smirked . " We 've been waiting for all of you to come home so that we can take steps . I 'm going to dissolve the Ministry of the Interior , round up all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been in close contact , and we 've laid our plans very carefully . As soon as I give the word , the Atans are going to take charge of the entire empire . Then I 'll really be the emperor instead of just a stuffed toy . " " You 've all been very busy , " Vanion observed . " It makes the time go faster , my Lord . " Caalador shrugged . " We went a little farther , though . Krager obviously knew that we were using the criminals of Matherion as spies , but we were n't sure if he knew about the hidden government . If he thinks our organization 's localized , that 's not much of a problem ; but if he knows that I can give the order here in Matherion , and somebody dies in Chyrellos , that 's a whole ' nother thang . " " I 've missed that dialect , " Talen said . He considered it . " Not really very much , though , " he added . " Critic , " Caalador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ? " Ulath asked him . Caalador spread one hand and rocked it back and forth dubiously . " It 's sorta hord t ' say , " he admitted . " They 's some places whur it iz ez them folks o ' oum kin move around free as frogs in a muddy pond .  | Other places , they ca n't . " He made a sour face . " It probably all boils down to natural talent . Some are gifted ; some are n't . We 've made a little headway in putting names to some of the rabid nationalists in various parts of Tamuli  --  at least we think it 's headway . If Krager really knows what we 're doing , he could be feeding us false information . We wanted to wait until you came back before we tested the information we 've got . " " How do you test something like that ? " Bevier asked . " We 'll send out the order to have somebody 's throat cut , then see if they try to protect him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or maybe one of those nationalist leaders  --  Elron , maybe . Is n't that astonishing , Sparhawk ? That 's one of the things we found out . It turns out that Elron is the mysterious Sabre . " " What an amazing thing , " Sparhawk replied with feigned aston-ishment . " Caalador wants to kill the man named Scarpa , " Stragen went on , " but I favor Elron  --  although my preference in the matter could be viewed as a form of literary criticism . Elron deserves killing more for his abominable verse than his political opinions . " " The world can stand a little more bad poetry , Stragen , " Caalador told his friend . " Scarpa 's the really dangerous one . I just wish we could put a name to Rebal , but so far he 's eluded us . " " His real name 's Amador , " Talen told him . " He 's a ribbon clerk in Jorsan on the west coast of Edom . " " How did you find that out ? " Caalador seemed astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We saw Rebal making a speech to some peasants out in the woods . Then , later on when we were in Jorsan , a gust of wind blew me into his shop . He is n't really very much to worry about . He 's a charlatan . He uses carnival tricks to make the peasants think that he 's raising the ghost of Incetes . Sephrenia seems to think that means that our enemies are spread thin . They do n't have enough real magicians to arrange all these visitations , so they have to resort to trickery . " " What were you doing in Edom , Sparhawk ? " Ehlana asked . " We went through there on our way to pick up Bhelliom . " " How did you get there and back so fast ? " " Aphrael helped us . She 's very helpful  --  most of the time . " Sparhawk avoided looking at his daughter . He rose to his feet . " We 're all , I little tired tonight , " he suggested , " and I rather expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take us quite a while . Why do n't we break off here and get some sleep ? Then we 'll be able to attack it again in the morning when we 're all fresh . " " Good idea , " Ehlana agreed , also rising . " Besides , I 've got this burning curiosity . " " Oh ? " " As long as I 'm going to be sleeping with him , I should probably get to know this Anakha fellow , would n't you say ? Sleeping with total strangers so tarnishes a girl 's reputation , you know . " " She 's still asleep , " Danae said , quietly closing the door to Sephrenia 's room . " Is she all right ? " Sparhawk asked . " Of course she is n't . What did you expect , Sparhawk ? Her heart 's broken . " " Come with me . We need to talk . " " I do n't think I want to talk with you right now , Father . I 'm just a little unhappy with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't be too sure . " " Come along . " He took her by the hand and led her up a long flight of stairs to the top of the tower and then out onto the parapet . He prudently closed the door and bolted it behind them . " You blundered , Aphrael , " he told her . She raised her chin and gave him a flat , icy stare . " Do n't get imperial with me , young lady . You made a mistake . You never should have let Sephrenia go to Delphaeus . " " She had to go . She has to go through this . " " She ca n't . It 's more than she can bear . " " She 's stronger than she looks . " " Do n't you have any heart at all ? Ca n't you see how much she 's suffering ? " " Of course I can , and it 's hurting me far more than it 's hurting you , Father . " " You 're killing Vanion , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looks . Why did all of you turn against Sephrenia at Delphaeus ? Two or three soft words from Xanetia was all it took to make you throw away three hundred years of love and devotion . Is that the way you Elenes customarily treat your friends ? " " She 's the one who forced the issue , Aphrael . She started deliv-  | ering ultimatums . I do n't think you realize how strongly she feels about the Delphae . She was totally irrational . What 's behind all of that ? " " That 's none of your business . " " I think it is . What really happened during the Cyrgai wars ? " " I wo n't tell you . " " Art thou afeared to speak of it , Goddess ? " Sparhawk spun around quickly , a startled oath coming to his lips . It was Xanetia . She stood all aglow , not far from where they were talking . " This does n't concern you , Xanetia , " Aphrael told her coldly . " I must needs know thine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no real moment . Thine , however , would be more troublesome . Art thou also unkindly disposed toward me ? " " Why do n't you leech my thoughts and find out for yourself ? " " Thou knowest that I can not , Aphrael . Thy mind is closed to me . " " I 'm so glad you noticed that . " " Behave yourself , " Sparhawk told his daughter , speaking very firmly . " Stay out of this , Sparhawk . " " No , Danae , I do n't think I will . Are you behind the way Sephrenia was behaving at Delphaeus ? " " Do n't be absurd . I sent her to Delphaeus to cure her of that nonsense . " Are you sure , Aphrael ? You 're not behaving very well at the moment yourself , you know . " " I do n't like Edaemus , and I do n't like his people . I 'm trying to cure Sephrenia out of love for her , not out of any affection for the Delphae . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this began , Goddess , " Xanetia pointed out . " That also was not out of any great affection for your race , Xanetia . My family was wrong , and I opposed them out of principle . You would n't understand that , though , would you ? It had to do with love , .1nd you Delphae have outgrown that , have n't you ? " " How little thou knowest us , Goddess , " Xanetia said sadly . " As long as we 're all speaking so frankly , I 've noticed a certain bias against Styrics in some of your remarks , Anarae , " Sparhawk said pointedly . " I have reasons , Anakha  --  many reasons . "  | " I 'm sure you have , and I 'm sure Sephrenia has reasons , too . But whether we like each other or not is really beside the point . I am going to straighten this all out . I 've got work to do , and I ca n't do it in the middle of a catfight . I will make peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bhelliom to do it . " " Sparhawk ! " Danae 's face was shocked . " Nobody wants to tell me what really happened during the Cyrgai wars , and maybe that 's just as well . I was curious at first , but not any longer . What it boils down to , ladies , is that I do n't care what happened . The way you 've all been behaving sort of says that nobody 's hands were really clean . I want this spiteful wrangling to stop . You 're all behaving like children , and it 's beginning to make me tired . "  | There were dark circles under Sephrenia 's eyes the next morning , and the light had gone out of her face . Her white Styric robe was partially covered by a sleeveless overmantle of deepest black . Sparhawk had never seen her wear that kind of garment before , and her choice ? of both the garment and the color  --  seemed ominous . She joined them at the breakfast table reluctantly , and only at Ehlana 's express command . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her injury drawn about her like a defensive wall . She would not look at Vanion and refused breakfast despite Alean 's urgings . Vanion appeared no less injured . His face was drawn and pale , quite nearly as pale as it had been when he had been carrying the burden of the swords , and his eyes were filled with pain . Breakfast under those circumstances was strained , and they all left the table with a certain relief . They proceeded directly to the bluedraped sitting room and got down to business . " The others are n't really all that significant , " Caalador told them . " Rebal , Sabre , and Baron Parok are decidedly second-rate . All they 're really doing is exploiting existing hostilities . Scarpa 's something quite different , though . Arjuna 's a troublesome sort of place to begin with , and Scarpa 's using that to the fullest . The others have to be fairly circumspect because the Elene kingdoms of western Tamuli are so wellpopulated . There are people everywhere , so the conspirators have to sneak around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Scar-pa 's got places to hide , and places he can defend . He makes some small pretense at nationalism in the way that the others do , but that  | does n't appear to be his main agenda . The Arjuni are far more shrewd than the Elene peasants and serfs of the west . " " Have you got any background on him ? " Ulath asked , " where he came from , what he did before he set up shop , that sort of thing ? " Caalador nodded . " That part was n't very difficult . Scarpa was fairly well known in some circles before he joined the conspiracy . " Caalador made a face . " I wish there were some other word . Conspiracy ' sounds so melodramatic . " He shrugged . " Anyway , Scarpa 's a bastard . " " Caalador ! " Bevier said sharply , " there are ladies present ! " " It was n't intended as an obscenity , Sir Bevier , merely as a legal definition . Scarpa 's the result of a dalliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Styric . It was an odd sort of pairing-off , and it produced a very odd sort of fellow . " " Do n't pursue this too far , Caalador , " Stragen said ominously . " Grow up , Stragen . You 're not the only one with irregular parentage . When you get right down to it , I 'm not entirely sure who my father was , either . Bastardy 's no great inconvenience for a man with brains and talent . " " Milord Stragen 's oversensitive about his origins , " Baroness Melidere explained lightly . " I 've spoken with him time and again about it , but he still has feelings of inadequacy . It might not be a bad thing , though . He 's so generally stupendous otherwise that a little bit of insecurity keeps him from being unbearable . " Stragen rose and bowed flamboyantly . " Oh , sit down , Stragen , " she said . " Where was I ? " Caalador said . " Oh , yes , now I recollect . This yere Scarpa feller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ar-juna , an ' he done all the sorta thangs which it iz ez bastards does in ther formative years in a place ' thout no real moral restraints on ' em . " " Please , Caalador , " Stragen sighed . " Just entertaining the queen , old boy . " Caalador shrugged . " She pines away without periodic doses of down-home folksiness . " " What does shack-nasty mean , Caalador ? " Ehlana interrupted him . " Why , jist whut it sez , yer Queenship . A shack 's a kinda th'owed - together hovel built outten ole boards an ' scraps , an ' nasty means purty much whut it sez . I knowed a feller as went by that name when I wuz a pup . He lived in th ' messiest place y ' ever did see , an ' he wam't none too clean his ownself , neither . " " I think I can survive for several hours now without any more  | mangled language , Master Caalador . " She smiled . " I want to thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be of service , your Majesty . " He grinned . " Scarpa grew up in a situation that sort of skirted the edges of crime . He was what you might call a gifted amateur . He never really settled down into one given trade . " He made a face . " Dabblers . I absolutely detest dabblers . Anyway , he pandered for his mother  --  just as every good boy should  --  and also for his numerous half sisters , who , if we 're to believe the common gossip , were all whores from the cradle . He was a moderately competent pickpocket and cutpurse , and a fairly gifted swindler . Unlike many of his mother 's one-time paramours , Scarpa 's Styric father stayed around for a time , and he used to drop back to visit his son from time to time , so Scarpa got a smattering of a Styric education . Eventually , however , he made the kind of mistake we expect amateurs to make . He tried to cut the purse of a tavern patron who was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended victim grabbed him , and Scarpa demonstrated the Arjuni side of his nature . He whipped out a small , very sharp knife and spilled the fellow 's guts out on the floor of the tavern . Some busybody went to the police about it , and Scarpa left home rather abruptly . " " Wise move , " Talen murmured . " Did n't he get any professional training while he was growing up ? " " No . He appears to have picked things up on his own . " " Precocious . " Caalador nodded his agreement . " If he 'd had the right teachers , he probably could have become a master thief . After he ran away , he seems to have kept moving for a couple of years . He was only twelve or so when he killed that first man , and when he was about fourteen , he turned up in a traveling carnival . He billed himself as a magician ? the usual sort of carnival fakery  --  although he occasionally utilized a few Styric spells to perform real magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Tamul races , since Tamul men do n't have much facial hair . Neither do Styrics for that matter , now that I think about it . Scarpa 's a half-breed , and the mixture of Southern Tamul and Styric came out rather peculiarly . Neither his features nor some of his traits are really characteristic of either race . " Caalador reached inside his doublet and drew out a folded sheet of paper . " Here , " he said , opening the paper , " judge for yourselves . " The drawing was a bit crude  --  more a caricature than a portrait . It was a depiction of a man with a strangely compelling face . The eyes  | were deep-sunk under heavy brows . The cheekbones were high and prominent , the nose aquiline , and the mouth sensual . The beard appeared to be dense and black , and it was meticulously trimmed and shaped . " He spends a lot of time on that beard , " Kalten observed . " It looks as if he shaves off stray whiskers hair by hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for some reason  --  something around the eyes , I think . " " I 'm surprised you can even recognize the fact that it 's supposed to be a picture of a human being , " Talen sniffed . " The technique 's absolutely awful . " " The girl has n't had any training , Talen , " Caalador defended the artist . " She 's gifted in her own profession , though . " " Which profession is that , Master Caalador ? " Ehlana asked . " She 's a whore , your Majesty . " He shrugged . " The drawing is just a sideline . She likes to keep pictures of her customers . She studies their faces during the course of her business transactions , and some of the portraits have strange expressions . " " May I see that ? " Sephrenia asked suddenly . " Of course , Lady Sephrenia . " Caalador looked a little surprised as he took the drawing to her . Then he returned to his seat . " Did you ever meet Djukta , Sparhawk ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a beard for you . Djukta looks like an ambulatory shrub . He 's even got whiskers on his eyelids . Anyhow , Scarpa traveled with the carnival for several seasons , then about five years back , he dropped out of sight for a year or so . When he returned , he went into politics  --  if that 's what you want to call it . He makes some small pretense at nationalism in the same way that Rebal , Parok , and Sabre do , but that 's only for the benefit of the truly ignorant down in Arjuna . The national hero there was the man who established the slave trade , a fellow named Sheguan . That 's a fairly contemptible sort of thing , so not many Arjunis take much pride in it . " " They still practice it , though , " Mirtai said bleakly . " They do indeed , little dorlin ' , " Caalador agreed . " Friend Caalador , " Kring said , " I thought we agreed that you were n't going to call Mirtai that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuthin ' , Kring . It 's jist muh folksy way o ' settin ' people at ther ease . " He paused . " Where was I ? " he asked .  | " You were starting to get to the point , " Stragen replied . " Testy this morning , are n't we , old boy ? " Caalador said mildly . " From what our people were able to discover , Scarpa 's far more dangerous than those three enthusiasts in western Tamuli . Arjuni thieves are more devious than run-of-the-mill criminals , and a number of them have infiltrated Scarpa 's apparatus for fun and profit . The Arjuni are an untrustworthy people , so the empire 's been obliged to deal with them quite firmly . Arjuni hatred for the Tamuls is very real , so Scarpa has n't had to stir it up artificially . " Caalador tugged at his nose a bit dubiously . " I 'm not altogether sure how much of this we can believe ? the Arjuni being what they are and all  --  but one highway robber down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle for a while . He told us that our man 's just a little deranged . He operates out of the ruins of Natayos down in the southern jungles . The town was destroyed during the Atan invasion back in the seventeenth century , and Scarpa does n't so much hide there as he does occupy the place  --  in a military sense of the word . He 's reinforced the crumbling old walls so that the town 's defensible . Our highwayman reports that Scarpa starts raving sometimes . If we can believe our informant , he started talking about the Cyrgai once , and about Cyrgon . He tells his cronies that Cyrgon wants to make his people the masters of the world , but that the Cyrgai , with that institutionalized stupidity of theirs , are n't really intelligent enough to govern a global empire . Scarpa does n't have any problems with the idea of an empire . He just does n't like the way the present one 's set up . He 'd be more than happy with it if there were just a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cyrgai will conquer the world and then retreat back into their splendid isolation . Somebody 's going to have to run the government of the world for them , and Scarpa 's got a candidate in mind for the position . " " That 's insane ! " Bevier exclaimed . " I think I already suggested that , Sir Knight . Scarpa seems to think he 'd make a very good emperor . " " The position 's already been filled , " Sarabian noted dryly . " Scarpa 's hoping that Cyrgon will vacate it , your Majesty . He tells his people that the Cyrgai have absolutely no administrative skills and that they 're going to need someone to run the conquered territories for them . He 'll volunteer at that point . He 'll genuflect perfunctorily in Cyrgon 's direction once in a while , and more or less run things to suit himself . He has large dreams , I 'll give him that . "  | " It has a sort of familiar ring to it , does n't it , Sparhawk ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martel  --  and Annias  --  have the same sort of notion ? " " Oh , my goodness , yes , " Ehlana agreed . " I feel as if I 've lived through all of this before . " " Where does Krager fit in ? " Sparhawk asked . " Krager seems to be some sort of coordinator , " Caalador replied . " He serves as a go-between . He travels a great deal , carrying messages and instructions . We 're guessing about this , but we think that there 's a layer of command between Cyrgon and the people like Scarpa , Parok , Rebal , and Sabre . Krager 's known to all of them , and that authenticates his messages . He seems to have found his natural niche in life . Queen Ehlana tells us that he served Martel and Annias in exactly the same way , and he was doing the same kind of thing back in Eosia when he was carrying Count Gerrich 's instructions to those bandits in the mountains east of Cardos . " " We should really make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulath rumbled . " He starts talking if someone so much as gives him a harsh look , and he knows a great deal about things that make me moderately curious . " " That 's how he 's managed to stay alive for so long , " Kalten grunted . " He always makes sure that he 's got so much valuable information that we do n't dare kill him . " " Kill him after he talks , Sir Kalten , " Khalad said . " He makes us promise not to . " " So ? " " We 're knights , Khalad , " Kalten explained . " Once we give someone our oath , we 're obliged to keep our word . " " You were n't thinking of knighting me at any time in the immediate future , were you , Lord Vanion ? " Khalad asked . " It might be just a little premature , Khalad . " " That means that I 'm still a peasant , does n't it ? " " Well  --  technically , maybe . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chill little smile . " Go ahead and catch him , Sir Kalten . Promise him anything you have to in order to get him to talk . Then turn him over to me . Nobody expects a peasant to keep his word . " " I 'm going to like this young man , Sparhawk . " Kalten grinned .  | " Zalasta 's coming for me , Sparhawk , " Sephrenia told the big Pandion . " He 'll escort me safely back to Sarsos . " She shook her head , refusing to enter the room to which they were returning after lunch . " You 're being childish . You know that , do n't you , Sephrenia ? " " I 've outlived my usefulness , and I 've been around Elenes long enough to know what a prudent Styric does when that happens . As long as a Styric 's useful , she 's relatively safe among Elenes . Once she 's served her purpose , though , her presence starts to be embarrassing , and you Elenes deal abruptly with inconvenient people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife between my ribs . " " Are you just about finished ? Conversations like this bore me . We love you , Sephrenia , and it has nothing to do with whether or not you 're useful to us . You 're breaking Vanion 's heart . You know that , too , do n't you ? " " So ? He broke mine , did n't he ? Take your problems to Xanetia , since you 're all enamored of her . " " That 's beneath you , little mother . " Her chin came up . " I think I 'd rather you did n't call me that anymore , Sparhawk . It 's just a bit grotesque in the present circumstances . I 'll be in my room  --  if it 's still mine . If it is n't , I 'll go live in the Styric community here in Matherion . If it 's not too much trouble , let me know when Zalasta arrives . " And she turned and walked down the corridor , ostentatiously wearing her injury like a garment . Sparhawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alean coming down the tiled hallway . At least that particular problem had been resolved . The queen 's maid had laughed in Kalten 's face when the blond knight had clumsily offered to step aside so that she could devote her attentions to Berit . She had then , Sparhawk gathered , convinced Kalten that her affections were still quite firmly where they were supposed to be . " But you never leave her side , Sir Kalten , " the doe-eyed girl accused . " You 're always hovering over her and making certain that she has everything she needs or wants . " " It 's a duty , Alean , " Kalten tried to explain . " I 'm not doing it because I have any kind of affection for her . " " You 're performing your duty just a little too well to suit me , Sir Knight . " Alean 's voice , that marvelous instrument , conveyed a whole range of feelings . The girl could speak volumes with only the slightest change of key and intonation .  | " Oh , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get caught in these personal matters ? This time , however , he moved quickly to put a stop to things before they got out of hand . He stepped out into the corridor to confront the pair of them . " Why do n't we take care of this right now ? " he suggested bluntly . " Take care of what ? " Kalten demanded . " This is n't any of your business , Sparhawk . " " I 'm making it my business . Are you satisfied that Alean does n't have any kind of serious feelings for Berit ? " Kalten and the girl exchanged a quick , guilty sort of glance . " Good , " Sparhawk said . " My congratulations to you both . Now , let 's clear up this Xanetia business . Kalten was telling you the truth , Alean  --  as far as he went . His duty obliges him to stay close to her because he 's required to make certain that no harm comes to her . We have an agreement with her people , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't go back on their word . We all know that if the Delphae betray us in any way , Kalten will kill Xanetia . That 's why he 's staying so close to her . " " Kill ? " The girl 's huge eyes went even wider . " Those are the rules , Alean . " Kalten shrugged . " I do n't like them very much , but I have to follow them . " " You would n't ! " " Only if I have to , and I would n't like it very much . That 's what the word hostage means , though . I always seem to be the one who gets these dirty jobs . " " How could you ? " Alean said to Sparhawk . " How could you do this to your oldest friend ? " " Military decisions are hard sometimes , " Sparhawk told her . " Are you satisfied now that Kalten 's not straying ? You do know , do n't you , that when he thought that you 'd fallen in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get himself killed ? " " You did n't have to tell her that , Sparhawk , " Kalten protested . " You idiot ! " Alean 's voice climbed effortlessly into the upper ranges . She spoke  --  at length  --  to Sparhawk 's friend while he stood hanging his head and scuffing his feet like a schoolboy being scolded . " Ah ? " Sparhawk ventured . " Why do n't the two of you go someplace private where you can discuss things ? " " With your leave , Prince Sparhawk , " Alean agreed with an abrupt little curtsy . " You , " she snapped to Kalten , " come with me. "  | " Yes , dear , " Kalten said submissively , and the two went on back up the corridor . " Was that Alean just now ? " Baroness Melidere asked , sticking her head out through the doorway . " Yes , " Sparhawk replied . " Where are she and Kalten going ? " she asked , looking after the pair . " They have something important to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're discussing in here ? " " They seem to think so , Baroness . We can manage without them this afternoon , I expect , and it 's a matter that needs clearing up . " " Oh , " she said , " one of those . " " I 'm afraid so . " " Alean will straighten it out , " Melidere said confidently . " I 'm sure she will . How 's your campaign going , Baroness ? I 'm not trying to pry , you understand . It 's just that these matters break my concentration , and I kind of like to have them out of the way so they do n't come bubbling to the surface when I least expect them to . " " Everything 's on schedule , Prince Sparhawk . " " Good . Have you told him ? " " Of course not . He does n't need to know yet . I 'll break it to him gently when the time comes . It 's actually kinder that way . If he finds out too soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your Highness . I know exactly what I 'm doing . " " There 's something I 'd sort of like to get cleared up before we go on , Anarae , " Stragen said to Xanetia . " The Tamuls all believe that the Cyrgai were extinct , but Krager and Scarpa say otherwise . " " The Cyrgai want the world to believe that they are no more , " she replied . " After their disastrous march on Sarsos , they returned home and concentrated for a time on replenishing their subordinate forces , the Cynesgans , which forces had been virtually annihilated by the Styrics . " " So we 've heard , " Caalador said . " We were told that the Cyrgai concentrated with such single-mindedness that their own women were past child-bearing age before they realized their mistake . " " Thine informant spoke truly , Master Caalador , and it is the coin- " non belief in Tamuli that the Cyrg race died out some ten eons ago . That common belief , however , is in error . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not , however , take the blind  | obedience of his people into account when he commanded them to devote their attentions to the women of the Cynesgans . But when he saw that his chosen race was dying out , he did alter the natural course of such things , and aged Cyrgai women became fertile once more  --  though most died in childbirth . Thus were the Cyrgai perpetuated . " " Pity , " Oscagne murmured . " Knowing , however , that the diminished numbers of his worshippers and the Styric curse which imprisoned them in their arid homeland did imperil them , Cyrgon sought to protect his people . The Cynesgans were commanded to confirm and perpetuate the belief of the other races of Tamuli that the Cyrgai were no more , and the dread city of Cyrga itself was concealed from the eyes of men . " " In the same way that Delphaeus is concealed ? " Vanion guessed . " Nay , my Lord . We are more subtle than Cyrgon . We conceal Delphaeus by misdirection . Cyrgon hides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enchantment . Thou couldst go to those highlands and ride close by Cyrga and never see it . " " An invisible city ? " Talen asked her incredulously . " The Cyrgai can see it , " she replied , " and , when it doth suit them so , their Cynesgan underlings can as well . To all others , however , Cyrga is not there . " " The tactical advantages of that must be enormous , " Bevier noted in his most professional tone . " The Cyrgai have an absolutely secure stronghold into which they can retreat if things go wrong . " " Their advantage is offset , however , " Xanetia pointed out . " They may freely ravage and despoil Cynesga , which is theirs already , and which is no more than a barren waste at best ; but they may not , pass the boundaries of their homeland . The curse of the Styrics is still potent , I do assure thee . It is the wont of the kings of the Cyrgai to periodically test that curse . Aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commanded to attempt a crossing . They die in midstride as they obediently march across the line . " Sarabian was looking at her , his eyes narrowed shrewdly . " Prithee , Anarae , advise me in this matter . Thou hast said that the Cynesgans are subject to the Cyrgai ? " " Yes , Majesty . " " All Cynesgans ? " " Those in authority , Imperial Sarabian . " " The king ? The government ? The army ? " She nodded .  | " And their ambassadors as well ? " Oscagne added . " Very good , Oscagne , " Itagne murmured to his brother . " Very , very good . " " I did n't quite follow that , " Ulath admitted . " I did , " Stragen told him . " We 'd probably better look into that , Caalador . " " I 'll see to it . " " Do you know what they 're talking about , friend Engessa ? " Kring asked . " It 's not all that complicated , Kring , " Ehlana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of people who take their orders from the Cyrgai . I 'd guess that if we were to look into the matter , we 'd find that the headquarters of the recent attempt to overthrow the emperor was located in that embassy . " " And if he 's not out of town , we might even find Krager there as well , " Khalad mused . " Talen , how long would it take you to teach me how to be a burglar ? " " What have you got in mind ? " Sparhawk asked his squire . " I thought I might creep into that embassy and steal Krager , my Lord . Since Anarae Xanetia can tell us what he 's thinking , we would n't even have to break his fingers to make him talk  --  or make him any inconvenient promises that we probably did n't intend to keep anyway . " " I sense thy discontent , Anakha , " Xanetia said later when she , Sparhawk , and Danae had returned to the fortified roof of the central tower of Ehlana 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said sourly . " I do not recognize the expression . " " He means that he 's been duped , " Danae translated , " and he 's being impolite enough to imply that I have , too . " She gave her father a smug little smile . " I told you so , Sparhawk . " " Spare me , please . " " Oh , no , Father . I 've got this wonderful chance to gloat . You 're not going to rob me of it . If I remember correctly  --  and I do  --  I was against the idea of retrieving Bhelliom from the very beginning . I knew that it was a mistake , but you bullied me into agreeing . He ignored that . " Was any of it real ? The Troll-Gods ? Drychtnath ? The monsters ? Or was it all just some elaborate game designed to get me to bring Bhelliom to Tamuli ? "  | " Some of it may have been real , Sparhawk , " she replied , " but you 've probably put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It is thy belief that Cyrgon deceived thee into bringing Bhelliom within his reach , Anakha ? " Xanetia said . " Why bother to ask , Anarae ? You know what I 'm thinking already . Cyrgon believes that he could use Bhelliom to break that curse so that his people could start invading their neighbors again . " " I told you so , " Danae reminded him again . " Please . " He looked out over the glowing city . " I think I need a divine opinion here , " he said . " Up until very recently , we all believed that Bhelliom was just a thing  --  powerful , but just an object . We know that 's not true now . Bhelliom has its own personality and its own will . It 's more of an ally than just a weapon . Not only that  --  and please do n't be offended , Aphrael  --  in some ways it 's even more powerful than the Gods of this world . " " I am offended , Sparhawk , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that I told you so . " He laughed , swept her up into his arms , and kissed her . " I love you , " he told her , still laughing . " Is n't he a nice boy ? " Danae said to Xanetia . The Delphaeic woman smiled . " If we did n't know about Bhelliom 's awareness  --  and its will  --  could Cyrgon have known ? I do n't think Azash did . Speaking as a Goddess , would you want to pick up something that could make its own deci-sions  --  and might just decide that it did n't like you all that much ? " " I would n't , " she replied . " Cyrgon might be a different matter , though . He 's so arrogant that he might believe that he could control Bhelliom even against its will . " " But he could n't , could he ? Azash thought he could control Bhelliom by sheer force . He was n't even interested in the rings . The rings can compel Bhelliom  --  because they 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Azash was ? " " Sparhawk , you 're talking about one of my distant relatives . Please be a little more respectful . " Danae 's brow furrowed with thought . She absently kissed her father . " Do n't do that , " he said . " This is serious . " " I know . It helps me to think . Bhelliom 's never made itself known before . You 're probably right , Sparhawk . Azash was n't really very bright . Cyrgon has the same sort of personality , and he 's made several blunders in the past . That 's one of the drawbacks of divinity . We don '  | have to be intelligent . We all know about Bhelliom 's power , but I do n't think any of us have ever come to grips with the notion of its will before . Did it really talk to Sparhawk the way he said it did , Xanetia ? As an equal , I mean ? " " As at least an equal , Goddess , " Xanetia replied . " Bhelliom and Anakha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Where are we going with this , Sparhawk ? " Danae asked . " I 'm not sure . Cyrgon may have made another of those blunders , though . He may just have tricked me into bringing back the one thing that could defeat him . I think we may have an advantage here , but we should probably give a great deal of thought to just exactly how we 're going to use it . " " You 're hateful , Sparhawk , " Danae said . " I beg your pardon ? " " You 've just taken all the fun out of all the I told you so 's I 've been saving up . " Zalasta arrived in Matherion two days later . After only the briefest of greetings to the rest of them , he went immediately to Sephrenia 's room . " He 'll straighten it out , Vanion , " Sparhawk assured the preceptor . " He 's her oldest friend , and he 's far too wise to be infected with irrational prejudice . " " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was gloomy . " I thought she was too wise , and look what happened . This blind hatred may infect the entire Styric race . If Zalasta feels the same way Sephrenia does , all he 's going to do is reinforce her prejudices . " Sparhawk shook his head . " No , my friend . Zalasta 's above that . He has no reason to trust Elenes either , but he was willing to help us , was n't he ? He 's a realist , and even if he does share her feelings , he 'll suppress them in the name of political expediency . And if I 'm right , he 'll persuade her to do the same . She does n't have to like Xanetia . All she has to do is accept the fact that we need her . Once Zalasta convinces her of that , the two of you will be able to patch things up . " " Maybe . " It was several hours later when Zalasta emerged alone from Se-phrenia 's room with his rough-hewn Styric face somber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said when the two of them met in the corridor outside . " She is deeply wounded . I can not understand what Aphrael was thinking of . "  | " Who can ever understand why Aphrael does things , learned one ? " Sparhawk smiled briefly . " She 's the most whimsical and exasperating person I 've ever known . As I understand it , she does n't approve of Sephrenia 's prejudice , and she 's taking steps . The expression doing something to somebody for his own good ' always implies a certain amount of brutality , I 'm afraid . Were you able to talk any sense into Sephrenia at all ? " " I 'm approaching the question obliquely , your Highness , " Zalasta replied . " Sephrenia 's already been deeply injured . This is n't a good time for a direct confrontation . I was at least able to persuade her to postpone her return to Sarsos . " " That 's something , anyway . Let 's go talk to the others . A lot has happened since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Anarae , " Zalasta said coolly . " I do assure thee , Zalasta of Styricum , they are nonetheless false . None of the Delphae have left our valley for well over an hundred years  --  except to deliver our invitation to Anakha . " " It 's happened before , Zalasta , " Kalten told the white-robed Styric . " We watched Rebal use some very obvious trickery when he was talking to a group of Edomish peasants . " " Oh ? " " It was the sort of thing one sees in second-rate carnivals , learned one , " Talen explained . " One of his henchmen threw something into a fire ; there was a flash of light and a puff of smoke ; then somebody dressed in old-time clothes stood up from where he 'd been hiding and started bellowing in an ancient form of speech . The peasants all thought they were seeing Incetes rising from the grave . " " Those who witnessed the Shining Ones were not so gullible , Master Talen , " Zalasta objected . " And the fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy shrugged . " A skilled fake can make almost anybody believe almost anything  --  as long as they are n't close enough to see the hidden wires . Sephrenia told us that it means that the other side 's a little short on real magicians , so they have to cheat . " Zalasta frowned . " It may be possible , " he conceded . " The sightings were brief and at quite some distance . " He looked at Xanetia . " You are certain , Anarae ? Could there perhaps be some of your people  | who live separately ? Who are cut off from Delphaeus and may have joined with our enemies ? " " They would no longer be of the Delphae , Zalasta of Styricum . We are bound to the lake . It is the lake which cloth make us what we are , and I tell thee truly , the light which doth illuminate us is but the least of the things which do make us unlike all others . " She looked at him gravely . " Thou art Styric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the consequences of markedly differing from thy neighbors . " " Yes , " he agreed , " to our sorrow . " " The decision of thy race to attempt to co-exist with the other races of man may be suitable for Styrics , " she continued . " For my race , however , it hath not been possible . Ye of the Styric race are oft met with contempt and derision , but thy differences are not threatening to the Elenes or Tamuls who are about you . We of Delphaeus , however , do inspire terror in the hearts of all others . In time , methinks , thy race will become acceptable . The wind of change hath already begun to blow , engendered in large measure by that fortuitous alliance betwixt ye and the Church of Chyrellos . The knights of that Church are kindly disposed toward Styricum , and their might shall alter Elenic predispositions . For the Delphae , however , such accommodation is impossible . Our very appearance cloth set us forever apart from all others , and this cloth stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought out Anakha , and we have offered him our aid in his struggle with Cyrgon . In exchange , we have besought him only to raise up Bhelliom and to seal us away from all other men . Then none may come against us , nor may we go against any other . Thus will all be safe . " A wise decision perhaps , Anarae , " Zalasta conceded . " It was a choice which we considered in eons past . Delphaeic numbers are limited , however , and your hidden valley will easily hold all of you . We Styrics are more numerous and more widespread . Our neighbors would not look kindly on a Styric homeland abutting their own borders . We can not follow your course , but must live in the world . " Xanetia rose to her feet , putting one hand on Kalten 's shoulder . " Stay , gentle Knight , " she told him . " I must confer a moment with Anakha in furtherance of our pact . Should he detect falsity in me , he may slay me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and opened it for her . Danae , dragging Rollo behind her , followed them from the room .  | " What is it , Anarae ? " Sparhawk asked . " Let us repair to that place above where we are wont to speak , " she replied . " What I must tell thee is for thine ears alone . " Danae gave her a hard look . " Thou mayest also hear my words , Highness , " Xanetia told the little girl . " You 're so kind . " " We could n't hide from her anyway , Xanetia , " Sparhawk said . " We could go to the top of the highest tower in Matherion , and she 'd fly up to eavesdrop on us anyway . " " Canst thou truly fly , Highness ? " Xanetia looked startled . " Ca n't everyone ? " " Behave yourself , " Sparhawk told his daughter . They climbed the stairs to the top of the tower again and went out onto the roof . " Anakha , I must tell thee a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xanetia said gravely , " but it is truth , none-theless . " " That 's an unpromising start , " Danae observed . " I must speak this truth , Anakha , " Xanetia said gravely , " for it is not only in keeping with our pact , but it doth also have a grave import on our common design . " " I get the feeling that I should take hold of something solid , " Sparhawk said wryly . " As it seemeth best to thee , Anakha . I must advise thee , however , that thy trust in Zalasta of Styricum is sorely misplaced . " " What ? " " He hath played thee false , Anakha . His heart and his mind are Cyrgon's. "  | That 's absolutely impossible ! " Danae exclaimed . " Zalasta loves my sister and me ! He 'd never betray us ! " // " He doth love thy sister beyond measure , God-dess , " Xanetia replied . " His feelings for thee , however , are not so kindly . In truth , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " Sparhawk was a soldier , and soldiers who can not adjust to surprises rapidly do not live long enough to become veterans . " You were n't at Delphaeus , Aphrael , " he reminded the Child-Goddess . " Bhelliom vouched for Xanetia 's truthfulness . " " She 's just saying this to drive a wedge between us and Zalasta . " " I do n't really think so . " A number of things were rapidly falling into place in Sparhawk 's mind . " The alliance is too important to the Delphae for her to endanger it with something that petty , and what she just told us explains several things that did n't make sense before . Let 's hear her out . If there 's some question about Zalasta 's loyalty , we 'd better find out about it right now . Exactly what did you discover in his mind , Anarae ? " " A great confusion , Anakha , " Xanetia said sadly . " The mind of Zalasta might have been a noble one , but it doth stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one desire . He hath loved thy sister since earliest childhood , Goddess , but his love is not the brotherly affection thou hast believed it was . This I know with greater certainty than all else , for it is ever at the forefront of his mind . He doth think of her as his affianced bride . "  | " That 's absurd ! " Danae said . " She does n't think of him that way at all . " " Nay , but he doth think so of her . My sojourn within his thought was brief , therefore I do not as yet know all . As soon as I did perceive his treachery , my pledge bound me to reveal it to Anakha . With more time , I will discover more . " " What prompted you to look into his thought , Xanetia ? " Sparhawk asked her . " The room was full of people . Why choose him  --  or do you just listen to everybody simultaneously ? It seems to me that would be very confusing . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this backward . It might be helpful if I knew how your gift works . Is it like having another set of ears ? Do you hear every thought going on around you  --  all at the same time ? " " Nay , Anakha . " She smiled faintly . " That , as thou hast perceived , would be too confusing . Our ears , will we , nil we , hear all sound . My perception of the thought of others doth require my conscious direction . I must reach out to hear , unless the thought of one who is near me be so intense that it doth become as a shout . So it was with Zalasta . His mind doth scream the name of Sephrenia again and again . In equal measure , moreover , doth his mind shriek thy name , Goddess , and those shrieks are filled with his hatred of thee . In his mind art thou a thief , having stolen away all his hope of joy . " " A thief ? Me ? He was the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister here on this world . She 's mine ! She 's always been mine ! How dare he ? " Danae 's black eyes were flashing , and her voice was filled with outraged indignation . " This is n't one of the more attractive sides of your nature , Divine One , " Sparhawk suggested . " We do n't own other people . " " I 'm not a people , Sparhawk ! I own what I want ! " " You 're just digging yourself in deeper . I would n't pursue it any further . " " But I do , Father . I 've devoted hundreds of years to Sephrenia , and all that time Zalasta 's been sneaking around behind my back trying to steal her from me . " " Aphrael , " he said gently , " you 're an Elene in this particular incarnation , so you 're going to have to stop thinking like a Styric . There are certain things that decent Elenes do n't do , and you 're doing one of them right now . Sephrenia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zalasta , not even to Vanion . Her soul 's her own . " " But I love her ! " It was almost a wail .  | " I 'm not built right for this , " Sparhawk muttered to himself . " How can any human hope to be the father of a Goddess ? " " Do n't you love me , Father ? " Her voice was tiny . " Of course I do . " " Then you belong to me , too . Why are you arguing with me about it ? " " You 're a primitive . " " Of course I am . We 're supposed to be primitive . All these years Zalasta 's been pretending to love me  --  smiling at me , kissing me , holding me while I slept . That wretch ! That lying wretch ! I 'll have his heart for supper for this ! " " No , as a matter of fact , you wo n't . I 'm not raising a cannibal . You wo n't eat pork , so do n't start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , " she said contritely . " I got excited . " " Besides , I think Vanion 's got first claim on Zalasta 's tripes . " " Oh , dear . I completely forgot about Vanion . That poor , poor man . " Two great tears welled up in her eyes . " I 'll spend the rest of his life making this up to him . " " Why do n't we let Sephrenia take care of that ? Just heal the breach between them . That 's the only thing he really wants . " Then Sparhawk thought of something . " It wo n't wash , Xanetia . Zalasta could very well be in love with Sephrenia , but he has n't gone over to Cyrgon . When we encountered those Trolls in the mountains of Atan , he was the one who saved us from them  --  and it was n't just the Trolls . There were worse things there as well . " " The Trolls do not loom large in Cyrgon 's plans , Anakha . The deaths of an hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusion  --  illusion wrought by Zalasta himself to allay certain suspicions in the minds of diverse of thy companions . He sought to win thy trust by destroying those shadows of his own making . " " It does fit , " Sparhawk said in a troubled voice . " Would you ladies excuse me for a moment ? I think Vanion should hear this . It concerns him , too , and I 'd like his advice before I start making decisions . " He paused . " Will you two be all right here  --  together , I mean ? Without someone here to keep you from each other 's throats ? " " All will be well , Anakha , " Xanetia assured him . " Divine Aphrael and I have something to discuss . " " All right , " he said , " but no hitting  --  and do n't start screaming at each other . You 'll wake up the whole castle . " He crossed the parapet to the door and went back down the stairs .  | The meeting in the royal apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend sitting with his face in his hands in a room quite some distance from the one he normally shared with Sephrenia . " I need some help , my friend , " Sparhawk said to him . " There 's something you need to know , and we 're going to have to decide what to do about it . " Vanion raised his grief-ravaged face . " More trouble ? " he asked . " Probably . Xanetia just told me . . . well , I 'll let her tell you about it herself . She and Danae are up at the top of the tower . I think we 'll want to keep this private  --  at least until we decide what steps to take . " Vanion nodded and rose to his feet . The two of them went back out into the corridor and started up the stairs . " Where 's Zalasta ? " Sparhawk asked . " He 's with Sephrenia . She needs him right now . " Sparhawk grunted , not really trusting himself to speak . They found Xanetia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sun was moving down the intensely blue autumn sky toward the craggy western horizon , and the breeze coming in off the Tamul Sea had a salt tang mingled with the ripe odor of autumn . " All right , go ahead and tell him , Xanetia , " Sparhawk said . " Then we 'll decide what to do . " To Sparhawk 's surprise , Vanion did n't waste much time on incredulous exclamation . " You 're sure , Anarae ? " he asked after Xanetia had told him of Zalasta 's duplicity . She nodded . " I have seen his heart , my Lord . He hath played thee false . " " You do n't seem very surprised , Vanion , " Sparhawk said . " I 'm not  --  well , not really . There 's always been something about Zalasta that did n't quite ring true . He had some trouble keeping his face under control when Sephrenia and I first went to Sarsos and moved into her house there . He tried to hide it , but I could tell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his disapproval seemed to go quite a bit further than a generalized kind of moral outrage about unorthodox relationships . " " That 's a delicate way to put it , " Danae observed . " We 've never understood why you humans make such a fuss about that . If two people love each other , they should do something about it , and living together is much more convenient for that sort of thing , is n't it ? " " There are certain ceremonies and formalities customary first , " Sparhawk explained dryly.  | " You mean something like the way the peacock shows off his feathers to the peahen before they start building a nest ? " " Something along those lines . " Vanion sighed . " It seems that Sephrenia does n't admire my feathers anymore . " " Not so , Lord Vanion , " Xanetia disagreed . " She cloth deeply love thee still , and her heart is made desolate by reason of her separation from thee . " " And Zalasta 's with her right now doing everything he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice bleak . " How do you want us to proceed with this , Vanion ? You 're the one most deeply involved here . There 's nothing any of us could say that would convince Sephrenia that Zalasta 's a traitor , you know . " Vanion nodded . " She 's going to have to see it for herself , " he agreed . " How far were you able to reach into his mind , Anarae ? " " His present thought is open to me ; his memories somewhat less so . Proximity and some time should provide opportunity to probe more . " That 's the key , then , " Vanion said . " Ehlana and Sarabian want to start tearing down the government almost immediately . Once that starts , Zalasta 's presence in our inner councils is going to be potentially disastrous . He 'll find out everything we 've got planned . " " Let him , " Danae sniffed . " It 's not going to do him much good after I 'm done with my supper . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little savage here wants to eat Zalasta 's heart , " Sparhawk explained . " While he watches , " the Child-Goddess added . " That 's the whole point of it  --  making him watch while I do it . " " Could she do that ? " Vanion asked . " Probably , " Sparhawk replied . " I wo n't let her , though . " " I did n't ask you , Father , " Danae said . " You did n't have to . I said no . Now let 's drop it . " " When did Zalasta make this arrangement with Cyrgon , Anarae ? " Vanion asked . " That is unclear for the nonce , my Lord , " she replied . " I shall pursue it further . My sense of his thought cloth suggest that their alliance dates back some years and doth involve Bhelliom in some I , ishion . " Sparhawk thought about that . " Zalasta was very upset when he found out that we 'd thrown Bhelliom into the sea , " he recalled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , but let 's wait and see what Xanetia 's able to turn up . Right now , I think we 'd better concentrate on delaying Ehlana and Sarabian until we can devise some way to make Zalasta expose his own guilt . We need to get Sephrenia out from under his influence , and she 's never going to believe that he 's a traitor until she actually sees him convict himself by doing something that proves his treason . " Vanion nodded his agreement . " I think we 're going to have to keep this just among the four of us , " Sparhawk continued . " Zalasta 's very shrewd , and Sephrenia knows all of us better than we know ourselves . If the others have any idea of what we 're doing , they 'll let something slip , and Sephrenia will know about it immediately  --  and Zalasta will know about five minutes after she does . " " I 'm afraid you 're right , " Vanion agreed . " Hast thou a plan , Anakha ? " Xanetia asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the details , though . It 's a little complicated . " Danae rolled her eyes upward . " Elenes , " she sighed . " Absolutely not , " Ehlana said adamantly . " He 's too valuable . We ca n't risk it . " She was sitting near the window with the morning sun streaming in on her and setting her pale hair aglow . " There 's no risk involved , dear , " Sparhawk assured her . " The cloud and the shadow are both gone . Bhelliom and I took care of that once and for all . " There was the flaw . Sparhawk was not entirely positive of that . " He 's right , my Queen , " Kalten agreed . " He tore the cloud to tatters and dissolved the shadow like salt in boiling water . " " I 'd really like to ask Kolata some questions , Ehlana , " Sarabian said . " It does n't make sense to keep feeding him if we are n't going to get any use out of him . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? some sort of assurance that he wo n't be torn to pieces the minute he opens his mouth . " " Are you absolutely sure , Sparhawk ? " Ehlana asked . " Trust me . " Sparhawk reached inside his doublet and took out the box . " My blue friend here can make sure that Kolata remains intact  --  no matter what questions we ask . " He looked at Zalasta . " I 'm going to ask a favor of you , learned one , " he said , keeping his voice casual . " I think Sephrenia should sit in on this . I know that she 'd  | rather wash her hands of the lot of us , but maybe if she listens to Kolata 's confession , she 'll begin to take an interest in things again . It might be just the thing to bring her out of the state she 's in right now . Zalasta 's face was troubled , though he was obviously trying very hard to keep his expression under control . " I do n't think you realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I strongly advise you not to force her to be present when you question Kolata . It will only deepen the rift between her and her former friends . " " I wo n't accept that , Zalasta , " Ehlana told him . " Sephrenia 's a member of the royal council of Elenia . I appointed her to that position when I ascended the throne . Her personal problems are her own business , but I need her here in her official capacity . If necessary , I 'll command her presence , and I 'll send Kalten and Ulath to deliver the command and make sure that she obeys . " Sparhawk almost felt sorry for Zalasta at that point . Their decisions and their requests were all completely reasonable , and try though he might , Zalasta could find no way to avoid agreeing . Kolata 's testimony was almost certain to be an absolute disaster for the first citizen of Styricum , but there was no way he could prevent that testimony without exposing himself as a traitor . He rose to his feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , bowing to Ehlana . He turned and quietly left the blue-draped room . " I do n't understand why you wo n't let us tell him , Sparhawk , " Kalten said . " He is a friend , after all . " " He 's also a Styric , Kalten , " Vanion said smoothly . " We do n't know how he really feels about the Delphae . He might go up in flames It he finds out that Xanetia can pick his thoughts the way Talen picks pockets . " " Sephrenia 's probably told him about it already , Lord Vanion , " Levier pointed out . Sparhawk threw a brief questioning look at Xanetia , framing the question in his thought . She shook her head . For some reason , Sephrenia had not yet told / , ilasta about the Delphaeic woman 's strange capability to delve into the minds of others . " I do n't think so , Bevier , " Vanion was saying . " He has n't shown any reluctance to be in the same room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he does n't know . Now , then , who 's going to ques-  | tion Kolata ? We should probably limit it to just one of us . If we all start throwing questions at him , his thoughts will be so jumbled that Xanetia wo n't be able to make any sense of them . " " Itagne 's skilled at debate and disputation , " Oscagne suggested . " Academics spend hours splitting hairs . " " We prefer to call it meticulous attention to detail , old boy , " Itagne corrected his brother . " Kolata has ministerial rank . " " Not any more , he does n't , " Sarabian said . " Well , he used to , your Majesty . I 'd suggest that we let Oscagne conduct the interrogation . He holds the same rank as Kolata , so he 'll be able to approach him as an equal . " " Might I make a suggestion ? " Stragen asked . " Of course , Milord Stragen , " the emperor said . " Teovin 's been sneaking around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministries of your Majesty 's government . Would n't it be a good idea to make this a formal inquiry instead of a starchamber proceeding ? If all the ministers and the aides are present when we question Kolata , Teovin wo n't have the chance to scramble around and mend his fences . " " It 's an interesting notion , is n't it , Ehlana ? " Sarabian mused . " Very interesting , " she agreed . " We 'll have to postpone the interrogation , though . " " Oh ? " " We 'll want to give your Atan runners a head start . " She looked at him gravely . " This is it , Sarabian . Up until now , it 's only been speculation . Once Kolata starts talking in front of the rest of the government , you 'll be committed . Are you really ready to go that far ? " The emperor drew in a deep breath . " Yes , Ehlana , I think I am . " His voice was firm , but very quiet . " Issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atans loose . " Sarabian swallowed hard . " Are you certain your idea will work , Atan Engessa ? " he asked the towering warrior . " It always has , Sarabian-Emperor , " Engessa replied . " The signal fires are all in place . The word will spread throughout Tamuli in a single night . The Atans will move out of their garrisons the following morning . " Sarabian stared at the floor for a long time . Then he looked up . " Do it , " he said .  | The difficult part was persuading Sarabian and Ehlana not to tell Zalasta about what was happening . " He does n't need to know , " Sparhawk explained patiently . " Surely you do n't mistrust him , Sparhawk , " Ehlana protested . " He 's proved his loyalty over and over again . " " Of course he has . He 's a Styric , though , and this sudden move of yours is going to turn all of Tamuli upside down . There 's going to be absolute chaos out there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereabouts  --  a warning of some kind . It 's a natural thing for him to do , and we ca n't afford to risk letting that information get out . The only thing that makes your plan workable at all is the fact that it 's going to be a total surprise . There are Styrics , and then there are Styrics . " " Say what you mean , Sparhawk , " Sarabian said in a testy voice . " The term renegade Styric means the same thing here in Tamuli as it does in Eosia , your Majesty . We almost have to assume that if we tell Zalasta , we 're telling all of Styricum , do n't we ? We know Zalasta , but we do n't know all the other Styrics on the continent . There are some in Sarsos who 'd sign compacts with Hell itself if they thought it would give them a chance to get even with the Elenes . " " You 're going to hurt his feelings , you know , " Ehlana told him . " He 'll live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's not take even the remotest of risks . " There was a polite tap at the door , and Mirtai stepped into the room where the three of them were meeting . " Oscagne and that other one are back , " she reported . " Show them in please , Atana , " Sarabian told her . There was a kind of suppressed jubilation on the foreign minister 's face as he entered with his brother , and Itagne 's expression was almost identical . Sparhawk was a bit startled by how much alike they looked . " You two look like a couple of cats who just got into the cream , " Sarabian told them . " We 're pulling off the coup of the decade , your Majesty , " Itagne replied . " Of the century , " Oscagne corrected . " Everything 's in place , my Emperor . We left it sort of vague ? ' general meeting of the Imperial Council ' ? that sort of thing . Itagne dropped a few hints . He 's been planting the notion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday . It 's the sort of foolish whim your Majesty 's family is famous for . "  | " Be nice , " Sarabian murmured . He had picked up that particular Elene expression during his stay in Ehlana 's castle . " Sorry , your Majesty , " Oscagne apologized . " We 've passed the whole thing off as a routine , meaningless meeting of the council  --  all formality and no substance . " " May I borrow your throne room , Ehlana ? " Sarabian asked . " Of course . " She smiled . " Formal dress , I suppose ? " " Certainly . We 'll wear our crowns and our state robes . You wear your prettiest dress , and I 'll wear mine . " " Your Majesty ! " Oscagne protested . " The customary Tamul mantle is hardly a dress . " " A long skirt is a long skirt , Oscagne . Frankly , I 'd prefer doublet and hose  --  and , given the circumstances , my rapier . Stragen 's right . Once you get used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If formality 's going to be the keynote , I think you and the others should wear your dress armor , Sparhawk , " Ehlana told her husband . " Excellent idea , Ehlana , " Sarabian approved . " That way they 'll be ready when things turn ugly . " They spent the rest of the day supervising the moving of furniture in the throne room . The Queen of Elenia , as she sometimes did , went to extremes . " Buntings ? " Sparhawk asked her . " Buntings , Ehlana ? " " We want things to look festive , Sparhawk , " she replied with an airy little toss of her head . " Yes , I know . It 's frivolous and even a little silly , but buntings hanging from the walls and trumpet fanfares introducing each of the ministers will set the tone . We want this to look so intensely formal that the government officials wo n't believe that anything serious could possibly happen . We 're laying a trap , love , and buntings are part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plots swarm with details . " " You 're enjoying this , are n't you ? " " Of course I am . Is the drawbridge raised ? " He nodded . " Good . Keep it that way . We do n't want anybody slipping out of the castle with any kind of information . We 'll escort the ministers inside tomorrow , and then we 'll raise the drawbridge again . We want to be in absolute control of the situation . " " Yes , dear . " " Do n't make fun of me , Sparhawk , " she warned .  | " I 'd sooner die . " It was nearly dusk when Zalasta came into the throne room and took Sparhawk to one side . " I must leave , Prince Sparhawk , " he pleaded , his eyes a little wild . " It is a matter of the gravest urgency . " " My hands are tied , Zalasta , " Sparhawk replied . " You know my wife . When she starts speaking in the royal we , there 's no reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in motion , your Highness , things vital to the success of the emperor 's plan . " " I 'll try to talk with her , but I ca n't hold out much hope . Things are fairly well under control , though . The Atans know what to do outside the castle walls , and my Church Knights can handle things inside . There are ministers and other high-level officials whose loyalty is in doubt , you know . We do n't know exactly what the questioning of the Minister of the Interior is going to bring out . We 'll have those people in our hands , and we do n't want them running off to stir up more mischief . " " You do n't understand , Sparhawk ! " The note of desperation was clearly evident . " I 'll do what I can , Zalasta , " Sparhawk said . " but I ca n't make any promises . "  | The Tamul architect who had designed Ehlana 's castle had evidently devoted half a lifetime to the study of Elene buildings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavishly imitated the details without capturing the spirit . The throne room was a case in point . Elene castles have but two purposes  --  to remain standing and to keep out unwanted visitors . Both these purposes are served best by the kind of massive construction one might consider in designing a mountain . Over the centuries , some Elenes have sought to soften their necessarily bleak surroundings by embellishment . The interior braces intended to keep the walls from collapsing  --  even when swept by a blizzard of boulders ? became buttresses . The massive stone posts designed to keep the ceiling where it belonged became columns with ornately carved bases and capitals . The same sort of strength can be achieved by vaulting , and the throne room of Ehlana 's Tamul-built castle was a marvel of redundancy . It was massively vaulted and supported by long rows of fluted columns , and was braced by flying buttresses so delicate as to be not only useless but actually hazardous to those standing under them . Moreover , like everything else in fire-domed Matherion , the entire room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some care , and the gleaming walls were now accented with a riot of color . The forty-foot-long bluevelvet draperies at the narrow windows had been accented with white satin , the walls were decorated with crossed pennons and imitation battle flags , bright runners carpeted the aisles , and the columns and buttresses were bandaged with scarlet silk . The place looked to Spar-  | hawk 's somewhat-jaundiced eye like a country fair operated by a profoundly color-blind entrepreneur . " Garish , " Ulath observed , buffing the black Ogre-horns on his helmet with a piece of cloth . " Garish comes close , " Sparhawk agreed . Sparhawk wore his formal black armor and silver surcoat . The Tamul blacksmith who had hammered out the dents and re-enameled the armor had also anointed the inside of each intricately wrought section and all the leather straps with crushed rose petals in a kind of subtle , unspoken criticism of the armor 's normal fragrance . The resulting mixture of odors was peculiar . " How are we going to explain all the guards standing around Ehlana and Sarabian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain things , Ulath . " Sparhawk shrugged . " We 're Elenes , and the rest of the world believes that we 're barbarians with strange , ritualistic customs that nobody else understands . I am not going to let my wife sit there unprotected while she and Sarabian calmly advise the Tamul government that it 's been dismantled . " " Good thinking . " Ulath looked gravely at his friend . " Sephrenia 's being difficult , you know . " " We more or less expected that . " " She might have an easier time if she could sit next to Zalasta . " Sparhawk shook his head . " Zalasta 's an adviser to the government . He 'll have to be on the main floor with the ministers . Let 's keep Sephrenia off to one side . I 'll have Danae sit with her . " " That might help . Your daughter 's presence seems to calm Sephrenia . I would n't seat Xanetia with them , though . " " I had n't planned to . " " Just making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his signal ? Are we absolutely sure his order got to everybody ? " " He is . I guess the Atans have used signal fires to pass orders along for centuries . " " I 'm just a bit dubious about bonfires on hilltops as a way to send messages , Sparhawk . " " That 's Engessa 's department . It wo n't matter all that much if word had n't reached a few backwaters by sunrise this morning . " " You 're probably right . I guess we 've done all we can , then . I just hope nothing goes wrong . " " What could go wrong ? " " That 's the kind of thinking that fills graveyards , Sparhawk . I 'll go tell them to lower the drawbridge . We might as well get started . "  | Stragen had carefully coached the dozen Tamul trumpeters and the rest of his musicians , concluding the lesson with some horrendous threats and an instructional visit to the carefully re-created torture chamber in the basement . The musicians had all piously sworn to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were to greet the arrival of each minister of the imperial government had been Ehlana 's idea . Fanfares are flattering ; they elevate the ego ; they lull the unwary into traps . Ehlana was good at that sort of thing . The depths of her political instincts sometimes amazed Sparhawk . In keeping with the formality of the occasion , armored Church Knights were stationed at evenly spaced intervals along the walls . To the casual observer , the knights were no more than a part of the decor of the throne room . The casual observer , however , would have been wrong . The motionless men in steel were there to make absolutely certain that once the members of the imperial government had entered the room , they would not leave without permission ; and the drawbridge , which was to be raised as soon as all the guests had arrived , doubly insured that nobody would grow bored and wander off . Sarabian had advised his Elene friends that the Imperial Council of Tamuli had grown over the centuries . At first , the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had included their secretaries ; then their undersecretaries . By now it had reached the point where sub-sub assistant temporary interim undersecretaries were also included . The title " Member of the Imperial Council " had become largely meaningless . The inclusion of such a mob , however , insured that every traitor inside the imperial compound would be gathered under Ehlana 's battlements . The Queen of Elenia was shrewd enough to even use her enemies ' egotism as a weapon against them . " Well ? " Ehlana asked nervously when her husband entered the royal apartment . The Queen of Elenia wore a cream-colored gown , trimmed with gold lame , and a dark blue , ermine-trimmed velvet cloak . Her crown looked quite delicate , a kind of lace cap made of hammered gold inset with bright-colored gems . Despite its airy appearance , however , Sparhawk knew  --  because he had picked it up several times  --  that it was almost as heavy as her state crown , which was locked in the royal vault back in Cimmura . " They 're starting to drift across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agne 's greeting them . He knows everybody of any consequence in the  | government , so he 'll know when our guests have all arrived . As soon as everyone 's inside , the knights will raise the drawbridge . " He looked at Emperor Sarabian , who stood near a window nervously chewing on one fingernail . " It 's not going to be all that much longer , your Maj-esty , " he said . " Should n't you change clothes ? " " The Tamul mantle was designed to cover a multitude of defects , Prince Sparhawk , so it should cover my western clothes  --  and my rapier . I am not going in there unarmed . " " We 'll take care of you , Sarabian , " Ehlana assured him . " I 'd rather do it myself , Mother . " The emperor suddenly laughed nervously . " A bad joke , perhaps , but there 's a lot of truth to it . You 've raised me from political babyhood , Ehlana . In that respect , you are my mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never speak to you again , your Majesty . " " I 'd sooner bite out my tongue , your Majesty . " " What 's the customary procedure , your Majesty ? " Sparhawk asked Sarabian as they stood peering around the edge of the draped doorway into the rapidly filling throne room . " As soon as everybody gets here , Subat will call the meeting to order , " Sarabian replied . " That 's when I enter  --  usually to the sound of what passes for music here in Matherion . " " Stragen 's seen to it that your grand entrance will be truly grand , " Ehlana assured him . " He composed the fanfare him-self . " " Are all Elene thieves artists ? " Sarabian asked . " Talen paints , Stragen composes music , and Caalador 's a gifted actor . " " We do seem to attract talent , do n't we . " Ehlana smiled . " Should I explain why there are so many of us on the dais ? " Sarabian asked , glancing at Mirtai and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a sign of weakness . I 'll enter on your arm , and they 'll all grovel . " " It 's called genuflectory prostration , Ehlana . " " Whatever . " She shrugged . " When they get up again , we 'll be , fitting there with our guards around us . That 's when you take over the meeting . Do n't even let Subat get started . We 've got our own agenda today , and we do n't have time to listen to him babble about the prospects for the wheat harvest on the plains of Edom . How are you feeling ? "  | " Nervous . I 've never overthrown a government before . " " Neither have I , actually  --  unless you count what I did in the Basilica when I appointed Dolmant to the Archprelacy . " " She did n't actually do that , did she , Sparhawk ? " " Oh , yes , your Majesty  --  all by herself . She was superb . " " Just keep talking , Sarabian , " Ehlana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout him down . Do n't even pretend to be polite . This is your party . Do n't be conciliatory or reasonable . Be coldly furious instead . Are you any good at oratory ? " " Probably not . They do n't let me speak in public very often ? except at the graduation ceremonies at the university . " " Speak slowly . You tend to talk too fast . Half of any good oration lies in its cadence . Use pauses . Vary your volume from a shout down to a whisper . Be dramatic . Give them a good show . " He laughed . " You 're a charlatan , Ehlana . " " Naturally . That 's what politics is all about  --  fraud , deceit , char-latanism . " " That 's dreadful ! " " Of course . That 's why it 's so much fun . " The brazen fanfares echoed back from the vaulted ceiling as each minister entered the throne room , and they had the desired effect . The ministers in their silken mantles all seemed slightly awed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places with stately pace and slow , their expressions grave , even exalted . Pondia Subat , the prime minister , seemed particularly impressed with himself . He sat splendidly alone in a crimson-upholstered chair to one side of the dais upon which the thrones stood , looking out imperially at the other officials assembling in the chairs lining both sides of the broad central aisle . Chancellor of the Exchequer Gashon sat with Teovin , the Director of the Secret Police , and several other ministers . There seemed to be a great deal of whispering going on in the little group . " That would probably be the opposition , " Ehlana observed . " Teo-vin 's certainly involved , and the others are also most likely a part of it  --  to a greater or lesser degree . " She turned to Talen , who stood directly behind her , wearing his page 's knee britches . " Pay very close attention to that group , " she instructed . " I want a report on their reactions . We should be able to determine their degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , my Queen . "  | Then Itagne appeared briefly at the massive double doors to the throne room and flicked his hand at Ulath , signaling that all of the relevant officials had arrived . Ulath , who stood to one side of the dais , nodded and raised his Ogre-horn trumpet to his lips . The room seemed to shudder into a shocked silence as the barbaric sound of the Ogre-horn , deep-toned and rasping , reverberated from the nacreous walls . The huge doors boomed shut , and two armored knights , one a Cyrinic all in white , and the other a Pandion all in black , placed themselves in front of the entryway . The prime minister rose to his feet . Ulath banged the butt of his ax on the floor three times to call for silence . The emperor winced . " What 's wrong , Sarabian ? " Mirtai asked him . " Sir Ulath just broke several of the floor tiles . " " We can replace them with bone , " she assured him . " There should be quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Will the council please come to order ? " Pondia Subat intoned . Ulath banged the floor again . Sparhawk looked around the throne room . Everyone was in place . Sephrenia , dressed in her white Styric robe , sat with Princess Danae and Caalador on the far side of the room . Xanetia , also in white , sat on the near side with Kalten and Berit . Melidere sat in a small gallery with the nine imperial wives . The clever baroness had carefully cultivated a friendship with Sarabian 's first wife , Cieronna , a member of one of the noblest houses of Tamul proper and the mother of the crown prince . The friendship had by now grown so close that Melidere was customarily invited to attend state functions in the company of the empresses . Her presence among them this time had a serious purpose , however . Sarabian had a wife from each of the nine kingdoms , and it was entirely possible that some of them had been subverted . Sparhawk was fairly certain that the bare-breasted Valesian , Elysoun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too busy for politics . The Tegan wife , Gahenas , a puritanical lady obsessed with her personal virtue and her staunch republicanism , would probably not have even been approached by conspirators . Torellia of Arjuna , and Chacole of Cynesga , however , were highly suspect . They had both established what might best be called personal courts liberally sprinkled with nobles from their homelands . Melidere had been in-  | structed to keep a close eye on those two in particular for signs of unusual reactions to the revelation of Zalasta 's true affiliation . Sparhawk sighed . It was all so complicated . Friends and enemies all looked the same . In the long run , it might turn out that Xanetia 's unusual gift would prove more valuable than a sudden offer of aid from an entire army . Vanion , who had unobtrusively stationed himself with the knights lining the walls , reached up and first lowered , then raised , his visor . It was the signal that all their forces were in place . Stragen , who was with his trumpeters behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather closely at Zalasta , the unknowing guest of honor at this affair . The Styric , his eyes apprehensive , sat among the ministers , his white robe looking oddly out of place among all the bright-colored silk mantles . He quite obviously knew that something was afoot , and just as obviously had no idea what it might be . That was something , anyway . At least no one in the inner circle had been subverted . Sparhawk irritably shook that thought off . Under the circumstances , a certain amount of wary suspicion was only natural ; but left unchecked , it could become a disease . He made a sour face . About one more day of this and he 'd begin to suspect himself . " The council will come now to order ! " Pondia Subat repeated . Ulath broke some more tiles . " By command of his Imperial Majesty , Emperor Sarabian , this council is called to order ! " " Good God , Subat , " Sarabian groaned , half to himself , " will you destroy the floor entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tamuli ! " A single trumpet voiced a clear , ringing theme of majestically descending notes . Then another joined the first to repeat the theme a third of an octave higher  --  then another trumpet another third higher . Then , in a great crescendo and still higher , the musicians all joined in to fill the throne room with shimmering echoes . " Impressive , " Sarabian noted . " Do we go in now ? " " Not yet , " Ehlana told him . " The music changes . That 's when we start . Pay attention to my hand on your arm . Let me set the pace . Do n't jump when we get to the thrones . Stragen 's got a whole brass band hidden in various parts of the room . The climax will be thunderous . Draw yourself up , throw your shoulders back , and look regal . Try your very best to look like a God . "  | " Are you having fun , Ehlana ? " She grinned impishly at him and winked . " There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hall have picked up the theme . That 's our signal . Good luck , my friend . " She kissed him lightly on the cheek and then laid her hand on his arm . " One , " she said , listening intently to the music . " Two . " She drew in a deep breath . " Now . " And the Emperor of Tamuli and the Queen of Elenia stepped through the archway and crossed with regal pace toward their golden thrones as the flutes at the rear of the hall softly sang the plaintive accompaniment of Stragen 's main theme , set now in a minor key . Immediately behind them came Sparhawk , Mirtai , Engessa , and Bevier . Talen , Alean , and Itagne , who was still puffing slightly from running through the halls , followed . As the royal party reached the thrones , Stragen , who was using his rapier as a conductor 's baton , led his hidden musicians into a fortissimo recapitulation of his main theme . The sound was overwhelming . It was not entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their faces out of habit or were knocked down by that enormous blast of sound . Stragen cut his rapier sharply to one side , and the musicians broke off , slashed as it were into silence , leaving the echoes shimmering in the air like ghosts . Pondia Subat rose to his feet . " Will your Majesty address some few remarks to this assemblage before we commence ? " he asked in an almost insultingly superior tone . The question was sheer formality , almost ritualistic . The emperor traditionally did not speak at these sessions . " Why , yes , as a matter of fact , I believe I will , Pondia Subat , " Sarabian replied , rising again to his feet . " So good of you to ask , old boy . Subat gaped at him , his expression incredulous . " But ? " " Was there something , Subat ? " " This is most irregular , your Majesty . " " I know . Refreshing , is n't it ? We 've got a lot to cover today , Subat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not consulted with me . We can not proceed if I do n't know what issues are ? " " Sit , Subat ! " Sarabian snapped . " Stay ! " His tone was one of command . " You will remain silent until I give you leave to speak . " " You ca n't ? " " I said sit down ! "  | Subat quailed and sank into his chair . " Your head 's none too tightly attached just now , my Lord Prime Minister , " Sarabian said ominously , " and if you waggle it at me in the wrong way , it might just fall off . You 've been tiptoeing right on the brink of treason , Pondia Subat , and I 'm more than a little put out with you . The prime minister 's face went deathly pale . Sarabian began to pace up and down on the dais , his face like a thundercloud . " Please , God , make him stand still , " Ehlana said under her breath . " He ca n't make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gazelle in flight . " Then the emperor stopped to stand at the very front of the slightly elevated platform . " I 'm not going to waste time with banalities , gen-tlemen , " he told his government bluntly . " We had a crisis , and I depended on you to deal with it . You failed me  --  probably because you were too busy playing your usual games of politics . The empire required giants , and all I had to serve me were dwarves . That made it necessary for me to deal with the crisis personally . And that 's what I 've been doing , gentlemen , for the past several months . You are no longer relevant , my Lords . I am the government . " There were cries of outrage from the ministers and their subordi-nates . " He 's going too fast ! " Ehlana exclaimed . " He should have built up to that ! " " Do n't be such a critic , " Sparhawk told her . " It 's his speech . Let him make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Sarabian declared . The council paid no attention . They continued their excited babbling . The emperor opened his mantle to reveal his Elene clothing , and then he drew his rapier . " I said SILENCE ! " he roared . All sound ceased . " I 'll pin the next man who interrupts me to the wall like a but-terfly , " Sarabian told them . Then he cut his rapier sharply through the air . The whistling sound of the blade 's passage was as chill as death itself . He looked around at his cowed officials . " That 's a little better , " he said . " Now stay that way . " He set the point of the rapier on the floor and lightly crossed his hands on the pommel . " My family has depended on the ministries to handle the day-to-day business of government for centuries , " he said . " Our trust has obviously been mis-  | placed . You were adequate  --  barely  --  in times of tranquility , but when a crisis arose , you began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fortunes , your personal privileges , and perpetuating your petty interdepartmental rivalries than in the good of my empire ? and that 's the one thing you all seem to forget , gentlemen . It 's my empire . My family has n't made a great issue of the fact , but I think it 's time you were reminded of it . You serve me , and you serve only at my pleasure , not at your convenience . " The officials were all gaping at the man they had thought to be no more than a harmless eccentric . Sparhawk saw a movement near the middle of the throne room . His eyes flicked back to the front , and he saw that Teovin 's chair was conspicuously empty . The Director of the Secret Police was more clever and much quicker than his colleagues , and , throwing dignity to the winds , he was busily crawling on his hands and knees toward the nearest exit . Chancellor of the Exchequer Gashon , thin , bloodless , and wispyhaired , sat beside Teovin 's vacant chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Vanion , and the preceptor nodded . Vanion had seen the crawling policeman , too . " When I perceived that I had chosen little men with little minds to administer my empire , " Sarabian was saying , " I appealed to Zalasta of Styricum for advice . Who better to deal with the supernatural than the Styrics ? It was Zalasta who recommended that I submit a request directly to Archprelate Dolmant of the Church of Chyrellos for assistance , and the very core of that assistance was to be Prince Sparhawk of Elenia . We Tamuls pride ourselves on our subtlety and our sophistication , but I assure you that we are but children when compared to the Elenes . The state visit of my dear sister Ehlana was little more than a subterfuge designed to conceal the fact that our main purpose was to bring her husband , Sir Sparhawk , to Matherion . Queen Ehlana and I amused ourselves by deceiving you  --  and you were not hard to deceive , my Lords  --  while Prince Sparhawk and his companions sought the roots of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our enemies reacted . " There was a brief , muted disturbance at one of the side doors . Vanion and Khalad were quite firmly preventing the Director of the Secret Police from leaving . " Did you have a pressing engagement somewhere , Teovin ? " Sarabian drawled.  | Teovin 's eyes were wild and he looked at his emperor with open hatred . " If you 're discontent with me , Teovin , I 'll be more than happy to give you satisfaction , " Sarabian told him , flourishing his rapier meaningfully . " Please return to your seat . My seconds will call upon you when we 've concluded here . " Vanion took the Director of the Secret Police by one arm , turned him around , and pointed at the empty seat . Then , with a none-toogentle shove , he started him moving . " This windy preamble 's beginning to bore me , gentlemen , " Sarabian announced , " so why do n't we get down to cases ? The attempted coup here in Matherion was the direct response to Sir Sparhawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atans running from one end of the continent to the other for the past several years have had one source and only one . We have a single enemy , and he has formed a massive conspiracy designed to overthrow the government and to wrest my throne from me , and  --  as I probably should have anticipated , given the nature of those who pretend to serve me  --  he had willing helpers in the government itself . " Some of the dignitaries gasped ; others looked guilty . " Pay very close attention , gentlemen , " Sarabian told them . " This is where it gets interesting . Many of you have wondered at the long absence of Interior Minister Kolata . I 'm sure you 'll be delighted to know that Kolata 's going to be joining us now . " He turned to Ulath . " Would you be so good as to invite the Minister of the Interior to come in , Sir Knight ? " he asked . Ulath bowed , and Kalten rose from his seat to join him . " Minister Kolata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows a great deal about criminal activities , " Sarabian declared . " I 'm absolutely sure that his analysis of the present situation will be enlight-ening . " Kalten and Ulath returned with the ashen-faced Minister of the Interior between them . It was not the fact that Kolata was in obvious distress that raised the outcry from the other officials , however , but rather the fact that the chief policeman of the empire was in chains . Emperor Sarabian stood impassively as his council members shouted their protests . " How am I doing so far , Ehlana ? " he asked out of the corner of his mouth .  | " I 'd have done it differently , " she told him , " but that 's only a matter of style . I 'll give you a complete critique when it 's all over . " She looked out at the officials who were all on their feet talking excitedly . " Do n't let that go on for too long . Remind them who 's in charge . Be very firm about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked at his government and drew in a deep breath . " QUIET ! " he roared in a great voice . They fell into a stunned silence . " There will be no further interruptions of these proceedings , " Sarabian told them . " The rules have changed , gentlemen . We 're not going to pretend to be civilized anymore . I 'm going to tell you what to do , and you 're going to do it . I 'd like to remind you that not only do you serve at my pleasure ; you also continue to live only at my pleasure . The Minister of the Interior is guilty of high treason . You 'll note that there was no trial . Kolata is guilty because I say that he 's guilty . " Sarabian paused as a new realization came to him . " My power in Tamuli is absolute . I am the government , and I am the law . We are going to question Kolata rather closely . Pay attention to his answers , gentlemen . Your positions in government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . Foreign Minister Oscagne is going to question Ko-lata  --  not about his guilt , which has already been established  --  but about the involvement of others . We 're going to get to the bottom of this once and for all . You may proceed , Oscagne . " " Yes , your Majesty . " Oscagne rose to his feet and stood a moment in deep thought as Sarabian sat again on his throne . Oscagne wore a black silk mantle . His choice of color had been quite deliberate . While black mantles were not common , they were not unheard of . Judges and imperial prosecutors , however , always wore black . The somber color heightened the foreign minister 's pallor , which in turn accentuated his grim expression . Khalad came forward with a plain wooden stool and set it down in front of the dais . Kalten and Ulath brought the Minister of the Interior forward and plopped him unceremoniously down on the stool . " Do you understand your situation here , Kolata ? " Oscagne asked the prisoner . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kolata replied quickly . " Break his fingers , Khalad , " Sparhawk instructed from his position just behind Ehlana 's throne .  | " Yes , my Lord , " Khalad replied . " How many ? " " Start out with one or two . Every time he starts talking about Oscagne 's rights  --  or his own  --  break another one . " " Yes , my Lord . " Khalad took the Interior Minister 's wrist . " Stop him ! " Kolata squealed in fright . " Somebody stop him ! " " Kalten , Ulath , " Sparhawk said , " kill the first man who moves . " Kalten drew his sword , and Ulath raised his ax . " You see how it is , old boy , " Oscagne said to the man on the stool . " You 're not universally loved to begin with , and Prince Spar-hawk 's command has just evaporated any minuscule affection anyone here might have had for you . You will talk , Kolata . Sooner or later , you 'll talk . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the other way , but you are going to answer my questions . " Oscagne 's expression had become implacable . " They 'll kill me , Oscagne ! " Kolata pleaded . " They 'll kill me if I talk . " " You 're in a difficult situation , then , Kolata , because we 'll kill you if you do n't . You 're taking orders from Cyrgon , are n't you ? " " Cyrgon ? That 's absurd ! " Kolata blustered . " Cyrgon 's a myth . " " Oh , really ? " Oscagne looked at him with contempt . " Do n't play the fool with me , Kolata . I do n't have the patience for it . Your orders come from the Cynesgan embassy , do n't they ? And most of the time , they 're delivered by a man named Krager . " Kolata gaped at him . " Close your mouth , Kolata . You look like an idiot with it hanging open like that . We already know a great deal about your treason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were first contacted by someone you had reason to trust  --  and most probably someone you respected . That immediately rules out a Cynesgan . No Tamul has anything but contempt for Cynesgans . Given our characteristic sense of our own superiority , that would also rule out an Arjuni or an Elene from any of the western kingdoms . That would leave only another Tamul , or possibly an Atan , or ? " Oscagne 's eyes suddenly widened , and his expression grew thunderstruck . " Or a Styric ! " " Absurd , " Kolata scoffed weakly . His eyes , however , were wild , darting this way and that like those of a man looking for a place to hide . Sparhawk looked appraisingly at Zalasta . The sorcerer 's face was deathly pale , but his eyes showed that he was still in control . It was going to take something more to push him over the edge . The big  | Pandion placed his left hand on his sword hilt , giving Oscagne their prearranged signal . " We do n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawled , recovering from his surprise . " I think you need some encour-agement . " He turned and looked at Xanetia . " Would you be so kind , Anarae ? " he asked her . " Our esteemed Minister of the Interior does n't seem to want to share things with us . Do you suppose you could persuade him to change his mind ? " " I can but try , Oscagne of Matherion , " Xanetia replied , rising to her feet . She crossed the front of the room , choosing for some reason to approach the prisoner from the side where Sephrenia sat rather than the one from which she herself had been watching . " Thou art afeared , Kolata of Matherion , " she said gravely , " and thy fear doth make thee brave , for it is in thy mind that though they who hold thy body captive may do thee great harm , he who hath thy soul in thrall may do thee worse . Now must thou contend with yet an even greater fear . Look upon me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit upon thee the ultimate horror . Wilt thou speak , and speak freely ? " " I ca n't ! " Kolata wailed . " Then art thou lost . Behold me as I truly am , and consider well thy fate , for I am death , Kolata of Matherion , death beyond thy most dreadful imagining . " The color drained from her slowly , and the glow within her was faint at first . She stood looking at him with her chin raised and an expression of deep sadness in her eyes as she glowed brighter and brighter . Kolata screamed . The other officials scrambled to their feet , their faces terrified , and their babbling suddenly shrill . " Sit down ! " Sarabian bellowed at them , " and be silent ! " A few of them were cowed into obedience . Most , however , were too frightened . They continued to shrink back from Xanetia , crying out in shrill voices . " My Lord Vanion , " Sarabian called over the tumult , " would you please restore order ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his visor , pulled his sword from its scabbard , and raised his shield . " Draw swords ! " He barked the command . There was a steely rasp as the Church Knights drew their swords . " Forward ! " Vanion ordered . The knights posted along the walls marched clankingly forward , their swords at the ready , converging on the frightened officials . Van-  | ion stretched forth his steel-clad arm , extending his sword and touching the tip to the throat of the prime minister . " The emperor told you to sit down , Pondia Subat , " he said . " Do it ! NOW ! " The prime minister sank back into his chair , suddenly more afraid of Vanion than he was of Xanetia . A couple of the council members had to be chased down and forcibly returned to their seats , and one rather athletic one  --  the Minister of Public Works , Sparhawk thought  --  was only persuaded to come down from the drape he 'd been climbing by the threat of Khalad 's crossbow . Order was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned  --  to their seats , however , the Chancellor of the Exchequer was discovered lying on the floor , vacant-eyed and with a large bubble of foam protruding from his gaping mouth . Vanion checked the body rather perfunctorily . " Poison , " he said shortly . " He seems to have taken it himself . " Ehlana shuddered . " Prithee , Anarae , " Sarabian said to Xanetia , " continue thine in-quiry . " " An it please your Majesty , " she replied in that strange echoing voice . She turned her gaze on Kolata . " Wilt thou speak , and freely , Kolata of Matherion ? " She asked . He shrank back in horror . " So be it , then . " She put forth her hand and moved closer . " The curse of Edaemus is upon me , " she warned , " and I bear its mark . I will share that curse with thee . Mayhap thou wilt regret thy silence when thy flesh doth decay and melt like wax from thy bones . The time hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . Who is it who hath stolen thy loyalty from thine appointed master . " Her hand , more surely deadly than Vanion 's sword , was within inches of Kolata 's ashen face . " No ! " he shrieked . " No ! I 'll tell you ! " The cloud appeared quite suddenly in the air above the gibbering minister , but Sparhawk was ready . Half-hidden behind Ehlana 's throne , he had taken off his gauntlet and surreptitiously removed the sapphire rose from its confinement . " Blue-Rose ! " he said sharply . " Destroy the cloud ! " The Bhelliom surged in his hand , and the dense , almost solidappearing patch of intense darkness tattered , whipping like a pennon on a flagstaff in a hurricane , then it streamed away and was gone . Zalasta was thrown back in his chair as his spell was broken . He  | half rose and fell back again , writhing and moaning as the jagged edges of his broken spell clawed at him . His chair overturned , and he convulsed on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! " Kolata shrieked , pointing with a trembling hand . " It was Zalasta ! He made me do it ! " Sephrenia 's gasp was clearly audible . Sparhawk looked sharply at her . She had fallen back , nearly as shaken as Zalasta himself . Her eyes were filled with disbelief and horror . Danae , Sparhawk noticed , was talking to her , speaking rapidly and holding her sister 's face quite firmly in her small hands . " Curse you , Sparhawk ! " The words came out in a kind of rasping croak as Zalasta , aided by his staff , dragged himself unsteadily to his feet . His face was shaken and twisted in frustration and rage . " You are mine , Sephrenia , mine ! " he howled . " I have longed for you for an eternity , watched as your thieving , guttersnipe Goddess stole you from me ! But no more ! Thus do I banish forever the Child-Goddess and her hold on thee ! " His deadly staff whirled and leveled . " Die , Aphrael ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clasped her arms around Spar-hawk 's daughter and turned quickly in her seat , shielding the little girl with her own body , willingly offering her back to Zalasta 's fury . Sparhawk 's heart froze as a ball of fire shot from the tip of the staff . " No ! " Vanion cried , trying to rush forward . But Xanetia was already there . Her decision to approach Kolata from Sephrenia 's side of the room had clearly been influenced by her perception of what lay in Zalasta 's mind . She had consciously placed herself in a position to protect her enemy . Unafraid , she faced the raving Styric . The sizzling fireball streaked through the silent air of the throne room , bearing with it all of Zalasta 's centuries-old hatred . Xanetia held out her hand , and , like a tame bird returning to the hand that feeds it , the flaming orb settled into that hand . With only the faint hint of a smile touching her lips , the Delphaeic woman closed her fingers around Zalasta 's pent-up hatred . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale fingers , and then she absorbed the fiery messenger of death , the light within her consuming it utterly . " What now , Zalasta of Styricum ? " she asked the raging sorcerer . " What dolt thou propose now ? Wilt thou contend with me more at peril of thy life ? Or wilt thou , like the whipped cur thou art , cringe and flee my wrath ? For I do know thee . It hath been thy poi-  | soned tongue which hath set my sister 's heart against me . Flee , master of lies . Abuse Sephrenia 's ears no longer with thy foul slanders . Go . I abjure thee . Go . " Zalasta howled , and in that howl there was a lifetime of unsatisfied longing and blackest despair . And then he vanished .  | Emperor Sarabian 's expression was strangely detached as he looked out over the shambles of his government . Some of the officials appeared to be in shock ; others scurried aimlessly , babbling . Several were clustered at the main door , imploring the knights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face imperturbable , approached the dais . " Surprising turn of events , " he noted as if he were speaking of an unexpected summer shower . He studiously adjusted his black mantle , looking more and more like a judge . " Yes , " Sarabian agreed , his eyes still lost in thought . " I think we might be able to exploit it , however . Sparhawk , is that dungeon down in the basement functional ? " " Yes , your Majesty . The architect was very thorough . " " Good . " " What have you got in mind , Sarabian ? " Ehlana asked him . He grinned at her , his face suddenly almost boyish . " I ai n't a-tellin ' , dorlin ' , " he replied in outrageous imitation of Caalador 's dialect . " I purely would n't want t ' spoil th ' sur-prise . " " Please , Sarabian , " she said with a weary sigh . " Jist you watch , yer Queenship . I 'm a-fixin ' t ' pull off a little koop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me cross , Sarabian . " " Do n't you love me anymore , Mother ? " His tone was excited and exhilarated . " Men ! " she said , rolling her eyes upward . " Just follow my lead , my friends , " the emperor told them . " Let 's  | find out how well I 've learned my lessons . " He rose to his feet . " Lord Vanion , " he called . " Would you be so good as to return our guests to their seats ? " " At once , your Majesty , " Vanion replied . Vanion , forewarned of Zalasta 's treachery , was completely in control . He barked a few short commands , and the Church Knights firmly escorted the distracted officials back to their chairs . " What was he doing ? " Ehlana demanded of her husband in a tense whisper . " Why did he try to attack Danae ? " " He did n't , love , " Sparhawk replied , thinking very quickly . " He was trying to attack Aphrael . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside Sephrenia . " " She was ? " " Of course . I thought everyone in the room saw her , but maybe it was only me  --  and Zalasta . Why do you think he ran away so fast ? Aphrael was right on the verge of jerking out his heart and eating it before his very eyes . " She shuddered . Emperor Sarabian moved to the front of the dais again . " Let 's come to order , gentlemen , " he told them crisply . " We have n't finished here yet . I gather that you were surprised by the revelation of Zalasta 's true position  --  some of you , anyway . I 'm disappointed in you , my Lords  --  most of you for your profound lack of perception , the rest for not realizing that I could see through Zalasta  --  and you  --  like panes of glass . Some of you are traitors , the rest are merely stupid . I have no need of men of either stripe in my service . It is my excruciating pleasure to announce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamuli moved out of their barracks and replaced all imperial authorities with officers from their own ranks . With the exception of Matherion , the entire empire is under martial law . " They gaped at him . " Atan Engessa , " Sarabian said . " Yes , Sarabian-Emperor ? " " Would you be so kind as to eliminate that lone exception ? Take your Atans out into the city and take charge of the capital . " " At once , Sarabian-Emperor . " Engessa 's grin was very broad . " Be firm , Engessa . Show my subjects my fist . " " It shall be as you command , Sarabian-Emperor. "  | " Splendid chap , " Sarabian murmured loudly enough to be heard as the towering Atan marched to the door . " Your Majesty , " Pondia Subat protested weakly , half rising . The look the emperor gave his prime minister was icy . " I 'm busy right now , Subat , " he said . " You and I will talk later  --  extensively . I 'm sure I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your very nose without even disturbing your decades-long nap absolutely fascinating . Now . sit down and be quiet . " The prime minister sank back into his chair , his eyes very wide . " All of Tamuli is under martial law now , " the emperor told his officials . " Since you 've failed so miserably , I 've been obliged to step in and take charge . That makes you redundant , so you are all dis-missed . " There were gasps , and some of the officials , those longest in office and most convinced of their own near-divinity , cried out in protest . " Moreover ? " Sarabian cut across their objections . " ? the treason of Zalasta has cast doubt upon the loyalty of each and every one of you . If I can not trust all , I must suspect all . I want you to search your souls tonight , gentlemen , because we 'll be asking you questions tomorrow , and we 'll want complete truth from you . We do n't have time for lies or excuses or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I strongly recommend that you be forthcoming . The consequences of mendacity or evasion will be very unpleasant . " Ulath took a long honing steel from his belt and began to draw it slowly across the edge of his ax-blade . It made the sort of screech that sets the teeth on edge . " As a demonstration of my benevolence , " Sarabian continued , " I 've made arrangements for you all to be lodged here tonight , and to provide you with accommodations that will give each of you absolute privacy to review your past lives so that you can answer questions fully tomorrow . Lord Vanion , would you and your knights be so good as to escort our guests down to their quarters in the dungeon ? " Sarabian was improvising for all he was worth . " At once , your Majesty , " Vanion replied , clashing his mailed fist against his breastplate in salute . " Ah , Lord Vanion , " Ehlana added . " Yes , my Queen ? " " You might consider searching our guests before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more of them hurting themselves the way the Chancellor of the Exchequer did , now , do we ? " " Excellent suggestion , your Majesty , " Sarabian agreed . " Take all their toys away from them , Lord Vanion . We do n't want them to be distracted by anything . " He paused a moment . " Actually , Lord Vanion , I rather think our guests will be able to concentrate a little better if they have something tangible about them to emphasize their situation . It seems that I read something once to the effect that the prisoners in Elene dungeons wear a kind of uniform . " " Yes , your Majesty , " Vanion told him with an absolutely straight face . " It 's a sleeveless smock made of grey burlap  --  with a bright red stripe painted down the back , so that they can be identified in case they escape . " " Do you suppose we might be able to find something along those lines for our guests ? " " If not , we can improvise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take their jewels away from them as well . Jewels make people feel important , and I want them all to understand that they 're little more than bugs . I suppose you 'd better feed them as well . What do people usually eat in dungeons ? " " Bread and water , your Majesty  --  a little gruel once in a while . " " That should do nicely . Get them out of here , Vanion . The very sight of them is starting to nauseate me . " Vanion barked a few sharp commands , and the knights descended on the former government . Each official had an honor guard of armored men to escort him ? in some cases to drag him  --  down to the dungeon . " Ah  --  stay a moment , Teovin , " the emperor said urbanely to the Director of the Secret Police . " I believe there was something you wanted to say to me ? " " No , your Majesty . " Teovin 's tone was sullen . " Come , come , old boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're in any way offended by anything I 've done here today , spit it out . Milord Stragen will be happy to lend you his rapier , and then you and I can discuss things ; I 'm sure you 'll find my explanations quite pointed . " Sarabian let his mantle slide to the floor . He smiled a chill smile and drew his rapier again . " Well ? " he said . " It would be treason for me to offer violence to your Majesty 's person , " Teovin mumbled .  | " Good God , Teovin , why should that bother you ? You 've been involved in treason for the past several years anyway , so why concern yourself with a few picky little technicalities ? Take up the sword , man . For once  --  just once  --  face me openly . I 'll give you a fencing lesson  --  one you 'll remember for the rest of your life , short though that may be . " " I will not raise my hand against my emperor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really disappointed in you , old boy . You may go now . Vanion took the director 's arm in his mailed fist and half dragged him from the throne room . The Emperor of Tamuli exultantly raised his rapier over his head , rose to his tiptoes , and spun about in a flamboyant little pirouette . Then he extended one leg forward and bowed extravagantly to Ehlana , sweeping his slender sword to the side . " And that , dear mother , " he said to her , " is how you overthrow a government . " " No , Lady Sephrenia , " the queen said flatly a half hour later when they had gathered again in the royal apartment , " you do not have our permission to withdraw . You 're a member of the royal council of Elenia , and we have need of you . " Sephrenia 's pale , grief-stricken face went stiff . " As your Majesty commands . " " Snap out of it , Sephrenia . This is an emergency . We do n't have time for personal concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now we have to try to minimize the damage . " " You 're not being fair , Mother , " Danae accused . " I 'm not trying to be . You 'll be queen one day , Danae . Now sit down , keep your mouth shut , and learn . " Danae looked startled . Then her chin came up . She curtsied . " Yes , your Majesty , " she said . " That 's better . I 'll make a queen of you yet . Sir Bevier . " " Yes , your Majesty ? " Bevier replied . " Tell your Cyrinics to man their catapults . Vanion , put the rest of the knights on the walls and tell them to start boiling the pitch . Zalasta 's on the loose out there . He 's completely lost control of himself , and we have no idea of what forces he has at his command . In his present state , he may try anything , so let 's be ready  --  just in case .  | " You sound like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am , " she replied absently . " It 's one of my titles . Sparhawk , can Bhelliom counter any magic Zalasta might throw at us ? " " Easily , my Queen . He probably wo n't try anything , though . You saw what happened to him when Bhelliom blew his cloud apart . It 's very painful to have one of your spells broken . Sephrenia knows him better than I do . She can tell you whether or not he 's desperate enough to risk that again . " " Well , Sephrenia ? " Ehlana asked . " I do n't really know , your Majesty , " the small Styric woman replied after a moment 's thought . " This is a side of him I 've never seen before . I honestly believe he 's gone mad . He might do almost any-thing . " " We 'd better be ready for him then . Mirtai , ask Kalten and Ulath to bring Kolata in here . Let 's find out just how far this conspiracy goes . " Sparhawk drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out about Danae ? " he asked . " It 's obvious that he knows who she really is . Did you tell him ? " " No . She told me not to . " " That 's peculiar . I 'll talk with her later and find out why . Maybe she suspected something  --  or it might have been one of those hunches of hers . " He thought for a moment . " Could he have been trying to kill you ? It seemed that he was throwing that fireball at Danae , but you might have been his target . " " I could never believe that , Sparhawk . " " At this point , I 'm almost ready to believe anything . " He hesitated . " Xanetia knew about him , you realize . She told us earlier . " " Why did n't you warn me ? " Her tone was shocked . " Because you would n't have believed her . You 're not really inclined to trust her word , Sephrenia . You had to see Zalasta 's treachery for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , you 'll remember . You might want to give that some thought . " " Do n't scold me , Sparhawk , " she said with a wan little smile . " I 'm having a difficult enough time as it is . " " I know , and I 'm afraid nobody can make it any easier for you . " Kolata proved to be very cooperative . His weeks of confinement had broken his spirit , and Zalasta 's obvious willingness to kill him had canceled any loyalty he might have felt . " I really do n't know , " he  | replied to Oscagne 's question . " Teovin might , though . He 's the one who brought Zalasta 's proposal to me originally . " " Then you have n't been involved in this affair since you were first appointed to office ? " " I do n't think this affair , ' as you call it , has been going on for that long . I ca n't say for certain , but I got the impression that it all started about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been recruiting people for longer than that . " " That was just ordinary Tamul politics , Oscagne . I knew that the prime minister was an idiot as soon as I took office . You were my only significant opponent . I was recruiting people to counter your moves ? and your absurd idea that the subject kingdoms of Daresia are foreign nations rather than integral parts of metropolitan Tamuli . " " We can discuss jurisdictional disputes some other time , Kolata . It was Teovin , then ? He 's been your contact with the enemy ? " Kolata nodded . " Teovin and a disreputable drunkard named Krager . Krager 's an Eosian , and he 's had dealings with Prince Sparhawk before , I understand . Everyone in our loose confederation knows him , so he makes a perfect messenger  --  when he 's sober . " " That 's Krager , all right , " Kalten noted . " What exactly did Zalasta offer you , Kolata ? " Oscagne asked the prisoner . " Power , wealth  --  the usual . You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game and the stakes we play for . We all thought that the emperor was no more than a figurehead , well-meaning , a little vague , and not really very well informed  --  sorry , your Majesty , but that 's what we all believed . " " Thank you , " Sarabian replied . " That 's what you were supposed to think . What really baffles me , though , is the fact that you all overlooked the fact that the Atans are loyal to me personally . Did n't any of you take that into consideration ? " " We underestimated your Majesty . We did n't think you grasped the full implications of that . If we 'd thought for a moment that you wally understood how much power you had , we 'd have killed you . " " I rather thought you might have . That 's why I played the sim-pleton . " " Did Zalasta tell you who was really behind all of this ? " Oscagne eked . " He pretended that he was speaking for Cyrgon , " Kolata replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . Styrics are peculiar people . They always try to make us believe that they represent a higher power of some kind . They never seem to want to accept full responsibility . So far as I know , however , it was Zalasta 's scheme . " " I think that maybe it 's time for us to hear from Zalasta himself , " Vanion said . " Have you got him hidden up your sleeve , Vanion ? " Ehlana asked . " In a manner of speaking , your Majesty . Kalten , why do n't you take the Minister of the Interior back to his room ? He looks a little tired . " " I still have questions , Lord Vanion , " Oscagne protested . " We 'll get you your answers , old boy , " Itagne assured him , " quicker and in much greater detail . You plod , Oscagne . It 's one of your failings . We 're just going to hurry things along . " Vanion waited until Kalten and Ulath had removed Kolata from the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of way that Xanetia knows what other people are thinking . This is n't just some vague notion about feelings or moods . If she chooses , she can repeat your thoughts word for word . Most of you probably have some doubts about that , so in the interests of saving time , why do n't we have her demonstrate ? Would you tell us what Queen Ehlana 's thinking right now , Anarae ? " " An it pleases thee , Lord Vanion , " the Delphaeic woman replied . " Her Majesty is enjoying herself very much at the moment . She is , however , discontent with thee for thine interruption . She is pleased with the progress of Emperor Sarabian , thinking it might now be reasonable to expect some small measure of competence from him . She hath , as well , certain designs of an intimate nature upon her husband , for political activity cloth ever stir that side of her per-sonality . " Ehalana 's face turned bright red . " You stop that at once ! " she exclaimed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't anticipate that last bit . Did Xanetia more or less read your thoughts correctly ? " " You know I wo n't answer that , Vanion . " The queen 's face was still flaming . " Will you at least concede that she has access to the thoughts of others ? " " I 'd heard about that , " Sarabian mused . " I thought it was just another of the wild stories we hear about the Delphae. "  | " Bhelliom confirmed it , Emperor Sarabian , " Sparhawk told him . " Xanetia can read others the way you 'd read an open book . I 'd imagine that she 's read Zalasta from cover to cover . She should be able to tell everything we want to know . " He looked at Xanetia . " Could you lye us a sort of summary of Zalasta 's life , Anarae ? " he asked her . " Sephrenia in particular is deeply saddened by what he revealed in he throne room . Maybe if she knows the reason for his actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can speak for myself , Sparhawk , " Sephrenia told him tartly . " I 'm sure you can , little mother . I was just serving as an interediary . You and Xanetia do n't get on too well . " " What 's this ? " Sarabian asked quickly . " An ancient enmity , your Majesty , " Xanetia explained . " So anent , in truth , that none living knoweth its source . " " I know , " Sephrenia grated at her , " and it 's not as ancient as all at . " Perhaps , but hearken unto the mind of Zalasta , and judge for myself , Sephrenia of Ylara . " Kalten and Ulath returned and quietly took their seats again . " Zalasta was born some few centuries ago in the Styric village of lara , which lay in the forest near Cenae in northern Astel , " Xanetia Kan . " In his seventh year was there born also in that selfsame village e whom we know as Sephrenia , one of the Thousand of Styricum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , councillor of Ionia , and beloved of Preceptor Vanion . " " That 's no longer true , " Sephrenia said shortly . " I spoke of Lord Vanion 's feelings for thee , Sephrenia , not of thine r him . Zalasta 's family was on friendly terms with Sephrenia 's , and ey did conclude between them that when Sephrenia and Zalasta mild reach a suitable age , they would be wed . " " I 'd forgotten about that , " Sephrenia said suddenly . " I 've never ally thought of him that way . " " It hath been the central fact of his life , however , I do assure thee . When thou wert in thy ninth year didst thy mother conceive , and the child she bore was in truth Aphrael , Child-Goddess of Styrim , and in the instant of her birth did Zalasta 's hopes and dreams turn to dust and ashes , for thy life was forever given over entirely to Me infant sister . Zalasta 's wrath knew no bounds , and he did hide himself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much he traveled , seeking out the most powerful magicians  | of Styricum , even , at peril of his soul , those outcast and accursed . His search had but one aim , to discover some means whereby a man might overthrow and destroy a God ; for his despair drove him to an unreasoning hatred of the Child-Goddess ; and , more than anything , he sought her death . " Princess Danae gasped aloud . " You 're supposed to be listening , " her mother said . " I was startled , Mother . " " You must never show that . Always keep your emotions under control . " " Yes , Mother . " " It was in the sixth year of the life of the Child-Goddess  --  in that particular incarnation  --  that Zalasta , in a frenzy of frustration , since all with whom he had spoken had told him that his goal was beyond human capability , turned to more direct means . Hoping perhaps that the Child-Goddess might be caught unawares or that by reason of her tender years might she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he a reckless plan , an attempt to o'erwhelm her with sheer numbers . Though the Goddess herself is immortal , thought he that mayhap might her incarnation be slain , forcing her to seek another vessel for her awareness . " " Would that work ? " Kalten asked Sparhawk . " How should I know ? " Sparhawk threw a guarded glance at his daughter . Danae very casually shook her head . " In furtherance of his hasty and ill-conceived scheme did Zalasta assume the guise of an Elene clergyman and did visit the rude villages of the serfs of that region and did denounce the Styrics of his own village , describing them as idolaters and demon-worshippers , whose foul rites demanded the blood of Elene virgins . So hotly did he inflame them with his false reports that on a certain day did the ignorant serfs gather , and swept they down upon that innocent Styric village , slaughtering all and putting their houses to the torch . " " But that was Sephrenia 's home , too ! " Ehlana exclaimed . " How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ? " " He was beyond caring , Queen of Elenia . Indeed , it was his thought that better far should she die than that Aphrael should have her . Better a grief that would pass than endless unsatisfied longing . But as it came to pass , the Child-Goddess had besought her sister that very morning that they two should go into the forest to gather wildflowers ,  | and thus it was that they were not there when the Elene serfs fell upon he village . " Zalasta told me the story once , " Sparhawk interrupted . " He said at he was with Sephrenia and Aphrael in the forest . " " Nay , Anakha . He was at the village , directing the search for the we . " " Why would he lie about something like that ? " " Mayhap he Both lie even to himself . His acts that day were Monstrous , and it is in our nature to obscure such behavior from ourselves . " " Maybe that 's it , " he conceded . " Ye may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou knowest that his own kindred perished there , " Xanetia continued . " Yea , his father and his mother and sisters three fell beneath the cudgels and scythes of the ravening beasts he had unleashed , even as he looked on . " " I do n't believe you ! " Sephrenia burst out . " Bhelliom can confirm my truth , Sephrenia , " Xanetia replied calmly , " and if I have broken faith by lying , Sir Kalten stands ready i spill out my life . Put me to the test , sister . " " He told us that the serfs had been inflamed against our village N your people  --  by the Delphae ! " " He lied unto thee , Sephrenia . Great was his chagrin when he covered that Aphrael  --  and thou  --  didst still live . Seizing upon the first thought which came to him , he did shift his own guilt to my kindred , knowing that thou wouldst surely believe the worst of those hum thou welt already predisposed to hate . He hath deceived thee since childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had k t Anakha forced him to reveal his true self . " " That 's why you hate the Delphae , is n't it , Sephrenia ? " Ehlana eked shrewdly . " You thought that they were the ones responsible for he murder of your parents . " " And Zalasta , ever striving to conceal his own guilt , lost no opportunity to remind her of that lie , " Xanetia said . " In truth hath he poinsoned her thoughts against the Delphae for centuries , filling her hart with hatred , lest she question him concerning his own involve-nt . Sephrenia 's face twisted , and she bowed her head , buried her face her hands , and began to weep . Xanetia sighed . " The truth hath made her grief all new . She weeps  | for her parents , dead these many centuries . " She looked at Alean . " Take her somewhat apart , gentle child , and comfort her . She hath much need of the ministrations of women presently . The storm of her weeping will soon pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her hands . " " Or mine , " Vanion added bleakly . " Boiling oil is good , my Lord , " Kalten suggested . " Cook him while he 's still alive . " " Hooks are good , too , " Ulath added . " Long ones with nice sharp barbs on them . " " Must you ? " Sarabian said with a shudder . " Zalasta hurt Sephrenia , your Majesty , " Kalten told him . " There are twenty-five thousand Pandion Knights  --  and quite a few knights from the other orders as well  --  who are going to take that very personally . Zalasta can pull mountain ranges over his head to try to hide , but we 'll still find him . The Church Knights are n't really very civilized , and when somebody hurts those we love , it brings out the worst in us . ' ' " Well said , " Sparhawk murmured . " We 're getting afield here , gentlemen , " Ehlana reminded them . " We 'll decide Zalasta 's punishment after we catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , Xanetia ? Is he really allied with Cyrgon ? " " The alliance was of Zalasta 's devising , Queen of Elenia . His fail ? ure in the forest of Astel and his own guilt arising therefrom did plunge him into deepest despair and blackest melancholy . He roamed the world , losing himself at times in vilest debauchery and at times dwell ? ing alone and hermitlike in the wilderness of this world for decades on end . He sought out every Styric magician of reputation  --  good of ill  --  and gleaned from them all of the secrets . In truth , of all the Styria who have ever lived in the forty eons of the history of their race , Zalasta is preeminent . But knowledge alone consoled him not . Aphrael lived still , and Sephrenia was ever bound to her . " But the knowledge of Zalasta , which is beyond measure , did suggest to him a means by which he might break those bonds . At the dawn of time in far Thalesia had the Troll-Dwarf Ghwerig wrought Bhelliom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart 's desire . " Then came the birth of Anakha , signaling that Bhelliom itself would soon emerge from the place where it had lain hidden , and by  | signs and oracles and diverse other means did outcast Styrics perceive his birth , and counseled they Zalasta , instructing him to journey straightway to Eosia to observe Anakha throughout his childhood and youth that he might know him better , for it was the hope of Zalasta that in the day that Anakha did bring the flower-gem to light , might he wrest it from him and thereby gain the means to prevail over the Child-Goddess . But on the day when the ring did come into Anakha 's possession , did Zalasta perceive his error . Well had the Troll-Gods wrought when they guided Ghwerig in the carving of the sapphire rose . Man is capricious and inconstant , and covetousness doth ever lurk in his heart , and Trolls are but reflections of the worst in men . Thus did the Troll-Gods make the rings the key to Bhelliom , lest any or all have power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing the rings , and thus did she scatter the power of the jewel that no mortal might command it . Thinking that their own power was absolute , the Troll-Gods had no interest in the flower-gem , and distrustful each of the others , they laid enchantments upon the stone to ensure that no one of them might take up Bhelliom unless all did . Only in concert might they command it , and they contrived it so that they , as Gods acting in concert , could command Bhelliom without the rings . " She paused , reflecting , Sparhawk realized , on the peculiarities of the Troll-Gods . " Now truly , " she went on , " the Troll-Gods are elementals , each so limited that his mind may in no wise be considered whole and complete . Only when united , which doth rarely happen , can they by combination achieve that wholeness we see in the merest human child . For the other Gods , however , it is not so . The mind of Azash was whole and complete , despite his maiming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bhelliom without the rings . This t hen was the peril which did confront thee , Anakha , when thou didst journey to Zemoch to meet with him . Had Azash wrested Bhelliom from thee , he could have compelled it to join its will and its power with his . " " That might have been a bit inconvenient , " Kalten noted . " I do n't quite understand , " Talen said . " The last few times he 's used it , Sparhawk 's been able to get Bhelliom to do what he wants It to do without using the rings . Does that mean that Sparhawk 's a God ? " " Nay , young sir . " Xanetia smiled . " Anakha is of Bhelliom 's devising and is therefore in some measure a part of Bhelliom  --  even as  | are the rings . For him , the rings are not needful . Zalasta did perceive this . When Anakha slew Ghwerig and took up the Bhelliom did Zalasta intensify his surveillance , ever using the rings as beacons to guide him . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he watch Anakha 's mate as well . " " All right , Sparhawk , " Ehlana said in a dangerous tone , " how did you get my ring ? And what 's this ? " She extended her hand to show him the ruby adorning her finger . " Is it some cheap piece of glass ? " He sighed . " Aphrael stole your ring for me , " he replied . " She 's the one who provided the substitute . I doubt that she 'd have used glass . " She pulled the ring off her finger and hurled it across the room . " Give it back ! Give me back my ring , you thief . " " I did n't steal it , Ehlana , " he protested . " Aphrael did . " " You took it when she gave it to you , did n't you ? That makes you an accessory . Give me back my ring ! " " Yes , dear , " he replied meekly . " I meant to do that , but it slipped my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Open , " he told it . He did not touch his ring to the lid . He wanted to find out if the box would open at his command alone . It did . He took out his wife 's ring and held it out to her . " Put it back where it belongs , " she commanded . " All right . Here , hold this . " He gave her the box , took her hand , and slipped the ring onto her finger . Then he reached for the box again . " Not just yet , " she said , holding it out of his reach . She looked at the sapphire rose . " Does it know who I am ? " " I think so . Why do n't you ask it ? Call it Blue-Rose . That 's what Ghwerig called it , so it 's familiar with the name . " " Blue-Rose , " she said , " do you know me ? " There was a momentary silence as Bhelliom pulsed , its azure glow dimming and then brightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden voice , " is it thy desire that I respond to the questions of thy mate ? " " It were well that thou didst , Blue-Rose , " Sparhawk replied . " She and I are so intertwined that her thoughts are mine and mine hers . Whether we will or no , we are three . Ye two should know one an-other. "  | " This was not my design , Anakha . " Talen 's voice had an accusing note in it . " The world is ever-changing , Blue-Rose , " Ehlana said , " and there is no design so perfect that it can not be improved . " Her speech , like Sparhawk 's , was profoundly formal . " Some there are who have feared that I might imperil my life should I touch thee . Is there in truth such peril ? " The wooden expression slid off Talen 's face to be replaced with a look of bleak determination . " There is , mate of Anakha . " The note in Talen 's voice was as hard and cold as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After ages uncounted of lying imprisoned in the earth , I did permit Ghwerig to lift me from the place where I had lain . This shape , which is so pleasing unto thee , was the result . With cruel implements of diamond and accursed red iron did Ghwerig carve and contort me , living , into this grotesque form . I must submit to the touch of a God ; I willingly submit to the touch of Anakha in the sure and certain hope that he will liberate me from this . shape which hath become my prison . It is death for any other . " " Could n't you ? ? " She left it hanging . " No . " There was an icy finality in it . " I have no reason to trust the creatures of this world . The death that lieth in my touch shall remain , and also the lure which doth incline all who see me to touch me . They who see me will yearn to touch me and they will eagerly reach forth their hands  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the living are not to be trusted . " She sighed . " Thou art hard , Blue-Rose , " she said . " I have reason , mate of Anakha . " " Someday , mayhap , we will learn trust . ' " It is not needful . The achievement of our goal doth not hinge upon it . " She sighed again and handed the box back to her husband . " Please go on , Xanetia . That shadow that was pestering Sparhawk and me was Zalasta , then ? At first we thought it was Azash  --  and then , later on , the Troll-Gods . " " The shadow was Zalasta 's mind , Queen of Elenia , " Xanetia replied . " A Styric spell known to very few cloth make it possible for him thus to observe and listen unseen . " " I 'd hardly call it unseen . I saw the edges of him every single time . It 's a very clumsy spell . "  | " That was Bhelliom 's doing . It sought to warn Anakha of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the rings was on thy hand , the shadow of Zalasta 's mind was also visible to thee . " She paused . " Zalasta was afeared , " she went on . " It was the design of the minions of Azash to lure Anakha  --  with Bhelliom in his grip  --  to go even unto Zemoch where Azash might take the jewel from him . Should that have come to pass , Zalasta 's one hope of defeating Aphrael and possessing Sephrenia would have been forever dashed . In truth , Anakha , were all the impediments heaped in thy path to Zemoch of Zalasta 's devising . " " I sort of wondered about that , " Sparhawk mused . " Martel was being inconsistent , and that was n't at all like him . My brother was usually as single-minded as an avalanche . We thought it was the TrollGods , though . They had plenty of reason not to want Bhelliom to fall into the hands of Azash . " " Zalasta wished thee to believe so , Anakha . It was yet another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her good opinion of him was most important . In short , thou didst win thy way through to Zemoch and didst destroy Azash there  --  along with diverse others . " " We did that , all right , " Ulath murmured . " Whole groups of di-verses . " " Then was Zalasta sore troubled , " Xanetia continued , " for Anakha had come to full realization of his power to control Bhelliom , and with that realization had he become as dangerous as any God . Zalasta could no more confront him than he could confront Aphrael . And so it was that he went apart from all other men to consider his best course of action , and to consult with certain outcasts of his acquaintance . The destruction of Azash had confirmed their surmise : Bhelliom could , in fact , confront and destroy the Gods . The means of the death of Aphrael was at hand , could Zalasta but obtain it . That means , however , was in the hands of the most dangerous man on life . Clearly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs ally himself with a God . " " Cyrgon , " Kalten guessed . " Even so , my protector . The Elder Gods of Styricum , as ye have discovered , were powerless by reason of their lack of worshippers . The Troll-Gods were confined , and the Elene God was inaccessible , as was Edaemus of the Delphae . The Tamul Gods were too frivolous , and the God of the Atans too inhospitable to save his own children . That  | Cyrgon , and Zalasta and his cohorts did immediately perceive a ins by which he might strike a bargain with the God of the Cyrgai . With Bhelliom might Cyrgon lift the Styric curse which confined his ildren and unleash them upon the world . In return , Zalasta believed , might Cyrgon be persuaded to permit him to use Bhelliom to destroy phrael , or , at the very least , to raise it against Aphrael with his own divine hand . " " It would have been a reasonable basis for opening negotiations , " agne conceded . " I 'd take that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least . " " Perhaps , " Itagne said dubiously , " but you 'd have to live long ough to get to the table first . I do n't imagine that the appearance a Styric in Cyrga would have moved the population there to enthusiastic demonstrations of welcome . " " It was in truth a perilous undertaking , Itagne of Matherion . By diverse means did Zalasta gain entrance into the Temple of Cyrgon the heart of the hidden city , and there did he confront the blazing irit of Cyrgon himself and stay the God 's vengeful hand with his offer of the liberation of the Cyrgai . The enemies at once became Ilies by reason of their mutual desires , and concluded they that Anakha must be lured to Daresia , for in no wise would they risk confrontation with the God of the Elenes , whose power , derived from his countless worshippers , is enormous . Conceived they then their Involuted plan to disrupt all of Tamuli by insurrection and by apparatition so that the imperial government must seek aid , and Zalasta 's t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention of the government to Anakha and to suggest accommodation with the Church of Chyrellos . The apparitions to be raised were no great chore for Zalasta of Styricum and his outcast comrades ; nor was the deceit whereby Cyrgon persuaded the Trolls that their Gods commanded them to march across the polar ice to the north coast of Tamuli , an impossible task for the God of the Cyrgai . More central to their plans , however , were the insurrections which have so sorely marred the peace of Tamuli in recent years . Insurrection , to be successful , must be tightly controlled . Spontaneous uprisings seldom succeed . I Iistory had persuaded Zalasta that central to the success of their plan would be the character and personality of he who would unite the diverse populations of the kingdoms of the Tamul Empire and fire them with his force and zeal . Zalasta did not have far to seek to find ouch an one . Straightway upon his departure from Cyrga did he jour-  | ney to Arjuna , and there presented he his plan to one known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Zalasta 's plan involved high treason at the very least . It probably involved crimes they have n't even named as yet ? consorting with ye powers of Darknesse ' and the like . How did he know he could trust Scarpa ? " " He had every reason , Stragen of Emsat , " she replied . " Zalasta knew that he could trust Scarpa as he could trust none other on life . Scarpa , you see , is Zalasta 's own son . "  | Sephrenia sat alone on the bed in her room . Her selfimposed isolation , she sadly concluded , would probably continue for the rest of her life . She had spoken in anger and haste , and this empty solitude was the consequence . She sighed . Sephrenia of Ylara . It was strange that both Xanetia and Cedon had reached into the past for that archaic name , and stranger still that it should touch her heart so deeply . Ylara had not been much of a village , even by Styric standards . Styrics had long sought to divert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor , living in hovels and wearing garments of the roughest homespun . But Ylara , with its single muddy street and clay and wattle huts , had been home . Sephrenia 's childhood there had been filled with love , and that love had reached its culmination with the birth of her sister . At the moment of Aphrael 's birth , Sephrenia had found at once fulfillment and life-long purpose . The memory of that small , rude village and its warmth and allencompassing love had sustained her through dark days . Ylara , glowing in her memories , had always been a refuge to which she could retreat when the world and all its ugliness pressed in around her . But now it was gone . Zalasta 's treachery had forever fouled and profaned her most precious memories . Now , whenever she remembered Ylara , Zalasta 's face intruded itself ; and now she saw his face for what It truly was  --  a mask of deceit and lust and a vile hatred for the ChildGoddess who was at the core of Sephrenia 's very being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Zalasta 's corrupt duplicity had forever destroyed it . Sephrenia buried her face in her hands and wept . Sparhawk and Vanion found Princess Danae brooding alone in a large chair in a darkened room . " No , " she replied emphatically to their urgent request , " I will not interfere . " " Aphrael , " Vanion pleaded with tears standing in his eyes , " it 's killing her . " " Then she 'll just have to die . I ca n't help her . She has to do this by herself . If I tamper in any way at all , it wo n't mean anything to her , and I love her too much to coddle her and steal away the significance of what she 's suffering . " " You do n't mind if we try to help her , do you ? " Sparhawk asked her tartly . " You can try if you want  --  as long as you do n't use Bhelliom . " " You 're a very cruel little girl , did you know that ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're not going to change my mind by calling me names , Spar-hawk  --  and do n't try to sneak around behind my back , either . You can hold her hand or give her flowers or kiss her into insensibility if you want , but leave the Bhelliom right where it is . Now go away and leave me alone . I 'm not enjoying this . " And she curled up in her chair with her arms tightly wrapped around the battered Rollo and a look of ancient pain in her dark , luminous eyes . " Zalasta 's been interfering with us for a long time , has n't he , Anarae ? " Bevier asked the following morning when they had gathered once again in the blue-draped sitting room . They all wore more-casual clothing now , and the long table against the far wall was set with a breakfast buffet . Queen Ehlana had discovered a long time ago that meals did not necessarily have to interfere with important matters . Bevier 's blue doublet was open at the front , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of him . " If he 's been behind that shadow and the cloud , that would almost have to mean that he was involved in the Zemoch war , would n't it ? " Xanetia nodded . " Zalasta 's scheming is centuries old , Sir Knight . His passion for Sephrenia dates back to his childhood , as doth his hatred for Aphrael , whose birth did dash all his hopes . Well he knew  | that should he confront the Child-Goddess directly , she could will away his very existence with a single thought . He knew that his lust was unwholesome , and that no God would be inclined to aid him in his struggle with Aphrael . Long he pondered this , and he concluded that his design required aid from some source with power , but without conscience or will of its own . " " Bhelliom , " Sparhawk said . " Or at least that 's how everyone saw it . We know differently now . " " Truly , " she agreed . " Zalasta did share the common misperception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power only . He did believe that Bhelliom , untouched by morality , would obey him without question , and that it would destroy his mortal enemy and thus he could come to possess his heart 's lust  --  for mistake me not , Zalasta sought possession of Sephrenia , not her love . " " That 's vile , " Baroness Melidere said with a shudder . Xanetia nodded her agreement . " Zalasta knew that he must needs have the rings to command the sapphire rose , " she went on , " but all of Styricum knew that the nimble Child-Goddess herself had purloined the rings from Ghwerig the Troll-Dwarf to prevent the misshapen creature from raising Bhelliom ' gainst the Styrics . Thus did Zalasta feign continuing friendship for Sephrenia and her sister , hoping to gain knowledge of the location of the rings and thus the keys to Bhelliom . Now the Gods had known , and some few humans as well , that one day Bhelliom 's creature Anakha would appear , and by diverse signs and auguries did they divine that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wary , for she knew that the house of Sparhawk was Elene , and Elenes are not kindly disposed toward Styricum . She knew , however , that one day Anakha would come , and that he would raise Bhelliom from the place where it had lain hidden and wield it to his own purposes  --  and to the purposes of Bhelliom itself . She was troubled by this , for should Anakha share the common Elene despite of Styrium , might he raise the jewel against her worshippers . She sought to diminish that peril by separating the rings , placing one in the hands Anakha 's ancestor and the other elsewhere , so that when the one ng descended to Anakha , she might examine his heart and mind to determine whether it be safe to place both rings in his possession . " " Stories are more exciting when you know the people involved , re n't they ? " Talen noted , filling his plate for the third time . Talen  | was growing again and he ate almost constantly . He did , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliced fruit and a glass of milk to Xanetia before he sat down to gorge himself . Sparhawk phrased his question carefully . " I seem to remember that you once told me that you ca n't hear the thoughts of the Gods , Anarae . How is it that you know what Aphrael was thinking ? " " It is true that the thoughts of the Gods are veiled from me , Anakha , but Aphrael hath few secrets from her sister , and it is from Sephrenia 's memories that I have gleaned what I have told ye . " Now , " she went on with her account , " Anakha 's ancestor was a Pandion Knight dwelling with his brethren in the motherhouse of his order in the city of Demos in Elenia , and joined he in the war of the rash young king Antor against certain rebellious barons . And it came to pass that the knight and the king , separated from their companions , lay sorely wounded on the bloody field of battle . As darkness fell upon that field , did Sephrenia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bind their wounds and to deliver up the rings ? one to each of them . She did conceal the true import of the rings , advising them that they were but tokens of their friendship , and by means of a Styric spell did she stain the rings with the mingled blood of the wounded pair to conceal their true nature and import . Thus did she bind the two houses together , which binding did prepare the way for the union of Anakha and his queen . " Ehlana beamed smugly at her husband . " I told you so , " she said . " I did n't quite follow that . " " I told you that we were destined to marry . Why did you keep arguing with me ? " " It seemed like the thing to do . I was fairly sure you could have done better . " It was a slightly flippant reply , and it concealed his shocked surprise . Obviously Aphrael was absolutely ruthless in her manipulation of people 's lives . Anakha was Bhelliom 's creature , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had deliberately arranged to be born as his daughter so that she could in some measure control him . " Now Zalasta , perceiving the intent of Aphrael , was troubled , " Xanetia went on . " He had hoped to wrest Bhelliom from Anakha before Anakha could come to know the full import of his union with the stone , but Aphrael had once again blocked his design . By virtue of the rings and the mastery of Bhelliom which they conferred had Anakha been made invincible . "  | " All right , then , " Ulath rumbled . " Zalasta was blocked . What did he do then ? " " There are some in Styricum  --  and have ever been  --  who , like the Elder Gods themselves , have used the power of the spells their race has learned to satisfy unwholesome personal desires . The Younger Gods are as children in this regard , and they can not know the depths to which such as these will willingly sink . They are outraged by this coarser side of the nature of man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These unfortunates dwell alone and sorrowing in wilderness and waste , or , all unrepentant , seek they their vile pleasure in the festering stews of the cities of this world . It was to these that Zalasta in desperation turned , and in Verel , foulest of the cities of southern Daconia , found he such a one as he sought . " " I 've lived in Verel , " Mirtai said . " That would be the place to look for degenerates , all right . " Xanetia nodded . " There in that sink of iniquity Zalasta did happen quite by chance upon one Ogerajin , a corrupt and ancient voluptuary . Now this Ogerajin was double-dipt in vileness , and by means of certain forbidden spells and enchantments had he reached into the darkness  --  yea , even into that ultimate corruption that lieth in the hearts of the Elder Gods . And Ogerajin , perceiving that Zalasta 's lust was like his own and that they were therefore kindred , counseled him to seek out Otha of Zemoch . " Bevier gasped . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zalasta journey even unto the city of Zemoch to make alliance with Otha . " " Hold it , " Kalten said . " Did n't you tell us that Zalasta was trying to keep us away from Otha and Azash ? " She nodded . " Zalasta doth conclude alliances to further his own ends , not those of his allies . With Otha 's aid he found other outcast Styrics in Eosia to aid him in keeping watch on the family of the Sparhawks , instructing them to seek out weaknesses which might be to his advantage when Anakha was born . " As well ye might guess , Aphrael also set a watcher on those who would precede Sparhawk , and despite her sister 's protests , the ChildGoddess sent Sephrenia to Demos to instruct the Elene Pandions in the Secrets of Styricum . " " Our charming little Aphrael has a heartless streak , I see , " Straiten noted . " Considering what the Elene serfs in Astel did to Sephren-  | in 's parents , sending her to Demos smacks of a certain lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a God ? " Xanetia sighed . She passed a weary hand across her eyes . " Are n't you feeling well ? " Kalten asked , his voice mirroring his concern . " Some slight fatigue , Sir Kalten , " she confessed . " The mind of Sephrenia was in great turmoil when I did gather in her memories , and it is with no small difficulty that I wring some consistency from them . " " Is that the way it works , Anarae ? " Sarabian asked curiously . " You just reach in and swallow somebody else 's mind whole ? " " Thy metaphor is inexact , Sarabian of Tamuli , " she said in a slightly reproving tone . " Forgive me , Anarae , " he apologized . " I plucked it out of the air . What I meant to ask was whether you absorb the entire contents of another 's awareness and memories with a single touch . " " Approximately , yes . " " How many minds have you got stored away ? " Talen asked her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Close on to a thousand , young master . " She shrugged . " Where do you find room ? " He paused , looking just a little embarrassed . " I did n't say that very well , did I ? What I was trying to ask was , Does n't it get awfully crowded in there ? " " The mind is limitless , young master . " " Yours might be , Anarae . " Kalten smiled . " I 've found plenty of , limits to mine , though . " " Is Sephrenia all right ? " Vanion asked her with a worried frown . ' " She is in great agony , " Xanetia sighed . " Zalasta 's treachery hath wounded her to the heart , and her mistaken belief that all of ye hav forsaken her hath crushed her spirit . " " I 'll go to her , " Vanion said , rising quickly to his feet . " No , my Lord , " Kalten told him . " That would n't be a good idea . You 're too close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make her feet worse . Why do n't you let me go instead ? " " It 's my place to go , Kalten . " " Not if it 's going to make her suffer all the more , it is n't . Right now she needs to know that we still love her , and that means she needs somebody who 's affectionate and not very bright . That 's me , in case you had n't noticed . "  | " You stop that ! " Alean flared . " I wo n't have you saying things like that about yourself ! " Then she seemed to realize that they were not alone , and she blushed and lowered her eyes in confusion . " He might be right , Vanion , " Ehlana said gravely . " Sir Kalten may have his faults , but he 's straightforward and honest . Sephrenia knows that there 's no deviousness in his nature . He 's just too .. . too ... " " Stupid ? " Kalten supplied . " That 's not the word I 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my Queen . They do n't pay me to think  --  just to follow orders . When I try to think , I get in trouble , so I 've learned to get along without thinking . I just trust my feelings Instead . They do n't lead me off in the wrong direction too often . Sephrenia knows me , and she knows I could n't deceive her even if I tried . " " It 's called sincerity , my friend . " Sparhawk smiled . " That 's as good a word for it as any , I suppose . " Kalten shrugged . " I 'll just nip on down to her room and smother her with sincerity . That ought to make her feel better . " " It 's me , Sephrenia . Kalten . Unlock the door . " " Go away . " Her voice was muffled . " This is important . " " Leave me alone . " Kalten sighed . It was going to be one of those days . " Please , little mother , " he tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't open the door , I 'll have to use magic on it . " " Magic ? You ? " She laughed scornfully . Kalten leaned back , raised his right leg , and drove his booted heel against the latch . He kicked it twice more , and the door splintered nd burst open . " What are you doing ? " she screamed at him . " Have n't you ever seen Elene magic before , little mother ? " he ked her mildly . " We use it all the time . You do n't mind if I come , do you ? " He stepped through the splinter-littered doorway . " We ought you might be lonesome and that maybe you needed somebody yell at . Vanion wanted to come , but I would n't let him . " " You ? Since when have you started ordering Vanion around ? " " I 'm bigger than he is  --  and younger . "  | " You get out of my room ! " " I 'm sorry , but I ca n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got a nice view from here . You can see all the way down to the harbor . Shall we get started ? Screaming and hitting are all right , but please do n't turn me into a toad . Alean would n't like that . " " Who sent you here , Kalten ? " " I already told you . It was my own idea . I would n't let Vanion come because you 're upset right now . You might say something to him that you 'd both regret later . You can say anything you want to me , Sephrenia . You ca n't hurt my feelings . " " Go away ! " " No , I wo n't do that . Would you like to have me make you a nice cup of tea ? " " Just leave me alone ! " " I already told you no . " Then he took her by the shoulders and enfolded her in a huge bear hug . She struggled against him , but he was absolutely immovable . " Your hair smells nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders with her fists . " I hate you ! " " No , you do n't , " he replied calmly . " You could n't hate me even if you wanted to . " He continued to hold her . " It 's been very mild this autumn , has n't it ? " " Please leave me alone , Kalten . " " No . " She started to cry , clutching at his doublet and burying her face in his chest . " I 'm so ashamed ! " she wept . " Of what ? You did n't do anything wrong . Zalasta tricked you , that 's all . He tricked the rest of us as well , so you 're no more to blame than we are . " " I 've broken Vanion 's heart ! " " Oh , I do n't think so  --  not really . You know Vanion . He can endure almost anything . " The storm of her weeping continued  --  which was more or less what Kalten had in mind . He pulled a handkerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , still not relaxing his embrace . " I 'll never be able to face them again , " she wailed . " Who ? You mean the others ? Of course you will . You made a fool of yourself , that 's all . Everybody does that now and then . " How dare you ! " She began to pound on him again . Kalten really wished she 'd get past that part of it . " It 's true , though , is n't it ? " he said gently . " Nobody 's blaming you , but it 's true all the  | tame . You did what you thought was right , but it turned out to be wrong . Everybody 's wrong sometimes , you know . There are n't any perfect people . " " I 'm so ashamed ! " " You already said that . Are you sure you would n't like a nice cup of tea ? " You should rest now , Anarae , " Sarabian said solicitously . " I had n't realized how exhausting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thou art kind , Sarabian of Tamuli , but I am not so fragile as that . Let us proceed . It had been in the mind of Zalasta hat he might by diverse inducements corrupt Anakha in his youth and thus gain access to Bhelliom without the need for perilous confrontation , but Sephrenia and Aphrael did closely attend the childhood and youth of Bhelliom 's champion , once again and all unknowingly thwarting Zalasta 's design . " Then did Zalasta conclude that he had no choice but to approach Anakha as an enemy rather than a convert , and consulted he with Ogerajin and with Otha and went he even to Cimmura to seek allies to assist him . In furtherance of this did he pose as one of the numerous Zemoch Styrics Otha had sent into the Elene kingdoms to sow dissention and turmoil . " " There were plenty of those , all right , " Ulath said . " Rumor had it that a Zemoch Styric could give an Elene anything he wantedrovided that the Elene was n't too attached to his soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Xanetia agreed , " but the understanding of Otha 's agents was limited . " " Profoundly limited , " Vanion agreed . " Truly . Zalasta , however , was more subtle , and far more patient . Ile did find an apt pupil in the person of the young chaplain to the royal house of Elenia , a priest named Annias . " " Annias ? " Ehlana exclaimed . " I did n't know that he was ever the royal chaplain . " " It was before you were born , " Sparhawk told her . " That would explain why he had so much control over my father . Are you saying that Zalasta was behind all that , Anarae ? " Xanetia nodded . " It is n't really all that easy to corrupt a young priest , " Bevier objected . " They 're usually filled with zeal and idealism . " " And Annias was no exception , " Xanetia replied . " He was am-LI  | bitious , but in his youth was he ever true to the ideals of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found means to wear it away . " She paused , flushing slightly . " I would not offend thee , Maj-esty , " she apologized to Ehlana , " but thine aunt was ever lustful and wanton . " " It does n't offend me in the slightest , Anarae , " Ehlana replied . " Arissa 's appetites were legendary in Cimmura , and I was never really all that fond of her in the first place . " " There was some connection , then ? " Melidere asked . " Indeed , Baroness , " Xanetia replied . " Princess Arissa was the means whereby Zalasta recruited Annias to his cause . Well-schooled by the voluptuary Ogerajin , did Zalasta introduce the wanton princess to ? " She broke off , blushing furiously . " You need n't go into detail , Xanetia , " Ehlana told her . " We all knew Arissa ; there was nothing she would n't do . " " In truth was she an apt pupil , " Xanetia agreed . " Now Zalasta concluded that Annias would be useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy father . Thus did he implant the firm belief in the mind of thy corrupt aunt that no act could be so vile as the seduction of a young priest . That notion , once implanted , did obsess Arissa , and ' ere long it bore fruit . In her twelfth year did Arissa steal away the dubious virtue of thy father 's chaplain . " " At the age of twelve ? " Melidere murmured . " She was precocious , was n't she ? " " Then Annias was consumed with remorse , " Xanetia continued . " Annias ? " Ehlana scoffed . " He did n't know what the word meant . " " You may be wrong there , my Queen , " Vanion disagreed . " I knew Annias when he was a young man . He seemed committed to the principles of the Church . It was n't until later that he began to change . Sparhawk 's father and I always wondered what had happened to him . " " Evidently Arissa happened , " Ehlana said dryly . She pursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of my aunt ? " she guessed . Xanetia nodded . " The young priest , after much prayer and meditation , did resolve to renounce his vows and to wed the tarnished princess . " " A marriage made in heaven , " Ulath noted sardonically . " Arissa , however , would have none of such union , for so insatiable  | was her nature that she soon grew tired of her ecclesiastical paramour and did taunt him by reason of his waning prowess and stamina . At Zalasta 's insinuating suggestion , however , did she bring her exhausted convert to a certain house in Cimmura , and there did Zalasta hint that he might restore the waning vigor of Annias by means of Styric enchantments . Thus did he secure a firm grip on the soul of he who would become Primate of Cimmura . " " We knew that Annias was getting help from one of Otha 's Styr-ics , " Sparhawk said . " We had no idea it was Zalasta , though . He had a hand in virtually everything , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anakha . Patiently did he instruct his two ever-more-willing pupils in that depravity which he himself had learned under the tutelage of Ogerajin of Verel . The royal chaplain was central to his plan , but first was it necessary to corrupt him beyond all hope of redemption . " " He did that part of it well enough , " Ehlana said bleakly . " Step by step did Arissa , guided by Zalasta , lead the chaplain down and down until all semblance of decency had been washed from him . Then it was that the Styric proposed the ultimate degeneracy ? that the lustful princess , aided by her now equally foul paramour , should seduce thy father , her brother , and when he should be wholly in her thrall , should she broach the idea of incestuous marriage to him . Zalasta did well know that Anakha 's father would resist such abomination to the death , and hoped he thereby to separate the house of Sparhawk from the royal house of Elenia . Reckoned he not , however , upon the iron will of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sparhawk compelled thy father to wed another , but in truth had Zalasta 's goal been achieved . A breach had been opened between the two houses . " " But we 've healed that breach , have n't we , Sparhawk ? " Ehlana Raid with a warm smile . " Frequently , " he replied . " What can I do ? " Sephrenia wailed , wringing her hands . " You can stop doing that , for one thing , " Kalten told her , gently separating her hands . " I found out a little while ago just how sharp your fingernails are , and I do n't want you tearing off your skin . " She looked guiltily at the fresh scratches on his face . " I hurt you , did n't I , dear one ? "  | " It 's nothing . I 'm used to bleeding . " " I 've treated Vanion so badly , " she mourned . " He 'll never forgive me , and I love him . " " Then tell him so . That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him how you feel about him , say you 're sorry , and everything will go back to being the way it was before . " " It wo n't ever be the same . " " Of course it will . As soon as you two are back together , Vanion will forget it ever happened . " He took her two small hands in his great ones , turned them over , and kissed her palms . " That 's what love 's all about , little mother . We all make mistakes . The people who love us forgive the mistakes . The people who wo n't forgive do n't really matter , now , do they ? " " Well , no , but ? " " There are n't any buts , Sephrenia . It 's so simple that even I can understand it . Alean and I trust our feelings , and it seems to work out fairly well . You do n't really need complicated logic when it comes to something as simple as love . " " You 're such a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hardly , " he replied ruefully . " I drink too much , and I eat too much . I 'm not very refined , and I usually ca n't follow even a simple thought from one end to the other . God knows I 've got faults , but Alean knows about them and forgives them . Sh knows that I 'm just a soldier , so she does n't expect too much fro me . Are you just about ready for that cup of tea ? " " That would be nice . " She smiled . " Now that comes as a real surprise , " Vanion said , " but why Martel ? ' " Zalasta did perceive that of all the Pandions , Martel came close to being a match for Anakha , " Xanetia replied , " and Martel 's hung for the forbidden secrets provided Zalasta with an opening . The Styri did pose as an unlettered and greedy Zemoch , and did accept Martel ' gold with seeming eagerness . Thus did he beguile the arrogant young Pandion until there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time he was posing as Otha 's emissary ? " Bevi asked her . " Yes , Sir Knight . He served Otha 's design so long as it suited him , . but his heart and mind remained his own . Truly , he did corrupt Pd . mate Annias and the Pandion Martel for his own ends , which did evef  | center upon that day when Anakha would lift Bhelliom from the place where it lay hidden . " " But it was n't Anakha who lifted it , Anarae . It was Aphrael , and none of Zalasta 's scheming could have taken that into account . " They all turned quickly at the sound of the familiar voice . Sephrenia , her face still drawn , stood in the doorway with Kalten hovering behind her . " Zalasta might possibly have been able to take the stone from Sparhawk , but not Aphrael . That 's where everything fell apart on him . He could n't bring himself to believe that anyone  --  even a God  --  would willingly surrender Bhelliom to someone else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have seen into the mind of Zalasta , Sephrenia of Ylara , " Xanetia told her . " He could not comprehend such an act . " " I 'll make him understand , Anarae , " Sephrenia replied in a bleak voice . " I have this group of big savage Elenes who love me  --  or so they say . I 'm sure that if I ask them nicely enough , they 'll beat that understanding into Zalasta . " And she smiled a wan little smile . 1  | Ehlana rose from her chair , went to Sephrenia , and kissed her palms in greeting . Sparhawk often marveled at how his young wife instinctively knew the right thing to do . " We 've missed you , little mother , " she said simply . " Are you feeling better now ? " A faint smile touched Sephrenia 's lips . " Exactly how do you define better , Ehlana ? " She looked closely at the blonde queen . " You 're not getting enough sleep . " " You look . a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we both have reason enough . " " Oh , yes . " Sephrenia looked around at the slightly apprehensive faces of her friends . " Oh , stop that , " she told them . " I 'm not going to throw a fit . I behaved badly . " She reached up and fondly touched Kalten 's cheek . " My overbearing friend here tells me that it does n't matter , but I 'd still like to apologize . " " You had plenty of reason to be upset , " Sparhawk told her . " We were very abrupt with you . " " That 's no excuse , dear one . " She drew in a deep breath , squared her shoulders , and crossed the room to Xanetia with the air of one about to perform an unpleasant duty . " We do n't really have any reason to be fond of each other , Anarae , " she said , " but we should at least be civil . I was n't . I 'm sorry . " " Thy courage becomes thee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hard-pressed thus to admit a fault to an enemy . " " Exactly what did Sir Kalten do to bring you around , Lady Se-  | phrenia ? " Sarabian asked curiously . " You were in absolute despair , and Kalten would n't have been my first choice as a comforter . " " That 's because you do n't know him , Sarabian . His heart is very large , and he demonstrates his affection in a very direct way . He kicked my door down and smothered me into submission . " She thought about it for a moment . " About all he really did was wrap his arms around me and tell me that he loved me . He kept saying it over and over again , and every time he said it , it struck me right to the heart . Elenes are very good bullies . I screamed at him for a while , and then I tried hitting him , but hitting Kalten is sort of like pounding on a brick . I even tried crying  --  I 've always had good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make me a cup of tea . " She shrugged . " After a while , I realized that he was going to continue to love me no matter what I did and that I was making a fool of myself , so here I am . " She smiled at Alean . " I do n't know if you realize it , dear , but you may just be the luckiest woman in the world . Do n't let him get away . " " No fear of that , Lady Sephrenia , " the soft-eyed girl responded with a rosy blush . Sephrenia looked around , suddenly all business . " I 'm sure we have more important things to discuss than my recent temper tantrum . Have I missed much ? " " Oh , not really , dear sister , " Stragen drawled . " About all we 've discovered so far is that Zalasta 's been responsible for nearly every catastrophe in human history since the fall of man . We do n't have quite enough evidence to implicate him in that yet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Caalador added . Sparhawk briefly summarized what Xanetia had told them of the hidden side of Zalasta . Sephrenia was startled to learn that it had been Zalasta who had corrupted Martel . " I 'm not trying to be offensive , dear sister , " Stragen said , " but it seems to me that the Younger Gods were n't quite firm enough in dealing with these renegade Styrics . They seem to lend themselves to lust about every bit of mischief that comes along . Something a bit more permanent than banishment might have been a better solution . " " The Younger Gods would n't do that , Stragen . " " Pity , " he murmured . " That sort of leaves it up to us , does n't it ? We 've got a group of people out there who are highly skilled at causing trouble . " His expression grew sly . " Here 's a notion , " he said . " Why  | do n't you have somebody draw up a list of names and give it to me . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the messy details . We would n't even need to bother the Younger Gods or the rest of Styricum about it . You propose , and I 'll dispose . Call it a personal favor if you like . " " You 're a depraved man , Stragen . " " Yes . I thought you might have noticed that . " " What did Zalasta do after Sparhawk destroyed Azash ? " Talen asked Xanetia . " Did n't that teach him that he 'd be wiser to stay clear of our friend here ? " " He was much chagrined , young master . Anakha had demolished decades of patient labor in a single night and , with Bhelliom firmly in his grasp , he was more dangerous than ever . Zalasta 's hopes of wresting the jewel from him were dashed , and he fled from Zemoch in rage and disappointment . " " And when he ran away , he missed seeing Sparhawk throw Bhelliom into the sea , " the boy added . " So far as he knew , Sparhawk still had it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Verel to consult with Ogerajin and diverse other renegades concerning this disastrous turn of events . " " How many of them are there , Lady ? " Kalten asked , " and what are they like ? It 's always good to know your enemies . " " They are many , Sir Kalten , but four  --  in addition to Zalasta and Ogeraj in  --  are most significant . They are the most powerful and corrupt in all of Styricum . Ogerajin is by far the foulest , but his powers are waning by reason of a loathsome disease which doth eat away at his mind . " Xanetia suddenly looked uncomfortable and she even blushed . " It is one of those ailments which do infect those who engage overmuch in bawdry . " " Ah ? " Sarabian came to her aid , " I do n't know that we need to get too specific about Ogerajin 's disease . Why do n't we just say that he 's incapacitated and let it go at that ? Who are the others , Anarae ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most versed in the darker aspects of Styric magic , Emperor Sarabian , " she replied . " Residing close by the eastern frontier of Zemoch , had he frequent contacts with the half-Styric , half-Elene wizards of that accursed land , and did he learn much from them . Reaches he with some facility into the darkness which did surround the mind of Azash , and he can summon certain of the creatures which served the Elder God . " " Damorks ? " Berit asked . " Seekers ? "  | " The Damorkim perished with their master , Sir Knight . The fate of the Seekers is uncertain . Cyzada fears to summon such as they , for only Otha could surely control them . " " That 's something , anyway , " Khalad said . " I 've heard some stories that I 'd rather not have to confirm in person . " " In addition to Cyzada , Zalasta and Ogerajin have allied themselves with Ptaga of Jura , Ynak of Lydros , and Djarian of Samar , " Xanetia continued . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would n't have believed Zalasta could sink so low . " " Bad ? " Kalten asked her . " Worse than that . Ptaga 's a master of illusion who can blur the line between reality and imagining . It 's said that he conjures up the images of various women for the pleasure of the degenerates who pay him , and that the images are even better than reality could be . " " Evidently he 's branching out , " Oscagne noted . " It would appear that he 's creating the illusions of monsters now instead of pretty ladies . That would explain all the vampires and the like . " " Ynak 's reputed to be the most contentious man alive , " Sephrenia went on . " He can start centuries-long feuds between families just by walking past their houses . He 's probably behind the upsurge of racial hatred that 's contaminating the Elene kingdoms to the west . Djarian is probably the preeminent necromancer in the world . It 's said that he can raise people who never even really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , " like those antique Lamorks or the Cyrgai ? " " I doubt it , " she replied , " although I ca n't be sure . It was Zalasta who told us it was impossible , and he may have been lying . " " I 've got a question , Anarae , " Talen said . " Can you see what Zalasta 's thinking as well as hear it ? " " To some degree , young master . " " What are you getting at , Talen ? " Sparhawk asked him . " You remember that spell you used to put Krager 's face in that basin of water back in Platime 's cellar in Cimmura ? " Sparhawk nodded . " A name 's just a name , " Talen noted , " and these particular Styrics probably are n't running around announcing themselves . Stragen suggested getting rid of them earlier . Would n't pictures make that a lot easier ? If Xanetia can see Zalasta 's memories of what those people look like and let me see them , too , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send the pictures to Verel  --  or wherever those Styrics are  --  and Zalasta would suddenly lose some people he 's been counting on rather heavily . I think we owe him that much , anyway . " " I like the way this boy thinks , Sparhawk . " Ulath grinned . " Thy plan is flawed , young master , " Xanetia said to Talen . " The spell of which thou didst speak is a Styric spell , and I have no familiarity with it . " " Sephrenia could teach it to you . " He shrugged . " You 're asking the impossible , Talen , " Bevier told him . " Sephrenia and Xanetia have only recently reached the point where they can be in the same room without wanting to kill each other . There 's a lot of trust involved in teaching  --  and learning  --  spells . " Xanetia and Sephrenia , however , had been exchanging a long , troubled look . " Do n't be too quick to throw away a good idea , Bev-ier , " Sephrenia murmured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she suggested tentatively . " The notion probably makes your skin crawl as much as it does mine , but if we could ever learn to trust each other , there could be all manner of things we might be able to accomplish . If we could combine your magic with mine . . . " She left it hanging . Xanetia pursed her lips , and her expression oddly mirrored Se-phrenia 's . So intense was her consideration of the notion that her control slipped a bit , and her face began to glow . " The alliance between our two races did almost bring the Cyrgai to their knees , " she noted , also rather tentatively . " In diplomatic circles this is the point at which the negotiators usually adjourn so that they can consult with their governments , " Oscagne suggested . " The Anarae and I are n't obliged to get instructions from either Sarsos or Delphaeus , your Excellency , " Sephrenia told him . " Most diplomats are n't , either . " He shrugged . " The announcement ' I must consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying ' Your suggestion is interesting . Give me some time to think it over and get used to the idea . ' You ladies are breaking new ground . I 'd advise you not to rush things . " " What say you , Sephrenia of Ylara ? " Xanetia said , smiling shyly , " shall we pause for a fictional consultation with Sarsos and Del-phaeus ? " " That might not be such a bad idea , Xanetia of Delphaeus , " Sephrenia agreed .

" The spell of which thou didst speak is a Styric spell , and I have no familiarity with it . " " Sephrenia could teach it to you . " He shrugged . " You 're asking the impossible , Talen , " Bevier told him . " Sephrenia and Xanetia have only recently reached the point where they can be in the same room without wanting to kill each other . There 's a lot of trust involved in teaching  --  and learning  --  spells . " Xanetia and Sephrenia , however , had been exchanging a long , troubled look . " Do n't be too quick to throw away a good idea , Bev-ier , " Sephrenia murmured . " It has got some possibilities , Anarae , " she suggested tentatively . " The notion probably makes your skin crawl as much as it does mine , but if we could ever learn to trust each other , there could be all manner of things we might be able to accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " She left it hanging . Xanetia pursed her lips , and her expression oddly mirrored Se-phrenia 's . So intense was her consideration of the notion that her control slipped a bit , and her face began to glow . " The alliance between our two races did almost bring the Cyrgai to their knees , " she noted , also rather tentatively . " In diplomatic circles this is the point at which the negotiators usually adjourn so that they can consult with their governments , " Oscagne suggested . " The Anarae and I are n't obliged to get instructions from either Sarsos or Delphaeus , your Excellency , " Sephrenia told him . " Most diplomats are n't , either . " He shrugged .

I did n't want to wake you . I may have met this Ynak you 've been talking about , Anarae . One of the men who approached me was Styric , and I 've never met a more disagreeable individual . I 've come across goats who smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes looked off in different directions , and his teeth were broken and rotting , and they all seemed to stick straight out . He looked like a man with a mouthful of brown icicles . " " Thy description doth closely match Zalasta 's memories of him . " " That one should n't be too orful hord t ' find , Stragen , " Caalador drawled . " I kin send word t ' Verel , iffn y ' want . This yere Why-nack ai n't likely t ' be missed much if'n he 's as on-pleasant as the furrin minister sea . " Xanetia looked puzzled . " It 's a pose that amuses my colleague , Anarae , " Stragen apologized . " He likes to put on the airs of a yokel . He says it 's for the purposes of concealment , but I think he does it just to irritate me . " " Thine Elenes are droll and frolicsome , Sephrenia of Ylara , ' Xanetia said .  | " I know , Anarae , " Sephrenia sighed . " It 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stragen protested mildly . " How did you put this fellow off without getting a knife in your back , your Excellency ? " Talen asked Oscagne . " Declining that sort of offer is usually fatal . " " I told him that the price was n't right , " Oscagne shrugged . " I said that if he could come up with a better offer , I might be inter-ested . " " Very good , your Excellency , " Caalador said admiringly . " What kind of reason did he give you for making the offer in the first place ? " " He was a bit vague about it . He hinted about some kind of largescale smuggling operation and said that he could use the help of the foreign service to smooth the way in various kingdoms outside Tamuli . He hinted that he 'd already bought off the Interior Ministry and the customs branch of the Chancellory of the Exchequer . " " He was lying , your Excellency , " Stragen told him . " There is n't that much money to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short pay . " " I rather thought so myself . " Oscagne leaned back , stroking his chin thoughtfully . " This group of Styrics down in Verel may think they 're very worldly , but they 're like children when compared to real criminals and international businessmen . They cooked up a story that was n't really very convincing . What they actually wanted was access to the government and the power of the various ministries in order to use that power to overthrow the government itself . The government had to be on the brink of collapse in order to get me to run off to Eosia to beg Prince Sparhawk to come here and save us . " " It worked , did n't it ? " Itagne said bluntly . " Well , yes , I suppose it did , but it was so clumsy . I 'd personally be ashamed to accept such a shoddy victory . It 's a matter of style , Itagne . Any amateur can blunder into occasional triumph . The true professional controls things well enough not to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long after that . Sparhawk watched Sephrenia and Vanion rather closely as everyone filed out . The two of them exchanged a few tentative glances , but neither seemed ready to break the ice . They gathered again the following morning , and Talen and Kalten  | seemed to be competing to see which of them could eat the most for breakfast . After a bit of casual conversation , they got down to business again . " Right after the attempted coup here in Matherion , Krager paid me a visit , " Sparhawk told Xanetia . " Was he telling the truth when he said that Cyrgon 's involved in this ? " She nodded . " Cyrgon hath much reason to hate the Styrics and their Gods , " she replied . " The curse which hath imprisoned his Cyrgai for ten eons hath enraged him beyond all measure . The outcast Styrics in Verel did share his hatred , for they , too , had been punished . " She reflected a moment . " We all have reason to hate Zalasta , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was at peril of his life that he did carry the proposal of the renegades to the Hidden City of Cyrga to place it before Cyrgon himself . The proposal was simple . By means of Bhelliom could the curse be lifted and the Cyrgai loosed once more upon this world . The Styrics could be crushed , which would please both Cyrgon and the outcasts ; the Cyrgai would come to dominate the world  --  with positions of honor and power reserved for Ogerajin and his friends ; and Aphrael would be destroyed , thus giving possession of Sephrenia to Zalasta . " " Something for everybody , " Sarabian said dryly . " So thought Ogerajin and Zalasta , " Xanetia agreed . " They had , however , reckoned not upon the nature of Cyrgon . They soon found that he would in no wise consent to the secondary role they had in mind for him . Cyrgon doth command ; he doth not follow . He did set his high priest , one Ekatas , over his new allies , telling them that Ekatas spoke for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the God 's simplicity , thinking that the High Priest Ekatas would , like all the Cyrgai , die with the step which took him over the unseen line in the sand . Ekatas , however , had no need of crossing the line . With Cyr-gon 's aid did he travel with his mind , not his body , that he might observe and direct without leaving Cyrga . Truly , the mind of Ekatas can reach across vast distances , not only to convey the will of Cyrgon , but to advise the diverse cohorts of what hath occurred elsewhere . " " That explains how the word that we were coming got from one end of Cynesga to the other so fast , " Bevier said . " We sort of won ? dered how they were keeping ahead of us . " " Now , " Xanetia pressed on , " though they are outcast and despised , Ogerajin and the others are still Styrics , and the Styrics are not a warlike people . Their efforts had concentrated on deception and mis-  | direction previously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did command them to raise armies to confront the Atans , who are the strong arts of the empire . Then were the outcasts of Verel nonplussed , for Cyrgon gave the command , but no guidance . Zalasta , who had traveled much in Eosia , did suggest to Ekatas that Cyrgon might deceive the Trolls and bring them to northern Tamuli , and Cyrgon did readily consent . Still he demanded more . Ynak of Lydros , who doth ever carry that cloud of dissention with him , could fan the fires of discontent in III of Tamuli , but so contentious is his nature that none would willingly follow him . Armies require generals , and Styrics are not gifted in that profession . I do not say this to give offense , Sephrenia , " she added quickly . Both Xanetia and Sephrenia were being very careful with each other . " I 'm not offended , Xanetia . I like soldiers , mind you . " Her eyes flickered toward Vanion . " Some of them , anyway . But I really think the world might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tongue , " Ulath told her . " If we could n't be soldiers , we 'd all have to go out and find honest work . " Xanetia smiled . " It was in desperation  --  for Cyrgon did grow im-patient  --  that Zalasta did journey to Arjuna to enlist his son Scarpa in the enterprise . Now Scarpa was unlike his father in that he did will-ingly  --  even eagerly  --  resort to violence . His years as a performer in shabby carnivals had taught him the skills of swaying crowds of people by eloquence and by his commanding presence . His profession , however , was held in low regard , and this did pain him deeply , for Scarpa bah an exalted opinion of himself . " " He does indeed , little Lady , " Caalador agreed . " If what the hieves of Arjuna tell me is anywhere close to being accurate , Scarpa robably believes that he could fly or walk on water if he just set his ind to it . " " Truly , " she agreed . " He hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profound hatred of women . " " That 's not uncommon among bastards , " Stragen said clinically . Some of us blame our mothers  --  or our Gods  --  for our social unacceptability . Fortunately , I never fell into that trap . But then , I 'm so witty and charming that I did n't have the usual inadequacies to try to ' ) lain away . " " I hate it when he does that , " Baroness Melidere said . " It 's only a plain fact , my dear Baroness . " He grinned at her . ' " false modesty is so unbecoming , do n't you think ? "  | " Be clever on your own time , Stragen , " Ehlana chided . " Did Zalasta tell his son all the details of this conspiracy , Anarae ? " " Yes , your Majesty . Given the nature of the two , there was surprising candor between them . Scarpa , however , was very young and had an exaggerated notion of his own cleverness . Zalasta did quickly realize that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his infrequent visits to Arjuna might serve to deceive rural bumpkins , but they would scarce be adequate for the business at hand . Therefore , took he his son to Verel to place him under the tutelage of Ogerajin . " " When was this , Anarae ? " Caalador asked curiously . " Perhaps five years since , Master Caalador . " " Then it fits together with what we found out . It was almost exactly five years ago that Scarpa disappeared from Arjuna . Then a couple of years later he came back and started stirring up trouble . " " It was a short education , " Xanetia said , " but Scarpa hath a quick mind . In truth , it was his tutor who did suspend his training , for Ogerajin was much offended by the young man 's arrogance . " " This Scarpa sounds like the sort you have to stand in line to hate , " Talen noted . " I 've never met him , and I already dislike him . " " Zalasta was also taken somewhat aback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " and thinking to awe him into some mea sure of civility , he did take him to Cyrga that he might come to kno their master . Cyrgon did question the young man closely and then , evidently satisfied , did he instruct him in the task before him . Scarp came away with no more respect for the God of the Cyrgai than he had felt ' ere they met , and Zalasta hath lost what small regard h previously had for his son . It is now in his mind that should thei conspiracy succeed , Scarpa will not long survive the victory . " Sh paused . " An it please thee to view it so , Sephrenia , thy vengeanc hath already had its beginning . Zalasta is a hollow man with no G and with none in all the world to love him or to call him friend . Eve the scant affection he had for his son is now withered , and he is empt and alone . " Two great tears welled up in Sephrenia 's eyes , but then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's not enough , An arae , " she said adamantly . " You 've spent too much time with Elenes , little mother , " Sara bian said . That startled Sparhawk just a bit . He could not be sure i  | the brilliant , erratic Tamul emperor used that affectionate term deliberately , or if it had been a slip of the tongue . " Who recruited the others , Anarae ? " Vanion asked , smoothly moving away from a slightly touchy situation . " It was Scarpa , Lord Vanion , " she replied . " Cyrgon had directed him to seek out confederates to stir rebellion in western Tamuli , thus to bar the way should Anakha come with the armies of the Church , for Cyrgon would not willingly pit his cherished Cyrgai against such as you . Now Scarpa did know a certain out-at-the-elbows Dacite nobleman who , plagued by gambling debts and the ungentle urgings of his creditors to settle accounts , did flee from Daconia and conceal himself for a time in the very Arjuni carnival where Scarpa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baron Parok by name , did Scarpa seek out on his return home from Cyrga . Parok , desperate out of all measure , soon willingly fell in with his former associate , for the inducements Scarpa offered were enticing . Consulted then the unscrupulous pair with the debauched Styrics at Verel and followed their counsel to seek out the merchant Amador in Edom and the poet Elron in Astel , both men being much taken with themselves and resentful of the station in life which fate had assigned them . " Bevier was frowning . " We 've encountered both of them , Anarae , and neither one strikes me as a natural leader . Were they the best Scarpa could find ? " " Their selection was determined by their willingness to cooperate , Sir Knight . The ability to sway men with words and that commanding presence which doth draw all eyes can be elevated by certain Styric spells . Unimpressive though they are , it was the quality of desperation In them which Scarpa did seek . Both Amador and Elron suffered agonies by reason of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to any lengths to exalt themselves . " " We see it all the time in Thalesia , Bevier , " Ulath explained . " We call it ' the little man 's complaint . ' Avin Wargunsson 's a perfect example . He 'd rather die than be ignored . " " Amador 's not all that short , " Talen pointed out . " There are all kinds of littleness , Talen , " Ulath said . " How did Count Gerrich in Lamorkand get involved , Anarae ? And why ? " " He was recruited by Scarpa on Zalasta 's instruction , Sir Ulath. 7 ; ilasta thought to stir discord and turmoil on the Eosian continent to persuade the Church of Chyrellos that her interests required that An-  | akha be dispatched to Tamuli to seek out the roots of the disturbances . Of all of them , only Zalasta hath his feet planted on both continents , and only he doth understand the thinking of thy Church . In truth , Elron and Amador are but pawns , knowing little of the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more knowledgeable , but he is still not privy to all their designs . Count Gerrich is peripheral . He follows his own purposes , which only occasionally match the purposes of his colleagues here in Tamuli . " " You almost have to admire them , " Caalador said . " This is the most complicated and well-organized swindle I 've ever heard of . " " But it all fell apart when Xanetia opened the door to Zalasta 's mind , " Kalten said . " As soon as we found out that he 's been on the other side all along , the whole thing began to crumble . " He thought of something . " How did Krager get mixed up in this ? " " Count Gerrich did suggest him to Scarpa , " Xanetia replied . " Gerrich had found the one called Krager useful in times past . " " Yes , " Ulath said . " We saw him being useful outside the walls of Baron Alstrom 's castle in Lamorkand . Martel 's still coming back to haunt us , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Minister of the Interior and the other traitors really know about all of this , Anarae ? " Sarabian asked . " Almost nothing , Majesty . In the main they did believe that their activities were but a part of the ongoing struggle between Foreign Minister Oscagne and Interior Minister Kolata . Kolata offered them profit , and so they did follow him . " " Ordinary palace politics , then , " Sarabian mused . " I suppose I 'll have to keep that in mind at their trials . They were n't really disloyal , only corrupt . " " All except for Kolata , your Majesty , " Itagne noted . " His involvement had to have gone deeper than simple garden-variety political bickering , would n't it ? " " Kolata was a dupe , Itagne of Matherion , " Xanetia corrected . " I was Teovin who was ever Zalasta 's man at court . It was to him tha the one called Krager did bring Zalasta 's instruction , and Teovin di tell Kolata only so much as it was needful for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coup attempt , " Ehlana said . " Krager tol Sparhawk that it was n't intended to succeed  --  that it was only designe to force us to reveal our strengths and weaknesses . Was he actuall telling the truth ? " " In part , Majesty , " Xanetia replied . " In the main , however , w  | Zalasta uncertain about the truth of Anakha 's declaration that he had cast Bhelliom into the sea . Sought he by raising rebellion in the streets of Matherion and endangering all whom Anakha held most dear to force him to reveal whether or no he still did possess the jewel . " " We played right into his hands by going after it , then , did n't we ? " Khalad suggested . " I do n't think so , " Sparhawk disagreed . " We 'd never have found out about Bhelliom 's awareness if we 'd left it where it was . That 's the thing that nobody knew about  --  except possibly Aphrael . Azash did n't seem to know about it , and neither does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so interested in it if they 'd known that it might resist their commands  --  even to the point of obliterating this world if necessary . " " All right , " Khalad said . " Now we know what 's led up to all this . What happens next ? " " That lieth in the future , Khalad of Demos , " Xanetia replied , " and the future is concealed from all . Know , however , that our enemies are in disarray . Zalasta 's position as adviser to the imperial government was at the core of all their plans . " " How quickly will he be able to recover , Sephrenia ? " Ehlana asked . " You know him better than anyone . Will he be able to strike hack immediately ? " " Possibly , " Sephrenia said , " but whatever he does wo n't be very well thought out . Zalasta 's a Styric , and we do n't react well to surprises . He 'll flounder for a while  --  destroying mountains and setting lakes on fire  --  before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him again , then , " Bevier observed . " We should n't allow him to recover his balance . " " Here 's a thought , " Sarabian said . " After we went through the cret files of the Interior Ministry , we decided to pick up only the top vel of conspirators  --  the police chiefs and administrators in the various towns , for the most part . We did n't bother with the toadies and informers  --  largely because we did n't have enough jail space . The Interior Ministry was central to the whole conspiracy , I think , and now Zalasta and his friends will probably be forced to rely on the scrapings we left behind . If I send the Atans out to make a more thorough sweep , wo n't that push Zalasta off-balance all the more ? " " Let him start to settle down first , Sarabian , " Sephrenia advised . " Right now he 's so enraged that he probably would n't even notice . " " Is Norkan still on the Isle of Tega ? " Vanion asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I got tired of the forged letters he was sending me from there , so we sent him back to Atan . " " Good . I think we 'd better get word of Zalasta 's treachery to him as quickly as possible . Betuana really needs to know about it . " " I 'll see to it , Vanion-Preceptor , " Engessa promised . " Thank you , Engessa-Atan . If that little outburst in the throne room is any indication of his present state of mind , Zalasta 's totally out of control right now . " " Infuriated to the brink of insanity , " Sephrenia agreed . It was the first time she had spoken directly to Vanion since the rupture between them . That fact gave Sparhawk some hope . " He 'll almost have to do something , then , wo n't he ? " Vanion asked her . " In his present state , inaction would be unbearable . " She nodded . " He 'll respond in some way , " she said , " and since he was n't at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have been planned out in advance . " " So it 'll have large holes in it , wo n't it ? " " Probably . " " Most likely it would involve the use of main force , " Sparhawk added . " Enraged people usually try to smash things . " " You 'd better alert Norkan and Betuana to the possibility , Engessa ? Atan , " Sarabian instructed . " It shall be as you say , Sarabian-Emperor . " Vanion began to pace up and down . " Zalasta 's still more or less in command , " he said . " At least he will be until he does somethin so stupid that Cyrgon replaces him . Why do n't we let him have hi temper tantrum , crush it , and then round up all the minor conspirators ? Let 's frighten our opponents just a bit . If they see us methodically smashing everything they 've gone to so much trouble to prepare and rounding up all their friends , they 'll start having thoughts about their own mortality . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show himself , and then Sparhawk can turn Bhelliom loose on him . " " I hate it when he 's like this , " Sephrenia said to Xanetia . " He 's so certain  --  and probably so right . Men are much more appealing when they 're just helpless little boys . " The casual-seeming remark was star . Cling . Sephrenia was clearly stepping over ancient racial antagonism ) between Styric and Delphae and speaking to Xanetia as one woman to another . " Then all we really have to do is sit here and wait for Zalasta 's next move , " Sarabian observed . " I wonder what he 's going to do . "  | They did not have to wait long for the answer . A few days later on an exhausted Atan stumbled across the drawbridge with an urgent message from Ambassador Norkan . " Oscagne , " the message began with characteristic abruptness , " round up ever Atan you can lay your hands on and send them all here . The Trolls are dismantling northern Atan right down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Engessa-Atan , " Sarabian said . " We need them right where they are . At the moment , they 're all that 's holding the empire to-gether . " Engessa nodded . " I understand the situation , Sarabian-Emperor , but Betuana-Queen will only wait for so long . If the lands of the Atans are in peril , she will have no choice but to act . She will order the Atans home  --  despite her alliance with you . " " She 's going to have to pull her people back , " Vanion advised the huge Atan . " She does n't have enough warriors to defend the north against the Trolls , so she may have to abandon northern Atan for a , while . We wo n't be able to send full garrisons to her aid , but we can pull one or two platoons out of each garrison . That 's several thousand warriors altogether , but it 's going to take them longer to reach Atan because they 're so spread out . She 'll just have to pull back until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanion-Preceptor . We do not run away . " " I 'm not suggesting that , Engessa-Atan . All your queen will be doing is repositioning her forces . She ca n't hold the north at the moment , and there 's no point in wasting lives trying . The best we can do for her in the meantime is to send some Genidian advisers and Cyrinic technical assistance . " " Not quite , friend Vanion , " Kring said . " I 'll go to Tikume in central Astel . The eastern Peloi are n't as fearful of forests as my children are , and Tikume loves a good fight as much as I do , so  | he 'll probably bring several thousand horsemen with him . I 'll gather up a few hundred bowmen and come to Atan ahead of his main force . " " Your offer is generous , friend Kring , " Engessa said . " It 's a duty , Engessa-Atan . You serve as Mirtai 's father , and that makes us kinsmen . " Kring absently rubbed his hand across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think . Your Atans have moral reservations about using bows in warfare , but when we met those Trolls in eastern Astel , we found out that you ca n't really fight them without shooting them full of arrows first . " " Here 's another thought , " Khalad said , holding up his crossbow . " How do your people feel about these , Engessa-Atan ? " Engessa spread his hands . " It is a new device here in Tamuli , Khalad-squire . We have not yet formed an opinion about it . Some Atans may accept it ; others may not . " " We would n't have to arm all the Atans with crossbows , " Khalad said . He looked at Sparhawk . " Will you be needing me here , my Lord ? " he asked . " Why do n't you see if you can persuade me that I wo n't ? " " That 's a cumbersome way to put it , Sparhawk . We 've still got all those crossbows we gathered up when we put down the coup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take me too long to fix them again . I 'll go north with Engessa-Atan and the technical advisers . Engessa can try to persuade his people that the crossbow 's a legitimate weapon of war , and I 'll teach them how to use it . " " I 'll join you in Atana later , " Kring told them . " I 'll have to lead Tikume 's bowmen to the city . The Peloi tend to get lost in forests . " " Never mind , Mirtai , " Ehlana told the giantess , whose eyes had suddenly come alight . " I need you here . " " My betrothed and my father are going to war , Ehlana , " Mirtai objected . " You ca n't expect me to stay behind . " " Oh , yes , I can . You ca n't go , and that 's final . " " May I be excused ? " Mirtai asked stiffly . " If you wish . " Mirtai stormed toward the door . " Do n't break all the furniture , " Ehlana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic crisis , but it was a crisis all the same , largely because the Royal Princess Danae declared that she would die if her missing cat was not found immediately . She wandered tear-  | fully around the throne room , climbing into laps , pleading and cajoling . Sparhawk was once again able to observe the devastating effect his daughter could have on someone 's better judgment when she was sitting in the person 's lap . " Please help me find my cat , Sarabian , " she said , touching the emperor 's cheek with one small hand . Sparhawk had long since learned that the first rule in dealings with Danae was never to let her touch you . Once she touched you , you were lost . " We all need some fresh air anyway , do n't we ? " Sarabian said to the others . " We 've been sitting in this room for more than a week now . Why do n't we suspend our discussions and go find Princess Dan ? ae 's cat . I think we 'll all be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danae . Sparhawk smiled . " I 'll tell you what , " Sarabian continued . " It 's a beautiful morning Why do n't we make an outing of it ? I 'll send word to the kitchens , an we can all have our lunches out on the lawns . " He smiled down at Danae whose hand might just as well have been wrapped around his heart . " We ' celebrate the return of Mmrr to her little mistress . " " What a wonderful idea ! " Danae exclaimed , clapping her han together . " You 're so wise , Sarabian ! " They all smiled indulgently and rose to their feet . Sparhawk pri vately admitted that the emperor was probably right . The long day ' conferences were beginning to make them all just a little fuzzy-headed He went to his daughter and picked her up . " I can walk , Father , " she protested . " Yes , but I can walk faster . My legs are longer . We do want t find Mmrr as soon as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've got everybody under control , " he murmured to her . " Y do n't have to herd them around like sheep . What 's this all about ? You c call Mmrr back home anytime you feel like it . What are you really up to ? " There are some things I want to get settled before we get t ( busy , Sparhawk , and I ca n't do anything with all of you huddled t gether in this room like a flock of chickens . I need to get you all ou of here so that I can straighten things out . " " Is Mmrr really lost ? " " Well , of course she is n't . I know exactly where she is . I just to her to go chase grasshoppers for a while . " " What sort of things were you talking about ? Exactly what is that you want to get straightened out ? " " Watch , Sparhawk , " she told him . " Watch and learn . "  | ' It 's just not done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice the two walked out across the drawbridge with Sparhawk and Danae -t far behind . " What do you mean , ' not done ' ? " " You 're a knight , and I 'm only a peasant girl . Why ca n't we just ave things the way they are ? " " Because I want to marry you . " She touched his face fondly . " And I 'd give anything to be able to rry you , but we ca n't . " " I 'd like to know why not . " " I told you already . We come from different social classes . A peas- " girl ca n't marry a knight . People would laugh at us and say hateful things about me . " " Only once , " he declared , clenching his fist . " You ca n't fight the whole world , my love . " She sighed . " Of course I can  --  particularly if the world we 're talking about nsists of those butterflies that infest the court at Cimmura . I could II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

We 'd never have any friends . at 's all right for you , because you 'll be off at whatever war Prince arhawk or Lord Vanion sends you to , but I 'll be completely me . I could n't bear that . " " I want to marry you ! " he almost shouted . " It would make my life complete as well , my dear love , " she sighed , ut it 's impossible . " " I want you to fix that , Sparhawk , " Danae said out loud . " Quiet ! They 'll hear us . " " They ca n't hear us , Sparhawk  --  or see us , either , for that matter . " " You 're using a spell , I gather ? " " Naturally . It 's a useful little spell that makes people ignore us. ey kind of know we 're here , but their minds do n't pay any attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral objection to eavesdropping , ' , does n't it ? " " What on earth are you talking about , Sparhawk ? I do n't have y moral problems with eavesdropping . I always eavesdrop . How else I supposed to keep track of what people are doing ? Tell Mother to  | give Alean a title so that she and Kalten can get married . I 'd do it myself , but I 'm busy . Take care of it . " " Is this the sort of thing you were talking about earlier ? " " Of course . Do n't waste time on all these silly questions , Sparhawk . We 've got a lot more to do today . " " I do love you , Berit-Knight , " Empress Elysoun said a little sadly , " but I love him , too . " " And how many others do you love , Elysoun ? " Berit asked her acidly . " I 've lost count . " The bare-breasted empress shrugged . " Sarabian does n't mind . Why should you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me any more ? " " Do n't be ridiculous , Berit-Knight . Of course I want to see yo again  --  as often as I possibly can . It 's just that there are going to b times when I 'll be busy seeing him . I did n't have to tell you this , yo know , but you 're so nice that I did n't want to go behind your bac to . . . " She groped for a word . " To be unfaithful ? " he said bluntly . " I 'm never unfaithful , " she said indignantly . " You take that bac right now . I 'm the most faithful lady in the whole court . I 'm faithfu to at least a dozen young men , all at the same time . " He suddenly burst out laughing . " What 's so funny ? " she demanded . " Nothing , Elysoun , " he replied with a genuine fondness . " You ' so delightful that I ca n't help laughing . " She sighed . " Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't take these things so seriously . Love 's supposed to be fun , bu you all scowl and wave your arms in the air about it . Go love somebod else for a while . I wo n't mind . As long as everybody 's happy , what difference does it make who made them happy ? " He smiled again . " You do still love me , do n't you , Berit-Knight ? " " Of course I do , Elysoun . " " There . Everything 's all right , then , is n't it ? " " What was that all about ? " Sparhawk asked his daughter . The were standing fairly close to Berit and Elysoun  --  close enough to ma Sparhawk slightly self-conscious , at any rate . " Berit was getting just a little too deeply involved with the nak girl , " Danae replied . " He 's learned what she could teach him , so it '  | time for their friendship to calm down a little . I have other plans for him " Have you ever considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be ridiculous , Sparhawk . He 'd just make a mess of things . I always take care of these arrangements . It 's one of the things I do best . We 'd better hurry . I want to look in on Kring and Mirtai . He 's going to tell her something that is n't going to make her happy . I want to he there to head off any explosions . " They found Kring and Mirtai sitting on the lawn under a large tree laze with autumn color . Mirtai had opened the basket the kitchen had provided and was looking inside . " Some kind of dead bird , " she ported . Kring made a face . " I suppose it 's civilized food , " he said , trying put the best face on it . " We 're both warriors , my betrothed , " she replied , also looking ss than happy with what had been prepared for their lunch . " We 're pposed to eat red meat . " " Stragen told me once that you ate a wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering the story . " Yes , " she replied simply . " Do you mean you actually did ? " He seemed stunned . " I thought was just trying to fool me . " " I was hungry ? " she shrugged . " ? and I did n't have time to stop . e wolf did n't taste very good , but he was raw . If I 'd had time to , k him , he might have been better . " " You 're a strange woman , my beloved . " " That 's why you love me , is n't it ? " " Well  --  it 's one of the reasons . Are you sure we ca n't talk about r problem ? " He was obviously coming back to a subject they had ussed before  --  many times . " There 's nothing to talk about . We have to be married twice -- once in Atana and then again when we get back to Pelosia . We wo n't really married until we 've gone through both ceremonies . " " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we ? " " Half-married is n't good enough , Kring . I 'm a virgin . I 've killed many men protecting that to settle for half-married . ' You 'll just have to wait . " He sighed . " It 's going to take a long time , you know , " he said mournfully .  | " It 's not that far from Atana back to your country . I 'll race you there . " " It 's not the journey that 's going to take so long , Mirtai . It 's the two months you 'll have to spend in my mother 's tent before the wedding in Pelosia . You 'll have to learn our practices and ceremonies . " She gave him a long , steady look . " You said I have to what ? " There was an ominous tone in her voice . " It 's the custom . A Peloi bride always lives for two months with the groom 's mother before the ceremony . " " Why ? " ? " To learn about him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , yes , I suppose you do , but it 's the custom . " " That 's ridiculous ! " " Customs often are , but I am Domi , so I have to set a good ex-ample  --  and you 'll be Doma . The Peloi women will have no respect for you if you do n't do what 's expected . " " I 'll teach them respect . " Her eyes had turned flint-hard . He leaned back on his elbows . " I was sort of afraid you might feel this way . " He sighed . " Is that why you did n't mention it before ? " " I was waiting for the right time . Is there any wine in that basket ? This might be easier if we 're both more relaxed . " " Let 's wait . We can get relaxed after you tell me . What is this nonsense ? " " Let 's see if I can explain it . " He rubbed his head . " When my people say that the bride is learning about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's learning about what he expects for breakfast or things like that . What they 're really talking about is the fact that there 's property involved . " " I do n't have any property , Kring . I 'm a slave . " " Not after you marry me , you wo n't be . You 'll be a very wealthy woman . " What are you talking about ? " " Peloi men own their weapons and their horses . Everything else belongs to the women . Always before whenever I stole something ? cattle , usually  --  I gave it to my mother . She 's been holding my wealth for me until I get married . She 's entitled to some of it . That 's what the two months is all about . It 's to give the two of you time to agree on the division . "  | " It should n't take us that long . " " Well , probably not . My mother 's a reasonable woman , but the two of you will also have to find husbands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there were n't so many of them . " " How many ? " Her voice was very hard now . " Ah  --  eight , actually . " " Eight ? " She said it flatly . " My father was very vigorous . " " So was your mother , apparently . Are your sisters presentable ? " " More or less . None of them are as beautiful as you are , though , love  --  but then who could be ? " " We can talk about that later . There 's some kind of problem with your sisters , is n't there ? " Kring winced . " How did you know that ? " " I know you , Kring . You saved mention of these sisters until the very last . That means that you did n't want to talk about them , and that means there 's a problem . What is it ? " " They think they 're rich . That makes them put on airs . " " Is that all ? " " They 're very arrogant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She shrugged . " Since there are only eight , I should be able to do it all at once . I 'll just take them all out into the nearest pasture for an hour or so . They 'll be very humble when we come back  --  and eager to marry any men your mother and I choose for them . I 'll make sure they 're willing to do anything to get away from me . Your mother and I should be able to settle the property division in the morning ; I 'll civilize your sisters in the afternoon , and you and I can be married that same evening . " " It 's not done that way , my love . " " It will be , this time . I 'm no more enthusiastic about waiting than you are . Why do n't you come over here and kiss me ? Now that every-thing 's been settled , we should take advantage of this opportunity . " He grinned at her . " My feelings exactly , love . " He took her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genteel at first , but that did n't last for very long . Things turned slightly savage after a moment . " That 's going to work out just fine , " Danae said smugly . " I was n't sure how Mirtai was going to take the idea of living with Kring 's mother , but she 's got everything in hand now . " " She 's going to upset the Peloi , you know , " Sparhawk said . " They 'll live . " The princess shrugged . " They 're too set in their  |  ways anyhow . They need somebody like Mirtai to open their eyes to the modem world . Let 's move on , Sparhawk . We 're not done yet . " " How long has this been going on ? " Stragen asked in a slightly choked voice . " Since I was a little girl , " Melidere replied . " My father made the dies when I was about seven or so . " " Do you realize what you 've done , Baroness ? " " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She smiled at him . He ignored that . " You 've struck a direct blow at the economy of every kingdom in Eosia . This is monstrous ! " " Oh , do be serious , Stragen . " " You 've debased the coinage ! " " I have n't really , but why should it make any difference to you ? " " Because I 'm a thief ! You 've devalued everything I 've ever sto-len ! " " No , not really . The value of the coins does n't really have anything to do with their true weight . It 's a matter of trust . People may not like their governments , but they trust them . If the government says that this coin is worth a half crown , then that 's what it 's worth . Its value is based on an agreement , not on weight . If the coin has milled edges , it has the value that 's stamped on its face . I have n't really stolen anything . " " You 're a criminal , Melidere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't stolen anything ? " " What if they find out about what you 've been doing ? " " What if they do ? They ca n't do anything about it . If they say anything or try to do something to me , I 'll just tell the whole story , and every government in Eosia will collapse because nobody will trust their coins anymore . " She touched his cheek . " You 're such an innocent , Stragen . I think that 's why I 'm fond of you . You pretend to be depraved , but actually you 're like a little boy . " " Why did you tell me about this ? " " Because I need a partner . I can handle these affairs in Eosia , but taking on Tamuli as well might strain my resources . You have contacts : here , and I do n't . I 'll teach you the business and then lease Tamuli to you . I 'll buy you a title and set things up so that you can start imme-diately. "  | His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why are you being +o generous ? " " I 'm not being generous , Stragen . You will pay your rent every month . I can see to that . And you wo n't pay in coins . I want bullion , Stragen  --  nice , solid bars of gold that I can weigh  --  and do n't try mixing in any copper , either . I 'll have your throat cut if you ever try that . " " You 're the hardest woman I 've ever known , Melidere . " He sounded slightly afraid of her . " Only in some places , Stragen , " she replied archly . " The rest of me is fairly soft . Oh , that reminds me . We 'll be getting married . " " We 'll what ? " " Partnerships are n't made in heaven , Milord ; marriages are . Marriage will give me one more hold on you . " " What if I do n't want to get married ? " He sounded a little desperate now . " That 's just too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will marry me . " " And you 'll have me killed if I do n't , I suppose . " " Of course . I 'm not going to let you run around loose with this information . You 'll get used to the idea , Milord . I 'm in a position to make you deliriously happy  --  and fabulously wealthy to boot . When have you ever had a better offer ? " The look in Stragen 's eyes , however , was one of sheer panic . " Now that was something I did n't expect , " Danae said as she and Sparhawk crossed the lawn . Sparhawk was almost too shocked to answer . " You did n't know about Melidere 's little hobby , you mean ? " " Oh , of course I knew about that , Sparhawk . Melidere bought her way into Mother 's court several years ago . " " Bought ? " " She paid an old countess to step aside for her . What I did n't expect was the direct way she approached Stragen . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all business . She carved him into neat little slices and she did n't give him any room to move at all while she did it . I think I 've misjudged her . " " No , actually you misjudged Stragen . She used the only technique that had any chance of success with him . Stragen 's very slippery . You 've got to pin him to the plate with a fork before you can carve him . He probably would n't have listened to an ordinary marriage pro- ,  | posal , so she was all business with him . The marriage was only an incidental part . " " Not to her , it was n't . " " Yes , I know . She did it right , though . I 'm going to have to tell your mother about this , you know . " " No , actually , you 're not . You heard Melidere . Mother would n't be able to do anything about it , and all you 'd do is worry her . " " They 're stealing millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sparhawk . What they 're going to do in no way changes the value of money . When you get right down to it , they 're actually creating wealth . The whole world will be better for it . " " I do n't entirely follow the logic of that . " " You do n't have to , Father , " she said sweetly . " Just take my word for it . " She pointed . " We want to go over there next . " " Over there , " was beside the moat , where Sephrenia and Vanion walked side by side along the grassy bank . Sparhawk was growing accustomed to his de facto invisibility by now , but it was still strange to have one of his friends look directly at him without acknowledging his presence . " It would depend entirely on what kind of fish were locally avail-able , " Vanion was explaining . Sparhawk could tell that Vanion was explaining because he was using his " explaining " voice , which was quite a bit like his " preaching " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep  --  both in the lecture hall and in chapel . " Why is he talking like that ? " Danae asked . " Because he 's afraid . " Sparhawk sighed . " Of Sephrenia ? Vanion is n't afraid of anything  --  least of all Sephrenia . He loves her . " " That 's what 's making him afraid . He does n't know what to say . If he says the wrong thing , it could all fall apart again . " " Now , " Vanion continued to lecture , " there are warm-water fish and cold-water fish . Carp like the water to be warm , and trout like it colder . " Sephrenia 's eyes were starting to glaze over . " The water in the moat has been standing for quite a while , so it 's fairly warm . That would sort of rule out trout , would n't you say ? " " I suppose so , " she sighed .  | " But that does n't mean that you could n't plant some other kind of fish in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and they do help to keep the water clean . There 's nothing like a school of carp to keep standing water from turning stagnant . " " No , " she sighed . " I 'm sure there is n't . " " What on earth is he doing ? " Danae exploded . " It 's called walking on eggshells , ' " Sparhawk explained . " He probably talks a great deal about the weather , too . " " They 'll never get back together if he does n't talk directly to her about something that matters . " " He probably wo n't do that , Aphrael . I think Sephrenia 's going to have to take the first step . " " I found her ! " Talen 's shout came across the lawn . " She 's up in this tree ! " " Oh , bother ! " Danae said irritably . " He was n't supposed to find her yet  --  and what 's she doing up a tree ? She was n't supposed to climb any trees . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her . " Everybody 's drifting in that direction . You 'd better dissolve your spell . " " What about Vanion and Sephrenia ? " " Why do n't we just let them work it out for themselves ? " " Because he 'll go on talking about fish for the next ten years , that 's why . " " Sephrenia will only listen to lectures about fish for so long , Danae , then she 'll get to the point . Vanion is n't really talking about fish . He 's telling her that he 's ready to make peace if she is . " " He did n't say anything about that . He was just about to start giving her recipes for boiled carp . " " That 's what you heard him saying , but that was n't what he was really saying . You 've got to learn to listen with both ears , Danae . " " Elenes ! " she said , rolling her eyes upward . Then they heard Kalten shout , " Look out ! " Sparhawk looked sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall maple tree . Talen was up among the topmost branches , inching his way slowly out on a very slender limb toward the wild-eyed Mmrr . Things were n't going well . The limb was sturdy enough to support Mmrr , but Talen was too heavy . The limb was bending ominously , and there were unpleasant cracking sounds coming from its base . " Talen , " Kalten shouted again , " get back ! "  | But by then , of course , it was too late . The tree limb did not so much break off from the trunk as it did split at its base and peel down the side of the tree . Talen made a desperate grab , caught the confused and terrified cat in one hand , and then plunged headlong down through the lower branches of the tree . The situation was still not irretrievable . The Church Knights were all versed in various levels of magic , Sephrenia was there , and Aphrael herself rode on Sparhawk 's shoulders . The problem was that no one could actually see Talen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling down through the limbs and was thus totally obscured by the foliage . They could hear him hitting limbs as he fell , a series of raps and thumps accompanied by grunts and sharp cries of pain . Then he emerged from the lower foliage , falling limply to land with a thud on the grass under the tree with Mmrr still loosely held in one hand . He did not get up . " Talen ! " Danae screamed in horror . Sephrenia concurred with the opinion of Sarabian 's physicians . Tales had suffered no really serious injuries . He was bruised and battered , and there was a large , ugly knot on his forehead from his encounter with the unyielding tree limb that had knocked him senseless , but Sephrenia assured them that aside from a splitting headache , he would have no lasting aftereffects from his fall . Princess Danae , however , was in no mood to be reassured . S hovered at the bedside , reacting with little cries of alarm each tim the unconscious boy stirred or made the slightest sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room There were people there who probably should n't witness miracles . " got away from you , did n't it , Aphrael ? " he observed to the distraugt Child-Goddess . " What are you talking about ? " " You had to tamper with things  --  trying to fix things that would have fixed themselves if you 'd just left them alone  --  and you alma got Talen killed in the process . " " It was n't my fault that he fell out of the tree . " " Whose fault was it , then ? " He knew that logically he was being grossly unfair , but he felt that maybe it was time for the meddling little Goddess to be brought up short . " You interfere too much , Aphrael , ' he told her . " People have to be allowed to live their own lives and t make their own mistakes . We can usually fix our mistakes by ourselvse.  | if you 'll just give us the chance . I suppose that what it gets down to is that just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should do it . You might want to think about that . " She stared at him for a long moment , and then she suddenly burst into tears . " Tikume 's bowmen will help , " Vanion said to Sparhawk a bit later when the two stood together on the parapet . " Ulath 's right about Trolls . You definitely want to slow them down before you fight them . " " And Khalad 's idea about the crossbows is n't bad , either . " " Right . Thank God you brought him along . " The preceptor pursed his lips . " I 'd like to have you take personal charge of Khalad 's training when you get him back to Cimmura , Sparhawk . Make sure that he gets instruction in politics , diplomacy , and Church law as well as in military skills . I think he 's going to go a long way in our order , and I want to be sure he 's ready for any position . " " Even yours ? " " Stranger things have happened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you making any progress at all with Sephrenia ? " he asked . " We 're speaking to each other , if that 's what you mean . " " It was n't . Why do n't you just sit down and talk with her ? About mething more significant than the weather , or how many birds can t on a limb , or what kind of fish can live in the moat ? " Vanion gave him a sharp look . " Why do n't you mind your own siness ? " " It is my business , Vanion . She ca n't function while there 's this t between you  --  and neither can you , for that matter . I need you ? h of you  --  and I ca n't really count on either of you until you resolve ur differences . " " I 'm moving as fast as I dare , Sparhawk . One wrong move here uld destroy everything . " " So could a failure to move . She 's waiting for you to take the first step . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out onto the parapet . " He 's awake now , " he reported . " He 's not very coherent , and his eyes are n't focused , but he 's awake . Your daughter 's making quite a fuss over him , Sparhawk . " " She 's fond of him . " Sparhawk shrugged . " She tells everybody t she 's going to marry him someday . " " Little girls are strange , are n't they ? "  | " Oh , yes , and Danae 's stranger than most . " " I 'm glad I was able to catch the two of you alone , " Stragen said then . " There 's something I 'd like to talk over with you before I mention it to the others . " Stragen was absently twiddling two gold Elenic half crowns in his right hand , carefully running one fingertip across the milled edges and hefting them slightly as if trying to determine their weight . Baroness Melidere 's confession appeared to have unsettled him just a bit . " Zalasta 's little fit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be . Turning the Trolls loose on northern Atan was the most disruptive thing he could have done to us . We 'll have to deal with that , of course , but I think we 'd better start preparing for his next move . Trolls do n't need much supervision once they 're been pointed in the right direction , so Zalasta 's free to work on something else now , would n't you say ? " " Probably , " Sparhawk agreed . " Now , I could be wrong ? " " But you do n't think you are , " Vanion completed his sentence sardonically . " He 's in a touchy mood today , is n't he ? " Stragen said to Spar-hawk . " He 's got a lot on his mind . " " It 's my guess that whatever Zalasta comes up with next is goin to involve those conspirators Sarabian and Ehlana left in place for lac of jail cells . " " It could just as easily involve the armies Parok , Amador , an Elron have raised in western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Those armies were raised to keep th Church Knights off the continent , Lord Vanion , and they were rais at Cyrgon 's specific orders . If Zalasta risked them now , he 'd have t answer to Cyrgon for it , and I do n't think he 's that brave yet . " " Maybe you 're right , " Vanion conceded . " All right , let 's say th he will use those second-level conspirators . Sarabian and Ehlana ha already set things in motion to round them up . " " Why bother rounding them up at all , my Lord ? " " To get them off the streets , for one thing . Then there 's also th small detail of the fact that they 're guilty of high treason . They ne to be tried and punished . " " Why ? " " As an example , you idiot ! " Vanion flared . " I 'll agree that getting them off the streets is important , Lo  | Vanion , but there are more effective ways to make examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain . When you send policemen out to arrest people , it 's noisy , and usually others hear the noise and manage to escape . There 's also the fact that trials are tedious , expensive , and not absolutely certain . " " You 've got an alternative in mind , I gather , " Sparhawk said . " Naturally . Why not have the executions first and the trials later ? " They stared at him . " I 'm sort of extending the idea I had the other day , " Stragen said . " Caalador and I have access to a number of nonsqueamish professionals who can carry out the executions privately . " " You 're talking about murder , Stragen , " Vanion accused . " Why , yes , Lord Vanion , I believe that is the term some people do use to describe it . The whole idea behind examples ' is to frighten others so much that they wo n't commit the same crime . It does n't really work , because criminals know that their chances of being caught and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just one of the hazards of doing business . We professional criminals break laws all the time . We do n't , however , break our own rules . People in our society who break the rules are n't afforded the courtesy of being tried . They 're just killed . No acquittals , no pardons , no last-minute jailbreaks . Dead . Pemod . Case closed . The justice of regular society is slow and uncertain . Ours is just the opposite . If you want to use terror to keep people honest , use real terror . " " It has got possibilities , Vanion , " Sparhawk suggested tentatively . " You 're not seriously considering it , are you ? There are thousands of those people out there ! You 're talking about the largest mass murder In history ! " " It 's a way to get my name in the record books . " Stragen shrugged . " Caalador and I are probably going to do this anyway . We 're both Impatient men . I would n't have bothered you about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views on the subject . Should we tell Sarabian and Ehlana , or should we just go ahead and not bother them ? Discussions shout relative morality are so tedious , do n't you think ? The point here that we need to come up with something that will unhinge Zalasta II the more , and I think this might be it . If he wakes up some morning the not-too-distant future and finds himself absolutely and totally alone , it might give him some second thoughts about the wisdom of course . And oh , incidentally , I 've borrowed Berit and Xanetia . They 're taking a stroll in the vicinity of the Cynesgan embassy so that  | Xanetia can run that dip net of hers through the minds of the people inside . We 've got quite a few names , but I 'm sure there are more . " " Does n't she have to be in the same room with somebody to listen to his thoughts ? " Vanion asked . " She 's not really certain . She 's never had occasion to test the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nature of an experiment . We 're hoping that she 'll be able to reach in through the walls and pull out the names of the people inside . If she ca n't , I 'll find some way to get her inside so that she can seine out what we need . Caalador and I want as much information and as many names as we can get . Setting up the largest mass murder in history is a very complicated business , and we do n't want to have to do it twice . "  | " It 's diversionary , " Ulath said the next morning . He lowered one of the dispatches Emperor Sarabian had brought with him . " The werewolves and vampires and ghouls are just illusions , so they ca n't really hurt anybody , and these attacks on Atan garrisons are no more than suicidal gestures intended to keep things confused . This is just more of what they were doing before . " " He 's right , " Sparhawk agreed . " None of this is new , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atans in place . " " Unfortunately , it 's succeeding very well , " Bevier said . " We ca n't reduce the Atan garrisons by very much to send help to Betuana with all this going on . " " Lord Vanion 's idea of detaching platoon-sized units from the main garrisons should help a little , " Sarabian protested . " Yes , your Majesty , " Bevier replied , " but will it be enough ? " " It 's going to have to be , " Vanion said . " It 's all we can spare right now . We 're talking about Atans , though , and numbers are n't that significant where they 're concerned . One Atan is half an army all by himself . " Stragen motioned to Sparhawk , and the two of them drifted over to the long table laden with breakfast . The blond thief carefully sekcted a pastry . " It worked , " he said quietly . " Xanetia has to be able to see the person whose thoughts she 's stealing , but Berit found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the embassy . Xanetia 's got a comfortable room to sit in with a window that faces  | the ambassador 's office . She 's picking up all sorts of information  --  and names  --  for us . " " Why are we keeping this from the others ? " " Because Caalador and I are going to use the information to set that new world record I was telling you about yesterday . Sarabian has n't authorized it yet , so let 's not upset him over something he does n't need to know about  --  at least not until we 've stacked all the bodies in neat piles . " Princess Danae fell ill the next day . It was nothing clearly definable . There was no fever , no rash , and no cough involved  --  only a kind of listless weakness . The princess seemed to have no appetite , and it was difficult to wake her . " It 's the same thing as it was last month , " Mirtai assured the little girl 's worried parents . " She needs a tonic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mirtai was wrong . Danae had not really been ill the previous month . The Child-Goddess made light of her ability to be in two places at the same time , but her father knew that when her attention was firmly fixed on what was going on in one place , she would be semicomatose in the other . This illness was quite different , somehow . " Why do n't you go ahead and try a tonic , Eh-lana ? " he suggested . " I 'll go talk with Sephrenia . Maybe she can think of something else . " He found Sephrenia sitting moodily in her room . She was looking out the window , although it was fairly obvious that she did not even see the view . " We 've got a problem , little mother , " Sparhawk said , closing the door behind him . " Danae 's sick . " She turned sharply , her eyes startled . " That 's absurd , Sparhawk . She does n't get sick . She ca n't . " " I did n't think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's nothing really tangible , no overt symptoms or anything like that , but sne 's definitely not well . " Sephrenia rose quickly . " I 'd better go have a look , " she said . " Maybe I can get her to tell me what 's wrong . Is she alone ? " " No . Ehlana 's with her . I do n't think she 'll be willing to leave . Wo n't that complicate things ? " " I 'll take care of it . Let 's get to the bottom of this before it goes any further . " Sephrenia 's obvious concern worried Sparhawk all the more . He  | followed her back to the royal quarters with growing apprehension . She was right about one thing . Aphrael was not in any way susceptible to human illnesses , so this was no simple miasmic fever or one of the innumerable childhood diseases that all humans catch , endure , and get over . He dismissed out of hand the notion that there could be such a thing as the sniffles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Styric spell before she even entered Danae 's room . " Thank God you 're here , Sephrenia ! " Ehlana exclaimed , half rising from her chair beside the little girl 's bed . " I 've been so ? " Sephrenia released the spell with a curious flick of her hand , and Ehlana 's eyes went blank . She froze in place , half-risen from her chair and with one hand partially extended . Sephrenia approached the bed , sat on the edge of it , and took the little girl in her arms . " Aphrael , " she said , " wake up . It 's me ? Sephrenia . " The Child-Goddess opened her eyes and began to cry . " What is it ? " Sephrenia asked , holding her sister even more tightly and rocking back and forth with her . " They 're killing my children , Sephrenia ! " Aphrael wailed . " All over Eosia ! The Elenes are killing my children ! I want to die ! " " We have to go to Sarsos , " Sephrenia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three of them were alone . " I have to talk with the Thousand . " " I know that it 's breaking her heart , " Vanion said , " but it ca n't really hurt her , can it ? " " It could kill her , Vanion . The younger Gods are so totally Involved with their worshippers that their very lives depend on them . Please , Sparhawk , ask Bhelliom to take us to Sarsos immedi-ately . " Sparhawk nodded bleakly and took out the box , touching his ring to the lid . " Open ! " He said it more sharply than he 'd intended . The lid snapped up . " Blue-Rose , " Sparhawk said , " a crisis hath arisen . The ChildGoddess is made gravely ill by reason of the murder of her worshippers In far-off Eosia . We must at once to Sarsos that Sephrenia might consult with the Thousand of Styricum regarding a cure . " " It shall be as thou dost require , Anakha . " The words came
