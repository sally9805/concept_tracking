DENZEL DOWN LOW <P> Even the N.B.A. 's off season ca n't sideline basketball 's mouthiest trash talker . Spike Lee is calling the shots on the set of He Got Game . DENZEL WASHINGTON had to adapt his style to Spike 's X 's and 0 's . Denzel 's screen personas usually range from the inhumanly brave to the downright angelic , but in Game he plays the ultimate deadbeat dad . His character , Jake Shuttlesworth , is doing time for killing his wife . Freedom beckons , in the form of a Governor 's pardon , if he can persuade his estranged son Jesus , a high school basketball star played by Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen , to sign with an agent . The movie , produced by Swishin ' an ' Dishin ' , has not yet been sold for distribution , and Lee expects to wrap up filming on Coney Island early in October . In time for the season 's first tip-off . <P> TO SIN OR NOT TO SIN , ASKS JOHN <P> An editor 's work is never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of George , in which JOHN F. KENNEDY JR . goes to great lengths to boost his magazine 's circulation . To complement the cover photo of a nude Kate Moss as Eve , Kennedy sits bare-chested and bare-kneed in dark shadow , gazing pensively at an apple . In the editor 's letter , he ruminates on the nature of temptation  --  " I 'm playing Hamlet with my willpower ( Should I or should n't I ? ) . " The literary reference must suffice to convey his torment because he coyly declines to reveal the snakes in his Garden . Instead , he breaks the Kennedy-clan mantra of loyalty no matter what the crime by observing that cousin Joseph , who tried to annul his first marriage , and cousin Michael , who dallied with the baby-sitter , had become the " poster boys for bad behavior . " Being just a poster boy , after all , is so much seemlier . <P> BUT WILL SHE WEAR WHITE ? <P> All it took was a few fuzzy photos for Britain to go bananas over its favorite fractured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cozying up to playboy DODI FAYED , the Sunday Mirror declared authoritatively , " The whole world can see it 's a book of love . " The tabloids were busy reading the little black book of Dodi 's past paramours ( Brooke Shields , Winona Ryder et al. ) when jilted model Kelly Fisher held a press conference , claiming Dodi as her betrothed and flashing a sapphire ring and a $440,000 breach-of-contract and fraud suit . Diana 's future wedded abode was hotly debated : Would it be Julie Andrews ' former Malibu home , reportedly just purchased by Dodi , or the Paris love nest of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor , now owned by the father-in-law-to-be ? No word yet on a honeymoon site . <P> SEEN &; HEARD <P> Sitting ringside at the Tyson-Holyfield bout in June apparently gave Christian Slater all the wrong ideas . The toothsome actor turned downright mean at an L.A. party , allegedly punching his girlfriend and biting a man who tried to come to her aid . Facing possible charges of assault , Slater later issued a statement expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be like Mikey . Remember the freckle-faced kid who decides oats are n't so bad after all ? Well , Mikey grew up , and Life cereal boxes needed a new mug . Out of 35,000 entrants , Marli , 4 , will be coming to a supermarket near you . She likes Life but cautions , " It gets boring to eat the same thing every day . " <P> BLOW LIKE ME
