Snowcapped in winter and precipitous in many places , the Pindus Mountains , which straddle Greece and Albania , are all but impassable . That has not stopped thousands of desperate Albanians from crossing into Greece since the last week of 1990 . In early December , four fleeing Albanians were shot dead ( near the frontier by soldiers of the Stalinist regime in Tirana . Last week , by contrast , refugees walked into Greece with little to deter them except the cold and the mountains . Instead of opening fire , border guards merely shot curses at the fugitives . By week 's end about 5,000 refugees streamed into the northwestern Greek province of Epirus , doubling the population of the border area . Most of the fugitives belonged to Albania 's large Greek minority , leaving territory once disputed by the two countries . <P> But even as Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis extended temporary- resident status to refugees claiming Greek ancestry , he pleaded with ethnic Greeks still in Albania to stay home to prevent a " national disaster . " As for refugees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish that the idea will ripen that they will return to their homeland . " <P> With few volunteers for the trip back to Albania and more refugees expected in the months to come , Mitsotakis scheduled a trip to Tirana .

According to spokesman Polydoras in Athens , Alia is trying to rid himself of the Greeks before the vote scheduled for February because the ethnic group , which exceeds 10% of the population , is opposed to his rule . <P> Fearing persecution , ethnic Greeks chose to flee at the first word that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countryside the refugees left behind is a wasteland of want . Virtually the only meat rural families saw last year was half a chicken distributed to each household on Nov. 29 , the National Day . By contrast , even the icy refugee camps , such as Kalpaki in northern Greece , seem like paradise , providing shelter and plentiful food . Said a high- ranking Greek official : " The question is , Where does one draw the line ? We do n't want to make them feel too comfortable because we want them to go back . " But back to what ?
