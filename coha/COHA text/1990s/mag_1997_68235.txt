Players ran frantically from the shower stalls wearing nothing but soapsuds , screaming and howling as if the cold water had been turned off . A few other San Francisco Giants scooted out of the trainer 's room , suddenly not feeling so sore , and leftfielder Barry Bonds bounced out of the manager 's office , where he had been sitting alone in front of the television . The players converged under the big TV in the middle of the visitors ' clubhouse in San Diego 's Qualcomm Stadium as the room erupted in celebration : bodies slamming , palms slapping , men shouting so loudly they could probably be heard up the road at Dodger Stadium . // In this season of assaults on the baseball record book , we must add another new mark : loudest celebration by a team that just lost by 10 runs . We can only imagine what the Giants would have done had they beaten the Padres last Saturday . Had a group hug , perhaps ? " This is probably the happiest I 've ever seen a team that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darryl Hamilton . " Here 's the way I look at it : At this time of year , it 's better to be lucky than good . " // The Giants have been good for most of this season . On Saturday they settled for lucky . They got waxed by the Padres 12-2 , but they barely had time to sulk because their rivals just north on Interstate 5 were doing their best to cheer them up . As many of the Giants watched on TV , Los Angeles Dodgers pinch hitter Eddie Murray ended the game by grounding into a bases-loaded double play , his second in three days , and L.A. dropped a 2-1 decision to the Colorado Rockies for its fourth straight loss . San Francisco retained a one-game lead in the National League West despite the pounding by the Padres . " Everyone went wild , " Giants second baseman Jeff Kent said later . " I had to remind them that we just lost . It sure does n't feel that way . " // " Feels like we got away with one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a classic scene from an old-fashioned pennant race , and this year , in case you have n't noticed , the National League West is the only place you can find one . In the rest of the major leagues , the last week of the regular season is about as scintillating as a farm report . The expanded playoff system adopted three years ago has , like a bad diet , caught up with baseball , turning the once precious final week of September into a meaningless prelude to the postseason . The Giants and the Dodgers reminded us how much fun this time of year can be . " After one game against L.A. last week , " said San Francisco manager Dusty Baker , " our bat-boy came up to me and told me he was drained . I said , ' How do you think I feel ? ' " // While baseball owners were meeting in Atlanta to discuss ways to create rivalries , the Giants and the Dodgers were busy proving that you ca n't force a good feud . Sometimes it takes decades to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been slugging it out on two coasts for 107 years , and if last week was any indication , their enmity is as strong as ever . The teams met twice in San Francisco , and 3Com Park crackled with energy . Two weeks after only 8,565 fans showed up for a game against Houston , the Giants drew more than 102,000 for two midweek duels with the despised Dodgers , and the fans were nearly as fired up as the Giants . Baker 's club won both games by a run . San Francisco 's 12-inning , 6-5 triumph last Thursday afternoon was a classic , and after catcher Brian Johnson launched the game-winning solo home run ' off Mark Guthrie , the race was a dead heat with nine games to go . The best rivalry in baseball got even better , and September baseball was saved . " I 've been in the playoffs before , and this two-game series was better , " said Kent . Hey , Bud . Realign this ! // Last weekend the Giants went on to San Diego , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat the Padres 8-5 on Sunday . Meanwhile the Dodgers lost three straight at home to the Rockies to fall two games behind . As if the Dodgers were n't feeling the forces of nature against them already , in the first game of the Colorado series they lost to Pedro Astacio , a pitcher they had traded for second baseman Eric Young last month and had since voted a playoff share . Someone should have told Pedro he might have cost himself some money . // San Francisco will finish the season this weekend at home against the Padres . The Dodgers will travel to Colorado for their final four games . The schedule seems to favor the Giants , but the Dodgers remain the most talented team in the division . " I still think this is coming down to a one-game playoff , " says L.A. starter Tom Candiotti . " It 's destiny . Come on . You know it 's going to happen . " // The teams have split 12 games this year and have been separated by no more than two games in September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco had lost four straight on the road , in Florida and Atlanta , and appeared to be fading . Some observers said the plucky Giants had no right to be in the race in the first place : They had finished last the past two seasons ( no team has ever finished first after two straight years in the basement ) and had traded slugger Matt Williams to Cleveland in the off-season . " To be honest , when I signed with the Giants I was hoping maybe we 'd have a shot at the playoffs next year , " says Hamilton , who left Texas as a free agent after last season . " This year ? I did n't think so . I do n't blame all the writers for picking us to finish last again , because when you 're sitting up in the press box you ca n't see all the heart this team has . " // In a matchup with L.A. , the Giants have a clear edge not only in heart but also in leftfield . The Dodgers get the nod just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have as much chance against the Dodgers as Beck would have against Los Angeles catcher Mike Piazza in a bachelor auction . The disparity in talent levels only adds to the drama : Here are the Giants , a colorful patchwork of retreads and rejects , arranged nicely around the inimitable Bonds . Of the Giants ' starting lineup and rotation , only third baseman Bill Mueller is a product of San Francisco 's farm system . Los Angeles , on the other hand , has four regular position players and four starting pitchers who are homegrown . The Dodgers are second in the National League in ERA ( 3.60 through Sunday ) and fourth in batting ( .267 ) . They 've had five straight rookies of the year , and Piazza has a shot at MVP this season . Los Angeles is held up as the model franchise in major league baseball . " Which is kind of arrogant , if you ask me , " says Beck . // The Giants ? If you do n't count the standings , they lead the National League in two all-important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start of the week San Francisco had 58 sac flies , which is 58 more than Murray had for the Dodgers in his two bases-loaded , one-out at bats last week . Remarkably the Giants , who are 11th in the league in hitting , with a .257 average , have scored 31 fewer runs this season than they have allowed ( 737 to 768 through Sunday ) . The Dodgers have outscored their opponents by 85 runs ( 701-616 ) . Even Bonds , who homered in three consecutive games last week , is n't having a career year . He leads the Giants with 37 homers but has driven in just 96 runs . A three-time National League MVP , Bonds may not even be the MVP of his team this year . " We ca n't expect Barry to carry us , and he is n't expecting to carry us , " says Kent , who has driven in 114 runs . " Everyone knows he 's got to step up and do his part . We ca n't just look to Barry . He has n't carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , are residing in a different universe . For them to consider this season a success , they have to not only make the playoffs but also win some postseason games . They have been swept out of the playoffs in the past two years , and there could be only one thing worse than allowing that to happen again : losing the National League West title to the ragtag Giants . " If we do n't win the division , this season has been an absolute waste , " says Piazza. // The Giants and the Dodgers are vastly different outfits off the field as well as on . Most members of the media picked San Francisco to finish last , the fans stayed away and team management did n't pursue contract extensions for most of the soon-to-be free agents . The Giants snuck up on everyone . " This team ca n't hold a candle to the White Sox team I was on as far as talent , " says reliever Roberto Hernandez , who came from Chicago in a trade with fellow pitchers Danny Darwin and Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team has heart . " // Although the Giants have their share of grizzled veterans , they 're playing with the raw enthusiasm of a team that just qualified for the Little League world series . In the second game of the L.A. series , the Dodgers loaded the bases off Beck in the 10th . When Baker left Beck on the mound to win or lose the game , the home crowd booed . Beck struck out Todd Zeile and coaxed a ground ball to second from Murray . When Kent threw home for the unusual 4-2-3 double play to end the threat , Baker turned to the crowd and pumped his fists . Beck was cheered like a rock star . If this had been a college football game , the Giants would have received a 15-yard penalty for excessive celebration . // Two innings later , Johnson ripped a shot through the wind and over the leftfield fence to end the game and send 3Com into a frenzy . Bonds bounded out of the dugout and pounded on home plate as if to remind Johnson where to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted him as if they had just won a New Year 's Day bowl game . The Dodgers were left to watch and wonder who among the Giants had just cured cancer . " We 'll remember the celebrating they did , believe me , " says L.A. manager Bill Russell . // The Giants do n't seem to care . They are n't going to let petty baseball protocol spoil the party . " You would n't be human if you did n't feel the highs and lows , " says Baker . " We 're playing a game we love . This is n't life or death . We 're like those surfer dudes out on the ocean . When you get up on a good wave , you ride it as long as you can . " Just like those surfer dudes  --  is n't that what Earl Weaver said when the Baltimore Orioles won the World Series ? // To a man , the Giants credit Baker with keeping things loose and letting them play . " How can you not like playing for Dusty ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on time and do n't lie to me . He makes it fun to be here . Everyone 's friends . " // When the Giants were in Cincinnati last month , Beck says , a couple of veterans made plans to go to dinner and invited the rest of the team along as a courtesy . Sixteen San Francisco players showed up , an unheard-of turnout these days , according to Beck . " Even in ' 93 , when we dominated everyone , it was n't like that , " he says . " I mean , we did n't need 25 cabs , but maybe 15 . This team , we could jump in the same pickup truck and go out , we get along that good . " // Down the coast , things are a little different . The Dodgers have many strengths as a ball club , but camaraderie is n't one of them . L.A. players last week quietly questioned some of Russell 's moves , including his dependence on the cement-footed Murray  --  a September call-up who wo n't be eligible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Our chemistry stinks . It never got any better . We just started winning . " // Then they stopped . The Dodgers , at the start of the final week , had lost 10 of 13 games and were feeling the pressure of the pennant race . The Giants ? What do they care ? They caught a wave a long time ago and are still enjoying the ride . " To me it does n't matter what we do now  --  it was still special , " says Hamilton . " To be picked to finish last and still have a shot at the playoffs in the last week of the season , that 's magical . " // This is a magical time . The last week of September , the last pennant race in baseball . Giants and Dodgers . The only baseball meetings that matter .
