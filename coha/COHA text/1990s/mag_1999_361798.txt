For Palmer McArthur , 74 , and his wife Mary , 73 , it was the trip of a lifetime . At the Bitter End Yacht Club in Virgin Gorda , British Virgin Islands , they had the chance in June to be with their four children , their spouses and 14 grandchildren . It posed no problem that June is off-season in the Caribbean . The weather there is consistent throughout the year , with temperatures averaging 80degrees F to 90degrees F , and the Bitter End staff was able to give the McArthurs lots of personal attention , including organizing activities for all three generations . Better yet , traveling in June meant a savings of 39% . The vacation cost them several thousand dollars less than it would have cost in high season . <P> The world changes little in a day , but getting around in the world can change dramatically in just 24 hrs. , which is often the difference between high season and low season  --  and the vastly different prices attached to each . You can pay top dollar one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation . No group of travelers is better positioned to take advantage of off-season bargains than those of us , like Palmer and Mary , who are no longer tied down by children or 9-to-5 jobs . Bargains are n't the only rewards of off-season travel . There are fewer crowds and shorter lines , as well as learning opportunities and activity programs offered by hotels and cruise lines looking to fill rooms when demand is low . <P> O.K. , there 's a catch : off-peak travel can mean less than ideal weather . Choose Europe in November , and you may get cold and rain . Venture to Florida or the Caribbean in July , and you may find it extremely hot and humid . There may be fewer sites and programs available , and those that are running often have restricted hours or days of operation . The charming green markets and eclectic stalls of crafts and clothing that line streets in peak season may have disappeared ; the golf course you play may not be in top condition . But if you 're willing to bend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for the taking . <P> WHAT 'S FARE IS FARE <P> Finding the best deal on airfares can be an exercise in frustration , largely because no human being can fully comprehend the airlines ' byzantine pricing system . Yet somewhere within that maze , savings are available  --  especially if you 're able to burrow down deep into the Internet or participate in online ticket auctions . As you do so , though , remember that traditional travel agents , who have the time to research all possibilities for you , still have a role to play . <P> They know , for example , that most airlines have senior discounts for travelers age 62 or older , primarily in the form of coupon booklets good for four one-way or two round-trip segments . All four coupons can usually be used for one round trip to Hawaii . Northwest 's senior coupon booklet costs $560 ; Delta 's and American 's are $596 . The greatest savings with these coupons occur if you have to fly at the last minute or if you want to fly to several cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  two scenarios for which the airlines charge a premium rate . Hawaii can be a bargain too . Flights from Denver to Honolulu are booking at about $714 , giving coupon holders a savings of as much as $154 per ticket .
