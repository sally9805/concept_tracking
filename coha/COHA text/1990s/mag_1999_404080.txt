The distance from here to the edge of the universe is 13 billion light-years-and growing by the minute . // Often when I view the distant universe , I think of being on a ship at sea . Far from land , the lines of sight to the aquatic horizon may reach a dozen miles in every direction , depending on the height of the deck from which you observe . This circle , with the ship at its center and the horizon as its perimeter , marks the boundary between what you can and can not see . For all you know , the horizon encloses all the water there is , and you just happen to be at its center . Experience proves this wrong . In the open ocean you can sail for hours and hours and days and days and see nothing but water , water , everywhere . An ocean is , of course , much , much larger than the part that happens to lie within your horizon . Likewise , the distance from here to our cosmic horizon is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe . We might further claim that the entire universe is much , much larger than the part that happens to fall within our view . Not unlike the circle that traces our oceanic horizon , the cosmic horizon is a sphere-a round shell that surrounds us completely . The exact distance to this " edge " remains uncertain , but the latest and best estimates are about 13 billion light-years in every direction . A much smaller horizon , although perhaps the scariest in town , is the one surrounding a black hole-the infamous " event horizon . " At this foreboding place , a black hole 's gravity is so strong that according to Einstein 's general theory of relativity ( the modern theory of gravity ) , space has warped completely back upon itself If you fell across this horizon , you would swiftly reach the black hole 's center , and you would never come back . En route to the center , the rapidly increasing gravity across your body would rip apart your flesh , atom by atom , as the fabric of space and time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us ignore that complication for the time being . The moment you cross the event horizon , there is no speed at which to travel , no path to take through space , and no negotiation with the laws of physics that would enable you to escape . You fall through a one-way hole from which nothing emerges , not even light . Well , almost nothing . The physicist Stephen Hawking has shown that individual particles can spontaneously appear outside a black hole 's event horizon . These particles , known as Hawking radiation , have " tunneled " their way out . Tunneling is one of the many exotic phenomena predicted and experimentally verified by the branch of physics called quantum mechanics , which primarily addresses the counterintuitive behavior of particles , atoms , and molecules . But if you fall into a black hole , do n't count on Hawking radiation as an escape mechanism . The process is so slow that it would take a few billion years for one body-mass-worth of particles to get out-one by one . And even if you could wait that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the nuclear level . Photograph Formed less than a billion light-years after the big bang , the bright galaxy in the lower right quadrant of the image is the most distant yet discovered . // Black holes are celestial objects that have collapsed to a single point at their own center of mass . By convention , however , a black hole 's size is expressed by the dimensions of its event horizon , which grows as the hole dines upon matter that wanders too close . The collapse of a star that was born with , say , twenty times the mass of the Sun ( measuring twenty million miles across ) leads to a black hole whose event horizon spans a dozen miles . Some black holes are behemoths that lurk at the centers of galaxies . They are another breed entirely . Birthed along with the galaxies early in the history of the universe , these holes can " weigh in " at up to billions of times the Sun 's mass . Their event horizons would fill our solar system . Stars , star clusters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event horizon , releasing stupendous amounts of energy in all bands of light just before entering the black hole . These galactic engines are visible across the universe as energetic quasars or as ordinary galaxies with suspiciously luminous central regions . The event horizons of black holes may be dark and unpleasant , but light can form horizons of its own . One is the visible edge of the Sun , which is not a solid boundary between star and space but a gaseous " surface " from which visible light photons freely emerge . The Sun is a big hot ball of ionized gas , where electrons have been stripped from their host atoms and are free to roam . In this busy place , photons and electrons are very good at batting each other to and fro . On Earth , a similar thing happens on foggy days . The suspended water vapor in fog inhibits the free passage of visible light photons by batting them into random directions , compromising your ability to see . Books do n't often say so , but the published size of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you took the Sun 's measurements using a different band of light say , ultraviolet or infrared-its size would be slightly different because those photons escape from different depths within the Sun 's outer layers . And if you looked at the Sun using only high-energy photons , you could justifiably define its outer surface as lying within its hot , rarefied , ever-changing corona-a copious emitter of X rays , with expansive dimensions several times those of the visible Sun . But suppose you wanted to " see " the thermonuclear fusion in the Sun 's core ? You would need a special telescope that did not depend on light ; you would further need to detect something that is emitted at the site of the fusion and that exits the Sun without incident . That emitted " something " is an elusive subatomic particle called the neutrino , a byproduct of many kinds of nuclear reactions , including the conversion of hydrogen into helium-the Sun 's favorite pastime . Neutrinos hardly ever interact with anything and therefore blow past all the layers of the Sun , escaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neutrino vision would thus enable you to declare the Sun 's size to be that of its thermonuclear core . Like the Sun , the universe has an edge beyond which light can not freely travel . Evidence for this impenetrable wall comes to us in the form of cosmic background radiation left over from the big bang . Where did the wall come from ? Although light travels swiftly , the distances between us and other galaxies in the universe are so vast that we see things not as they are but as they once weremillions and billions of years ago , back when the universe was smaller , denser , and hotter . These galaxies float in full view above our heads , and like geological strata , they form a time line of cosmic history . If you look far enough away , to when the universe was a mere half-million years old , you will see the remnant light from a time when the entire universe was as hot as a star . And there , as in a star , photons and unattached electrons bat each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impenetrable by light . As the universe expanded and cooled , the obstructing electrons attached themselves to atomic nuclei and formed complete atoms . Photons that had previously been pummeled suddenly traveled freely across the cosmos . This boundary between opaque and transparent space , half a million years after the big bang , is known in cosmology as the era of recombination . If you want to " see " any farther back in time , ordinary telescopes that view ordinary light will not do . But if we were able to build a precision neutrino telescope , we could part the electron curtain and see the universe at a time much closer to the big bang itself . We would be able to see back to the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into light elements such as helium and lithium , which took place minutes after the big bang . The mother of all horizons-the one at the edge of the cosmos-is set by the speed of light and the age of the universe . No matter our technology or technique , we can not see farther away than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , because the universe is only 13 billion years old . This cosmic sphere , with a radius of 13 billion lightyears , is centered in space and time on whoever is making the observation . Moving at the speed of light , the expanding horizon continuously overtakes parts of the cosmos that were previously on its other side . In a billion years , when the universe is 14 billion years old , we will have seen another billion years of cosmic evolution at every distance between here and there , and we will have seen another spherical shell of cosmic material that has undergone the big bang and given birth to galaxies . The galaxies whose light will have taken 14 billion years to reach us will come into view only after the universe has reached 14 billion years of age . Since the entire universe , including the parts beyond our cosmic horizon , participated in the big bang , then the cosmic background radiation will always remain in view , albeit at an ever increasing distance , and there will always be a crop of galaxies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stars we call the Milky Way galaxy , we can wait ( who knows how long ? ) and watch for the cosmic background to disappear . That would be the first indication that the universe has no more material for our horizon to enclose . No more material for us to catch in the act of big banging . And we might thenceforth sleep confidently , knowing that all there is , is within our horizon , and all there is n't , is n't . Our map of the universe would be complete . But if the speed of light were suddenly infinite , we would lose our ability to look back in time , and all direct evidence of the hot big bang would disappear . There would be no cosmic horizon , and we would see 13-billion-year-old galaxies everywhere we looked , out to the dimmest objects our largest telescopes could detect . In the universe we 've been dealt , however , we are indeed afloat , perhaps adrift , centered among a hundred billion other galaxies , brethren in space , ancestors in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . From our cosmic horizonthere and then-to our Milky Way galaxy-here and now-our expanding sphere of space and time is just part , likely a small part , of a meta-universe whose size we do not know and whose true nature we can not imagine .
