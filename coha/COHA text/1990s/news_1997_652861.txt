<p> The Western world has no other realm quite like Mount Athos , a rugged tongue of land in northern Greece where 20 Orthodox monasteries rise in crescendo from the rocks and the forests . For the past millennium , the whole peninsula has been a site for monastic settlements , a secret chain of sprawling compounds and hundreds of smaller houses and hermits ' hideaways . <p> The oldest buildings are virtual fortresses , with arsenals and defensive towers , the telltale marks of a time when the monks had to fight off pirates , Christian crusaders , Ottoman Turks . But the monks of the holy mountain have not only held on to their refuge , they have also kept alive an unbroken tradition of study and liturgy . Today , their abode survives as the spiritual focus for all of the Eastern Orthodox world . <p> Over the centuries , the monks have gathered a trove of priceless objects , including an estimated 20,000 icons and some 15,000 manuscripts , that rank among the world 's most outstanding collections . Yet while Mount Athos has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriarchs , it has always kept its extraordinary artwork to itself . Much is still uncatalogued . Even scholars have not seen many of the pieces ; women have always been barred from the peninsula , and men need special permits from the community to enter the 140-square-mile theocracy . <p> This year , for the first time in their history , the monks have opened their vaults , churches and libraries and allowed part of their treasures to be displayed at the Museum of Byzantine Culture in Salonika , Greece 's second largest city . The exhibition presents far from their full collection , and 4 of the 20 monasteries , while giving their blessing , declined to take part . But what was brought from the mountain is amazing : more than 1,500 objects that offer a mesmerizing glimpse of Athos 's hidden sphere . <p> The exhibit sweeps from the 10th to the 19th century and includes exquisitely illustrated manuscripts , silver chalices and crosses , embroideries and vestments sparkling with gold . There are the humbler paraphernalia of the monks , like candlesticks , belt buckles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals . <p> But pride of place goes to the icons , the most revered of Orthodox art forms . They are omnipresent and compelling , 110 in all , made by monks , commissioned by them or received as gifts . Some tell stories from the Bible or the lives of saints ; most are meant for prayer , and these are the classic , flattened figures , suspended on a gold background , yet vivid and direct and possessed almost with a magnetic force . <p> It is this emphasis on the spiritual rather than the historical that most distinguishes " Treasures of Mount Athos " from the " Glory of Byzantium " show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York earlier this year . While that show focused on the apex of the Byzantine Empire between the 9th and the 13th centuries , it presented far fewer objects , gathered from 117 collections in 24 nations . The only items the Met obtained from Mount Athos were three illustrated books , a curator of the New York show said . <p> Preparations for the Salonika exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago and heated up when it became known that Salonika would be designated this year 's cultural capital of Europe . <p> " The monks did not see the point , " said Dimitra Gouryioti , one of the show 's designers . " They made it clear that the entire holy mountain is a treasure for them . They felt the objects could not talk outside their own surroundings . " <p> In the end , historians , theologians and even politicians persuaded the monks that showing their way of life and spirituality was valuable for the Orthodox faith . <p> Moreover , the monks are responding to a renewed interest in Orthodoxy in Greece that is drawing visitors , seeking cultural roots or spiritual guidance , to monasteries all over the country . <p> In its heyday , Mount Athos had up to 40,000 monks . By 1970 , that number had dwindled to 1,145 aging men . Today , the monastic community appears to be reviving with an influx of young , university-educated people . Just in the last decade , 600 new candidates arrived at Athos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The success of the show has impressed even the monks , who " told us they were touched and honored , " Mrs. Gouryioti said . <p> The exhibition has already drawn some 350,000 visitors from across the Balkans and other countries with Orthodox Christians , far more people than the small , new museum can comfortably handle . Organizers are now lobbying the monks to allow the show , due to close on Dec. 31 , to remain open till March 31 . <p> What differentiates " Treasures of Mount Athos " from other trophy shows of this decade is that , for all its scale , the exhibition conveys a sense of intimacy and even mysticism . The goal , as requested by the monks , was not to display the objects for their own sake , but as woven into the life of Athos . <p> Designers therefore have built a museum within the museum : ramps to suggest the rising terrain , passages , archways and a chapel to suggest the close quarters of an ancient monastery . Objects are shown not as single precious items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed , evoking some of the sacred clutter of an Orthodox church . Recalling a Time Of Expansion <p> The show opens with a piece from the 10th century , the era when the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity formally divided . For Orthodoxy this was a good time : the long armed conflict over the veneration of icons , known as iconoclasm , had ended ; monasteries were also expanding on Athos , where religious recluses had settled since the early 800 's . <p> The first piece , then , is emblematic : a 10th-century marble relief of a peacock , symbol of vanity and of paradise . Its chiseled inscription reads , " The recollection of death is useful in life . " Facing the peacock , as if in dialogue with it , is a full-length painting of a monk . <p> Anna Trivella , an art historian at the museum , pointed out that this opening scene is linked to the end of the show : the same monk stands near an icon of the dead Jesus , which in turn is followed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is a way of showing circular time , which is what sacred time is . " <p> One section of the exhibit includes objects from daily life . Clocks are a reminder that the monks still follow the Julian calendar , which is 13 days behind the Gregorian one ; the day begins at sunset . Another section is devoted to music . Chanting , of course , is an essential part of Orthodoxy , and theologians say that on feast days services at Athos may last up to 12 hours . <p> Women may not set foot on the holy mountain , but some of their work is present in superb embroidery work . There are robes , stoles , chasubles , miters and tapestries that would seem to come from the hands of goldsmiths . A number of pieces have been traced back to celebrated workshops run by women in Constantinople and other cities ; some were made by teams of skillful nuns . The catalogue lists the embroideries as " minor art , " yet some scenes easily match the beauty of the icons . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the " painters with the needle . " <p> For the monks , it was hardest to lend the icons and the sacred books , the organizers said . But these are the highlights of the show . <p> There is a plethora of scrolls , leaves and intact books of Gospels and hymns with ornate headings , many made by the monasteries ' own scribes . There are secular texts on medicine , botany and geography . The oldest manuscript shown is from the ninth century , a book of psalms and miniatures that ranges from saints and patriarchs to domestic animals . Scholars estimate that Mount Athos holds one-fourth of the world 's Greek manuscripts , although many still need to be properly catalogued . Without Glass , Images Impress <p> At the heart of the exhibit is a room that feels like a chapel , lined with 14th-century icons and a carved altar screen the size of the whole wall , transported here as pieces of a fragile puzzle . Visitors seemed spellbound before the large luminous images of Jesus , the Apostles and archangels . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were big discussions about protecting them , " Mrs. Gouryioti said . " The monks decided not to , because they would lose much of their strength , because in glass cases they would become art objects . " <p> These were what the Orthodox call icons for prayer , theology made visible , said Mrs. Trivella , the art historian . They followed the classic rules , Jesus with his strict frontal pose and penetrating gaze . <p> In the language of iconography each character has its own pose , gestures and attributes , rules that must be strictly followed . Earlier icons and frescoes were more realistic , Mrs. Trivella said , but gradually and deliberately they were made flatter and the figures became disembodied . The lack of perspective is not a matter of naivete , but to make the image go outward to the viewer . Purists had decided that this befitted the role of the icon , which was not to venerate the person or scene depicted but to use it for spiritual uplift , to engender meditation . Knowing Eras By the Pigment <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident here on a wall lined with work by Theophanis , a Cretan master , who painted at Athos in the 16th century . It was still evident in icons made three centuries later . Art historians say that they can recognize a period by the pigments or the clothing , but gestures and postures have remained constant . <p> Much of the work in the show was cleaned and treated in Athos workshops where conservators taught the monks . It is there that monks are still painting icons today , following the traditions . <p> On one wall in the show are words of advice from a medieval master to his pupils . " To paint flesh , " he says , " first use a coat of deep red because it is more solid and humbler than bright red . " After much other counsel , he says , " Do the least to express the most . "
