In the months since D. William Shunn sold us this story , he has moved from his native Utah  --  first to Seattle , and then to New York City . He has just finished an sf novel titled The Revivalist , and is working on a farcical , semi-autobiographical mainstream novel based on his lovelife , to be called The Normal Guy . <p> He writes that " Celestial Mechanics " is dedicated to " my pals and former colleagues ( two sets that actually intersect in places ) at Folio Corporation , and to anyone who has ever worked on my car . " <p> Neuwirthrapped loudly on the marble counter . " Hey , can we get a little service over here ? " he called , unfurling his wings in what he hoped was a threatening manner . <p> A man in white coveralls , with the name " Spike " stitched on the breast in powder-blue thread , gestured for quiet as he spoke into the telephone receiver cradled under his chin . " Listen , we 're not a towing service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do sector calls . If you can get the system in here to us , we 'll take a look at it and give you an estimate . " He rolled his eyes at Neuwirth and made a jerking-off motion with his left hand . <p> " What does he mean by that ? " asked Salahuddin , Neuwirth 's new trainee . <p> " Never mind , " Neuwirth said , kneading the bridge of his nose with one hand . The sounds of loud voices mixed with the raucous clatter of machinery poured in from the adjacent service bays , while grungy rock-and-roll squirted from a tinny loudspeaker overhead . " Good grief , I think I 'm getting one of my migraines . " <p> " Yeah , well , same to you , buddy ! " Spike shouted into the telephone receiver . " Saints be praised and all that . " He slam m ed the phone down behind the counter , then sauntered over to Neuwirth and Salahuddin . His hair was thinning and slicked back , and he could have done with a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gents ? " <p> Neuwirth shook his head , eyes closed . " We 're here to pick up the Jordanelle system , " he said with exaggerated patience . " It was supposed to be finished a hundred microns ago . " <p> " Jordanelle , Jordanelle , " Spike said , leafing through a stack of ragged three-by-five cards . " Now , lessee . " <p> " Oh , come on ! This is the third time we 've had it in ! " <p> The phone rang , and Spike held up a finger . " ' Scuse me just a minute . " <p> Neuwirth turned to Salahuddin . " I ca n't believe this , " he said , gritting his teeth . <p> " Surely it ca n't always be like this , " said Salahuddin , who was several inches shorter and several pounds heavier than his trainer , and whose wings barely cleared the top of his head . " I would have thought  --  " <p> " Well , you would have been wrong ! " Neuwirth barked , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arced through his head , and he covered his face with a penitent hand . " Oh , stars above , this noise is going to drive me out of my gourd . " <p> " All right , all right , " Spike was saying into the phone as he scribbled on a pad of sticky notes . " So the fourth planet 's moons are losing about a day on every orbit . Sounds to me like you 've got a slow gravity leak somewhere , maybe a little black hole floating around where there should n't be one , but you 'll have to bring it in to be sure . Yeah , we 'll just throw it up on the lift and run some diagnostics . Let me check our schedule here . Hmm , how about a week from this Wednesday ? How 'd that work ? " <p> An impish-looking young man with a ridiculously large pompadour hairdo wandered in through the door from the service bays , wiping his hands on a fuzzy , snow-white rag . " ' Scuse me a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " Hey , Biff , wan na take care of Mr. Neuwirth ? He 's here for the Jordanelle system . " <p> " Sure , sure , " Biff said . He poured himself a cup of coffee from a white ceramic percolator behind the counter , then strolled around to where Neuwirth and Salahuddin were waiting . " Been running tests on Jordanelle all morning . Think we 've finally pinpointed the problem . " <p> " Uh-huh , sure , " said Neuwirth with an exasperated shiver of his wings . " I 've heard that story before . " <p> Biff raised his eyebrows , looking wounded , and smoothed back his pompadour . " No , no , really . I do n't know how we could have missed it the first two times . Looks like that sun of yours has been losing power because of an imbalance in the hydrogen-helium mix . " <p> " An imbalance ? Well , of course there 's an imbalance , you  --  " <p> " Hey , hey , Pops , just cool your jets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand . " We 've got a handle on the problem , and it looks like we 'll have you out of here in another . . . oh , say , fifty microns or so . We 've just got to refit the  --  " <p> " Spare me the details , " Neuwirth said wearily . " Just make sure it works this time . " <p> Biff flashed a twisted grin . " Hey , no prob , Pops . We 're the best there are , you know . " He took a long sip of his coffee . <p> " What about the estimate you gave us earlier ? " <p> " I 'm afraid we 've had to revise both the time estimate and the bill . " He shrugged without much evidence of apology . " We 're going to have to replace the subspace regulator valve , and those do n't come cheap . Now , if you 'd just have a seat over there in the waiting area . . . " <p> Neuwirth blew out a frustrated breath . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these bloodsuckers get back to work . " <p> Salahuddin trotted after Neuwirth as they returned to the marble-tiled waiting area . " Are we really going to allow them to treat us like that , Mr. Neuwirth , sir ? We have a lot to do . There 's that comet going out of control in the Dandrite system , and  --  " <p> Neuwirth spread his wings helplessly as he seated himself in a chair upholstered in cracked white vinyl . " We really do n't have any choice , I 'm afraid . " <p> " We could take our business somewhere else , " said Salahuddin . <p> Neuwirth picked up a popular physics magazine from the end table beside him and leafed through it without much interest . " It 's like young Biff told us , " he said . " These men are the best mechanics there are . Why else do you think they ended up here ? " <p> " But  --  but how can we stand by and allow them to gouge us like this ? " <p> Neuwirth set aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So what do you propose we do , Mr. Salahuddin ? That sun needs fixing and we certainly ca n't do it ourselves . " <p> " Sue , " Salahuddin said firmly . " We can hire ourselves a lawyer , and  --  " <p> Neuwirth stared at Salahuddin in surprise , then barked out a short and bitter laugh . " Talk about gouging . " He shook his head . " You certainly have a lot to learn , my friend . " Neuwirth arched his back , stretched his wings , and picked up his magazine again , immersing himself in an article about the best ways to eradicate unwanted wormholes from planetary orbits . <p> For several minutes , the only sound was the music of Nirvana grinding out from the overhead loudspeaker . Then Salahuddin spoke again . " Mr. Neuwirth , sir . . . I have a question . " <p> Neuwirth raised his eyebrows . " Yes ? " <p> Salahuddin seemed a little hesitant . " What I am wondering is . . . well , I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven or is it hell ? " <p> Neuwirth kept his attention on the magazine . " Ah , so you 've finally decided to ask a meaningful question , " he said , robbing his aching temples . " Answer me this , my little friend . Would you still go for that M.B.A . if you could do it over again ? Eh ? " <p> There was no answer . Neuwirth had expected none . <p> <p> By D.William Shunn <p>
