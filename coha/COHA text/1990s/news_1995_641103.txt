<p> YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK , Wyo. - It 's almost summertime , and Yellowstone National Park is doomed to be loved to death yet again . <p> When the last bell of the school year rings , more than 3 million visitors will begin the trek to the nation 's oldest national park . Minivans and station wagons will be bumper-to-bumper along the Grand Loop Road . <p> Tempers will boil over as drivers jostle for spots at the Old Faithful parking lot . There 'll be grocery-store gridlock at Fishing Bridge with Cheetos-wielding shoppers queuing seven deep at the checkout stands . <p> The lemminglike frenzy of vacationers streaming into Yellowstone leaves some locals loathing summer and heading for the hills . <p> " It gets warm and you start seeing all those out-of-state license plates heading up the highway - anyone with any sense stays as far away from Yellowstone as they can , " said Ron Marr , publisher of The Fan Mountain Almanac and Trout Wrapper , a weekly newspaper published just north of Yellowstone . <p> Park critics can rattle off a menu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potholed roads . Worn-out trails . Pollution in the North Fork of the Yellowstone River . One-third of the park 's 2.2 million acres still recovering from the wildfires of 1988 . Urban-style crimes including assaults , burglaries and petty thefts in campgrounds . <p> But the lure of Yellowstone remains overpowering , a childhood rite of passage that many baby boomers are re-experiencing with their own children . <p> The cascading waterfalls . Technicolor limestone formations . Boiling sulfur springs and bubbling mud pots . Two hundred geysers . Lush pine forests . Elk , moose , bears - and beginning this year , wolves - roaming the valleys and mountainsides . The wood-beam expanse of the lobby at the Old Faithful Inn . <p> Enjoying your trip to Yellowstone is easy with a little planning before hitting the park entrance . <p> " You 'd be surprised how many people just head on up here on a whim , driving into Yellowstone at dusk , and are shocked to find traffic and crowds and no place to stay for miles around , " said Bill Swift , a National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to make a trip to Yellowstone a happy memory instead of a trip from hell : <p> 1 . Watch the calendar and the clock . Winter comes early and stays late in Yellowstone . Most of the park 's roads do n't open until April 30 , and they close Nov. 1 . From Memorial Day to Labor Day the park is constantly packed . <p> To get the most out of the park but beat the crowds , visit in May , September or October , when most facilities are open but the summer crush is yet to come or already gone . <p> During peak season , you 'll run into smaller crowds by visiting Monday , Tuesday or Wednesday , the least-busy days in the park . When in the park , tour popular sites early in the morning or late in the afternoon , before and after the peak crowds . <p> 2 . Book hotels early . Yellowstone 's nine hotels and motels are nearly always booked solid in summer . Rooms at the Old Faithful Inn , the park 's famous hotel built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance . Rooms also are scarce at Lake Yellowstone Hotel , the park 's other grand lodge . You can book up to a year in advance for hotel space . Do it now . Hotels in West Yellowstone , Jackson Hole , Cody , Wyo. , and other areas outside the park often are booked weeks in advance , especially on weekends . <p> 3 . The early bird gets the campsite . Ten of Yellowstone 's 12 campgrounds are available on a first-come , first-served basis . During summer , all usually are full by noon . Sleeping in your car in unauthorized areas will earn you a fine and an order to move on . The best bet is to stay overnight outside the park , then hurry in first thing in the morning and get a campsite . Reservations are accepted up to eight weeks in advance at the Bridge Bay campground and Fishing Bridge RV Park . <p> 4 . Stay at Grand Teton park . Just a half-hour south of Yellowstone is one of the most dramatic natural landscapes in the United States . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make the park a popular destination even if they were n't in Yellowstone 's backyard . <p> Accommodations range from the plush Jenny Lake Lodge to the rustic bungalows at Colter Bay Village . The best rooms are second-floor mountain-view rooms at the Jackson Lake Lodge . Grosvent Campground , at the far southern end of the park , is a good bet for late arrivals - it 's the last of the spots in the two national parks to fill up . <p> 5 . Skip West Yellowstone . The tourist crush in Yellowstone is centered around the tacky tourist town of West Yellowstone and the Grand Central Station atmosphere of Old Faithful Geyser . <p> West Yellowstone embodies just about everything that is wrong with the national park experience today . Just outside the park 's west gate , it 's a collection of motels , bars , restaurants , condominiums and tacky shops and attractions . Big crowds fill the Grizzly Discovery Center and the IMAX theater to see captive bears and huge motion pictures of what the park used to be like . Skip it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stay off the loop . If Yellowstone has 2.2 million acres , why does it seem that the park is constantly in the throes of gridlock ? Because most visitors spend the bulk of their trip to Yellowstone driving the 142-mile Grand Loop Road . It 's hard to completely avoid , since the loop features Old Faithful , Inspiration Point , Grand Canyon and many other must-sees . But get off the road by midday or resign yourself to a wilderness traffic jam . <p> 7 . Head east . To break away from the pack , aim east to Yellowstone 's less-visited spots . While the crowds elbow each other at the Fountain Paint Pot or jostle for parking spaces at West Thumb , you can enjoy the relative emptiness of Steamboat Point , Slough Creek and Eleanor Lake . Try staying at Roosevelt Lodge , the least packed of the park 's motels . Picnic under Avalanche Peak or Pebble Creek . Go even farther afield and enjoy a few nights at the Shoshone Lodge , 7 miles east of the east park entrance on U.S. 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log cabins , wandering moose and even an occasional brown bear rummaging around the trash bins . <p> 8 . Take in two cities . Make Yellowstone or Grand Teton your target for day trips and stay instead in one of two wonderful Western towns just outside the parks ' boundaries . <p> Jackson Hole , Wyo. , has transformed over the past 20 years from sleepy village to summer playground of the Forbes 400 . Just outside Grand Teton 's boundary and only 45 minutes from Yellowstone , its motor inns and chalet-style hotels are a comfortable alternative to the jam-packed park lodgings . The tiny downtown is still a fun place to stroll , with the city square rimmed with old deer antlers and shops featuring tasseled leather Western wear and cowhide-covered furniture . Head for the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar , where drinkers sit on stools with horse saddles at knotty-pine bars inlaid with hundreds of silver dollars . <p> Cody , Wyo. , has even more Western flavor , centered around the Irma Hotel built in 1902 by Buffalo Bill Cody . Stop in for a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turn-of-the-century dining room . From June through August , there are rodeos almost every night . Cody also is a great jumping-off point for white-water rafting , dude ranches and hikes in the Shoshone National Forest . It 's 85 miles through beautiful forests to the east entrance of Yellowstone . <p> 9 . Watch out for wildlife . Until 1969 , bears accounted for an average of 48 injuries in the parks each year . By the mid-1970s , the roadside-beggar bears were herded to more remote areas and feeding bears from automobiles was banned . But wildlife still can be dangerous - never approach wildlife , especially animals in the presence of their young . Getting between a bear , moose or 2,000-pound bison and its baby is a sure bet to upset mama . <p> 10 . Pack your patience . Realize before you come to Yellowstone that it 's among the most popular places to visit in the world . There are going to be crowds and lines and frustrations . Give yourself plenty of time and do n't try to see the park all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Grand Teton , " said Swift , the parks spokesman .
