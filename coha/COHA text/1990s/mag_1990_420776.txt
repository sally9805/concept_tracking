An expert 's introduction to these colorful houseplants <p> QUESTION : Can a plant with a name that sounds like a disease ever make it as a houseplant ? Answer : Yes ! The streptocarpus , its name notwithstanding , is becoming more and more popular as an indoor plant . In fact , you can find streptocarpus at almost any nursery , and possibly even at your local supermarket or department store . <p> In spite of this plant 's daunting botanical name , its common name , Cape primrose , has never really caught on . For those who find it easier to accept a difficult name if it has some meaning , just remember that streptocarpus comes from the Greek words streptos , meaning " twisted , " and karpos , meaning " fruit "  --  a perfect description of the plants ' twisted seedpods . <p> Streptocarpus belongs to the gesneriad family ( Gesneriaceae ) , which includes African violets , episcias , gloxinias , and columneas . Although it is generally accepted that the modern hybrid streptocarpus traces its origin back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , in 1818 , nearly 50 compatible species have been used at one time or another in crosses , so the " official " name of the modern streptocarpus is Streptocarpus xhybridus . Modern hybrids are similar to S. rexii in basic form but offer a far wider range of colors . One species that was also important in the development of S. xhybridus was S. dunnii , whose brick-red to pale-pink flowers introduced a new part of the spectrum to the basic blues , purples , and whites of previous hybrids . ( Flowers in shades of yellow and orange  --  the only colors missing until now  --  may not be far off . ) Today 's hybrids are recurrent bloomers with long , thick leaves that arch over the edge of the pot . Some plants bear stems with numerous , smaller flowers ; others bear only two or three large flowers per stem . <p> Although the rosettelike leaves of most streptocarpuses appear similar to those of many other plants , their actual growth pattern is curious . There is no central stem , and each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , these leaves actually flower . A close look at any streptocarpus leaf will reveal that flower buds and stalks form at its base . Each leaf grows , produces several flower stalks at its base , then withers away , leaving room for future generations of one-leaved flowering plants . Culture <p> Streptocarpuses are easy to grow and will flower well anywhere other flowering houseplants thrive . They do , however , have an annoying tendency to suddenly give up the ghost after half a year or so of growth and bloom . This is due partly to the annual nature of some of the species involved in the modern hybrids . But it is also due to the fact that these plants dislike excessive heat . <p> It may seem surprising that a South African plant should be heat sensitive , but most streptocarpus species are found in kloofs , mountain ravines that face seaward , where the cold ocean currents moderate the climate . The plants therefore enjoy comparatively cool temperatures during their growing season . The plants ' aversion to heat has been greatly reduced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , there are options besides rushing out and buying an air conditioner . <p> For example , try moving your plant to a north window , or even to a basement window , for the summer . The sun is so strong at that time of the year that the plant will still get plenty of light . Another simple yet little-known technique is double-potting . Plant your streptocarpus in a clay pot , then place the clay pot in a larger container and fill the space between the two pots with moist sphagnum moss . As the extra humidity in the moss evaporates , the temperature drops and the plant 's roots are kept cool . As with many plants , soil temperature is far more important than air temperature . <p> You can also plant your streptocarpus outside for the summer in a semishady spot ; anywhere impatiens will grow is fine . Although air temperatures outdoors may reach stifling levels , soil has an insulating effect and keeps root temperatures down . I have been impressed by how wonderful streptocarpuses look in my USDA Zone 4 garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summers . They actually bloom better there than indoors , although slugs and snails can be a problem . Streptocarpuses are not at all winter hardy ; if you want to save any you will have to divide the clumps in the fall and bring in a section or two . <p> Until recently , hybridizing programs for streptocarpuses were centered in Europe , where cooler home temperatures are the norm , and no effort was put into developing heat-tolerant strains . The more recent hybrids , however , have been developed in North America , and heat tolerance has become a priority . The result is that many of the most recent releases are far less susceptible to heat than previous hybrids . Some of these will weather the most blistering summers with no special care . <p> Streptocarpuses are quite adaptable as far as their light needs are concerned . Although they require a bit more light than , say , the African violet , they will bloom well with less light than many other flowering houseplants . Ideally , give them a sunny window in winter ( full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and a bright cool window with little direct sun in summer . An east window is an excellent choice at any time of year . Streptocarpuses also do well under fluorescent lights , making a great deal of vegetative growth , although I do find I get more abundant flowering in natural light . <p> Streptocarpuses have a certain amount of built-in drought tolerance and will recover even when their leaves have gone limp from lack of water . It 's best not to let them go to that extreme , however , Water them whenever their soil feels dry to the touch . During heat waves , when the plants are already under stress , keep them a bit on the dry side  --  they 'll come through much better than if kept moist . <p> Although streptocarpuses have the reputation of not needing much fertilizer , I find they do best with a " constant feed " method . Adding a diluted fertilizer ( 1/4 teaspoon per gallon of tepid water ) such as 5-10-5 to each watering will keep them in top shape and stimulate blooming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade ago , which contain a higher proportion of perlite or vermiculite , are ideal for these plants . My only suggestion is to add some limestone chips ( two tablespoons per quart ) to the mix , since streptocarpuses , true to their South African origins , prefer a less acid soil than many other houseplants . A soil pH of 6.5 to 7.0 is perfect . <p> Streptocarpuses are probably more tolerant of dry indoor air than most other houseplants . To keep your plants vigorous , however , use a humidity tray or humidifier during the winter . <p> The only major insect pest of the streptocarpus is the mealybug , which loves to hide under its leaves . Mealybugs look like tiny balls of cotton and appear most often at the base of the leaf . By the time you notice them , however , the underside of the leaf may already be severely infested . Make sure you isolate any new purchases to prevent mealybugs from getting into your collection . If any do show up , treat the infected plants immediately with an insecticidal soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may need to repeat the treatment weekly for a month or longer before they finally disappear . If the plant is severely infested , you 'll find it more effective to turn the plant upside down and plunge its leaves into a solution of insecticidal soap rather than trying to reach each individual insect with a spray . You can also take leaf cuttings of badly infested plants and treat them with insecticidal soap before rooting them . Propagation <p> The easiest way to propagate your streptocarpus is by division . You can do this any time of the year . Simply unpot the pant and pull or cut it apart into clumps , each with several leaves . When repotting , cover the roots well , but to prevent fungus infections , leave any wounds exposed to open air for a few days before filling up the pot entirely . <p> Leaves can also be rooted , either whole or in sections . A young leaf can simply be broken off at its base and inserted in the rooting medium with its base just under the surface , much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of rooting leaf sections . The first is to cut the leaf along its width into one-inch sections , angling the cut toward the base of the leaf so that it is wedge-shaped . You then insert the pointed end into the rooting medium . The other method is to cut the leaf lengthwise , remove the midrib , then place each half , cut side down , in the rooting medium . If the leaf is too long to fit lengthwise into the pot , you may need to roll the leaf slightly so it circles around the pot 's inner rim . Cover the leaf sections with transparent plastic to keep the humidity high . Both of these methods will result in a large number of young plants , often 50 or so . <p> Because streptocarpus cuttings are subject to rot , I recommend using perlite as a rooting medium . It does n't remain as moist as vermiculite or artificial potting mixes , two other popular rooting mixtures , so there is less chance of infection . Also , just barely cover the cut surface with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rot . <p> Streptocarpuses are also surprisingly easy to grow from seed ; in fact , some hybrids are most readily available that way . Simply sow the dustlike seed on the surface of a moist , sterile planting medium and cover the container with clear plastic . It is important to expose the container to light ; otherwise the seeds will not germinate . Tiny seedlings will appear in one to four weeks and can be potted up into individual pots when they reach about one and a half inches . Streptocarpuses are unusual in that one of the seed-leaves ( cotyledons ) becomes a true leaf . Occasionally , both cotyledons develop ; the resulting plants are reputed to be especially floriferous , so you might want to give them special attention . Streptocarpuses reach flowering size very rapidly , usually within seven or eight months of germination . Other Recommendations <p> Streptocarpus growers often become concerned because the leaf tips of their plants turn brown . This is in fact nothing to worry about . Unlike the leaves of other plants , which mature and then stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life span . That means the tip of the leaf is much older than its base and will begin to show signs of wear and tear while the base is still young and strong . In the wild , the leaves simply begin to dry up from the tip backwards , which does n't harm the plant in the slightest . Although this tendency can be discouraging , it may be a consolation to know that trimming the leaf tips back to as natural a shape as possible is considered a perfectly acceptable practice , even for show plants . You can keep leaf-tip browning to a minimum by giving the plant moderate temperatures , adequate but not excessive moisture , and good light throughout the year . <p> Once a leaf has flowered and there are no more flower buds at its base , it should be removed . It no longer contributes anything to the plant ( which is , you recall , actually made up of individual rooted leaves ) . Another beauty secret is to remove each flower stalk when the last blossom fades . Be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it you may break off the entire leaf . <p> For sources of plants mentioned in this article , see page 64 . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Left : The bizarre unifoliate ( single-leaved ) Streptocarpus dunnii has contributed its red coloration to a host of modern hybrids . Opposite : Streptocarpus Constant Nymph ' , developed in the 1940s , was one of the first hybrids to win over houseplant growers through its compact stature and attractive , regularly produced flowers . <p> By Larry Hodgson <p> <p> Larry Hodgson 's article " Houseplant Futures " appeared in the December 1989 issue of this magazine . <p> VARIETIES TO LOOK FOR <p> A wide variety of hybrid streptocarpuses are available , but they are rarely identified other than by color . Some nurseries , however , do carry a good selection of named cultivars , and new seed strains and cultivars become available each year . Here are a few of the varieties you may find . <p> Wiesmoor ' hybrids First released in the early 1950s , these large-flowered , large-leaved plants bloom seasonally and are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed . <p> Nymph ' series A European series that first became popular in North America in the early 1970s , although the first plant in this group , Constant Nymph ' , dates back to 1946 . Although they are smaller-flowered and less flamboyant than the Wiesmoor ' series , they are better bloomers . Constant Nymph ' ( violet-blue with darker veining ) and Maasen 's White ' ( the finest pure-white streptocarpus ) are commonly available . <p> Bavarian Belle ' series Very similar to the Nymph ' series . <p> John Innes ' series Plants in this series , all of which bear women 's names ( Fiona ' , Tina ' , Helen ' , etc. ) , have numerous but much smaller flowers than earlier hybrids . They have largely been replaced by the new Olympus ' series . <p> Olympus ' series Smaller plants with good heat resistance and numerous small flowers year-round . Cultivars include Ariadne ' ( white with carmine streaks ) , Achilles ' ( dark red ) , Meese ' ( pink ) , Orion ' ( light blue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Ulysses ' ( rich purple ) . <p> Holiday ' hybrid series A new line from Park Seed . Those in this group are among the best streptocarpuses that can currently be grown from seed . Although larger than plants in the Olympus ' strain , they are equally heat tolerant . Three colors are available  --  pink , blue , and white  --  all with darker veining . <p> The hybrids Electra ' ( red flowers ) and Essue ' ( deep-blue flowers with darker lines ) regularly garner top awards at plant shows . My personal law ) rite , however , is Black Panther ' , which has deep velvety purple flowers  --  even darker than so-called black tulips  --  and two bright yellow " eyes . " <p> A number of species streptocarpus also deserve attention . Although plants are rarely available , the seed banks of plant societies usually offer a wide choice . Streptocarpus rexii is an attractive plant with white , bluish , or mauve flowers heavily netted with purple on the lower lobes . It blooms well throughout much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varying from white to violet with darker lines . Other similar species are S. primuliformis and S. polyanthus . <p> Whereas most of the commonly available hybrids derive from the best-known section of the genus , Streptocarpus subgenus Streptocarpus , the subgenus Streptocarpella contains vastly different plants that are usually referred to as streptocarpellas . These plants produce stems with opposite or whorled leaves and numerous small flowers from the leaf axils . Although most have an upright habit of growth , the stems are weak , and so the plants make ideal subjects for hanging baskets . The hybrid Concord Blue ' , with blue-violet flowers , is particularly choice . <p> Some of the single-leaf ( unifoliate ) streptocarpuses are also worth growing , if only as curiosities . This group includes both miniatures such as Streptocarpus rimicola and giants such as S. dunnii , whose single leaf can reach three feet in length . After unifoliate streptocarpuses germinate , one of the two seed-leaves continues to develop instead of dropping off , as with other plants . Eventually it becomes a full-grown leaf , the only one the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are annuals or biennials and have to be started again from seed after they flower . <p> By Larry Hodgson <p>
