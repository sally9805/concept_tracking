<p> An attempt has been made to raise the dead in the Maryland attorney general 's race . <p> Republican challenger Richard D. Bennett issued a news release last week saying incumbent Democrat J. Joseph Curran Jr . ' s approval of a liberalized " good time " formula for state prisoners led to the early release of convicted rapist John F. Thanos just months before he went on a 1990 crime spree in which he killed three teenagers . When Thanos was put to death for the murders in May , he was the first prisoner executed in Maryland since 1961 . <p> But officials in Curran 's office said Bennett is mistaken . The new formula for deducting " good time " from prisoners ' jail terms did not apply to Thanos , said Stuart M. Nathan , an assistant attorney general assigned to the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services . <p> The formula , approved by Curran in March 1990 , applied only to prisoners serving overlapping concurrent sentences , Nathan said . Thanos did not fall in that somewhat narrow category when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Bennett , who has said he opposes " good time " credits for violent offenders , questioned Nathan 's statement . " Just remember , he 's on Joe Curran 's payroll , " said Bennett campaign director Dick Leggett . " He 's paid to say these things . " <p> Thanos was sentenced in 1969 on a rape conviction and released in April 1986 after the completion of that sentence . A month later , he was sentenced for robbery . Because the rape sentence already had been completed , it did not overlap with the robbery sentence , Nathan said . That meant the new " good time " formula did not apply to him when he was released for the robbery in 1990 . <p> Just to complicate matters , Thanos was released 18 months prematurely in 1990 , not because of the new formula , but because of an incorrect " good time " calculation by a prison clerk . The clerk was later fired . <p> Speaking of and for the Candidates <p> Carol Hirschburg and David Seldin are never at a loss for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are the chief mouthpieces for Maryland gubernatorial candidates Ellen R. Sauerbrey and Parris N. Glendening , respectively . <p> On a moment 's notice , and sometimes less , they are ready with a quip or a retort , a handy skill as the campaign heads into its frantic last days before the Nov. 8 general election . <p> The words of these unelected  --  actually , unnominated  --  individuals often find their way into press accounts of the campaign to succeed Gov . William Donald Schaefer . If Republican Sauerbrey and Democrat Glendening are coming from different directions , so are Hirschburg and Seldin . <p> Hirschburg , 48 , was Sauerbrey 's fund-raising director in the primary and moved over to handle press duties for the general election . <p> A native of Dayton , Ohio , she came to Annapolis to work for the General Assembly in 1970 after receiving a political science degree from Ohio University . <p> She has done political consulting for Republican candidates in Pennsylvania and Maryland , including the Reagan-Bush Maryland campaign in 1984 . She also ran two of Rep. Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell to Sauerbrey in the Sept. 13 GOP primary for governor . Did Hirschburg have special insights to help Sauerbrey ? <p> " I think it was a benefit , because I know her so well , " Hirschburg said . Then she added , diplomatically : " You pick the best candidate for each particular race . At the time I worked for Helen , I thought she was the best candidate for Congress . " <p> Seldin , 26 , came to the Glendening campaign as press secretary in February , leaving a job as a press aide at the White House . <p> Seldin grew up in Pleasantville , N.Y. , and went to work for the Democratic Leadership Council in Washington after graduating in 1989 with a philosophy degree from Colgate University . <p> Seldin spent a year working on Capitol Hill and then joined the Clinton campaign as a field organizer , laboring in New Hampshire , Michigan , Maine , Maryland , New York and New Jersey . During the general election , he worked in the Little Rock campaign press office . <p> Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Clinton would have won New Hampshire " if you subtract the area I was in charge of . " His area happened to be the one closest to the Massachusetts home of the primary victor , former senator Paul E. Tsongas . <p> Seldin spent a year as an aide in the White House press office before jumping to the Glendening campaign as press secretary . <p> " I wanted to get back into campaign work , and Parris was just the kind of substantive , forward-looking candidate I was looking for , " he said . <p> The candidate could n't have said it better himself . But that 's the point to being a press secretary . <p> Mills Sure Is Acting Estranged <p> Throughout her 20-year political career , Prince George 's County Council member Sue V. Mills ( D ) has fancied herself somewhat of a renegade . <p> Last week , Mills endorsed Republican Ellen R. Sauerbrey , a state delegate from Baltimore County , in the governor 's race , instead of Democrat Parris N. Glendening , the Prince George 's county executive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice in Clinton , during a charity auction to benefit a Prince George 's Board of Trade scholarship fund . <p> The news was not well received by Democratic Party leaders . Gerard Evans , the county 's Democratic chairman , said Mills has not responded to attempts by party leaders to reach out to her since her loss in the Democratic primary for county executive . <p> Mills finished third in the primary , behind lawyer Wayne K. Curry and state Sen. Beatrice P. Tignor ( D-Prince George 's ) , and did not attend a recent Curry-initiated unity breakfast for the county 's Democratic leaders on the county , state and federal levels . <p> " It 's sour grapes , and she ought to be ashamed of herself , " Evans said . " We 're trying to elect for the first time in this century a governor from Prince George 's County . And we 're going to win this thing with or without Sue Mills . " <p> Cross Democrat Crosses Party Lines <p> Weeks after losing a brutal primary battle , Democratic state Sen. Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican rival . <p> Yeager said that Virginia M. Thomas , who received more than twice as many votes as he did in the District 13 Senate primary , " lacks professional integrity " and consistently changes her votes on the House floor . <p> Yeager appeared at a press conference this week announcing the endorsement of Del . Martin G. Madden ( R-Howard ) with state environmental activists , who have given high marks to Thomas in the past but said they now favor her opponent . <p> Both Madden and Thomas have earned top grades from the state 's League of Conservation Voters for floor votes in the last three years . Thomas received scores of 100 , 100 and 90 , and Madden registered 100 , 100 and 100 . <p> But Thomas has come under fire for voting one way in committee and another on the floor of the House . In one case , she changed her vote on a measure limiting liability for oil spills in the Chesapeake Bay . <p> Madden said these " flip-flops " were critical because the committee votes are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed on the House floor , anyway . <p> Thomas , vice chairwoman of the House Environmental Matters Committee , said Yeager 's endorsement is " sour grapes " and that the criticism of environmental activists was based on a " personality conflict " rather than on her record . She also said Madden had not been an effective legislator . <p> Thomas argued that she has steered significant environmental laws through the House , including bills on composting , recycling and alternative fuels . <p> " Madden does n't have much of a record , so he 's trying to throw mud at me , " Thomas said . <p> Of Crime Prevention and Politics <p> In Prince George 's , where the murder rate is second only to that of the District in this region , both candidates for county executive have identified stronger crime-fighting as a main goal . But they split last week over technique . <p> Republican nominee Robert B. Ostrom announced that he was assembling a task force of experts to offer suggestions on how to better use public safety money . <p> The group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will examine such issues as reducing the number of officers in administrative positions and creating a central booking facility to cut down the amount of time officers spend booking prisoners . Ostrom said the task force is not expected to produce recommendations until after the Nov. 8 general election . <p> County police officials said the department has researched the merits of centralized booking for several years and plans to open a test facility in Hyattsville by July . A larger facility to handle all of the county prisoners is planned within two years , in Upper Marlboro near the county jail . <p> During the race for county executive , Ostrom 's Democratic opponent , lawyer Wayne K. Curry , has tried to position himself as the candidate most concerned about crime . In August , he pledged to add 200 officers to the police force and to stiffen penalties for crimes against the elderly . <p> Curry estimated that the additional officers would cost $ 10 million and he would find the money by trimming other , unspecified programs . The Democratic candidate also pledged to establish a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cope with domestic violence . <p> " Everything that Mr. Curry suggests is going to cost us money or is going to be some feel-good change that I do n't think gets to the heart of fighting crime , " Ostrom said . <p> Curry challenged Ostrom 's assessment . Before making his recommendations , Curry said , he sought out community leaders and law enforcement officials throughout the county . <p> " Our proposals have been thoroughly researched and have tremendous support in the Prince George 's County electorate , " Curry said . " It 's scarcely a feel-good program , and it 's certainly substantial . " Staff writers Robert Pierre and Anna Borgman contributed to this report .
