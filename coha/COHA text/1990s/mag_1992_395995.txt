At the end of Lower Shannon Branch , a dirt road that winds for six miles through West Virginia 's hill country , there sits a vast , bowl-shaped hollow , its sides carpeted with 6,000 acres of second-growth hardwood trees . This particular piece of land holds little attraction for most people in rural McDowell County . It 's not especially scenic  --  it looks like a thousand other wooded hollows in southern Appalachia that were first timbered and then mined . But the valley 's ordinariness and resolute quiet belie a brewing national storm . Like many out-of-the-way sites in poor , rural communities across America , this hollow is considered by some an ideal place to dump the disposable diapers , orange rinds , Coca-Cola bottles , and chicken bones of several million people who live very far away . The scarred hillsides of this valley provide a good vantage point from which to view the nation 's garbage wars . For here , two shaky vectors have converged  --  a community in acute financial distress and a corporation looking to build a landfill that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises to become increasingly common as the nation 's trash piles mount , municipal landfills are ordered shut , and waste-management companies propose megadumps in those pockets of the country most desperate for cash and the promise of a financially stable future . I went to McDowell last fall because , in agreeing to become home to one of the largest dumps in the country , it represented the future of garbage in America . This was no abstract notion for me : as a New Yorker , I 'm part of a community that 's gobbling up and fill space faster than any viable alternatives for disposing of our trash can be found . New York City 's last local dump will close within the decade , and the city already ships trash , by truck and by train , to places well beyond the Hudson River . If my garbage was going to be traveling far away , I was curious to trace its complex route  --  a route that promised to land it in McDowell County . Welch , the county seat of McDowell , is a coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most productive coalfield in the country . During its heyday , in the Forties and Fifties , McDowell County produced 21 million tons of coal a year . Welch boasted three movie houses , three hospitals , and no fewer than forty-two beer joints . Its frontier spirit even inspired such cosmopolitan accoutrements as houses of prostitution and gambling . The reins of power in McDowell County were firmly held by the coal conglomerates ; King Coal rented houses to its workers , and furnished them with heat , water , and electricity . It provided a company store , doctors , and schools . But in the early Eighties , the bottom fell out of the coal market , and increased mechanization within the industry sharply reduced the number of workers needed to mine those few veins that still produced . Like a colony that exists only to feed a remote power , McDowell suffered when the coal empire collapsed : the big companies pulled out , taking with them most of the county 's mineral wealth , natural gas , and timber . They left behind an epidemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legacy of resentment toward those who own what is left of the region 's wealth . Welch is no longer a sophisticated place . It 's the sort of town where people go on the radio to swap guns , where the arrival of a Long John Silver 's restaurant is much anticipated . Nearly a third of the stores on McDowell Street stand dusty and closed ; the Greyhound no longer pulls into the depot across from City Hall . There are no movie theaters or bookstores left to enliven the hours after work . ln fact , there 's precious little work to be had . Figures vary , but Tony Johnson , publisher of the ten-page Welch Daily News , puts the county 's unemployment rate at about 60 percent . Though McDowell County has always referred to itself , somewhat defensively , as the Free State of McDowell , the region in many ways has come to resemble a dependent Third World nation . More than a quarter of McDowell 's 35,000 people live in poverty ; thanks to poor diet and heavy smoking , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart attacks . In 1989 the county 's infant mortality rate was a third above the national average . And one in ten residents receives disability payments for black lung disease . As one unemployed McDowell man told me , " If it were n't for black lung and Social Security , there 'd be nothing here . " The people 's despair can be measured most starkly in suicide attempts , of which the hospital reports no fewer than two a week . McDowell 's future is bleak : the county lacks the basic infrastructure that might convince a company to choose it as the site for a new factory or branch plant . Thanks in part to its terrain , which is fractured by countless streams and mountain ridges , McDowell does n't have a single four-lane highway ; within its borders , it takes an hour and a half to drive fifty miles . Welch 's mayor , Martha Moore , has been forced to lay off the town 's meter maids and the entire fire department , and to cancel city workers ' pension plans . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vendors and can barely meet its bare-bones payroll , recently laid off several sheriff 's deputies . The rare projects that are offered to McDowell are the ones that have already been turned away by people who can afford to say no . Within the last five years the county 's economic salvation has loomed first in the form of a federal prison , to be built atop a strip mine ; then it was going to be a facility for holding spent nuclear fuel rods . Neither scheme panned out , to the relief of many , but still McDowell kept looking for a way to stop , or at least stall , its precipitous decline . In 1987 that search ended ; a new means of salvation had appeared . This time it was garbage . Garbage is a simple matter : people make it , then they want it to go away . They pay to have it picked up from their curbs ; their communities pay to tip it into dumps or to truck it somewhere else , preferably somewhere far away , beyond their borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount we discard keeps growing : by the year 2000 , according to the Environmental Protection Agency 's estimates , we 'll be producing five pounds of garbage per person per day , more than double the output of thirty years ago . Most of this garbage  --  about 80 percent of it  --  ends up in the ground , buried in landfills . But by the mid-1990s , one half of the 6,500 municipal landfills still operating in the United States are expected to reach capacity ( since 1978 , 14,000 landfills have closed ) . Already the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island , the nation 's largest city dump , turns away 10,000 of the 27,000 tons New York City generates each day . When it peaks at 505 feet , within the decade , Fresh Kills will be almost as tall as the Washington Monument . EPA requirements introduced last September will force still more landfills to close : the new rules mandate that over the next six years landfill operators will have to shut down every dump that lacks the high-tech monitoring systems and liners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features carry a big price tag , and so , for most small communities , up-to-snuff dumps have become prohibitively expensive . Nationally , the solution would appear to be fewer but larger landfills ; in relative terms , giant dumps are cheaper to build than small ones . To these strategically placed , privately run sites will be trucked , or hauled by rail , garbage from surrounding regions , even from out of state . Ironically , the EPA 's ruling , which ought to have offered some environmental relief to communities concerned about landfill safety , instead introduced the prospect of a Faustian bargain , in which huge waste-hauling companies offer to alleviate the economic woes of desperate communities  --  in exchange for a place to put a megadump . It was just such a deal that was presented to McDowell County in 1987 by a Pennsylvania businessman named Jack Fugett . Fugett , a personable urbanite who affects a folksy manner as soon as he turns off 1-77 into McDowell County , is the president of Capels Resources , a subsidiary of the Berwind Corporation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McDowell : Berwind owns the mineral rights under almost a third of the surface land in the county . Fugett wanted to build a huge landfill in Welch , one that would accept 300,000 tons of out-of-state waste a month . The garbage would arrive by rail , filling an estimated 182 cars a day . When Martha Moore became mayor in 1986 , she stepped into a quagmire . In addition to its crushing fiscal troubles , Welch was under court order to clean up its water : the city has no sewage-treatment system , and the fecal coliform levels in its rivers were as much as 50,000 times higher than the EPA 's recommended limits . The cost of feasibility studies for a treatment system had already eaten up what little funding the town had for installing it . And though it seemed the least of her woes , Moore also had garbage troubles : in 1987 , under pressure from the state , McDowell agreed to close its only landfill , a low-tech dump down the road in Marytown . In this respect , McDowell is like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they can no longer use their landfill . But unlike most of these towns , Welch has plenty of places to put its trash : residents have no qualms about using one of the county 's many undeveloped hollows to bury the 1,100 tons of garbage they produce each month . As a rule , Welch does not recycle . Its roadsides are littered with paper bags from the town 's half-dozen fastfood outlets . One survey found 180 illegal dump sites around the county . Although McDowell Countians did n't mind keeping their trash nearby , they certainly did n't want to pay higher sanitation fees to do so . But after the county began poking around , looking for a suitable site for a new landfill , they discovered they could n't afford one . Thanks to the new EPA rules , landfills now cost upward of $10 million to construct . The search for a replacement landfill for McDowell was led by Charlie Thomas , a retired auto-body mechanic who , at the time , sat on the county 's solid-waste board . When Thomas learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Lower Shannon Branch  --  was owned by Berwind , he contacted Jack Fugett . But Fugett turned the tables on Thomas , suggesting a much larger project . Thomas was skeptical at first , but Fugett kept talking . The landfill would have a " state of the art " liner  --  a complicated layering scheme of dirt , clay , plastic liners , and gravel  --  and sixty wells for testing water quality . The electronic monitoring and transfer stations would be fully enclosed . In addition to local inspections , the EPA , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration , and the state Department of Natural Resources would have their pokes at it , too . The seven families that lived on Lower Shannon Branch , who rented their houses from Capels , would be compensated and relocated . When the dump was full , in fifty years , it would be a flat , grassy field , the kind of place a factory might want to locate , Fugett said . Thomas began to come around . " Nothing like this had ever been done before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a tourist attraction . " Charlie Thomas introduced Fugett to Mayor Moore just as the county 's woes were coming to a head . They had nowhere to dump their trash and no money to pay their bills , and if the mayor did n't clean up the sewage mess soon , she would be going to jail for defying the court order . " Something clicked in my mind when I heard about ( Fugett 's ) plan , " she remembers . " I thought , let 's take two negatives  --  sewage and garbage  --  and turn them into a positive . It was a natural . " Moore knew that fifteen similar super-landfills had been proposed and shot down in other West Virginia counties , but those counties , she reasoned , did n't have McDowell 's problems . The mayor knew a good deal when it came along . Jack Fugett , she decided , would treat Welch 's sewage , deal with its garbage , and pay for the privilege . The idea was not outlandish . Nationwide , Moore knew , money swirls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with industry analysts predicting a doubling of revenues within the next five years . County officials did some research . They learned that for agreeing to accept a landfill , operators pay towns " host fees " based on tonnage received . The fees range widely , reflecting each town 's negotiation skills . Although the waste companies are prepared to pay as much as ten dollars a ton , they often get away with per-ton fees as low as twenty-five cents . As part of the deal , a host community pays nothing to dump ; operators make their money charging the neighboring towns and distant cities whose garbage ends up in the landfill . Waste haulers may also sweeten deals with such tokens of appreciation as community centers and scholarships . Fugett 's sales pitch to McDowell County got a boost from the fact that a similar landfill had just gone up in nearby Charles City County , Virginia . Before the landfill was built , that county had had no supermarket , no drugstore , not even a bank . But since the facility began accepting its allotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut property taxes and begun building new schools . Dee Milom , a broad-shouldered Welch resident with graying hair and piercing blue eyes , happened to visit the Charles City landfill last year and found it a model enterprise . " It did n't smell , " he told me later . " It did n't look like anything . Nobody paid it any mind . " An out-of-work carpenter , Milom was hoping to get a job at the Capels landfill ; on one of his regular sweeps through town last summer , Fugett had promised to hire him . Fugett had shown him intricate drawings of the landfill 's liner , and Milom believed Fugett when he said that it would n't leak . And even if it was n't fail-safe , that was a risk Milom was willing to take . " You got ta get pollution to get jobs , " he said , his voice hard . " We 're gon na die anyhow . We 'll starve to death . " Chip Lawson , a jeweler on Welch 's main street who 's seen business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I visited his store one morning , the only customers he had were asking him to appraise pieces they wanted to sell . " I 'd rather be the garbage capital of the world than the welfare capital of the world , " he said . " I 'm for anything that will bring jobs . This is one of the last businesses we can have here . " When asked if he worried about environmental degradation , he answered , " Will the landfill be any worse than our open sewer ? " Obviously , he thought not . And if it contained toxics , would he still be for it ? " Yes . They have monitors . " What about nuclear waste ? " Sure , " he answered , smiling . " Then we 'd get highways . " Throughout 1988 Fugett met once a month with Thomas and other county officials . They talked about trash , about liners and sewage , tipping fees and revenue . The McDowell representatives liked what they heard , but they pushed for more . They knew that landfill owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitable . Gross profits run upward of 50% of revenue at large dumps ( one Texas company had profits of $24 million on revenue of $39 million last year ) . And because landfills are built in small sections , with revenue coming in as each section fills , the costs of construction are spread out as the money rolls in . In Mobile , Arizona , for example , Waste Management Inc. is spending a total of $240 million on a dump that it projects will bring in $2.26 billion over its fifty-year lifespan . In the windowless meeting room of McDowell 's county commission building , a deal began to take shape . There would be money  --  between $6 and $8 million for the county . There would be 367 jobs , with a payroll of $10 million . Capels would clean up the illegal dump sites around the county ; Welch would dump its garbage for free . And Capels would treat the town 's sewage . In November 1988 the first contract was signed , and the landfill proposal began its journey through the state bureaucracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how little the people of McDowell discussed the proposed landfill during the three years it was under consideration . The city council had been talking about the landfill at public meetings , which were advertised in the local paper . There were TV programs and radio shows on the project . But very few people took any notice . Only five citizens directed questions to the county office set up to facilitate the landfill . Moore herself spent little time worrying about selling the project to constituents : she did n't think she had to . " We did n't have a strategy to win the landfill , " she told me later . " The sewage treatment was so important that the garbage was minor . " Moore spoke about the landfill to any group that invited her ; Charlie Thomas handled the Rotary , the Lions , and the Kiwanis . " I was n't hiding anything , " Moore said . " I 'd shout it from the rooftops . The people of Welch could n't wait to get this thing . The bigger the better , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But a political surprise awaited Mayor Moore . As if out of nowhere , opposition to the dump began to materialize in the spring of 1991 . It is unclear whether there had always been anti-dump sentiment in the county , smoldering under the surface , or whether sophisticated political organizing by environmentalists in the state capital had fanned a small ember into a firestorm of discontent . But a town that had seemed desperate to embrace this giant landfill suddenly became the scene of bitter protests against it . The first stirrings of dissent began with the Reverend Jeffrey Allen , a local Methodist minister . Allen first heard about the landfill in January 1990 , but by then , he was told , Fugett had already signed agreements with the county . He did n't know Moore herself had yet to sign the deal  --  she was hoping to get more money out of Fugett  --  but he believed there was little he could do to stop it . His doubts were confirmed by the number of signatures he collected on a petition to put the landfill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the landfill until February 1991 , when he received a phone call from Norm Steenstra , an organizer with an activist environmental group in Charleston . There are people all over McDowell who are upset about the landfill , Steenstra told Allen , and you should bring them together . But Steenstra 's promised crowds were slow in coming . When Allen held his first meeting , only eight people showed up . The next time around , though , a few more people came , and by May , Allen was drawing audiences of forty or fifty , whom he organized into a group called TEARS/WV : Team Effort Against Ruining Southern West Virginia . But why had it taken so long for opposition to the dump to coalesce ? " People had n't heard about the landfill , " Allen explained to me , somewhat improbably . " You have to understand Appalachia . If the power elite decides something is n't going to be an issue , it is n't . " He blames , in part , the extreme regionalization of the county . Rough terrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want their workers to keep in contact with one another , institutionalized apathy : dialing a telephone number five miles away counts as a long-distance call . Few people in the county read the newspaper closely , and the publisher , who supported the Capels project , did n't run a single anti-landfill story . Allen 's group began to look more closely at Fugett 's deal , and they did n't like what they saw . Although Fugett had promised more than three hundred jobs , the United Mine Workers local learned that similar landfills employ fewer than one hundred people , at low wages and with few benefits . They heard that one West Virginia landfill , run by out-of-staters , had fired several employees just before Christmas for trying to unionize . TEARS wanted to know if Capels jobs would be safe jobs . Fugett had promised the public that the landfill would accept only municipal solid waste , sewage sludge , and incinerator ash . It would take no medical or nuclear waste  --  nothing , Fugett said , that was hazardous or toxic . But incinerator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arsenic , cadmium , lead , and mercury . The ash can contaminate soil , ground water , and surface water ; in the form of fly ash , it can be ingested or inhaled . Nor is household refuse entirely benign : the average household generates fifteen pounds of hazardous waste per year  --  cleaning agents , fertilizers , paint , automotive products , and so on  --  most of which goes out with the eggshells and cereal boxes . In addition , virtually all landfills release methane , a toxic gas , and some emit vinyl chloride , a known carcinogen . Neither gas respects landfill boundaries : tests done in California have shown that illegal levels of gases accumulate not only over landfills but over nearby residential areas as well . The more TEARS learned , the more outraged they became . According to the EPA , they discovered , 3 percent of all municipal-waste workers are injured each year through handling or exposure to hazardous substances . Of 1,235 Superfund sites  --  the environmental messes the EPA has assigned the highest priority for cleanup  --  about 240 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow and inexorable drip of leachate , the toxic gunk that seeps through trash and settles to the bottom of a landfill , where it has the potential to contaminate surface water or , even more insidiously , continue its journey all the way to the water table . The community 's growing suspicions that the dump might be more dangerous than they had been told were intensified by memories of the coal years , when companies , as a matter of course , misled their workers about environmental hazards and job security . To those who 'd been burned by King Coal  --  the hundreds who did n't have clean drinking water or whose houses , shoved into narrow valleys , suffered yearly floods and endured mud slides that poured down from denuded mountains  --  the landfill began to look less like an exercise in cooperative capitalism than like a return to colonialism . " You 've got the county dependent on the benevolence of a private corporation , " Reverend Allen explained , " and suddenly it 's not 1991 anymore but 1891 . " The issue that stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neocolonialism , dubious liners , or tipping fees ; it was the specter of out-of-state garbage . McDowell County did n't mind burying its own trash , but many residents had deep-rooted fears of outsiders ' garbage . And they particularly did n't want trash from New York and New Jersey , which together export more than all other states combined . Throughout last summer , the national media conspired to heighten awareness of the perils , real or imagined , of imported waste : there were television programs about Mafia involvement in East Coast landfills and newspaper stories about cargo trucks spilling out-of-state garbage onto the highway . One TEARS broadsheet suggested the landfill would spread AIDS , be run by the Mafia , and accept hidden toxics and nuclear waste . It 's difficult to say exactly why Eastern trash is maligned so , but the infamous Mobro barge , which roamed the Atlantic for four months in 1987 with garbage from Long Island , offers a clue . If no one wanted that trash , perhaps there was good reason . Were mobsters " cocktailing " household garbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or New Jerseyites were disguising sewage sludge . A Welch artist preyed on these fears with his eight-foot-high billboard , erected on a lawn along Route 52 . In vivid , angry colors , the sign depicted a skinny , bearded Fugett squatting atop a mammoth trash heap of crossbones , nuclear symbols , hypodermic needles , and other sinister detritus , surrounded by the letters NY , NJ , and PA . The sign read , " Home of the world 's largest cancer-causing water-polluting rate infested toxic waste dump . Best kept secret has finally leaked out in McDowell County . Say no to Capels Landfill . " It is precisely to counter this sort of " negative advertising " that the garbage industry has lately been working hard to change its image . Nobody even calls the stuff garbage anymore  --  it 's " solid waste "  --  and dumps have been rechristened " landfills " or " transfer stations . " To calm fears about transporting large quantities of solid waste , rail companies now use newfangled waste containers that do n't smell , leak , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shinier than the rest of the cars in the train . Yet no matter how thorough garbage 's image makeover , the persistent distrust of out-of-state waste , particularly from the East , promises to become a powerful political issue across the country . Under the new EPA rules , landfills need vast quantities of trash to be lucrative ; as McDowell County found out , the only way to make garbage pay is to import it from far away . Already , forty-two states both import and export municipal waste , and the trucks , barges , and trains that move the trash are becoming potent political symbols . In a state like West Virginia , out-of-state garbage is the sort of emotionally resonant issue that can decide an election  --  something that Governor Gaston Caperton was quick to grasp . Throughout the summer of 1991 the battle raged in McDowell County . Pro-landfill county officials ran ads calling their opponents " environmental radicals " and " outside agitators . " Employers received anonymous phone calls informing them which of their workers had attended TEARS meetings . There were taunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to press for a referendum on the landfill . Fugett was all for it : he wanted to prove once and for all that a majority favored the project . But TEARS , which was born out of a drive for such a vote , now opposed a referendum . It was a curious move . Did n't TEARS believe it could win ? " We 've got 90 percent of the county behind us , " one member told me . " We 'd win that election tomorrow . " Yet TEARS was apparently unwilling to risk losing on a popular vote ; they realized they had a better chance of appealing directly to Governor Caperton , who was up for re-election in the fall and in no mood to enrage a well-organized citizens ' group . TEARS turned on the heat . On September 31 carloads of landfill opponents began streaming into Charleston for a week 's worth of rallying and lobbying lawmakers . They were followed closely by a band of Fugett 's newest friends , most of them unemployed , who were bused in by Fugett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a decent job . By the afternoon of October 15 , the battle was over . Caperton , acutely aware of garbage 's new political power , agreed to a bill limiting the size of West Virginia 's landfills to 30,000 tons a month . For McDowell , though , he made a slight exception : on a referendum vote , the people could increase the capacity of their landfill to 50,000 tons . Caperton probably would have preferred to simply ban garbage imports outright , but the U.S. Constitution protects interstate commerce , making such a move , however politically attractive to a governor , impossible . Nevertheless , Caperton 's solution amounted to a de facto ban  --  even at 50,000 tons , a landfill that meets EPA standards ca n't make the kind of money that the waste-hauling industry has come to expect . TEARS members rejoiced ; to them , the decision marked the end of McDowell County 's decades of exploitation . Jack Fugett and the county officials who had negotiated the landfill deal were predictably crushed . Mayor Moore took Caperton 's decision especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landfill was dangerous but because it 's an election year , " she said . " Caperton knew that fifty-four counties did n't want a big landfill and only one did . But nobody cared to listen to the facts . " She blamed TEARS for ruining not only a hard-won scheme but any hope that Welch would soon be back on its feet . " For four years we worked on this , " she said angrily , " and now what do we have ? Nothing . " Garbage tends to concentrate in depressions : it rolls downhill until it hits those places most desperate to deal . McDowell had seemed to be such a place  --  far too needy and weak to withstand the temptations of a gigantic project like Capels 's . So what happens to 300,000 tons of trash a month when a place like McDowell suddenly decides not to play the role the waste industry , and the American economy , had assigned to it ? In all likelihood , this garbage  --  which is my garbage , indeed all of our garbage  --  will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle . The EPA regulations have made the economics of gigantic regional landfills irresistible . Garbage will increasingly be shipped from the richer , more populous parts of this country to those places that , out of economic desperation or lack of political strength , can not refuse to take it  --  places like Third World and Eastern European countries , where waste traders have since 1986 exported 5 million tons of toxics ; places where minorities live ( two recent studies show that 60 percent of blacks and Hispanics live in communities with one or more unregulated toxic-waste sites ) . And perhaps onto Indian reservations : because they are n't subject to state and local environmental laws , landfill operators have increasingly targeted reservations as potential dumping grounds . Waste-management companies have approached nearly every reservation in the country ; federal officials over the last several years have invited around three hundred reservations to become repositories of high-level nuclear waste . So far , nine are considering accepting . There are , of course , other , forgotten alternatives to these giant landfills : massive recycling , combined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste stream by up to 90 percent . But in my own city , the sheer volume of our trash has stymied the best efforts to reduce our garbage output . Three years into a court-ordered citywide recycling program , most of New York still recycles only newspapers , which for lack of a market often end up riding a truck  --  along with cans , bottles , plastics , and compost  --  to a landfill in Taylorville , Illinois . The garbage will find a place to go , but what about McDowell ? Exactly what sort of " victory " can the county be said to have won ? There are those in Welch today who speak of a renewed sense of pride and self-worth among McDowell Countians , who have proved to themselves that together they can resist the sort of powers that have historically had their way in this region . But still there is no sewage system , no up-to-snuff landfill , and Mayor Moore is as far from balancing her budget as ever . Soon after Caperton signed the landfill bill , ten months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local store all but collapsed . Moore stands in contempt of court for refusing to sign a second consent decree to clean up the city 's water , but the citizens ca n't afford the $63 a month per household that a new treatment system would cost . Still , the mayor plans to run for re-election this fall . The garbage issue dogs her , but she figures that once this election year is over , things might calm down a little . Then , she thinks , people are going to have to reconsider whether McDowell County can really survive without other people 's garbage . <p>
