As the two helicopters sliced through the blue skies over northern Iraq last Thursday morning , a U.S. Air Force AWACS reconnaissance plane picked them up on radar . The AWACS crew immediately radioed a pair of U.S. F-15C fighters and asked them to take a closer look . Though there had been no reported violations of the no-fly zone over northern Iraq since January 1993 , Iraqi helicopters had been a problem in the past , when Saddam Hussein used them to suppress the Kurdish rebellion that erupted after the Gulf War ended in 1991 . The crews of the F-15Cs twice flew past the copters and identified them as Russian-made Hinds flown by the Iraqi military . The fateful , terse order came back from the AWACS to fire . Moments later , the blasted helicopters , each of them struck by an air-to-air missile , plummeted to the ground . <P> As horrified Pentagon officials quickly discovered , however , the two / choppers were not Hinds but U.S. Black Hawks . On board were 21 allied military and civilian officials , including 15 Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been on their way to meet with Kurdish leaders in the northern Iraq town of Salahuddin , part of the safe haven created for the Kurds after the Gulf War . The crews of all five aircraft in the tragedy were slated to attend a rehearsal one day earlier in which they had reviewed flight routes , radio frequencies and the timing of Thursday 's mission . " There were human errors , probably , and there might be process or system errors as well , " said Defense Secretary William Perry . Postponing a long-scheduled trip to South Korea and Japan , Perry ordered one investigation into the event and another into the rules of engagement that govern the two no-fly zones in Iraq , as well as the one over Bosnia . He acknowledged that the rules in Iraq did not require fighter pilots to issue a warning to their targets . <P> Lives lost to friendly fire are a devastating cost of battle . Almost one- fourth of the 148 American combat deaths in the Gulf War resulted from accidental assault by their own side . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid such accidents . Even during the war , however , when hundreds of planes representing more than two dozen allied nations filled the skies , none of those deaths involved aircraft firing upon one another . <P> Some military analysts believe that deadly misjudgments are made more likely by battlefield technology that hands over decisions to computers . Defense officials acknowledged that last week 's mishap is likely to hamper efforts to improve the capability of new U.S. weapon systems to fire on an enemy from far away . " We were just really beginning to push beyond-visual-range technologies , " says an executive at McDonnell Douglas , builder of the F-15C . " This is going to put a brake on that .
