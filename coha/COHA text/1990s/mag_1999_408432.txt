I was 13 when Benji came into our lives . With his deep brown eyes , floppy ears and cheerful disposition , he was my constant companion throughout my teen-age years . We would play together in the garden , and take long walks over the hills behind the house and on the beach . Benji would hang on my every word with his head tilted to one side . Despite being a dog , he seemed to have a sympathy for my problems that went deeper than words could express . He was my best friend . Benji left us about 15 years ago for that great kennel in the sky . But recently I 've been thinking about him a lot . Was he really conscious ? Could any animal have consciousness like we do ? Does it matter whether animals are conscious or not ? For many , it is a matter of life and death . On the one hand , animal research has helped prevent some of the most pressing human diseases , including hepatitis B , hepatitis C , " mad cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , this research is performed largely on chimps , our closest nonhuman relatives , with whom we share 98.4% of our genetic material , and on the other great apes , with whom we are similarly biologically close . Some people feel this connection is strong enough to warrant special treatment . An international group called the Great Ape Project is pushing the government of New Zealand to adopt a bill that would give some human rights to chimpanzees , gorillas and the rest of the great apes . The Great Ape Project is lobbying the United Nations to adopt a declaration on the rights of great apes modeled on the UN declaration On the Rights of Man . The group believes that apes are " conscious " and so deserve legal protection of their right to life and freedom from imprisonment and torture . If great apes were shown to have consciousness something like our own , I would consider it among the scientific discoveries of the century . I would then agree with the Australian philosopher and founder of the animal rights movement , Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like experimenting on orphan children . That 's a pretty chilling thought , and no amount of human suffering saved could justify such an action . But before we close down the laboratories and stop searching for a vaccine against AIDS , we had better take a long hard look at the evidence for ape consciousness . What is Consciousness ? The definition of consciousness has eluded us for over a century , but many psychologists as well as supporters of the Great Ape Project agree on three classes of evidence : language , self-awareness and " theory of mind . " LANGUAGE : The mutual possession of language is surely one of the strongest indications that the being you are talking to is conscious like you . Through their work teaching language to chimpanzees , many researchers have found glimmers of " conscious " light in animals " ability to communicate : Washoe , a chimpanzee , has been taught to use American Sign Language . Today , she is enjoying a boat ride on a lake with her trainers when a swan comes into view . Washoe has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocabulary for such a thing . " Waterbird , " she signs excitedly to her human companions . Kanzi , a pygmy chimpanzee , first learned to communicate with symbols by watching his mother 's lessons . His trainer , Sue Savage-Rumbaugh , is testing him for his comprehension of sentences . " Would you please carry the straw ? " she asks him . Kanzi picks up a straw . " Give the trash to Jeanine " - Kanzi picks up the trash and brings it to the other trainer . Koko , a gorilla , has been learning American Sign Language from her trainer , Francine Patterson , for over 20 years . In April 1998 , Koko was the first nonhuman to go live on the Internet . She answered questions about her life and hopes , her desire for a baby and her dreams of freedom . SELF-AWARENESS : Self-awareness is another key ability of conscious beings . To be conscious is , firstly , to be conscious of ones self-to be aware that " I " am a being separate from others and the world around " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training with Daniel Povinelli . She has had a mirror in her quarters for several months . Today , Povinelli is testing her self-awareness with a method developed by Gordon Gallup . This morning , Megan was anesthetized . While she was unconscious , a spot of bright red nontoxic ink was daubed on her forehead . Now it is afternoon and she is fully recovered from the anesthetia Sure enough , the chimp looks in the mirror and then scratches at the spot on her forehead . To some , this proves that Megan has recognized herself and is consciously self-aware . Photograph // THEORY OF MIND : Theory of mind is an awareness that others have minds as well : " I am not the only conscious being . Others are conscious and I take this into account in my dealings with them . " Sheba is another chimpanzee being trained by Daniel Povinelli , but in quite a different experiment . Sheba has been watching one trainer put food into one of four cups . She ca n't see which cup because they are hidden from her view-but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call him the " knower " ) had some food and put it in a cup . Now the knower comes back into the room together with another trainer ( the " guesser " ) . If Sheba has a theory of mind-an awareness that the trainers have a conscious awareness of their own-she should know that the guesser did not see where the knower put the food . The two trainers are in the room . The knower points to a cup ; the guesser points to a cup . The knower points to the cup into which he had placed food earlier ; the guesser-well , he just guesses . What does Sheba do ? She chooses the cup to which the knower points . Aping Language Herb Terrace of Columbia University in New York is one of the original researchers on language in apes and now a critic of such attempts . During the 1970s , he coordinated a project teaching American Sign Language to Nim Chimpsky , a young chimpanzee named in humorous honor of the famous linguist Noam Chomsky . Whereas Terrace had hoped that Nim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community of people using it , he was disappointed to find that it was only possible to get Nim to learn by bribing him with treats . When funding for the project ran out , Terrace had time to consider his data , and he began to notice certain things : He realized that often Nim was using signs in his response that the trainers had used in their question-in effect just echoing what had been said . He also noted Nim 's spontaneous signs were almost always demands for something . He rarely asked questions or commented on the world around him , the way even young children do . And Nim 's vocabulary remained small-only about 125 signs after three year 's training . Finally , Nims utterances were typically very short-only one or two signs-and completely ungrammatical . The chimp 's longest recorded utterance was " Give orange me give eat orange me eat orange give me eat orange give me orange give me you . " Easy to understand , but without respect for basic gramnar , which even the youngest and least educated humans comprehend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his work contained critical flaws . They pointed to the " creative " use of words , like Washoe 's " waterbird " to describe a swan-surely this showed a deeper understanding of language than Nim had demonstrated . How do we know that Washoe was referring to the swan ? She could have just been naming two things she saw , water and a bird . Sue Savage-Rumbaugh has drawn attention to the fact that Kanzi appeared to pick up symbolic language simply by observing her mother 's training . This is an interesting observation , but it does not consider the fact that Kanzi is being rewarded for her use of symbols-she is usually given the thing that she names . Savage-Rumbaugh identifies Kanzi 's success in obeying commands such as " Would you please carry the straw ? " as evidence of a grammatical understanding . But was any other interpretation possible ? When Kanzi correctly carries out this instruction , does this mean that she understands the structure of the sentence-that she should carry the straw , and not that the straw should carry her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry a chimp ! Although different interpretations may be grammatically possible , in reality only one interpretation was practicable under the circumstances . Not All Smoke And Mirrors What of Megan , the chimp who wiped the ink off her forehead ? Is she showing evidence of advanced consciousness ? Gordon Gallup argues that for an animal to recognize itself in a mirror , it must have self-awareness in a form not so different from our own . He is impressed by the observation that great apes are the only mammals to show self-recognition in a mirror ( although in the 1980s , Robert Epstein , Robert Lanza and B.E Skinner demonstrated that , with training , even pigeons can pass Gallup 's mirror test , which means it may not be so tough ) .

Below : A captive orangutan peers through the bars of his cage in Borneo . Photograph // The problem with Gallup 's interpretation is that there are people who can not recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully self-aware . Blind people can not recognize themselves in mirrors but we have plenty of other indications that they are self-aware . People brought up in communities that do not have mirrors do not instantly recognize themselves when they are first shown their own reflection . There is also a form of brain damage called prosopagnosia , which leads to an inability to recognize faces . In extreme forms of prosopagnosia , the patient may not even recognize his own reflection . Conversely , there are people who have problems with self-awareness , but who recognize themselves in mirrors normally . People who suffer from autism have an impaired ability to see themselves as others view them , and yet they recognize themselves in a mirror with no problem . In light of these revelations , it does not make sense to treat mirror recognition in chimps as a measure of self-awareness . No Monkey Business Povinelli 's " guesser-knower " experiment was partially modeled on theory of mind tests in children : A child or chimp who has an awareness that others have minds , can readily see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you or I were put in the guesser-knower experiment , we would almost immediately choose the cup the knower points to because we have a theory of mind that guides our behavior . Sheba the chimp , however , required hundreds of training sessions before she began consistently choosing the cup pointed to by the knower , and even then she was successful only 75% of the time . This suggests she was gradually learning an association between a stimulus ( the " knower " ) and a reward , and not treating them as people with minds . Human Minds in Ape Bodies ? Much has been made of the fact that chimps are our closest living relatives . But DNA does n't tell us anything about what traits and abilities two species have in common . In making claims for the intelligence of dolphins , no one feels inhibited by the fact that dolphins ' closest living relatives out of the ocean are cows and sheep . Chimpanzees and other apes are wonderful animals , fully worthy of ethical treatment and protection . But they are not human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even half human . They are 100% animals on their own terms . The desire to see animals as human is unbearably strong . But if we are going to consider closing down AIDS and hepatitis research and giving " human " rights to chimps , we had better be certain we are not just giving in to a natural but baseless , anthropomorphic tendency without solid evidence to back us up . I am not disappointed that the attempts to find human-like consciousness in apes have failed . On the contrary , I find it profoundly exciting and liberating . We are surrounded on this planet not by thingslike-people dressed in fur and feathers , but by myriad beings , each with its own unique psychology . As an animal psychologist , I ca n't think of any challenge more exciting than trying to understand animals in their own right and not just as dumber versions of ourselves .
