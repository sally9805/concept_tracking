<p> Sooner or later , the irony strikes all but the most ardent December-philes : The season of goodwill , good cheer and jollity can really get grim . <p> Not only is there more to do than can be done  --  decorating , entertaining , shopping , mailing , baking and on and on  --  but there 's also a lot of downright bad cheer going around . Just look at the desperation on the faces of drivers playing chicken for parking places , or parents hunting down the season 's fad toy . <p> Complaints about the commercialization of the holidays are n't new . But now the holiday hype machine has a fresh antagonist  --  the small but growing Simplicity Movement . <p> On the grandest level , the loosely knit Simplicity Movement , with its message of living more frugally and deliberately , aims to save the Earth from overconsumption , to keep people from going broke buying needless stuff and to restore meaning to modern lives . On a more basic level , it offers an alternative way of thinking for people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be particularly apt during the December frenzy . <p> " Especially at the holidays , it really makes sense , " says Maria Peagler , 35 , of Alpharetta . <p> She and her husband , David , were drawn to the movement to keep their finances in order  --  despite urgings from their real estate agent and mortgage company , they bought a less-expensive house than they could have . Now the idea of simplicity spills over into other parts of their lives . <p> " We say , ' Let 's make a choice about what we do , ' " says Peagler . <p> Which is how the Peaglers , with their 2-year-old son , approached the holidays . In November , they pulled out a calendar . " We decided on the things that were important , and what we could cut out , " she says . <p> One thing that did n't make the cut was extensive shopping , minimized by their decision not to buy presents for adults in their extended family , a decision that was well-received . " Everybody was relieved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> In place of such traditional holiday goings-on , she says , " we 've decided to do a lot of things with our church this year . " <p> Though her family has been understanding , Peagler does realize she 's in the minority among American holiday celebrants , who still clog the shopping centers . She tried to form a study group on simplicity in the northern suburbs , posting a note on a Web site devoted to simplicity , but got only three inquiries . <p> " You 're definitely bucking the trend , " she says . " I get reactions like , ' You 're no fun ' or ' Bah , humbug ! ' " <p> " I do n't think we 're quite making an impact on mainstream America , " agrees Kalle Lasn , an evangelist for an environmentalist , anti-consumption brand of simplicity . Lasn is a co-founder of the Vancouver , British Columbia-based Media Foundation , which attacks advertising hype and sponsors Buy Nothing Day after Thanksgiving each year . The movement still has " a flaky New Age aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as global environmental problems become more acute , and people feel more stress from a compulsion to buy things , the movement will continue to gain momentum , he argues . Buy Nothing Day , begun in the Pacific Northwest in 1992 , inspires national press coverage and " shenanigans " by activists around the world . <p> " For the first time in the history of capitalism , consumption is suddenly becoming controversial , " he says . " It 's the big debate of our time . Is the American system OK ? Will technological fixes for our problems be found ? Or is America in denial ? " <p> The message of simplicity has gone fully mainstream in at least one place : the bookstore . Titles such as " Simple Living Guide , " " Unplug the Christmas Machine " and " Use Less Stuff " abound . <p> The Atlanta-based bookstore chain Chapter 11 held a signing last week for Californian Elaine St. James , author of " Simplify Your Christmas " ( Andrews McMeel , $ 14.95 ) . <p> " These books seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokeswoman for Chapter 11 . " I think the simplicity thing is really catching on . " <p> One of the most well-known books on the subject is Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin 's " Your Money or Your Life " ( Penguin USA , $ 12.95 ) , published in 1993 . It promotes a less-is-more mind-set , particularly with regard to spending money . <p> The message stunned Jef Murray and his wife , Lorraine , who read the book soon after it appeared . " It was like being hit by a Mack truck , " says Jef , 38 , a DeKalb County resident and research engineer at Georgia Tech . " I had to do a lot of soul-searching . " <p> The couple had been troubled by a feeling that their earn-to-spend lifestyle had become stressful and unfulfilling . Murray says they decided " we had way more than enough . We can live a good life by spending less money . " <p> They cut back on eating out and on possessions , moves that paid both financial and spiritual dividends , Murray says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come into a house that 's not just crammed with geegaws , doo-dads and stereo equipment piled to the ceiling . " <p> Their new lifestyle left more room for religion . Lorraine reconnected with her Catholic faith , and Jef converted . <p> During the Christmas season , Jef Murray says , they tap into the pre-modern Catholic tradition of " quiet reflection and contemplation . " Instead of buying presents or decorating elaborately , they have friends in for a potluck supper or a home Mass . <p> " It 's made so much difference not being caught up in the holiday rat race , " Murray says . " It 's insane . People spend money and get aggravated . Then it 's over , and they have n't had time to take a breath and enjoy it . " <p> The Murrays urge friends and families to cut back too , and not to buy them geegaws as presents . Their rule is that if any nonedible possession enters the house , another must leave . When a gift arrives , it often goes straight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to await the next church fund-raising sale . <p> Like Peagler , the Murrays realize they 're a bit out of the mainstream . " We get our share of ' Why ca n't you be normal ? ' " Jef Murray says . Unlike their Alpharetta comrade , however , they 've been able to find support by starting a study group , which continues to meet twice a month at St. Thomas More Church in Decatur , using " Your Money or Your Life " as a text . <p> One member of the group is Peggy Mann , 43 , of Decatur , who was drawn to the Simplicity Movement not for financial reasons , but by " a growing sense of wanting to live a less chaotic , less hectic life . " <p> The holidays were a particular burden , she says . " Christmas has always felt like this runaway train , and I just hated that . " <p> Before adopting tenets of the Simplicity Movement , Mann used to stress herself over buying impressive presents for her extended family and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture-perfect holiday . <p> " In my mind , I loved to have this ideal , big Christmas , " she says . " But I 've had to grow up and realize my cousins do n't like each other , and getting together was always as unpleasant as it could be . " <p> Now she gives simpler , practical gifts , like her homemade spaghetti sauce , and has given up on the family gathering , replacing it with something more fulfilling : " What I really like is a quiet Christmas , going to Mass at midnight and sleeping late on Christmas Day , " Mann says . <p> " Before , I would be trying to impress people you ca n't impress , " she says . " It takes a burden off when you 're accepting of the way things really are . I feel freed . " <p> 3 Santas . / WALTER CUMMING / Staff
