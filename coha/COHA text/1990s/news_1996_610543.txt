<p> Can this be a church ? The sign out front says so : " Covenant Life Church . " But something does n't jibe . It looks like any other suburban office building in Montgomery County  --  brown brick and beige concrete and tinted glass , surrounded by blacktop . <p> Two-story wings run off each side of this Gaithersburg structure . There 's a portico covering the front door underneath a peaked roof . Is it a steeple ? Or the roof of an office atrium ? Outside stands a 14-foot cross , made of dark timber . It 's the same color and spare design as the light poles in the parking lot . It 's easy to miss . Can this be a church ? <p> Step inside . <p> It 's two weekends before Christmas , and the 10 a.m . Sunday service is just underway . It takes off like a guitar riff  --  the joint is rocking . Two thousand worshipers are packed into a " multipurpose room , " standing , clapping , hands raised . They sing along to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an electric guitar , bass and piano . The lyrics are projected onto a screen hanging over the stage , just about where the cross would be in a more traditional church . The musical style is Contemporary Christian ; it sounds like rock-and-roll lite . The lyrics are non-rhyming affirmations of faith : <p> " I dare not stand <p> on my righteousness . <p> My every hope rests <p> on what Christ has done . " <p> Music takes up the first hour of the service , followed by messages and announcements from some of the 10 pastors . Communion is received , collections are taken . Then comes an hour-long sermon , delivered by Kenneth Maresco , assistant pastor for evangelism . <p> " This is the season that the culture celebrates , albeit sometimes reluctantly , the birth of Christ , the idea of God made flesh , " he says . " This season gives us the opportunity to share the gospel of grace . " <p> So when you go to Circuit City , to Giant , to Jerry 's sub shop , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share the Bible . But be wise , he warns . After he began evangelizing in college , he wore a wooden cross around his neck so large that a professor fliply suggested Maresco might have gotten whiplash if he 'd rounded a corner too quickly . That turned people off , Maresco realized , and he began a less confrontational , but no less committed , approach . Exactly the sort of soul saving practiced by Covenant Life . <p> The largest growth in U.S. churches over the past couple of decades has been among nondenominational congregations like this one . They 've exploded all across the country , prospering chiefly in the suburbs , where there 's still land to build big churches . Also , suburbia is where the baby boomers are , especially the younger ones , who make up the bulk of the population of these churches . <p> The popular term is " megachurch , " which means two things : lots of bodies in the pews ( if , indeed there are pews , which are increasingly uncommon ) and lots of items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , financial counseling seminars , parenting classes and so on . <p> But it 's not just about age groups and incomes . It 's about the way people worship . Almost all of these growing nondenominational churches preach evangelism  --  taking Jesus to the people and converting nonbelievers . This is not your father 's Sunday-only religion . This is religion for people who believe in a seven-day-a-week relationship with God . Their church is a place that teaches about Heaven and Hell in a time when popular culture seems to regard sin as obsolete . <p> " They accept that people are on journeys looking to find God , " says Prof. Wade Clark Roof of the University of California , Santa Barbara , the author of a book on baby boomers and religion called " Generation of Seekers . " Churches such as Covenant Life " do n't force a lot of historic doctrine down your throat . A lot of these churches meet in warehouses or schools or places that look architecturally quite different than traditional churches . The point is to break down barriers " erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covenant Life ends a little over two hours after it began . Church members stack the 2,000 purplish banquet chairs one atop the other . Once the chairs are moved away , the floor is revealed , showing a short-nubbed carpet lined like a basketball court , which it was the day before . Collapsing hydraulic backboards , like those at college basketball games , stand in a side room . <p> Just feet away from the hoops , an assistant pastor talks to half a dozen people . This is their first time at Covenant Life and they 've just watched a 12-minute video about the church that features testimonials from members and seemingly endless picnics and volleyball games . They ask questions and munch on cookies . <p> Out back , kids climb and swing in the playground . Boys wrestle and pound each other . Teenage boys and girls flirt . <p> Mostly , though , it seems no one 's in a hurry to leave . Assistant pastors stand around the sanctuary , talking to clots of members , some of whom absently push strollers back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lobby is filled with smiles and conversation : <p> " . . . sanctification of God . . . " <p> " . . . like Ken was saying today . . . " <p> " . . . we 're working on the prison outreach . . . " <p> " . . . but the Redskins have to win today to stay in the playoffs . . . " <p> " . . . no , I have n't done a bit of Christmas shopping yet . . . " <p> In My Father 's House <p> Are Many Mansions <p> Covenant Life members John and Chung-Hae Casler host a small flock in their Rockville home twice a month . Everyone sings and worships for the first hour , gathered around the piano in the basement . Then the children of the 30 or so church members stay downstairs , coloring Bible storybooks or watching videos . Upstairs , the adults deal with their lives . <p> One thing they do is pray for the needs of each other and the church as a whole . John Casler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army Medical Center , applies his scientific empiricism and keeps a scorecard of how many prayers have been answered . Right now , God 's answering about 80 percent . Those that go unanswered , Casler says , are attributable to praying for the wrong thing , or answers still in progress or simply the ultimate mystery of God , which can be devastating . As when the Caslers lost a child in infancy even after fervent prayers . The small group surrounding the Caslers was invaluable during that time . <p> " We prayed that our baby would survive , but she did n't , and even if she did survive she would have been on a respirator for a long time , and maybe severely handicapped , " John Casler says . " The natural tendency is to get depressed and bitter and shake your fist at God . But if you believe what the Bible says about God , it says God is a good and loving father . After we lost her , we felt so very comforted and cared for , feeling God 's peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The church considers the Caslers ' group and about 70 others like it the backbone of its ministry . As Covenant Life continues to grow  --  and the pastors have watched the edges of the Sunday morning service sprawl farther and farther from the dais  --  the small groups become even more vital . It is the same problem the suburbs themselves face : how to grow while maintaining a sense of community . <p> In 1977 , senior pastor C.J. Mahaney founded Covenant Life with a couple of hundred refugees from a successful midweek Bible class he had disbanded . They met in a former elementary school in Silver Spring , then a lodge in Gaithersburg , at one point growing so large that they held simultaneous services in four different high schools on Sunday mornings . Three years ago , they built the church near the intersection of Shady Grove and Muncaster Mill roads , adjacent to some farmland . <p> The congregation has grown at a 5 to 10 percent clip each year since it was founded and that rate shows no signs of abating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year ; next year 's will be $ 3.2 million . Growth is good , from a financial point of view , and it also means Covenant Life 's evangelism seems to be working  --  more bodies in the chairs means more hearts brought to Christ . <p> But Mahaney and his assistant pastors worry that the size of the flock will make it more difficult to foster the strong personal relationships and accountability on which this church is founded . They consciously fight against seeming Too Big . An unofficial motto is : " The longer you 're here , the smaller we become . " <p> " We are very much wrestling with the church 's growth , " Mahaney says . " People are immediately impressed by the sheer size , but they should be impressed by the character of our members . " <p> The pastors chafe at the term " megachurch . " " It 's a marketing term , " says assistant pastor John Loftness . " It connotes the idea that bigger is always better . That 's not always true . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible can be applied to real-world problems , like failing marriages or troubled children . Maybe more important , though , the small groups are about accountability : It 's easier to hide in a large group . Members of the small groups support but also rebuke each other . It is considered one of the key elements of Christian growth . <p> " Some of the people who leave Covenant Life want to be anonymous but ca n't be in our church , " says Mahaney . " They want to see the large television show and leave . " <p> For the Children <p> Polite children are everywhere before and after Sunday services . One large section of the church is devoted to what the church calls " children 's ministries , " which is Sunday school and child care while parents and their teenagers are in the service . Each child wears a sticker with a number . If a parent needs to be summoned during the service , the child 's number is flashed on electronic signs above and to each side of the stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of whom wear uniforms and are children of church members . The church also helps the 100 or so members who home-school their kids . <p> Children are one of the defining characteristics of the suburbs . Churches like Covenant Life share that emphasis , in part because it brings in new members . When kids hit 4 , 5 , 6 years old , parents start thinking about moral instruction as well as the ABCs . And that often causes grown-ups to consider their own faith . <p> The conventional view of suburbia is one of prosperity : A house with a couple of cars in the garage . Kids . Vacations . Mountains of Things . Most of Covenant Life 's members are 25 to 45 years old , well-educated professionals ; they have children and live within a few miles of the church . They 're folks who look as if they have it all . Or do they ? <p> A number of the 2,090 members ( including 965 under 18 ) found their way to the church , says Loftness , with a question : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over a period of time , they realize that suburbia has n't delivered as advertised , " he says . <p> " One of the challenges of the suburbs is that prosperity makes for a context not conducive to recognizing true needs , " adds pastor Mahaney . <p> People come to the suburbs seeking a better way  --  a bigger house , better schools , safer neighborhoods . Also , they seek answers to life and many have the belief that the answers are knowable . People come to Covenant Life searching for Meaning . <p> Kenny and Gracie Roy have seen this firsthand . At a party once , the Roys , church members for the past six years , were questioned about Covenant Life by a neighbor in Olney . The more they told her , the more excited she became . <p> " After a while , it came out : ' We want something for our children , ' she said . ' Here we 've got this beautiful house and all these things , but we ca n't give our children any spiritual perspective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a number of people right there in our own cul-de-sac . " <p> God 's Linemen <p> In 1976 , Kenny Roy was an honorable mention all-America defensive back at the University of Maryland , good enough to play a few games in the NFL after graduation . He was a local basketball and football prep hero , starring for DeMatha High School basketball teams that were among the nation 's best . By age 28 , he had it all : a $ 400,000 house in the Washington suburbs , a wife , two kids and a management job with Xerox . Already , though , the doubts were starting : What 's missing ? <p> A few years later , the divorce hit . The children went with his ex-wife . He was alone and the space inside him seemed bigger than ever . Then he met Gracie . The daughter of a Nebraska preacher , she befriended Roy and then began ministering to him , telling him that he could have a personal relationship with God . Roy had been raised in a boys home , surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school . He knew about religion . But this " personal relationship " was new . <p> Now , Roy can be seen enthusiastically singing onstage at Covenant Life on Sunday mornings , a microphone in one hand , his other in the air above his head . He understands the spiritual hunger of his fellow suburbanites who toil under an ethos of acquisition . <p> " The baby boomers are out there and they 've come up through their careers and they say , ' Now what ? ' " he says . " It 's never enough . As I was going through my separation and divorce , I looked at all I had and wondered why I was n't happy . That 's problematic for baby boomers . They think , ' There 's got to be more than just this . ' Their corporate careers do n't bring true happiness for themselves and families out in the suburbs . " <p> Mahaney also grew up in these suburbs . He recites his personal testimony : He was a Springbrook High School longhair who played a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the SAT twice , both times coming down off acid trips . His scores were n't high enough to get him into the University of Maryland , so he went to a small college in North Carolina for a year , where he got busted for possession of marijuana . He got off on a technicality , then went to Fairmont State College in West Virginia , to be under the eye of his older brother , who coached the swim team . Back at his parents ' home for the summer , he was visited by a childhood friend . Mahaney sat in his room , fired up a hash pipe and offered his friend a drag . The friend refused , which surprised Mahaney . <p> He had n't seen anything yet . <p> Hours later , after his friend had preached the gospel , Mahaney walked outside , looked up at the stars and gave his life to Christ . Not that he stopped getting high . He even thought he had found a passage in the Book of Genesis that justified it . Then , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants . <p> " Someone came up to me and said , ' I want you to talk to somebody who 's new on the crew . I 've told him you 're a new kind of Christian and it 's possible to be a Christian and continue to smoke dope . ' Right then , I realized what I was doing was wrong . I never smoked again , " Mahaney says . <p> Not everyone at Covenant Life has come to the church spiritually or emotionally crippled . But such stories are common among evangelical churchgoers . Members quickly admit to being weak before God  --  confessing one 's weakness is the first step to salvation , the Scriptures say . Believers say the penitent man is humble before God and his fellow man . <p> " Regrettably , it often takes a crisis to bring someone to God , " Mahaney says . " Sometimes it takes suffering to see the difference between perceived needs and real spiritual needs . " <p> " We are like blocks of stone out of which the Sculptor carves forms of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chisel , which hurt us so much , are what make us perfect . " <p> Our Daily Bread <p> On Monday , the multipurpose room at Covenant Life was still , except for Shawn Hooper and his wooden yardstick . <p> More than 2,000 chairs sat shoulder-to-shoulder , poised for a bulging Christmas Eve service . Hooper walked from row to row , laying his yardstick atop the chairs , making sure each row was exactly three feet apart . <p> " It 's a tight fit , I think , " he says . " At least a lot of people have said so . I guess we need more room . " Then he catches himself . " Actually , God has blessed us with this building . We 're lucky to have it . " <p> Hooper , a 19-year-old redhead , has just finished his finals at Montgomery College in Rockville ( " Yesss ! ! " ) . He 's a sophomore majoring in information systems , but wants to do " whatever will honor God . " Right now he works about 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Covenant Life because his parents did . He stays because he sees members practicing seven-day-a-week Christianity in his small group , at social functions , everywhere . " People are the same the whole week as they are here on Sunday , " he says , sweeping the yardstick around the empty hall . <p> Fixed to the floor under Hooper 's feet are parallel white strings , about six feet apart . They ran up each side of the room 's long aisles , and marked their width . Hooper arranges the chairs so that the end of each row just touches the strings . When worshipers arrived for the Christmas Eve service last night , they could look up the long rows toward the front of the church and see that the aisles do not curve . They are perfectly straight paths , and well marked . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : December 28 , 1996 <p> CORRECTION : An article about Covenant Life Church in Wednesday 's Style section should have stated that church member Kenny Roy lived at the St. Joseph 's Home for Boys for seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the orphanage at age 10 , he moved back in with his father .
