<p> THE modern university has been criticized almost since its inception for its indifference to students . Periodically university presidents and critics of the university call for faculty members to take teaching more seriously . The presidents of Stanford and Harvard recently took their faculties to task for their neglect of teaching . Over the years none of these exhortations has had a noticeable effect . They are accompanied by reiterations that the primary function of a great university is research . What 's needed , critics say , is a " better balance between teaching and research . " <p> Few of these exhorters have seriously questioned the " publish or perish " canon that so distorts the educational mission of the " great universities . " The issue is not that of achieving a " better balance between research and teaching , " but of exposing the fallacies behind the insistence on publishing as a condition for promoting faculty . The most fundamental fallacy is the notion that any conscientiously done piece of research is by definition a significant contribution to knowledge . This is false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increment of research was a potentially useful addition to our knowledge in a field , the fact is our repositories of information are inundated by a flood of research . We are suffering in every disciplinary field from information overload . Research is driven , in the main , not by a passion for learning , but by the **39;263;TOOLONG syndrome . In the face of what amounts to a public scandal , the pressures on academics to publish what is , in large part , mediocre or useless research increase rather than diminish . <p> How best to dramatize this situation so that long overdue reforms can begin ? One way may be to demonstrate the high cost of the present system . There is general recognition in the US of the accelerating cost of a college education . Perhaps , if it can be shown that a great part of this huge expense is not only unnecessary but an impediment to education , the public may be sufficiently aroused to demand reform . <p> William Schaefer , a professor of literature at UCLA , recently reflected on his experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modern Language Association . Schaefer estimates that in a two-year period over 1,000 scholarly articles were submitted for publication - 500 a year . Only 50 were judged worthy of publication - about 5 percent . After reading this horror story , I thought to " cost out " the faculty time spent on research ( what I term Faculty Research Time , FRT ) for the 950 rejected articles ) . <p> If we calculate that each article took two-thirds of a faculty member 's time for six months , and said faculty member 's salary was $50,000 per year , we get a figure of $16,000 in Faculty Research Time per article . Multiplying $16,000 by 950 articles equals $15,400,000 worth of faculty time , time that is , in essence , taken away from students . <p> There are some 1,000 scholarly journals in the field of language and literature alone . Using the FRT formula for these 1,000 , we get a figure of roughly $800 million plus estimated editorial costs of $250 million , for a total of more than a billion dollars . <p> Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of the humanities - albeit the largest field . If we apply Smith 's Faculty Research Time formula to the thousands of journals in other areas of the humanities and social sciences , the billions in cost are compounded . <p> Appropriately included in the cost of scholarly journals is the expense to research libraries of " acquisitioning " and cataloging them . Research libraries are forced to pay extravagant charges to subscribe to scholarly journals . The average cost of subscriptions in the humanities , for example , rose from $90 in 1977 to $255 in 1989 . In the social sciences it increased from $145 to $418 - about 280 percent . The high cost to libraries of subscriptions is , in practical fact , a form of coerced subsidization . There are some 300 research libraries in the US . If they each spend $700,000 to $3.5 million a year on scholarly journals and serials , we get an average of $1 million times 300 libraries - or $300 million more . <p> In the sciences one finds even grosser inflation . Here the information overload is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates that over a million articles a year are published in the sciences . Most go unread . As long ago as 1960 a UNESCO Bulletin for Libraries noted " the multiplicity of journals ( in the sciences ) results in a scattering of papers which makes it impossible for the scientist to keep informed of new developments , impossible for a library to cover the field completely , and impossible for abstracting services to include all the relevant articles . " A " highly specialized periodical is generally of interest to only 10 percent " of those working " in the subject area , " one Bulletin author noted . <p> The pressure to publish in the sciences may contribute to the growing number of cases of cheating or " cooking the evidence , " i.e. , making false or exaggerated claims that can not be validated . <p> While scholarly journals consume half or more of the budgets of research libraries , the heart and soul of academic publishing , especially in the non-science fields , is the university press . In the humanities and the social sciences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At one university the formula is said to be : one book plus six articles equals tenure ; two books plus four more articles are required for a full professorship . <p> The American Association of University Presses recently conducted a survey of monographs published in the humanities and social-sciences fields by 45 of its member presses between 1978 and 1988 . The total came to 6,922 . Several facts emerged . First , the number of titles published yearly had increased over the period while the average sales per volume had declined 33 percent , causing , in the words of the report , " serious financial problems . " The report , incidently , does not even touch on so-called " fractional publishing , " where only a few dozen copies of a particular monograph are printed , with more printed " on demand . " <p> The cost of producing the 6,922 scholarly works published during the period 1978-1988 may be calculated using my FRT formula . The cost of research time , again with the median salary of $50,000 , for the five years it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $165,000 . If the manuscript is selected for publication , publishing costs will run to some $10,000 per monograph . We thus have a cost of $175,000 to $200,000 per monograph regardless of its quality . Out of the 6,922 monographs published during that decade , I suspect it is generous to concede that a third ( and these in the most neglected fields - China , Middle East , etc. ) are useful . That leaves us with an excess of 4,600 works at a cost of $175,000 each , or $850 million . <p> A recent survey of faculty publishing indicated that one-third of the manuscripts published by university presses in 1973 had been submitted to four or five presses . A number of authors had given up after submitting to a median number of 11 publishers . Manuscripts " temporarily shelved " - whose authors abandoned the effort to get them published - was 33 percent . If we assume that the number of faculty hours spent producing a manuscript that never finds a publisher is equivalent to the number of hours spent producing a marginally publishable monograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will never see the light of day . <p> Then there is the related matter of faculty salaries . In the period from 1970 to 1989 , the median salary of a full professor at Harvard rose from $42,000 to $93,000 , an increase of 112 percent over a period when the rate of inflation was about 50 percent . Other " great universities " have followed suit . A professor from an East Coast university , for example , was recently lured to the University of California at Irvine for a salary of $108,000 per year , plus $20,000 a year for research expense . High salaries are almost invariably accompanied by lighter teaching loads . <p> Finally , we should not overlook the enormous sums distributed by various federal agencies to universities for research of interest to the government , most of it coming from the Department of Defense and NASA , plus substantial sums from the National Institutes of Health . Billions of dollars flow from these sources . Many critics consider these grants a corruption . Certainly they can be factored in as a cost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colleges charge a preposterously high overhead for administering such grants . Stanford University is presently being investigated by the federal government for gross misuse of such funds . <p> To summarize : American universities are caught in an expensive and irrational process , one in which there is no justification between costs and returns . It is a ritual activity with little relation to the classic notion of research and scholarship , or to any identifiable intellectual mission . This tide of mediocrity threatens to overwhelm research libraries and information systems with the sheer weight of indigestible and largely inaccessible facts . It also diverts money and attention from areas needing more scholarly attention . <p> There are numerous victims of this cancerous growth - professors , libraries , taxpayers , parents who pay preposterous tuitions , and , most important of all , undergraduate students who do n't get the attention they deserve . <p> The question is : What is to be done ? Will we go on as we have until the great bloated mass collapses of its own weight , or do we have the resolution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we think about the aims of higher education ?
