The F-22 air superiority fighter pushes the envelopes of stealth and speed . Photograph // They call it Raptor and it truly is the most fearsome bird in the sky . Its mission is to control the highest ground , the airspace above the battle area . It is a simple but effective strategy . The Air Force boasts that no U.S. ground soldier has been killed by enemy aircraft in more than 40 years , a period that includes the Vietnam War , invasions of Panama and Grenada , and Desert Storm . Keeping hostile skies all-American has been the job of some noteworthy fighters , including the F- 100 Super Sabre and F-4 Phantom . For the past 20 years the U.S. Air Force 's alpha wolf has been the twin-engine F- 15C Eagle air superiority fighter . Although the Eagle is superb at its work-F- 15Cs shot down 32 enemy fighters in air-to-air combat during the Gulf War-foreignmade fighters with equal or superior capabilities are becoming operational , as is a new generation of ultralethal , foreign-made missiles . Thus , the possibility exists that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have a God-given right to air dominance , " says former Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Ronald Fogleman . " Somebody 's got to invest in it . " Proud Heritage With continued , undisputed mastery of the skies in mind , the Air Force began developing a successor for the then-new F- 15 back in the mid- 1970s . Studies revealed that to dominate airspace in the 21st century , an aircraft would have to be very fast , agile , well-armed , and although the term was still classified , stealthy . After considering six separate proposals , in 1986 the Air Force issued development contracts for two fighter designs , the YF-22 ( above ) to be built by Lockheed in partnership with Boeing and General Dynamics , and the YF-23 from Northrop teamed with McDonnell Douglas . The service also ordered competing engines from General Electric and Pratt &; Whitney . Photograph // The competition to be chosen to build the service 's Advanced Tactical Fighter was intense : The winner would receive contracts for up to 750 aircraft worth tens of billions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By 1990 , the two prototypes were dogfighting for their futures in evaluation flights over Edwards Air Force Base in California . In April of the following year the Air Force selected as its winner the Lockheed/ Boeing/General Dynamics design , powered by a pair of Pratt &; Whitney Fl 119-PW- 100 engines . The YF-22 would become the F-22 . It would not only be America 's 21st century fighter , it would raise the technological bar for an air performance aircraft to follow . Continued flight and wind-tunnel testing resulted in refinements to the design , and in December 1993 parts fabrication began for the first flying F-22 . The division of work had Boeing handling software and avionics integration and building the aft fuselage and wings . Lockheed 's Fort Worth division , which it acquired from General Dynamics in 1993 , was responsible for the midfuselage and armament . And what was then LockheedMarietta , and is now Lockheed Martin , was charged with building the forward fuselage , vertical fins and stabilators , and landing gear , and doing the final assembly . On April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , workers cheering and salutes and smiles everywhere , the first true F-22 was unveiled in Lockheed Martin 's Georgia assembly plant , while the walls reverberated with the strains of " The Spirit of America . " " This is a great day for America , " Fogleman said . " We have no desire to control the world . We have an equally great desire to see that no one else controls the world . " The Raptor 's mission is to see that no one does . Into The Sky The aircraft began flight trials in May of 1997 . Eventually it could be joined by additional development and preproduction models , for a five-year program of flight and ground testing . Whether this amazing aircraft goes into full production remains an open question . The Pentagon has already slashed costs in the F-22 program by slowing its development and reducing the planned fleet size to 438 aircraft . Still , with each aircraft valued at somewhere between $70 million and a breathtaking $198 million , depending on how costs are computed , the program is undeniably expensive-perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug on production money , but still allocated more than $1 billion for continued development . So , as we go to press , the program continues to move forward . Photograph The Fl 19-PW-100 has 40 percent fewer major parts than current engines . High-temperature Alloy C titanium is used in the compressor stator and the thrust-vectoring nozzle . // Inside The - F- 22 // The problem is that the airplane was supposed to trump the Soviets ' next generation of weaponry . But now the Soviets are gone and Russia 's military is barely able to put down internal conflicts . Many in Washington question the need to build the F-22 at all . The Pentagon also wants to develop the single-seat F/A-18E and the two-seat F/A-18F maritime strike attack Super Hornet , plus the Joint Strike Fighter . Budget cutters say there 's not enough money to go around . If the original F-22 survives and the current schedule remains intact , production could begin within a year , with the first unit becoming operational as early as 2004 . The last aircraft would be delivered to the Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( its exact weight is classified ) of titanium , aluminum , thermoplastic composites , fiberoptic lines , silicon , rubber and glass molded into a twin-tailed package , the jet measures 62 ft . I in. long , 44 ft. 6 in. wide , and 16 ft. 5 in. tall . It is the most sophisticated aircraft ever to have lifted off a runway . To build this 21 st century wonder , the Air Force drew upon all the knowledge gained in developing the F- I 17A stealth fighter , B-2 stealth bomber and even the SR-71 spy plane . Thanks to shaping and materials that deflect and absorb radar energy , the F-22 has a radar cross section orders of magnitude smaller than that of the F-15C . Its heat signature and electronic emissions have also been minimized . As a result , it can sneak up on other aircraft and ground installationsthe enemy will remain unaware until the F-22 's missiles , bombs or cannon fire announce its presence . if the enemy does manage to lock onto an F-22 , the next challenge is to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop some 35,000 pounds of thrustmore than any current fighter engine-and give the aerodynamically superclean airplane the ability to cruise at supersonic speeds , without afterburners . In air warfare , speed is survival and the F-22 's " supersonic persistence " means it can penetrate deep into hostile territory and exit quickly , while producing low infrared emissions . Should circumstances warrant , the pilot can also apply afterburners . Officially , the F-22 is a Mach 2class airplane , but its true top-end speed is classified . Electronic Warfare by movie producers to shame . It includes sophisticated phased-array radar and an electronic warfare system that can detect any electronic emissions from the enemy . It also has a datalink to AWACS and other off-board sensors . To process the flood of incoming threat , navigation and aircraft systems data , the F-22 requires a computer that operates at an astounding 9 billion operations a second . Photograph Smart bombs ( above ) and advanced composite materials ( below ) enable the F-22 to deliver an awesome punch . // Since the aircraft is a single-pilot machine , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The pilot is the center of our universe , " one project manager tells POPULAR MECHANICS . The result is a cockpit with a wide-angle head-up display ( HUD ) and a suite of large , fullcolor , head-down liquid-crystal displays that dominate the panel . The main 8-in. - square center screen is the Situation Display and it gives the pilot an overview-often called a " God 's eye " view-of the world around him . Data include his location and that of friendly aircraft . When enemy aircraft are detected , they appear on the screen along with data on their type , range , bearing , altitude , Mach number and closing speed . The on-board computer can automatically prioritize these targets on a shoot list . F-22 wingmen can transfer data between each other 's screens , keeping them on top of the battle while keeping chatter to a minimum . To the right is the Attack Display , which shows the enemy aircraft along with the range envelopes for the F-22 's various missiles . Once a selected target comes within range of the F-22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Attack Display . After missile launch , the display tracks the weapon until it hits or misses . If the aircraft drops from the screen , the pilot presses a button on his sidestick controller to acquire the next target . The screen on the left is the Defense Display . It shows enemy surface-to-air missiles and aircraft , their radar and their missile-range envelopes . And it tracks enemy missiles once they are launched . A fourth screen , positioned below the center primary display , provides aircraft systems data such as fuel status and checklists . Formidable Arsenal Although the F-22 is supposed to avoid close-in air combat , when the time comes for a showdown the airplane should prove to be a mean dogfighter . Not only does it have a high thrust-to-weight ratio and smart avionics , but it also has twodimensional thrust-vectoring nozzles , giving it low speed maneuverability , the key to close-in combat , unprecedented in a high-performance fighter . The thrust vectoring gives the aircraft high roll control even at angles of attack as high as 60deg , enabling the pilot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-stall loss of control . The F-22 pilot has a formidable arsenal at his ( or her ) disposal . The basic air superiority configuration includes two short-range , heatseeking Sidewinders and four medium-range radar-guided air-to-air missiles , plus a 20mm multibarrel cannon-all of which are housed in bays within the airframe 's belly . The aircraft can also carry two 1000-pound bombs internally and be equipped with air-to-ground as well as radar-seeking missiles . Additional weapons are also planned . So , while the fighter may go undetected , its punch will not . As the Air Force 's primary air superiority fighter , the F-22 will be expected to rush to trouble anywhere in the world . Sitting under the spotlights that day in April 1997 , revealed for the first time with its flawless skin , its gray-white presence at once shadowy and potent , the F-22 Raptor seemed equal to the job . " No one is going to want to challenge the F-22 in the air , " said Lt. Col. Scott Anderson of the Air Combat Command .
