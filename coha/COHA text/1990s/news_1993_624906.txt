<p> First came the artists , the free spirits , the adventurous types who fulfill the romantic image of the struggling artist living in a loft . <p> They moved into a few undistinguished , aging brick buildings that were once warehouses and factories on the other side of the tracks , literally , from the Harris County Courthouse and downtown Houston  --  slightly northeast of town just inside Interstate 10 . <p> This anti-establishment advance guard converted dingy , sometimes dilapidated spaces into alternative art galleries , studios and living quarters . Residents of the area , which is usually called simply " " the warehouse district , " seemed to come and go for about a decade , flirting with an idealized vision of living in an old loft . <p> This year , however , with the opening of Dakota Lofts in the old James Bute Paint Factory building at 711 William , loft living appears to be staking a serious , more upscale claim on this tough-looking edge of downtown . Lawyers , journalists and filmmakers are heeding unfulfilled desires to live on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garages and rose gardens into big open spaces with only the bathroom enclosed by walls . <p> While it is n't exactly mainstream , Dakota Lofts does upgrade the neighborhood with extensive renovations that include security gates and doors , basement parking , carpeted and lighted halls , new hardwood floors , complete kitchen areas and large luxury baths . <p> Developer Randall Davis acquired the Bute building in September 1991 and began pre-leasing the 53 lofts last August . <p> Built in 1911 , the updated , four-story brick building opened for occupancy June 1 as Dakota Lofts and was 90 percent leased three weeks later , according to Davis . <p> About half of the new Dakota Lofts residents work downtown , many others work in the Galleria area , and some drive as far as Clear Lake to their jobs . They are all professional people , Davis says , adding that only two are artists . <p> A loft , by one definition , is a space not partitioned off into rooms in any of the upper stories of a warehouse or factory . A loft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your own personality and lifestyle . " That 's what he encourages by providing tenants with unpainted walls , beamed ceilings and open space broken only by the original rough wood columns . <p> The units range from 800 to 1,700 square feet and rent from $ 600 to $ 1,400 a month . <p> Renovating an old building had long been the dream of Davis , a Beaumont native who 's been in Houston and the apartment business almost 20 years . He has submitted a nomination for the Bute building to be designated a historic landmark , and he hopes the city will take measures to encourage the development of downtown living in older districts . <p> In contrast to Dakota Lofts , the mainly unimproved loft spaces in the nearby Houston Studios building at 707 Walnut are definitely do-it-yourself projects . Developer Milton Howe owns the sturdy old brick building that some still call the Jack Pearce Furniture warehouse . Howe 's operations manager , Helen Burns , said she 's heard that the building originally served as a train station for a brief time , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . <p> Burns ' main role , however , is president of Total Video Inc. , a broadcast video production firm that 's a sophisticated fiber optic and transmission facility deep inside the scruffy-looking warehouse . <p> Attached to the north side of the building is the giant Houston Studios sound stage , built in the mid-1980s to attract filmmakers . Many of the interior scenes of RoboCop 2 were filmed in the facility when the movie was being shot in Houston in 1989-90 . <p> Other first-floor commercial tenants range from a small company that builds theatrical scenery to a writer . <p> About 30 second- and third-floor walk-up lofts rent from $ 400 to $ 800 . All but three are occupied . The residents include a computer expert , a photographer , a NASA employee and film producer Gary Chason of Walnut Street Productions . <p> Burns said " " about 30 , " when giving the number of lofts , because the spaces can be reconfigured . " " Originally , these were big , open areas . The first ones to live here drew off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . Most interior walls are corrugated metal on the corridor side , with Sheetrock inside the loft . <p> Two of the available third-floor lofts are best described as " " raw " space , with kitchen and bath facilities in need of renovating , which is left up to renters . <p> One vacant loft features what looks like a small hardwood dance floor in one corner by the big windows , with a view of downtown , and an adjoining wall painted with lavender sky and clouds . <p> Next door , a former resident built in two upper-loft bedrooms , dividing half of the high-ceilinged space into two cramped levels . The next renter can live with it that way or tear it out . <p> Bare bulbs attempt to light the cavernous corridors . Many doors are decorated to demonstrate the residents ' individuality . In one corner , a traditional paneled front door is painted black and surrounded with large black-and-white painted squares . On the adjacent wall , old metal double doors from a bank vault are bolted to the wall . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down several sets of stairs . <p> Other loft spaces are scattered throughout buildings in the neighborhood , many used as home and work space for artistic types who hope the fancier new loft spaces with their higher rent rates wo n't affect their affordable quarters . <p> Davis renovated the open first-floor space of the Dakota Lofts with support for the warehouse district artists in mind . With a striking black-and-white , tile-patterned flooring , adjustable overhead spotlighting and a bar/serving facility , the large lobby can function as an art gallery/party/meeting space . <p> Ron Lott and Gay Anderson moved from a 5,000-square-foot house on three acres in Friendswood into 3,000 square feet in Dakota Lofts in May . They combined two lofts into one sunny , spacious dwelling with two bedroom areas , two large baths , ample closet space and lots of windows giving sweeping views to the east and to downtown on the southwest side . <p> Lott , whose food brokerage firm , Lott Marketing Inc. , is in the Astrodome area , says his reason for the move was simple : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the roof , the pool and all those things . " <p> Anderson said Lott also likes to try things that are different , and moving into a loft is like an adventure for him . <p> " " This fits a guy who 's a businessman by day and a Harley rider by night , " she said . <p> Lott and Anderson are avid collectors and also own quite a bit of traditional and antique furniture . Anderson , who works for Kraft Food Service Inc. , called upon her mother , designer Laqueta Hoffman , to help arrange everything in the wide open space . " " Somehow , this place holds everything we had . I think that by eliminating walls and halls , you almost gain space , " Lott said . <p> There are two distinct seating areas , one formal and one more like a den . The dining table anchors an area between the den corner and the recessed space that 's the guest bedroom . The open kitchen has been expanded , with a peninsula on the side by the entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A wall was added  --  but not a door  --  to give more privacy to the master bedroom area , and Lott finished out the closets and painted the walls . <p> " " I thought it would be really weird living with open spaces and open beams , but I really like it , " Anderson said . " " I feel like we have separate rooms . When we find the right rugs for the different areas and get some pieces reupholstered , it will really add to the feeling of rooms . " By day , when most residents are away at work , a sea of Metropolitan Transit Authority buses is parked in a lot on the south side of the building . Periodic trains rumble by on the nearby tracks , and renovation work continues on the neighboring long , low brick building that will become headquarters for Metro police . <p> By night , however , the buses are parked somewhere else , the trains are infrequent and the lights of downtown dominate the view . <p> It 's city living , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a great place to entertain , " Lott said with anticipation . " " All our friends want to see it . " <p> Even before the first tenants moved into Dakota Lofts , Davis was starting to renovate another old building into lofts . At least he calls them lofts , although it 's stretching the usual description . <p> The 1934 Clarke &; Courts one-story printing factory at 1210 W. Clay , about 10 blocks from the elite River Oaks area , is a pure art deco-design building that housed lithographers , engravers , printers and stationers , according to the original sign over the entrance . Joseph Finger , the architect of City Hall , designed the block-long building with the tall center tower , which Davis says was the first building in the United States with a poured slab . <p> Under Davis ' direction , workers are busy converting the historic building into luxury living spaces with 14-foot ceilings , glass block and brick walls , skylights and fireplaces , whirlpool tubs and double-size slate showers , and large kitchens . Units will be 1,300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 2,100 monthly  --  not exactly lofts for starving artists . <p> Davis has named the project TriBeca Lofts , after the early TriBeCa warehouse lofts that housed food stuffs near the docks in New York . Pre-leasing interest in TriBeca is good , said Davis , who 's already contemplating even loftier goals for urban Houston living . <p> NOTES : Madeleine McDermott Hamm is the Chronicle 's home design editor .
