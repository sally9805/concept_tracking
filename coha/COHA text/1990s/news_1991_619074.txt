<p> John Wickett 's Museum of Exotica is a good place for a nightmare and a bad one to dust . The converted French laundry is equal parts eerie and fantastic . The Addams Family has nothing on the wacky Wickett . <p> The house in lower Pacific Heights is available for parties , either for rent or free , depending on his mood . Guests arrive in costume and are boggled by the decorations . But it is n't done for entertaining . This is the way Wickett lives , at ease on a musty couch with a life-size clown beside him and a stuffed tiger at his feet . <p> " As I get older , I try to have interesting things , " says Wickett , 75 , a retired Peninsula businessman , " so the world comes to me and I do n't have to go out . " <p> FROM EXOTIC TO FUNKY <p> Wickett 's world bridges elegant Middle Eastern and Oriental artifacts with gimmicks from Playland at the Beach , a San Francisco amusement park at Ocean Beach near the Cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only collection that values Laughing Sal , complete with giggle and sway button , equally with a three-foot-wide silver and copper teapot from the Shah 's palace in Iran . <p> Horsehair masks and drums formed from a human skull share space with a clown and elephant from the Playland Fun House , the master bottle mold from the baseball toss and the ballot box from the 1969 Playland Girl contest . <p> " My goal is to achieve organized clutter , " he says . " I 'm getting there . " Particularly in the stuffed animal category . He has mounted heads of moose , polar bear , boar , ram and grizzly bear . He has two stuffed tigers from India and a golden eagle , and the skin of a snow leopard . <p> " How many people " he asks quite proudly , " have hippopotamus and giraffe skins on their ceiling ? " <p> Many artifacts come from Tibet and Bali , two countries he has never visited , though he once stuck his foot in the Indian Ocean off Perth , Australia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . <p> A nook off his living room contains a brass-covered throne and a Chinese empress dowager , carved out of beeswax , with real hair . Another side room is glass-walled and filled with electronic equipment , like an air control tower for charting his parties . He has a carriage house in back and various sleeping lofts , crash pads , hookah huts and hideaways throughout . <p> " I 'm open to parties , corporate events , classes , " he says . " The Japanese are getting awful tired of those bland hotel receptions . " He envisions them bounding off a motorized cable car in front of the Wickett place and giggling at the Playland Mirror Maze and a sign that posts " Back up . You 're in the wrong stall .

" We 're over-decorated as it is . " <p> He does n't know how many items he has . " Just stuff , my props , " he says . " You start counting them , it just goes on and on , into the tens of thousands . " His stuff is crammed into 6,000 square feet , most of which would not be considered livable . Just occupied . <p> " So many people just want the regular deal and I thought , ' Gee , what 's wrong with being different , ' says Wickett , " People have more fun in my house than in a regular old decorated Victorian . " <p> It 's a circus , to be sure , but not like the Menlo Circus Club . Wickett left that lifestyle behind on the Peninsula . He was born into a wealthy New York life insurance family , with homes on both coasts . " I got to admit , " he says , " my parents were well off , too . " <p> He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stanley Hiller , of Oakland 's Hiller Highlands , was the best man at his wedding , and the two went about building separate empires . Soon Wickett had two sons and 14 companies , including a real estate firm holding 4,400 Skyline acres west of Woodside , covering most of King 's Mountain . He claims to have built the largest landholding in San Mateo County . <p> " The most land , " he says , " but far from the most valuable . " <p> THE STAID LIFE <p> From 1948 to 1962 the Wicketts lived the staid Atherton life at Mille Fleur , the former John Sutro estate with a four-story elevator , three guest houses , four acres of lawn , an eight-car garage and a tennis court designed by Bill Tilden . <p> " I used to be as square as they came , " he says . " Ten years on the Cotillion committee . " He was also president of the Redwood City Rotary Club , State Board of Realtors and a founder of the United Way for the Bay Area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his business concerns , between 1962 and 1963 . He sold the John Wickett Co. to Coldwell Banker , and closed the Wickett Lumber Co. , the last sawmill in the county . <p> " I had 14 businesses , ridiculous , " he says in retrospect . " I could never make up my mind which one to go to work at . " So he stopped going to any of them . He was nearing 50 and one of those mid-life crises . <p> " I was very formal , " he says , " but as an old bachelor , I 've kind of gone the opposite way . " <p> In that direction lies a lifestyle that Richard Brautigan would have created , if it did n't already exist . <p> Among Wickett 's prior residences was the old Melvin Belli house , with two 40-foot living rooms , on Twin Peaks . " That 's how I got so famous with the hippies , " he says . " They used to like to come up and play music and watch the sun rise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought an old synagogue on Geary between Bill Graham 's Fillmore West and Jim Jones ' church . He lived there only a year " but my God everything happened . " He got into his own concert business , sponsoring the Who and the Pointer Sisters , among others , he says . Stevie Wonder once sat with him for three hours . " He said , ' You are not uptight . You are nothing but a nice gentleman . ' " <p> OFFBEAT EXISTENCE <p> Wickett settled in his current fun house three years ago . He sleeps in a cramped closet of a loft , up a ladder that would be too steep for most 75-year-olds . " I can run down without touching the banister , " he brags , " with my eyes closed . " <p> His kitchen is set up mostly for opening take-out containers . <p> Whatever wall , counter , ceiling or floor space is not covered by some knickknack or painting is plastered with a Middle-Eastern tapestry or rug . This includes the windows . Sunlight is not a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the video screens . Nor is there a morning workday rush out the door . He lives with a core of friends , guests and hangers-on . <p> " Generally speaking , " he says as a qualifier , " It 's myself and a couple others who help me out . " <p> One guy wears a golf hat with the logo " Kerouac . " The most legitimately employed resident is a light man for the Allman Brothers and Grateful Dead . He draws inspiration for his psychedelic show from life with Wickett . <p> " No one pays rent here , " Wickett says . " They work for me in return . " <p> ' BUYAHOLIC ' <p> The master of the house descends from his loft in the morning and knots a striped tie between a checked flannel shirt and a sheepskin vest . There is no dress code at the current Wickett Company where he has been happily " unemployed for 30 years , " he says . " Now I spend my time fiddling around and holding up my end at auctions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auctions now come to him . <p> " Dealers have caught on to me , " he says . " Hardly a day goes by that the doorbell does n't ring with somebody standing there holding something for me . " <p> He wo n't say how much he has spent . " It 's bad taste , " he says , " like asking a Texan how many cattle he owns . " But he admits to being a " buyaholic , " which indicates most peddlers carry away cash , not the item they brought . <p> " Someone told me I 'm like the church , " he says . " I only acquire . " <p> He has leased a flat next door , which sat vacant for 29 years , to store the junk that is too junky for the main display . This is where he keeps his collection of National Geographic , dating back to 1911 . It may prove useful for research , to further bring the world to John Wickett . <p> MUSEUM OF EXOTICA <p> John Wickett 's Museum of Exotica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyon .
