Section : International ASIA Clinton is eager to negotiate a major strategic understanding with China . But Beijing seems intent on bulling its way into the club of elite nations . <p> WASHINGTON SECRETLY offered China a nuclear deal last month : the Pentagon would not target U.S. missiles at China if Beijing returned the favor . To Bill Clinton 's strategists , it looked like a win-win proposition ; such a deal would shackle an American arsenal far larger than China 's ( at least for the few hours it would take to retarget the warheads ) . And it would ease tensions and help boost good will as the U.S. and Chinese presidents prepared to meet in Manila . But , NEWSWEEK has learned , China said no . Instead , Beijing urged the Americans to offer a unilateral concession by pledging never to use nukes first . But the Pentagon has always rejected dealing away its first-strike capability . The gesture of peace was never made . <p> So begins what is supposed to be an optimistic new chapter in the world 's most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackdown of 1989 , the United States is eager to patch up relations and welcome Beijing to the table of global powers that cooperate with each other . Bill Clinton came into office denouncing the tyrants of Beijing . ' But he would like to go out as the architect of a major new strategic understanding . A State Department spokesman predicted that 1997 will be the most active year for U.S.-China relations of his administration . But the problem , as always , will be to find something the two sides can agree on . <p> Clinton 's sunny state visit to Australia last week , filled with golf and snorkeling , teed up a series of exchanges with Asian leaders over such difficult issues as growing strains between North and South Korea and human-rights abuses in Indonesia . But no issue was so tough , or so fraught with promise , as the relationship with China . And all the new hopes and old doubts about China were on display as U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited Beijing and Shanghai last week . His task was to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Manila , during a meeting this week of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum . Christopher gave none of the lectures on human rights that so infuriated the Chinese during his 1994 visit to Beijing . And he offered his hosts the full-dress summit that Beijing has sought , and Clinton has resisted , since the start of his administration . All the same , there was no sense of any real breakthrough in the air . At the end of the tour , Christopher was scheduled to deliver a major speech on A New Partnership . ' At the last minute  --  after a draft had been distributed  --  he notched the title down to A New Era of Cooperation . ' The idea of a U.S.-China partnership , ' suggested one of his aides , would n't pass the laugh test ' right now . <p> Beijing 's leaders were not laughing . Jiang set a positive tone , telling Christopher that despite some twists and turns , ' bilateral ties have improved in the Clinton years . On issues of substance , however , Jiang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen wined and dined Christopher , he sharply criticized U.S. arms sales to Taiwan , which China considers a renegade province . And although Christopher declared both sides pleased with the recent progress , ' China 's state-run media denounced America for meddling ' in Hong Kong and blocking ' Beijing 's membership in the World Trade Organization . So much for the declarations of good will . The problem is that it 's all a house of cards , ' says a Western diplomat who has dealt with China since 1979 . Sooner or later both sides will see that they disagree on everything . ' <p> Power struggle : China seems to assume that , with an annual average growth rate of 10 percent , it will soon be too big to exclude from the clubs of the elite nations . Its approach to joining the World Trade Organization is a case in point . Beijing has demanded special concessions , including protections for its ailing state industries and the right to ease trade restrictions after joining the WTO , not before . The United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trade reforms , just like other applicants . But Chinese concessions are unlikely , says one Western trade expert , because nobody in the government would dare put them forward . ' The men at the top ca n't afford to look soft during the power struggle over who will succeed the ailing Deng Xiaoping . <p> We 're not prepared to have a detailed debate about what concessions we can make , even internally , ' said a senior Chinese foreign-policy adviser . They 're probing the limits of what they can gain unilaterally , ' says one Western diplomat in Beijing . <p> China 's party line toward the United States began to harden after the missile crisis this March , when Clinton sent two aircraft-carrier battle groups to signal support for Taiwan . Before that , mainland officials had argued that one possible U.S. strategy for dealing with China was to try to contain ' its rise . Now they argue almost unanimously that containment is indeed U.S. policy , despite American assurances to the contrary . Published earlier this year , the popular conservative screed China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shelf full of hot-selling anti-American books . While American and other foreign investors were until recently hailed as auguries of a rich future , they are now routinely criticized for exploiting labor and importing decadence . Just last week rumors of a major new Kodak investment prompted accusations from state-run TV that the American film giant is trying to drive Chinese firms out of business . Even the Clinton administration 's promises to engage ' China in wide-ranging discussions have been interpreted as a threat to engage it in battle . Since America is unwilling to accept China 's rise onto the world stage , ' writes political scientist Jiang Lingfei of the National Defense University in Beijing , there will inevitably be a test of strength . ' <p> This doomsday vision of a fierce struggle is n't merely propaganda ; senior policy advisers have bought into it . One of them compares the new mood to the Mao years  --  when Chinese were indoctrinated to believe a cataclysmic war with the capitalist world was coming . If you 're always saying China Can Say No , ' what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks the adviser . This is not the moment for Jiang to make concessions . ' Many Beijing hard-liners still expect to forge better relations with the United States without giving ground themselves . They see Clinton 's 1994 decision to shelve the threat of economic sanctions against China for its human-rights violations as a sign of weakness  --  and of more American concessions to come . <p> Real leverage : They may be in for a surprise . The Clinton trade team is alarmed that the U.S. trade deficit with China approached $5 billion in September , surpassing even the U.S. imbalance with Japan . And pressure from Congress to balance the budget will push Clinton to seek economic growth through trade agreements , reinforcing hawkish instincts he acquired while trying to open Japan to Arkansas rice and poultry in the 1980s . Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky is likely to get the job permanently , and she is every bit as combative as predecessors like Mickey Kantor , who ruffled Asian allies during Clinton 's first term . Clinton recently joked to aides that Barshefsky is tough enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' In China , Barshefsky was instrumental in cutting a landmark deal designed to stem the pilfering of American CDs , software and other forms of intellectual property . The next task is to enforce the deal , says a senior administration official . We have to get the Chinese to play . ' <p> Clinton still has real leverage . Chinese negotiators are especially eager for Washington to allow American atomic-energy companies to build nuclear plants in China  --  a move that U.S. administrations resisted out of concern that Beijing was passing nuclear technology to U.S. adversaries like Iraq . Last week Christopher announced that Washington would allow such investment under limited conditions , because China had agreed to track exports of nuclear material and technology . In fact , China had made the same promise last November . <p> China will have plenty of chances to continue lobbying . Relations have recovered from the lows of the Taiwan crisis in March . Washington sees the potential for cooperation in several key areas , from nuclear nonproliferation to the effort to defang the military threat from North Korea . China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the coming weeks to help revive military-to-military contacts that faltered after Tiananmen . The Clinton administration plans to send Vice President Al Gore to China , possibly by next March . <p> If all goes well , Clinton might host Jiang on his state visit to Washington sometime next year . The high-profile diplomacy would boost Jiang 's effort to consolidate his political power at home . The Chinese leaders also seem convinced that they will be able to do business with Clinton during his second term . You get to know your opponent best after an argument , ' Prime Minister Li Peng told Christopher last week . That 's step one toward improving U.S.-Chinese relations . But the opponents wo n't become partners as long as Washington regards the Beijing leadership as a bunch of cheaters  --  and as long as Beijing regards the Clinton administration as its special patsy . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ' You get to know your opponent best after an argument ' : The Clintons in Australia <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Jiang 's aides offered little : Christopher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Shanghai , and MATTHEW COOPER with Clinton <p>
