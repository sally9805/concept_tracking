<p> Five years after John C. Portman Jr. , developer of much of downtown Atlanta and of urban megaprojects worldwide , fended off his lenders and bankruptcy through a massive debt restructuring , he is once again approaching a showdown with his creditors . <p> This time Portman must deal not only with the big banks that poured billions into his massive buildings , but some employees and former employees who hold small stakes in his projects . <p> Portman 's major lenders , who agreed to a five-year debt restructuring plan to avert his bankruptcy in 1990 , have generally come to terms on a second restructuring of his debt because the commercial real estate market has not improved enough to enable Portman to meet his debt payments as scheduled . <p> However , the new plan requires 100 percent approval by all creditors - including the small unsecured ones who are his present and former managers and executives who received their interests as compensation from Portman Cos . The plan requires that they sell their stakes . Some are seeking more cash than they 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fired or laid off as the company was diminished over the last five years . <p> Under the proposed restructuring , the banks would swap their unsecured debt for majority ownership in Portman 's downtown trade mart complex made up of the gift , apparel and merchandise marts . <p> Deal in the works for 18 months <p> But patience is growing thin among the big lenders , who 've been laboring over this second plan for about 18 months . <p> After years of forbearance , these banks want the new plan approved by late August . If the plan is not approved by all his creditors , some of the banks do not rule out the possibility of a Portman bankruptcy filing . <p> Portman denies there is a problem , but added , " That does n't mean somebody is not going to exploit this from the standpoint of trying to sue . . . threatening to sue . " <p> He speaks optimistically , estimating the deal to restructure his debt will be completed within 30 to 60 days . <p> In a lengthy interview last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was constrained by lenders in what he could say . <p> He was wary of making some comment that might affect ongoing negotiations , he said . <p> " It 's a long tedious process , but the concept has been approved and we are moving toward finalizing that concept . When that happens , then this saga will be over and we will move on to another saga . " <p> And while he would n't give any details about the next saga or reveal much about the present one , he spoke with quiet intensity about downtown Atlanta , where his career has been focused for more than 40 years , and the state of the commercial real estate industry at large . <p> " Even Rockefeller Center goes bankrupt , " Portman pointed out as he sat in a plant-shrouded niche of the food court at Peachtree Center , the massive complex he built but was you something ? " he asked rhetorically . " This is going on all over the country . It 's not John Portman 's problems . It 's global . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for large commercial projects such as his , " There are no financings . . . in the traditional nature of real estate in the U.S. today , " he said . " We have canvassed the world , believe me . " <p> The 40 institutions worldwide that bankrolled Portman 's debt , which exceeded $ 2 billion at its peak in 1990 , include such notables as First National Bank of Chicago , Citicorp , Swiss Bank , Mellon Bank , Banque Paribas and Fuji Bank . <p> Over the past three years they have consistently eased the schedule for his debt repayment that was established in the original restructuring plan . It called for Portman to sell and refinance enough properties to come up with $ 20 million in June 1992 , $ 40 million in June 1993 and $ 140 million by next Friday . <p> At the time the schedule was set , " It was based on certain refinancings we all agreed were reasonable , " Portman said . " We all felt strongly the economy was going to come back after the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital market would come back . It always has . Since the ' 70s it has always come back . " <p> However , given the drought of funds for real estate and the recession of the early 1990s , " there was no way on God 's green earth we could meet the schedule , so the schedule was amended , ' Portman said . <p> New company would be set up <p> Basically the second debt restructuring plan will set up a new company that owns and operates the apparel , gift and merchandise marts , the trade mart complex in downtown Atlanta where manufacturers and their representatives sell their wares to retail buyers . <p> The banks that now hold unsecured debt in the Portman organization will swap that debt for a total of 82.5 percent ownership in the new company . Portman , his family and related interests will own 17.5 percent . <p> After three or four years , when the mart operating company has a track record , it could go public . Whether the banks could sell their stock in private transactions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue managing the marts , wants that restriction so he will have more time to bring in new investors . <p> There are also some pending issues related to the naming and vetoing of the board of directors and management , and Portman 's salary . <p> The original restructuring plan provided him annual compensation of $ 700,000 to $ 1.4 million , depending upon the amount of his wife 's income . <p> One Peachtree Center debt <p> In a separate transaction completed in May , the debt on One Peachtree Center was restructured . <p> Opened in 1992 , the 60-story tower , along with the Atlanta Gift Mart , comprised Portman 's largest ever construction program in Atlanta and was intended to be the crowning glory of Peachtree Center . Unfortunately , he launched the projects just as the economy headed into recession . <p> Determined to build the tower in a declining market despite less than 40 percent preleasing of office space and heavy competition from other new towers , Portman took on high debt . He got a $ 300 million construction loan from Citicorp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a bridge-to-equity loan that was designed to be sold off to investors . <p> In May , the construction debt was restructured , leaving the building with a first mortgage of $ 175 million and a second priority loan of $ 154 million . <p> " Restructuring the financing was in the best interest of the bank and our best interest , " said Portman . " The building is over 80 percent leased . It is out of harm 's way . " <p> The deal that got One Peachtree to that point came in April when SunTrust , which had been courted by Portman for several years , leased several floors at a bargain rent and got the right to put the name SunTrust Plaza on the building . <p> The effective annual rental rate on SunTrust 's 15-year lease is about $ 11 a square foot for four floors , according to court records of the restructured debt . SunTrust said it is leasing a total of nine floors . <p> That recent lease compares with an effective annual rental rate of almost $ 28 a square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reavis &; Pogue , the documents showed . Jones , Day , which is Portman 's law firm , was among the first tenants signed up for the building in the late 1980s . <p> The documents do not indicate how the effective rents are calculated , but Portman indicated that they were not calculated on the same basis for all tenants . " The effective rent reflects the base cost to tenant , " he said . " Some tenants pay all tenant finish costs and utilities ; others do not . . . All leases are at the market rate at the time they are signed . " <p> One Peachtree Center will continue to be owned by the private partnership that he established to build it , Portman said . His organization manages the building . <p> Remaining holdings <p> After the mart company is set up , the remainder of his real estate holdings will go into a second company that will be owned by him and related interests , Portman said . He declined to disclose what those second company holdings will include . <p> Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide empire before it was whittled away by creditors . <p> Shortly after the beginning of his 1990 crisis , triggered by a cash shortage , Portman was forced to turn over much of Peachtree Center to Equitable and Nippon Life , which held a $ 332.6 million mortgage on the complex . <p> About the same time , he gave up control of Inforum , the technology mart he built in a joint venture with Equitable . <p> It took a year for Portman and his dozens of lenders to devise the original debt restructuring plan that put the mart complex and his minority interests in varied holdings worldwide , and his Atlanta and Sea Island homes into a collateral pool . <p> Some holdings , such as buildings at Riverwood and Northpark Town Centre in suburban Atlanta , were later turned over to lenders and partners . <p> Under that plan , Portman 's organization was directed to focus on fee business such as architectural services and abandon development that would generate more debt . <p> His firm , which has offices in Shanghai , China , and Hong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . <p> In April , Portman announced contracts to participate in the design of a 3.2 million-square-foot mixed-use complex and a 1.6 million-square- foot , 60-story tower , both in Shanghai , and to provide master planning for the central business district in a new town planned near Jakarta , Indonesia . <p> Last year Portman participated in the design of four Shanghai projects , the largest being a 2.6 million-square-foot office-residential- retail complex named New Asia Center , and of a hotel and convention center in Jinan , China . The firm also was commissioned to design Ever Fortune Plaza in Hanoi , Portman 's first venture into Vietnam , and it designed a 500-room luxury hotel planned in Monterrey , Mexico . developed Properties that John Portman turned over to lenders : 1 .
