" I really do n't feel that I 've lost her , " says Lyle Lovett , Roberts 's estranged husband . " We are very close . " // Almost 30 , Julia Roberts leaves glum-and-glummer roles behind and rediscovers the pretty woman within In Hollywood-Let 's face it-She has earned a repkutation as a pretty difficult woman . Julia Roberts clashed with Nick Nolte during 1991 's I Love Trouble and created such a fuss making 1991 's Hook that the crew nicknamed her Tinkerbell . So when the actress grabbed a bullhorn at the end of one long , hot day of shooting her new hit movie . My Best Friend 's Wedding , in Chicago last summer , some coworkers braced themselves for a dose of divaesque behavior . Instead , Roberts called out " happy birthday ! " to a crew member . " It was so cute ! " recalls extra Bonnie Deutsch . " And then she turned to the audience , and she thanked them for supporting us and letting us tie up all the traffic . Everybody just thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to thank you . We know this is a hassle for you , but we 're thrilled to be here . ' " Even now , Wedding director P.J. Hogan remains amazed at how the 5 ' ' 9 " beauty rubbed elbows with the City of Big Shoulders . " She was , " he says , " the hottest thing to hit Chicago since the fire . " But Julia Roberts has always been hot . What 's new is the warmth that , from all appearances , pervades her personality . The woman who once had rocky affairs with Liam Neeson , Jason Patrick and assorted other leading men has become a more serene and secure Julia , one very different from the reclusive star who took the part of Dr. Jekyll 's maid in the grim 1996 box office bomb Mary Reilly , then locked herself in her London apartment to hide from the paparazzi . Maybe she has just matured , but with her 30th birthday looming on Oct. 28 , Roberts has been out and about more , making friends with strangers while walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar top and generally exhibiting an intriguing mixture of sanity and sass . Robert 's decision to do Wedding shows that after several years of increasingly questionable career choices ( Mary Reilly , Michael Collins , Ready to Wear ) , she has learned to lighten up and return to the sexy , funny roles that turned the once-gawky girl from Smyrna , Ga. , into a star . Pitching the film to theater owners at the ShoWest convention in Las Vegas last March , Roberts pleaded , " My hair is a lovely shade of red and very long and curly the way you guys like it ; for the love of God , please see this movie ! " Roberts 's three homes-she has a duplex apartment in New York City , a 50-acre retreat in Taos , N.Mex. , and a house in the Hollywood Hills-are calmer , happier places these days . One possible steadying influence : her mother , Betty Motes , whom she sees frequently . And two years after their March 1995 separation , her friendship with Lyle Lovett is closer than ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked for dates with handsome young swells in Manhattan and L.A. , she has apparently rid herself of the impulsive streak that led to a hastily canceled wedding with Kiefer Sutherland in 1991 and a hastily arranged one with Lovett two years later . // A In My Best Friend 's Wedding ( with Diaz and Mulroney ) , Roberts " has everything that everyone likes , but better , " says costar Rupert Everett . // Make no mistake : Roberts remains very much the Movie Star . She maintains a whippet-thin body ( thanks to regular running , even when she 's facing 18 hours on a set ) and pals around with industry players such as her agent Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas , who gets Roberts $12 million a picture . Yet the actress no longer plays the on-set prima donna . " Julia 's smile , " says Wedding costar Dermot Mulroney , " is like a thousand-watt bulb . Everybody falls for it , but there 's nothing like it when she smiles and laughs . You ca n't help but be drawn into it .

She promised to come back the next day . " Yeah , right , " Meier recalls thinking .

The grace and charm , though , have been slow to come . Roberts became a superstar at an age when the average college kid is still picking out that first suit for job interviews . " Julia was a baby then , " says Maggie Wilde , who was Richard Gere 's producing partner when Pretty Woman ( 1990 ) was made . " It 's a little unfair , people saying , How come she did n't stay 21 ? ' You know , like . . . how come she did n't stay a virgin ? " Still , Wedding producer Jerry Zucker says that , for Roberts , growing up in public has had a plus side . " Because she 's been in an adult world for so long and has had to respond to major pressures , " says Zucker , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her years . You expect her to be 40 now , like it 's time for her to play mothers or something . " That 's a role Roberts is n't rushing into . " If I 'm married when that happens , terrific . If I 'm not , well , that 's fine too , " she told London 's Sunday Telegraph . " There 's nobody in particular in her life , " says a friend , " yet there are a lot of people vying for the opportunity . " Since her split from Lovett , Roberts briefly dated Matthew Perry for a couple of months early last year after her guest shot on Friends , which aired in January 1996 . ( " I love a man who can fax me five times a day , " she told him in a saucy note reported by Redbook . ) After Perry , she went out with New York City celebrity fitness trainer Pat Manocchia , 35 , for several months . The pair , says a source close to Roberts , are friends but no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big part of her life , although he denies reports that they are an item again . " Julia and I are very close , " the singer says , " and we do see each other socially . " The two are often spotted in each other 's company , and Lovett has reportedly visited her at her spread in Taos-where she has tooled around in a 1965 VW bug . And he still calls her mother Mom . " Julia and Lyle 's relationship was based on something true and real , " says a friend , " and that will always be there . " Both Lovett and Manocchia attended the New York premiere party for Wedding on June 17 , but Roberts 's escort was openly gay costar Rupert Everett , who plays her gay pal in the film 's star-making role . At home in Manhattan , Roberts is " a cross between Martha Stewart and a bohemian beatnik , " says one pal . " She 'll invite you to her apartment for a home-cooked meal with homemade bread and turkey and all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neruda and discussing art . " Roberts even knits sweaters for friends and teaches needlework to colleagues such as Wedding costar Cameron Diaz . Her sister Lisa , 32 , is one of her best friends , and she adores her 6-year-old niece Emma , the daughter of Kelly Cunningham , the ex-girlfriend of Julia 's actor brother Eric Roberts , whom Julia has n't spoken to since the two parents feuded over custody in 1993 . Although Roberts 's mother , Betty , a real estate agent , still lives near Atlanta , Julia is devoted to her and gave her a blinkand-you'll-miss-it , nonspeaking part as a brunch guest in Wedding .

" // Roberts 's one constant traveling companion , however , is Diego the dog . While she was shooting Wedding , he stayed at Chicago 's Citizen Canine , the swank doggy bed-and-breakfast where Oprah Winfrey sometimes keeps her six golden retrievers and two cocker spaniels . According to " innkeeper " Steve Malone , Roberts brought " regular old , basic dog food " for Diego-unlike some celebs , who request everything from Mexican eats to Chinese takeout for their pets ' pampered palates . And Roberts , says Malone , " waited in line like everybody else . She did n't expect any star treatment . " These days , Roberts is letting her hair down . Boozers at a Manhattan honky-tonk called Hogs &; Heifers last September looked up from their longnecks to find her boogeying on the bar and shucking off her 34B Maidenform from beneath her shirt-in accordance with the establishment 's freewheeling tradition .

" Photograph A On the set of Conspiracy 7 ' ( with Mel Gibson ) , Roberts made a script suggestion that helped a flawed scene . Photograph " I do n't think she likes being on display , " a friend says of Roberts ( with Gere in Pretty Woman ) . " She would rather be at home . " Photograph A " This role does not call for any ounce of glamor I could ever possess , " Roberts proudly said of Mary Reilly . // Wedding , which earned $21.7 million in its opening weekend , topping Sleepless in Seattle 's record for romantic comedies , seems made-to-order for the suddenly centered star .

Later this summer , Roberts ( minus her curly tresses ) will be out promoting the thriller Conspiracy Theory with Mel Gibson . That shoot also reflected the new Julia , degenerating at times into a practical joke-off : Gibson sent Roberts a gaily wrapped dead rat-and she responded by Saranwrapping his dressing-room toilet . At that film 's wrap party in an L.A. nightclub on Feb. 8 , Roberts got onstage and danced with abandon to the beat of the Funky Hippez . And the future ? Despite talks , a Pretty Woman sequel has never come to fruition , but a source close to Roberts says she may reteam with Richard Gere next spring for a suspenseful romance called Manhattan Ghost Story . That film would shoot after she costars with her close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an as-yet-untitled drama in which Sarandon 's character , who is dying , teaches her ex-husband 's new girlfriend ( Roberts ) how to raise her children .

A friend says that every time Sally Struthers pleads for orphans on TV , " Julia gets a pen and writes down the address . " Everett predicts that Roberts , who spent six days touring Haiti in 1995 on behalf of a literacy project , will become a leader of UNICEF , following in the footsteps of the late Audrey Hepburn . " Just wait and see , " Everett says . " When she 's 50 , she 'll have her shirtsleeves rolled up , and she 'll be scrubbing babies in Calcutta . " But in between movies , her fans hope .
