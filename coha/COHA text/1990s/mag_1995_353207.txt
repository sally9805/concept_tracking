For the second time in 10 days , a man in a white surgical mask terrified Japan . This time the target of the mysterious assailant was carefully picked : Takaji Kunimatsu , chief of the country 's 220,000-strong police force and the man in charge of investigating the deadly poison-gas attack in Tokyo 's subway . <P> Kunimatsu was right on schedule when he left his apartment last Wednesday morning , just after 8:25 . As usual , he took the elevator down to the lobby , met his aide and started to walk across the tiled entry toward his chauffered car . At that moment , a gunman hiding behind a utility pole opened fire with a .38-cal. pistol . <P> Police believe the shooter was a professional . He had studied Kunimatsu 's movements and chosen his time carefully . But it was the assailant 's marksmanship that most clearly separated his act from that of a rank amateur . At a distance of more than 65 ft. , he fired four times and did not miss once , putting bullets through Kunimatsu 's leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground . Then the gunman hopped on a bicycle and disappeared . <P> It took six hours of surgery before doctors could pronounce Kunimatsu in stable condition . They say the police chief will survive the shooting , although his recovery will take weeks . What may prove far more difficult to repair is Japan 's proud sense of itself as a nation immune to the sort of violence and fear that the Japanese associate with America , not their own homeland . <P> The attempt to murder Kunimatsu , coming so quickly after the subway gas attack that killed 10 and injured 5,500 , struck at the very symbol of social stability in Japan . Not since the Japanese Red Army terrorized the country in the early 1970s has there been such a brazen challenge to authority in postwar Japan . Says Takeo Mori , professor of criminal psychology at Senshu University : " Anyone can do it anytime , and therein lies the fear . ' ' <P> So far , there are few clues and even less hard evidence to suggest who might be responsible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aum Shinrikyo , the apocalyptic cult whose messianic leader , Shoko Asahara , has eluded a nationwide police hunt since the subway attacks two weeks ago . Although no legal proof links Aum to either case , the circumstantial evidence is mounting dramatically . <P> Shortly after the shooting , anonymous callers telephoned TV stations to warn that more police officials would be harmed if the investigation of Aum was not called off . But if the assault was meant to intimidate authorities , there were no signs of anyone backing off . All week investigators continued to dig into the cult 's compounds in a rural village near Mount Fuji . According to a police spokesman , the investigators were gathering evidence that sect leaders planned to make poison gas " in preparation for murder , ' ' the closest that authorities have come to implicating Aum . Police unearthed tons of suspect chemicals , drugs and apparatuses and came close to uncovering evidence that the killer nerve gas may have been made on the premises . They discovered a large and elaborate laboratory hidden behind an inner admitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
