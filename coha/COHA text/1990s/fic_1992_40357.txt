MENDING HEADS <p> Dr. Benjamin Natheniel turned the envelop over and studied the return address . She had n't been sure . If she had been sure , she would have written before she went overseas . <p> He slopped the note out of the envelop and read it again . She was coming through Boston on her way back from a conference in Yugoslavia . She wanted to come out to Newton and see him . <p> It was n't unusual for him to hear from former patients and students . They called when they were coming through Logan , they came to his lectures when he was in their town , they drove across country on impulse - to see an old friend . The tie between an analyst and his patient was a strong one . You told things to your analyst you did n't tell to your lover , or your husband , or your wife , or the taxi driver in Toledo , or the beauty operator in the Bronx . And it was the same with analytic students . <p> He returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box next to the statue on his desk , and leaned back in the leather chair he had sat in for forty years , listening to the stories of others . He had n't expected to hear from one of them . It had n't been a good ending . <p> He sat there thinking until he heard the taxi pull into the driveway . He got up , and went to the attic window ; watched her pay the driver , and look around . Her eyes focused on the For Sale sign planted in the front yard . He was moving down to the Cape , permanently . His son , Steven , who had taken over the practice , preferred to see patients in a downtown office . The days of sharing your home with the people you helped were long gone . <p> He stepped back into the shadows as she looked up to the window . She was his age . The age he had been when they worked together in the sixties . He ran his hand through his white hair and smiled ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norman Mailer . He moved to his office door , as his secretary let her in . <p> " Nice to see you , " he said , extending his hand as she reached the top of the stairs , " Come in . " <p> There was a quick moment in which they both recognized how much older they were , and then that mysterious return to the way they had been when they last saw each other . He had seen it in other patients and students when they came back ; felt in it himself , a reaching back behind the years they had not shared for the old connection , and then a drive to bring the tie forward , into the present . <p> " Coffee ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> He watched her survey the room while he fixed the coffee . Watched her eyes bypass the analytic couch , and move to the alcove where he had conducted his student seminars late at night after the daily consultations had been completed and the patients seen . They had often stayed until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients , about their own struggles with the knowledge of the mind he had given to them . <p> He had taken psychiatry out of academia and medical offices and into the streets during the sixties , and they had gone with him . They had gone with him into the police departments , into the welfare offices , into the massive mental institutions , into the schools , into politics . They would change the system . Make the wisdom of psychiatry available to everyone , not only to those who could pay for sanity . They would nip new diseases of the mind ; eradicate old prejudices . Even after Kennedy died , the excitement continued . <p> " You still have it , " she said , sitting down in the chair in front of his desk , and reaching forward to touch the black figurine centered in front of her , but facing him . <p> " What ? " he asked , momentarily distracted by picking up the coffee cups . <p> " The Koshin-Sama . " <p> He stood with the coffee cups , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NO EVIL . HEAR NO EVIL . NO EVIL . Her fingers stopped at the broke neck of SEE NO EVIL . <p> He placed the coffee in front of her , and went around the desk to his chair . <p> " Nice trip from Yugoslavia ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " What did you give your paper on ? " <p> " What did you give your paper on ? " <p> " Sadness . " <p> He leaned forward . " Unusual conference topic . " <p> " Yes , so they told me . Usually they talk about depression . " <p> " How did you come to decide on sadness ? " <p> " Because it 's the terminal stage of mourning , the knowing what was behind the depression . " <p> " And accepting ? " <p> " That has n't come yet . " <p> " It 's been a long time . Could that have anything to do with why you 're here ? " <p> The old rage soared into her face , but it was gone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last time he saw her . It had grown deeper and wilder as he defended himself against her accusations , like the New Jersey street fighter he might have become if he had n't gone into medicine . He had forgotten his analytic role that day . He had forgotten about the objective distance that Frequd has insisted on . He had forgotten about maintaining objective closeness and objective distance long before that day . They had idolized him : as patients always idolize their analysts , and young students their teachers . And he had accepted their idolatry . But it was more than that . The times were idealistic , and the knowledge he had developed was overwhelming in its power . Dr. Benjamin Nathaniel was making the wisdom of psychiatry accessible to ordinary people : allowing them to incorporate it into their lives and learn from it , without bending to the shameful stigma of mental illness . Even the academics who pushed him out of his teaching position at Harvard , acknowledged that . <p> He watched her study the Koshin-Sama . She was not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Where did you go when you left Boston ? " <p> " Baltimore . " <p> " You married ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Still ? " <p> " I 'm a widow . " <p> " I 'm sorry . And Ron ? " <p> " He went to Australia . They put a steel plate in his head . He works on a ranch in the Outback . He ca n't think abstractly . He ca n't conceptualize . " <p> " Rachel ? " <p> " Toronto . They only saved her right eye . " <p> A researcher had called him from Sixty Minutes a few years ago . Sixty Minutes was trying to locate students who had left the country after the sixties , to do a story . He had n't given any information . <p> " Are you in contact with Ron and Rachel ? " <p> " No , but I always know where they are . You could have stopped it . You know you could have . " <p> There they were . The exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You wrote a book about us . A bestseller . Bet you paid a lot of money in taxes that year . Got your name on a few missiles ? " <p> He controlled himself from responding to the nastiness ; seeing the old lines of betrayal in her face . <p> " Did you read the book ? " <p> " Are you kidding ? " <p> He had hoped they would read it . He had assumed responsibility in the book . All the royalties had gone to the Massachusetts Mental Health Association . <p> He shifted in his chair and allowed his mind to wander back to that night on the Commons . Joan Baez was singing . The universities has just opened for the fall term . It was the first rally . He had been invited to sit on the stage . They had come from all over New England . They filled the Commons , spilled over to the steps of the Capital , sat on the streets of Beacon Hill . <p> He had told himself it was because of Catherine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they took off Catherine 's second breast . Catherine had n't wanted him to go to the rally . The moment Joan Baez left for the airport , he had left himself , and walked over to Massachusetts General . He had heard the sirens in the background as he walked along the Charles , but he had n't stopped . He had n't gone back . <p> " You could have stopped if , if you had been there , " she was telling him again . You knew the Police Commander and the policemen , If you ' d been there and taken the microphone , they would n't have hit us . We were n't doing anything . Rachel and I were just girls . Ron was a mere boy . " <p> He remembered being unable to look at the newspaper pictures of the clubbings . He had n't asked her that last day if she , too , had been hit . <p> " Did they club you ? " <p> " Of course , you ought to know that . They clubbed me twenty-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept my arms over my face , so they would n't club me in the eye . That 's where they wanted to club you , in the eye . And I counted . Every time they hit me , I counted . When they clubbed me the first time , I counted 11111111 , until they clubbed me the second time , then I counted 22222222 , and the third time 33333333 , and the fourth 44444444 . I counted so my head would n't shatter when they clubbed me . Ron did n't count . Rachel forgot to keep her arm over her eye . " <p> She was leaning forward in the chair , bringing the old terror back to him as well as to herself . Ninety-eight percent of the human race would have believed it was because of Catherine . That he had innocently walked away from the rally he had organized , to be with his dying wife . They would have wanted to believe that too . But they would have known it was n't true . He had taught them too much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to understand it , to recognize that there were no coincidences in life , that every act was a decision no matter what the fear that led to it , that every contact bore a complementary purpose . <p> He waited , sensing that she had n't come back only to accuse him again . She put out her hand and touched the Koshin-Sama . The last time he had seen her , she had picked up the statue , aimed it at his head , turned , and flung it into the fireplace . It was then that " SEE NO EVIL " had been decapitated . <p> " Funny how things come together , " he said , opening his desk drawer and removing a small black object . " I found this last week when I was packing . " <p> She put her hand out and took the head of SEE NO EVIL . <p> " Must be glue around here somewhere , " he said , rummaging further in the drawer . <p> She took the glue from him , studied the head for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached the head of SEE NO EVIL to its body . <p> " It 's not like that , " she said . <p> " Not like what ? " <p> She did n't answer . He waited , but nothing came . <p> " What happened after the clubbing ? " <p> " I forgot about it . No , it was that I could n't remember . I went to Baltimore , lived a normal life , worked . " <p> " And ? " <p> She touched the head , testing to see if the glue had dried . <p> " After my husband died , I started to remember . " <p> " You stayed in Baltimore ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Where did you go ? " <p> " To the North . To the Arctic . To Bethel on the Kuskokwim River . " <p> " What did you do there ? " <p> " Stayed alive . " <p> " That was the task ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " What was Bethel like ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitting them with invisible clubs up there , for the oil . " <p> " How are the Eskimos handling it ? " <p> " They drink when the white man 's around . " <p> " And when he 's not ? " <p> " Some of them go into the time of the Dorset . " <p> He shifted forward in his chair . <p> " Into the darkest of the dark ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " And you went with them ? " <p> " Not at first . At first I only walked along the Kuskokwim . Once I walked all the way to the Bering Sea . " <p> " Eventually you went with them ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> Her eyes were twitching . <p> " But you came back . " <p> " I did n't think I would . " <p> " But you did . " He was smiling . <p> Her eyes were still twitching . <p> " It 's not like that , " she said , picking the Koshin-Sama up from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to see evil , and hear it , and say it . " <p> " Before you can choose ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " That 's what it means . Once you 're gone into the darkness , you can handle it . " <p> " It was n't easy . " <p> " Now you can forgive ? " <p> " Yes . " Her eyes twitched faster , racing ahead of something that was coming through , trying to hold it in , stop it . He know it was the critical moment . without moving he brought himself forward , closer to her , telling her it was o.k . <p> " One of us could have taken the microphone too , " she stammered , her lips continuing to tremble after the words were out . <p> " Yes . " <p> He walked with her out of the curb , to wait for the cab . As it pulled into the driveway , they shook hands , knowing they would never see each other again . <p> Article copyright Governors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State University and Helen Hughes . <p>
