They were two hard-working people , two humble souls who had labored themselves thin and tough and moderately content . And now they had worked their way to a farm that was old and gray , as worn out as they were . There would be a lot to patch together , big things and little things . To be done kind of gradually . A farm to keep you busy . <p> " Well , there is one thing , you know , " said the real estate agent : " There 're some rats . Farm like this , right ? Stands empty a couple of years . Almost ca n't be helped . " <p> No , of course , they understood . It was only natural . He should n't give it another thought . After all , they 'd seen rats before , and then of course there were certain measures they could take . <p> " Yeah , is n't that right ? There are measures , are n't there ? " the real estate agent said with relief . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> If only they had helped . <p> The business with the rats was n't the way they had imagined it . They had expected a little bit of everything and figured that there were a lot of them , maybe a whole lot  --  two years is a long time  --  they were prepared . But not prepared enough . As soon as they moved in , they realized how things stood . It was a veritable rat farm . There were n't " a lot " of them , there was a nation of them . A nation of thousands , teeming , inconceivable . They were everywhere , every hour of the day or night , and they did n't even try to hide or even get out of the way when anyone met them . They were n't in the least people conscious . It soon got to be too much for Daniel , the husband , and he would angrily grab a brick or his wooden clog and fling it at them . And then the rats would move for the sake of appearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would continue their protracted , languid trotting , unimpressed , or they would stop short for a moment and turn their repulsive little snouts toward him in an astonished , idiotic grimace , as if they were surprised that he was still there , this foolish , pig-headed person who did n't seem to want to understand what kind of a farm this was . And they would jog on resignedly with their tails twitching . <p> Daniel gave them poison , but they did n't seem to notice . He found a couple of isolated limp gluttons , but that was all . Then he tried gas cartridges , but they were n't much better . Yes , he did find a few corpses , but it did n't help . There were too many rats . <p> In their despondency , it seemed to them that the beasts had gotten a contemptuous , mildly irritated look about them . They felt very tired and had a hard time coping with the terror that the rats constantly exposed them to . They could n't open a door without running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panels , or just sitting there with their gimlet eyes fixed on them . Everything disintegrated before their eyes , the candles in the candelabra on the chest of drawers , the soap in the tin saucer under the kitchen window , the bread in the pantry cupboard . If they walked through a door in the dark , they risked slipping on the flabby bodies of rats that could n't be bothered to move . At night they could n't sleep because the brutes were banging around everywhere , even in the bedroom itself . They could n't feel safe in their beds . They would occasionally wake up and find rats sitting between them on the pillow or running , squealing in annoyance , across the down quilts . It took a real toll on them , and in the end , they could n't enjoy anything . These terrible , gloating creatures that were increasingly intent on getting rid of the tiresome humans hissed , spit , and scuttled after them everywhere . <p> One day , Martha , the wife , said , as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when talking to each other , " Maybe a cat might help . " <p> " A cat , did you say ? " he replied vacantly . " How could a cat help ? There is n't anything that 'll help . " <p> " Yes there is , one of those ratters . We could try , you know . " <p> Of course they could try . He agreed to do it . It probably would n't hurt anything . <p> So they got a cat , a ratter , as they had decided to do . A monstrosity of a cat , huge and ugly . Daniel looked at it with his small dry eyes that were as dull as pale sand . Would it be able to hold its own ? Against a nation like this ? He felt its paws , but the cat pulled them back coolly . They were as big as a lion 's . It would need them . <p> In the beginning it simply walked around the farm as if it were getting its bearings . It was noiseless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went . The rats were startled when they saw it . Then they wiggled their heads and shook off this strange sight . Ts-ts-ts ! They looked as if they considered the cat to be even more foolish than the husband and wife . Their long whiskers bristled in pity . Ts-ts-ts ! Poor demented cat . Ts-ts-ts ! <p> But once the cat felt ready to begin its work , everything changed . <p> If the rats hardly saw it before , now they caught its scent from great distances . There was an infinite , tired displeasure in their eyes when they ran into it or saw it striding along the walls of the house . If they managed to see it at all . It had begun to fall on them in the most unexpected places , pouncing on them without a sound and biting them to death in one brief , dispassionate snap . It did n't play with them , much less eat them . It left them to lie ignominiously where it had grabbed them or else dragged them out into the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rats nervous , and they gradually lost some of their arrogance . Now , when Daniel threw something at them , he would often hit them . They were n't themselves anymore . They were still a nation , but a nation in decline , showing all the signs of degeneration . At last , things reached the point where they apathetically let themselves be murdered , hardly even trying to save themselves . They had accepted their fate and surrendered in the face of the cat 's cold persistence . They were n't accustomed to fighting for their lives ; there had always been too many of them . <p> Daniel and Martha began to cheer up . They were very pleased with their cat . <p> They made sure not to get sentimental about the cat or to demand affection from it . It was short-tempered and had no pleasures aside from killing . They let it take care of itself , fed it , and were quietly grateful . In an attempt to show appreciation for its zeal , Martha gave it a treat a few times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed no enthusiasm , devouring it all with no more excitement than the daily lumps of bread . Slightly offended , she stopped the treats . She happened to stroke it across the back of its head a single time . It glanced curtly at her , then bit her finger . The cat was n't interested in that sort of thing . At least now she knew it . <p> One evening they saw a sight they would never forget . A sight that brought them back to life . <p> An endless , monotonous , gray line of rats was streaming out of the farmyard , out onto the road , where it disappeared into the evening shadows . The rat nation was fleeing , but listlessly , broken and miserable . They stood and watched the rat nation file past for an hour . <p> As they were going inside , they caught sight of the cat , sitting with red-hot eye-slits in a wheelbarrow in the middle of the yard . It looked fixedly out into the gray night fog , straight as a pillar with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distant ridges . <p> They hunched their shoulders and went inside , in to a night 's sleep without rats . <p> The next day they realized the cat was no longer there . Now that nothing remained for it to do , the cat had left them , just like that . They were n't sorry . There was something ominous about the cat . They were satisfied with its work , but they did n't really understand the animal . It was n't a normal cat . They felt as if they had been given a reprieve when they discovered it had left . <p> They did n't talk about the cat once it was gone . They worked and were reasonably pleased with the farm that they were fixing up little by little . They lived the way they had thought life should be lived . In complete serenity . <p> Early one morning in the late fall , there was an insistent noise outside . They were awake but lay still as if not wanting to admit they 'd heard anything . They realized very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They expected to hear the noise again , but it did n't come . Once was enough . Well , all right . Daniel got up and went outside . <p> It was sitting in the wheelbarrow , just like the last time he saw it . It was as if it had n't moved at all but had been sitting there unnoticed the entire time . It sat with its narrow eye-slits , two yellowish knife blades , aimed at him . He nodded , as if to a person . He put out milk and discovered that there was now one more cat , a female , a deluxe edition of a female , with a coat of light-colored fur and as lithe as a marten . He stood watching them drink . Cats were OK , he was thinking . A farm should have cats , he consoled himself as he stood there . <p> The cats drank until there was n't another drop in the house , and he hoped they would be satisfied . They were . Without looking at him , the cats disappeared into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk out . Of course they could manage that . They kept an extra pail back from the dairy . That did the trick . They would just have to get used to it . <p> They knew that the cat had come to stay and that it had never considered leaving them . They forgot that it had been gone at all . <p> Kittens arrived . Six . <p> People usually drowned those things , so Daniel went up to the hayloft with a sack . The tomcat was sitting at the top of the ladder looking at him . Daniel went back down unobtrusively , mumbling as if he had forgotten something . He felt like a fool but he did n't drown the kittens . Martha did n't say anything , but a tense , tight wrinkle appeared on her brow . <p> The couple stopped using cream in their coffee . Besides , what good did it do , really ? Really , what good did it actually do to drink all that milk ? They started drinking water . When you got right down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew large and sleek . They resembled their mother , but the father 's wild , dangerous look was present in their round eyes like a faint shining ring . They had the kind of paws that you would expect . Daniel did n't look at them and walked around them whenever possible . They lived in a tumultuous family life , these cats did , in the middle of the farmyard they ruled with their turmoil and their unapproachable elegance . Daniel did n't use the wheelbarrow anymore . The cats had taken it over for good . Martha felt a personal joy in watching the big kittens teem and tumble around their mother . She would stand for a whole quarter of an hour at a time , peering at them from her kitchen window , but she did n't say anything about it td Daniel . They never talked about the cats . They did n't really talk very much at all anymore . <p> The kittens grew bigger and bigger and became more like adults . Whenever the sun reached into the farmyard , they flopped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indolent and pretty . At night they fought like the wild animals that , deep inside , they were . Their yowls took Daniel ' s breath away , and he shivered in the clammy , desolate bed and mumbled dark threats . Martha lay beside him , stiff and rigid , looking derisively at the moon . Neither of them slept much , but neither let it show . Hollow-eyed , they avoided each other 's gaze throughout the day . But they did n't do anything to put a stop to the ferocity either . They put up with it , took it . Strangers to each other . without feeling . Not even disdain for the cats that wanted nothing to do with them , would n't let themselves be reasonably placated or socialized with . Martha developed deeper , sharper lines around her mouth . Those cats really should have been drowned , but she did n't say anything . She kept silent . They both kept silent . <p> Meanwhile , cats streamed to the farm . They came from all parts of the parish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They demanded milk , and Daniel poured it out for them . Three pails . Milked and poured , milked and poured . Of course , he tried to pretend that he did n't even see them , ignored his fate , but the tomcat would sit in front of him , slicing through him with its knife blades , and it would n't leave him until he had poured out the milk . If he walked away , it followed very calmly behind until , glowering , he gave in . They only sent one pail to the dairy . One pail  --  for now . <p> For a while he thought about getting a dog , but gave it up . Something told him a dog would n't help . It would be a new defeat . So he walked around defiantly , chewing on the staggering , astonishing notion that of course he could just sell . Pure and simple , just sell the whole thing . Farm and cats as one . He got quietly excited at his selling fantasies , but they were never more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that very well . You do n't sell this kind of a farm just like that . The kind of farm you 'd worked and slaved your way toward all your life . When you 've never owned anything before . Not for the sake of a few cats . Not for the sake of anything . <p> But he could poison them , as if they were the rats that were still infesting the place . Maybe cats were n't as savvy about poison and that kind of thing . Maybe that was the only thing that was right for cats . He could mix it into the milk . It would be easy . <p> He walked around brooding for a few days and then bought a package of poison . He carried it in his arms carefully and solemnly , as if it were an infant . He mumbled and whispered to it and treated it tenderly . A blurry glow settled over his pale eyes when he placed it on a stone support pillar in the barn . He opened it up and sniffed at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder as if he wanted to feel it . It was strangely soft , and it closed gently around the blackened , cracked crook of his finger . It was a poison that could beatify the most degraded heart . Untraceable , colorless , odorless , with not the slightest hint of danger . A noiseless poison , so to speak , a poison fit for cats . <p> Daniel stood there feeling it for a long time , sensing something expanding inside him . He was happy . He stood there becoming charitable toward the world . He could go in to Martha and say something to her . He could do anything at all . A man with a weapon like this , what could hold him back ? <p> He pulled himself together and began to pour milk into a pail . He could n't wait ; he had to mix the poison right away . Happily , he rattled the pail with the milk , splashing it so that it spattered on the cement , where it made long bluish streaks . The pail was full in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stood motionless at a slant with his arm stretched straight out like a wind-blown branch . The tomcat was sitting on the pillar looking him dead in the face . He had n't noticed it before , had n't seen it come in . It was as if it had materialized out of the air , dark and peremptory . He saw the slits and dropped his arm . A branch that has finally been sawed at and suddenly collapses against the truck . He looked apprehensively at the bag that was standing there tilted . One movement , and the cat would knock it down to the pigs inside . He regretted his thoughtlessness and withered beneath the slits ' gaze . At that moment , the bag tipped over . He jumped toward it in icy fear , grabbing , but not fast enough . It landed inside the trough and made a dry cloud . He grabbed a shovel and rushed in to the pigs to drive them away before they got any of it . Sweating and desperate , he wrestled with them in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat backs with the handle of the shovel , turning the blade and pounding at their flanks , straining and gasping from exertion . At last it occurred to him to push the gate open and drive them out . In a swarming , howling torrent the pummeled , unruly pigs surged through the narrow gate , stumbling on their fat , scraped knees , half-skidding on their backs , breaking out into the barn where they thrashed around among tools and the chickens whose squawking turned this chaos of animal voices into a total hell . <p> Back in the sty , Daniel sat holding the split shovel handle and looking groggily at one of the pigs lying stretched out in its own excrement , convulsing . A white ring circled its snout and soft powder spots were scattered around its eyes and large mangy ears . Daniel sat there hating it . Hating it so that he cried , an old man 's numb , feeble sobs through the stubble of his beard . <p> Then he went inside and left the dead pig lying there . The others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disdainfully rooting around in the potato plot and garden . Martha put the plates out without comment . He ate with automatic movements that , in a sense , were too large for him . He sat there crumbling inside . <p> For the rest of the day , he lay down . <p> He heard Martha shoving the pigs around , but he stayed where he was , as if he had been mortally wounded . <p> Toward evening , he got up and went to the barn to do the milking . Somebody had to do it . The cat was sitting in the wheelbarrow , looking straight ahead without expression , straight through him , giving him the feeling that he did n't exist  --  as if it were n't his farm , but the cat 's . As if it were a cat farm , as it had previously been a rat farm . The barn door was cluttered with the drowsy , formless animals that now owned him . He brushed a couple of them aside and walked inside with a slack jaw . A ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the barn . It was the scythe , jutting out like the beak of a large bird that had hanged itself . Sluggishly , he lifted it down and went outside , over toward the wheelbarrow . The cat , still sitting there , did not turn . Daniel aimed and swung hard , focusing all his hatred in the swing , leaving things completely to chance . In a flash he saw the coiled body of the cat fling itself grotesquely out into the air . Then the scythe blade slammed hard into the wood , striking something with a ringing sound . Filled with sudden terror , he watched the blade snap , and a fragment whistled by close to him . The farmyard swayed . Above him the cat teetered up and down like a mighty dragon on the brink of the abyss , swirling Daniel to its bottom . <p> When he came to his senses , he saw the tomcat sitting unharmed a short distance away , gazing absently at some sparrows raising dust in the driveway like feather balls . <p> Empty as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insubstantial . <p> He did the milking without a thought , a meaningless , mechanical process intended to accomplish one thing : milking a cow . Afterward , he poured out the milk , still an automaton with just one function . The tomcat was sitting in the wheelbarrow again as he shuffled across the farmyard . He barely saw it , but he felt it . A coldness . <p> Martha watched him as he continued straight into the bedroom . Silently , pensively , she cleared the table again . They went without supper that day . When she came into the bedroom , he was lying stiff , staring up at the ceiling like a statue that had been knocked off its pedestal . She wet her lips but could think of nothing to say . She , too , lay down quietly . Outside , it grew darker and darker . The night flowed in like a pool of blood . Its acrid smell pressed against the walls . She listened anxiously to the banshee-like wailing as the cats flayed off one anothers ' ear flaps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustion . Her flesh was torn as if by inner demons that had been summoned to life by the howls of the cats . Her eye sockets burned , and her lips rested against each other as hard as two calloused ridges . She opened her mouth to keep them apart . The bloody smell of the darkness made her throat raw , and she strained to fall asleep . <p> She woke up to the glow of a fire that played uneasily over the windowpane . Without comprehension she looked at the feverish patterns on the rectangle of glass . Repetitious living pictures of nothingness , blazing , extravagant , confusing . She felt for Daniel . He was n't there , and she was immediately alert and awake . She leaped out of bed and ran outside . She called . She called as if there was something wrong with Daniel and not with the farm . As if she were calling to a dead man . <p> He was standing at the gable end of the house , a singed , black pillar . His hair looked strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the fire and did n't notice her . He had a livid scratch down his face . She let him stand there . <p> The animals had gotten out . Daniel had been lucky enough to get them free in time . They could hear them bellowing and making noises in the surrounding darkness which , rent apart , fluttered about the wall of the house in great anchored sheets . The roof of the barn was gone , and there was n't much left . She was amazed that she had n't noticed anything before . <p> " It was the lantern , " he said without looking at her . " It was hanging on the nail . It must have fallen down or something . " <p> She nodded mutely . He usually took an oil lantern over to the barn with him at night . He must have forgotten it when he came in the house acting so strangely . The cats must have pulled it down . <p> They continued to stand there watching their farm crumble to a heap of cinders and rubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that did n't make much difference . It was still the farm that was burning . <p> Their life 's farm , which was insured for far too little . <p> Neighbors began to arrive and crowd around them . Daniel hardly responded to their animated questions . Their concern was rebuffed by his gruff calm , and they withdrew to an offended circle around the place while they waited for something to happen . One statement was all they got out of him : " It was just the lantern . It fell down . " That was so little that it was insolent , and they measured him angrily with their eyes and spit copiously into grass that was smoldering with flying embers . Gradually the group dispersed , and the two petrified pillars remained standing alone at the gable end of the house . They had n't moved . A gray light began to break above the hill , and still they stood there . They stood waiting for the same thing . They wanted to see something . The cats . <p> Suddenly they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not a heap of scattered , charred bodies . Not a flock of limping , scorched creatures . But a legion milling around in disarray , sniffing for milk . They had come home tired and thirsty from a night of roaming . They found a pile of ashes . Mewing softly , they circled , watching for live coals or hot fragments of stone . Then they began to leave . The cat nation was evacuating the farm the same way the rat nation had . The couple stood watching the grayish line of lithely swaying backs . Indifferently , they watched the cats . For a long time . Then she touched his hand and drew him inside with her . They caught sight of the wheelbarrow in the middle of the farmyard . They stood looking , their arms and legs stiff . The tomcat was sitting straight as a stone looking out into the gray morning . Its eye-slits glowed like two fish bellies . pale and white . It paid no attention to them . Martha realized how cold she was . She shivered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man she was bringing with her from the night . She squeezed it and tried to force something into it , something that she had kept back from it for a long time . On the doorsill they stumbled over something . She knew what it was but pretended not to see it . For the sake of this hand . For the sake of the inarticulate night . It was the oil lantern , polished , extinguished , and set out of the way , as usual . <p> She turned halfway around . He staggered along behind her with closed eyes . The cat had disappeared from the wheelbarrow . <p> Translated by Frank Hugus <p> KNUD HOLST <p> Knud Holst ( b. 1936 ) has published numerous volumes of fiction and poetry since his writing debut in 1962 .
