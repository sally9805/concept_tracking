<p> It could be Georgia 's biggest non-Olympic public project this decade . <p> It could be the rebirth of the community most severely damaged by the Great Flood of ' 94 . <p> It could be the transformation of one of Georgia 's poorest urban areas into a model of planning and design . <p> For now , though , the could-bes stand out in harsh contrast to the bleak realities of the recovery of south Albany . <p> Nearly a year after the flood , much of south Albany remains mud- stained and abandoned . About 40,000 people lived in the area before the flood ; fewer than half that many live there now . More than 5,800 housing units - about one-fifth of the city 's total - were destroyed , nearly all of those in south Albany . Fewer than 1,500 have been rebuilt . <p> Dozens of abandoned homes have been torched by arsonists . Dozens more have been marked for demolition in day-glo paint letters : DEMO . <p> All four public schools in the 8-square-mile flood zone were damaged beyond repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The library is closed . Few businesses have reopened . <p> More than 2,000 flood-displaced people are still living in mobile home encampments set up on treeless plains by government disaster agencies . Scores of families are still living in travel trailers in the driveways of their partially rehabilitated homes , mostly because they ca n't get financing to finish the work . <p> And some who have returned to homes in the flood zone have found themselves surrounded by empty dwellings , not neighbors . <p> " There has been a tremendous decimation in south Albany , " said Rep. Sanford Bishop ( D-Ga. ) , whose district includes Albany . He moderated a six-hour hearing in Albany last weekend , when several hundred people sought answers and vented frustrations on flood-related issues . " It 's like a major organ has been removed from the body politic of this community . " <p> However long the physical part of the recovery takes , Bishop said , " I do n't think the effects of the flood will ever be erased from the psyches of the people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , but south Albany is still a disaster zone . <p> The pace of the flood recovery has left many residents " totally frustrated , totally degraded , " said David Williams , who represents much of south Albany on the City Commission . " These people were victimized by the flood . Many lost everything they had , and now they 're being victimized all over again . " <p> For 65-year-old Evelyn Clarke , a widow who raised 16 children , the long aftermath of the flood has left her feeling virtually trapped in her trailer , since it 's often too hot to venture outside . She misses being in her home , where she could tend her plants and flowers . <p> " This has almost driven me crazy , " she said . " I 've pulled corn when I was eight months pregnant and shucked peanuts with a 3-week-old baby on my back , but now I ca n't get one little old house put back up . I 'm in prison here . I need to go home . " <p> Questions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not money , per se . The severity of the flood damage was obvious to everyone who saw it , so a massive amount of aid has been made available to Albany , including : <p> $ 82 million from a community development block grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development . <p> $ 22 million in disaster relief from the Federal Emergency Management Agency . <p> $ 30 million from the U.S. Department of Education to rebuild the four south Albany schools destroyed in the flood . <p> $ 3 million in business development loans earmarked for south Albany under an Enterprise Zone program approved before the flood . <p> The problems have arisen over when the money will flow and who will control the faucet . <p> A consulting firm is developing a master plan for the flood recovery and redevelopment . The consultants are expected to present a range of options to the Albany City Commission by the end of July , and then the commission must debate and vote on the plan 's final form . <p> City Manager Roy Lane said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community than it was before the flood . " We do n't want to just fix the houses and not deal with the problems that were there before , " he said . <p> The large sums available to the city represent a " unique opportunity , " in that it would take a city like Albany three to four decades to normally qualify for that much community development funding . <p> Lane said he recognizes that frustration is high among people who are still displaced . However , he said , federal officials have informed him that Albany is " months , even years " ahead of the expected timetable for a program of such magnitude . <p> The frustrations of south Albany residents are understandable , Bishop said , but he is satisfied that federal and local officials are doing all they can to make the recovery a reality . He added that congressmen from districts hit by disasters in recent years , including Southern California , the Midwest and South Florida , have told him that his district seems to be progressing as rapidly as , or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . . . just knew they were hurting and that money was available , and they could n't understand why it has n't been getting to them , " Bishop said . " But regulations must be followed , and there must be accountability in spending the funds . " <p> Too many meetings <p> Nevertheless , some people in south Albany have run out of patience with the concept of planning . <p> " These people had so little beforehand , then they lost everything they had ; and now , a year later , city officials are trying to tell them , ' We 're making progress , ' " said William Wright , head of the Dougherty County chapter of the NAACP . <p> Wright said there has been too much planning and not enough action . " People are tired of meeting . They 're met out . The people who run all these meetings are listening , but they do not hear . " <p> The recovery of south Albany has been considerably slower than that of some comparable South Florida communities after Hurricane Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. , set up offices in both areas after the disasters . <p> " By this time , South Florida was so far along we were having trouble finding work , " Freeman said . " Here in Albany , there 's plenty of work , and plenty of money available . But there 's no action . " <p> In mid-June , the city began taking applications from homeowners seeking funds from the HUD block grant to complete their home repairs . <p> Racial undercurrent <p> The flood story has had racial overtones ever since the waters started rising . The most heavily damaged part of the city was also the part with the highest black population . <p> After the flood , rumors that floodwaters had been diverted to the black sections of town in order to spare the more affluent white sections gained wide credence among blacks . And even after federal investigators determined that such a diversion was impossible , the suspicions persisted . <p> Since the flood , there has been open anger among Albany blacks over more tangible flood-related issues , including the dumping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rebuilding versus relocating the flood-damaged schools . <p> The Dougherty County school board has determined that the schools can not be rebuilt on their present sites , so new locations outside the flood plain are being sought close to the former neighborhood sites . <p> State Rep. John White , who represents much of south Albany , said the racial politics of the past contributed to the severity of the problems . Historically , south Albany has had insufficient storm drainage , and many of the homes were substandard , partly because housing codes often were not rigorously enforced against politically well-connected absentee landlords , he said . <p> Things may change , White said . This year , the city commission became a majority-black body for the first time . <p> " Some of the problems of south Albany were created by racial divisions , " White said . " Unfortunately , they 've got to be fixed the same way . " <p> But the pace of the recovery should be accelerated , irrespective of racial divisions , White said .
