THE EXECUTIVE CONTROLLING PARTNER Poppy 's Valium Librium Empirin #4 fills the brim of an unblemished vial . His syringe , capped by a short plastic nipple , rests on a puff of white gauze . A flaccid rubber tube coils into the shape of a circular maze . All the items are meticulously arranged on a hospital tray whose stainless steel reflects the dim red glow of camera surveillance lights . My hands are suited with rubber gloves . My face is masked . My hair is shaved from my head and arms . I smell of a sweet coconut-scented antiseptic . " The nights feel longer , Mr. Louse , " Poppy says as he wakes from a deep sleep . " Yes , sir . " " The days feel shorter . " " Yes , sir . " " Mr. Louse ? " " Yes , sir ? " " Which one is it ? " " It is night , Poppy . " " The nights feel longer . " " Yes , Poppy . They do . " Poppy breathes shallow breaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western night table and bend over his body to search for a point of entry . As I hover over him , his forehead thickens into wrinkled folds of flesh . Within them , the folds contain clusters of what look like shattered pearls . The icy fissures cascade into tufts of a long auburn beard , greasy and patched with streaks of lint-gray . The slick hair languidly folds over his lips and jowls in such a manner that it 's very difficult to read any form of expression on his face . If his beard should silently jostle around , I often imaginevarious affectations and looks , as , say , when one imagines life bustling about under the gaseous surface of a distant planet . I might perceive , for instance , phantoms of irony or bitterness or despair , a silent request whose message I feel individually responsible for . Any kind of bodily motion shakes the few remaining hairs straddling his scalp ; they shake and twist like antennae homing in on coded frequencies , always followed by his voice , his commands , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide in the shadows of thick beetle-brows and high cheek bones . When they are visible , they are distant and shy , veiling his dictates with numb appraisals . " Try here , " he says , rolling over onto his stomach . With a looping brown finger nail , he points me down the shingled path of his body . My eyes travel the curves of the nail to his loin cloth . The elastic waist hugs the bones of his hips , which are distended and sharply angle into his legs . His skin is like moth-eaten velvet and shimmers like the phosphorescence of a crashed wave . I fear that a slip of the finger will puncture or bruise its cloudy sheen . As I take hold of the back of his knee I begin humming the third movement of Mozart 's " Requiem " in the key of D minor . I am to hum this as I search for a point of entry . Poppy 's few remaining open veins appear and disappear and reappear . When I find a thin streak of blue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his muscles contract . I uncoil the tube and tie it around his leg . Taut . Very taut . He likes to lose all sensation . He likes the rush that results when I release the tension . According to his last memo , I am to constrict whichever part of his body I have to in order to find the most functional vein . The low moan of the chambers ' ventilation system changes frequency as Poppy sighs from the back of his throat . " Tighter , Mr. Louse . " " Yes , Poppy . " I tie the band tighter . He coughs a little , and then , as instructed , I take hold of the syringe between my forefinger and middle finger . I remove the plastic nipple from the tip of the needle and place it on the tray . I push the plunger with my thumb , stick the needle in the vial , and pull the plunger back up . When the liquid fills to the proper measure , I tap away the remaining air bubbles inside the tube . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He does n't say anything in response . Confirmation that I am ready is all he requires . I am to rest my left forefinger at the point of entry . I am to insert the needle slowly so that he feels it enter . I am then to insert it as deeply as it will go . I place my left forefinger over an open lesion and slowly and deeply insert . His leg spasms a little . He sighs again . I push the plunger down , but only halfway . I am to push the plunger halfway , then I am to pull back . This works to mix his blood with the compound , which is heavy on codeine , light on aspirin , caffeine , phenacetin . I wait a moment longer . Then I push the new mixture into his vein . I remove the needle as slowly as I inserted it and delicately replace it on the tray . I remove the rubber band and recoil . I stop humming . Poppy 's foot trails off to the edge of the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mozart 's melody from where I left off , humming a nasal hum . I promptly step away from him toward a large picture window covered with long smooth sheets of aluminum foil . The window nearly runs the length of the western wall and has never revealed anything more than a dim reflection of Poppy 's chambers -- the bed , a nightstand , the television , and a sprawl of discarded newspapers , legal pads , and Kleenex that surrounds the bed 's periphery . I proceed around the sprawl of papers and under the low-lying ducts of the ventilation system . The ventilation system , which is heat sensitive , prevents mold and mildew from collecting on or within these papers ' fibers , or between any ordinary crevices for that matter , in gaps of generally unseen and unimagined space . Poppy 's chambers are so dry , in fact , that on occasion , a corner of an old Wall Street Journal has been known to curl up like the ear of a curious dog . Over time , the debris deposited around Poppy 's bed has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and valleys , plateaus and plains , buttress against the edges of canyons and ravines made of uneven folds of newsprint . It is not hard to imagine that if water were to fall from the ceiling , creeks , streams , and rivers would flow into lakes and estuaries , and Poppy 's bed would buoy up like a raft floating over the black-bottom silt of a swamp . I close the door to his chambers so that it slams shut . This way he can hear the latch click and imagine my hand falling comfortably to my side . I bow my head , dim the lights of the long hallway , and walk with slow strides toward the kitchen . The floors of the western wing , as well as the eastern , northern , and southern wings , are covered in gray linoleum . The red pulses of camera surveillance lights flicker and streak down the glossy finish . The illumination reflects off glass cabinets filled with Poppy 's paper planes , of which there are thousands , each named for either Kathryn , Betty , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the three bathrooms adjoining Poppy 's chambers . Each woman looks down over her own province of scrubbed white marble . Each has eyes that can see to anywhere in her room . The heads turn as a subject crosses before them and nod when a subject kneels to the floor . The images , in their entirety , are equipped to glow in the dark ; when they do , they cast a soft greenish hue onto the walls . Kathryn is the youngest and most pouting of the three . Her hair is long and slightly drapes over her left cheek . Her eyes are round , but appear narrow because of the way her long lashes hang like parasols . Her face is wide , her lips are full and glistening and just barely parted . Betty is more severe , angling forward . Her hair twists into a tight bun . Her nose is raised to a height that affects snobbery . Her lashes curve up like the sharp edges of a porcupine 's fear-stricken back . And then there is Jane who looks moribund . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this one . Her hair is bobbed and hangs in her face , which is fallen and disturbed and nearly violent . The corners of her mouth slightly arch ; the rim of her nose slightly flares . Otherwise , her eyes are hollow ; they are dark and hollow , fully indulged in the heavy mood of the shade . The glass cabinets encasing Poppy 's aircraft line the outer corridors of the entire thirty-third floor . They hold thousands of planes , each of whose creases was crafted by Poppy with much care . When the old man snaps one away with his brittle wrist , his expression constricts and he looks as though he calculates the angles of ascent , counts the seconds the wings remain aloft , contemplates the pull of gravity on the nose . I occasionally see him watch me lift a plane from the border of linoleum on the periphery of his chambers . As I pinch the fuselage and delicately place it on a silver tray , I can feel his eyes wince when the belly 's fold touches my reflection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emanates from the kitchen 's doorway . The countertops , tabletops , and floor glow white . Everything glows and sparkles and turns at ninety degree angles . The sink , the refrigerator , the stove , all the appliances are polished , stainless and brushed steel -- the cabinets , the preparation areas , the doors to the dozen pantries as well . The windows are spotless . The intensity of the kitchen 's light forces the night into an opaque reflection of the room 's glow . I enter the " Medical Supplies " pantry containing Poppy 's medical supplies . It is a small room unto itself -- six feet wide and twelve feet long . White lacquered storage units with shelves and cupboards run the length of the walls on both sides . The bottom of the door is magnetized , as is the wall , so that when I walk in , the door remains ajar . Next door to " Medical Supplies " is " Sterilization , " a much larger room , a room almost the size of the kitchen , which is quite large , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sterilization attendants , share a shift , during which time they sanitize all of Poppy 's utensils , pots , pans , pens , paper , sheets , smocks , masks , and an entire host of miscellany that is necessary to decontaminate before it enters Poppy 's presence . I open a cupboard on the wall that " Medical " shares with " Sterilization " in order to retrieve a Ziploc storage bag . " Do you know him ? " It is Mr. Lutherford . Even muffled through the thin wall , Mr. Lutherford 's voice is very distinct . As is Mr. Heinrik 's . Mr. Lutherford 's resonates from his barrel chest and is very deep and coarse . Mr. Heinrik 's voice is soft and terse . The two men babble incessantly , constantly pushing the boundaries of authorized speech . " Do you know him ? " Mr. Lutherford repeats . " No , I 'm afraid not , " Mr. Heinrik responds . " You say he diverted funds ? " " More than you can imagine . " " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountants under him , all under suspicion . " " Is there a name ? " " Blank . " " Blank ? " " Yes , that 's his name . Blank . Mortimer Blank . " " Never heard of him . " " He must be Internal Affairs . " " No further access then . " " I 'm surprised they 've disclosed as much as they have . " " It 's too bad . " " Yes , too bad . " The two men pause for a moment . " What is the news ? " I ask through the cupboard as I dip Poppy 's tray into a square pan full of rubbing alcohol . " Mr. Louse ? " they say in unison . " Yes . " " Since when are you interested in the news ? " Mr. Heinrik asks . " Mr. Louse interested in the news ? " Mr. Lutherford echoes . " I 'm only interested in wishing you two a good evening , " I say , not really wanting to have anything to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest news , I like to stay uninvolved . It 's my way . I merely like to let them know I 'm here , listening . " You 'll be delighted to hear that there is nothing to report , Mr. Louse , " Mr. Heinrik says . " Tonight we are surrounded by angels such as yourself , " says Mr. Lutherford . " He 'll have his wings any day now , no doubt . The first into Paradise . " " No doubt . " " Just wanted to let you know I was here , " I say as I remove a Ziploc storage bag from a shelf . " As usual , " they say in unison . " Until later , " I say . " Yes , later , " they say . I click the cupboard closed . Their voices disappear . I retrieve the used syringe , place it into the Ziploc bag , and dispose of it in the incinerator at the very back of the room . The rubber tubing , which I wrap around Poppy 's limbs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub of rubbing alcohol . The bottle full of his elixir is to be placed in a cupboard on the opposite wall , marked " Pharmaceuticals . " I am then instructed to shut the door and go to my quarters . My quarters are exactly twice the dimensions of the pantry . They are located near the northern corner of the eastern wing alongside the other quarters demarcated for domestic personnel . The walls are bare , painted white ; the floors are covered in white tiles . I have a twin bed made up of a box spring and mattress . A skylight looks up to evening constellations . During the day it is covered with a scrim that filters out the brightness and the heat . It mechanically closes at daybreak and opens after dusk . Under the skylight is a desk , which is situated near the entrance to the bathroom , where I have my own toilet , private shower , cleaning supplies , wash basin , and incinerator . Red camera surveillance lights blink in all corners of the room and the bathroom . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through which I can watch my neighbor Mr. Crane , the maintenance engineer , and through which he can watch me . I rarely look in on him , however . I have no idea how often he looks in on me . Theoretically , we can look in on each other at any time , though never simultaneously . When this occurs , the hole turns black , and we therefore know the other is present . We must then follow the contract , which states : staff members must forfeit their voyeurism for the remainder of the day and/or night . This has happened to me and Mr. Crane just once . Usually he is n't in . Only on several occasions have I caught him at home , pacing the floors of his cramped quarters , reclining on his bed , getting ready for his duties . I will look through the hole when I am in search of entertainment . Thus far , however , Mr. Crane has provided me very little . Other than the fact that his head has an unusual oblong shape that casts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull . He tends to sit on the edge of his bed and look out his skylight , even when there is nothing to be seen . When I reach my quarters , I sit at my desk , do a check of the procedure as I glance down at the section of my contract regarding Poppy 's tray . I am to keep this section of the contract laminated and in the upper left-hand drawer of the desk along with a syringe full of a drug with which , twice daily , I am to inject myself in the thigh . It slows my heart rate and makes me a little faint . I do not know what purpose it serves . All I know is that I am to inject myself with it once in the late morning and once at night . If and only if I am convinced that I have successfully inoculated myself , can I remove my gloves from my hands , the mask from my face , the smock from my body , and drop these things down the incinerator installed in my bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow the dizziness to pass as I look at my reflection in the mirror , wondering how Mr. Crane perceives me as he looks through his hole . I too am not a very handsome man and must seem as dull to him as he seems to me . I can surmise from the lines around my eyes and above my brow , from the few gray hairs sprouting off my chest , that I am , perhaps , in my midthirties . I have thin cheeks and a short chin . My nose is somewhat aquiline , but not exactly beak-like . My eyes are brown and almond shaped and my ears are unusually large . My body is fit , but not well-defined . My hands are somehow too large for my body and my thumbs are slightly deformed ; they are bent at the joint , turning inward against my index fingers . Small bones protrude from the joints like warts , and are callused over from the motion of rubbing them against my palms . Contrary to what my physiognomy would suggest , I am very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am able to present Mr. Crane or my anonymous observers any kind of thrill , it is when I hunt flies , the ones that find their way into our quarters through the air conditioning vents . We are required to hunt them ; something I take great pleasure in , unlike Mr. Crane , who allows the flies to buzz around his quarters until they are nearly dead from boredom . He sits on his bed with his swatter in hand and makes exhausted and fake attempts to hunt his prey . I , on the other hand , find the hunt stimulating and take it seriously . One might assume that the buzzing and the banging against the walls and the skylight in search of freedom would make me feel uncomfortable . But not at all . Just the opposite . I look forward to their arrival . In fact , I await their arrival with great anticipation . I have in my desk drawer , beside my contract , a regulation fly swatter to be used on such occasions . I run and jump and crawl and feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Against what I initially believed when I first took up this avocation , there are many ways a fly swatter will weigh down upon its prey . I have caught flies by their hind legs , by a wing . I have turned many into one winged flies and managed , on a few occasions , to catch them by their remaining wing . I have felt great pride watching flies with no wings run and jump off their hind legs , only to land on their faces . I have splattered flies and decapitated them . To splatter a fly in one straight shot , I have discovered , is n't nearly as entertaining as breaking it down bit by bit , wing by leg by head . Since the first day I was escorted to my quarters , I have sent three hundred twenty-three flies down the incineration chute to the fire . I have killed flies on every wall , under my bed , in the shower , and the sink . I have even splattered one directly on the lens of a surveillance camera . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of collecting them . I would like to label and pin them to rows of Styrofoam and catalogue them in wooden drawers . Of course , I would never be allowed . But I do relish the idea . I ca n't help but wonder whether if I had any concrete memories of the past , I would be fascinated with such things . But the fact of the matter is that I do n't . I do n't know why this is , or why it has to be . I have asked . I have asked and I have been ignored and have been dealt with . So I stopped asking after some time . Now , among other things , I chase flies when I am away from my duties . When the dizziness from my injection passes , I wash my hands and my face with surgical scrub , then change my shoes and my uniform . I send the smock , mask , and rubber gloves down the incinerator chute and continue toward the interoffice elevator bank in order to gather supplies for the midnight movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than nine minutes and thirty seconds . Should an attendant think of taking half steps or shortcuts through this procedure , he can be demoted up to .5 percent against his debt . The current yield on his debt will appreciate X months later than current appreciation date . Number of months are determined by the level of the infraction . The regulation of half steps and shortcuts applies to all procedures for which all staff members are responsible . It is known as the " Liability Doctrine . " In short , if any half step or shortcut is taken through any procedure , we are liable for our lack of thoroughness and/or attention to detail , even when such thoroughness and/or attention to detail is dependent on another staff member . This dependency on other staff members makes for interdependence . Every week since I have been Poppy 's ward , I have been suffering from a lack of interdependence . I have been demoted once a week for as long as I can remember because Poppy 's exterminator has never appeared in Poppy 's chambers to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a full step -- I , half the step , he , the other half -- my efforts can not be completed in full . According to my contract , I am to escort the exterminator through the corridors , into the bathrooms , and through Poppy 's living quarters . Every third Thursday of the month , at exactly 9:00 P.M. , I am to wait in one of the three corridors leading to Poppy 's chambers . I am to wait until either Poppy calls for me , or until I am supposed to be somewhere else . Not once has the exterminator shown up , and not once have I heard of an investigation into the exterminator . I do not understand why there has n't been any investigation ; especially since Poppy has seen , on more than several occasions , a small beetle crawling in and out of the various ravines of his chambers ' landscape . When I tell Poppy that the exterminator has been neglecting his duties , he tells me about the Communist diaspora and the nature of the Mongol hordes of the thirteenth century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khan led on a fortress in Bukhara in the region of Central Asia . He will condemn the Mongols in both the Chinese and Russian governments , blame them for these regimes ' obstinacy throughout the centuries . When he is through with his discourse , I ask him what should be done . He says he does n't want me to do anything . In fact , he warns me that I am not to speak about such things until he , himself , sees the insect with his own eyes . And when this occurs , I am not supposed to contact the exterminator , but rather am expected to chase after the bug , capture it , and send it down the incinerator . But every time he has seen this beetle , I have n't . I tell him so . Regardless , I am sent off to attack this invisible creature , dig for it with my fingers , through the refuse of headlines and history , tear away words upon his commands . I destroy the mountain range as I know it , rearrange it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land of all its precious qualities . He points me in this direction and that direction until he tires from the chase and I 'm left panting and sweating and have newsprint and paper cuts covering my hands . I discovered early on that Poppy is deathly afraid to be in the same room with another 's blood , which I find confusing , because he is so exacting when describing the details of medieval weaponry and how , with the proper amount of brute force , a thick and heavy sword cuts through skin and crushes bone , whereupon a man is a pulsing corpse . On the several occasions I have bled in his presence , he has informed Celia Lonesome , Head of Domestic Staff , to send a cleaning crew to disinfect his chambers . During this time he remains in bed as the workmen clean around him , spraying heavy doses of ammonia onto the newspapers and into the air . Dressed in smocks , masks , and rubber gloves , the crew disinfects and scours until they have depleted most of the chambers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calms him of his terror . And , mind you , his terror is quite real . I have learned that he has many fears like this , and if one wished to torment him it would be a very simple chore . If there was a man of action and malicious deeds who did n't care about his fate , he could threaten Poppy 's sanity with a simple pitcher of rain water . I have learned that it is n't so much the blood , although it is the blood , but more that blood is liquid . He fears most forms of liquids -- to see them , drink them , touch them , be in their presence . He is convinced that liquids in general , especially water , and even water purified by the staff , is contaminated . He has a similar aversion to fresh fruits , meats , and vegetables . He says , " the grit of the earth , the dew of the morning , the fertilizers , are full of infectious bacteria , bacteria imperceptible to the eye , deadly and unspeakably unfriendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl cubicles under white fluorescent rods . A labyrinth of small offices and passages recesses into the northern-most quadrant of the building . Fingers type furiously . Telephone receivers simultaneously lift and fall . I enter a door that leads to an interoffice elevator and swipe my identification card through an electronic eye , then punch in my code . The elevator 's reflective silver doors open into a reflective silver interior . I press B1 . The doors close . The elevator drops , and I can feel the rapid descent in the core of my stomach . I ride down thirty-three floors and exit through Accounting , which , like the offices in the penthouse , recesses deep into the back of the building , only deeper . Large stacks of bundled greenbacks meticulously line the desks of the swing shift money managers , the ones who work through all hours of the night to take advantage of the international markets . I pass through a glass-encased corridor and watch the faces of the men and women as their lips incessantly mutter indistinguishable syllables . They thrust them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized by pursed lips and indented brows . A small group of men and women dressed in our standard uniform of gray suits , gray vests , blue ties , black belts , black shoes , huddle together in the passageway . They are huddled so tightly I ca n't make out a single face . Their voices remain compressed within their circle . " Have you been implicated ? " " I could n't say . What about you ? " " I 'm not sure . But I would n't rule it out . " " We can never rule it out . " " Guilty by design . " " Yes , guilty by design . " " It 's just hard to say what may come of it . " " Especially when they 're still making assessments . " " The future is in the hands of the present . " " So they say . " " It will come out soon enough . " " Of course . " " Of course . " " He will ... " " They say ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ... us ... " And the voices drift as I reach the end of the hall . The hallway ends . I open a door that leads to a narrow glass-paned hall identical to the one I just left . Lights illuminate the money counters sorting through crane-loads of coins laid out in mounds on glass tables . I take a corridor to the right , then the left , through a double security door guarded by an individual behind dark tinted glass , and then down another flight of stairs , which deposits me into a large subterranean warehouse where the noise of forklifts and other heavy machinery begins to make itself known to my ears . Beside the door is a row of chairs . A line of teenagers looking approximately the same age sit in demure silence . The one closest to the door stands to attention . " Yes , sir ! " he says to me with a stiff upper lip . He recognizes that I am a domestic from my shaved head and arms . His hand starts to shake a little -- he knows who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I say to the boy as I hand him a prewritten list of items I need . " Yes , sir ! " he says . His youthful legs sprint down the long corridor into the supply room . As I wait for him to return , one boy begins whispering into another boy 's ear , and the next thing I know they are all whispering to each other . " They revealed some names . " " The ones under Blank ? " " Yes . Berger , Lumpit , Nester , and Blurd . " " Blurd ? " " Yes , Blurd . " " Anyone else ? " " No . " " But there are more to come . " " Anything concrete ? " " Their books were confiscated . " " Yes , that I heard . " " They 're being reviewed . " " They say many others . " " Many names . " " Yes , they 'll follow . " " Found in a vault , they say . " " In a trunk . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find others . " " There is no telling how far up it will go . " " I have heard a woman in Internal Affairs . " " Let go to Sales . " " They have the most evidence on her . " " Nothing shredded . " " Nothing hidden . " " It was all there in plain light . " " They say she confessed . " " I wonder how long it will be before the viewing ? " " It should n't be long . " " It could be any time now . " " Is there any other news ? " " Only that it 's big . " " Bigger than ever before . " " Our lives are to be affected . " " Changed . " " Never to be the same again . " " Our path to Paradise might be ... " " To be kept from Paradise ... " " It just might be . " " A great disappointment . " " So it seems . " " Yes . " " Yes yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent . I look at them . They look at me . " Very well done , " I say to the boy . He hands back my list , on which is stamped " Received . " He hands over six black and six blue pens ( all of which are individually shrink-wrapped and inspected for noticeable perforations ) , four yellow legal pads ( also individually shrink-wrapped ) , and a Wall Street Journal wrapped in a plastic bag with a red twisty tie at the top ( each page has been lightly misted with disinfectant ) . I ask the boy 's name because I am impressed with his diligence . " Venison , sir ! " " Good work , Venison . " I briskly walk away from the boys to show them my diligence is not unlike theirs , that I too have an authority to whom I must bow . I can hear their whispers turn into plain speech as I depart . It follows me through the narrow passageway until I am several hundred feet beyond them . When I reach Bathroom Number Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray whose specific purpose is for the bathroom 's preparation . I remove a pair of sterilized rubber gloves from a supply closet resembling the medical supply pantry in the kitchen and put them on . I remove the Wall Street Journal from its package and unfold it . I go to the center page and lay the fold over the newspaper rack built into the wall for such a purpose . I leave each pen and pad in its shrink-wrap and place these items on a shelf below the rack . From Bathroom Number Three 's supply closet , I remove a sterilized phone from its shelf along with a cord , which like everything else is wrapped in plastic . I place these things on top of a recently overhauled Zenith and roll everything in front of the toilet . I remove the cord from the bag , plug it into the phone and click the attachment into the wall . I place the phone with the cord neatly coiled next to the toilet on a little foot-stool . I run into the bathroom supply closet and open a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone . I reach into my pocket and remove my tape measure . I measure three feet from the head of the toilet outward to the center of the room . I roll the television over the marble floor to the spot I have visually marked , and plug the power cord into an outlet near Jane 's facade above the sink . I run to the toilet with the remote control in hand and place it on the left-hand armrest . I crouch down and lift the receiver of the phone . I dial Godwin Beeles at the television station . " Beeles here . " " 12 A.M. , " I say and hang up . He knows the procedure . I collect all of the debris and send it down the incineration chute in the supply closet and walk to the kitchen where I am to observe the Head of Domestic Staff , Celia Lonesome , prepare Poppy 's meal . When I reach the kitchen , a plastic package of rice bobs up and down in a pot of boiling water . Poppy 's silver dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining can , a medium-sized pot , a Pyrex bowl , a package of silverware , freshly bleached cotton napkins , and a can opener . Ms. Lonesome exits Food Pantry Number Four carrying a can of peaches . She greets me with the smile with which we are to greet one another . " Good evening , Mr. Louse . " " Good evening , Ms. Lonesome . " I look into her light blue eyes , which are translucent and void of any visible curiosity . The bright fluorescent light of the kitchen reflects off her smooth white skin . Her face is round and shows no revealing signs of age or expression . Unlike Mr. Heinrik and Mr. Lutherford , Ms. Lonesome has no distinct intonations or patterns of speech . She stresses her vowels as if they 're not there . Her consonants click against her palate and her lips without enthusiasm , as if she is n't talking at all . Each utterance triggers no recollection of any time or place in my forgotten past . In fact , her mouth hardly moves when she talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice straight to my brain , and we are talking telepathically . " Have you heard the news , Mr. Louse ? " " No , Ms. Lonesome . Not in full . " Ms. Lonesome gently and slowly rocks the can of peaches between her palms , against the front of her blouse . " Intelligence has discovered the source of the missing funds , " she says softly . " The money has been attached to Mr. Blank . Mortimer Blank . Who they believe laundered the money with the assistance of a small group of accountants and Intelligence officers . Pan Opticon reports that Paradise may be threatened . It is very worrisome , Mr. Louse . " " Yes , I agree , Ms. Lonesome . Very worrisome . " Ms. Lonesome looks at me blankly . I look at Ms. Lonesome with what feels like longing . Ms. Lonesome turns away . I could , at this juncture , inquire if she knows anything of Mr. Blank . But I generally find that the obvious questions are always the questions that never have answers . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen wash basin . She lifts a scrub brush and applies it to the can of peaches . She turns on the water and scrubs . Her motions , like her language , are confident and reassuring . She scrubs the metallic container until all remnants of the adhesive once holding the wrapper are gone . She scrubs until the canister is shining . She wipes . She polishes with a fresh paper towel and places the can on the tray next to the other can . She goes to the stove and with one hand removes the package of rice with a pair of tongs , and with the other wipes the water from the plastic with a paper towel . She carefully molds the hot package of rice onto the bottom of the Pyrex bowl , and then walks about the kitchen collecting all the paper goods , which she disposes of in the incinerator next to the sink . The tray is prepared , all but for the beverage . Ms. Lonesome walks to Refrigerator Number Three and removes a sanitized bottle of grape flavored NeHi . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places the bottle onto the tray , takes hold of the silver handles and walks toward me and then past me into the obscurity of the western wing . She delicately steps on the linoleum floor so as not to make noise with her heels . Her posture is very good and her uniform is crisp . She really is the most outstanding staff member by all means , a good example to us all . Poppy 's euphoria has worn off by the time Ms. Lonesome and I enter his chambers .
