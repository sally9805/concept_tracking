Dating heads-up at you can really learn about the inner man based only on his outer self // There are two ways of sizing up a man . You could spend long hours talking to him , getting to know him , and - let 's be honest - wasting nights in the hope that he 's the one for you . Or you could figure him out by observing a few simple ( nonverbal ) clues . " You can discern his true nature quickly by just reading the way he dresses and acts , " explains Michael Broder , Ph.D. , a clinical psychologist in Philadelphia .. So to help you size up the guy you already have under observation - or the one you want a close peek at - Cosmo went to the experts to find out what men are saying to you , even when their mouths are shut . Analyze His Ensemble If his Hawaiian shirt and cut offs just got you turned away by the maitre d ' , it 's clear he might need a few lessons in spiffing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , how about the guy who dreses head-to-toe in one designer 's clothes ? Or who wears the same blueblazer-and-khaki ensemble every day ? Is he just an unimaginative bore ? Not at all , insists Mark Golin , editor-inchief of the men 's magiazine Maxim , who believes these ensembles actually signify creativity . Consider Albert Einstein , who had a closet full of gray suits . You think he was unimaginative ? Colin explains that " the head-to-toe guy has more important things on his mind . He has priorities . He wants to look good as quickly as possible . " One-note ensembles allow a man to express his creativity in other ways-his ties for example . It 's okay for a guy to dress in one brand like Brooks Brothers " as long as he throws in a BoBo the Clown tie to make it original , " claims Melissa Rivers , fashion critic for E ! Entertainment Television . But beware of the guy who follows fashion trends way too closely , warns Colin : " It may mean he 's self-absorbed and not paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes are sharp does n't mean he is : A 1986 study at the University of Texas at Austin found that guys with the least impressive credentials wore the most expensive clothes and the men often overdressed to compensate for their lack of confidence . Look Him Up and Down The biggest tipoff to what 's going on with a man up there-in his head-might be what 's going on down there- as in ... his shoes . " When a man 's confidence is slipping or he 's not paying attention to details , it 's going to show up first in his shoes , " claims Lisa Cunningham , a New Yorkbased image consultant who counsels Fortune 500 executives . That 's bad because a guy who 's not detail-oriented wo n't be able to keep track of things like birthdays , anniversaries , and which perfume you favor , says Rivers . Instead , pick a shoe lover . Another of his pluses : " He wo n't balk if you come home every week with a new pair . " As for what type of shoes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tie-up shoe is often tied up doing important , as well as fun , things and the guy in loafers may just be a little too casual , even a loafer . But how about less obvious and different footwear like Tevas ? Rivers says a guy who wears them could be outdoorsy , but he also may just be a slug . " Using Velcro to close your shoes is usually a sign of laziness . " Photograph Man scan : Read his inner self from outer signals . // Rivers also feels a guy is lazy if he prefers slipping into clogs , which have become , once again , au courant . Golin cracks that clogs are indicative of a granola guy who is " going to grow an unkempt beard , take tip pottery , and drag you on ' bike hikes . ' " Case His Place If he 's brought you back to his place , then you must have seen something in him . But it 's here in his home that his real self comes to the fore . Here 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messy , do n't write him off as a slob . Christiaan Cino , owner of the Manhattan-based Windmill Cleaning Service , explains that " the messiest homes often belong to extremely busy , very successful people . " Cosmo lifestyle editor Sara Ruffin agrees that a guy who breeds dust bunnies is probably exerting a lot of energy in other areas of his life . " He 's not uptight ; he 's fun , cuddly , and the kind of man you 'll stay in bed with and blow of fa meeting for . " On the other side of the spectrum is Mr. Clean , the kind of guy who irons his underwear and sorts his socks by color Sounds ideal ? Well , yes and no . Sure , you wo n't ever have to worry about what 's growing in the refrigerator , but Ruffin warns that this anal-retentive type probably wo n't ever want you to spend the night because you might mess up his bed sheets . Ruffin also feels the neat freak is " hiding somethingboth literally and figuratively . " Margaret , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " I dated this guy whose place was spotless-even the T-shirts were neatly pressed in his closet . " But to Margaret 's horror she found out he secretly liked to get ' dirty ' with prostitutes . And beware the man whose place looks immaculate the night you come over , but dusty upon better inspection the next morning . This is " dating " decor , says Cino . He 's only tidied just enough-before you came over-because " a woman 's sleeping over . " Here are some other personality tipoffs : Bike-on-a-wall man : While confirmed bachelor Jerry Seinfeld kept a bike on his wall for the shows nine years , Ruffin is against the use of a " bike as art . " Although it may only mean that he 's extremely organized , Ruffin feels that , like Seinfeld , he keeps his wheels because he 's commitment phobic and " always ready to ride on . " Pie guy : There 's good news and bad news about stackers who arrange everything from clothes to bills to newspapers in mile-high piles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Cino . You can also feel pretty secure with a man who builds mountains because " he does n't throw things outyourself included , " says Ruffin . Then again , he 's probably the type who has n't thrown out his ex-girlfriend 's number either . Milk-crate man : A guy whose entire apartment is furnished with milk crates/cinder blocks/plywood may be stuck in his college days or maybe he does n't have any money . Whether design- or doughdeficient , however , both Ruffin and Cino point out that this guy is probably industrious and usually very creative . Plus , says Ruffin , " he 's good with his hands , which has other benefits as well . " Intemet addict : Cino says his clients with top-of-the-line Internet hookups are often those who are n't great socializers . Ruffin says that unless he 's " logging onto the fun stuff and you 're computer literate , " you probably wo n't have a lot to type about . Hi-fi guy : Ruffin thinks the **27;419;TOOLONG are " fools . " She reasons that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $200 stereo or $2,000 one , " they 'd be better off spending their money on something that matters-like me . " Quirky Behaviors Although it often seems that men exhibit bizarre behavior , the following sartorial styles and horrific habits indicate even more about his inner being . Mixed-metaphor man : John F Kennedy Jr . is a perfect example of this kind of guy . He 'll sport an expensively tailored business suit but top it with a knapsack . Jane Greer , Ph.D. , author of How Could You Do This To Me ? ( Doubleday , 1998 ) , explains that this quirk says that he 's confident and has a strong sense of his own identity . " He 'll conform but only until it makes him uncomfortable , " adds Greer . And like John John , a mixed-metaphor man is often a monied man who enjoys his free time . Sunglasses Inside guy : A guy who wears shades inside is usually a narcissist . " It 's a look-at-me statement , " says Greer . He 's also the type of man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's insecure . Greer also feels his desire not to make eye contact can come from a low comfort level . Or in some guys ' cases , from a high level of comfort . Southern Comfort . Knuckle cracker : Instead of being repulsed by guys who crack their knuckles , listen and learn . Sure , a guy who does it is often a nervous type , trying to relieve stress and tension . But Greer says that guys who crack their knuckles are often subconsciously demonstrating strength . Making those miserable movements is their way of telling others how strong they are . Lean machine : You 're talking to him and he 's leaning back in his chair . Maybe it 's the extra-garlic pasta you ordered-or maybe he 's sending you a signal about himself . " A guy who 's leaning back in this way is very open to what comes his way , " says Greer . " He 's self-assured and comfortable in whatever situation he 's in . " When Guys Accessorize What if he shows up for a date wearing enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A guy who wears jewelry makes me very nervous , " says Melissa Rivers . Cosmo 's accessories editor Megan Duchnowski agrees . Although she likes tasteful cufflinks , she advises against " Tony Manero-like gold chains . They 're cheesy and sleazy . " A man who wants to accessorize should do it with a tasteful watch . The watch should mirror the man , says Rivers : simple , masculine , distinctive . " I met this guy James who at first glance looked like a real uptight laser-jacket , tie , tortoiseshell glasses , conservative haircut , " says Marla , a 24-yearold graduate student . " But then I noticed he was wearing this cool watch with Deng Xiaoping waving back and forth . It was kinda cool and wild-which is exactly how he was when we got back to my place . " If his watch is more commonplace , check to see if it 's a Rolex , Tag Hauer , or OmegaDuchnowski says they signify a sophisticated man who cares about appearance . However , if he 's still ticking with a Timex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unpretentious , and certainly has no desire to be flashy or prove anything . " Great communicators : Both Duchnowski and Rivers agree that prominently wearing a pager or cell phone is af faux pas . Since they now easily fit in one 's pocket , having them hang from your clothes only calls out your desire to be somebody . " I think this guy thought he 'd look cool if he had one of his dopey friends call on his cell phone while we were out on a date , " say Heather , a 31year-old marketer . " But to me it just rang out that the guy was self-important . " Capping it off : Accessorizing with a baseball cap , according to Duchnowski , is indicative of a very casual guy . That 's a fine fashion statement if he 's at a game or just popping into the store on Sunday morning . Otherwise , Rivers says point-blank , " caps are a sign he 's balding . " Deconstructing Hairy If his hair puts Edward Scissorhands to shame , we suggest you start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's confident is someone whose cut you do n't notice , " says John Barrett , proprietor of the posh John Barrett Salon in New York City . " Your hair should n't walk into the room before you . " Besides , asks Rivers , " Do you want to be fighting a guy for mirror time ? " How about that guy who sports a ponytail ? " If he 's over 30 , it means he 's flashy and it screams of insecurity , " says Barrett . If you 're a rocker like Anthony Keidis , says Rivers , you can pull it off , Still , she feels it 's " for guys who are trying to hold onto their youth through a few wispy strands . " Or how about the Billy Ray Cyrus shlong-short on the sides , long in the back ? Barrett says simply , " It tells you he has no style at all . " Tangos With Cash Photograph You can judge a lover by his cover . // If he lets you pay on a first date or suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But probably , it just means he 's cheap . Still , sometimes a guy who does not pay is someone who does n't invest in things he 's not sure about , says Greer . " He could be hedging his bets . " Your best bet in these situations is to dump him . Then there 's the guy who is seemingly free with his money-the guy who carries wads of cash . He may look very promising , but " a lot of men flash wads of cash to be accepted into a group because they 're lonely and isolated in real life , " says Leesa Dillman , Ph.V. , assistant professor of communication at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas , who 's observed big-money holders in the Casinoland . Before you call your friends to say you hit the jackpot , Greer suggests you go window-shopping with him . If he says , " Let 's keep going , " the money 's a show and he 's not generous . But if he says , " Let 's go in , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carloads of cash but does n't appear to have any legitimate source of income , you may want to ask him again what he does for a living-and never sit with your back to the restaurant 's door . <p>
