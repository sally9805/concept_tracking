When we 're young , we live our heroes ' lives . As adults , we let these dreams fade . Yet we can still do some extraordinary things in faraway places  --  on vacation . <P> WHERE THE BUFFALO ROAM <P> Who has not dreamed of riding a horse through high country , driving thousands of head of cattle , eating from the chuck wagon , sleeping under a starry sky and , yes , wearing those terrific clothes  --  chaps , and boots with spurs  --  every day ? Sure , quitting your day job and becoming a full-time cowboy is probably out of the question . But it is possible to try your hand at tossing a perfectly circled rope through the air over the head of a 1,000-lb. cow . At the Cowboy School , based in Pearce , Ariz. , Bob King teaches novice cowboys ( O.K. , cowpersons ) old-time roping techniques , plus how to handle cattle , transform a horse into a partner and manage land and water resources . A week ( $1,250 ) includes lodging in an authentic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The week may be spent at the vast Three Sisters Ranch in the Arizona desert ( October through May ) or the Powder River Experience on the Wyoming plains ( June through September ) . King , his wife Betty and other family members welcome men and women who aspire to the cowboy life . Many are from abroad ; many are well past age 50 . Some have recently bought horses  --  or even a ranch  --  without knowing much about either . When Ken Jelden retired at 70 after a long career with Calavo Growers in California , his wife gave him a surprise retirement gift : a week at the ranch . He mastered new roping skills , learned to ride again and particularly enjoyed " taking the cattle out to the pasture , which was very quiet and near the Cochise stronghold where the chief held out against the U.S. Cavalry for several months . " Always fond of Western music and life , Jelden is grateful for his wife 's gift : " I did get to live out a fantasy . " <P> WORKING ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throttle of a full-size , 100-ton steam engine hauling eight graceful coaches from Worcestershire to Shropshire on a track that follows the Severn River as it meanders through unspoiled English countryside . No need for a time machine to fulfill this dream . Adults healthy enough to shovel piles of coal need only register at the Severn Valley Railway school , based in Bewdley , Worcestershire . In the introductory session , they learn safety guidelines and how a locomotive works . They also put in time on the footplate  --  where the fireman and driver stand , stoking the boiler , firing up the engine and managing the controls . In follow-up courses , groups of four students strive to acquire enough skill to drive the locomotive . This involves learning to clean , oil and light up the engine , shunt tracks , couple and uncouple cars  --  and brake , no easy task . John Sinclair , 54 , technical director of a Bedfordshire computer firm , was " quite frightened " during an intermediate course with Severn Valley Railway because even at 25 m.p.h. , the locomotive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " big high " he experienced that he plans to spend $975 to take an advanced course . <P> ARCTIC GETAWAY
