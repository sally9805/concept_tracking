The brass at Fidelity will cry foul , as may the entire mutual-fund industry , which is in sore need of a new superstar . But here goes , anyway : Give it up , Peter Lynch . This stuff about never having worked on a computer and wanting little to do with technology stocks is stale . Very stale . You 've got good company in Warren Buffett , another totemic technophobe . And I 'm not saying to load up exclusively on tech stocks . But it 's plain silly to encourage plain folks to avoid them . They 're not that difficult to understand . If you can figure out Maytag , you can handle Dell . <P> Whew ! Any incoming ? Taking on Lynch and Buffett at their own game is perilous sport . They 're the nearest thing to omniscience Wall Street has to offer . But I 've been thinking a lot about both men 's no-tech dogma since last spring . That 's when Buffett told thousands at Berkshire Hathaway 's annual meeting cum Buffettfest that he wo n't buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and Lynch glibly confessed to thousands more at a fund-industry conference that he does n't know how to turn on a computer . Lynch 's point , as ever a good one , was that you should n't own what you do n't understand  --  most things tech , in his case . <P> But some things are worth knowing . The tech-laden NASDAQ index is up 50% this year . That 's right , 50% , and it 's not all that unusual . In successive years since the last recession ( 1991 ) , the NASDAQ has risen 56.8% , 15.5% , 14.7% , fallen 3.2% , risen 39.9% , 22.7% , 21.6% and 39.6% . It has beaten the Standard &; Poor 's 500 six of the past nine years ( including this one ) . <P> Technology is n't weird science ; it 's everyday life . It 's e-mail . It 's the government wanting to bust up Microsoft , Y2K threatening the globe , the Internet challenging the mall . Ignore it ? O.K. But then forget about beating the market , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a market weighting in tech stocks ( 24% of the S &P; 500 ) along with low expenses and tax-efficient management . That 's a great deal . <P> If you 're trying to do better , though , tech stocks are critical . Of 1,958 diversified stock funds , 673 were beating the S &P; 500 through October . Only 16 of them have less than 5% in tech stocks , Morningstar reports . Since 1992 only 1 in 5 diversified funds that beat the market each year did so without a slug ( at least 5% ) in tech . <P> Sure , they can be confusing  --  just what does Cisco do ?  --  and volatile and pricey . But even strict-value managers , who focus on low stock prices relative to earnings , buy them . " Get your head out of the sand , " Scott Black at Delphi Management advises tech sissies . Look for normal stuff  --  little debt , market dominance , sustainable advantage , strong brand , good managers , a commitment to research and development . You can find tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrow and Nu Horizons .
