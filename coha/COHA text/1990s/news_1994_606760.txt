<p> It was supposed to be a simple photo-op . Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto appeared at an ambulance station here to show empathy for the beleaguered citizens of Karachi , where dozens of people have been killed in recent political and religious violence and monsoon rains have washed away roads , leaving electric , water and sewage service a shambles . <p> Suddenly , Bhutto turned to an employee of the private ambulance company , one of the few services that works in the city , and proclaimed him the new administrator of Karachi , whose entire elected government has been jailed or gone underground over the last two years . <p> The man handpicked to solve the seemingly insurmountable problems of one of the world 's largest cities is Fahimuzzaman Khan , an ambulance helicopter pilot . His qualifications ? During last fall 's elections , Khan , 33 , a Bhutto loyalist , appropriated the ambulance service 's helicopter to ferry Bhutto around the country . <p> According to Abdus Sattar Edhi , founder of the ambulance service , the helicopter Khan commandeered had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules that it be used only for medical emergencies . Edhi said Khan and Bhutto 's trip brought a U.S. protest . <p> " One would expect an elected government to run a megalopolis like Karachi through elected representatives , and not through a helicopter pilot , " said M. Yasin Lakhani , president of the Karachi stock exchange . " He may be good at flying a helicopter , but managing the largest city of the country is serious business . " <p> " His performance has been pretty good , " countered Bhutto spokesman Husain Haqqani . " He 's as qualified as anybody who would be able to get elected . " <p> In the current political vacuum , political , religious and criminal gangs  --  with huge arsenals left over from the Afghan war  --  are engaged in a deadly battle for control of Karachi , a city of 10 million people that used to be Pakistan 's capital and now is the country 's economic engine , generating about half the federal government 's revenue . <p> More than 40 Karachi police officers have been killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political activists have been killed . Rooftop snipers assassinate political foes ; armed gangs steal a dozen cars a day at gunpoint ; Sunni Muslim militants supported by Saudi Arabia and Shiite Muslim extremists backed by Iran have attacked each other 's buses and mosques . <p> Aggravating the lawlessness is the rapid collapse of Karachi 's aging infrastructure , already overtaxed by a population that is increasing by 400,000 people a year . Monsoon floods last summer destroyed roads and killed 55 people , 40 of them electrocuted by downed power lines . Electrical outages left neighborhoods sweltering in the dark for weeks and devastated local industries ; water and sewer problems bred epidemics . <p> " This year has been horrendous , " said Saleem Vahidy , chief of Karachi 's 22,000-member police force . He complained of poor funding , political interference , and competition for resources that he said breeds local mafias . <p> The appointment of helicopter pilot Khan as city administrator underscores the continuing feudal nature of politics in Pakistan , where despite relatively untainted recent elections , democracy is still struggling to take hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between rural , indigenous ethnic groups  --  such as the Sindhis , represented by Bhutto  --  and booming urban centers , where the vast majority of people are Muslims who immigrated here from India during partition . <p> These Urdu-speaking immigrants , who call themselves mohajirs , formed their own political party  --  the Mohajir Qoumi Movement  --  in 1985 ; now , it typically captures about three-quarters of the vote in Karachi . But Pakistan 's army and leading political parties , shut out of power in the country 's most important city , have accused the Mohajir party of being rife with criminals . Over the last two years , most of its leaders  --  including Karachi 's mayor and members of its City Council  --  have been arrested or gone into hiding , leaving the local government effectively dissolved . The city has been under occupation by 30,000 army troops since May 1992 . <p> According to observers here , Karachi 's physical and social collapse stems ultimately from its political breakdown . With murky lines of authority , few taxing powers and almost no accountability for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rampant . <p> Mohajir party spokesman M.A. Jalil , a former education minister who has 40 criminal charges pending , said , " What Karachi needs is the right to collect taxes like elsewhere in the democratic world , and it needs a mayor or public representatives who can make decisions without taking every small thing to the state or federal government for approval . " <p> However , Jalil acknowledged that extremists and criminals became increasingly influential in his party in the early 1990s , inviting a crackdown by the army and police . But , he and others charged , the army used that as a pretext for a full-scale assault on the party . <p> Iqbal Haider , Bhutto 's justice minister , said many of the recent slayings here were the result of power struggles in the Mohajir party , which he charged is " thoroughbred terrorist from top to bottom . Their basic character is violent and bloodthirsty . " <p> Karachi 's political and ethnic problems stem from the division of the Indian subcontinent into the separate states of India and Pakistan , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partition led to one of history 's largest spontaneous migrations , as millions of Muslims from India moved to the Islamic state of Pakistan and millions of Hindus migrated in the opposite direction . <p> The mohajirs tended to settle in the urban areas . Generally better educated than the " natives " of Pakistan , they were appointed to many top government posts in the early years and became the country 's leading businessmen . <p> In the following decades , the indigenous groups exerted their power , and the mohajirs were gradually pushed out of the government . Today , many see the decision to shift the country 's capital from Karachi to Islamabad in the early 1960s , and the nationalization of industries by former prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto , Benazir Bhutto 's father , in the early 1970s , as moves against mohajirs . <p> The divide between the rural Sindhis and urban mohajirs could be seen in last fall 's elections . Bhutto was elected prime minister largely on the strength of her support from the rural areas of Sindh , while in Karachi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.5 percent of voters cast ballots . <p> When the party participated in elections for the provincial assembly two days later , however , 55 percent voted , and the party swept most of the city seats . <p> By last month , all but one of the party 's 27 provincial assembly members had been charged with criminal offenses , the party 's attorney said . Some face dozens of charges and its founder , Altaf Hussain , who now lives in London , faces 175 . <p> " Karachi is being punished for not voting for Bhutto 's People 's Party , and now there 's persecution and victimization , " charged Khawaja Qutubiddin Ahmed , an importer and past president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce . <p> Bhutto spokesman Haqqani denied that Bhutto has discriminated against mohajirs or Karachi , saying that the government recently approved a $ 750 million rehabilitation plan to build new schools and repair facilities . <p> " When the basic infrastructure troubles are improved , then we can tackle the political problems , because people wo n't be told that they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> But Jalil said the government 's priorities are backward . <p> " The solution to the problem is a change of heart on the part of the natives to grant rights to people they consider aliens , " he said . " There 's a lot of potential here , but it can only be exploited if people have the power to run their own affairs . "
