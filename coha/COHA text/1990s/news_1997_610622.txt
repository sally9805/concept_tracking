<p> Savory cookies are the flip side of the cookie coin . These cookies skip the milk and go right for the Champagne at midnight . They can also join in the fun at any holiday cocktail party . The seasonings are herbs or cheese rather than sweet spices , and the fillings include onions , cream cheese or potatoes instead of fruits or nuts . Savory cookies make fancy appetizers , crackers , snacks or even side dishes . <p> The trick to making the changeover from sweet to savory is to choose recipes that do not call for a lot of sugar . Familiar sweet cookies become savory ones when I fill a rugelach cream cheese dough with browned onions or stuff strudel with cream cheese and onions . Using slight adjustments to techniques such as cooking onions until they brown or roasting sweet potatoes rather than boiling them can add a lot of flavor to the final cookie . What does n't change is that they remain as simple to prepare as sweet cookies . <p> These cookies lend themselves to waiting around for midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be kept warm in a low oven or on an electric warmer tray . Although I serve most savory cookies as appetizers or in place of bread , I 've also found them to be good side dishes . Roasted Sweet Potato Foldovers make an interesting replacement for the usual potatoes or rice , while crushed cheese ribbons can become croutons for soups or even a crunchy topping for a casserole . You can also freeze cracker-type cookies after baking them , or store unbaked strudel and sweet potato foldovers in the freezer until you are ready to bake and serve them . <p> CHEDDAR CHEESE RIBBONS <p> ( Makes 40 cheese ribbons ) <p> The secret to making these crackers so thin is double rolling . First roll the dough into a square about 1/8 inch thick , then cut strips of dough and roll the individual strips even thinner . To achieve the rich butter and cheese flavor characteristic of these crackers , prepare them with a full-fat rather than a reduced-fat Cheddar cheese . Use coarse-grained kosher salt for the topping . <p> 3/4 cup unbleached all-purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grated sharp white Cheddar cheese <p> Pinch salt <p> 2 ounces ( 1/2 stick ) unsalted butter , at room temperature <p> 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce <p> 1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper or hot Hungarian paprika <p> Kosher salt for topping the crackers <p> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees . Line 2 baking sheets with cooking parchment . <p> Stir the flour , cheddar cheese and pinch of salt together in a small bowl . Set aside . <p> Mix the butter in the large bowl of an electric mixer on low speed until smooth , about 30 seconds . Mix in the Worcestershire sauce and cayenne pepper . Add the flour mixture , mixing just to incorporate the flour . Increase the speed to medium , beating until a smooth dough forms that holds together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl , about 1 minute . You will see specks of cheese in the dough . <p> Divide the dough in half and press each piece into a square about 3/4 inch thick . Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refrigerator and unwrap it . Lightly flour the rolling surface and rolling pin . Roll the dough into a 12-by-5-inch rectangle about 1/8 inch thick . Trim the edges even . Using a large sharp knife , cut four 3-by-5-inch strips . From each strip , cut five 3-by-1-inch strips . <p> Slide a thin metal spatula under the dough to loosen it from the rolling surface . Separate each strip and roll each to 4 inches long and about 1/16 inch thick . ( The strips can be cut into 2-inch lengths , if smaller crackers are desired . ) Transfer the crackers to the baking sheet , placing them 1 inch apart . Repeat with the second piece of dough . Sprinkle each cracker with a few grains of kosher salt . <p> Bake one sheet at time until the edges of the cheese ribbons are light brown and the center is just golden , about 6 minutes . They should not become brown all over . Bake the remaining pan . Cool the cheese ribbons 5 minutes on the baking sheet then transfer to a wire rack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tightly covered clean metal tin up to 5 days . <p> Per ribbon : 33 calories , 1 gm protein , 2 gm carbohydrates , 2 gm fat , 7 mg cholesterol , 1 gm saturated fat , 85 mg sodium <p> CREAM CHEESE AND ONION STRUDEL <p> ( Makes 36 pieces ) <p> This strudel has phyllo pastry filled with sauteed onions , cream cheese and Swiss cheese and is served hot .

Top with a fourth phyllo sheet . <p> Leaving a 1-inch exposed edge all around the pastry , spoon 1/3 of the cheese filling ( about 3/4 cup ) in a 1 1/2-inch-wide strip along the 14-inch edge nearest you . Fold in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the filling and roll up tightly . Brush the top lightly with melted butter . <p> Place the strudel seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet and use a sharp knife to mark 1-inch pieces on the top of the pastry . Repeat the steps to form 2 more strudels , placing the strudels about 2 inches apart . <p> Bake the strudels in the preheated oven . ( Or , roll each strudel tightly in heavy aluminum foil and freeze for up to 3 months . ) Bake until the tops are golden , about 25 minutes ( 30 minutes if frozen ) . Reverse the baking sheet after 15 minutes . Cool the strudel for 10 minutes on the baking sheet . Cut at each mark into individual pieces . Serve warm . <p> For a continuous supply of warm strudel for a party , bake the rolls one at a time . Or , cover baked strudel loosely with aluminum foil and keep it warm for up to 1 hour in a 200-degree oven . <p> Per piece : 77 calories , 3 gm protein , 3 gm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 gm saturated fat , 73 mg sodium <p> ONION RUGELACH <p> ( Makes 32 small pastries ) <p> Traditional rugelach have a cream-cheese pastry filled with fruits and nuts and are formed into a crescent shape .
