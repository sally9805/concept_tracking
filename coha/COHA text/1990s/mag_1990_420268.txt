Section : INVESTING <p> Expanding petrochemical plants around Houston will keep business growing for the Kirby Corp. , whose Dixie Carriers subsidiary is a top barge operation <p> Some places are hot while others are not . Here are six regions where savvy investors will make money in the 1990s . <p> Look northwest , young investor . Let 's say that three years ago , you wisely saw a bonfire building in exports from Oregon and Washington , sparked by strong airliner and timber sales to Europe and the Far East . So you bought shares in the Composite Northwest 50 Index , a mutual fund that holds stocks tied to that region 's economy . Since then , while few money managers have beaten the overall stock market , you and your fund have prospered : Composite Northwest scored a total return of 55.7% , nearly 11/2 times better than Standard &; Poor 's 500 . <p> The moral of this tale : in the eight years since the last national recession , a pattern of powerful regional business cycles has taken shape , offering opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key players . National business cycles have n't been repealed entirely . Softness in enough parts of the economy could still produce a countrywide recession , but that is less likely than in the past . " Now we have a more diversified economy , where exports and other international factors play a bigger role , " explains chief economist Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache . <p> To choose the best regions for investors in the 1990s , we looked first at projections of growth in jobs and population by the economic consulting firm DRI/McGraw-Hill . " Where jobs are expanding , that attracts migration , " says DRI senior regional economist Beth Burnham Mace . And that in turn fuels retail spending , adding more jobs and ensuring strong growth . Employment in the six standout regions that MONEY identified is expected to expand in the 1990s by 15% to 22% , compared with a projected 13.8% national average . Population in our six areas will grow 9.5% to 23%  --  against 7.2% nationally . <p> In addition , better climate and lower living costs in states in the southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people , according to DRI and U.S. census projections . And many economists believe that the federal bailout of failed savings and loans will boost the economies of Texas , New Mexico and other states where S &L; problems have been acute . By one estimate , over 30 or more years Texas could receive $4,775 more in federal funds per resident than its citizens pay out in federal taxes , thanks to the bailout . Upshot : the move to the sunbelt of the 1970s and early 1980s  --  interrupted by the oil bust in the mid- ' 80s  --  is resuming . That explains why most of our hot regions are in the sunbelt . <p> We ranked the regions on the basis of investment opportunities . For example , the Southwest outside Texas  --  an area that is expected to be tops in both jobs and population increase  --  stands only third on our list because of a paucity of large , publicly traded companies positioned to cash in on that growth . Our advisers ' picks are either in businesses dependent on a regional economy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a region by its raw materials or transport system ( a barge line hauling commodities from Texas on in land waterways , for example ) . <p> How much money should you invest regionally ? Portfolio analysts note that the risk varies from region to region and cycle to cycle , but they generally recommend that you commit no more than 10% to 15% of your portfolio to such investments . <p> Here is a closer look at our six picks . Note that where individual states  --  Florida , Hawaii and Texas  --  have distinct economies , we have treated them as regions unto themselves : TEXAS <p> Bouncing back from a decade when its growth business was bankruptcy law , Texas is expected to outpace the national economy handily through 2000 . Job growth is projected at 1.6% a year , compared with 1.3% nationally . The Texas economy now lives and dies less on the swing in oil prices : energy accounts for 15% of the state 's economy , compared with 27% in 1981 . " Over the next 10 years , Texas will see steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Center for Economic Development and Research at the University of North Texas . Cheap office space and low living costs already have led 49 companies  --  including Exxon and J.C . Penney  --  to move to the Dallas area in the past two years . Office construction has begun in that area for a number of relocating companies , including GTE Corp . and MCI Communications . Forecasters also believe that housing construction will pick up in the next two years . All of this building should benefit Justin Industries ( recently traded over the counter at $16 ) , a maker of bricks and other building materials , with estimated 1990 annual revenues of $300 million , says research director Eugene Melnitchenko of the Dallas brokerage Eppler Guerin &; Turner . <p> Petrochemicals are also perking along , with companies planning to expand production by 15% for two major products , ethylene and propylene , in the Houston area . A major beneficiary could be $170 million Kirby Corp . ( American Stock Exchange , $10.75 ) , the country 's largest operator of inland tank barges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for environmentally clean natural gas , nudged by government regulation and an end to the oversupply of the past decade , will push up prices 25% by the early 1990s . They are recommending gas exploration companies such as $10.5 billion Enron ( New York Stock Exchange , $56.75 ) and $2.6 billion Arkla ( NYSE , $23.50 ) . <p> Fund of the Southwest ( 4.75% load ; 800-262-6631 ) invests mainly in firms doing business in Texas and five other states  --  Arizona , Arkansas , Louisiana , New Mexico and Oklahoma . Since manager Sharon Stone , 34 , took over the fund in 1987 and diversified into consumer-product companies , the $15 million portfolio has outperformed the S &P; 500 by three percentage points in 1988 , 1.2 points in 1989 and one point so far this year . ( The mutual funds cited in this article are sponsored by small to medium-size money-management companies in their respective regions . ) PACIFIC NORTHWEST <p> Even before its moist piney Vistas and superior cherry pie were getting prime-time praise on ABC-TV 's Twin Peaks , the Northwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life will keep them coming . Douglas Pedersen , an economist at the Security Pacific Bank in Seattle , looks for " a rapid inflow of new residents , plus strong income and employment gains . " Washington and Oregon are projected to add new jobs at about a 2%-a-year pace-double the national rate  --  in the early 1990s and 1.5% later on . <p> Pedersen points out that the region is coming off unsustainable boom levels : nearly 1.00,000 new residents and about 5% job growth in 1988 and 1989 . But new businesses have built in something this region never had before : stabilizing economic diversity . To its traditional mix of airplane manufacturing and lumbering , the Northwest has added a burgeoning technology sector . And soaring trade with the Far East  --  from importing clothes to exporting high-tech components  --  is fueling growth . <p> Foreign passenger-plane orders keep swelling the backlog at Boeing , which still generates 15% to 20% of Washington State 's economic activity . But after a nearly 50% run-up in Boeing 's share price so far this year , many analysts deem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr . in Seattle recommends two Boeing suppliers instead , both trading at a price/ earnings ratio at or below the stock market 's . Eldec ( OTC , $12.50 ) , with $110 million revenue , produces airliner parts ; $500 million Precision Castparts ( NYSE , $31.50 ) makes jet engine parts . <p> In the timber and paper business , torn over the endangered spotted owl , pending restrictions on cutting timber on federal land will benefit Weyerhaeuser ( NYSE , $25.75 ) , argues Whitlow 's Dain Bosworth colleague George Haloulakos . Weyerhaeuser ( revenues of $10.3 billion ) owns 2.9 million acres of timberland in the Northwest  --  double its closest competitor . <p> The Composite Northwest 50 Index Fund ( 4.5% load ; 800-543-8072 ) closely reflects the northwestern economy . The fund holds 50 stocks at a time within industry sectors weighted by their contributions to personal income in the region . Annual returns over the fund 's 31/4-year life average 20% vs. 13.5% for the S &P; 500 . SOUTHWEST OUTSIDE TEXAS <p> By the year 2000 , the lonesome mountains and deserts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . Nevada is forecast by DRI/McGraw-Hill to be No. 1 in both population and job growth , while Arizona , Colorado , New Mexico and Utah are among the top 10 states for both categories after growth picks up by 1992  --  though parts of the region are still coping with economies stunned by real estate problems . Casinos account for 45% of the Nevada economy , but much recent growth has come from small manufacturing companies in such fields as medical instruments and aerospace parts . Many are refugees from high-tax California , and unfortunately most are not publicly traded . <p> Among stocks you can buy , manager Sharon Stone of the Fund for the Southwest favors Southwest Airlines ( NYSE , $26.50 ) , with revenues of $1.1 billion and a heavy schedule of short-hop flights throughout the region . Industry analysts say Southwest is a low-cost airline with a high level of customer satisfaction . For income-oriented investors , Value Line analyst Guy Woodlief suggests $10.2 billion U , S. West ( NYSE , $36.50 ) , which provides phone service for all of the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rising business telephone use should keep the company growing , he says . Its dividend , already yielding 5.3% , could increase by 5% a year over the next five years , he adds . HAWAII <p> The Japanese appetite for Hawaiian land has kept a real estate run-up going at a time when markets elsewhere are melting . Honolulu housing prices rose 25% in 1989 alone . With Hawaii 's population expected to expand nearly 20% by 2000 , the state will add new jobs at a 1.7% annual rate  --  30% faster than the national average . " The real estate boom will continue because there is strong foreign demand for residential and commercial space and very little supply , " says Bert Dohmen-Ramirez , an investment adviser in Honolulu . <p> How does an investor enter this pricey scene ? Not through REITs or companies solely in local real estate , advises Dohmen ; they tend to be too heavily in debt . Instead , he suggests two companies with large Hawaiian real estate holdings that stand to benefit from Asian demand as well as other operations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenues of $770 million , grows sugar cane and operates the largest shipping line hauling freight between the islands and the U.S. West Coast . And Castle &; Cooke ( NYSE , $30.50 ) , with revenues of $3 billion , owns 98% of the island of Lanai , where it has just opened a new luxury resort : . The company also includes the pineapple producer Dole Food , which it plans to spin off soon . Dohmen believes that the two parts will be worth more than the current stock price . FLORIDA <p> With sand and sun and Mickey Mouse to attract tourists and new residents , Florida is forecast to be the decade 's second-fastest-growing state in population after Nevada . Retirees will be prominent among the arrivals , but jobs are also expected to increase at a robust 2.1% annual rate . <p> One way to invest in this vigorous growth is through $360 million Advanced Telecommunications ( OTC , $20 ) , which has 10% of the Florida market for long-distance services . Advanced , which concentrates on small businesses and offers below-AT &T; rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next five years , says analyst Robert Bolen of the regional brokerage J.C . Bradford &; Co. in Nashville . <p> And then there 's the Orlando play . In addition to the Mickey and Goofy gang , a movie studio in Orlando opened in June by Universal is drawing big crowds , including a flood of foreign visitors drawn by a weaker dollar as well as the Hollywood-comes-East ambience . A company positioned to profit from the fun-biz boom is Major Realty ( OTC , $13.50 ) , a $12 million developer that owns 274 acres adjacent to Universal . Hotel chains are inquiring about the site , the company says . Some analysts believe that its real estate alone may be worth $30 a share . <p> Another strong tourism entry is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines ( ASE , $24 ) , the nation 's largest such line . Look for Carnival , with estimated 1990 revenues of $1.4 billion , to more than double its earnings in the next five years , says analyst Richard Lilly , who specializes in Florida companies for the regional brokerage JW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise passenger capacity 50% by 1995 . SOUTHEAST OUTSIDE FLORIDA <p> This slice of the Old South  --  the Carolinas , Georgia and Virginia  --  will enjoy a 13% population spurt in the ' 90s . That 's not up to Florida 's dizzying 20% , but it 's almost twice the U.S. rate . The region is expected to add jobs at a healthy 1.4% a year , according to DRI/McGraw-Hill . The mild climate and below-average living costs will keep attracting companies and households from the Northeast and Midwest . <p> Southeastern regional banks , the best of which never took on many of the bad loans that crippled their cousins in the Southwest and Northeast , are a strong buy now , says research coordinator David Lee of the regional broker Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta . The stocks remain cheap  --  selling at price/earnings ratios about half those of the overall stock market  --  after being knocked down in anticipation of stringent federal audits that are now partially complete , says Lee . He recommends two big regionals " that have come through their federal audits with flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , based in Atlanta , will have nearly $50 billion in assets when it completes a merger this fall and becomes known as Avantor Financial . NCNB ( NYSE , $36.50 ) , based in Charlotte , N.C. , with assets of $68 billion , operates throughout the Southeast and also has a large Texas subsidiary that figures to profit in the years ahead . <p> Automation has allowed the textile industry to build new plants in the Southeast . Ted Price , chief investment officer of Wheat Investment Advisors in Richmond , favors Unifi ( NYSE , $15.75 ) . With a dominant position in the market for polyester fibers , Unifi can increase prices readily . Price notes that Unifi , which acquired a major competitor in 1986 , is now financially strong enough to expand again through more takeovers . The stock is selling at a below-market 11 times the company 's estimated 1990 earnings . <p> Southeastern growth will provide business for Ryan 's Family Steak Houses ( OTC , $7.75 ) , says Robinson-Humphrey analyst Bryan Elliott . Ryan 's , with $275 million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its 119 cafeteria-style restaurants aimed at middle-income families in the Southeast . Elliott projects 20% annual earnings growth over the next five years . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : As sure as owls hoot , logging limitations in federal forests will be a boon to Weyerhaeuser , which owns twice as much timberland as its nearest competitor . <p> BY JERRY EDGERTON <p> Reporter associate : Carla A.
