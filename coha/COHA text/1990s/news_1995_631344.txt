<p> For 20 years , Kathleen Klages suffered from painful periods . By the time she was 30 , they had become sheer torture . " On the first day of my period I could n't go to work , " she recalled . " I 'd turn white , break into a sweat and double over in pain . " <p> People told her not to worry , that menstrual pain was normal . But it turned out that her cramps were caused by endometriosis , a disease in which the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside the uterine cavity . Endometriosis afflicts an estimated 5 million women in the United States , and probably many millions more worldwide . And though medical science has progressed in its understanding of the disorder , the cause of endometriosis is still a mystery . <p> " It remains an enigmatic disease , " said Dr. Edmond Confino , a reproductive endocrinologist at Chicago 's Northwestern Memorial Hospital . " We agree that it 's treatable , but in many cases incurable . " <p> Several theories attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue from the uterus escapes into the pelvic cavity during menstruation . Another speculates that a defect in embryonic tissues causes some women to be born with endometriosis . Still another theory suggests that environmental pollutants such as a dioxin may play a role in the disease . <p> Endometrial growths  --  also called implants , lesions , nodules or tumors  --  can form inside a woman 's fallopian tubes , on the outside of her uterus or ovaries , and even on her pelvis , bladder , or intestines . Growths sometimes appear on lungs , arms or thighs , but only rarely . Like the endometrium ( the tissue that lines the uterus ) , endometrial growths are fueled by estrogen , a female sex hormone . But unlike the endometrium  --  which builds up , then sheds during the monthly menstrual cycle  --  endometrial growths have no way to leave the body . Instead , they become inflamed  --  causing pain , internal bleeding and the formation of scar tissue . Sometimes the growths rupture , spreading endometriosis to other areas of the body . Depending on where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproductive organs or intestines . Scar tissue can also interfere with the function of the bladder . <p> Endometriosis usually strikes women in their ' 30s and ' 40s , but can occur much earlier . Symptoms of the disease include painful menstruation and sex , heavy menstrual bleeding and infertility . Painful bowel movements and other intestinal problems can also occur . According to the Endometriosis Association , a research and education organization based in Milwaukee , such symptoms tend to worsen over time , but sometimes follow a pattern of remission and recurrence . <p> About 40 percent of women with endometriosis experience some degree of infertility , according to RESOLVE , a national consumer organization for people trying to have children . But like other aspects of the disease , the relationship between endometriosis and infertility is n't fully understood . One theory is that scar tissue blocks the fallopian tubes and prevents eggs from coming into contact with sperm . <p> Women with endometriosis can have children , but they might need help from technology such as in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) . " It really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ovaries , " Confino said . " If she 's 40 and has severe endometriosis , her chances of having a baby are dismal , unless she has assistance . " <p> Klages , who 's now 33 and works as a scrub nurse , managed to have a baby despite severe endometriosis . She and her husband , Gary , had been trying to conceive for several years before she was diagnosed with the disease . She later endured three corrective surgeries and two miscarriages . The couple were on the verge of giving up when she became pregnant again . " It was real scary , " said Klages , who lives in far northwest suburban Marengo . " We were worried about another miscarriage . We asked ourselves , ' How long can we keep doing this ? Maybe we have to accept that having a baby is not meant to be . ' " <p> But in early 1995 , Klages gave birth to her son , Garrett . And in November she learned she was pregnant again . <p> Infertility is a major issue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger problem . " I see just as many endometriosis patients with pain concerns as with reproductive concerns , " said Dr. Charles Miller , a reproductive endocrinologist at the Center for Human Reproduction in Chicago . " It can totally incapacitate women ( and keep them ) from their jobs and families . " <p> Mary Lou Ballweg is the president of the Endometriosis Association . In 1979 , after years of vibrant health , she became bed-ridden with the disease . " I had to crawl to the bathroom , " she said in a recent interview . " The major accomplishment of my day was to take a shower . " <p> But fortunately for victims of endometriosis , medical and surgical treatments of the disorder have significantly improved . " We defined the disease much better in the ' 80s , and there have been a couple of treatment advances in the ' 90s which are very exciting for patients with endometriosis , " Miller said . <p> Using an outpatient surgical technique called laparoscopy , doctors can remove endometrial growths without making a large incision or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slender device that enters a woman 's abdomen through a small incision  --  about half an inch long  --  and allows the surgeon to see what 's inside . The surgeon then uses a second slender instrument to remove endometrial growths . <p> But even laparoscopy does n't always solve the problem of endometriosis . Recurrence of the disease forces some women to have multiple surgeries over a period of years . Ballweg had a hysterectomy and her endometriosis still returned . <p> " Even the most aggressive surgical approach wo n't cure everything , " Confino said . " It does n't address the cause of the disease . " He cautions that surgery should be used judiciously , because of the risks of scarring and damage to the internal organs . <p> In addition to surgical advances , drug treatments for endometriosis have also improved . Lupron , for example , can shrink endometrial growths by temporarily interrupting estrogen production . But the drug is notorious for its side effects . " Lupron slams you into menopause , " said Kathleen Fitzgerald , a 42-year-old nurse who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Northwestern Memorial Hospital . Within three weeks of starting her Lupron prescription , she was having 25 hot flashes a day , plus night sweats , insomnia , headaches , mood swings and depression . Lupron can also cause vaginal and skin dryness , and shrinkage of the breasts . <p> According to Miller , a healthy diet can help reduce the spread of endometriosis . He recommends that women with the disease eat plenty of organically grown fruits and vegetables . <p> But before any kind of treatment can begin , women must first secure an accurate diagnosis . And that can be challenging , because some male doctors still do n't take women 's health complaints seriously . Fitzgerald , for example , went to a succession of doctors before she found one who gave her a laparoscopy and diagnosed her endometriosis . " The other ones told me it was all in my head , " she said . <p> According to Ballweg , it takes women with endometriosis an average of 10 to 15 years to be diagnosed . Doctors often tell them that the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear , or that the pain is imaginary and the woman should see a psychiatrist . <p> " It 's a very tough disease to treat , " Ballweg said . " Do n't leave it up to your doctor . Get active . You need a specialist , and you need to do your homework . " @x President Obama is now turning his attention to what could be a more far-reaching and revolutionary objective than even his much-ballyhooed economic stimulus plan : transforming America into a " green " society based not on fossil fuels but on renewable energy , conservation , and careful restraint in the production and consumption of energy . " This is about changing the future of our country in a way that gives us some security , gives us independence , and really captures what 's great about this country -- our ability to solve problems in ways that make us better , " says Carol Browner , senior White House adviser for energy and climate change ( interview , Page 34 ) . Reducing reliance on foreign oil -- one of Obama 's major goals -- is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jimmy Carter , and George W. Bush have pushed for it for many years , and Bush famously declared that he wanted to end America 's " addiction " to foreign oil in 2006 . But so far , little has really changed . What is different , according to senior administration officials , is a new zeitgeist . Obama believes that Americans are fed up with fluctuations in gasoline and home-heating oil prices , worried about reliance on unsavory oil-rich regimes , concerned about climate change driven by burning fossil fuels , and ready to modify their lifestyles to cope with the sagging economy and , they hope , save themselves some money . Even business leaders , who in many cases have opposed plans to curtail energy consumption as enemies of growth and an unwarranted intrusion into the private sector , seem ready for compromise , according to White House strategists . " No one 's worshiping at the altar of market fundamentalism any more , " says a senior administration official , " and so I think you 're going to see a very different political culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what government should do than about whether government should be . And I think that 's already a very profound kind of change . " Team Obama is increasingly trying to look at today 's economic crisis as an incubator for a huge social transformation toward the greening of America . " It is time , " Obama told a joint session of Congress , " for America to lead again . " Marching orders . Browner notes that environmentalists are now working with CEOs to find the best ways to reduce greenhouse gases , and many business executives have concluded that the time may be right to address climate change . " You even have CEOs saying , ' Even in this down economy , it 's better for us to know today what 's going to be expected of us in terms of how we use energy , in terms of greenhouse gas emissions , so as we come through the recovery we can plan for all of that . Give us our marching orders . ' " Adding to the new dynamic , Obama aides say , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he can for a " new energy culture " and is at least as committed to energy independence as any of his predecessors . The details , of course , all are still being worked out . The White House will have to negotiate with Democrats in Congress , along with at least a handful of Republicans . But Obama aides still predict " significant legislation " will pass this year . This may be overly optimistic , however , given how skeptical many lawmakers are about the cost and the expanded federal role that Obama envisions . For now , Obama is sticking to his campaign pledges , which included helping to create 5 million new jobs by investing $150 billion over the next decade in new energy development . Obama said that within 10 years , he wants to save more energy than the United States currently imports from the Middle East and Venezuela combined . He also talked about putting more than 1 million plug-in hybrid cars on the road by 2015 -- vehicles that can theoretically get up to 150 miles per gallon . He wants to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources such as wind and solar by 2012 , and 25 percent by 2025 . And he set the goal of implementing " an economywide cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050 . " Another component involves persuading individual Americans to change their ways in an attempt to " exalt the concept of responsible citizenship , " a key aide says . " People have to become much more conscious about energy use , about where their energy comes from , " says Browner , " and I think that many people take seriously the opportunity to do things at home , whether it 's to use more efficient light bulbs , to buy more efficient appliances , to add insulation . " Encouraging this new culture was at the heart of the administration 's $787 billion package , which Obama signed into law in February . As a first step toward his long-term goals , it includes the nation 's largest investment in clean energy , with some $70 billion in spending and tax cuts devoted to renewable domestic energy , energy research , boosting green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes to conserve energy and save on heating and cooling costs ( box ) . The administration estimates that the full package will create nearly a half-million jobs by the end of next year solely from investments in energy transmission , improved battery technology , and energy efficiency . Obama has taken a particular interest in the " smart grid , " an ambitious project to digitally update old-fashioned electric wires across the country . Among the advantages , the new system would give homeowners information on how efficiently they are using electricity inside their residences . The smart grid also could send power from residential solar panels , wind turbines , and plug-in electric cars to be fed into the grid , and it would allow homeowners and small businesses to sell power to their neighbors or back to the grid . " It 's taken us 35 years to get as many renewables as we have today , " says Browner . " If we 're going to double that in the near term , part of what we have to be thinking about is how we 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a smart grid is a piece of that . " The full-scale grid would cost $400 billion over 10 years but save between $46 billion and $117 billion over 20 years by reducing inefficiency and power failures , according to the Department of Energy . Family affair . To Obama and his senior policy team , including Browner , chief economic adviser Larry Summers , and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , energy is an essential part of a much broader agenda . " The president has said many times that the test of the success of our economic policy is not measured in the health of the stock market , the credit spreads of the banks , or the level of GDP , " says a senior administration official . " It 's measured in the life experience of American families . And so if we are creating jobs , if we are increasing economic security by stopping the downturn , if we are addressing core systems in the economy that do n't work as well as they could -- healthcare and education -- if we are making the world safer for Americans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate objective of our energy policies , then I think we are doing the right thing for and by American families . " Obama 's energy agenda has been largely submerged so far beneath public concern about the economy and crowded out of media coverage by the financial crisis . But over the coming months , Obama 's goals for a green America will emerge as one of his most ambitious objectives , and one of the most difficult to achieve .
