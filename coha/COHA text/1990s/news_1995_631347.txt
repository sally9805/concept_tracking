<p> In the aftermath of the Beatles ' ballyhooed " return , " and in anticipation of Frank Sinatra 's 80th birthday Tuesday , we find ourselves on the cusp of celebrating the two most fearsome forces in postwar popular culture  --  not to mention the most screamed at . But , oh , what different vibes they give off ! <p> To revisit the Beatles via " The Beatles Anthology " was to feel a surge of uplift . Internal strife may have pulled the Fab Four apart , but they will forever embody the spirit of " All you need is love " and the most vibrant sense of possibility . <p> Sinatramania , marked by a TV special , " Sinatra : 80 Years My Way " ( 8 to 10 p.m . Thursday on Channel 7 ) , and the release of a mammoth , 20-CD set , " The Complete Reprise Studio Recordings , " is certainly an upper , too . One chorus of " Fly me to the moon " from the Chairman and we 're soaring . <p> But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It involves reconciling the sublimity of his singing with the less-than-sublime aspects of his personality  --  not just in theory , and not just in taking the long view , but every single time we hear him . <p> Soured by his sexism , bullying streak and penchant for bad-mouthing  --  to name three disagreeable ingredients in his " My Way " recipe  --  some people find nothing to enjoy in his songs . Where you stand largely depends on your commitment to great music  --  and your understanding of how Sinatra would n't be Sinatra were his smooth mastery not heated by rough truths . <p> " Everything I sing is real , " he once said . To Generation Xers who know him only from his career-climaxing " Duets " CDs , that may ring false . In duetting with famous , far-flung partners who did n't record their parts until weeks and months after he recorded his , he partook of the worst kind of artificiality . <p> But over the long haul , which is to say more than a half-century of owning popular music ( if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one came close to Sinatra ) , his brand of musical realism has rarely wavered . Honest emotion fuels his interpretive genius  --  sometimes sad or melancholic , sometimes wry or biting , always intensely experienced . <p> " Sinatra taught several generations how to deal with loneliness , " wrote Pete Hamill in a 1993 New York Daily News piece collected in the new Frank Sinatra Reader ( Oxford , $ 27.50 ) . <p> Francis Albert Sinatra also taught several generations of vocalists about the birds and the bees : A frank , innuendo-soaked sexual drive informs his songs , which forever rendered Bing Crosby 's school of chaste crooning as old hat . <p> No popular artist has meant as many things to as many people as Sinatra . Some fans still are in love with the Voice , the skinny kid from New Jersey with the heavenly crooning style who sent bobby-soxers into shrieking paroxysms in the 1940s , first with the Tommy Dorsey Band and then on his own . <p> Other Sinatraphiles believe his greatest triumphs came in the 1950s , when he moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Nelson Riddle , Billy May and Gordon Jenkins . After suffering a humiliating drop in popularity , Sinatra ( boosted by a 1953 best supporting actor Oscar for " From Here to Eternity " ) fought his way back with a voice attractively aged by hard knocks , enlivened by cocky charm and brightened by hopes for the future . <p> In leaping from the stark , despairing ballads of " In the Wee Small Hours " ( 1955 ) to the finger-popping wonders of albums such as " Songs for Swingin ' Lovers " ( 1956 ) , Sinatra effected one of the most remarkable of rtistic sea changes . <p> Beginning with " Wee Small Hours , " his albums seduced not only on a song-by-song basis , but also as self-contained productions . This was long before the Beatles pioneered the " concept " album  --  and Mr. " New York , New York " nearly totaled it with " Trilogy " ( 1980 ) , which buried a terrific disc of classic-style Frank under two discs of mediocre-to-awful " updates . " <p> When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulsing energy , lots of pushing and pulling in the arrangements . But to listen to " Swingin ' Lovers " is to be struck by its casual , relaxed charm : by the warmth and intimacy with which Sinatra swung Riddle 's wondrously attuned charts . <p> At this late date , everyone knows to praise Sinatra 's intonation , but not always with an appreciation for what makes it so compelling : his ability to communicate simply and directly with the listener on one level while rising to heightened meaning on another through the special weight of his phrasing . <p> A control freak in the best sense , Sinatra inhabits his songs with macho assurance . Lyrics have never been articulated , or interpreted , in a more manly fashion . But neither has any male singer been more graceful in making the words hug the curves of the melody . <p> Sinatra is n't regarded as a jazz singer , but he can improvise with the best of them through subtle adjustments in the internal wiring of his songs . Simply by altering the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reroute tone or meaning . U2 's Bono may have thought he was emulating the king of intonation with his sleepy , between-the-sheets vocal on " I 've Got You Under My Skin " on " Duets . " But in drawing more attention to himself than the song , he demonstrates how not to follow Frank . <p> Sinatra was guilty of self-consciousness himself in taking on contemporary pop tunes in the wake of the Beatles ' invasion . This was during his third major phase , when he recorded for his own Reprise label and most " popular vocalists " were scurrying to come up with " hip " material . <p> If you think " Somethin ' Stupid , " his 1967 hit with daughter Nancy , was the height of dumb , you have n't heard " Feelin ' Kinda Sunday , " one of the hippie-themed singles the duo cut in 1970 . <p> Largely because he indulged in crossover experiments ( ranging from his thrillingly soulful smash " That 's Life " to an entire album of songs by self-pitying commercial poet Rod McKuen ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy . But strip away such mediocrities , and you find what are arguably his greatest works . <p> Like Billie Holiday , Sinatra redefined his once-heavenly style by drawing divine dividends from experience . If his 1946 and 1963 versions of Rodgers &; Hammerstein 's " Soliloquy " were contestants in a boxing match , the earlier one would go down fast . <p> In " Soliloquy , " the epic centerpiece from " Carousel , " the singer muses over impending fatherhood . The ' 46 rendition is musically assured but , though recorded after the birth of Nancy and Frank Sinatra Jr. , rather callow . On the slower , more assertive and thoughtful ' 63 recording , a live extract from " The Concert Years , " Sinatra 's parental pride and understanding of the demands and complexities of fatherhood make for one of his most moving performances . <p> In 1971 , laid low by the death of his own father , Sinatra temporarily retired . Had he never come back , his legend would be no less imposing . When he did return , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by performing in the stadiums where rock bands ruled . <p> Never mind those shrill echoes of Howard Cosell introducing him on " The Main Event " ( 1974 ) , an album that ranks with Sinatra 's worst . In filling these arenas and establishing a high level of rapport where a high decibel count normally dominated , Ol ' Blue Eyes ( as the comeback kid was dubbed by his publicist ) proved skeptics wrong once again . <p> Sinatra 's concerts in recent years ( likely his final ones ) were marked by bungled lyrics , memory lapses and weird states of detachment . But he overcame those obstacles , too , through the sheer mastery of his style and a sense of courage even his detractors had to admire . <p> In the end , his kind of greatness becomes its own virtue . It does n't chase his character flaws any more than it validates the generous and compassionate Sinatra his friends speak of . But in absorbing and transforming his personality into such profound , life-affirming statements , his songs certainly tell you that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said and done , how many artists can that be said about ? @x Sustainability may be the new buzzword , but one of its most well-established routes -- and an industry that has , against all odds , trained millions of Americans to rethink waste -- is under threat . Like other industries , recycling is reeling from the recession . But its dependence on the commodities market , which bottomed out last fall , and its relative newness have made its sudden turn for the worse unprecedented . For the three quarters of Americans who recycle , that means the feel-good factor of dragging a plastic bin to the curb each week could be endangered -- not to mention the process 's environmental and long-term economic benefits . " The longer the recession goes on , the more communities will be forced to , perhaps , cut back , " says Ed Skernolis , executive director of the National Recycling Coalition . " These communities are struggling with their budgets already , and they 're going to take a hard look at all the community services and what the costs are . " Problems began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer 's historic highs . Before the recession , says Michael Benedetto , vice president and owner of Virginia 's TFC Recycling , he could sell aluminum cans for a dollar-plus per pound . Now , he gets less than 50 cents . Meanwhile , recovered paper and cardboard that could be exported from the New York docks for nearly $200 per ton in July fetched only $20 per ton in December . If prices are tough for recyclers , so is just getting rid of the material . Recycler Ed Osley , CEO of Vikoz Enterprises , says he used to sell a truckload of plastic a day to one client . But in November , he says , " I told my wife , ' I bet you they 'll stop buying in two weeks . ' They stopped buying in one week . " Vikoz lost up to $50,000 per month in revenue . Osley now has to get rid of the material elsewhere , an increasingly difficult feat . Across the country , recyclers are being forced to warehouse the trash they used to easily sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languishing in lots . The major cause of the industry 's woes is the global economic crisis . But adding to difficulties is the specific slowdown in demand from China , the largest market for the United States ' exported recyclables . China has been hurt by both the fiscal crisis and the end of the boom brought by the Olympics . Abroad or at home , though , the logic is simple : Less consumer spending leads to less manufacturing , which cuts down on the need for goods , like cardboard for packaging , obtained from the recycling bin . A plunge in prices follows . Recyclers see profits drop -- and may cut services . Back in September , for example , Boston 's recyclers paid the city $112 per ton of paper , says recycling director Susan Casino . By December , the roles had switched . Now , the city pays recyclers $5.50 per ton . But the real measure is how that $5.50 compares with the cost of disposing of recyclables by other means . Tipping fees at the dump can be $80 a ton . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowing as , to replace profits , recyclers make changes like charging haulers to drop off materials . And some communities where recycling is the costlier option -- such as those that are farther from recycling facilities than trash transfer stations -- already have buckled under the economic pressures . One is tiny Frackville , Pa . After the market bottomed out , the closest company that would accept the town 's plastic scrap was 45 miles away , a $94 trip with fuel and labor ; cardboard and newspaper had to be hauled 18 miles , at $38 . The trips were made several times a week , says Councilman Patrick O'Boyle . Or the town could drive the scrap to a nearby transfer station , for transportation to a landfill , for less than $20 . In a town that already had laid off two full-time workers and a part-timer to balance its budget , paying for recycling would have meant raising taxes about $125 per year per property owner , O'Boyle says . And so the town suspended its program . " We do n't have the manpower or the finances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad guys . " Insiders are quick to point out that recycling , like other industries , is cyclical . Towns like Frackville , they say , should be able to get their recycling programs back . Even so , those same insiders are impatient to see an upswing . " We feel confident that there will be a recovery , " says Wes Muir , spokesman for Waste Management Recycle America . " But , you know , when ? "
