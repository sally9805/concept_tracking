" Good heavens . " Rupert Giles , a folded airmail letter still clutched in one hand , stopped short in the doorway of his sanctuary  --  Sunnydale High School 's library  --  so suddenly that Buffy nearly crashed into him . " Giles  --  " He was looking about him in dismay . " The library is full of people . " " It is a library , " Buffy pointed out . " People are allowed in here . If they want . " " Well , yes , of course . But normally , it is , uh , strikingly empty . " Which , Buffy suspected , was how Giles liked it . Empty meant that he did n't have to go through the motions of being a high school librarian and could instead focus on his true reason for being in Sunnydale . That reason , of course , was to be the Watcher to the current Slayer of vampires , and to keep an eye on anything else that happened to come visiting the Hellmouth . Said Slayer being , duh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Slayer and her Slayerettes  --  Will , Xander , and Cordelia  --  usually sat , was filled with strangers : five chattering , gesturing fems and one guy , all a little on the old side to be your typical Sunnydale students . Then again , Buffy thought , what 's typical around here ? Werewolves , witches , invisible girls , Cordelia ... The strangers ' books and belongings were spread out across the table 's polished surface as though they owned it . Not exactly full of people , but she saw Giles 's point . They had definitely made themselves at home . A sight which did not give her warm and fuzzy feelings . Her library . Her librarian . " Ah , may I help you ? " Giles asked them all , shoving the letter he was still clutching into his pocket and doing a pretle of the Bands , you know ? " No , the man clearly did n't , so Buffy tried the brief version . " Oz 's band is going to be in a contest  --  lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all she 's thinking about . " " I am not ! " Willow protested again , more feebly this time . " Are too . Trust me on this , Will . Your brain has turned into happy gray mush . And what I was going to tell you , " Buffy continued to Giles , " is that I wo n't be able to make it this afternoon . It 's , you know , Quality Time with Mom Day . " Once Joyce Summers had gotten over the understandable shock of learning that her only daughter was destined to spend her nights chasing down demons and turning them into dust , she had , Buffy thought , managed to deal well enough . For a cardcarrying member of the mom union , anyway . The whole idea of a curfew for Buffy had gone out the window , which was a Good Thing , but a sit-down dinner at least once a week , complete with actual conversation , had been put into place with an iron fist . " I see , " Giles said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single , worried glance , as though he was afraid they were going to start playing catch with his precious books . " Quite understandable . Despite the knowledge that the more people who know of your , ah , other responsibilities , the more dangers arise , I ca n't help but think that this is a good thing . Contrary to everything I 've been taught as a Watcher , of course , but nonetheless , a good thing . You , um , will be , that is , you do still plan to study this evening ? " " Study ? " Willow looked downright puzzled . " Told you all she can think about is Oz and his band , " Buffy murmured . Red-faced , Willow said , " Oh . Right . Study . Lots of studying . After dinner . With her mom . " Trying to change the subject , she added , " So , any new books come in ? " " No . Willow , I 've told you already , I am not going to let you read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the student teachers , who were apparently immersed in their own paperwork  --  " the older books in the collection . " " You do n't trust me , " Willow said sadly . " He does n't trust me , Buffy . " " It is not a question of trust , " Giles cut in . " Not exactly . Ah , could we perhaps finish this conversation another time ? I have ... paperwork that I need to complete before Principal Snyder comes looking for me . " " Snyder ? Here ? " Willow squeaked . " Oh . I have class . Or something . Soon . Got ta go . " " Me , too , " Buffy added , and hurried after her friend , catching up with her at the doors . A low snort from the table in the wake of the two girls ' exit indicated that a ) the student teachers had not been as oblivious as it had seemed , and that b ) they already shared the prevailing opinion of the principal after only a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wary smile , Giles turned and all but dove into his office , closing the door firmly behind him . Once safely alone , the Watcher sank into his broken-down chair , looking once again at the letter he 'd retrieved from his pocket . And once again , a pang of alarm shot through him . A member of the Council was coming here . " Why ? " Giles muttered . " Have n't we proven ourselves already ? Over and over again , in fact ? " He glanced at the time ... good enough . He could call England , demanding an answer  - -  No . If the Council is testing us in some way , panicking like that would send the wrong message . Better to treat this visit as a normal occurrence . A routine annoyance . No need to worry Buffy about it , either . She has enough problems right now . Such as that dinner with her mother . Giles snorted . He was n't sure who to feel more sympathy for : his Slayer , or her mother . " Buffy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devote your entire life to helping me out . Just one evening . " Buffy pushed the food around on her plate a little , not wanting to look up at her mother 's face . It had been a really nice dinner up until this point . Well , okay , it had only been ten minutes . But setting the table had been fun . They 'd even been singing along to the radio together , the way they used to . " Mom , it 's not that I do n't want to . I know how much this opening means to you  --  " " How can you know that ? Tell me , Buffy . How many opening nights of exhibits have you attended ? No , scratch that . How many shows have you attended , period ? " Buffy looked up at that , indignant . " Three . There was the really cool fabric thing from Japan , the African masks exhibit , and the West Indian whatsis that had the really weird food . Xander thought he was going to need his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the triumph did n't last long . " The first one you attended because Willow wanted to go , and the second one your art teacher strongly suggested you all attend , for extra credit you needed to keep from flunking . And you all thought that the West Indies exhibit would have something to do with sun and sand and tanned guys in tiny swimsuits . " Buffy shrugged , contemplating the bit of chicken on her fork . " We had hopes . Your ads were false advertising . " " Buffy , all I want is for you to give me one evening of your time . An evening , mind you , that I 'm telling you about two weeks in advance . I do n't think that 's at all cruel and unusual of me . " " I know , I know . " Buffy wanted to help her mom out . Just not like that . The thought of standing around for hours , handing out canaps and refilling the punch bowl and making polite chitchat to art critics and newspaper reporters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was Important Art being discussed  --  plus a few cameramen to take her picture , natch  --  made school look appealing . " It 's just that we had made plans to go to the movies that night , all of us "  --  no need to tell her that it would be Oz 's last night of freedom before he went into the doghouse  --  " and I was really looking forward to it . " The **47;667;TOOLONG thing was always a good bet . Her mother looked like she was relenting , just a little , and Buffy moved in for the kill . " It 's not like I 'm slacking off , or anything . Really . It 's just that I need this break . It 's not like I do n't hold down a full-time job already . One , I might add , with horrible hours , no health benefits whatsoever , and absolutely no pay . " She paused , sidetracked by that thought for a moment , then decided that now was definitely not a good time to bring up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to be the one night I got to dump it all in someone else 's lap for a couple of hours and just be a teenager . You know , complete and total lack of responsible behavior ? Ca n't you hire someone to help out ? There 's got to be someone who 's good with that kind of socializing lurking around , right ? " Joyce Summers tried to be patient . She tried to be understanding , even with the added burden of being the Sla yer 's mom . But she was n't perfect . And so she fell back upon the age-old cry of parents everywhere , in every generation . " Buffy , honey , I 'm not made of money . I ca n't afford to hire anyone to help me out . So I 'm afraid that I 'm going to have to insist . " " But Mom , " Buffy began again , spearing a piece of salad with unnecessary vigor . " No , Buffy . That 's final . " Joyce sighed , finishing off her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking you to chop off your own head or something . I 'm not asking for an entire day out of your life  --  just an evening . A few hours . And you can even bring your homework with you , so after we get everything set up , you can get some studying done as well before the press arrives . " Ouch . Bringing the grades thing in is fighting dirty . Buffy took a deep breath , trying to calm herself . This was her mother . This was n't an enemy . This was n't a battle . " Mom . I 'm trying . I 'm busting my butt , in fact . You know that . And my grades are going up , so ca n't we ease up on the twenty-four/seven study thing ? " " No . " Joyce tried to smile . " Tell you what . How about a bribe ? You come help me out this one time , and I wo n't say a word about your study habits all that weekend . " Buffy chewed a mouthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mom happy , suffer for an evening , miss a night out with the gang , yeah , but a weekend free of mom nag ? " Make it an entire week , and you 've got a deal . " " Do n't bargain with me , young lady . I haggle with art dealers who 're tougher than half a dozen vampires every single day . " Her mom was joking , but Buffy knew that tone of voice . It meant she 'd pushed her about as far as was safe . Another whine , and the bribe would probably go the way of five-and-a-quarter disks . Some times , even the Slayer had to back off . A little . The moon was a pale sliver low in the sky , clouds scudding across it lazily . Buffy strode through the cemetery , Mr. Pointy swinging in a loose grip by her side . In a weird way , using the stake Kendra had given her made her feel ... tougher . A little more able to deal with the weight of being the Slayer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she warned . But it was an easy thing to fall into . Will had promised to patrol with her , so they could do the study-talk and walk , but her best bud had bailed on her to watch the Dingoes practice yet again : the Battle of the Bands , as Willow had reminded Buffy at least five times today , would take place at the Bronze at the end of next week . Oh no , she 's not obsessed , Buffy thought . Not much . Not that Buffy blamed her . Much . Hanging with your sweetie , even if he was totally involved in his music , beat stomping through the dead zone any night . They 're just lucky the Battle 's set for a non-full-moon night . Otherwise there 'd be that whole Teen Wolf thing to worry about . Gee , that would make the band really stand out , would n't it ? Except  - -  She froze in midthought . There it was again  --  that cold prickly thing along the back of her neck that had been tailing her the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ooky nonetheless . Buffy waited a bit , and it faded slightly . Great , now I 'm hallucinating . " I 'm sorry , Giles , could n't stake a thing ' cause I was jumping at shadows . " Not a good way to start the morning report , no . Not that there was going to be much to say . So far , the night had been a tot al bust . Not a vamp in sight , not even stupid ones . Just that weird feeling of being watched . And even that got majorly old after a while . Much more of this , and she was going to start getting not jumpy , but downright bored . Not that this is something I would be unhappy about . Mom 's right : Bored is good . In small doses . As Buffy moved on , she had an image of her mother , waiting up like she was on a date or something . If only ! The social life was definitely in dormant stage right now . A crackle of sound off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ! Jumping up on a low monument , Buffy scanned the surrounding tombscape . Nothing moved , not even a stray cat skulking through the underbrush . Geez , where is everyone ? The mall ? Is there a sale on I did n't hear about ? Shopping reminded her of the normal , everyday world . And that made her think of her mother again . Dinner , while good in a food category , had been a major ordeal for both of them . After they 'd settled the question of the opening , things had pretty much fallen apart on the conversation side . How much can you talk about before you get to the subjects marked Do Not Mention in big red letters ? Those subjects being Slaying , Slaying , and the ever popular Slaying . Finally , her mother had practically booted her out of the house to go on patrol . Which is just too weird . I think I liked it better when she did n't know . Kinda  - -  Something rustled right behind her . Buffy swung around into a fighting crouch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing there . " Man , " a voice said , " you are getting seriously wiggy . " Buffy jumped with a yelp and almost staked Xander . " He y , hey , hey ! Down with the big splinter , Buffster . It 's just me . " " You almost were wearing this ! " " Yeah , well , sorry . But I figured Will had Oz-ed out on you , which meant that you would obviously need company . And here I am , keeping-company boy . " " Cordelia dumped you , huh ? " " Sale at Neiman Marcus . Safer to hunt vamps than be around her right now . Uh ... speaking of which , how is the vamp-hunting business ? " " Nothing . Nada . Except ... " " Except ? " Buffy shook her head . " I do n't know . Like you said , wiggy . But ... " " But ? " " But I just ca n't shake the feeling ... what , I do n't know ... " " Hey , Buff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish a sentence ? " Buffy ran a hand impatiently through her hair . " I would if I knew what I was talking about ! Xander , all I can be sure of is this : Something is out there . But right now , I do n't know who-or what-that something might be . And  --  " They both froze , then whirled . Something was definitely there for a second , though they could n't see it clearly in the darkness , something big and seriously unnerving . And then it ... giggled . A high-pitched , definitely not friendly giggle . " What ... , " Xander got out . " Do n't know , " Buffy said grimly , getting a firmer hold on her stake and moving forward to find out . But it  --  whatever it was  --  was already gone .
