In the Beginning // In the beginning . . . the earth was without form , and void . // The darkness was over all . // - Genesis 1:1-2 // No , we 're not going back that far . I just mean my beginning . That 's how it starts for all of us , is n't it ? // My first recollection is digging in the sandy Michigan earth with a red toy shovel . It must 've been early spring , because only a few inches down the ground was still frozen . My first frustration . I was three ... perhaps only two ? I also remember picking up kindling for the kitchen stove from the backyard , and feeling the sharp edges of the split quarters of pine against my arms , though I was surely too young then to have chopped them , as I did later . I can remember my mother 's large mirror , which she 'd sometimes take off the wall and lay on her bed , so I could roll marbles around on it . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection of the room in the mirror , upside down and mysterious , like in Lewis Carroll 's Through the Looking Glass . ( Was I exploring imaginary worlds , even then ? I do n't think so . I was being a little boy. ) // I was n't born in Michigan , but in No Man 's Land . No , I do n't intend a metaphysical profundity . That was the real name of an unincorporated bit of Chicago 's northern suburbs where my parents , Russell Whitford Carter and Lilla Charlton , were living in a tiny house on the shore of Lake Michigan on land that 's doubtless now worth forty of fifty thousand dollars a front foot . // Please understand , I do n't remember this part of my life ; my mother told me about it when we left Michigan after she and my father were divorced and we moved back to Chicago 's North Shore . The house , really a cottage , was still there then . It 's long since been replaced by a twelve-story condominium. // Like all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infancy . My father having died a generation ago , the only qualified informant available is my mother . She 's not far from a hundred years old now , she being the only one alive who knows how far . As she 's been all the years of my life , my mother 's a woman of indomitable courage and wide interests , with very firm opinions on many , many subjects . // A couple of years ago , she phoned me . " Charlton , " she began . ( My mother has always called me Charlton . ) " I need to see you . " // " Wonderful , Mother , " I said . " Let me get you a plane reservation ; come for a visit . " No , that would n't do , she said firmly . She needed to talk to me in person , as soon as possible . This began to sound ominous . Was she perhaps seriously ill ? Had she decided to sell her house ? What could she not discuss on the phone ? // As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York the next week , where I was speaking at a banquet . I was due back on the Coast the next day , but we could easily stop for a couple of hours in Chicago on the way . That suited my mother best , she said . // The car met us at O'Hare and delivered us to her Wilmette home . She greeted us warmly , served us tea , and then said to me , " It has come to my attention that you have signed a contract with a publisher to write your autobiography . Since you have not discussed this with me , I can only conclude that you think I will not like it . " // " On the contrary , Mother , " I said . " I hope you will like it . I hope everyone will . I 'm sorry you 've decided you wo n't before I 've written a word .

Still , I did n't argue with her , or even try to stem the flow of her words , though given my own memories of my father , they were painful . I simply sat , listening . ( Lydia said afterward I never moved a muscle the whole time. ) // When she 'd at last finished , I said , " Mother , what you 've told me is part of your life . The only life I have even a chance of capturing on paper is my own . That 's what I have to try to do . You surely know I have no thought of hurting you . " That did not content her , I think , but she let it stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother has now lived through almost all of what 's surely a significant century for America . It includes a technological revolution unimaginable at her birth ; the Great Depression : two major wars and several small ones , often attended by one or another of her male relatives , a couple of them killed in the process . Both of her husbands died relatively young , as did two of her three children , both younger than I. Her only sister 's gone now , too . For four-score years and more , they shared ocean-deep , almost telepathic ties . Of my mother 's womb blood , only I survive - and she . // I think of my mother as a heroine from a Bronte novel - Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre . I cherish a photograph of her holding me when I was about five months old . We 're in a bleak , wintery woodland - there 's no snow , but the trees are bare . She 's wearing a full , heavy cloak with a deep cape collar . She holds me close against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap . Her hair is black and full , in slight disarray , her eyes glowing with fierce defiance , unafraid . I 'd know her anywhere . // While I have no early memories of Chicago , my , mother 's heart is rooted in that city . She was born there , of Scots/English stock who came to America through Canada . The Scots line is Clan Fraser of Inverness . The title and the lands were the gift of William the Conqueror as part of the spoils of his conquest of England in 1066 to one of his Norman captains , making him a baron in the bargain . The Normans were of course Norsemen , like the Vikings who had been raiding and raping along the Scottish coast for some centuries , thus accounting for the preponderance of tall , blond , blue-eyed males in our family - a blood strain I 'm very proud of . // The clan motto is in ancient Norman French : Je suis prest - " I am ready " - a good motto for an actor ( or a medieval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scots tend to thrive in any climate , century , or circumstance , but the Fraser best known to history was Simon , the Twelfth Baron . After the bloody Scottish defeat supporting Bonnie Prince Charlie at the battle of Culloden in 1745 , he avoided capture by the English so cleverly and so often that he earned the nickname " Simon the Fox . " Snared at last , he was thrown in the Tower of London and condemned to death as a traitor . On his way to the block , a woman in the jeering crowd taunted him , " They 'll cut yer ugly head off now , ye filthy Scots dog ! " // " Aye , so they wull , ye bluddy English bitch , " he retorted equably . And so they did . He was the last nobleman executed in Britain , and the last man beheaded in that country . Dubious distinctions , but there they are . We take our family memories where we find them. ) // My mother seldom speaks of her father , who was a professional gambler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and seems to have disappeared from family annals , at which point my grandmother took her two little girls home to her father . His name was James Charlton ; I think he was the strongest male influence in my mother 's life . // His photographs show a powerful , impressively bearded face that had the look of a man who understood his own life . He was a senior railway executive , more than moderately affluent . I guess he had to be . He lived in a large house , with a library of considerable distinction , where he maintained a household composed entirely of women . // As well as my grandmother and her two daughters , who were small girls at the time , and several servants , there were my great-grandmother and at least two of her other daughters , who were unmarried . Oddly , my great-grandfather also became my grandfather , many years before my birth . He adopted my mother and my aunt when he took them into his home , perhaps simply to give them a father . ( These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of his female blood kin , it 's clear that the center of his own life was his wife , an invalid who spent most of her day , in her rooms , in the company of a female companion - which made nine women in the house . // When James Charlton came home from his office each evening , he 'd hold the tip of his stick against the doorbell until someone answered it , then go directly upstairs to see his wife . He 'd visit with her for an hour , consuming two ounces of single-malt scotch and water , then , if she was feeling well , he 'd bring her down to dinner with the rest of his extended family . On such occasions , my mother often had the pleasant chore of carrying her grandmother 's train . // Almost a century later , it 's hard to flesh out the image of James Charlton beyond the easy take of him as a turn-of-the-century patriarch . Modern political correctness would demand that his generosity to the women who lived on his bounty be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no evidence of this . My mother has often pointed out that , though her grandfather supervised every detail of his household affairs with the same close attention he gave to his railroad , whatever his wife wanted done in the house was carried out without question or delay . // James Charlton spent only an hour or two a day in his wife 's company . When she died , he supervised every detail of her funeral , presiding in sober courtesy at the reception in his home afterward , which was attended by many guests . When they 'd left , he went upstairs to his own bedroom , got into bed , and was dead three days later . Clearly , his wife meant a great deal more to him than we might have imagined . // James Charlton left the many women dependent on him well provided for , though his considerable fortune was much diminished within a generation . My grandmother 's elder sister seems to have become the head of the family . My grandmother married again , and produced a son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother and her sister , May , went to good schools , traveled to Europe , and , at some point , my mother met my father . // Their marriage , which ca n't have lasted more than a dozen years or so , is to this day such a source of pain and bitter regret to my mother that it 's difficult for her to discuss it with any degree of calm , though it produced her two eldest children . It 's painful to me to distress her , so we avoid the subject . // It 's possible that they met while my father , Russell , was going through boot training at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center north of Chicago before serving in the Mediterranean in World War I. I doubt this , though . My mother would still have been a teenager ; her background makes it unlikely that she 'd meet a sailor on liberty . I think they met a year or two earlier in Michigan , in the hamlet of St. Helen . Certainly my mother and her sister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the war . I believe that 's where my parents met. // My father was a good-looking man of immense charm , with a rich bass voice . ( The latter was perhaps his most useful bequest to me - it 's gotten me a lot of parts . ) He was the second son of John Carter , who 'd been a pit boy in a Yorkshire coal mine at the age of seven , then somehow made his way to America and a measure of success . Like most men who 've succeeded on their own , he was a firm conservative . But at the height of World War II , when President Roosevelt threatened to jail John L. Lewis , the radical leader of the United Mine Workers Union , for striking the miners in wartime , my grandfather said in an interview , " You ca n't pay a man too much money to dig coal . " // I remember him only as a somewhat portly man with a house on top of a hill and a gold chiming watch he 'd let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a young man , when he seems to have roamed around the country , starting a family in San Diego , where my father was born , and a magazine in St. Louis , Carter 's Weekly , which later became Redbook. // What brought him to Michigan around the turn of the century was opportunity , though how he perceived it I ca n't imagine . He had somehow discovered that the County of Roscommon was about to dissolve as a governing entity of the state because the Stevens Lumber Company , having logged the northern half of Michigan , had no further use for the land and planned to abandon it to avoid further tax liability . John Carter offered to put the county back on the tax rolls in return for title to half its land . I gather he was often hard-pressed to meet this obligation ( perhaps that was why he sold his magazine ) , but he managed to bring it off , nonetheless . // All my early memories , to my mother 's intense annoyance , are of the Michigan woods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the loggers - great mossy cathedrals of hundred-foot pines blocking the sun , denying any undergrowth on the flat forest floor . In the decades since the timber operations had shut down , the second-growth trees had proliferated , too ; not only the dominant white pine but a range of smaller evergreen , birches , maples , some oak , as well as all sorts of wild fruit trees , berries , and ferns that have no chance of sustenance in a virgin forest . It was wonderful country for a boy . // Wild game was plentiful , of course , as it still is , though the larger predators had disappeared by then , migrated north over the Mackinac Straits to Canada . I never saw a moose there , or a timber wolf , though there were a few black bear , and occasional wolverines . It was the edible game that concerned people who lived in St. Helen - white-tailed deer , principally ; also partridge and duck when they flew south in the fall along the great flyway from Canada . Rabbit was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable game , of course ; if hung properly , venison is delicious , and a good-sized buck will provide a lot of meat . // Aside from my mother , just about all the adults in the settlement hunted , and all the boys over nine or so . There were generous limits on most game except deer . The yearly license allowed the taking of one buck per hunter , a limit generally respected , though certainly no one in the county ever went hungry , for want of venison. // There was no hunting in the summer , but there were three lakes within a mile or so of my house , with plenty of good pan fish - bullheads , bluegills , sunfish , northern pike , a few bass . // You could fish in the winter , too , which I enjoyed a lot more . By the end of November , usually , the ice on the lakes was thick enough to drive a truck on , towing a fishing shanty behind on runners . They were sturdy little structures , about six feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain benches around a square hole cut in the floor . Under that , a hole was cut in the ice . With the stove going and the door shut , it was comfortable even at ten and twenty below zero , as it often is in Michigan in the winter . // We fished with a spear , some six feet long , with three sharp tines - like Neptune 's trident . The bait was a handmade wooden fish about eight inches long , weighted with lead and suspended from fish line fixed to the roof over the hole . // Like most fishing , it was a very sedentary sport , but there was a certain cozy , contemplative comfort , especially for small boys , sitting there in the warm dark with the men , the wind hissing over the ice outside . The water beneath your knees was green , translucent . You swam your little wooden fish in lazy eights till the dark shape of a pike drifted into range to inspect your bait . Then you speared him ( more easily than you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the door on the ice , where he froze in a minute or two . // Hunting is a solitary occupation , unless you count the crowds of city guys who crash around in the woods together in deer season , drinking beer and scaring off all the game . When I was a boy , we hunted for the pot , usually alone . Partridge was the most reliable game , plentiful in the Michigan woods . They 're not much smaller than a chicken , though a good deal harder to hit . In fact , I found them all but impossible . A covey of partridge exploding out of the brush five yards ahead of you is a startling experience . The first few times I tried it , in my dad 's company , I was seriously overgunned , using a borrowed .20 gauge with a stock too long for me . To this day , I am an inadequate wing shot . ( In vast areas of this country , that 's a serious character flaw . The appropriate , modest appraisal of a neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) // I did contribute my deer to our table before we left Michigan , but most of my hunting was with a .22 rifle , after rabbits . If you know anything about guns , rabbits , or boys , you know the rabbits were not in much danger , though eventually I managed to bring home a meager bag for the pot . // In addition to marksmanship and the ability to read cover and move through it quietly , hunting requires patience and concentration . Life has lent me these qualities since , but I lacked them as a boy . It 's then that the firm hunter 's discipline wavers a bit . Often I found it more interesting to stop being a little kid with a cold hunting rabbits with a single-shot .22 and become Davy Crockett hunting renegade Comanche with a long rifle . I did that a lot . // Pretending to be other people . All kids play such games , of course , but I did it more than most , I think . The books my parents read to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to be : Tom Sawyer and Injun Joe and Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver , Huck Finn and Nigger Jim , plus all the larger animals in Ernest Thompson Seton 's Lives of the Hunted . I crowded the woods with them all , mostly by myself . // I went to school too , of course . It was a one-room frame building with a bell in a squat steeple , just over a mile through the woods to the crossroads ( a graveled two-lane and a dirt-trail road ) that , along with the railroad tracks , defined St. Helen . There were thirteen pupils in eight grades , three of whom were my cousins . The teacher was a strong young man with his hands full . In addition to keeping the school clean , the stove going , and the students in order , he had to teach us reading , penmanship , history , geography , and arithmetic at every grade level . Well , almost every level . There were a couple of grades with no pupils ; mine had only me. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how to read . True , at first I really did miss the basic concept . My parents read to me all the time at home . When they 'd gone over my reading assignment with me once or twice , I was able to get through it in school the next day with only an occasional stumble . I was quite proud of my progress , until one day , I suddenly got the idea : you were supposed to be able to read things you 'd never heard before . I 've always had a quick memory ; I was simply memorizing each lesson in turn . I can still remember my surge of delight at realizing I could learn to read anything . I 've never gotten over the infinite wonder of that . // I have no idea how good our teacher was , though he was clearly industrious , juggling his whole curriculum at several grade levels every day . However taxing this may have been for him , it had advantages for us . We sat at individual desks with hinged tops covering book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I remember on winter mornings before the stove had heated the room , the ink would be frozen ; you 'd dip your pen and get only a dull click ) . There was a wide bench at the front of the room where the two or three pupils reciting would sit while the rest of us worked on other assignments . // I was able to listen to the lessons at the front of the room , however peripherally ; I also got one-thirteenth of the teacher 's time . Not many school children today are so fortunate . // I had no close friends , really . True , there were my three cousins , but one was older than I , one younger , and one a girl . Besides , they lived several miles away over a rutted one-lane trail winding through the woods behind our house , so little used that the birch branches slashed across the windshield as you drove . We did go to each other 's birthday parties . I do n't remember feeling lonely , though , or ever afraid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any big city . I was n't " being brave , " it was just that I knew there was nothing there to hurt me. // I did get lost once , wandering in the deeper woods on the other side of the state road , where there were no houses . After an hour or so of looking for trees with moss on what I 'd been told would be their north sides , and taking a bearing from the sun , which kept disappearing behind the clouds , I got a little anxious . ( Half a lifetime later I made a film , The Mountain Men , about the fur trappers in the Rockies in the 1830s in which my character insists , " Ai n't never been lost . Been fearsome confused once or twice , mebbe . " That was me , thirty years earlier. ) // About then , I stumbled on the railway tracks . While I was trying to decide which way to follow them , a handcar came along and gave me a ride back to St. Helen . I even got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // More often , I roamed the woods nearer my house . We acquired a dog , a very large , dark-coated shepherd named Lobo . Of course I loved him , cherishing my understanding that he was part wolf . ( I doubt now that this was true . ) He was the first of three great dogs among the many in my life . In winter , he could easily pull me on my sled ( when he felt like it ) , allowing me to play out The Call of the Wild . The autumn I was nine Lobo was shot by an angry neighbor whose dog he 'd mauled in a fight . It was the first loss of my life . I still think of him . // Living in the woods , we had no sidewalk to shovel nor lawn to mow , and there was no point in raking leaves . I did learn to split kindling for the kitchen stove , using a single-bit ax as my father taught me . My younger cousin , wandering behind his older brother while he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the head on the backswing . " A boy ca n't handle a double-bit " was my father 's pronouncement . " That 's a lumberman 's tool . " // Actually , I liked chopping wood ( as did Abraham Lincoln , Kaiser Wilhelm , and Ronald Reagan , though I adduce no trickledown virtue from this ) . It gave me a feeling of useful work , reducing small logs to stacks of sweet-smelling kindling so my mother could cook dinner . The genes are involved here , too , I think . Man 's dominance over the other territorial carnivores was earned in part with the edged flint ax . // It was n't frontier life , though . We had running after and central heating , with a furnace burning larger logs than the ones I split for the kitchen range . We also had electricity , generated by a two-cycle diesel engine . Every so often , it came up to speed in a tonal range that would snap the stems on a couple of dozen cut-crystal glasses my mother kept in a glass cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother would call for me and we 'd race to lift them to safety . Unlike her , they were too fragile to survive their time in the North Woods . // Even so , I think my mother may have felt a little like those crystal glasses , marooned in the wilderness . If that 's true , she never told me , nor so far as I know , my father . If they quarreled , I never heard them . I think she was determined to play out the hand she 'd been dealt . // However mismatched they may have been for each other , my parents were wonderful for me . This did n't change when my sister , Lilla Ann , was born , when I was six . When I was in the house , reading or refighting The Great War on the carpet with my toy soldiers , my mother was there , pointing me toward books , talking about the theater in Chicago , or playing Caruso records on the wind-up Victrola . She used to take me out sometimes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in the woods around the house , with my little sister . It was easy to get enough for the table , even with Lilla eating most of what she picked . I remember my mother most vividly in soft summer dresses , very beautiful . // My dad gave me time , too . He often took me with him , usually in a truck , sometimes with Lobo standing on the running board , with his front paws braced on the fender . He loved it . We 'd rattle over new-cut roads to inspect the various building projects the Carters had under way . They were building an earth dam I found fascinating , though I have no idea what it was for . It involved a lot of very loud explosions of dynamite , diverting streams , and draining swamps , which was enough for me. // In memory , my father is dressed for the field , in khaki shirt , open collar , and rolled-up sleeves , wide brass-buckled belt and britches , with tall boots . Indeed , the word " father " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps because they were a symbol of male stability . // I have a picture of him standing beside me in those clothes . I 'm perhaps eight years old , formally dressed for running away from home . I have on a white shirt and a black bow tie , certainly not my normal attire , with my knickers sliding down over my hips . I 'm carrying a miniature classic hobo 's bindle , which my budding performance instincts must have told me was an essential prop for my odyssey . // Unfortunately , I can no longer recall what boyhood trauma impelled my decision - maybe it was just an early career choice . I recall announcing to my father that I was running away , leaving it to him to pass the tragic news to my mother . He took it very calmly , which disappointed me . " Do you want me to drive you to West Branch ? " he said . " You could catch a train there , if you plan to go south to the city . " // " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , maybe just as far as the state road . That was fine with him , though I 'd better put a peanut butter sandwich in my bindle , just in case . Yes , he would explain it to my mother . So he drove me half a mile to the road and left me there , with a cheery wave . The photo was taken an hour later , when I 'd come back home , as dramatically as possible under the circumstances . I look relieved , my father looks happy , but unsurprised . // Actually , thinking back , I did wear knickers mostly , though certainly not a bow tie . Though my mother made most of my baby sister 's clothes , we , along with just about everyone in the village and in tens of thousands of towns throughout the country , did much of our shopping through the Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward mail-order houses . They were wondrous horns of postal plenty , announced in seasonal catalogues the size of phone books , the Spring/Summer version in March , Fall/Winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms , barbed wire to brassieres , and on through the alphabet . My first pubescent juices stirred while staring transfixed at the underwear models . ( They were in the first part of the catalogue , just after housedresses . ) I do n't think I could 've handled ads for a thong bikini . // My own clothing needs were simple . One pair of corduroy knickers a year , which I grew out of before they wore out , as I did the high laced boots boys wore in the winter . They came with a pocket on one side , containing a fairly good knife . In summer you wore shorts and sneakers . As far as I know , the only brand then was Keds , costing two dollars , not two hundred . // My boyhood memories are thick with trees - Midwestern oak , poplar , and maple , but mostly the birch and pine of the Michigan peninsulas . Even in summer , they dominated the other trees . In the fall , the fierce , bright colors of the maples flame through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of the hunters . But in winter , the days shorten early ; the snow comes soon . As the afternoon light fades , the pines darken against the white drifts , looming close to the narrow trail roads . // Walking through the woods in December , I felt no menace , only promise . It meant Christmas and finding the Tree . There was passionate local argument as to which kind of pine made the best Christmas tree . Blue spruce and balsam were the favorites ; our family was firmly loyal to the blue spruce . It 's dense , short-needled , and dark blue-green , and lasts the longest if it 's cut and handled properly . // I feel sorry for people who buy their trees from city , tree lots , packed with stubby fledglings grown for the trade each year . A proper Christmas tree is cut from the top ten feet or so of a mature , forty-foot pine , the top being the newest growth , full of sap that holds the needles longer . Felling such a tree is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . when the tree toppled in an explosion of snow , I helped trim the branches from the fallen trunk . When this was cut into short logs for burning in the furnace that heated our house , I helped load them on the truck , too . The Tree was loaded last , clotted with packed snow from its fall . Trucked back to the house , it was stuck in a snowdrift against the front steps . Then came a dreary hour of boy 's work , throwing the heavy logs from the sawed-up trunk through the cellar window to feed the furnace . // We never put our tree up until Christmas Eve . For a few years I knew this was Santa 's work , then I joined in the sweet deception for my little sister . Everyone knows the pleasure of transforming a tree into a Christmas wonder , the arguments about how many ornaments , which kind of icicles , the frustration of stringing lights . Then , we used candles the size of your finger , clipped to the branches in tiny tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . ( So were fireworks , but we all had those , too , on the Fourth . ) By God 's grace and my parents ' care , we never had a fire . The candles were incomparably beautiful , glistening and glimmering among the branches as light bulbs never have since . // I do n't need to describe a tree on Christmas morning - we all know that delight . In California now , our Tree still comes from the woods of my boyhood , trucked two thousand miles - not two thousand yards . It 's taller , because our ceiling 's higher . But I do n't get to go out in the dark , snowy woods on a winter afternoon and watch it fall , crashing in a cloud of snow for Christmas . I ca n't sit through Christmas afternoon behind the Tree in a window seat hidden from the house , devouring my Christmas books . My first copies of Treasure Island and Tom Sawyer still have some blue-spruce needles scattered in the pages . They smell of Christmas still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyspace of home , pine woods , and books . Once , though , as I was walking on the edge of a cleared cow pasture by the state road , I heard what sounded like an outboard motor overhead . I looked up and stood dumbstruck to see an actual airplane come stuttering down to a landing - just like in the movie Wings . The pilot climbed out , yes , boots and a leather jacket with a white silk scarf - I felt as if we were in a movie , somehow . He pulled off his helmet and goggles and tossed them into the cockpit . " Hey , sport , " he said ( no one had ever called me " sport " before . It sounded very grown-up ) . " Y'know where I can get some gas - maybe a sandwich ? " I directed him to the most impressive building in St. Helen , which belonged to my grandfather and lay a few hundred yards across the railway tracks , at the foot of my grandfather 's hill - a cobblestone store which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only gasoline pump in fifteen miles . // The pilot was blond and curly-haired ( could it be Lindbergh ? ? ! ! ) . He started across the field with a couple of gas cans . " Do n't steal my airplane now , sport , " he called back . I did n't dare go near the plane , fragile and wondrous as a great bird , but stood staring for a time , then bolted off to find my dad , anybody , to bear witness to this miracle . Of course I found no one ; as I ran panting back to the pasture , I heard the motor start . The plane was bumping over the rough ground , lifting clear and banking south its I climbed the fence . I do n't think he saw me wave . // There was also an Indian when I was a boy . He lived , for a time , in a small cabin on the Au Sable River , a mile or so north of the schoolhouse . He was probably a Chippewa ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know that then , nor anything else about him . I have no idea whether he built the cabin , owned it , or was squatting there . Wandering along the river bank one afternoon , in search of whatever it is boys look for , I came upon him sitting in his doorway repairing some beaver traps . // Beaver were prevalent in northern Michigan then , as they are still , busily cutting down a lot of poplar , building dams , and flooding trail roads . I had two rusty traps myself , though I 'd barely learned how to set them , and had no clue how to bait or place them . The beaver were safe from me , though visions of beaver pelts danced in my head - at twenty-some dollars apiece , they positively leapt . This man clearly knew about trapping beaver. // Besides , he was an honest-to-God Indian ! No , he did n't have a bear-claw necklace or braided hair , but his flat , obsidian eyes and iron focus on the work he was doing defined him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thirty feet away , for some minutes . Then he stood and strode off into the woods with his traps , turning a casual eye to me as he passed , neither accepting nor rejecting , just marking my presence . // I went back several times over the next weeks . Often there was no sign of him , no smoke from the chimney ( but it was still a real Indian camp ) ! Even when I saw him , he never spoke or more than flicked a glance at me , till one day when he was splitting kindling by his woodpile . He stopped and leaned on his ax . " What you want here , kid ?

" // " Sure I do . Yes , sir . " I did , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't often ask me questions for which I had good answers . // " This here 's all cut . " He sank the ax deep in the chopping block , with a one-handed swing . " Come back next week . Maybe I 'll give you some work . " I did go back , every day the next week , but there was no sign of life around the cabin , and the ax was gone from the chopping block . I do n't know the meaning , or the ending of that story . I remember it , though . // I did n't speak to a full-blood American Indian again until many years later , when I was made a blood member of the Miniconjou Sioux in the Black Hills of South Dakota , while I was making a film about them , The Savage . In Texas , on another film , Arrowhead , I worked with some Chiricahua Apache , including a very old chief who , tribal lore held , had fought against the Long Knives ( that 's what the Apache called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever met burns as vividly in my memory as that solitary , proud Chippewa I met on the banks of the Au Sable when I was a boy .
