High-energy breakfasts and brunches for active autumn weekends <p> YOU DO N'T HAVE TO TRAVEL TO CALIfornia 's redwood forests to get a taste of Skylonda fitness retreat . <p> We 've brought the flavors home for you ... and just in time for America 's most spectacular hiking season . Wherever you live , woodland trails and nature paths beckon . And with these tips and recipes , you can be prepared for a high-energy breakfast ( or hearty posthike brunch ) designed to complement an autumn hiking adventure . <p> Skylonda 's executive chef , Sue Chapman , knows how to stoke an active person 's metabolic furnace . " Our breakfasts are designed to provide a generous amount of calories from complex carbohydrates , which provide a good , steady energy supply , " she says . And with fat intake under 10 percent of calories , these breakfasts must rely on fiber to satisfy the heartiest appetite . " It takes a lot of testing to develop recipes for wholesome , low-fat foods . I experiment with whole-grain cereals , oats , couscous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fat in muffins , pancakes and other baked foods , Sue relies on a repertoire of ingredients , including nonfat and low-fat yogurt , pureed fruit , egg whites , and high-protein gluten ( flour ) , which , she says , helps whole-grain muffins and breads rise better and gives them a springy texture . Whipped egg whites replace the oil in her ever-popular granola , a guest favorite . ( See page 104 for recipe . ) <p> For inspiration , Sue scours California 's fresh-produce markets , selecting only the sweetest seasonal fruits and vegetables . Then she plans her meals based on these choice picks . Fresh fruit usually constitutes about 25 percent of the morning meal , Fruit juice is conspicuously absent because it lacks fiber , essential in keeping blood sugar and energy levels on an even keel . <p> " If , instead of drinking a glass of orange juice with breakfast , you eat one or two pieces of fresh fruit , your body has to work harder to extract the sugar from the fiber and you get a more sustained energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains . <p> Brunch recipes make ample use of seasonal vegetables , which Sue selects with an eye for color . Sweet potatoes , pumpkins , winter squash , spinach and mustard greens are all richly colored and , not coincidentally , get gold stars for high nutrition . ( See page 129 for brunch recipes . ) TIMESAVING TIPS <p> For convenience , the make-ahead hints on page 106 can get you started . <p> Cocoa Banana Bread Batter may be made the night before and baked in the morning . This is a nice bread eaten cold ; or you can slice and toast it . <p> Cocoa Banana Custard All the ingredients except the egg whites can be prepared ahead of time . But be sure to beat and fold in egg whites right before baking , and serve the custard as soon as it comes out of the oven-otherwise the custard will fall . <p> Fritiata Layered With Sweet Potatoes , Spinach and Sage Maybe assembled as many as 12 hours ahead and baked when needed . The Sweet-Potato Biscuit batter may also be made 12 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature before baking . <p> Polenta Pudding With Warm , Nutmeg-Scented Pears The polenta may be made up to two hours ahead of time and , kept on a warmer . To avoid lumps , do not allow it to cool . The pear sauce may also be made ahead and then warmed before serving . It is possible to reheat and whisk with a beater , but the consistency changes . <p> Savory Brown-Rice Pumpkin Pie With Cinnammon-Cayenne ' Gravy ' Assemble pie no more than 8 to 10 hours in advance or the greens and carrots will take on a strange color . The cayenne " gravy " really should be made no more than one hour before serving .
