<p> BE WARY OF MAKING WAR ON THE RIGHT <p> Editor  --  In his August 4 letter regarding the murder of an abortionist and clinic escort in Florida , Glenn Churchill stated that the second American Civil War has started . He warned Americans , saying that we " need to unite to stop the right  --  now . " <p> It 's hard to believe that anyone could insist that something has to be done about every right-winger in the country because of the violent actions of one or two people . Every special-interest group has their own radical extremists . The environmentalists have them , the homosexuals have them . Both political parties have them , and , yes , even right-wingers have them . But is that any reason to condemn the whole group because one or two act irrationally ? <p> My question : What does Mr. Churchill suggest we do ? Do we declare war and start shooting right-wingers , or do we simply throw them to the lions ? Shall we make it illegal to be a right-winger , or shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express their opinions in public , since they might inflame a few simple-minded people ? <p> If Americans really care about their democracy , they better not underestimate the seriousness of the threat posed by people who think like Mr. Churchill . If too many people start listening to the likes of him , we will indeed become the Balkans of the Americas . <p> RICHARD CARLSON <p> Moffett Field <p> . <p> CROSSING THE LINE <p> Editor  --  So Mary Ellen Eiler , coordinator of Pro-Life Activities for St. Mary 's Cathedral , wonders what the 1,000 cases of " abortion-related violence since 1977 " is ( Chronicle , August 4 ) , and insinuates that this number is somehow exaggerated . Well , Ms. Eiler , if you are going to be actively involved in a cause , you need to educate yourself on " your side 's " activities . While this number obviously does not represent murder or attempted murder cases , thank God , it does represent other serious criminal activities such as stalking , assault and arson ( terrorist activities , in my opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Throughout the country there have been numerous cases of serious threats made against clinic workers and doctors . Many of these people fear for their lives . What about their freedom ? <p> Peaceful prayer at clinics is perfectly fine with me . But when groups bombard clinics , attempt to bar access , shout and scream at people trying to seek medical care , this is interfering with someone else 's freedom . Laws are now being passed to establish perimeters around clinics where uninvited protesters may not tread . This is because the line has been crossed between peaceful freedom of speech and criminal activity , and it 's too dangerous . <p> TERRI COOK <p> Belmont <p> . <p> RUSH 'S ' TRIUMPH ' <p> Editor  --  If Rush Limbaugh spoke the truth , he 'd say , " The wimp factor is contagious ; it 's made me millions ! " Right-wing zealots have thrown mainstream America into a state of cowardice and confusion , preaching partisan hatred . <p> They scream " Constitution " over an assault weapon ( for the coming revolution , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Second Amendment is n't nearly as important to our freedom as is the First . Jump on the Rush bandwagon , but while you 're bitching about Clinton 's Vietnam , remember it was his right , and it 's your right to disagree with government policy . Or is it only Clinton 's government we 're allowed to disagree with ? You griped about health care and welfare being out of control until Clinton took up your battle cry . Now he 's out to destroy your lives , take away your choice . Get real ! <p> What choice is there if you ca n't afford to take your kid  --  let alone yourself  --  to the doctor ? <p> DOMINIC A. INTRAVIA <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> BREAKFAST SPOILED <p> Editor  --  Today 's ( Chronicle , August 15 ) malicious , unfair editorial castigation of Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and his sage criticism of Senator Mitchell 's really stupid and naive unhealthy plan for health care caused me to react adversely to my breakfast , in the fury it engendered in me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempered by good sense , and not by some blindly partisan abuse of the freedom of the press , as you have so obviously committed . <p> You have no requirement to be fair , and you have often shown a pronounced lack of restraint , obviously because you are pandering to the left-wing crowd on the streets of your circulation area , which fortunately does not represent the thinking of the majority in America . <p> The relative anonymity may protect the writer from personal deserved abuse , but it really reflects adversely on the intelligence of whoever hired the " writer " ( more properly " mischaracterizer " ) and put that person in a position to spread such bilge . Instead of discussing the points raised , this cretinous defiler attacks the character of the person , an obvious irrelevancy , rather than the merits of the idea presented . A typical response of the neurotic , over-aged bed wetters promoting the left-wing party line . <p> R. S. ( RON ) ZIMMERMAN <p> Oakland <p> . <p> PREZ VS . A STIFF <p> Editor  --  President Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-wing Democrats . Forgive my yawn . <p> Clinton does not have to compete in the next election against a mythical " perfect candidate . " He only has to beat the likely Republican stiffs that he 'll encounter ( Dole , Gramm , Bennett , Kemp , Quayle ! ) . <p> The comparison is the American League Western Division . Prior to the strike , the A 's were only a half game out of first , even with a lopsided losing record , because they were in a notoriously weak division . <p> Clinton merely needs to remain the lesser of all evils , which is something I think even President Flip- Flop can achieve . Then , given the " discipline " of the Democratic Party , and the " statesmanship " of the Republicans , we can enjoy four more years of his getting led around by the nose . <p> GREG McVERRY <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> APPEASING CUBAN EXILES <p> Editor  --  Cuban leaders have been put on notice by our fearless State Department : " We will not allow Castro to dictate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , we prefer to take guidance from a notorious bunch of rich Cuban exiles based in Florida . Art Hoppe 's August 12 column beautifully skewers the U.S. attempts to appease those folks . <p> Later in the August 10 article we are told that the current Cuban economic crisis stems from the end of Russian aid . No mention of the 30 years of virtual blockade applied by a huffy United States . We have not only removed ourselves as Cuba 's generations-old natural trading partner , but have coerced nations around the world to boycott that upstart island . <p> Art Hoppe has been to Cuba . I myself was there last year with the Freedom to Travel Campaign . Funny how the perspectives of open- minded columnists and piano tuners change once we have actually been to Cuba after listening all our lives to the U.S. government line . <p> BENJAMIN TREUHAFT <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> OUT OF OUR POCKETS <p> Editor  --  Much has been made of the possibility that California might lose billions in federal aid if Proposition 187 , the immigration control initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the interest of clarity , I would like to point out that this is not free money . <p> We all pay taxes to both the federal and state governments . If the initiative passes , the billions in federal aid will therefore come out of our pockets just as much as the state money spent on illegal immigrants . <p> PAUL S. LARUDEE <p> Richmond <p> . <p> GET OUT OF TOWN <p> Editor  --  Good gracious gravy . Not only do we have a carpetbagger with a bagful of doubloons focusing his spy glass on our California Senate seat , but a New Age wife as well . I think we ought to huff and puff this carpetbagger/New Age couple right out of town . <p> JENNY HOUSTON <p> Fairfax <p> . <p> MORE ' RULE OF THUMB ' <p> Editor  --  Evidently , William Chapin of Sonoma had looked in all of the wrong places for the definition of the phrase " Rule of Thumb . " I found the following definition in " Have a Nice Day  --  No Problem , " by Christine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rough measure or method , without precise mathematical or scientific basis . This term has been around since the 17th century and made it into James Kelly 's collection of Scottish proverbs ( 1721 ) : " No rule so good as rule of thumb , if it hit . But it seldom hits .
