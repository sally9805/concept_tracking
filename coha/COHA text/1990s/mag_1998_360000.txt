Finding myself in London on Nov. 4 , I agreed to clear up any questions my English friend Nigel happened to have about how to interpret the American midterm elections . It 's obviously beneficial to spread understanding of the American political system abroad , and I 've never minded analyzing elections after the results are in . As the political commentators discovered once again this year , it 's analysis done before the election that 's very likely to make you look foolish . <P> " Let me see if I understand this , " Nigel said . " The fact that the voters said in the exit polls that they did n't consider the election a referendum on whether or not Clinton should be thrown out of office has been taken as proof that the election was a referendum on whether or not Clinton should be thrown out of office ? " <P> " Absolutely , " I said . " I think you 're beginning to catch on , Nigel . If you keep this up , someday I might try filling you in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So the fact that the election was seen as a victory for the Democrats means that Clinton will remain President because only the Republicans wanted him out ? " <P> " Well , not exactly , " I said . " The Republicans did n't actually want him out , because they do n't want to face Albert Gore as an incumbent President in 2000 . They wanted to go through the process of getting him out but then leave him in . The people who wanted him out were the Democrats , but they did n't want to go through the process of getting him out . What they actually wanted to do was wish him away . But , as I 've explained to you before , Nigel , the United States , unlike the United Kingdom , has a written Constitution , and even people who do not consider themselves strict constructionists agree that there is no provision in the Constitution for wishing a President away . It 's apparently one of the few contingencies that the drafters never considered . " <P> Nigel was still having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the election by ending up with a dozen fewer House seats than the Republicans  --  something that would not be true in the parliamentary system . <P> " As I 've tried to tell you before , " I said , " This is not the parliamentary system . In our system the winning party is the party that does better than anticipated , or , to put it another way , the party that causes the most embarrassment to commentators who insist on covering political campaigns by predicting results that everyone 's going to know on election night anyway . " <P> I reminded him that in American politics the party of a President almost always loses rather than gains seats in a midterm election . " It 's axiomatic , " I said . <P> But why ? " Nigel asked . " Why , exactly , does the President 's party normally lose seats in a midterm election ? " <P> There was a long pause . " I 'd rather not say , " I finally replied . You ca n't give the entire system away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that question someday , once I was satisfied that he understood the structure of the Iowa caucus system .
