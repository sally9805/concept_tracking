<p> ST . PAUL , Minn.  --  Like a good fan , Steve Sviggum maintains his Minnesota Twins memorabilia and memories . He has Harmon Killebrew 's autograph , remembers Bob Allison 's sliding catch in the ' 65 World Series and delights that his 3-year-old daughter , Marit , has a baseball given to her by Kirby Puckett . <p> But Sviggum , who raises cattle , corn and soybeans on a farm near Kenyon , Minn. , wo n't let baseball tradition interfere with his duties as a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives , where the Republican is the minority leader . <p> Sviggum is a policy-maker first , a Twins fan second . So , he 's leading the charge against a bill that would build a new stadium in Minneapolis and keep the Twins from leaving the Midwest . <p> " People across the country are starting to question taxpayer subsidies for stadiums , " Sviggum says . " They are starting to say , ' No , the nonsense is n't continuing . ' " <p> Indeed they are . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down  --  by a 3-1 margin  --  a sales tax proposal that would have included financing for new stadiums for Pittsburgh 's Pirates and Steelers . <p> Fears on both sides <p> Minnesota becomes the next battleground . One side fears the Twins will move and leave the area without professional baseball for the first time since 1961 ; another faction fears the Twins will stay and stick the taxpayers with the bill . <p> Today , the state House and Senate meet in special session to debate a plan calling for Twins owner Carl Pohlad to donate the team to a nonprofit foundation in return for a stadium that could cost as much as $ 404 million . The stadium would be funded by redirecting some taxes and using proceeds from a new state lottery game . <p> The vote is expected to be close . If it passes , the bill likely would be signed by Gov . Arne Carlson . <p> If it fails , Pohlad has approval from Major League Baseball to sell the team to businessman Don Beaver , who will move the team to North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . Wednesday , officials said 150,000 phone calls were attempted at the Capitol building . ( On a normal day , it gets 9,000 . ) <p> Ryan Kubat , a self-employed businessman from Owatonna , Minn. , says , " I do n't see why I should have to pay . If I want an office for a money-making business , I have to pay for it . If the players want a new office to make millions of dollars , they should pay for it themselves . " <p> Counters Caren Rutherford of Plymouth , Minn. : " It 's important to have the Twins stay . If this plan is what it takes , then that 's what it takes . " <p> No matter which way the legislative vote goes , the resulting action figures to be a first : <p>  --  In a decade when taxpayers have forked over millions to help finance ballparks and keep teams from leaving such places as Seattle and Milwaukee , Minnesotans would be the first to actually say goodbye to a major league baseball team because it did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation is approved , it would establish a model for community ownership . Under the proposal , a charitable foundation would hold the team for 3-5 years , then sell shares in a public offering . <p> " Baseball is not a sport , it is a family culture , " Pohlad says . " Baseball has to start finding new ways for ownership . A broad ownership will result in more attendance . " <p> Pohlad 's plan to divest himself of the team is similar to the ownership situation with the Kansas City Royals . When Royals owner Ewing Kauffman died in 1993 , he gave his stock in the team to the Greater Kansas City Community Foundation . The difference : Kauffman 's plan did n't have a stadium bill attached to it . <p> Whatever happens , experts say that baseball 's spiraling player salaries and general financial concerns will make it difficult for teams to make money in the future . <p> Mark Rosentraub , a professor at Indiana University and a critic of publicly financed stadiums , told Minnesota lawmakers the plan they will vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And Marc Ganis , president of Sportscorps , a Chicago-based sports facilities consulting firm , says stadiums are getting tough to build with public money because rising player salaries offend taxpayers . <p> That happened in Minnesota after Kevin Garnett signed a six-year , $ 126 million contract with the NBA Timberwolves on Sept. 30 . It created a storm of controversy , with fans saying it did n't seem to make sense for team owners to pay big salaries while asking for help to build stadiums . <p> " I think the Garnett contract overwhelmed everyone , " says Judy Blaseg , a political fund-raiser in Minneapolis . <p> Garnett says he did not intend to become part of the stadium politics : " I do n't know what the public is saying . I know that I 'm a sports fan and would like the Twins to stay . " <p> Making a change <p> After going nowhere with his previous stadium financing plan , which did not include turning over the team to a charitiable foundation , Pohlad came up with the proposal calling for eventual communityownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gov . Carlson , lawmakers and former Twins Bert Blyleven and Puckett have blitzed the state in a campaign-style rush to get support for the new plan . <p> The Twins ' problems go back to the media 's portrayal of Pohlad , a billionaire , making demands on the state , says Edward Schiappa , a professor of communications at the University of Minnesota . " And as any Garrison Keilor sketch will tell you , people do n't take kindly to that , " Schiappa says . <p> But when the focus moved from Pohlad as an individual to a campaign to save the Twins , people started changing their minds . " The Twins are beloved , " Schiappa says . <p> The new approach has changed the minds of some lawmakers , but not everyone . <p> " If it smells like a subsidy and looks like a subsidy and if taxpayer money is used , then it is a subsidy , " says Rep. Kevin Kennedy , a Republican businessman from Bloomington . <p> But Phil Carruthers , a Democrat from Brooklyn Center and speaker of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he says the stadium issue is going to pass . <p> Whether it does or not , taxpayer issues might not be finished . Sports teams in Minnesota are lining up for help from the government . The state of the Minnesota , already paying $ 765,000 annually for 30 years to the Target Center , home of the Timberwolves , is hearing requests for stadiums from the NFL Vikings , who share the 15-year-old Metrodome with the Twins , and the NHL expansion team that will play in St. Paul beginning in 2000 . <p> Minneapolis-St . Paul is the 15th-largest market in population , but Ganis says it will have a tough time supporting four pro sports teams , especially with the Minnesota Gophers in the same area with basketball , football and hockey . <p> Says Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor : " It puts tremendous pressure on you to have a winning team . If you go into a cycle of not winning , it can be difficult . " <p> The Twins did n't win last season . But neither side of the Minnesota stadium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we approve , it does n't set good precedent , " Sviggum says . " If we do it for the entertainment business , what do we tell the farmer or the businessman that comes next ? " <p> Twins President Jerry Bell has an answer : " Tell them they pay nothing , if they do n't go to any baseball games . They can keep baseball and watch it on TV .
