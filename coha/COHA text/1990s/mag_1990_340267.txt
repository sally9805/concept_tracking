People are losing their confidence in perestroika , considering it for the most part to be rhetoric . Many have lost their faith in Mikhail Gorbachev . But the biggest trouble in our house has come from the least expected place : our rich family of nationalities . <P> Our misfortune is being played out on two fronts : the flare-ups of ethnic $ hatred within the republics and the growing opposition of the republics themselves to Moscow . These calamities have been as unexpected to us as the disintegration of the world colonial system was to many Marxists . We had rejoiced at the crumbling of that system . At the same time , we believed our empire was protected from such troubles ; after all , did n't we enjoy an immunity of sorts in our " eternal brotherhood of peoples " ? <P> Such slogans have not helped . An enormous fire of national strife burns in the U.S.S.R. <P> The embarrassed initiators of perestroika are still unable to define this problem and rely instead on such terms as nationalism , conflict and separatism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate words , for we are witnessing the crash of the last world empire , coupled with the downfall of what was most Stalinist in the Stalinist system . <P> To understand today 's events , we must go back to the beginning . It is December 1922 , and Lenin has just retired into his final illness . But his mind is still pulsing . On Dec. 30 the First Congress of Soviets of the U.S.S.R. is scheduled to devise a structure for the union . Joseph Stalin is pushing for national groups to join the Russian Federation as autonomous republics . But Lenin wants all the regions , including Russia , to sign a treaty of equality and form a union . His view will ultimately prevail . <P> But Lenin immediately begins to have second thoughts . Perhaps the union will still have too much power over the republics . He dictates a letter  --  one can only call it apocalyptic  --  in which he laments that he has " failed the Russian workers for not interfering strongly enough in the so-called issue of autonomy . " Lenin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan once more so that the union would retain only its diplomatic and military functions . <P> All the participants in the birth of the U.S.S.R. believed they were choosing the best method of solving the nationalities question . Instead , they were setting a huge time bomb . No matter what the reasons were behind the formulation of the union  --  according to Lenin , to stimulate the world revolution ; according to Stalin , to build socialism in one country  --  it would even out the various levels of development of many peoples and bring different nations , cultures and civilizations into a common framework . But only one method could be used to achieve this Utopian goal : mass violence . The union was doomed from the very beginning . <P> ! Thus , at the very moment the U.S.S.R. was being formed , Lenin was aware of its explosive nature . He realized that if his original proposal was formally implemented without guaranteeing the rights of republics , the union would eventually be transformed into a notorious ruler of the center over the republics , overseen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrant , which is what a typical Russian bureaucrat is . " After Lenin died in 1924 , his worst fears became a reality under Stalin .
