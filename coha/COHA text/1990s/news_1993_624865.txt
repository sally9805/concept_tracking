<p> WASHINGTON  --  Whenever a tyrant  --  or a tyrannical majority  --  tramples on the rights and lives of a people at home , the world outside rarely does more than grit its teeth and cry foul . <p> The sacred principle of sovereignty stands in the way . <p> No one has the right , according to a sheaf of international documents , to cross borders and interfere in the internal affairs of another country . <p> Yet the world 's mood is changing , the principle is eroding . <p> France 's Bernard Kouchner , the flamboyant former health minister who led President Francois Mitterrand to Sarajevo last year and helped carry rice ashore in Somalia , offers an astounding prediction : <p> He envisions a global , standing U.N . Human Rights Army in 20 years . Filled with idealistic , well-meaning young recruits , this army , on orders from the United Nations , would march across borders to stand between antagonistic peoples and thus prevent the eruption of ethnic civil war . <p> " " It can happen , " he insisted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists would be satisfied with more mundane steps to help people oppressed by leaders or by a country 's dominant ethnic group . They would like to see the appointment of a U.N . high commissioner for human rights and a ringing endorsement of the thesis that the world as a whole is diminished when anyone tramples on human rights within his or her borders . <p> Hopes for these steps could be buoyed  --  or dashed  --  by the impending U.N . World Conference on Human Rights , the first such gathering in a quarter of a century . <p> The 12-day conference , opening in Vienna on Monday , comes at a time when the world has been dispirited by a New Tribalism  --  an outbreak of ethnic hatred particularly among peoples in Eastern Europe whose rage at one another was suppressed by decades of communism . <p> This outburst of hate and cruelty is much like the Old Tribalism that came to the fore in independent Africa after decades of a colonialism that suppressed longstanding ethnic hatreds . But Eastern Europe and tropical Africa are not the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persecute Christian Copts . The Indonesians still oppress East Timor . The list is long and woeful . <p> In fact , according to a major U.N.report released late last month , whether because of discrimination or other factors , " " almost every country has one or more ethnic groups whose level of human development falls far below the national average . " <p> Outrage over recent outbursts of particularly pointed ethnic violence in the post-Cold War world has led to some erosion of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of a country . <p> Foreign troops and air power have protected the Kurds in northern Iraq . The United States and four European governments have proposed sending U.N . troops to half a dozen Bosnian towns to protect Muslim civilians against Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat aggression . The Clinton administration Friday said that 300 U.S. troops would be dispatched to Macedonia as a deterrent against any attempt by the Serbian government to suppress the Albanian people who live inside the Serbian province of Kosovo . U.S. and U.N . troops did not ask for any official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that situations such as Somalia and Iraq are special cases . But Sadako Ogata of Japan , the U.N.high commissioner for refugees , dismisses that analysis as too glib . <p> " " When there are so many special cases , I begin to wonder , " she says . " " There definitely has been an erosion of sovereignty . " <p> Some human rights specialists believe that the international community of nations may be closer than ever to embracing the principle that violations of human rights are everyone 's business  --  that there is no moral justification for closed borders serving as a sanctuary for those who abuse rights and peoples . <p> Many human rights activists look toward the United Nations as a potential force for breaking borders to guarantee human rights . <p> Yet the sovereignty of nations has no greater champion than the United Nations . <p> Only a couple of weeks ago , Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , who will inaugurate the Vienna conference , banned Chinese dissident Shen Tong , one of the organizers of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square , from holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sponsorship of the U.N . Correspondents Association . <p> Boutros-Ghali acted after the Chinese ambassador complained that the United Nations was abetting a propaganda attack on his country . Despite pleas from reporters that the United Nations had for decades allowed dissidents from many countries to hold news conferences at its headquarters , Boutros-Ghali refused to rescind his ban . Reporters met with Shen Tong on the sidewalk outside the visitors entrance to the General Assembly . Freedom of speech had been overpowered by state sovereignty at the United Nations . <p> Other signs from the United Nations are just as frustrating . <p> Meeting in Thailand in April , diplomats from 40 Asian and Pacific countries issued the " " Declaration of Bangkok , " which set down their human rights position for the Vienna conference . The declaration contended that different civilizations treat human rights in different ways ; waved the hoary principles of sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs ; and denounced any attempt by rich countries to cut foreign aid because of human rights violations . <p> The Declaration of Bangkok , in fact , sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the resounding but non-enforceable pronouncement on the universality of human rights that the U.N.General Assembly adopted in 1948 . <p> The signs from Africa are just as frustrating . At their preparatory meeting in Tunis , the capital of Tunisia , last November , African delegates declared that " " no ready-made model ( of human rights ) can be prescribed at the universal level " because of the different histories , cultural realities , traditions , standards and values of each nation . <p> The Clinton administration wants the conference to recommend the creation of a new U.N . high commissioner for human rights with the prestige and authority both to call the world 's attention to violations of human rights and to pressure governments to allow U.N . officials entry to deal with the problem . <p> The model would be the U.N . high commissioner for refugees , who has the resources and authority to spotlight and handle refugee problems throughout the world . But Ogata , who has filled the refugee post for more than two years , said that national sovereignty is a substantial obstacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to enter a country and care for its internal refugees . Refugees come under U.N . protection only after they flee their homelands . Ogata has managed to do some work with refugees within Sri Lanka and is considering a request from Peru that she deal with internal refugees there . But , by and large , she is kept out of the internal affairs of countries . <p> " " I do n't see how a human rights commissioner can move into a state situation , " she told a Times reporter at the residence of the Japanese ambassador in Washington . <p> Support for a U.N . high commissioner for human rights is tepid at best within Asia and Africa , and many analysts now doubt that the Vienna conference will adopt the proposal . <p> The grim plight of southern Sudan underscores the pernicious strength of sovereignty . Many observers insist that the starvation and horror of Sudan is far worse than that of Somalia . But the world has not discovered Sudan , mainly because television cameras have not yet entered in force . <p> Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ravaged by intermittent civil war as the Christian and animist black Africans of the south chafe under the domination of the Muslim Arab-influenced Sudanese of the north . <p> According to a recent State Department report , Arab militias , with the connivance of the Sudanese government , are guilty of massacres , kidnapping , rape , slavery and forced Islamization in the south . Although the Sudanese government , under pressure , agreed to allow outside agencies to supply relief in 1991 , almost all was suspended after Sudanese soldiers killed aid workers . U.N . officials insist that they would like to alleviate the starvation and care for refugees but that they feel helpless in the face of Sudanese government hostility . " " We would like to be involved in the Sudan , " says a U.N . undersecretary general . " " But where 's the hook ? " <p> As in Bosnia-Herzegovina , it is not always wise to put all the blame on one side . The southern Sudanese rebels are divided into two feuding factions , and their raids on each other have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two factions signed an agreement creating four demilitarized havens in the south and invited the United Nations to ship in supplies of food . Although the agreement was hailed by the State Department , it is too soon to tell how it will work in practice . <p> Meanwhile , the attention of human rights activists has turned to Vienna , where 5,000 delegates from more than 180 nations are assembling for the World Conference on Human Rights . Several thousand observers will be coming from private organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch as well . Unlike at the enormous Earth Summit that attracted world leaders to Rio de Janeiro a year ago , few statesmen are expected to attend . Neither the history nor the vibes are uspicious . <p> The only previous World Conference on Human Rights was held in Tehran , Iran , in 1968 , the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Its opening moment reeked with hypocrisy : The delegates were welcomed by the Shah of Iran , who presided over one of the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a condemnation of Nazism , a plea for non-discriminatory hiring and some other milquetoast and obvious resolutions . <p> The delegates are likely to be more forthright this time . But many human rights activists fear that the poorer nations of the world will downgrade the basic issue of human rights abuses and turn the conference into an affirmation of their right to economic development . Poverty , they are likely to insist , is an abuse of human rights like all others . <p> " " I 'm worried about the conference , " says Karsten Luethke , chairman of Amnesty International in Germany . " " It 's almost certain nothing is going to come out of it . " <p> Yet the conference will convene at a time of more awareness of the issue than ever before and at a time of such sophisticated means of worldwide communication that abuses are harder to hide than ever before . In the first months of 1993 , the Center for Human Rights , the Geneva-based agency that monitors abuses for the United Nations , has received more than 125,000 complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complaints that were filed in all of last year . <p> France 's Kouchner intends to base his U.N . Human Rights Army solidly on international law . He hails the Security Council resolution that protected the Kurds in Iraq after the Persian Gulf war . Until then , he says , " " international law was so old-fashioned that it was OK to protect oil , but not a persecuted minority . " <p> Kouchner estimates that it would take five years to lay the legal groundwork for his army and to persuade Third World countries that intervention is in their interest . <p> " " Of course , this will take time , " he says . " " But we need a major world debate on this issue . We have to make ( Third World countries ) realize this is for their people too . Such an idea can only work if it comes from the Third World too . For that , you have to sit down and speak with them frankly , as equals , not like arrogant conquistadores . " <p> " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But politicians must accept their responsibility . Otherwise , we 'll all be blown up in one war after another . "
