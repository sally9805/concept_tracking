Skyler and Julia crept to the basement door of the Big House and looked around to make sure they were n't being watched . A breeze stirred the humid air , rustling the Spanish moss that hung from the old oaks that arched over what used to be the approach road . It made a dry , whispering sound . It was dusk , at least , which meant they would be hard to spot in the shadows of the old manorbut not that hard if someone walked around back . Skyler felt the fear as a tingling in his groin ; from there it spread upward to his belly and reached his arms and legs . This is crazy , he thought . If they were caughthe could n't even imagine the punishment . Nothing like this had ever happened at the Lab . They were n't sure what they were going to do . They had no plan , really , other than to break into the Records Room and search for clues to explain what had happened to Patrick . They had to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his disappearance would never be known . It would remain forever mysterious , like those of the others on the island , who had been taken away and never returned . That morning Patrick had appeared fine . He had eaten breakfast with the others in the Age Group and then gone off to calisthenics and chores . But by the early afternoon they had heard the rumors : he had been summoned for a physicalnot the routine weekly examination but a special physical . That was a signal that something was wrong , that perhaps a dreadful illness had beendiscovered , and sure enough , the Elder Physicians had convened a meeting before dinner to inform them that Patrick had been " called away . " The phrase had been uttered ambivalently , as it always was : in sadness certainly , for the Physicians had loved him as they loved them all , but also with a hint of reverenceas if he had made some sort of noble sacrifice . At the doorway Skyler moved closer to Julia . He smelled the familiar scent of her hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorknob and turned it slowly , and pushed . Nothing happened . He held the knob firmly , lifting it while he rocked the door gently with his other hand , and it suddenly gave way . So , it was not locked . That made sense : the leaders of the Lab would not have worried about security . Who , after all , would be foolish enough to open it ? He slipped inside and heard her light tread behind him . She was breathing in long spurts . When he closed the door , darkness engulfed them . Above their heads , they could hear footsteps creaking along the old floorboards and the indistinct murmur of voices . Skyler listened ; he could n't identify them . One was high-pitched and sounded a bit like Baptiste when he was excited or angry . Skyler felt a rush of complicated emotions and a strange sense of longing . What would happen if they just marched upstairs and demanded to know everything ? He darted a quick glance outside . The wind was up and the moss was waving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island . What are we looking for ? Julia had already moved across the room . He hurried to a bank of filing cabinets and began tugging at a drawer , but it would not open . He saw that it was locked in place by an iron bar that ran across the front , secured by a padlock on one side . He looked at her quizzically . She knew this place , the Records Room , from her afternoon career chore . She would come in to dust and straighten up , although of course she was not permitted to touch the machines or files or even any of the thick textbooks that lined the shelves . But while refilling printers and stacking paper and washing the floors , she had observed a lot . She had made a game of carefully watching the computer operators , and once , left alone , she had even tried to work the machine . Before Skyler knew it , she was seated at the computer . She clicked it on , and instantly a greenish glow filled the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off her shirtwhat is she doing ? and then Skyler understood as she draped it over the screen and poked her head under it . The glow shrank within her little tent , and it shivered with her movements . Skyler moved away and stood guard , his back to a wall . His eyes were now accustomed to the dark , and he scanned the room . The interior walls were hewn from rock and whitewashed , the exterior ones constructed with cinder blocks . The floor was linoleum , and the ceiling was covered in acoustical tiles marked in one corner with a widening pool of brown water stains . There was not much furniture : the computer Julia was sitting at and one other on a plain wooden desk , metal file cabinets , a bookshelf , a standing lamp and a green Naugahyde chair with a rip down one arm . He looked at Julia , who seemed oddly at ease now that she had something to do , and he admired her coolness . He had never before set foot in the Records Room , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the windows for movement outside , but he knew that the real danger was closer at handthe staircase . If they were discovered , it would most likely happen because one of those voices above decided to come downstairs . What if an Orderly needed to fetch something ? He tried to push the thought away . Julia 's head was still hidden ; he could almost hear her thinking as she pecked at the keys , trying different combinations . Then she removed the blouse from the screen and looked at him , a ghostly radiation upon her cheeks . " Sky , come , " she whispered . He raced over and peered across her bared shoulder at a blank screen . " I ca n't get anything , " she said , distraught . " I do n't know how to work this thing . It 's hopeless . " She turned the machine off , and the green glow shrank to a dot and disappeared . She stood and put on her shirt . Skyler glanced outside one last time and approached the only other door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he knew he would have to open it . He suspected that it led to a place about which he had heard rumors for as long as he could remember . As children , it had loomed large in the dark corners of their fearful fantasies . He turned the brass doorknob and pulled . There was a white metal table in the center , and domed lights above , shining brightly . The floor was graded slightly and led to a drain . Cabinets lined the walls , stocked with medical equipment . Tanks of gas with rubber tubing and a mask stood next to a bed in one corner . The room was scrubbed more painstakingly than any he had ever seen . Slowly , he stepped inside , and Julia came behind . The room was warm and stuffy . There was yet another door , thick and heavy like the vault of a meat locker . He crossed the floor and pushed the door lever , and it moved swiftly inward , opening onto a black void . He found a switch and flipped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he focused upon the terrible sight before him . For there , stretched out upon a slab , was a body . At first it looked like a small statue , pale and strangely shrunken . It was lying upon its back . The feet lay pointing outward , as in repose . There was a yellowish-green hue under the neck and spreading in half circles around the armpits . Male genitals slumped to one side , swollen with fluid . Skyler tried to avoid looking at the chest , but found his eyes drawn inexorably to it . The chest was gone . In its place was a cavity , sliced open , neat as a gutted fish . Flaps of squared-off skin hung down on either side like shutters on a window , and the rib cage had collapsed inward around a dark hole that was ringed in dark reddried blood . It was Patrick . Skyler jumped as Julia slipped up behind him and touched him lightly on the arm . He felt her stiffen as she saw the body , and he heard her next to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he exclaimed in a voice gone small . " His heart 's gone . " He heard her resume breathing . They stared for some seconds . " But why ? " she said . He had no answer . They backed out and turned off the light and closed the vault . In the Records Room , Skyler stood watch while Julia examined the desk and computer with trembling hands , making sure there were no traces of their presence . When they got outside and shut the door behind them , they looked around quickly to make sure the coast was clear . They ran as fast as they could and did n't stop until they were deep inside the now darkening woods . Even there , the only sanctuary on the island left to them , Skyler and Julia no longer felt safe . They stopped , gasping for breath . She sat on the ground , and he leaned against a tree . When she spoke , her voice was so low that he could also hear the stirrings of small animals in the underbrush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . " I do n't understand , " she said . " Why did they have to take everything out of him ? What did he have ? " " I do n't know , but it must have been deadly . Fast-acting and deadly . " " How do we know ? " " Why else would they cut him up like that ? " " Do you think it was some horrible disease ? " " Maybe that 's what they 're trying to find out . " " Do you think it 's contagious ? Maybe we got it . " " We were only there a couple of seconds " " His heart was missingyou saw that . Where was it ? Why would they take it out ? " " I do n't knowunless , maybe , they 're analyzing it or something . " His tone did n't sound convincing , he realized , when he heard himself . " I do n't know , " she said , standing up and walking around . " I hate thisit 's frightening . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " Skyler knew what that meant , where she was headed . For months her doubts and suspicions had been growing , faster even than his . And when they got together for their secret meetings , which seemed to both of them more and more risky , sooner or later she broached the subject . She was becoming obsessive . " Patrick 's not the first to die " Skyler noted that she did not mention Raisin by name , and he was at least grateful for that " and he 's not the first to be called in for a special physical . Why do n't they ever discover something during the regular physical ? " " I do n't know . Sometimes they do . " " But not always . And that makes it seem like they know something 's wrong beforehanddo n't you see ? " He did . And as so often happened , he knew without knowing ; on some level he had had the same thought , but he had n't cared to examine it until she held it right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind was swift , unrelenting . She could brave things that he preferred to look away from . He nodded and glanced at her in the fading quarter-light , her long dark hair hanging in strands against her cheek , the paleness of her underarms as she reached out . " It 's horrible , " she said . " Just horrible . " She put her arms around his back , and they held each other tightly . They had done that hundreds of times , but still , at the first touch , there was always that flashthe forbidden . The Lab did not allow boys and girls to mingle , and now that they were older , the prohibition was backed by a punishment so severe that no one even knew what it would be . No one had ever violated the rule . Until them . He realized , as he began to calm a little , that he had been trembling since he had seen the body . " We have to go back " she said , pulling back at arm 's length and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dorms . What if somebody comes ? " Skyler knew she was rightwhat they were doing was dangerousbut he did not want to let her go . He was reluctant to be alone with his thoughts . They held hands as long as they dared , until they reached the outskirts of the Campus . Then they separated and moved toward their separate barracks , passing the Big House in the distance . A full moon was on the rise , and Skyler could see the mansion through the shadows of the oak trees that surrounded it . The moss hanging from the branches obscured part of the facade , but the moonlight reflected off the upper windows like a glow from within . At one point , Skyler looked back and saw Julia slipping from behind a tree to the pedestal of a statue of a Greek goddess , and as the moonlight caught her , it froze her in his mind forever , so graceful and vulnerable . In bed , lying upon the thin mattress that covered his wooden bunk , Skyler listened to the sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had heard his entire life , and tried not to think about Patrick . He almost thought the sounds were a little altered , that he could detect one missing . There would be , he knew , a funeral service , and Baptiste would speak , as he had at the other services . Skyler did n't want to think about those either . Instead he tried thinking about the past , when he 'd been young and everything had been different . The island had been his universe to explore . How he had loved the scientific excursions into the forest , the mad search for bugs and plants . How happy he had been on those occasionslike Baptiste 's birthdaywhen the doors of the Big House were thrown open to them . How he used to relish those nights sleeping out of doors to learn about the stars , scanning the skies with telescopes ; in the mornings he would awaken early and lie still , identifying the birds by their calls and watching the first thin rays of the sun shimmer over the water . Jimminies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from or what it signified , they were never told . They were all about the same age , a year or two different , no more . So they were especially close . Growing up in the Lab , they had felt secure and content . Neither Skyler nor any of the others had ever really questioned not having parents , even though they knew that children on the mainland " the other side , " it was calledpossessed them , In reality , all the Elder Physicians were their parents , they were told , and they were lucky to have " not two , but twenty " figures of respect who raised the children according to scientific principles and treated them all with an equal hand . And , anyway , Skyler and the other Jimminies were special . They were " pioneers of science , " participants in a noble experiment . On their island paradise , they would live long and fruitful lives through a regime of mental purity and bodily health . If they were lucky , they would never experience " the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would never get any closer to it than the movies and TV programs they were allowed to watch on special occasions . But it did n't always feel like paradise : the endless medical examinations , the pills and vaccinations , the blood and urine samples , the calisthenics and rules against running games that might be harmful . And then , too , there were the Orderlies , three of them , so much alike and each with that peculiar slash of white in his hair , who ruled over them like stern older brothers . It was hard not to dislike them . Skyler had a distinct recollection of the time long agomore than ten years nowwhen he 'd first become restless . He 'd been fourteen years old at the time . Like so many of his memories , this one was bound up with his best friend , Johnny Ray , or Raisin , as Skyler himself had named him . It had begun to happen on a summer day after the science lesson in the lecture hall , a one-room wooden structure set high on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , the hot , thick air barely moved . Above the blackboard was a customized couplet , printed in handsome script : Nature and Nature 's laws lay hid in night : Bacon said , " Let Newton be ! " and all was light . In unison they had recited Rincon 's First Law , named after the Lab 's founder , Dr. Rincon , who did not live on the island and was known to them only through his teachings and his research : " Human life alone is sacred ; its preservation and extension is our mission . " Scientific facts were drummed into them , learned by incantations and memorization . They learned the periodic table of elements , the name of every part of the body , the biological kingdoms and phyla , all the known planets of all the known solar systems , even the four-letter coded DNA sequences surrounding a hundred and twenty disease genes . On this particular day they received back papers they had written , most with high marks . Outside the lecture hall , Raisin pulled Skyler aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What is ? " " Writing papers , getting grades . They do n't even read them . " " How do you know ? " " I tested them . After the first two paragraphs I made it up . I wrote complete gibberish . " He showed his paper and the grade he had gotten , scrawled at the end : VERY GOOD . " I do n't think they care whether we learn or notyou ever get that feeling ? " In fact , Skyler realized , he did have that feeling sometimes , but he had never put it into words . " But then why would they teach us ? " Raisin shrugged . " I do n't know . Maybe to keep us busy . " For days afterward , Raisin kept up a tirade . He harped on the restrictions that circumscribed their lives : the books in the library that they could not read because they were " not fit , " TV shows that they saw advertised but were not permitted to watch , games of roughhouse they could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot afternoon , through the open windows , they heard , as they sometimes did , distant cries carried by the windthe sounds of younger children at play at the Nursery . The Nursery was a small adjacent islandit could be reached across a narrow sandbar at low tidebut the Jimminies were not allowed to go there . Nor were the toddlers ever brought onto the mainland . " Did you ever wonder , " Raisin asked later , " why we never see them ? What would be the harm in it ? " There was another group with whom the Jimminies were permitted no contactthe Gullah , a tiny community of black people . Skyler and Raisin had heardfrom where they did not remember that these were descendants of slaves , and that many years ago scores of them had inhabited the southern half of the island . Now there were only a dozen or so , mostly fishermen living in shacks on the western shore . A few brought fish to the Big House , and they were objects of fascination to the Jimminies , mysterious silent beings who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on long fronds ripped from the fan-shaped palmettos . " They have boats , " said Raisin . " Why do n't we have any boats ? Why is the only boat in the Lab locked up inside the boathouse ? " Skyler finally turned on Raisin , demanding that he stop posing his stupid , troublesome questions . " Why are you doing this ? " he shouted . Raisin smiled . " Asking questions is supposed to be part of science , " he replied . " It 's called the scientific method . Remember ? " And then gradually a strange thing happened : Skyler began asking questions , tooto himselflittle ones first and then bigger ones . One Sunday morning , he gazed up at Baptiste during Dogma and had a remarkable sensation . Not so very long ago he had been enthralled by Dogma . The services had given structure to his week , in the same way that science gave meaning to his life . Even before he understood the full meanings of the words , he loved to hear Baptiste roll them out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gripping the lectern with both hands , he was practically yelling . Skyler would sit there spellbound . But this day he felt nothing . He looked at the symbol upon the wall , the twin-headed snake coiled around a staff . He looked at the blown-up photograph of Dr. Rincon in his white coat , gazing off confidently as if he were surveying a future in which Reason and Science had triumphed . And he looked at Baptiste , whose coal black hair was pulled tightly around his head , accentuating a skull that seemed as narrow as an ax blade . And he felt nothing . The Chief Elder Physician spoke . He spoke about the " beauty of reason and organization over the chaos of superstition and religion . " What did he mean ? He spoke about " the pendulum of the historical-cultural cycle swinging to our side . " The words sounded hollow . It used to make Skyler feel privileged , all this talk of how they were so special , raised by the Lab as acolytes of science . A chosen tribe stronger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from " the other side " to avoid contamination from the " modern-day Babylon " of the United States . But now he did n't know what to feelhe did n't feel much of anything . How strange it was . Baptiste kept speaking , but Skyler blocked out the words . He stared at this man who had been the magnetic force at the center of his life for as long as he could remember . And it was then that the remarkable sensation happened : slowly , as he looked , Baptiste began to appear smaller , frail , aging with specks of gray in his hair and crow 's feet around his eyes . He even seemedwas it possible ? slightly ludicrous . Skyler leaned forward and turned slightly to catch a glimpse of Raisin . He could tell by his posture , hunched in on himself as if in concealment , that he was undergoing the same epiphany . They locked eyes , and Skyler saw an ember of defiance burning there . At that moment the two exchanged an unspoken , unspeakable secretapostasy. * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions would n't go away . Odd things kept happening . A girl named Jenny disappeared into the surgical ward for six days , and when she returned , they were told her left eye had been diseased ; in its place she wore one made of glass . A boy was taken away in the middle of the day , held in the ward for two days , and then just as mysteriously releasedthe attending physician said his illness had been successfully treated . Raisin , tall and gangly with his hair sticking out in all directions like animal fur , was turning strange . He had always been different . For one thing , he was an epileptic , subject to sudden fainting spells . Though it was never stated outright , both he and Skyler knew that the illness was troubling to the Elder Physiciansanything less than perfect health was deemed a failure . For another , Raisin had stopped taking the daily pill handed out to all the Jimminies at evening meal . He insisted the pill robbed him of energy . Proudly , he showed Skyler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed ; saving it for a collection stashed in a tin can under his bed . Wherever he went , he secretly carried a child 's toy , a wooden soldier four inches tall , so bruised and knocked about that its blue and red paint was largely gone ; even when they went on forced marches around the Campus , he kept it in his pocket , and sometimes at night when the others were sleeping , he would take it out and play with it and show it only to Skyler . Increasingly , Raisin was on the verge of open rebellion . He had become a target of attack at the Lab 's Self-Criticism sessions . He was denounced by the Orderlies for various offenses and spent hours with the Psychologist Physician . Three times he was punished for disobedience , forced to spend the night hungry and alone locked inside " the Box , " an old chicken shed at the edge of forty-foot pines ; the sounds of the animals foraging in the darkness around him frightened him , and in the morning he was welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For days afterward he behaved himself , but it did n't last . The only saving grace was that Skyler and Raisin and many of the other Jimminies had turned fifteen , and so their schooling stopped and instead they took on chores . Skyler was a goatherd . Every morning he rounded up a band of the scrawny animals from the barnyard , shepherded them to distant pastures and brought them back in the late afternoon when the sun was low in the Sky . This brought him a taste of freedom . Raisin was given the worst chores , but one of them had a hidden blessing . Once a week he was sent to collect honey from beehives in the woodsa job few others were brave enough to doand these turned into occasions for celebration . He would abandon his honey jars and meet up with Skyler . Away from the Lab together , they could do whatever they wanted . Sometimes when the two of them were alone in the woods , Raisin would have a seizure , and Skyler learned to care for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hold a stick in his mouth so that he would n't swallow his tongue . Afterward , Skyler would cradle his head and murmur gentle phrases to him as he came back to consciousness , surfacing from some dark depths , blank-minded and confused . They , of course , kept the fits a secret . Way up in the northern forest , Skyler discovered a hidden meadow reached through a narrow passage in a ravine . It was hemmed in with boulders and trees , and , ringing it around with branches and underbrush , he turned it into a makeshift corral for the goats . By confining them inside , he was able to roam free . From then on , when he met with Raisin , their horizons expanded . For a few watchful hours at a time , they had the run of the wild area to the north . They explored the swamps and dense woods , running along the paths made by wild boar and deer . They gamboled in the fields and climbed trees so tall that they could see the whitecaps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that much more delicious . On one particular spring day , when the outlying blanket of cordgrass waved in the ocean breeze and the loblolly pine smelled fresh of sap , something extraordinary happened to them . With the goats securely tucked away in their enclosure and the honey jars already full , they were lying upon their backs in a field , when Raisin , a piece of straw sticking from his mouth like a cigarette , turned to Skyler and suddenly announced that he wanted to explore the western shore . " But that 's where the Gullah are , " protested Skyler . " That 's the whole damn point , " he replied , using the one profane word he had picked up from TV . And before Skyler could think of an objection , Raisin was on his feet , off and running . Skyler kept up and followed , but he was at pains to keep up , running as fast as he could . They tore along a path toward the shore and then through a patch of swampland , sending the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw his back receding ahead of him , zigzagging between the trees until he disappeared altogether . Then suddenly Skyler heard a sharp cry , followed by a long moan . He recognized it instantlythe onset of a seizure . By the time he caught up , Raisin was writhing on his back , his limbs jerking in spasms and his eyes turned up in the sockets . Quickly , Skyler covered him with his own body and placed a stick between his teeth : He thrust his head to one side and held on with all his might , trying to deaden his weight to keep Raisin close to the ground , riding out the seizure like a wrestler pinning an opponent . Gradually , he felt the spasms subside and the body beneath him turn limp . But as he rolled off , something lashed his arm , thin and strong as a whip . For an instant , he imagined Raisin had sprouted a tail . Then he saw what it was , and as he leapt up and turned the body to one side , the snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Raisin 's leg . He got a branch and beat it until finally it released its hold and curled up . He smashed the head until it stopped moving and then ran back to Raisin . " Do n't move him , child ! " The command came over his left shoulder . He obeyed it instantly without even thinking about it . He was pushed aside , and a pair of coal black hands ripped Raisin 's pants open , exposing a red welt and two tiny black-blue holes in the milky flesh . A knife came out , moving quickly to make four slits in a crosshatch . The elderly man with gray hair bent down , pursing his lips and sucking the wound with a slurping sound . He turned and spat out venom and sucked some more , and soon he was extracting mouthfuls of blood and expelling them upon the leaves of a berry bush . Raisin began to stir . " Hold him still , " the man directed , and Skyler did as he was told . The old man made deeper cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the ground . " Do n't pay to take no chances , " he said . " That 'd be no ordinary snake . That 's a water moccasin . Soon , Raisin was awake , and Skyler was ordered to carry him . He did , and followed the large elderly man , who was dressed in a bulky blue sweatshirt and wide-bottomed blue pants . They went down the path until finally they came to a clearing and he could smell the mudflats . Ahead was a grove of cypress , and on the other side , a shack no bigger than a garage , made of shingles painted blue . As he carried Raisin inside , he looked to his left and saw an expanse of water coming right up to the grassy bank . There was an old wooden dock , and tied to itSkyler 's heart skipped a beat when he saw itwas a boat with an outboard motor . " Put him down " the man said , gesturing to a sagging iron-frame bed covered with a quilt . Skyler was dying to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , with so many new and intriguing objectsbut he kept silent as the old man bound up Skyler 's wound and even sewed together his pants leg . " No reason to go around talkin ' about this , " he said . " Those people you live with , they do n't take to your talkin ' to strangers . You go tellin ' anyone , and you 're going to have to deal with meand I got my ways . " The man cast a hard glance at Skyler , who was sitting quietly in an overstuffed easy chair , and at that point the boy suddenly recognized himone of the fishermen who brought their catch to the kitchen window of the Big House . " We wo n't , I promise , " he said . " Damned rightwe wo n't . " Raisin suddenly sat up in the bed , surprising both of them . The old man took Skyler over to a window and pointed at the backyard , a jumble of long weeds and engine parts . To the rear was a tupelo maple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , shiny objectshubcaps , Skyler later realized . They turned , glistening in the sunlight . " I have my ways , " said the old man . " You ever heard of juju ? " Skyler shook his head . " Magic . You talk about this and it 'll be the last talkin ' you do . You 'll just open your mouth and nothin ' will come out . " Raisin , intrigued , asked his name . " I do n't go tellin ' my name till I know the other ' ns . " They introduced themselves , awkwardly . They had never done that before . " I 'm Kuta . " " How come you 're called that ? " asked Raisin . " How come you 're called Raisin ? " " I do n't know . It 's just a nickname . " " Mine 's more than a nickname . It 's a story . " And the old man settled into the easy chair . Skyler sat next to Raisin on the bed . " Kuta 's Gullah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know nothing about that . It means turtle . I 'm called that , ' cause when I was born , I was such a little thing , the midwife held me up in the palm of her hand , lying on my back , and I was so small they did n't expect me to live . She says : Why , this little babe 's no bigger than a turtle . ' And so I was . But I kicked my legs and I kept on kicking and I just willed myself to keep on living . Even when I was growed , the name stuck . " " And what 's that ? " asked Raisin , pointing at a trumpet hanging from the wall by a peg . Skyler knew Raisin knew the answer ; they had seen bands playing on television . " That , " said Kuta proudly . " That 's my instrument . " He fixed Raisin with a stare . " You usually ask so many questionsor is that the snake talking ? " But he did n't wait for an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing the trumpet in jazz bands on the mainland . He talked about juke joints in New Orleans and life on the road , playing for ten bucks a night and gambling it away and waking up next to beautiful women whose names he could not recall . " Nothing like the travelin ' life , " he declared , rubbing a gray beard that stood out against his black leathery chin . " Broadening to the spirit . Good for the soul . A man needs travelin ' the way a fish needs the ocean . " And as he talked , Skyler looked at Raisin and could see that he , too , was entranced . They stayed , that first day , more than an hour . Kuta saw them off , standing on his doorstep , leaning his bulk against the frame , while Raisin asked one final questioncould they come again to visit ? Kuta pawed his cheek , thinking . " You know you ai n't supposed to be ' round here . " Silence again . Finally , the old man looked them over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's no harm , so long as you do n't go tellin ' nobody . Specially those Orderlies . I do n't want no trouble , now . " When they returned to the Lab , Raisin limping on one leg and Skyler trying to shoulder his weight , they talked excitedly . Skyler had n't seen Raisin like this in years . It seemed a whole new world had opened up , and their minds were suddenly reeling with new possibilities . " We got to be careful , " Skyler said as they approached the Campus . " Can you walk without a limp ? " " Damn right I can . " And he did . The boys returned six days later . Kuta was sitting under a palm tree , repairing a fishing net , which was spread out on the sand before him . Raisin walked up and sat on a rock five feet away , silently watching as the bony black hands moved a three-inch needle back and forth through the wire mesh . Skyler sat next to Raisin and they stayed like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally Kuta broke the silence . " What you lookin ' at , child ? " Raisin shrugged , gave a hint of a smile and replied simply : " You . " " What 's a matter ? Never seen a body work before ? " " Not sitting down . " And so was born an unusual friendship . Skyler and Raisin visited Kuta about once every two weeks , whenever they could get together and whenever they dared to risk it , moving cautiously along the path to make sure they were unobserved and looking in his window to see if he was alone . He always was . He had been married twice , but both women lived on the mainland and he had n't seen either for years . He seemed equally fond of both wives , and he loved talking about themespecially how good they were in bed . Talk like this intrigued Skyler and Raisin because they had been separated from girls for the past year and any mention of sex was forbidden at the lab . They asked so many questions about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowed to take them to a house he knew in Charlestona prospect that almost literally took their breath away . Raisin jumped at the idea , then sulked when Kuta said he was joking . He was always trying to get Kuta to take them out in his boat " just to go fishing , " he pleaded , though Skyler suspected there was more to it than thatand Kuta kept coming up with excuses : the boat needed repair , the engine had thrown a valve , the tide was wrong . Finally one day he looked Raisin straight in the eye and said : " You know those people in that Big House would have my hide . They own just about the whole island . What you tryin ' to do to me , child ? " Still , the old man seemed to luxuriate in his role as life guide . He filled their heads with Gullah historyrecounting such stories as the ancestors who had stepped off a slave ship onto this very island and turned to march directly back into the ocean toward Africa , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would turn serious , shaking his head and pronouncing " something wrong-headed " about its strict doctrines . He thought it peculiar to get all those inoculations " they turning you into pincushions , for what ? " he demanded . And he derived a pleasure in dispensing subversive notions . " Do n't see no harm in running , " he would say . " A boy 's got ta stretch his legs if he 's to become a man . And what 's wrong in leaving the island ? It do n't make no sense to stay cooped up here your whole life . " For their part , the old man was a window to the outside world , the only person they had ever met who was not in the Lab . They loved the forbidden hours in his shack , sitting on the bed with broken springs , hanging on his every word . The trumpet was always hanging from its peg upon the wall , and on special occasionsmeaning when the spirit moved himKuta would take it down and play a riff or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a television , but they preferred listening to the radio . It was turned during the afternoons to a DJ called Bozman , who spilled out the words in singsong Gullah . " Disya one fa all ob de oomen . Dey a good-good one fa dancin . " And Kuta would translate : " This one 's for all the women out there . It 's good dance music . " The broadcastfrom the mainlandalmost made them shiver , it was so illicit and enthralling . It did not escape Skyler that all this talk of freedom and sex was feeding Raisin 's discontent . Increasingly , he began talking of his dream of going to " the other side . " As the months passed , he became more and more rebellious , always in trouble of one kind or another . He began standing up to the Orderlies , talking back , openly obstreperous . And punishments lost their effect . His head was shaved bald , which was meant to humiliate him ; he seemed to wear it as a badge of honor . Food was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raisin was called in to see the Psychologist Physician . There was a report that he had been seen masturbating , which he did not deny . Nor did he deny hiding the dinnertime pills ; he seemed to enjoy leading a search party of three Orderlies that marched straight to the barracks and found the cache of tablets under his bed . The Elders confined him to the Campushe had long since lost his right to gather honeywhich meant he could no longer slip away to see Kuta . Skyler realized that the prohibition would be hard to bear . One afternoon , Raisin was discovered in the woods ; Skyler alone knew where he had been . He was removed from the barracks and consigned for three nights to solitary confinement in " the Box . " Skyler tried to visit him there . The first night , he got close enough to hear Raisin talking to himself , playing with his toy soldier , but he had to leave when someone approached . The next night , he found that the Orderlies had placed the guard dogs around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon , Skyler saw Raisin only at a distance in odd moments , his bald head bobbing as he carried out garbage from the Meal House or cleaned the toilets or submitted to some other discipline . He was confined for days on end in the basement of the Big Houselocked inside a room at night , according to the rumors . It was Patrick who told Skyler this , and he broke the news gently , out of deference to their friendship . One hot morning , Skyler was crossing an upper field on the Campus when he walked by the vegetable garden and heard his name being whispered . He looked around , but saw no one . Again , he heard it , coming from behind a row of waist-high corn . He ducked behind it and there was Raisin . He had been sent to do weeding , and his head and cheek were smudged with dirt . His hair was growing back in ungainly clumps , his eyes looked pink and watery , and he was disturbingly gaunt . He had a wild look about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , grabbing Skyler 's arm and squeezing it so tightly it almost hurt . " You have to come , too . The things I 've learneddown there , in the basement . You have no idea what 's going on . Horrible things . We all have to get away . " Skyler did n't want this . He was scared . Raisin was acting so strangelythere were little bubbles of spittle at the corner of his lips , and he seemed to be babbling with the urgency of what he wanted to say . The others would be coming right behind him andSkyler felt a stab of guilthe knew he would get into trouble for being with him . Still , Raisin was his friend , his oldest friend . He needed him . Skyler would hear him out and do whatever he wanted . " I want you to come with me , " Raisin said . " I can break out . Tomorrow night . We 'll meet at the boathouse and take the boat . We 'll go on to the other side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safe . " Skyler agreed . He felt dread in his stomach . The others were approaching . " Eight o'clock " whispered Raisin . " Eight o'clock at the boathouse . Do n't be late ! " The next night Skyler felt his heart pounding as the hour approached . He listened carefully for the chiming of the grandfather clock in the Big House and heard it strike seven . He made a small bundletwo shirts , an extra pair of socks , a small pocketknife , a paperback book on Charles Darwinto carry with him . The mainland ! What would it be like ? His hands and feet felt cold with fear . I 'm a good friend , he told himself a loyal friend . Then something unforeseen happened . There was a noise way off in the distance , a thin crash that sounded a bit like glass breaking . It could have come from the Big House , though he was n't sure . He listened intently , but everything was quiet . Five or ten minutes later , he heard footsteps , a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The door swung open and in stepped an Orderly . He surveyed the room , pulled a chair up against the door and sat in it , his arms folded . The other Jimminies were stunned ; nothing like this had ever happened before . Gradually , they settled down . One by one Skyler heard them drop off to sleep , the sounds of their steady breathing . He stole looks over his blanket at the Orderly , sitting there , implacable . Skyler waited . He watched . Then he , too , fell asleep . He awoke sometime in the early morning hours . The chair was beside the door , empty . Otherwise , nothing had changed . He leapt out of bed , dressed and went to the door , leaving the bundle behind under his bed . When he stepped outside , he could see dawn was already coming up in the east . He ran to the boathouse . And then his heart soared . The lock was brokenthe door was swinging open a half foot or so . He crept up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled it wider , peering inside . The light was dim . There was the slip inside between two narrow docks that hugged the walls , the sound of water lapping the base of the piers . And on the other side the bay doors were openhe could see straight through to the bay . The boat was gone ! Outside , four feet from the door , he saw a small object . He bent to examine it and then picked it up and held it in his hand . Raisin 's toy soldier . That afternoon , he learned that Raisin had never made it to the mainland . He had lost his way in the marshes , they were told , and at high tide the boat had been caught in the treacherous currents . It had capsized and he had drowned . The boat had been discovered floating upside down a half mile from shore , and when it had been turned upright , Raisin had been found , his lungs filled with water , his face a ghostly blue and one leg caught under the wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the escape had brought on a seizure . He managed to say some good things about Raisin . Julia , Patrick and many of the other Jimminies wept openly ; something in Raisin 's whole saga touched a chord of tragedy in their world , and they sensed it would never be the same . As for Skyler , he was too devastated even to cry . He felt he had lost his only brother . He put some of the blame on Kuta . For a while , he stopped coming to the shack , but then , when he found he missed the old man a great deal , he resumed his occasional visits . He still basked in the warmth of his company , but it was n't the same . When there had been three of them , the old man talking and the two boys drinking it in like wine , it had felt like a family . Lying in bed , Skyler marveled at the human mind . Here he had tried to avoid thinking about Raisin and his death a decade ago . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his mind had led him on a back route to that self-same destination . He felt his hands and feet go cold again , just as they had that fateful night . He reached under the bed and searched with one hand for the object . When he did n't find it at once , he feared that it was missing , but then he struck it with his finger . He lifted the wooden soldier up and placed it under the thin blanket . Raisin dead . Now Patrick . Who would be next ? How many more would there be ? Had Raisin been right : were none of them safe ?
