<p> West Palm Beach , Fla. - <p> The mall . The traffic . The crowds . And that infernal " Have a Holly , Jolly Christmas " over the loudspeakers . Just the thought of gathering enough energy for holiday shopping is enough to send some of us scurrying for mail-order catalogs . Unlike clothes or gadgets , food gifts fit almost any recipient  --  everybody eats . But you can personalize your gift  --  deliver a taste of a hometown left behind ( rugalach from New York City ) or adventuresome flavors of a favorite city ( spicy El Paso Chile Co. salsas from Texas ) . Give buffet foods such as ham or cheese to lift the party spirits of a harried host . Sugarless and low-fat jams will do dieters proud . <p> But how do you choose among the food catalogs that are growing by the bushelful as this type of gift-giving gains popularity ? We did some homework for you . This past month , we phoned in orders for several gift foods from different sources and catalogs . We noted delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expensive venture  --  and the smaller the order , the larger the percentage of delivery cost . We kept that in mind while weighing flavor and delivery . A note about our research : I ordered all foods as gifts , never revealing my affiliation with a newspaper . The charges were put on a credit card , and I received bills separately from the foods . All of the phone representatives were polite and helpful . We tracked delivery time , but note that this is not crunch time just before the major holidays . Most companies have cutoff dates between Dec. 5 and Dec. 21 for Christmas Day delivery ; there is a two-day rush delivery available from most of the firms at an extra charge . Staff members helped me taste the foods , and gave their opinions on flavor and whether they would consider giving them as a gift . El Paso Chile Co. dips The cost : $ 15 ( $ 10 for three jars , and $ 5 freight ) . The source : El Paso Chile Company , 909 Texas St. , El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One jar had a loose seal , however , and the contents were spoiled . The representative was polite when called about the problem . Jar was reordered , but had not arrived in a week . Flavor : The two that were intact , two olive roasted garlic salsa and the white bean dip , rated high  --  not too spicy or bland . The verdict : $ 5 per jar ( 11.5 to 16 ounces ) is n't too pricey for the quality . Order these for party hosts , football watchers or ex-Texans . Divine Delights Pumpkin Teacake and Christmas petit fours and truffles The cost : $ 61.65 for all . $ 27.95 for truffles ; $ 23.75 for pumpkin teacake plus $ 9.95 freight .

Delivery : Six-day delivery . <p> Flavor : Our tasters were tongue-tied thinking of superlatives to describe these attractive chocolate and candy morsels . The chocolates were incredibly creamy and the pumpkin teacake was moist and tasty with a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petit fours may seem pricey , but they 're a bargain compared to other gourmet chocolates . The teacake ad says it serves eight , but we got 16 servings easily from it . We 'd love to receive these ourselves . Biringer Farm Raspberry Shortbread The cost : $ 18.90 ; $ 12.95 for shortbread ; $ 5.95 shipping . The source : Biringer Farm Products Inc. , 3715 134th St. N.E. , Marysville , WA 98271. 1-800-448-8212 . Delivery : Six-day delivery . Flavor : We were evenly divided  --  and passionate  --  about this product . Many said it tasted pasty and the texture was too soft , with mundane raspberry filling . Others loved the buttery crust and fresh-fruit tasting filling . The verdict : This shortbread was a finalist in the most recent Fancy Food Show where gift and boutique foods are exhibited . It was one of the most attractive products we ordered . Unless you 'd make and ship your own shortbread , this is a fine alternative . A good gift for a holiday host , or a household with children . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/2-pound tin : $ 29.99 , including $ 5 shipping . The source : The Best of New York City , 389 Broome St. , New York , NY 10013. 1-800-538-5055 . Delivery : Four-day delivery . Flavor : The cinnamon-raisin flavored cookie was mediocre , drawing neither praise nor criticism . The verdict : With only an average flavor , it 's tough to justify the almost $ 30 price . Better to go to a local bakery and pack your own tin at about half the cost . Perfectly Sweet Sugar-Free Raspberry Swirl Cheesecake made with Simply Sweet Vanilla Flavored Sugar Substitute ( Maltitol ) . The cost : $ 27.78 : $ 16 for cheesecake ; $ 4.50 for Simply Sweet ; $ 5.95 shipping and $ 1.33 sales tax . The source : Perfectly Sweet Inc. , 2550 N.W. 72nd Ave. , No. 318 , Miami , FL 33122. 1-800-815-0009 . Delivery : Overnight delivery ( this may change with holiday ordering ) . Cheesecake was shrink-wrapped , with cold packs included . Flavor : The cheesecake was the big disappointment . Most said it was sour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They praised the texture , however . The sweetener was a favorite for its honeylike texture and no overly sweet aftertaste . The verdict : The cake was crudely packaged , and somewhat shriveled . As for Simply Sweet , this is the newest darling of the chef set because it holds up in , and adds texture to , baked goods like no dry sugar substitute . The company gets kudos for packing a free sugarless cookbook and samples of other sugar-free products with our order . We do n't recommend the cake , but the sweetener is first-rate . Blue Crab Bay Co . Soups : Crab Norfolk , Chesapeake Cioppino , She-Crab Soup The cost : $ 27.90 ; $ 21.95 for three soups , plus $ 5.95 shipping . The source : Blue Crab Bay Co. , P.O.

The source : Natural Exotic Tropicals , 2780 E. Oakland Park Blvd. , Fort Lauderdale , FL 33306 . Order through Cushman 's Fruit Co. in West Palm Beach , 561-965-3535 . Flavor : None of our tasters knew these condiments  --  orange marmalade , raspberry and strawberry jams  --  were artificially sweetened . They were bowled over by the intense fruit flavors ; raspberry and orange marmalade were favorites . The verdict : These come in plain jars with attractive but commercial labels . We recommend them , especially for those on special diets . Trio of Baby Peppered Hams The cost : $ 55.75 ; $ 48 for three 2 1/2-pound hams plus $ 7.75 for shipping .
