Palestinian security officials had a plan . Contemplating a new confrontation with the Israeli military , they took an inventory of all the tractors and bulldozers in the West Bank . Then they devised a system for appropriating the machinery to dig ditches and build other obstacles to slow an Israeli advance . But how to test the scheme ? In mid-January an opportunity was literally heaven-sent . When a rare blizzard blanketed the West Bank with snow , Palestinian authorities quickly seized the earthmovers under the pretense of clearing the roads . In fact , the action was a drill for war . <P> The visit to the region this week by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has focused the spotlight on diplomacy for the moment . But with the peace process stalled , military commanders will get no rest . The Israeli army has long plotted and rehearsed its options in the Palestinian territories ; Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 's forces are now rushing to catch up . <P> According to a senior Palestinian security official , Arafat 's contingency plan calls for the escalation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still stationed within and just outside Palestinian cities . The idea would be to provoke the Israelis into re-entering urban areas now under Palestinian control , where they would come under fire not only from Arafat 's official forces but also from illegally armed Palestinians . The result would be high casualties on both sides . Arafat , according to the security official , believes a large death toll would force the U.S. to step in to stop the bloodletting and , presumably , impose a diplomatic solution that would give the Palestinians greater autonomy . <P> In any future fight , the forces of the Palestinian Authority will be better equipped than they were for their four-day mini-war with Israel in September 1996 . In that encounter they had only the small arms permitted them under the peace accords . Since then they have been smuggling in larger , forbidden weapons including , Palestinian officials say , mortars , antitank missiles and even , according to one source , a score of Katyusha rockets with a range of 12 miles . Authorities in Israel assume that several armor-piercing heavy machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . According to Israeli intelligence , the Palestinians have developed a formal war room that is mobile and headed by Brigadier General Haj Ismail , overall military commander of the West Bank . The Israelis also report that the Palestinians , anticipating future casualties , have expanded trauma units and morgues . <P> Arafat , in Israel 's estimation , regards the war option only as a desperate last resort in case diplomacy fails altogether . Still , Israel has developed and simulated multiple plans for battling the Palestinians anew , including one code-named " Field of Thorns , " which calls for the retaking of the West Bank cities . Both sides know two things in advance of another fight : Israel will win it , and it will be horribly painful . " It 'll be much bigger than last September , " says an Israeli commander . " Much crueler , much bloodier , much more complicated . " <P>  --  By Lisa Beyer/Nablus . With reporting by Jamil Hamad/Nablus and Aharon Klein/Jerusalem               @ @ @ @ @ @
