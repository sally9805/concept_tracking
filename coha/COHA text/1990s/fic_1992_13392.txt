( The set represents a grungy Montreal apartment . There should be an old couch , which faces the audience , a big stuffed chair , a coffee table , and a television set with rabbit ears . There should be something to suggest two doors , one leading to the outside hall , another to the kitchen . There should be something to suggest a window , covered in blinds . There is a bookcase containing an almost complete collection of Batman comics . There are two sets of stairs leading from the audience to the stage , one on each side . DAVE enters . He looks for DOUG . He gets the cheezies and places them in front of the couch in readiness . He waits . He looks at the television set . He turns off the lights . He waits . He looks at the television set . He wanders around . Finally he stands in front of the set and , as if telepathically hooked into the timing , he turns on the TV . A slight pause . He races to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star Trek , the Next Generation . " We hear Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise say , " Space , the final frontier . These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise . . . " DAVE slowly transforms into Captain Picard . DOUG bursts into the apartment . He is gasping for breath , as if he 's run a great distance in a terrible state of desperation . He staggers to the sofa , throws himself on it and stares needily at the screen . He grabs for the cheezies . He calms down gradually as the opening sequence of " Star Trek " continues and becomes Commander Will Riker of the Starship Enterprise . DAVE and DOUG , Captain and Number One , watch in rapt attention . The lights dim briefly . Two full episodes have passed . We hear the ending sequence of the last " Star Trek " episode . DAVE turns off the set . ) DOUG I could make coffee . p. 3 DAVE There 's no milk . DOUG Did n't you get some the last time you were out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . DOUG You said you went to the store . I 'm sure you did . DAVE There 's still no milk . DOUG I need a coffee . DAVE Yeah , something to get us going . You ca n't be a filmmaker without coffee . DOUG They do n't drink coffee anymore . They do n't smoke , they do n't fuck actresses . You do n't even say " actress " anymore , you say " actor . " DAVE Hell , we can think without coffee . DOUG Where 's the application form ? DOUG I do n't know . DAVE Okay , so there 's these two guys and there 're bombing along in a car , and there 's great music playing and they meet people . It 's a low-budget kind of thing . DOUG Who do they meet ? DAVE Okay , so there 's these two guys in an apartment and they 're videotaping each other . p. 4 DOUG That 's good . Okay , so you see a double image , a screen and a screen and maybe someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play with the image a bit . I could shoot that . You could put a mirror in the shot . So there 's the video image , the image of the video , the video-taping of the video-taping , and then three reflections in a mirror . What a shot . What a . . . DOUG It goes on at the Festival . People are lining up to look down their noses . The Europeans loved it , but what do people who 've spent thousands of years killing each other really know ? The audience files in , dressed to the nines in designer clothes from Flare magazine . They sit back , willing it to be bad . Then the first laugh comes , just a titter , but it breaks the ice . The videoing of the videoing comes on the huge screen . They 're amazed . How did they get that shot ? And on no money too . By the end they 're on their feet , stomping and cheering . Some of them are cringing and weeping with jealousy , they wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and humbly mumble into the mike . DAVE How come you did n't get milk when you were out ? DOUG I was n't really out . I think I just delivered the rent upstairs . DAVE I think I threw away that application form . p. 5 DOUG No problem . Have you ever wondered how an android can have a fully functioning penis ? DAVE We do n't need milk . We need a miracle . ( The hallway door opens and ANNA bursts in and flops on the chair . ) ANNA Oh god , you would n't believe it . It was unbearable . Look at my knees , they 'll never recover , you do n't know , you just do n't know . It took an eternity , and my grandmother , she 's like in this ecstasy of torture . You look up and there 's nothing but stairs and more stairs . Then a place to put your money . Then more stairs . Meanwhile people are just walking up beside you , quite happily , just walking up in the walking place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in the kneeling place . Your knees are stripped to bleeding shreds . You 've got nothing left , nothing left , nothing left . DAVE The last one was a really good episode and we 've only seen it a couple of times before . DOUG The whole crew of the Enterprise got together and gave Worf a Klingon rite of passage ritual . They lined up fake Klingons on the holodeck and they poked him with pain sticks . DAVE He goes , " Auuughhh augghhh " and falls to his knees and screams out cool shit about being a warrior , then he gets up and they zap him again . p. 6 DOUG At the end he 's on the ground , sweat all over his forehead-groove and he goes , " Thank you . " DAVE It was beautiful . ANNA You 're not going to ask me are you ? Look at my knees . A scrub woman 's knees . A Catholic peasant 's knees . This guy on a train once said he loved my feet and hands because they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mitts and boots on so it was pretty incredible that he knew that . DOUG Sure we are . DAVE You just have to give us a chance . ANNA Okay . DAVE What ? ANNA So ask me . DAVE What ? ANNA I went to St. Joseph 's Oratory . Come on guys , you remember , the giant basilica thing on the mountain ? DAVE Are there any cheezies left ? DOUG I could go to the store . ANNA With the old crutches on the walls and Brother Andre 's room all encased in glass with his curtains decayed and shredding and his heart on display . . . I mean , his real heart in a box with formaldehyde . Total , musty , mouldy , imitation medieval Catholic weirdness. p. 7 DAVE Any miracles ? Brother Andre 's supposed to do miracles is n't he ? Not him but his ghost or something . DOUG Brother Andre is dead . ANNA The only miracle was that my grandmother made it up all those stairs , no , the real miracle is that I made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go tomorrow . I said I 'd go with her all week . That 's seven days . Come with me ? Just one day . Get me through . Come on . DOUG You mean go outside ? DAVE Past the corner store ? We ca n't do that . ANNA Why not ? DAVE You know why not . ANNA You might miss the mail with Doug 's mother 's weekly cheque ? You 'll catch cold ? DOUG Very funny . ANNA You ca n't miss " Star Trek . " I read that the guy that plays Jean-Luc Picard is a real asshole . DOUG Stop ! ANNA Arrogant and mean on the set , bossing everybody around . . . DAVE Stop it ! ANNA A total asshole . Doing that whole British , " I talk through my nose and do n't say my Rs , so everybody else is a wiener .

Up the stairs with my granny and me . . . DOUG Why are you doing it ? ANNA It 's for my grandmother . She asked me and she 's , well she 's , you know , pretty soon she 's going to . . . you know . DAVE Die ? ANNA Well . . . yeah . DAVE What 's she got ? ANNA She 's Italian . She has n't got anything , she 's eighty years old . DAVE She 's got life . DOUG And she 's dying .

You know what I mean ? p. 9 DAVE Yeah , you 're afraid she 's going to you know and you 'll feel like you 've never been nice to her . ANNA I 'm going to make coffee , anybody want one ? DOUG There 's no milk . ANNA Have n't you guys got milk yet ? The last time I was here . . . DAVE You think it 's easy ? Sure , just go to the corner store . You have to get your courage up , go outside , look at the guy at the counter . Then on top of all that , he speaks to you in French . DOUG Not nice clear Parisian French which I might be able to understand but a heavily-accented local patois French that we never learned in school . And then they laugh at you . DAVE Yeah , they laugh at us . DOUG They say we dress badly . They say we have no sense of humour . They say we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You English . Where is your laughter ? Where is your heart ? " They say we do n't know any good wines . DOUG Do you ? DAVE Do I what ? DOUG Do you know any good wines ? p. 10 DAVE No . DOUG So big deal , right ? DAVE Yeah , big deal . DOUG Then they 're nice afterwards , and talk English , but you know they 're thinking we have no nuances . ANNA What ? DOUG Nuances . They think . . . DAVE They think English people are wieners . ANNA Do n't worry about it , it 's just a language problem . Come with me tomorrow . We can put blinders on you , so you do n't have to look at anything , or talk to anybody . DOUG Not enough information . Counsellor Troi feels you 're hiding something . ANNA I 'm not . The only thing is , Grandma 's going a bit batty . She mumbles on about wanting to make contact with her dead husband or something . DAVE Now you 're making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with present life forms . DOUG And our resources and crew are being asked to assist . What could be clearer ? ANNA So you 'll come ? DAVE Well , you know it 's . . . p. 11 DOUG Yeah , things are . . . DAVE It 's just that things are a little . . . ANNA My grandmother is out there , lost in space . She needs you . I need you . It 's your chance to explore new horizons and energy forms . DOUG That is our mission . DAVE Can we turn our backs on a call for help , sir ? DOUG If it endangers the safety of this ship , yes , Number One . ANNA I 'll go to the store for you for a week . Milk , cheezies , Kraft Dinner , Ding Dongs , Mae Wests . . . DOUG We need some time . Perhaps you 'd better go . ANNA Go ? DOUG No , I did n't mean go , I meant , like into the kitchen . . . ANNA Into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps a little " tact " would n't be out of order , Captain . DOUG Oh . Yes , of course . We need some privacy in order to discuss the situation in a logical and orderly fashion . ANNA Oh , because I thought you meant that . . . p. 12 DOUG No I did n't mean . . . ANNA Because I do n't stick around where I 'm not . . . DOUG No . And why should you . . . ANNA Exactly , I mean . . . DAVE Should I escort our visitor to her quarters , sir ? ANNA That 's okay , I think I know the ship well enough . Just do n't expect me to do the dishes . Nuances . . . ( ANNA exits to kitchen . ) DOUG Well ? DAVE It 's not as if it 's a big deal or anything . DOUG No . Not a big deal . DOUG I mean , " so what ? " DAVE So what . DOUG Really . Help Anna out . . . DAVE Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are you ? DAVE Not that I remember . DOUG It 's better that way . DAVE Yeah . Do you have Batman number 497 ? And if you do , I 'd be willing to trade you my first edition Dark Knight , that way I 'd almost have a subset and you 'd almost have a subset . p. 13 DOUG I do n't have it . All those comics and neither one of us even has a subset . DAVE They 're worth a lot anyway . DOUG Not that much . DAVE A fair amount . DOUG When was the last time we took them down to the guy at Thor 's Comics and asked ? It was n't that much , not for all those years of work . ANNA ( Calling from the kitchen . ) I 'm getting tired of looking at these Kraft Dinners . DOUG Might as well . DAVE I think so . As long as we do n't miss  --  DOUG Do n't even say it . DAVE We 'll make her swear we 'll be back on time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One , prepare an " Away Team . " DAVE Yes sir ! ANNA ( From the kitchen . ) Guys ! DOUG Come . ( As ANNA enters the lights dim and change . Lights snap up : the next day . The door bursts open . ANNA , DAVE , and DOUG , breathing in gasps , tear into the apartment and fall on the couch and floor . With his last strength DOUG reaches up and turns on the television . The very last strains of the ending of a " Star Trek " episode fill the air. ) p. 14 DAVE Nooo ! ( He beats his hands and feet on the floor in a full scale heart-rending tantrum . ) DOUG ( Raging and hysterical . ) You swore ! You swore we 'd be back in time ! DAVE Liar ! Betrayer ! They 're gone , they 're gone . DOUG I ca n't stand it . DAVE No one to take us through safely . . . DOUG No moral at the end so we know there are good people in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . DOUG Alone in the darkness . . . DAVE Like that episode with that giant oil-slick life-entity . . . DOUG The oil slick entity was too bitter , the ship went off , leaving him alone on a whole planet . . . ANNA Oh , get a life . DOUG What did you say ? ANNA I said , you know , get a  --  DOUG Life . Yes . DAVE Yes . p. 15 DOUG ( With great dignity . ) You are referring , of course , to the television skit , where William Shatner , formerly Captain James T. Kirk of the USS Enterprise , confronted a group of so called " trekkies " and said . . . DAVE " Get a life . " DOUG Get a life . Very smart . Very cute . Very superficially funny in a postmodern sophomoric satiric fashion . But consider this is the man who spends his entire life trying to recreate his role as Captain of the Enterprise . DAVE He ca n't get away from it . He searches for the Enterprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universe and he ca n't get back . He lost his ship and he ca n't get back . He 's ruined , as an actor and as a person . DOUG " Get a life , " indeed . DAVE Indeed . ANNA Sorry . I 'm truly sorry . But if you had n't wanted to see Brother Andre 's room again we would have been able to . . . DAVE A hundred stairs . You never said there 'd be a hundred stairs . ANNA You were the one reading all the stories beside the crutches . . . p. 16 DAVE You had to light every candle . . . ANNA You were the one saying the wrong words to the Our Father at the top of your lungs . . . DAVE I got into it . Is there anything wrong with that ? DOUG He 's not going to make it , is he ? ANNA Who ? DOUG Brother Andre . He 's not going to get made a saint . You can see the campaign is flagging . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now , even with all those signatures on the petition , he 'll never make it . DAVE Starfleet is n't moved by popular appeal . They have standards , complex processes , they come to decisions logically and fairly . . . ANNA There were n't very many fibreglass crutches . They were mostly rotting wood with leather armpit things . . . DAVE People stop believing . DOUG When was the last miracle ? ANNA How should I know ? DOUG Does your grandmother ? ANNA Who knows ? She never even went to church and all of sudden she 's super Catholic . Doug ? p. 17 DOUG Yeah ? ANNA How are you doing ? DOUG How am I doing ? ANNA Yeah . DAVE What about me ? How am I doing ? How are you doing , Dave ? Not bad , except I missed my reason for living today , that 's all . DOUG I 'm fine . ANNA I got to thinking when we were going up the stairs . DAVE You were supposed to be praying . ANNA How come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movies are for wieners . Besides it 's " films . " DOUG Wieners make films . ANNA But you used to want to just get that camera and go out and film people and . . . DOUG Too much snow . DAVE " Just get a camera . " Sure . " Just go out there and get a camera . " Ha ! ANNA Sorry , it 's your business . DOUG A guy gets tired . He needs to hole up and think . p. 18 ANNA ( To DOUG . ) Did we ever sleep together ? DAVE No . DOUG Halfway once I think . ANNA When was that ? DOUG Do n't remember . ANNA Funny , eh ? DOUG Yeah . ANNA Come with me tomorrow ? I promise , I 'll keep an eye on the time and we 'll be back for . . . you know . . . DOUG Sure . DAVE Captain ? DOUG Number One ? DAVE Are n't you forgetting something ? DOUG Am I ? DAVE With a decision of this magnitude , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh . Yes , of course Number One . ANNA Do n't mind me , I know where to go , and I 'm still not washing the dishes . ( ANNA exits to the kitchen . ) DOUG When I said , " sure , " I meant , you know , both of us . I mean . . . p. 19 DAVE Well , I was n't , you know , sure , if you 'd rather go alone or with . . . DOUG Well no . I mean , if you do n't want to . . . DAVE No , I think , you know , if it 's all right with . . . DOUG As long as you want . . . DAVE Well , I mean you were the one that said . . . DOUG But I did n't mean that . . . DAVE It 's hard to tell . DOUG Yeah . DAVE Yeah . DOUG And of course , there 's no question of us missing . . . DAVE No , that was a fluke . DAVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Are you guys finished ? DAVE Finished what ? ( Lights dim and change . Lights snap up . It is the next day . The door bursts open . ANNA , DAVE , and DOUG catapult into the room in the same way as before . ) DAVE Just the ending . Just the music . . . p. 20 DOUG I 've got it , I 've got it . . . ( He turns the TV on , we hear the last lines . Picard : " If there are more people with the courage of Admiral Jarrock , then one day , we will see a day of peace , when we will be able to take his letter home . " The ending music of " Star Trek , the Next Generation " plays . ) DAVE What ? What letter ? What Jarrock ? DOUG We 'll never know . DAVE I ca n't take it , I really ca n't take this . ANNA Sorry ! I 'm sorry . I do n't know how it happened . We get up those bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crutches , then Dave wants to see Brother Andre 's room . . . I 've got to have a coffee . . . ( She exits to the kitchen . ) DAVE I ca n't stand it . The hole in my heart , in my guts , the ache . . . DOUG But there 's always that hole . When we 've seen both episodes , and it 's over and the night stretches in front of us . . . DAVE I know , I know , but still , we 've had something , then it 's over , I can stand that . . . DOUG I think I saw something on the way back . We were running , but I think I saw something . p. 21 DAVE What ? You did n't look around did you ? DOUG You know the clothes store that used to be down the street ? DAVE The Town and Country ? DOUG Closed , boarded up . DAVE No . My mother used to get all her stuff there . The most boring clothes in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOUG What ? DAVE People , not just rubbies , hundreds of them , lining up for the shelter . And something about a vote and posters about the Federation . . . I could n't really read them , they were all in Fren  --  DOUG Things looked different . Everyone looked kind of . . . shocked . DAVE Yeah . Maybe we should n't go tomorrow . DOUG People ca n't take on the whole world . ( ANNA returns . ) ANNA There 's no milk . DAVE Was n't it you who promised to go to the store ? Could n't remember eh ? Too scared to go in the store ? Sorry . ANNA It 's okay . p. 22 DAVE I did n't mean to . . . ANNA No , really , I underst  --  DAVE I 'm just a little rattled . . . ANNA It 's fine Dave ! DOUG Okay . ( To Anna . ) How are your knees ? ANNA Bad . How are yours ? DOUG Sore . ANNA Thanks for asking . DOUG Do n't mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that room again . The glass wall , sealing in the rotting cotton coverlet , the Bible , just where Brother Andre left it . The sense his room is in a time warp . Then the heart , brown and almost pumping . . . ANNA I ca n't believe they display that bloody heart . It 's sick . DAVE You have to have a relic to get declared a saint , and that guy is a saint , I 'm sure of it . ANNA How can you be so sure ? DAVE When you 've watched as much television as I have , you become slightly telepathic. p. 23 ANNA You need three fully substantiated miracles to get made a saint . That means , if it 's a cure , no hysterical illnesses , they have to have doctors reports , witnesses , validations of all kinds . Then if it 's something like the sun coming down from the sky and twirling around , they really have to investigate . DAVE Three eh ? ANNA It 's very complicated . DOUG Does your grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she first brought this whole novena thing up . I ca n't tell if she 's lost it completely or if she 's got something up her sleeve . DAVE Maybe her husband is n't dead . Maybe she 's meeting him in that room with the weird candles and they 're having illicit sex . ANNA She 's my grandma and I love her . DAVE Nobody said you did n't love her , I just . . . ANNA That was a stupid joke and they 're not weird candles . DAVE You 're the one that talks about Catholic weirdness  --  ANNA It 's okay for me to talk , I used to be Catholic , and she 's my grandmother and  --  p. 24 DAVE Okay . Okay ANNA Geez . DOUG Anna , nobody said you did n't love your grandmother . Okay ? ANNA Okay . DOUG Okay ? DAVE Anna , when was the last time you went past the corner store ? ANNA Listen , I know it 's been rough but are you coming tomorrow ? DAVE When was the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't remember . DAVE Aha ! What do you do instead of watch " Star Trek " ? ANNA I . . . I read Clan of the Cave Bear over and over again . DAVE What ? ANNA You know , " Ayla " ? It 's set at the dawn of mankind . . . personkind . . . whatever . Ayla is this prehistoric woman and she 's more evolved than everybody . She 's raised by the Clan of the Cave Bear and they 're kind of the missing link , or she 's the missing link , I 'm not sure . I do n't really think so because she 's really good-looking and the missing link would have a really low forehead . . . Anyway she invents weapons , medicines , she loves animals and trains them , shoots them too even though the clan does n't like a woman who hunts , but she is Woman who Hunts . She 's independent and strong , not feisty , feisty is for wieners , but independent and blond and  --  p. 25 DAVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautician or something ? ANNA Cosmetic hygienist . Ayla gathers herbs and grasses , makes teas for people , uses bison grease as a moisturiser . And , besides , that was just going to be something to fall back on . I had other plans , they just . . . DAVE Ahh , what about those great days when you used to talk about wrapping old ladies in bear drippings and scrubbing off their cellulite with prehistoric pineapples ? What happened to your dreams ? DOUG Dave . . . DAVE A necessary challenge , Captain , in my opinion . DOUG I understand , Number One , but diplomacy is the study of human relations . ANNA It 's okay , I 'm tougher than you think . I can take it . Are you coming tomorrow ? DAVE I regret being harsh but we needed to know our situation , sir . DOUG Agreed . DAVE This mission is turning out to be a lot more dangerous than we thought . ANNA Not only can I take it . I deserve it . Are you coming tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 26 DAVE Are you sure ? DOUG Not entirely . ANNA I give up . What you ask for , you get . If you like wieners , you get stuck with wieners . And more wieners and more wieners . . . DAVE On the other hand , it 's true sir , the honour of the Enterprise is at stake . DOUG We have also received a distress call . Can we ignore it for the sake of our personal safety ? ANNA It 's not life or death or anything . . . DOUG No ? ANNA We 'll be back on time , I promise . ( Lighting change . The next day . The door opens . ANNA , DAVE , and DOUG slowly enter . They have missed " Star Trek " completely this time . ) ANNA Okay . We go up the stairs on our knees with Grandma . DAVE We put money in the boxes . DOUG Dave prays too loudly and gets the words to the Our Father wrong . ANNA People look at us funny . DOUG Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 27 DAVE We get into the oratory . ANNA I light candles . DOUG And put in more money . ANNA We look at the crutches and wheelchairs . . . DAVE And the helmets , do n't forget the helmets . Some kid , who could n't help bashing his head against walls and floors , his parents take him in and all of a sudden . . . DOUG We look at the heart . DAVE It 's all brown and shrivelled and  --  ANNA Do n't . DAVE Your grandmother stares at the heart . DOUG We go outside and into the little humble church where Brother Andre lived . . . ANNA We look at his room , preserved behind the glass wall . . . DOUG But we do n't know how many hours have passed . ANNA We realize . We get scared . We run out of there , dragging Grandma behind us . DOUG We shove her into a cab . DAVE We run and run . p. 28 ANNA It 's like a dream . We ca n't run fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . DAVE Our lungs are burning , our hearts are bursting . . . ANNA And it 's too late . What can I say ? DAVE Do n't say " Get a life , " okay ? DOUG Imagine the miracle . It 's nineteen thirty-four , the Depression is wringing the nation of hope and laughter . The family slowly mount the stairs , carrying little Roger . He wears a helmet and braces , he 's compelled to bash his head against hard surfaces . They kneel , holding little Roger down . Suddenly the heart beats , the statue of Brother Andre twitches , little Roger rises . . . DAVE How many days left ? ANNA Three . DAVE Sir , it may be time for desperate measures . ANNA It 's true . I read Clan of the Cave Bear over and over again . " Ayla , clad in a designer doe-skin outfit she softened with her own teeth , strides through the prehistoric forest . . .

DAVE It 's just that this time , I can think of only one . ( Lights change . Later that night . We see ANNA 's figure , still sleeping on the couch . The door opens . DAVE and DOUG enter the room , carrying a heavy metal box . They speak in semi-whispers . ) DAVE Watch it , you 've got my fingers . . . DOUG Well just give me some room . . . DAVE Wait , it 's spilling . . . DOUG Oh , God , do n't make it spill . . . DAVE Noo . . . it 's okay . . . just over there . . . DOUG Where ? DAVE Wait . . . wait . . . DOUG Stop jiggling it .

A kind of fun thing for two guys to do . You know , a madcap scheme . Sneak into St. Joseph 's Oratory and . . . you know . . . DOUG What ? DAVE These two guys living together , right ? They 're kind of wild , really fun guys and they sneak into the oratory and they . . . DOUG Yes ? DAVE So they 're fun guys and they have lots of girls , but they 're kind of bad too , everybody envies them but likes them too and they have this . . . box .

DOUG I 'm going to throw up . DAVE You thought it was a good idea . DOUG It seemed to make sense . Something comes over me , I think , right , that 's what we have to do . It 's so easy .

DOUG You look . . . great . DAVE Yeah , great . DOUG Just . . . ANNA What ? DAVE Great . ANNA I look like I always look , and that 's never been great . DOUG You 've changed your hair . DAVE You 've squeezed that pimple you had on your . . . DOUG It 's the hair , Dave . ANNA I know you 're acting weird because we missed " you know what " and I just have to apologize again .

( A long silence . DAVE turns on the TV . ) Two o'clock in the morning . It 's on . The original . ( We hear " Space , the final frontier . . . " Lighting change . The next morning .

DOUG If Jean-Luc Picard was here , what would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff into a conference . DOUG They 'd give their opinions , he 'd listen in that way he has , then make his own decision . DAVE Counsellor Troi would say something about " I feel something , the tension on the ship is high . " DOUG Somebody would say , " You do n't have to be an empath to know that . " What a lousy part . Some empath . DAVE She just states the obvious . DOUG Yeah , she just states the obvious . ANNA The tension on the ship is very high . DOUG I 'm sorry Counsellor , but actually it 's very low . DAVE She never gets it right . ANNA We have to do something . DAVE Why ? ANNA Because Brother Andre 's heart is in that box ! ! DOUG Shhh . DAVE If we open it , will there be a miracle ? DOUG No . DAVE If we open it , will anything happen at all ? p. 37 DOUG No . DAVE If we open it , will the police come and take us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANNA I 'm opening it . I really am . Somebody stop me . ( She does n't move . ) DAVE Captain , we 've discovered something , it 's emitting energy rays on a frequency I 've never seen before . DOUG What is the possible danger to the crew ? DAVE I think it 's within reasonable limits , sir . DOUG Proceed . ANNA Do you remember when we were coming back last time ? Did you . . . see things ? DOUG Like what ? ANNA That young guy lying on the subway grate ? And not just the old lady that 's always camped out with all the bags , but three old ladies camped out with hardly any bags and one of them looked really pale and . . . DOUG Maybe . ANNA And when we turned the corner , all those people begging , like a line-up . . . p. 38 DAVE The Federation has eliminated hunger and poverty .

Get your butts over here and take a look at Brother Andre 's heart . Cowards ! Never-was-been filmmakers ! ( DAVE and DOUG get off the couch with dignity and peer briefly into the box. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really look like a heart at all . DOUG Maybe it 's a fake . The real heart is somewhere else . The Crown Jewels are on display in England but they 're not the real jewels . They 're very expensive replicas . DAVE It must be time soon . ANNA For what ? DAVE To meet your grandmother and go up the stairs . ANNA Are you out of your mind ? DAVE I think we should go . DOUG You may be right , Number One . Walk into the scene of the crime . Evaluate the situation , explore options , perhaps we should go in disguise . As if we were creating a holodeck program . . . DAVE Captain , we could create a basilica with a hundred stairs . DOUG Should we dress in character ? DAVE The priest 's outfits again , sir ? DOUG Or perhaps a bishop 's stole for myself , Number One . I hear the Church is run like Starfleet . ANNA There 's no such thing as a holodeck . There is a real St. Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the heart is really here ! And . . . you . . . wieners . . . p. 40 DOUG Let 's get going .

In huge headlines we read , " Brother Andre 's heart kidnapped " " Le Coeur Disparue ! " " Sacrilege ! " ANNA The police are everywhere . My grandmother staring at the empty spot . . . then we go to look at Brother Andre 's room and it 's like . . . DAVE Like the heart of it is n't there . ANNA They think we 're terrorists .

ANNA " The Partis Qubecois and the Bloque Qubecois have denied any knowledge of the kidnapping . " DOUG " The kidnapping is clearly linked to radical elements of the indpendantist movement rumoured to be in league with international terrorists dedicated to a break-up of the federation .

DAVE There 's no such thing as Yugoslavia . p. 42 DOUG What war are they talking about ? DAVE People have to shuffle off to Buffalo for chemotherapy .

DAVE The Federation is good and kind and true and noble and flexible and peaceful and . . . peace and niceness and multicultural . . . p. 43 DOUG No ! The Federation is shit . Smarmy self-satisfied bourgeoisie that thinks it 's so liberal till you scratch the surface and out come the neofascist Brownshirts in plaid . The Federation denies itself at the first sign of trouble . It 's nothing . It 's a lie ! DAVE But Captain . . . DOUG Do n't call me Captain . DAVE But Captain . . . DOUG Do n't call me . . .

( DOUG slams the door on GRANDMA . In a mad scramble , DAVE and DOUG carry the heart around , trying to hide it , until they think they have succeeded . DAVE opens the door . ) ( Warmly . ) Grandma . ( GRANDMA , carrying her bags , elbows her way into the room . The others stare . Silence . DAVE reaches behind the couch and brings out a half-eaten bag of cheezies . ) DAVE Cheezies ?

Speak to her in Italian . DOUG I 'll put on the universal translator , all frequencies . ANNA She speaks English , Earth English . ( GRANDMA pulls out some bread and a large stick of salami . She begins to make-up a bed on the floor , muttering and singing Italian hymns to herself . ) ANNA Grandma , what are you doing ? Talk to me . Please . ( GRANDMA opens up her sleeping bag . She is clearly camping out on the floor . ) DAVE Doug ? DOUG Yeah ? DAVE Where did you learn to toss off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kopeks ' class . ANNA Grandma . . . ( GRANDMA continues to unpack . ) DAVE Mr. Kopeks the football coach ? p. 46 DOUG Yeah , he had one great class in him , the French Revolution . DAVE Was he for it or against it ? DOUG Mixed .

GRANDMA Nineteen years old . I 'm nineteen years old . DAVE Curious . Captain , I 've never seen anything quite like it . DOUG Nor have I , Number One . ANNA It must be the formaldehyde , I feel the ship is getting a headache . DAVE You do n't know how to do it right . Counsellor Troi always says . . . ANNA What do you mean , I do n't know how to do it right ? It 's a stupid show , meaningless , exploitive , badly acted , terribly directed , inconsistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding that the viewer feel it 's meaningful or even hopeful about the future . It 's a piece of trash . Commander Riker is a wiener ! Captain Picard is a horseshit ex-Shakespearean actor condescending to the very pay cheque he 's selling himself for . Counsellor Troi is a bimbo in spandex ! ( Pause. ) p. 47 DAVE Commander Riker is not a wiener . GRANDMA Did you ever see the show where . . . what 's his face . . . Lieutenant Worf , they poke him with the pain sticks ? ( Pause . ) ANNA Nooo . . . DAVE Yeah , and all the Klingons line up in the holodeck . . . GRANDMA They stole that from the Catholics . DOUG We stole the heart from the oratory . ANNA Doug ! GRANDMA I know . DOUG You know ? GRANDMA I know . And you 'll be punished , but not yet . DOUG Why not yet ? GRANDMA Because the heart has certain powers . Because I want that heart all to myself . Come , sit around me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . I know she 's up to something .

DAVE The whole fleet is probably after us by now . DOUG Evasive action , Number One . GRANDMA Silence ! Lights ! ( Lights change to a dramatic spotlight . ) A long time ago , back in the old country , I was married very young . I knew nothing , a virgin . My husband was older , handsome , very gentle , but he had a terrible temper as well . One day he came home , when I was still sore from losing my pustch . He was on fire with anger . He grabbed me by the hair and dragged me to the village . In the square , two men held a young boy between them . My husband screamed that this was the boy I had betrayed him with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had certain thoughts about the boy , when we played together as children , but he had disappeared . And now that he was before me , I knew I had never stopped thinking certain thoughts about him . My husband shook the boy till I wanted to die . " Had he been putting it to me in his own bed ? " The boy denied it , looking at me all this time with his great brown eyes , eyes full of love . " Then why , " my husband screamed , " did I catch you outside my bedroom window , early in the morning ? " I was shocked . What had he been doing there ? The boy began to cry . He had loved me since he was a child but his parents had moved away from the village . He had worked and saved for years , to come back to the village , open a shop and marry me , but when he finally came , I was already married . So every night he kept watch outside my window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my husband was gone , so he could sneak in the window , and make love to me . But he said that moment had never come . I was sobbing . All the villagers were sobbing . But there was nothing to be done . My husband gave a great roar and cut the boy 's heart from his living body . Alphonso lay there in agony for a few seconds before death came , his chest a bowl of blood . He whispered to me that he would find me one day , beyond death , and give his heart to me . Then he died . My husband cursed everyone , me as well , saying they would be miserable as long as we lived , because we had witnessed his shame . Soon afterwards I poisoned him with murine eye-drops I got from the soldiers , I put them in his wine . He died , clutching his belly . I found out I was pregnant and came to Canada on a boat . ( Silence. ) p. 49 DAVE It 's like that classic episode where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very beautiful story , Grandma . ANNA I think it 's barbaric . DOUG Barbaric and beautiful . . . Dave , do you remember when we used to go to the mall ? DAVE Yeah . That was passion . That was life . DOUG Eaton 's on one side , Simpsons on the other , and all the other stores nestled in between . DAVE Remember that girl we used to see , at the fountain beside Dalmy 's ? DOUG Sure . DAVE That gorgeous green hair . . . those enchanting little spikes all over her head . . . DOUG Should have video-taped her . DAVE Should have talked to her . ANNA Grandma , it was very nice and all that , but why did you tell us that story ? GRANDMA You 'll see . ANNA And why did you come here ? GRANDMA You 'll see . p. 50 ANNA And why did you want me to do a seven-day bloody vigil with you in the first place ? DAVE You 'll see . GRANDMA Thank you . DOUG Is the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you smell something different ? Something like . . . rotting eggs ? Do you think the formaldehyde has to be changed daily or something ? Do you think that thing is actually rotting here in the living room ? DAVE Possibly . ANNA Then we have to take it back . We ca n't take back a dead heart . . . or a heart that is n't . . . intact , or more shrivelled than it was before or . . . Christ ! DAVE The heart is dying . ANNA It 's dead ! It 's already dead ! DOUG The word we 're looking for is " preserved . " DAVE It needs to keep preserved so future generations can learn . GRANDMA Do n't go to pieces . I got a recipe . Anna , go get vinegar and lemon and salt , also a big bowl . David , take this away . Douglas , make tea , Earl Grey . Hot . And bring cloves and garlic ! ( They obediently run to and fro from the kitchen. ) p. 51 DAVE Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chest-a-bloody-bowl stuff ? DOUG Yeah . DAVE Remember that time they put that twenty-foot high statue of Michelangelo 's David in the mall outside Canadian Tire ? ANNA Vinegar , lemon juice . . . I ca n't believe this . DOUG Sugar , salt . . . Yeah , and he was completely naked and his testicles lined up with the lingerie section on the second floor . My mum burst into tears when she first saw him , I wonder why she . . . ANNA Are you sure about the cloves ? GRANDMA Use the cloves . DOUG And then they got a petition together saying it was obscene and they finally carted it away ? It was kind of a religious experience , walking by with your dad carrying a bag of spark plugs and seeing David 's big marble bum . DAVE More lemon . ANNA How do you know ? DAVE I 'm doing it by feel . DOUG How are we going to do it ? Pour the old stuff out down the sink ? But how do you make sure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could hold it with one hand , and then pour but that would mean . . . p. 52 ANNA Touching it . Yeah . One of us may have to touch it . DOUG Who ? DAVE ( To DOUG . ) Captain , I think . . . DOUG No . DAVE ( To ANNA . ) Counsellor . . . ANNA No way . You . DOUG We could take the old formaldehyde out with a spoon . DAVE Yes sir . ( He begins spooning out the old formaldehyde . The others watch . ) DAVE Remember when we were going to just get a camera and shoot stuff , eh Doug , remember ? DOUG Yeah . DAVE We did n't get the grants . DOUG We tried to go for the big time too quick . DOUG We thought there was a big time . DAVE Remember the epileptic sex thing ? When we shot that guy cutting himself with razor blades in the bathtub ? Who were we then ? ANNA Wieners . ( A knock on the door . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep going ! Faster , faster , there 's no time to waste . DAVE You take a turn . ( DOUG spoons in silence for a while . ) DOUG Yeah . . . DAVE It 's so hard , life , you know ? I ca n't figure out why everybody does n't off themselves . DOUG People are starving and being tortured . I ca n't take it anymore , that 's the truth . DAVE Religion , drugs , booze , sex , television . . . I mean nobody does life straight , they all have something to dull the pain . GRANDMA The bleeding heart , cut from a living man 's chest ! That 's life ! Life ! The land under your feet ! Your mother 's tit in your mouth ! Take it ! Love it ! Fuck it ! Cry and weep and scream and love ! DAVE Yeah , well , that 's okay for your generation . ANNA I 've got to get out of here . DAVE You ca n't go . ANNA I ca n't go ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would happen ? p. 54 DAVE To the heart . ANNA I 'm out of here . ( DAVE throws himself in front of the door . DOUG also blocks the way . GRANDMA takes up the task of spooning out the formaldehyde . ) DAVE You ca n't do it . I wo n't let you . ANNA Get out of the way . DOUG Think about it , Counsellor , what if it disturbs the frequencies ? ANNA There is a dead hunk of meat , preserved in Earl Grey tea . It does n't know I 'm leaving . DAVE It 's cured people . Leave your helmet at the door . ANNA Stop that ! I grew up with that . There are no miracles . ( They step aside . ANNA exits . ) DOUG How about that ? She really left . DAVE I did n't think she 'd do it . DOUG Do you think she 's coming back ? GRANDMA Of course she 's coming back . She was always like that , even when she was a little baby . DAVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like all of a sudden we 'll be able to speak French with no work at all ? p. 55 GRANDMA Time to pour in the recipe . DAVE Oh , God , look at it just sitting there by itself . It 's a fish and ca n't live without fluid . Get it in quick . ( They pour in Grandma 's mixture . ) Smells good . Remember when Anna used to give us her film scripts and we used to laugh at her ? DOUG Funny , I was just thinking about that . DAVE They were n't so bad . DOUG A little earthbound . DAVE A little unimaginative DOUG But not so bad . DAVE Not so bad . GRANDMA It 's getting to be time . DAVE You talk just like a wise admiral of the Federation . How old are you ? GRANDMA Nineteen . DOUG But really . GRANDMA Nineteen . ( A knock on the door , louder this time . DAVE and DOUG freeze . ) DAVE It 's the cops . DOUG Number One , you have the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DOUG Suddenly I think , " Why not ? Yes Doug , why not ? " ( Knocking again . ) DOUG Yes , I 'm ready to go . With a light in my eyes and a song in my heart . Yes , I did it , and I do n't care . It was a lark . A couple of fun guys bombing around with the brewskies . . . DAVE Captain , the variables may be too various for a face to face meeting . ( More knocking . ) DOUG Will , I must face the challenge , and face it alone . DAVE Captain ? ( DOUG turns . ) Good luck . ( He opens the door . We hear murmurs and his answers . ) What ? . . . No . . . No . It 's not here . . . Are you with the police ? Then what do you . . . how did you find ou  --  No . I do n't care . Go away . ( He shuts the door and returns to find himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , in some lights , you could be nineteen . Like I can see all ages in your face . I can see fifty . . .

DOUG It was somebody upstairs who wanted to see the heart . DAVE Were you very beautiful ? GRANDMA No . But I always had something they could n't figure out . That 's the best way , then it does n't confuse your brains . You want to be beautiful , but you 're not and the men still want you . Better that way . DOUG It was somebody upstairs who wanted to see the heart ! ! DAVE Did you ask them in ? DOUG No , I did n't ask them in ! How did they know ? Will they tell the police ? Of course they will .

DOUG Dead . It was just a brief flourish , now all belief is gone . There 's been a conspiracy , a kidnapping worse than any experience with the Borg . My brain is dead . I 'm too old . DAVE Give it a rest , Doug . p. 58 DOUG I 've done nothing but give it a rest . I rested so much , I died . I was so saintly , I lived in my bare little room , only watching the box . I let all desire , all ambition leave me . DAVE You desired to see you know what , that 's for sure . DOUG Shut up Dave , I 'm having a moment !

( Weaving a spell . ) A young girl , slim and lithe , with a tiny waist and big eyes that just listens . DOUG Yeah . . . that would be nice . GRANDMA She asks nothing , wants nothing . When you go out , she does n't even want you to come back . When you come back , she wants you to come back . She 's always ready to make love with you . . . p. 59 DOUG Yeah . . .

ANNA Tall , muscular and blond , her full breasts swinging firmly , she is hunter and healer : mixing potions , slaying woolly mammoths . She tames wild animals , cooks prehistoric haute cuisine , fashions amulets . She 's always hung with pouches . Inexplicably torn out of the late Pleistocene Age , she walks the city 's twentieth-century streets . Crisis . Doom is everywhere . Squad cars with megaphones shriek with noise . The sky is heavy . There 's no way out . DOUG I 've never seen anything like it before . DAVE Captain , I . . . ANNA Probably a door-to-door search soon . We 're going to hang for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spear , a spear that she fashioned with her perfectly hung mate , Jondular .

DOUG I never thought she had it in her . ANNA Ayla is capable of bringing down a medium-sized mountain cat . She skins the cat , hides the meat , taking only the heart back to the clan as proof that she is " Woman who Hunts . " DAVE Since you 've been out hunting , did you by any chance get some . . . DOUG Milk ? ANNA Prepare yourselves . The corner store has closed . Boarded up . DOUG We 're going to take the heart back . ANNA When ? DAVE How ? DOUG Soon . ANNA And not get caught ?
