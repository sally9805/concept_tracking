<p> ' I WANT you to hear something , " says Cameron Mackintosh , producer and co-progenitor of such international mega-musicals as " Cats , " " Les Miserables " and " Phantom of the Opera , " as he jumps up from the sofa in his New York office . His whole being ignites with the sudden excitement and energy of a teenager . He darts down the hall , leaving me in the dust . A few moments later I find him putting on a music cassette . In an instant the room is filled with wondrously rich and exquisitely evocative sounds . <p> We are listening to a yet-to-be-released lush symphonic suite , devised by London 's Royal Philharmonic , of the British impresario 's newest extravaganza , " Miss Saigon . " I glance at the man who is undisputedly the world 's most successful stage producer ever . His head is bobbing up and down to the beat . His expression is sheer bliss . This is a man in love . <p> That just about sums up Mr. Mackintosh . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he 's completely uninhibited about showing it . His cherubic face breaks into laughter at the least drop of a quip . This , added to his casual style - athletic shoes , jeans , and loose-fitting shirt are standard threads - make him an oddity in the world of high finance and high-powered success . But it also points to one of the key reasons why he got there . No need for ' trappings ' " Cameron can be a very , very tough producer , " observes composer Claude-Michel Sch154nberg , who , with partner Alain Boublil , created " Les Miserables " and " Miss Saigon . " " And then an hour later , during a lunch or dinner with you , he can be 15 years old - and boyish . After all his huge success , he is still natural and fresh . " <p> Martin McCallum , a close associate of Mackintosh 's since the producer 's debt-ridden days little more than 10 years ago , offers further insights . " Cameron is not somebody who is interested in the trappings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just very genuine . And few at his level of success find it quite as easy as he does to hang on to that . But that 's because he has a very good sense of himself : He knows who he is and does n't believe all the publicity . That 's possibly the most disarming thing about him . " <p> We are meeting only a few days before the much-anticipated New York opening of " Miss Saigon . " But the producer is far less concerned about the critics and the widely reported protests that have been dogging the show than might be expected . The demonstrators outside New York 's Broadway Theater where " Miss Saigon " is mounted are strident , but small in number . They say the show is dealing in negative Asian stereotypes . Mackintosh maintains that if they see it , they will know their protest is ill-founded . Battle with Actors ' Equity The producer also believes that the earlier , much-publicized battle between himself and the leaders of the actors ' union , Equity , who tried to block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eurasian pimp was misguided . The Equity leaders , unlike their British counterparts , argues Mackintosh , " do not have their finger on the pulse of living theater - this was patently obvious in the arbitration - and do not understand in any way just how difficult it is to get a creative team to agree on a single person for casting . " He says that his position was vindicated by the support of the rank-and-file members of Equity . <p> And rumors , of course , abound . That , for example , the lyrics have been hastily altered to make the story ( set during the Vietnam War ) less " anti-American . " Having seen both London and New York productions : They have n't , and it is n't . Equally , Mackintosh has been accused of being the master of hype and musical " formula , " which together he is manipulating solely to achieve another blockbuster . <p> " It 's complete rubbish , " he says . " If you examine the hype by the press ... they are in fact creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula , ' I never actually look for a formula at all . None of my ( biggest hits ) ... have been sure bets , by any means . If there is one thing that connects these shows that I have stumbled on , it 's that the subject matter is universal and crosses every language barrier . " <p> Mackintosh concedes , however , that there is one ingredient he does require from a musical : emotion . But given the general seriousness of his productions , that does n't necessarily mean the five-hanky variety . " I just want to feel that I 've been taken on some kind of exhilarating emotional journey , " he explains . " Whether that 's to fall about with laughter or to cry or to just tap one 's feet , I do n't care . But I do n't want to go into a theater and feel the same when I come out . " <p> But if there is an identifiable leitmotif running through Mackintosh 's extraordinary stage hits , it surely lies within the man himself . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unerring belief in his own instincts . Added to this , he is considered as creative as any writer/lyricist or composer when it comes to pinpointing artistic problems in a musical . He 's very much the persnickety hands-on producer who deeply involves himself with every department , something that is unique in the business . But , most of all , when he gets up in the morning , he does n't " go to work " : he has fun . " Cameron is the sort of person who , ultimately , as we all should be , is happy doing something that is good and excites him , " observes a close friend and colleague . " It 's not simply for a goal at the end , but to enjoy the process along the way . The fact that what he does is successful , as well , quite frankly , is just a byproduct . " <p> Mackintosh , is now ranked among the richest people in Britain . His productions , more than 40 worldwide at the moment , are estimated to take in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work again in his life if he so chose . But judging from the outer office bustle just beyond his door and his own unflagging enthusiasm for what he does , one would never suspect that is the case . <p> " I still do n't quite believe it all , " he muses about his career . " In fact , I only half believe it . It 's almost like it has happened to someone else . " The only appreciable advantage he had was knowing exactly what he wanted to do , " so there was never any choice . " <p> It all began , he recalls , when , at age eight , he was dragged by his family to see his first musical , " Salad Days , " in 1954 . He was certain , with such a preponderance of singing and dancing , that it would be boring stuff . <p> It was n't . He was smitten . The young Mackintosh insisted on returning for another performance and , determinedly , with the aid of his mother and aunt , afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slade . Rather than being patted on the head and otherwise patronized , Mackintosh says that Slade treated him with the utmost seriousness , pointing out all the mechanics and scenery machinations that went into making the show . By the end of the tour he had decided that when he grew up , he was going to make musicals . By 19 , Mackintosh was a full-fledged producer . <p> Mackintosh smiles now as he reflects on the early days when , for example , before comprehensive computerization , he and a partner had several bank accounts around the country , which meant it took at least three weeks for a check , drawn from one to the other , to finally clear . " It was what we called ' putting a check on the road , ' " he chuckles mischievously . <p> Another ploy to keep afloat was to ask actors if they would accept , in lieu of vacation pay , say , their suit from the show or " How about a nice set of Wedgewood pottery ? " ' Cats ' changed everything Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight his life changed . Only 34 years old at the time , but with already more than 100 shows under his belt - some successes , others abysmal flops - Mackintosh 's colleagues had thought he was mad to try to mount a far-from-the-mainstream musical centered around a work by the high-brow poet , T. S. Eliot . What was worse , it was little more visually than a back-alley scene populated by anthropomorphic felines . Still , he took the gamble , using the only rule of thumb he has gone by when deciding to back a show , both before and since : a palpable excitement , somewhere in the pit of his stomach , upon first hearing the score . <p> If Mackintosh does n't get that , no matter what else an idea has going for it , forget it . " In the end I put a show on for myself , " he says , " then just hope an audience will like it ... If I can tell they are getting the same rush from what I am delivering , which I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the greatest feeling in the world . That , in a nutshell , is why I 'm in the musical theater. "
