Section : Cover Story <p> Ah , to have $1,000 in your pocket ! Whether the money arrived as a tax refund or graduation gift , or whether you scraped it together simply by saving , a cool thou has a way of turning a dull world into a dazzle of possibilities . How about a week in Bermuda ? A new stereo ? Are n't there some gaps in your wardrobe that need to be filled ? <p> Maybe , but then you would n't be reading this if your sense of responsibility had n't already prevailed over temptation . You want to invest the money , but where ? <p> It 's not an easy question . Minimum-investment requirements freeze you out of Treasury bills , limited partnerships , municipal bonds , even some bank accounts . With just a grand on hand , you may find that cold-calling brokers hang up on you . True , a thousand dollars could buy you a handful of stocks , but commissions on such small orders could easily devour up to 20% of your stake . <p> Fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passbook savings account : invest in a mutual fund . Buying shares in a fund makes you part owner of a multimillion-dollar portfolio of stocks and bonds . The benefits  --  diversification , instant liquidity and professional investment management  --  are equally valuable whether you are investing your first thousand or adding to an existing stash . " With mutual funds , your $1,000 can be managed just as effectively as a billion-dollar portfolio , " says Jonathan Pond , editor of the Wiesenberger Mutual Funds Investment Report ( 210 South St. , Boston , Mass. 02111 ; $110 a year ) . <p> Some 1,200 come-as-you-are funds will let you in for $1,000 or less . The majority are load funds , which are sold by brokers who skim off initial sales charges , or loads , of as much as 8.5% . No-load funds  --  those sold by fund sponsors directly to investors without sales charges  --  are the more economical investment , of course . But recently some of the major no-load groups have not exactly been eager for your business . T. Rowe Price , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from $1,000 a year ago , and Vanguard has required an initial $3,000 for most of its funds since early last year . In defense of higher minimums , fund sponsors point out that it costs as much to service a $1,000 account as a $100,000 one . As a consequence , having many small shareholders tends to drive up expenses for everyone . <p> Not all no-load groups have abandoned the little guy . The no-load Financial Programs group in Denver , for example , accepts initial investments of as little as $250 . That allowed William Halko , 54 , a farmer outside Great Falls , Mont. , to split his $750 in savings among three Financial funds : Industrial Income , Strategic Utilities and Strategic Health Sciences . " I do n't have a real big income , but I want to start putting away something for my future , " says Halko . " These funds let me get under way for a bare-bones minimum . " <p> Financial Programs is one of 17 sponsors represented among the 25 outstanding low-minimum funds listed in the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most feature modest annual operating expenses of under 1% . ( The major exceptions tend to be overseas funds , in which the higher costs of doing business abroad drive up the expense ratio . ) And while all of our stalwarts welcome starting investments of $1,000 or less , they concede nothing in performance to their more exclusive competitors . Included in our top 25 , in fact , are two of the six funds nominated in last month 's MONEY cover story as the 1990s ' most promising growth-stock funds : Scudder Global and SteinRoe Special . Note that all the performance figures cited in this article are for the 12 months to July 1 . For long-term returns and fund phone numbers , refer to the table on page 70 . <p> STARTING OUT BY PLAYING IT SAFE If this is your first foray into securities , think of your $1,000 as a foundation for the money you will add regularly from now on . An excellent starting point is a total-return fund , a type that seeks steady returns by investing for both capital gains and income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many analysts warning that earnings disappointments could trip up market darlings . <p> The total-return approach reaches probably its fullest expression in the fairly new category called asset-allocation funds , which invest in a number of different kinds of assets . The leading no-load entry , USAA Cornerstone , up 6.7% in the past 12 months , divides its holdings among domestic and foreign stocks , U.S. bonds , and real estate and gold stocks . Such broad diversification ensures that at least part of the portfolio will grow in almost any economic environment . <p> More conventional total-return funds tend to lean more toward one side or the other of the total-return equation . The most conservative aim to produce yields half a percentage point or more above that of the average stock , currently 3.4% . Among such funds , James Stack , editor of the InvesTech Mutual Fund Advisor newsletter ( 2472 Birch Glen , Whitefish , Mont . 59937 ; $165 a year ) , favors Financial Industrial Income , up 21.1% . One of the funds chosen by farmer Halko , Industrial Income maintains its yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional and convertible bonds . Other total-return choices lean toward capital appreciation by investing almost entirely in equities and relying on the stocks ' dividends to supply the fund 's income . Two such : Founders Blue Chip , up 19.7% , which concentrates on the stocks of proven , financially solid corporations ; and Safeco Equity , up 17.8% , which mixes high-dividend equities , such as utilities , with lower-yielding growth stocks . <p> Other variants on the total-return approach are balanced funds , which split your money in a more or less fixed percentage between stocks and bonds . Jonathan Pond likes CGM Mutual , up 14.4% , which goes all out for big gains on the stock side of its portfolio but always keeps at least 20% of its money in bonds or cash . A steadier but less spectacular performer is Vanguard Star , up 5.6% , which spreads its money among seven of Vanguard 's other equity and fixed-income funds . <p> Normally , you would expect the fund with the greatest exposure to equities to turn in the best performance over periods of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond funds sometimes outrun stock funds  --  and today 's sluggish economy may well herald one of those periods . Continued economic weakness would crimp stock market performance and drive down interest rates , giving bond fund investors a capital-gains kicker on top of their yield . <p> In a weak economy , however , you need to be careful of the credit quality of your fund 's bonds . The surest precaution is to put : your money into government bond funds . All the issues in such portfolios enjoy the backing of the U.S. Government , the most secure credit in the world . Worthy possibilities include Benham GNMA Income , up 8.4% , which holds government-guaranteed mortgages , and WPG Government Securities , up 7.7% , which owns mortgages and Treasuries with an average maturity of 15 years . If you can accept moderate credit risk , you can earn higher yields with high-quality corporate bonds . Two choices : Columbia Fixed Income , up 7.2% , and Babson Bond Trust  --  Long-Term Portfolio , up 6.4% , which hold a mixture of corporate and government bonds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates fall , as many experts predict , long-term funds like these will pop  --  but they will also fizzle fast if rates rise instead . As a hedge , you can invest in a short-term bond fund , like Scudder Short-Term Bond , up 9.1% . The high-grade corporate bonds in its portfolio have an average maturity of only 2.7 years , making the fund 's returns about 40% more stable than those of the typical long-term bond fund . <p> Investors in the 28% or higher federal tax bracket ( taxable income of $32,450 for married couples and $19,450 for singles ) should also consider municipal bond funds . Tax-exempt funds pay 33%-bracket investors ( couples earning over $78,400 and singles over $47,050 ) an average of 6.9% , compared with after-tax yields of 6.1% on comparable taxable funds . If Congress hikes the top bracket to a flat 33%  --  as seems increasingly possible  --  such yields would be available to even more taxpayers . Investment advisers recommend Safeco Muni , yielding 6.8% , SteinRoe Managed Municipals , paying 6.7% , or Financial Tax-Free Income , yielding 6.7% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already established a conservative core portfolio and are investing your next $1,000 , you may be ready to take bigger risks to achieve higher returns . Though any near-term advance from the market 's current elevated levels is far from assured , over the long run you can expect stocks to outperform bonds . So if you can afford to hold on to your investment for at least five to 10 years , you should be rewarded for taking a flier on a top-performing growth-stock fund . <p> Among the most conservative of this group is Mathers , up 10.5% , which is currently hunkered down with 87% of its portfolio in cash . Another fund that prefers to sit on the sidelines during uncertain periods is Janus Fund , up 23.5% . From around 40% in cash as recently as January , however , Janus is now down to a relatively aggressive 9.3% cash position . <p> One drawback to the two funds , however , is that by zigzagging back and forth between cash and stocks they may zig out of the market just before equities unexpectedly take off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rising market ( at the risk of suffering all the losses as well ) , Seattle financial planner Dorothy Lewis suggests Twentieth Century Select , up 25.5% . Select remains fully invested in good times and bad in dividend-paying stocks with accelerating earnings growth . Columbia Growth , up 17.1% , also generally remains fully invested and tends to choose its stocks by first identifying promising industrial sectors . Current favorites : technology and retail stocks . SteinRoe Special , up 21.2% , takes the opposite approach , ignoring industries and focusing instead on individual growth companies overlooked by the market . <p> To crank up the risk a notch higher , consider an aggressive growth fund . Ken Weber , editor of Webers ' Fund Advisor ( P.O. Box 3490 , New Hyde Park , N.Y . 11040 ; $95 a year ) , likes Twentieth Century Growth , up 25.8% , which invests purely for appreciation , without regard to dividends . <p> Small stocks have lagged blue chips for most of the 1980s , but according to Ibbotson Associates of Chicago , little companies have still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of more than two percentage points a year . Many analysts are convinced that small stocks will break out once more before the current economic expansion is over . Two excellent small-company funds are Janus Venture , up 21.6% , and Nicholas II , up 8.3% . <p> If you already have at least $4,000 tucked away in domestic stock funds , consider investing your next thousand abroad . Over the past five years , the average foreign-stock fund has outperformed the average U.S. fund 205% to 87% . But there are risks : internationals must contend not only with markets that can be more volatile than ours but also with currency fluctuations . " If you 're concerned about safety , choose a fund that holds both U.S. and foreign stocks , " says Thurman Smith , editor of Equity Fund Outlook ( P. O. Box 1040 , Boston , Mass. 02117 ; $95 a year ) . His pick : Scudder Global , up 20% , which currently has 29% of its money in the U.S. and 55% in Europe . <p> Over the long term , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even stronger gains because Europe and many small emerging economies figure to grow faster than the U.S. Smith likes Ivy International , up 21.6% , which currently favors the U.K. market ; and Scudder International , up 25.9% , which has supplemented a large position in established Continental European stocks with Indian and Thai securities . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : In February , Montana farmer William Halko put $250 each into three low-minimum funds run by the Financial Programs group . " Out here it is n't easy to keep up with individual stocks , " he says . " Funds take a lot of that worry off your mind . " MAD MONEY <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : If mutual funds do n't make you dance , put a little rhythm in your portfolio with collectible records . Best bet : 45 rpm 's recorded by little-known all-male black harmony groups of the 1950s , such as the Vibranaires and the Larks , on labels like Harlem or Chance . Generally only a few thousand copies were pressed , making mint-condition disks extremely rare . A grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to double in value in five years . <p> by Penelope Wang <p> 25 GREATS YOU CAN BUY FOR A GRAND <p> Whether you are investing your first $1,000 or rounding out your portfolio , these low-minimum mutual funds should serve you well . All offer strong track records and moderate expenses , including no initial sales charge . The high cash positions at funds such as Mathers and Janus Venture reflect their managers ' caution toward the stock market at its current levels . TABLE <p>
