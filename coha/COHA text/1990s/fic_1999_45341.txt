Inspiration <p> I pulled the plastic wrapper off my new cassette tape and proceeded to listen to some of the most inspiring music I had heard in a long time . The compositions were not new . You might even call them ancient . A soprano duet sang high , clear , simple melodies from France , Germany , England , and the Americas . Then I heard " Ancient Mother " -a melody so pure and full of melancholy-strummed out in notes that filled my room . Then the vocal entered : <p> Ancient Mother , I hear you calling . <p> Ancient Mother , I hear your song . <p> Ancient Mother , I hear your laughter . <p> Ancient Mother , I taste your tears.1 <p> I played the song over and over , wondering what it was in the simple melody that could move me in such a powerful manner . I thought , " I have to choreograph a dance to this song . " <p> The idea of an ancient mother had been alive in my mind ever since I was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women in a matriline are owners of the family name and of property , both of which are passed down from one generation to the next . With ownership comes the power to make decisions within the family , the clan , and the tribe . I believe that this is why the women in my lineage are strong : They know they have the power to make things happen . My grandmother , for example , ruled her family with an iron hand . Once when my cousin , who was a minor at the time , tried to leave the town of Sitka , located on Boronoff Island , my grandmother stopped her by throwing her in jail . My mother , too , is an example of strength . At sixty-three she has a job in public relations and keeps a schedule that even a twenty year old could n't keep up with . In " Ancient Mother " I heard my maternal ancestors singing , laughing , calling , and crying . <p> The song " Ancient Mother " came to me at an unsettled period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Phoenix , Arizona , to Reno , Nevada , because of changes at his office . With this move , I would be separated from my only child for the first time . My daughter was married the spring before we moved to Reno . In addition to leaving my daughter and son-in-law , I was also leaving behind my community of dancers . I had started Thursday in the Dark Dance Theatre , a sacred dance group , the year that I graduated with a bachelor 's degree in dance from Arizona State University . I nurtured and directed this company of dancers that had grown from four to fourteen within four years . I left the group in the hands of two codirectors as I moved on to further my training in the field of sacred dance . At the same time I had been accepted into the master 's program in theology in the arts with a focus on dance at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley , California . My attendance meant separation from my husband during the school year . I would stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel the four-hour drive back to Reno in order to visit my husband and my new home . I also began that first semester knowing that within the year I was to become a grandmother . It was a difficult time of transition filled with periods of wonder and excitement over new faces , new friends , and new knowledge . <p> In psychology , times of transition are known as liminal states , as being on a threshold . According to Jean Shinoda Bolen in Crossing to Avalon , being on the threshold is like starting a journey . It is at this point where " the invisible spiritual world and the visible reality come together , " when people become aware of coincidences between their inner and outer worlds.2 At these times the uncanny and timely appearance of an animal or a person can often influence decisions . It is during these times of availability that a person can respond to a call for transformation . The song " Ancient Mother " came to me at such a time , when I was open to new things . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was busy with his new job . I was ready to follow the beautiful , haunting song wherever it was going to lead me . <p> Choreography <p> Before leaving Phoenix I had a chance to experiment with my inspirational music in the studio . I felt that the song called for slow ritual movement but at only two and a half minutes in duration , I could hardly move slowly across the floor without running out of music . The words and the melody brought nothing to my mind that I could wrap my thoughts around ; I could n't find the motivation for the movement . I gave up , deciding to rework the piece another time . <p> Once in Berkeley , that first semester came and went in a flourish of papers and dance . Christmas and quality time with husband , in-laws , and daughter were a fading memory as spring semester started amid the rain of the San Francisco Bay Area . It was the first Wednesday of the spring semester back at the Pacific School of Religion . I had made the decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women and Religion called " The Sacred Body : A Feminist Pedagogy . " <p> I walked into the small house behind the school campus that serves as the Center for Women and Religion . When I walked in women were sitting in a circle around a coffee table in a small living room . Students were making tea in the kitchen , and snacks were set out on the dining-room table . The cofacilitators started the class by introducing themselves and then asked each of the students to introduce herself and share what she expected from the class . <p> The cofacilitators then explained the feminist format of the class . Each class would start with a checking-in time where everyone had a chance to speak . After we performed an opening ritual of some type , the rest of the class was up to the students . The facilitators had put together the basic reading list and come up with the topic for each class , but it would be up to the students to lead the discussions and decide what other activities would occur . Each week a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a final project that would be presented on the last day . As they explained the class I became very excited because I was told that my final project could be a dance . It was my goal to work on sketches of dances for my thesis project in any class that I was given the opportunity . Part of the thesis project was to be movement rituals of purification with water and/or fire . By the end of the first class I had decided that my final project would be a water ritual . <p> I stayed after class to talk to the cofacilitators about my plan . Martha , who is Jewish , was immediately drawn to my idea . She told me about a new movement among Jewish women to reclaim the Mikveh bath , a traditional cleansing ritual done by Jewish women a week after they complete their monthly menses . Blood is considered impure under Jewish law . No Jew is to eat meat that is still tainted with blood , and a man is considered impure if he touches a woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even touch the garments or the utensils of a woman during her menses . Rachel Biale writes in Women and Jewish Law , " The laws of purity were a cornerstone of the ritual practice .... Purity should be understood as a state which permits a person to approach the place of divine presence . " 3 The purpose of the Mikveh bath is to purify women for any public or private contact . This intrigued me . It was obviously a sort of water ritual . I wanted to know more about how and where this ritual was done , and what it was like to feel impure , and if there was a transformation that takes place to make one feel pure again . <p> When I returned to my room I started going through my music . The song " Ancient Mother " seemed perfect for this woman 's bathing ritual ; it renders the thoughts that a woman may have of her own mother or grandmother as she performs this traditional ritual . " I hear you calling " is the thought of a woman as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the woman undresses and sees her own body as the same as the other women 's bodies , she may ruminate , " I hear your song . " As she steps into the water the woman may fancy , " I hear your laughter . " When splashing the water up to her face to wash from her body the impurity of being a woman , she may reflect , " I taste your tears . " <p> In the studio the form of the bathing ritual fell easily into place . Over Christmas break I had seen a dance performed with a tub of water . In conceptualizing my own dance , I imagined there was a tub of water in the middle of the studio floor . I turned on the music and quickly took my place behind and to the right side of the tub . Just standing there I felt like I should be carrying something-a bowl or a jar . With my arms up in front of me as if I were carrying a jar , I walked slowly in a straight path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked quickly in a circle around the tub , and ended the phrase at the head of the tub . It felt perfect . I twisted the top off the imaginary jar , poured its contents into the tub , and then lifted the jar to the sky . I placed the jar on the floor . As the words to " Ancient Mother " began I pretended to pull a gown over my head , as if undressing , and lifted the gown to the heavens , to the right and then to the left . Then I opened my hands and let the gown fall to the floor . With my head against my elbow I turned around myself once as if ashamed of anyone seeing my nakedness . I dropped my hands and stood straight as if to totally expose myself , and stepped , one foot at a time , into the imaginary tub of water . I leaned over and took a handful of water , then turned slowly letting drops fall around the outside of the tub , casting a circle of protection around myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I paddled water up the front of me and into the air and smiled . With the words " I taste your tears , " I squatted into the tub , cupped water in both hands and splashed it on my face . Standing up slowly , I raised my arms in praise . Then I dropped my arms to the side and down , and stepped out of the tub , cleansed . <p> Over the next several weeks I continued to refine the dance . In the studio I worked on the timing . Movements were added and perfected . I acquired a jewel  --  toned blue tub , a Greek-style white gown , and a jar of sea salts . In order to see what I had done , I brought a video camera into the studio and put the dance on tape . I viewed the tape and saw something beautiful . Yet it felt incomplete . The dance was pretty , but it lacked any transformative elements . From all I had read , I knew that for a ritual to be effective it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board . <p> Readings from two of my classes inspired my next steps along my journey of dance-making . In Dance Therapy and Depth Psychology , Joan Chodorow suggests that people seek a community of well-being in both societal attitudes and personal relationships . The search for communal well-being is mirrored in what a society perceives to be " The Beautiful , " " The Holy , " " The True , " and " The Good . " These values , or the ideal of these values , are found in the art , religion , and philosophy of societies . Communal well-being , Chodorow states , is disrupted when one feels rejection in a relationship . This causes embarrassment and dislike that are manifested in shame and contempt . 4 From my reading of Chodorow , it became clear that to make my dance transformative I had to include movements and accompaniment that would express the disruption of communal well-being into disharmony . Finishing the dance with the ritual bath would complete the cycle back to well-being . <p> A short time after I came to this conclusion about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read Andy Smith 's deeply upsetting article " Christian Conquest and the Sexual Colonization of Native Women . " According to Smith , American Indians were seen as " other " by the early colonizers of America , and they were referred to as " dirty beasts , " " savages , " and " devils . " Subjugation of the American Indian was initiated and sustained by a series of events , a primary one being the separation of American Indian families . Beginning in the 1600s , American Indian children were taken from their homes and sent to live , at times for years , in boarding schools , where they often suffered from various forms of abuse , such as rape and molestation , beatings and child labor . Generations of American Indian children were brought up separated from their cultural heritage and from their natural family life . Rampant child abuse on reservations is one of the many repercussions of this separation . Young mothers , Smith argues , have no knowledge of how to raise children ; they were never taught how to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the families they had been separated from for so long.5 <p> Though many people may argue that this situation has changed , Smith disagrees . As late as the early 1990s , he observes , the American Indian culture was still being dishonored . In 1993 , for example , the National Council of Churches organized a Re-Imagining Conference , ostensibly held to honor a nonpatriarchal God . Native women were asked to dance in traditional dress but never invited to speak . The Native women offered medicine bundles , which are sacred objects and are meant to be treated with care ; the attendees of the conference tossed them aside in a disrespectful manner . Thus this display of Native American tradition was simply a feel-good experience for the white women who took part in the conference . Smith explains , " White women still do not honor the right of Native women to heal from the rape of colonization . " This , he continues , has created shame in the American Indian , and contempt in European-based American society.6 Here the concepts discussed by Chodorow were clearly illustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrupted when the non-Native women rejected the Native women . They did this first by not asking them to speak at the conference and then by tossing aside their sacred gifts . The Native women were certainly embarrassed by the non-Native women 's actions and had the right to show them contempt . The rocky relationship between the American Indians and the colonizers of America certainly meet the criteria of Chodorow 's disrupted community . Now , how do we get back to the community of well-being that Chodorow says we all seek ? Is there a way to mend the relationship between American Indians and the non-Native ? <p> I thought of a class that I had taken the previous semester on peace rites . In one particular lesson we were asked to work in pairs , supporting each other in a meditation . My partner and I picked the topic of " mercy " for our meditation . When I closed my eyes and let myself sink into a deep state of meditation , I had a vision of the European invasion of America . I felt the anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " white " consciousness of this generation is ashamed of its history . There is a silence , an unspoken anger and fear , about the Indians in America . I had been filled with compassion for both these peoples ; as a " halfbreed " I had felt the pain of both within me . I came out of that meditation filled with forgiveness and peace . Considering this new dance , I realized that perhaps that vision had been given to me to use . I felt power at being able to be compassionate toward the enemies of my ancestors . Maybe I could draw others into that same compassion and forgiveness for their enemies . <p> Joan Borysenko , in the audiotape Meditations for Forgiveness , says , " The people and circumstances that injured us can turn out to be the transformers through which we find the richness of our humanity . " She continues to say that forgiveness means not letting the other get away with something by turning the other cheek . It requires no amends from the other , and we have no responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer be friends with him or her . Forgiveness allows us freedom from resentment , judgement , and hatred . Borysenko lays out a process of forgiveness in four steps : grieving for what has been lost ; anger about the loss ; acceptance of the loss ; and finding meaning in what has happened . She says , " Difficult circumstances and negative emotions are meant to be the raw material for soul growth . " 7 To find one 's self in a relationship full of shame and hatred is to find one 's self in a situation that offers a possibility of transformation . Seeking the road to a right relationship is not easy , but like the teenage years , it is full of events that forever change the way we perceive life . <p> Here was a controversial and deeply personal topic : social reconciliation . Never before had I even considered making a dance that attempted to make this kind of social statement . The idea that one person could initiate one culture or society to forgive another culture or society for the disruptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was not at all sure I wanted to reveal so much about myself . Though I know that art is supposed to be personal , I had gotten away with doing far less personal dances than the one I was contemplating . To do this water ritual , to make a transformative dance using the Native American culture as the base , would mean the risk of exposing my true self and thus possibly being laughed at . <p> Still , I decided to continue this journey with the " Ancient Mother . " I wanted to create and perform the water ritual dance within the context of my mother 's Tlingit culture . But was ritual bathing even a part of my mother 's culture ? I found my answer in Norman Bancroft-Hunt and Werner Forman 's People of the Totem . Ritual bathing was once a regular part of life of the native people of the Northwest Coast . It was done for healing , good luck , and as a safeguard against meeting with spirits.8 I would like to think that the ritual bathing that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as for well-being . <p> I sat in my room contemplating the additional accompaniment to use to create this dance of forgiveness . Music did not seem to be the right choice ; I needed something to help inspire the movement . Poetry-my own poetry ! I had poems that I had written over the years . Some were in the voices of my ancestors while others were written about my ancestors . " Chinook " is in my great  --  grandmother 's voice . " Shotgun Alley " is about a dual that was fought over my grandmother when she was young . " Red Poppies " demonstrates the influences of patriotism and war on my grandmother and myself . In " My Mother 's Eyes " I tell of my mother 's loss of her husband to cancer . " I Have n't Seen Her in Awhile " is about my perceptions of the repercussions of alcohol . " Untitled " is about hope as I see it today . These poems follow the grieving process as set out by Borysenko . " Shotgun Alley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Eyes " are about grieving for what is lost . " Chinook " and " I Have n't Seen Her in Awhile " demonstrate anger about loss . Finally , the acceptance of loss would be the water ritual performed to the song " Ancient Mother . " The white bud in the poem " Untitled " signifies the understanding of all that has come to pass and a new aliveness to the future . The above chronological order , I decided , was good for this dance . Then I would place " Ancient Mother " right before the poem " Untitled . " <p> I read the poems into my tape recorder , recording the music in the proper spot . Then I was ready to return to the rehearsal studio . <p> After warming up , I marked off the tight space I would be performing in , only about six by eight feet , and placed the tub in the center of the room . I imagined the audience seated on couches all around the walls , with the coffee table set at one end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I started moving . I used the Pueblo step-a step side , step together with a bounce in the knees-to take me to the altar . I went with my back to the imagined audience so that they would see the clan symbols on my dance blanket . This would be the introduction of myself . At the altar , I turned to face the center and continued the Pueblo step , completing a circle . Because I wanted the audience to hear the words of my poems I minimized movement so as not to distract them . As the second poem , " Shotgun Alley , " started I went into a deep knee bend , a male movement . Making sharp poking gestures with my hands I quickly turned , keeping the beat , moving deep and fast . When I was directly in front of an imaginary person seated against the wall , I wobbled my head to and fro , again a man 's gesture . As " Shotgun Alley " drew to a close , I drew up into the women 's sway of sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean , moving forward and backward from the hips . Next came the poem of grieving . I took off my blanket , folded it , and placed it on the altar . I lit a candle as a gesture of remembrance , then I took a rose and walked slowly around the room stripping rose petals and dropping them to the floor . After placing the naked flower on the altar , I proceeded to take off a layer of clothes , and let down my hair . Clothed in a white gown over a white slip , I finished the poetry section . I moved into the bathing ritual as the music for " Ancient Mother " started . As I stepped out of the tub I picked up a white blanket , representing hope for future generations , from the floor . I wrapped the blanket around my shoulders as the poem " Untitled " was read . <p> raking rocks <p> out of <p> the yard <p> a <p> white <p> bud bounces <p> out of <p> the tines <p> I returned to my room and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something out of the corner of my eye : Outside the window a deer was standing and watching me . I walked closer to the window and the deer just stood there . We stared at each other for a long time until she finally walked off , down the hill toward the city . Maybe the deer was there , maybe she was a spirit helper , or maybe she was both . For me the deer represents peace . In the Yaqui culture the deer is surrounded by flowers in a rainbow-colored heavenly place of peace . In the Tlingit culture the Deer Ceremony is another name for the Peace Ceremony that is performed at the closure of a fight between clans . Seeing the deer confirmed my decision to choreograph this dance of forgiveness and peace . <p> Choosing A Title <p> Choosing a title is always difficult . Not only should it have meaning for me , but it should also be understandable to others . For the title of this dance I went back a few years to when I had spent the summer in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my clan from the elder , Daasdiya . Songs and dances belong to clans or families . I was allowed to learn only my own family songs and dances . But an elder of another clan can also give you their songs and dances . Daasdiya is from the Coho clan while I am from the Sea Pigeon clan . She gave me a dance called the " Raven Peace , " which is a peace-making dance . Wars and feuds between clans were common and could last for generations ; insults and wounds of conflict needed healing . The Peace Ceremony , otherwise known as the Deer Ceremony , was a first step in healing community . " Raven Peace " is done in the Peace Ceremonies and is one of the few peace dances that has survived in the Tlingit culture to this day . <p> An English translation of " Raven Peace " is : Raven thinks he looks so pretty . The way he walks around he looks so funny , like me dancing here . Raven thinks he is so cute . The way he rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walks toward his Wolf.9 <p> The soloist in this dance represents the Raven . He/she wears a raven-shaped hat and hops , struts , and rolls his/her eyes at the audience . The Raven is a clown and is trying to make the audience laugh . In the song and dance , Raven is a symbol of the clan singing the song and the Wolf the other clan ; they poke fun at their own arrogance by walking about clumsily as a raven does . At the end of the song , Raven is said to be " walking toward his Wolf . " I chose these words as my title in order for this dance to highlight its peace-making element and its focus on the healing of relationships . The dance is a call for peace and healing to occur between the descendants of the American Indians and those of the many peoples that have settled on this land called America . <p> However , a dance is not done until it is performed before an audience . On the last day of the Sacred Body class I gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Tlingit button blanket and white gown and slip . As I walked to my class with my arms full , I was nervous . What if they did n't like it ? As other students showed their work my mind was racing about my presentation . At break time I went into the bathroom and changed into my two white gowns . Barefoot and shaking with preperformance adrenaline , I stepped into the small living room . As the eleven women returned to their chairs I set up my props and put the tape in the tape deck . I waited for the room to become silent and when I had everyone 's attention I began my introduction . My voice was shaking , but once the tape started I was dancing and my body took control . I moved proud and strong through the dance . Afterward , I sat on the floor to gather feedback and responses from my fellow students . One student said , " Thank you for forgiving me . I always felt ashamed about what my ancestors had done , but I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in agreement . My own tears joined those of the women . A few came forward and wrapped me in their arms . The facilitators said that the piece was very powerful . " Dancing Toward My Wolf " had taken me on a journey-from inspiration to a completed performance art piece , in the shape of a cleansing , healing , and transformative ritual . <p> Final Thoughts <p> It was once thought that the universe abounded with spirits that possessed powers to heal . The early Tlingit perceived omens in the croak of a raven or the presence of a deer . The shaman was the mediator and healer . Gabrielle Roth , a modern shaman , writes in Maps to Ecstasy , " Shamanic healing is a journey . " lo She further delineates five levels of consciousness : inertia , imitation , intuition , imagination , and inspiration . It is at level five , inspiration , that the shaman works . This is a spontaneous , creative , and spiritual level . It is the shaman in me that dares to look into the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to dance toward my Wolf in order to take the journey toward healing the pain found in my ancestral line . Paula Gunn Allen in " Grandmother of the Sun " writes , " There is a spirit that pervades everything , that is capable of powerful song and radiant movement . " The spirit has many colors and at its center is " Woman . " It is what creates balance and harmony in relationships , and " to her we owe our very breath . " " I send these words as a prayer to the Grandmother Spirit . I give this dance in peace as I dance toward my Wolf . <p> Shotgun Alley I <p> a shoot out <p> the turn of the century <p> two men over a woman <p> black and copper , guns <p> and bullets go <p> go to the islands <p> along the northern shore <p> gone to Shotgun Alley <p> to a beach where crabs stand watch <p> and sea pigeons cry , soundless <p> into the morning light <p> two shots ring out , run sideways <p> cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> claws clicking in the silence <p> men 's eyes stare vacant at the blood <p> colored haze of sunrise in the old west <p> guns smoldering on the beach <p> the copper-skinned women sway <p> ear loops fall loose <p> at their breasts they sway <p> back and forth to ease the pain <p> back and forth to put away the sorrow <p> the young widow sits <p> as the old women watch , the son <p> wraps his small hand in his mother 's hair <p> Raven calls through the trees <p> The Red Poppies Wave <p> I turn the wheel and follow the afternoon light across the pavement .
