<p> Is the recession ending ? Seers eagerly watch the consumer confidence index , upticks in the gross domestic product or pronouncements from the Federal Reserve for clues . <p> Try the caviar index . Sales of Beluga , which connoisseurs consider pearls for the palate , have risen 12 to 15 percent since the year-end holidays , according to Dro Proudian , managing director of Petrossian Inc. , the international purveyor of fish eggs and other fine victuals . That 's way ahead of the Dow Jones average . <p> Proudian slips into financial jargon as he talks on about the rate of growth in his restaurants in New York . The lunch trade is up there , he explains , due to a " rationale perceived as being good value . People want to maximize luxury during a recession . " Translated , it means you get more for the buck at his place . In the past year the price of his caviar has dropped 21 percent , from $ 75 to $ 59 per ounce . <p> If truth be told  --  and Proudian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the mating habits of the sturgeon and fish market forces in the Caspian than recession in the USA . <p> Call it coincidence . Two glossy magazines catering to the stylish featured caviar in this month 's issues . Elle Decor , the bible of French-connected chic , piled hedgerows of ( cheaper red ) caviar on its pages to delineate items from a collection of imperial Russian and other aristocratic china . The editors of Gourmet chose caviar and blinis ( demystified by the American translation , pancakes ) as the pie'ce de re'sistance for a new column entitled " Forbidden Pleasures . " " Anyone who has ever been on a diet knows that favorite foods can be forbidden for just so long , and that a major gorge is the inevitable result , " wrote editor-in-chief Gail Zweigenthal . <p> Is that symbol of ' 80s lavish entertaining staging a comeback ? Are recession-weary Washingtonians building up to a major gorge , even a petite gorge ? Caterers , florists , party planners , society mavens and prominent people are no different from economists when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . <p> The unlikely dinner party of eight shown on this Washington Home cover  --  Redskin Darrell Green , " Today 's " Katie Couric , impresario Martin Feinstein , Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan , commentator Martin Agronsky , columnist Diana McLellan , actress Kitty Carlisle Hart and publisher William Regardie  --  was drawn from the list of prominent people who are lending their names to an annual charity benefit called " Entertaining People . " The event , which raises money for the Washington Home nursing home and hospice , features room vignettes created by interior designers that are loosely based on how various Washington personalities entertain at home . ( The vignettes are on display at the Mayflower Hotel through the weekend . ) <p> The celebrities provided a starting point for a sampling of attitudes about recessionary entertaining . Professional party makers added their own views . Only a handful indicated the social barometer was turning toward " fair . " A few felt the needle was still on " stormy , " but the vast majority pointed to " unchanged . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outspoken : " We 've heard a lot from Washington 's wealthy women that they are sick of the recession , that they want to go on with their lives , want to go back to the good times , " he said . " They are sick of pinching pennies . Their buying habits have n't changed , but they are beginning to chafe about the atmosphere . The tide has definitely turned . " Bell took care to point out that his clientele represents old money and therefore has been scarcely affected by the recession . " My prices are up . People want elegant but not showy arrangements . They do n't want their friends to know they are spending money . " <p> Interior designer David Mitchell declared , " People are tired of the recession . Their attitude is changing . ' We work hard , ' they say , ' and this is what we want . ' They do n't want to be influenced by other people or the media . You ca n't do anything without being criticized for it today . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urging Americans to spend more to help end the recession . In November he observed it was a " good time to buy a home or a car . " In his State of the Union speech last month he urged citizens to put some of the $ 25 billion in his proposed tax withholding changes back into the economy to help pay for clothing , college or a car . He did n't say anything about caviar or haute cuisine . <p> Leah Spencer , owner of the Wisconsin Avenue catering establishment Fete Accomplie , who describes her clients as upper-middle-class residents of Northwest Washington , reported good January sales . " Catering-wise , people are starting to spend money again . We recently did a birthday party under a heated tent with French service . We would n't have seen that last year . " <p> During the depths of the recession , Spencer said , these same people would have a housekeeper or friend help with a dinner party ; only the entree would be catered . " People are still concerned about the economy , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  chicken is seen as cheap again  --  but entering slowly into full service . They are not back to caviar and champagne , but something that looks elegant and is not that expensive . " <p> Bethesda party planner Rita Bloom talked of her well-heeled clients . " At the beginning of the recession , they asked themselves if they were going to survive . At this point they 've decided they 're going to make it , so they want to celebrate in a modest way . " Corporate entertaining is down , with parties being planned much closer to the event , she said . As for individuals , " I still see a hesitancy to go overboard in the way people did in the ' 80s . They paid their dues to peer pressure to spend . Now they 're happy to have an excuse not to get carried away . Even well-off clients are more sensitive to the difficulties of people around them , " she added . <p> Ah , the " S " word . In one conversation after another , those questioned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the word vulgar , as in , " It would be vulgar to entertain in an ' 80s fashion in the ' 90s . " <p> All Tuxed Out Sharon Agronsky , who with her husband retired television commentator Martin Agronsky , is among the 17 individuals or couples whose private lives are suggested in the " Entertaining People " vignettes , echoed the sentiments of many Washingtonians queried . She said , " Things are scaled down  --  there 's not so much money or so much grandeur . You do n't want to participate in ostentation ; you do n't want to give the appearance of being vulgar . Times have really changed . I wonder if it is n't part of the cultural aging of America away from a life of acquisition and showing off . Besides , I like being able to keep some money aside . " <p> Another participant , magazine publisher William Regardie , said he and his wife , Renee , attend far fewer charity functions these days  --  " I have n't had a tux on once since September . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , claims there are just as many as ever this year . <p> In a concession to the recession , the organizers of " Entertaining People " decided to eliminate one lunch event and combine what were previously two nights ' activities into one . By creating a two-tier event , an $ 85-per-head cocktail buffet for the 25-to-35 age bracket and a separate , $ 200-per-person preview dinner , " We hope to get more people to attend , " said chairman Jane Sloat . <p> This year 's theme is " A Whimsical Dinner at Eight . " The best-known version of it was the Broadway production " Dinner at Eight , " George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber 's 1932 comedy about the spats of wealthy social climbers who clamor for invitations to a dinner for British nobility . The 1933 movie starred big-screen greats John and Lionel Barrymore , Jean Harlow , Billie Burke and Wallace Beery . <p> But Washington is not interested in social climbing anymore , according to Susan Watters , writing in W , a Fairchild publication that covers the trust fund crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington dinner party dead . " People still talk about who killed it  --  the excesses of the ' 80s , the current depressed economy , George and Barbara Bush and their Anti-Socialite Temperance League , " wrote Watters . " The Bush team does n't social climb , " she continued . " It knows they do n't need to and has very little time for anybody who does . " The latest word from Watters on dinner parties : still dead . <p> Veteran society columnist Diana McLellan , now with Washingtonian magazine , who claims she 's the meatloaf type at home , said the striped pants set is " way down on lobster and filet , way up on meatballs . " As for official Washington , " It 's like the Eisenhower administration , before the Kennedys glamorized government parties . And people are relieved . " <p> With respect to corporate entertaining , Barbara Boggs , of Washington Inc. , said the $ 125 ( per plate ) dinner has now become the $ 85 dinner . " We 're doing a lot of late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : apple pie , casseroles , potato things . It 's declasse to have things too fancy . " <p> At home , scaled back , informal , relaxed , " healthy " foods , with a sprinkling of sensitivity , are the entertainment buzzwords of the ' 90s , according to those interviewed . For instance , at their home in Atlanta , where the kitchen and great room are divided only by a counter , Ginger and Louis W. Sullivan make the caterer a part of the party for their meatless meals . Back in Washington , caterer Bill Homan , of Design Cuisine , recalled a wedding reception where an extra table was set with sandwich fixings . Guests were invited to make sandwiches , which then were delivered to homeless people . <p> Martin Feinstein , general director of the Washington Opera , and his wife , Bernice , do a lot of cast entertaining in their McLean home . " No cutbacks , " said she . " I 've always worked within a budget . Because we 're nonprofit , my mind is trained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " However , she cited the recessionary blues mentality of a wealthy friend . Instead of ordering ready-to-eat shrimp from a caterer , the friend bought it at a wharf market and invited four companions to spend two hours peeling and deveining the stuff . " She wanted to save money , " said Bernice Feinstein . " She would n't have done that a couple years ago . " <p> Jewell and Darrell Green have their own reasons for conserving with pasta and Chinese takeout parties at their Vienna home . When you 're a 33-year-old Redskins quarterback with 10 seasons notched on your helmet , " you have to try to live on the same pace , so it wo n't be that much lower when the career is over , " said Jewell Green . <p> ' Down-Home Simple ' <p> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell is in the minority when it comes to entertaining in Washington . Though the Democrat from Maine lent his cachet to the " Entertaining People " charity , " he never gives dinner parties at home on Capitol Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vignette . " As a bachelor , he does n't even have a dining room . " Mindful of the old saw about tax-and-spend Democrats , Mitchell instructed Wilson to keep her exhibit " low-key , non-glitzy and down-home simple . " Result : a lobster in a pot on a back porch in a Maine setting . <p> " We never entertain , " said " Today " show co-host Katie Couric , who is married to Washington attorney Jay Monahan . " I 've used my wedding china once . The last time we entertained , there were six people sitting around the kitchen table eating my mom 's lasagna . I 'm lucky if I can stay awake past 8 p.m , " she added . <p> At the other extreme is Carol Foley , wife of real estate developer Robert T. Foley . A co-founder of " Entertaining People " a decade ago , she entertains frequently in their large Georgian house in Northwest Washington . Black-tie dinner dances for several hundred guests are a staple . " We always have live music and champagne , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We do the right thing for the event . A great big splash is n't appropriate . We do n't want to be too flashy when people are homeless . " <p> Another accomplished hostess is Elaine Silverstein , wife of lawyer Leonard Silverstein , of Bethesda . She said her annual December ladies ' tea has become a tradition . Sometimes she has catered formal dinners ; other times she cooks . The couple , who are patrons of the arts , think people today are weighing which charitable events they can support , she said . But she defended entertainment , noting it also provides jobs . <p> Actress Kitty Carlisle Hart , who is chairman of the New York State Council on the Arts , declared that while charity events in New York City have become less elaborate and less expensive during the recession , entertaining at home has n't changed . " As a woman alone she is the widow of playwright Moss Hart , I am terrorized by any kind of party where there are no place cards , " she confided . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and particularly ladies ' lunches  --  which , she observed , the late playwright Lillian Hellman once condemned as " the vilest form of entertainment . " She said she serves mainly chicken and fish , adding that the lamb chops women fancy have become very expensive . As for caviar , " I have n't bought any in a long while , " she noted . <p> Last November Heather Cohane , publisher of the slick society magazine Quest , for Upper East Siders in New York , urged her well-off friends who were being told it was n't chic to spend money any more to do it on the QT to help the economy . " Since there is no need to tell anyone you 're doing it , you can remain as chic as ever in your friends ' eyes , " she reminded them . <p> In February , her message is even blunter : " If you do n't spend , who will ?
