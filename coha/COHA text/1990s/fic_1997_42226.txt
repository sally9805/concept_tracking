So far as we know , Paul Park is the author of delightfully baroque and rich novels such as Celestis , The Gospel of Corax , and the Starbridge chronicles . An e-mail we received from him notes that this story appeared first electronically in February in Omni Online , but you 'll forgive us if we wonder about the veracity of all these facts once you read this brief report . <p> HERE 'S HOW I FOUND OUT : I was in a bar called Dave 's on East 14th Street . It was n't my usual place . I had been dating a woman in Stuyvesant Town . One night after I left her place , I still was n't eager to go home . So on my way I stopped into Dave 's . I used to spend a lot of time in bars , though I do n't smoke or drink . But I like the secondhand stuff . And the conversations you could have with strangers - you could tell them anything . " Ottawa is a fine city , " you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could say , though in fact I 'm an only child . But people would nod their heads . This kind of storytelling used to drive my ex-wife crazy . " It 's so pointless . It 's not like you 're pretending you 're an astronaut or a circus clown . That I could see . But a Canadian ? " " It 's a subtle thrill , " I conceded . " Why not tell the truth ? " Barbara would say . " That you 're a successful lawyer with a beautiful wife you do n't deserve . Is that so terrible ? " Not terrible so much as difficult to believe . It sounded pretty thin , even before I found out . And of course none of it turned out to be true at all . Anyway , that night I was listening to someone else . Someone was claiming he had seen Reggie Jackson 's last game on TV . I nodded , but all the time I was looking past him toward a corner of the bar , where a man was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drinking , and I recognized him . But I did n't know from where . I stared at him for a few minutes . What was different-had he shaved his beard ? Then suddenly I realized he was in the wrong country . It was Boris Bezugly . It truly was . I took my club soda over to join him . We had parted on such good terms . " Friends , friends ! " he had shouted drunkenly on the platform of Petersburg Station , saliva dripping from his lips . Now he was drunk again . He sat picking at the wax of the red candle . When he looked up at me , I saw nothing in his face , just bleared eyes and a provisionary smile . We had met two years before , when a partner in the firm was scouting the possibility of a branch office in Moscow . Even in Russia he was the drunkest man I ever met . When we were introduced , he had passed out and fallen on his back as we were still shaking hands . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , I thought . After all , it had taken me a moment . But we were in New York . Surely running into me was not as strange as me running into him . And why had n't he told me he was coming ? " Sdravsvuytse , " I said , grinning . " Can I buy you a drink ? " What passed over his face was an expression of such horror and rage , it made me put up my hand . But then his face went blank and he turned away from me , huddling around his candle and his drink . He had lost weight , and his black beard was gone . In Russia he had worn a hilarious mismatch of plaid clothes , surmounted by an old fur cap . Now he wore a tweed suit , a denim shirt open at the neck . The cap was gone . " Boris , " I said . In Russia his English had been absurd . I used to tell him he sounded like a hit man in a cold war novel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and softly in a mid-Atlantic accent : " I think you 're making a mistake . " And I would have thought so , too , except for the strange expression I had seen . So I persevered . I pulled out one of the chairs and sat down . " What are you doing ? " he cried . " My God , if they find us . If they see us here . " These words gave me what I thought was a glimmer of understanding . In Moscow , in the kitchen of his tiny apartment , Boris once had put away enough vodka to let him pass through drunkenness into another stage , a kind of clarity and grim sobriety . Then he had told me what his life was like under the Communists - the lies that no one had believed . The interrogations . When he was a student in the sixties after Brezhnev first came in , he had spent two years in protective custody . Now maybe he was remembering those times . " My friend , " I said , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These words seemed to fill him with another gust of fury . He tried to get up , and I could see he was very drunk . " I do n't know you , I 've never met you , " he muttered , grinding out his cigarette butt . But then the cocktail waitress was there . " I 'll take a club soda , " I said . " And my friend will have a Smirnoff 's . " " No , " he snarled , " that was the problem with that job . Get me a bourbon , " he told the waitress . Then to me : " I hate vodka . " Which surprised me more than anything he 'd said so far . In Moscow he had recited poetry about vodka . " Yeah , " he told me now , smiling in spite of himself . " Tastes change . " Apparently he had reassured himself that no one was watching us . But he waited until the waitress had come and gone before he spoke again . " Boris , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me that . It was just a job , a two-week job . I barely remember it . " " What are you talking about ? " He smiled . " You do n't know , do you ? You really do n't know . Get a grip , " he said . " It 's like candy from a baby . " I saw such a mix of passions in his face . Envy , frustration , anger , fear . And then a kind of malignant grin that was so far from my perception of his character that I stared at him , fascinated . " You never went to Russia , " he said . " You 've never met a single Russian . You were in a theme park they built outside Helsinki , surrounded by people like me . They were paying us to guzzle vodka and wear false beards and act like clowns . " Sdravsvuytse , " my ass ! " He was crazy . " My poor friend , " I said . " Who was paying you ? The KGB ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spilling bourbon on the polyurethaned wood . " Not the KGB , " he hissed . " The KGB never existed . None of it existed . None of this . " He waved his hand around the room . He was in the middle of a paranoid breakdown of some sort . I could see that . And yet the moment I heard him , I felt instinctively that what he said was true . " They never would have taken you to Russia , " he went on . " Not to the real Russia . " As he spoke I brought back my own memories - the grime , the cold , the sullen old babushkas with rags around their heads . The concrete apartment blocks . The horrible food . He put down his empty glass . " Thanks for the drink . And now I 'm definitely getting out of here before somebody sees us . Because this is definitely against the rules . " Then he was gone , and I walked home . And maybe I would n't have thought much about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my lunch hour , and I passed the offices for Aeroflot . I went in and sat down with the people who were waiting to be helped . We were in a row of armchairs next to the window . This is ridiculous , I thought . And I was about to get up and go , when I found myself staring at a travel poster . One of the agents was talking on the phone , and there was a framed poster of Red Square above her desk . And was that Boris Bezugly in the middle of a group of smiling Russians in front of St. Basil 's ? The beard , the hat , the absurd plaid ? The Aeroflot agent was a dark-haired , heavy-chested woman , dressed in black pumps , beige tights , and a black mini-skirt . A parody of a Russian vamp . And what was that language she was speaking on the phone ? The more I listened , the more improbable it sounded . I asked the woman sitting next to me . She frowned . " Russian , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sure ? Made-up gobbledygook , but of course once you let yourself start thinking like that , the whole world starts to fall apart . Not immediately , but gradually . I took the woman from Stuyvesant Town to a musical on Broadway . Critics had pretended to like it , though it was obviously bad . Audience members had applauded , laughed - who were they trying to fool ? At work sometimes I found it hard to concentrate . I was representing the plaintiff in a civil suit . Yet no actual client could have been so petty , so vindictive . In my office I sat staring at the man , watching his lips move , waiting for him to give himself away . And of course I spent more of my time at Dave 's . I would go there every evening after work , and in time I was drinking more than just club sodas . But it was weeks before I saw Boris again . He came in out of a freezing rain and made his way directly toward me , where I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without asking and leaned forward , rubbing his hands over the tiny candle flame . " Listen , " he said , " I 'm in trouble , " and he looked it . He needed a shave . His eyes were bloodshot . He was n't wearing a coat . " Listen , I ca n't do it anymore . All that lying and pretending . I 've screwed up two more jobs and now they 're on to me . I ca n't go home . Please , can you give me some money ? I 've got to get away . " " I 'll pay you fifty dollars for some information , " I said . I took the bills from my pocket , but he interrupted me . " No , I mean your watch or something . I ca n't use that bogus currency . " He pulled some coins out of the pocket of his pants , big , shiny , aluminum coins like Mardi Gras doubloons . In fact as I looked closely , I saw that 's what they were . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pete Fountain playing the clarinet . " I do n't even have enough here for a drink , " he said . " I 'll get you one . " I raised my hand for the waitress . But then I saw her at-the corner of the bar , talking with the bartender . As I watched , she pointed over at us . " Oh my God , " said my Russian friend . His voice was grim and strange . " Give me the watch . " I stripped it off , though it was an expensive Seiko . " Thanks , " he said , looking at the face , the sweep of the second hand . " And in return I 'll answer one minute 's worth of questions . Go . " " Who are you ? " I asked . But he shrugged irritably . " No , it 's not important . My name is Nathan - so what ? What about you " " I know about myself , " I said uncertainly . " Do you ? Paul Park , Esq . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were smart enough to go to the real Yale ? Do you think they let just anybody in " Actually , I had always kind of wondered about that . So his words gave me a painful kind of pleasure . Then he went on : " Twenty seconds . What about your marriage ? What was that all about ? " " I 'm divorced . " " Of course you are . The woman who was playing your wife landed another job . It was never supposed to be more than a two-year contract with an option , which she chose not to renew . Last I heard , she was doing Medea , Blanche Dubois , and Lady Macbeth for some repertory company up in Canada . " Again , this sounded so hideously plausible that I said nothing . " Forty seconds . " " Fifty seconds . " " Wait , " I said , but he was gone out the door . He left only his Pete Fountain doubloon , which I slid into my pocket . Then in a little while the police were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , asking me questions . " Did he say where he was going ? Did he give you anything ? " " No , " I said . " No . Nothing . " But then when I was watching TV later that night , I saw that Nathan Rose , a performance artist wanted in connection with several outstanding warrants , had been arrested . There was a photograph , and a brief description of his accomplishments . Nathan Rose had been a promising young man , recipient of several grants from the National Endowment for the Arts . The newscaster 's voice was sad and apologetic , and she seemed to look out of the television directly at me . She made no mention of the crime he 'd been accused of . What was it - impersonating a Russian ? That night was the beginning of a quick decline for me , because success in life depends on not asking too many questions . The patterns of illusion that made up the modem world require a kind of faith , a suspension of disbelief . The revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found myself hustled out of what I 'd thought was my real world as rudely as I might have been thrown out of a magic show , if I had stood up in the audience and explained the tricks while the performance was in progress . But of course at that time I could only guess at the real truth . I conceived the idea that the government had hired an enormous troupe of actors , administered and paid for by the NEA , to create and sustain an illusion of reality for certain people . At first I played with the idea that I might be the only one , but no . That was too grandiose , too desperate a fantasy . So much money , so much effort , just to make a fool out of a single citizen . The Republicans never would have stood for it . Providing jobs for actors just was n't that important , even in New York . I lost my job , my friends , and my apartment . I refused to work long hours for play money . And no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept trying to catch them in small lies and inconsistencies . I would ask them questions . " If this is just a job for you , why are n't you nicer to me ? Surely we 'd enjoy it more . How can we turn this into a comedy ? A farce ? A musical ? " By the middle of December I was living by the train tracks , inside the tunnel under Riverside Park . Maybe it was n't necessary for me to have gone that far . But at a certain point , I thought I 'd try to penetrate down below the level of deception . Because I imagined that the illusions were falser and more elaborate the higher up you went , which is why so many rich people are crazy . Wherever they go , part of their brain is mumbling to the other part , " Surely the actual Plaza Hotel is n't such a dump . Surely an authentic Mercedes corners better than this . Surely a genuine production of Hamlet is n't quite so dull . Surely the real Alps are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my tarpaulin tent next to the train tracks , wrapped in my blankets , it was hard for me to think that the real Riverside Park was even darker , even colder , even more miserable . I was dressed in a dinner jacket I had kept from my apartment . I was glutted with hors d'oeuvres , drunk on chablis , because New York provides many opportunities to a man in black tie , especially around Christmas time . I had attended office parties and openings all the way from midtown , pretending all the way . I had been an architect , an actor , a designer , a literary agent . In each place as I grew drunker , the lies I told grew more outrageous , yet people still smiled and nodded . Why not ? They were being paid good Mardi Gras doubloons to pretend to believe me . In my tent , I slid my hand down into my pocket and clasped my hand around my own Pete Fountain coin , perhaps , I thought , the only genuine thing I 'd ever owned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , let it calm me until I was n't sure if I could move even if I 'd wanted to . My hands and legs were stiff and strange . I looked up the tunnel into the dark and imagined how the world was changing outside , how in the morning I would climb out through the grate into a new world of heat and light and honesty . As the hours passed , the walls of the tunnel seemed to close around me . But yes , there was some light down toward the tunnel 's mouth , too bright , too soft for dawn . Yes , it seemed to fill the hole , to chase away the darkness , and it was as if I had left my body and was drifting toward it , suspended over the tracks . There was heat , too , beyond my fingertips , and as I drifted down the tunnel I felt it penetrate my body and my soul . I imagined faces in the tunnel with me , people standing along the rails , smiling and murmuring . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones I recognized : my mother , my grandparents , my childhood friends , and even Barbara , my ex-wife . Yes , I thought , this is the truth . It could n't last forever . I was sprawled over the tracks , and the light was coming toward me . I listened to the muffled voices and the creak of the wheels , and the light was all around me . It was so bright , I had to close my eyes . As I did so , I heard somebody say , " That 's it . That 's a wrap . " When I sat up , I was in a crowd of people and machines . The big lamp had gone out , replaced by a yellow fluorescent line along the middle of the vault . By its light I could see much that had been hidden from me . For one thing , the entire tunnel was only about twenty-five yards long . I could see the brick ends of it now , cunningly painted to look like train tracks disappearing in both directions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a platform , which ran on wheels along the rails . Now that the lamp was out , I could see the movie camera beneath it , the camera man stripping off his gloves and his coat ; they had turned off the refrigeration machines . There was a whole line of them along the wall , and I guess they had been making quite a racket , because now I could hear all kinds of talking from the crew as they finished up . I threw aside my blanket and sat rubbing my hands . Nobody was paying any attention to me . But then I saw my mother coming toward me through a crowd of technicians , and she squatted down . " Congratulations , " she said . " That was great . " " Mother , " I stammered , " is it really you ? " I admit I was surprised to see her , because she had passed away in the spring of 1978 . She was wearing a silk shirt , blue jeans , and cowboy boots . She was smiling . " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few weeks you 've made me proud I ever got to work with you . Proud you 're my son , so to speak . The paranoia , the anger , the disgust . It was all so real . " " Mother , " I said , " I ca n't believe it . You look so young . " She winked . " Yeah , sure . You 've probably never seen me without makeup . But let 's not get carried away . Somewhere along the line you must have guessed . That was the whole point of this game . " She stood up . And now others were helping me to my feet . I recognized a few old faces , and then Barbara was there . " Your suit 's a mess , " she said . I was stunned , overwhelmed to see her . Her freckled nose . Her crooked smile . She reached up to touch my damp bow-tie . When I 'd known her , her breath had always been a little sour , a symptom of chronic gastric distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I caught a whiff of the mints she used - the same old brand . At least that was for real , I thought . Her little head was close to my lapel . Packed with brains . I 'd always said that was the reason she so easily outwitted me . The space inside her skull was so small that her thoughts never had more than an inch or so to travel , to make connections . Her ideas moved faster , like molecules in a gas when it 's condensed . And at the moment when I smelled her breath , I felt a little surge of hope . Even if there was no place for me in her old life , maybe now there might be some new way for us to be together in this new world . Cleverer than me , maybe she had already had the same idea , because I felt her arms around me , her head against my cheek as I bent down . " I 'm sorry I was so mean , " she whispered . " But I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , the things I had to do to you . I 'm not normally so promiscuous . " Mother and the rest had disappeared , and we were surrounded by technicians packing up equipment . " I just wanted to tell you right away , " she said . " Before anybody else talks to you . Sex and betrayal are the only things that keep the yuppie games alive . The only reason anybody wants to play . So I had to . That thing where you caught me with your boss 's wife - I actually protested to the writers . I cried for days when we were finished . " Then she took my hand and led me outside . It was early morning . We walked through a park that seemed all of a sudden only twenty-five yards wide , and it was rapidly disappearing as people rolled up the astroturf and wheeled away the papier-mache balustrades . The night before , I had come down to the park the way I always did , along West 98th Street . Now as we approached Riverside Drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle the painted plywood facades of the buildings , all just a few inches thick . On 98th Street itself there was a huge crew striking the set , so instead of going back that way , Barbara led me north , uptown , and soon we were lost among streets I did n't recognize , although I 'd lived on the Upper West Side my whole life . " Where are we ? " I asked faintly . " Toronto . They always use it for the New York shoots . The real New York is so expensive . It 's like American actors - no one can afford them anymore . We use Canadians for everything . " " So what was this ? " I asked . " A movie or a game ? " " Both . It 's interactive TV . A few hired professionals like me and your mom , and then tons of paying customers . They do most of the minor characters , the extras and what-not . Then the whole thing is broadcast live , with your thoughts picked up on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what made the show-you were so innocent , so clueless . The show started when you were fifteen , which meant it took you twenty-two years to figure out what was going on . It 's a new record . And in the end we had to give you massive hints . " " When I was fifteen ? " " Sure . All the rest was just recovered-memory syndrome . Who wants to make a show about a kid ? I mean except for all the shows within the show . Beaver Cleaver and so forth . " " Beaver Cleaver ? " " No expense was spared , " said Barbara . " It 's the information superhighway . But you have to understand - this was a huge deal . " She was right . By the time we hit Yonge Street a crowd had gathered . Old ladies , teenagers , men , women , all wanting to shake my hand and get my autograph . I was a celebrity , like O.J. Simpson or Woody Allen , except of course I really existed . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer-generated film clips . " Mr. Park , " somebody shouted . " When did you know for sure ? " " Show us the doubloon ! " demanded another , and when I took it from my pocket , everyone laughed and clapped . An old man grasped my hand . I recognized him as the super of the building next to mine . " I just wanted to say you 've given my wife and me such pleasure over the years . Most of the shows should be banned from the airwaves , if it was up to me . But you never even raised your voice . No violence at all . Not that you were n't tempted , " he said , giving Barbara a severe look . Then the limo arrived , small and sleek . Inside I could hear a small hum , as if from a computer . No one was driving . We pulled out slowly into the wide street , and then we were heading downtown . " So what was the show 's name ? " I asked . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when she saw my face , she grinned . " Oh come on , do n't take it like that . Sure , you were kind of a wimp , but the guy is right . It was a wholesome show . Every day we found new ways to humiliate you , but you just soldiered on . Most of the time you did n't even notice . I mean sure , you were a total moron , but that was all right . It was your dignity that people loved . " We drove on through the unfamiliar streets . " I guess it did n't keep me from being canceled , " I said . " Well , to tell the truth it was all a little dated . And you needed a good female lead . That fat tart in Stuyvesant Town just was n't doing it . People seemed to find your life less interesting as soon as I bailed out . " " I guess I felt the same way . " Barbara patted my hand . " But you were still popular among retirees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition is . Like the guy said , they gave over most of the twentieth century to war games . Vietnam , KKK , Holocaust , Cold War , Hiroshima . Those are all the American shows . Kids love them , even the minorities . But I ca n't stand them . " " Hiroshima ? " I asked . She smiled . " Meanwhile , we thought it was a stroke of genius to work all that into the background of Get a Grip . To show what life in America might have been like if it had all really happened . Of course we had to change the footage and the point of view- reshoot a lot of it . Most of those shows are ridiculously patriotic . " " Ingenious , " I murmured . " But that 's how we got into trouble . ABC claimed it was copyright infringement , and the American ambassador protested . But Get a Grip was a satire , for God 's sake . Even the U.S. courts ruled in our favor . " After a little while I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , that 's what I 'm telling you . The Americans were furious for years . So ABC finally made a hostile bid for Ottawa Communication , which produced your show . The deal went through last week , and Get a Grip was canceled . But there had been rumors for months , which was why the writers brought back all that Russian stuff last fall . They wanted to take the show to its own end . " " No . I mean , what really happened ? In the world . " She squeezed my arm . " Do n't worry . You 'll soon catch up . Besides , we 're here . " We pulled up in front of a hotel . " You 'll love it , " she said . " Czar Nicholas III stayed here last time he was in town . " So I got out and followed her up the steps . In through the revolving doors . The lobby was all ormolu and velvet and gilt mantelpieces . The elevator ran in a cage up through the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked as we got in . " Goddamn it , Pogo , do n't be such a dope . " I hated when she called me " Pogo . " It was a nickname left over from my earliest childhood , and she only used it to annoy me . But as I rode up in the elevator , it occurred to me that maybe no one had ever really called me that . Maybe all those painful memories had been induced when I was fifteen . Maybe they had all been covered in a flashback , when Get a Grip first went on the air . My eyes filled with tears . " What 's the matter now ? " said Barbara . " Honest to God , you 'd think you were being boiled over a slow fire . It 's the best hotel in town . I thought you might want to rest for a few hours , take a shower , change your clothes before the reception at the president 's house tonight . The Russian ambassador will be there - I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come on , is that so terrible ? " Then when we were alone together in the jewel-box room , she said , " Besides , I 've missed you . " But I was n't listening . I was looking at my face in the mirror above the dresser . The same curly hair and gullible eyes , as if nothing had happened . " My whole life has been a parody , " I said , watching my lips move . But then I had to smile , because it was exactly what I might have said back in America , back during the salad days of Get a Grip . Barbara was behind me . In the mirror I saw her undo the first few buttons of her blouse , and then slip it off her shoulders . " Let me make it okay for you , " she said . Then it was like a dream come true , because she was leading me to the bed and pulling off my clothes . I had thought about this moment so many times since we split up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scene . In my mind , sometimes she was harsh and fast , sometimes passive and accommodating . Sometimes it took hours , and sometimes it was over right away . But none of my fantasizing prepared me for this moment , which was not sublime so much as strange . During two years of marriage , I thought I had got to know her well . But I had never done any of the things she required of me in that hotel room ; I had never heard of anybody doing them . But , " Things are different here , " she whispered . " Let me teach you how to make it in the real world , " she said , before I lost consciousness . Then I came to , and I was lying on the bed . Barbara was in the shower . I could hear the water running . I sat naked on the side of the bed , staring at the television . It was in a lacquer cabinet on top of a marble table , and the remote was on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Then suddenly I was seized with a new suspicion , and I flicked it on . I flicked through several channels , seeing nothing but football games . But there I was on channel 599xtc , buck naked , staring at myself . Behind me the hotel room , the ripped sheets and soggy pillows . And on the bottom comer of the screen , a blinking panel that said : PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE . Then Barbara was there , toweling her neck , looking over my shoulder . " Okay , so it 's not quite over yet , " she said . " There are still some things you ought to know . " "
