Just in case you ca n't get enough of those precious poseurs on American Gladiators , two new copycat challengers are headed for the airwaves . Knights and Warriors will pit villains like Princess Malice and Venom against challengers from health clubs everywhere . In Warriors on Wheels , players in souped-up vehicles will compete in events like Road Kill ( shooting at passing targets ) and Flights of Destruction ( crashing their wheels ) . Slime Bomb we do n't want to know about . Do n't look for them on PBS.
