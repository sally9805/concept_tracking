THE DOUBLE RAP ON THE DOOR iS SO perfunctory and yet rhythmic that James thinks for a moment of one of his son 's knock-knock jokes . He is tempted to call out , " Who 's there ? " Instead he undoes the locks : first the deadbolt , then the security chain . He refuses , unlike most of his friends in Center City , to add a police bar . On the Main Line , where James used to live with his wife and child , opening the front door was a simpler and faster business . <p> The man who stands in the hall is bald . He looks older than James , but probably he is younger . It 's hard to tell without the hair . The man 's shining head is too small for his body and looks tentative on his neck , as if it had been severed and put back , balanced carefully so it would n't topple . He looks startled to see James . The stranger shuffles on the gold carpet , staring over James 's shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls from the air to his pocket , as if reaching for the key to the lock . James has just unbolted . James wonders if the bald man is a thief , but a thief would be quick to explain his presence . This man has no story ready . He makes James feel that it is James who must say something . James recovers himself and asks , " Can I help you ? " <p> It is fast , but unmistakable : the resentful look on the stranger 's face is oddly familiar . But he quickly becomes embarrassed . He says , " I 'm sorry . I used to live in this apartment four years ago . I 'm back in Philadelphia on business and I was passing by the old place  --  " <p> " Would you like to come in ? " James wants to set the man at ease , but both of them know now that it was a mistake for the bald man ever to have come . He must have known that someone else would be living in his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else in possession . That was why he knocked like a janitor who expects to repair a sink while a tenant is away : two raps that were more of a warning than a summons . He had not really expected anyone to come to the door . <p> " By the way , my name 's Hal Bauhofer , " says the bald man . James wonders if Hal is a salesman . They are the only people James has ever known who introduce themselves as if they were changing the subject . <p> " James Mason . " Hal offers to shake hands , but James pretends not to see . He wishes he could leave and allow the bald man to poke about the studio apartment undisturbed . Hal is making conversation , but his eyes are focusing on what must be familiar places : the worn area of the industrial-grade carpet , the dark stain on the ceiling over the Murphy bed . What is Hal remembering ? James tries to decide if he is the type who would have made love on the rug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shirt so faded that the stripes are blurred . Maybe a computer whiz . The ones who report to James dress like students and can talk easily only with each other . Hal is saying , " For such a small place it 's not bad . The view keeps you from feeling closed in . " <p> " How long were you here ? " <p> " Two years . " James can not imagine living here so long . His friends told him he was lucky to find a furnished place on such short notice . And the view from the seventeenth floor is remarkable . The picture window faces south , and at night he watches the kaleidoscopic flames of the oil refineries . But there are the storms . Since childhood he has been terrified of lightning , and since childhood he has been ashamed of his fear . He had not realized when he rented a high-rise apartment that he would be closer to the bolts . He knows that the electricity rises from the ground , but it is impossible to believe that here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem worth it . Who knows what will happen , or what Liz means by " time alone to think things over " ? James has not even told his parents , not certain whether they will ever have to know . <p> And Henry loves everything about the high-rise : the waving wire sculpture in the lobby that looks like a bad Calder , the elevator , the elderly doorman who gives Henry dimes . Most of all his son likes the pool . After two weeks James joined the health club on the thirtieth floor . The top floor is glassed in on four sides , and spider plants dangle with more exotic ferns above the water . James lets the five-year-old stay up late when he visits . There 's no school anyway , and after ten the pool is deserted . A scotch inside him , James floats with Henry in his arms . They both love this jungle that spins amid thousands of tiny lights , which seem more like low-lying stars than the lamps of distant homes . <p> Henry will tap his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asks James . <p> " Gorilla . " <p> " Gorilla Who ? " <p> " Gorilla my dreams ! " <p> They laugh , floating in the sky . <p> Hal has crossed to the window . He sinks into a green chair , though James has not invited him to sit . " This chair was here in my day , " says the bald man . He is beefy but tall , spreading his arms and legs and slouching in the studio 's one comfortable chair . Of course he must have sat there often in two years , many more hours than James has yet occupied it , though it is also his favorite chair . Hal looks too comfortable . <p> " Would you like some coffee ? " James asks coldly . It is something he learned from Liz . She offers to make him coffee when he goes out to Narberth to pick up Henry . The one time he accepted , he had to sit at his own grandmother 's table at Liz 's invitation , watching while she poured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of little ways to remind her that it is his house too . " What are you looking for ? " he asks her when she rummages in a drawer . <p> " The tea cozy , " she tells him . He jumps up to get it from the lower right-hand drawer , but the aluminum foil is where the dishcloths are supposed to be . " I rearranged the kitchen , " she says . She has asked him to ring the bell , not to use his key . " I ca n't just walk in and find you on the sofa , " she says reasonably . " It would scare me . " <p> It bothers him to see how his wife is letting the place go . Last time he was there he pointed out the condensation on the bedroom windows . " That 's from the shower , " he said . " Look here where the paint is chipped away . The water is just sitting there rotting the wood . Let that go through the winter and you may have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Liz makes an airy gesture . " I 'll think about it . " <p> But she wo n't . She used to nag him to keep things neat , but she has no sense of real maintenance , the possibilities of structural damage . " I 'll sand it and put on primer next time I 'm here , " he offers . <p> " Do n't bother , " she says . " It 's not your problem . " <p> " It damn well is my problem . This house is my major investment , and I do n't want to see it fall apart . " <p> " The house is n't falling apart . " Her reasonable tone makes him angrier than if she 'd flown off the handle . He can feel the draft from the kitchen door , where he 'd meant to replace the weather stripping . <p> Hal asks if he can use the bathroom while James is making coffee . It is only a gesture : he is already headed for the door before James can give permission . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James pours the ground coffee in without measuring . It will be strong . He has asked his lawyer friend , Bob , about the house , and Bob assured him that Liz would get it . " But you might get something if she sold it , " Bob said . " And some furniture , of course . " It is not even a particularly beautiful house-an undistinguished row house was all they could afford at the time . But he had not wanted to move even after he became head of marketing , had not wanted to leave the surfaces rubbed smooth with his own daily passing or the rooms encrusted with Henry 's childhood . <p> Hal drinks his coffee silently . James leaves him alone . He is no longer resentful . For all Hal 's certainty that James should not be there , it is Hal who will have to leave . James does not offer the previous tenant a second cup . He has tried to be kind . He understands why people feel they should always have entry to a place where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tired , and it is 6:00 , time to go pick up Henry . <p> " Thanks for letting me look around , " says Hal . He waves at the door . " It must have seemed crazy , my barging in here like this . " <p> " No , of course not , " says James . " Anytime . " He dislikes people who blurt out their embarrassment , forcing others to absolve them . <p> In Narberth , Henry greets his father at the door . Liz is nowhere in sight . " Want to hear a knock-knock joke ? " <p> " Sure , " says James . <p> " Say knock-knock . " <p> " Knock-knock , " says James obediently , scanning the stairs . He has still not entered the house . Is Liz upstairs , getting ready to go out ? <p> " Who 's there ? " <p> It takes James several long seconds to register that this time he is on the wrong side of the joke . His son is laughing , delighted to have turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " James scoops Henry up in his arms . " I ca n't believe I fell for that . " Henry crows . <p> " Who 's there ? " Liz calls down the stairs . James is struck by her unconscious echo of Henry 's riddle . <p> " The Boston Strangler , " he says . " Who do you think ? " <p> She comes halfway down the staircase and perches on a stair . She bends one leg to slip soft gray sandals on over her stockings . " Hello , James . " <p> The greeting strikes him as strangely formal , at odds with the teasing familiarity of her dressing on the stair . His wife 's hair looks wiry and thick , strong somehow , like it does when she 's just washed it . He 's almost sure that her pretending not to expect him is part of her general campaign to make him feel displaced , like he does n't belong here , but it 's just barely possible that someone else is coming . He knows he 's not supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment that she 's dressed for going out . <p> Liz descends the remaining stairs and hands him Henry 's suitcase , already packed and resting out of sight behind the curved banister . They all leave together , Liz whirling on the threshold to lock the house from outside with the key . It occurs to James that he is losing ground ; this time Liz arranged things so that he got no further than the vestibule . She gives Henry a hug and reminds James that the boy still has poison ivy . " I packed the calamine lotion , " she says . Henry turns to wave to his mother , but James does not look back . The electric garage door opener is whirring as he and Henry round the corner towards the commuter train station . <p> Mrs. Lloyd is coming out of her apartment when they step out of the elevator at the high-rise . " So this is your son , " she says , stretching out a hand to Henry . James sees his son check an impulse to step back . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , " she says . <p> Mrs. Lloyd is not really as boring as her remarks to Henry suggest . She 's not interested in children , but she feels obliged to extend herself to them . She sounds more natural when she informs James darkly , " Milly Stephens is leaving . " <p> " I 'm sorry to hear that . " Milly Stephens , like Mrs. Lloyd , is one of the few tenants left from the time before the current landlord took over the high-rise . The new owner put in the doorman and the sculpture and the new carpeting and the health club and raised the rents forty percent . Most of the other older women were forced out , but Mrs. Lloyd can easily afford the new prices . Robert Lloyd left her very well off . James knows people in the city who still speak well of her husband , an investment banker who died ten years ago . James told her that he knew of her husband 's reputation when she introduced herself the first week he moved into the building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes Emily Lloyd for her own sake . He likes her furniture . The door to her apartment stands open behind her , and James can see the mahogany buffet filling the entryway . The cupboard displays a complete set of Haviland china and a silver bowl of peonies . The buffet is far too large for the space , but all of Mrs. Lloyd 's apartment is stuffed with solid , inappropriate furniture she could not bear to leave behind when she sold her old house . James has wondered if she will move now that her friends are mostly gone and she is so out of place here among the new crowd of young lawyers and restauranteurs who work out at the health club in the evenings . But looking at her furniture he does not think so . It is dark , weighty stuff , meant to rest for decades against the same wall . He thinks of the flimsy pieces in his own furnished apartment . The bed and the desk and the pullout couch are all collapsible  --  aluminum tubes and detachable cushions and notched pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the model planes he makes for Henry . All except the one large , heavy chair that James usually sits in and that Hal Bauhofer occupied this afternoon . <p> " A man came by today who used to live in my apartment . " Out of the corner of his eye . James sees that Henry is fidgeting and scratching his poison ivy . " You might know him  --  a large bald man . Tall . " <p> " I think he was here three or four years ago when I moved in . If he 's the one I 'm thinking of , he was with an Indian woman . India-Indian , I mean . She had the loveliest hair . " <p> " His name 's Hal Bauhofer . " <p> " I did n't know his name , but I 'm sure it 's the one . " She is clearly excited by the recognition , but James can not think why . Henry is giving his father meaningful looks , so James disengages himself from Mrs. Lloyd before she has quite extracted all interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as James opens the door . " Can we go up to the pool ? " The child 's voice shows his impatience with the delay in the hall , his intolerance of the adult proceedings . <p> " It 's too bad we ca n't . The pool 's closed this week . The men are working on it . " <p> " I want to go . " Sulky , about to cry . <p> " I know you do , but there 's nothing I can do . " A psychiatrist James once heard on a talk show said children will respond well if parents show that they share in their child 's powerless position . " I 'd like to go swimming , too , " he says . <p> Henry starts to cry . <p> Only after Henry is finally asleep ( late , after a prolonged tussle of wills ) does James settle into the comfortable chair . It is one of those low recliners , wonderful while you are sunk down in it but hard to struggle up out of , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son has worn him out . It is strange : now James feels an enormous happiness to have his son sleeping under his roof , his own walls enclosing those small breaths . But he has not enjoyed the long evening of trying to occupy a bored and cranky Henry . Only now , remembering the evening , can he feel the love that rose in him as he rinsed the soap from his son 's unbelievably tiny ribs , so fragile they remind James of the breastbone of a quail . He loves the physical sensation of his son 's presence but does not always want to deal with his moods . Once he tried to explain this to Liz . He said it was as if he were waiting for Henry to grow up so that he would enjoy him more . She seemed to understand this at the time , but later she used it against him . This betrayal struck him as the essence of love gone wrong : the intimacies love made possible resurfacing as threads in their quarrels . <p> When she told him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was the only thing she knew to do , the only thing that would get through to him . " You 're like a cat , " she said . " You get more attached to places than to people . " He said that was nonsense , that he loved her and that he loved Henry . " I know , " she said then , " but you love us the way other people love places . You just want us to be here . " <p> " Of course I want you here . What 's wrong with that ? " <p> Liz shook her head . <p> The first streak of lightning seems to singe James in his chair . It 's the nasty kind : no general flash lighting the clouds but a sharp , moving line of fire seeking somewhere to land its charge . He 's sweating waiting for the thunder . He knows it will be a crack , not a roll . When it comes , Henry is calling to him from the doorway . James can see his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't make out the words . <p> "  --  to the bathroom . " <p> Even in his terror James wants to laugh . The storm is just background for the child , while his old man is scared to death . The presence of another person allows James to behave normally ; he ushers his son to the bathroom . When Henry returns , he is trying to pull up his pajamas with one hand because in the other he carries a photograph . <p> " Who 's this ? " <p> A man and a woman stand in the small courtyard behind the highrise . James recognizes Hal 's beefy face . The woman is indeed IndiaIndian , though she wears western slacks and not a sari . <p> " That 's a man who used to live here , in this apartment . He came back to visit today . Where was the picture ? " <p> " Behind the toilet in there . On the floor . " Henry gestures towards the bathroom . <p> " He must have dropped it by accident . Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an urge to crawl under some large piece of furniture . He feels unbearably exposed high up here amidst all this collapsible junk . Twice when he was alone in the Narberth house during a storm , he cowered under a bed . Once he locked his office door and crouched under his desk to wait out some bad lightning . James does not like to remember these occasions . When people are around he can generally control his fear . He sits rigidly and does n't say much . Liz knows that storms make him nervous , but she has no idea how bad it is . <p> An hour after Henry goes back to sleep the storm has subsided enough for James to think of the photograph dropped on the floor by his chair . The surprising thing is that it 's a good picture : not some blurry polaroid snapshot but a sharply focused five-by-seven probably taken with a fifty millimeter lens and fine-grained film . Now he can see that though the Indian woman wears western clothes ( white slacks , an olive shirt that looks good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her forehead . A caste mark . Her waist-length black hair is braided into a thick rope . It 's impossible to tell how old Indian women are . The slow film heightens the fine lines around her mouth and eyes . She looks generally young , but defined , like a beautiful woman in her late thirties . She could be twenty-nine or forty-three , he does n't know . The western clothes distort her figure ; the rounded arms and hips meant for a sari curve in and out of the straight shirt and slacks . Her body reminds him of a homemade paper doll scalloped from a napkin . Hal in this picture looks young . Today James could not guess his age ; in the intervening years Hal has entered that indefinable area James would prefer to think of as young middle age . But in this photo he looks twenty-eight , maybe thirty . He has his shirt off , so that his bald head seems a natural continuation of his bare skin . The two of them are standing in front of the picnic table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those faded Indian bedspreads ; for some reason this strikes James as funny . There 's a hibachi , and hamburger buns spill out from a red and blue plastic wrapper . He sees a paper bag of groceries on the ground near the table , and a Coke bottle full of daffodils on the bench . It must be near this time of year , June , because the tulip tree is flowering behind them as it is now . The photo makes the courtyard look like a nice place for a picnic , but James knows it is n't . Half the residents in the high-rise walk their dogs down there so that the place is worse than a cow pasture . <p> The man and the woman are both smiling . They stand close , without touching . They do n't have their arms wrapped around one another in one of those stagy hugs for the camera . Instead their bodies lean toward one another in a way that James recognizes as intimate . But it 's not that that gets him . It 's the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken , first striking a strand of hair at the woman 's temple , burning it the purple-black of an eggplant , then hitting the man 's left side , so that his shoulder shines with a moist heat that bespeaks all the immediacy of this past day until James is forced to turn his eyes away . <p> The lightning catches him off guard as the storm gathers new force outside . But this time he is n't tempted to huddle behind the heavy chair . The bolts zigzag across the summer sky , aiming for James 's heart . There 's nowhere to hide . <p> <p> By SUZANNE HUNTER BROWN <p>
