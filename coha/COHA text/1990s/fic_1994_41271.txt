BEFORE the radio had even reported the news , Nitza called me from the kibbutz to say that there had been a disaster : three terrorists had sneaked in and barricaded themselves in the children 's nursery . " They ... they 're there right now , " she said , her voice cracking . <p> I swept all the papers off my desk , including the insurance form I was filling in for the new client who sat before me , his eyebrows joined in displeasure . <p> " Is Ilan there , inside ? " I asked . <p> Ilan was our five-year-old boy . He had stayed with Nitza on the kibbutz after we 'd divorced three years before , when I moved back to Tel Aviv . " Y ... yes , " Nitza said , her harsh weeping echoing through the long-distance crackle . <p> " I 'm coming , " I said . <p> I knew I would n't make it in time  --  it was a three-and-a-half-hour drive to Kibbutz Sha'anan , practically on the border with Lebanon  --  but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was my turn to have Ilan , I 'd canceled because I had work to do . <p> " Where you going ? " asked the client . He was an old yekke , a German Jew , who had come to see me about insuring his jewelry store . ( I had opened my agency after leaving the army . ) <p> " I have to go , " I told him . <p> " Now " <p> Without answering I grabbed the car keys and , like an idiot , the .22 Beretta from my desk drawer  --  only later in the car did I notice the magazine was empty  --  and ran out . <p> All the way north I kept thinking that maybe if I drove fast enough I could still get there in time . But when I arrived of course it was all over . <p> Whether the rescue attempt had been botched or whether there was never any chance of success was never made clear , and was anyway irrelevant . From the moment the three terrorists raced through the almond orchard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way in , it almost seemed preordained . Sweeping by him they shouted  --  in Hebrew , no less  --  that they were on a military exercise , and the fool  --  he was returning from guard duty in the avocado field , with a loaded Uzi , two extra magazines , a walkie-talkie , everything  --  let them pass ; even with their Russian RPGs slung in plain sight across their backs , with the green Syrian ammo boxes they were lugging between them as they ran , with the AK-4 Kalashnikovs swinging at their hips , he let them pass . <p> But a minute later there was a shot , and the children started screaming inside the nursery  --  the bastards had killed the teacher , Miriam Goldin , with a single bullet to the head the instant they burst in  --  and by then everyone knew , and all the men on the kibbutz raced pell-mell to the rescue , grabbing whatever they could find : Uzis , Kalashes , MAC-10s , Galils , even rusty Mausers and British Lee Enfields that had been stashed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorists ( no one knew yet how many there were ) had in the meantime barricaded themselves inside the nursery , pushing cribs and beds against the swinging doors , and began shooting out the windows without pause  --  they must have brought thousands of rounds with them . The first to get it was Hanan Berkovitch  --  he rushed forward as if asking for it  --  then Micha Barzel , the manager of the cowshed with whom I used to play ping-pong . And by that time a patrol from the army 's Golani brigade that was in the area , mapping some wadi , took over until the Sayeret , the Recon Commando unit , arrived by helicopter . It had taken them only 40 minutes , I 'll give them that . <p> Later I was told that two of the children had probably died right away when the bastards bound them too tightly , or something  --  they had brought large spools of copper wire and pliers for the purpose . I did n't ask if Ilan was one of the two . What did it matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The moment I saw them , three stooped old men with black skull-caps and flapping black coats through which the fringes of their prayer shawls flickered , I knew ; even before I saw them dragging the small coffins into the nursery , trampling the asters . <p> " Do n't go in ! " Musa Hartov shouted at me . He had been my second-in-command when I left the Sayeret two years earlier . He rushed to my side and grabbed my arm . " I 'm telling you , do n't go in ! " He was still dressed in his black Nomex coverall with the kevlar vest and tight kevlar helmet on his head , looking like a spaceman with all these objects hanging from his back and belt , radios , flares , magazines , syringes , knives , nylon ropes , clusters of grenades . He smelled of cordite and blood , his Patuga canvas boots grimy with blood and brains . <p> I tried to push past him , but he stiff-armed me away . Four medics stumbled by , carrying three soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his neck torn off ; the head lolled to the side , hanging by a thread of skin , the mouth moving . The medic slapped it back onto the stretcher and threw a gray blanket over the three corpses . The crowd of kibbutzniks stood frozen , whispering in shock . Only the crackle of radios and the slow whirr of the copter blades could be heard , and a distant chirp of sprinklers , probably in the avocado fields . <p> Nitza stood a little way off , her red hair flying in all directions , hands to her mouth , with Yossi , that husband of hers , at her side . He was carrying a ridiculously long Nagant , a Russian pistol as long as his thigh and maybe 50 years old . He probably got to the armory last and that was all that was left . The two of them were in their pajamas . They 'd probably been in bed , screwing , when it happened . <p> " I came as soon as I could , " I said . <p> Nitza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , do n't talk to me . <p> Her husband said it had just ended . " They got them , " he said . " Finally . " <p> " But the children ? " I asked . I could n't see how we could talk so quietly . The sun was shining on the wet grass , somewhere a merry tune came from a forgotten radio . The sprinklers still chirped . <p> " Nine of the eleven , " Yossi said . " Nine . Including Ilan . " He began to curse in Arabic , at length . I did n't see what that would accomplish now , cursing . <p> Nitza chose that moment to start screaming , and at the sound of her voice all the other women began to scream , too . I looked at her and all at once , without thinking , I turned around and barged into the nursery , pushing Musa aside . This time he said nothing , and let me pass . <p> The inside of the nursery looked like a broken dollhouse splashed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls . Two unshaven characters looking like hippies , their black T-shirts spattered with dark brown , were slumped against an overturned crib , under a large cardboard drawing of the Evil Haman leading the Virtuous Mordechai on a horse , with Queen Esther looking on . The holiday of Purim was two days away , and the older children had probably made this drawing for the younger ones , for the party . Soon they would have begun making their Purim masks . The two terrorists looked calm , as if sleeping . Gray stuff dripped from their heads . A third was lying face down in the doorway , his head a mass of red and yellowish gray . In the other room the three graybeards were bending over some small heaps . I began moving in their direction but at that moment Musa caught up with me and dragged me back by my belt , with both hands . <p> " Do n't be a donkey , " he hissed . <p> I heard myself ask , " PLF ? " <p> The Palestine Liberation Front had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 miles away . Twice before they had tried to get in , but each time a Golani patrol had gotten them . This time they did n't . <p> " No , PLO . They had their papers on them . " <p> The three old men went by , single file , each carrying a little box . I made to follow but Musa , one hand still at my belt , hit softly at my jaw with the open palm of his other hand , turning my head away . <p> " No , " he said . <p> I said , " I want in on the retribution . " <p> " Do n't be a donkey , " replied Musa , releasing my belt , and he was gone . But in a second he was back . He punched my shoulder , hard . " Goddamn , " he said . " They got three of my guys , too . " <p> Again he grabbed my belt and this time I let him pull me out ; on the way I saw the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were six cardboard boxes , not very large . <p> " I want in , " I said . <p> " They got them with RPGs through the walls . " <p> " I want in . " <p> " Your mother . Once you 're out , you 're out ! " <p> I opened my mouth to argue , but just then the Prime Minister arrived , and the reporters , in two large Super Frelon helicopters , and also a Cobra Medevac with a red Magen David on its tail . The Prime Minister nodded at me , curtly . He used to visit our apartment in Tel Aviv and talk to my father in the kitchen , over a glass of tea . <p> Yaro Peleg , the chief of staff , stood beside the PM . He said , " The bastards got three of ours in the first two minutes , with RPCs . " Someone standing behind said that as usual the terrorists had wanted to bargain : the kids for some imprisoned Fatah guys . " But do n't they know by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The PM asked , " Our guys had these American suits on ? That cost us $500 apiece ? Now look . " He gestured with both hands toward the empty stretchers flapping on the Cobra 's skids , in the rotor 's wash . <p> " They can only stop 7.62 mm , " said the chief of staff , abashed . " Maybe 9 mm . " <p> The PM looked at me . <p> " Yes , " I said . " Maximum . " <p> There was a short pause . The reporters began to inch forward . <p> " How 's your father ? " the Prime Minister asked . <p> " Alive , " I said . " My son got it . " <p> He nodded , his mouth pinched , and immediately turned on his heel and left . He probably knew I was going to ask him the same thing I 'd asked Musa . <p> I did n't get to see Nitza , or Ilan 's body , or any of the other bereaved parents , before I returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes with Yossi , who said he 'd see about everything and would let me know about the funeral . It was painful for both of us , this conversation : the betrayed husband and the new husband , the winning fornicator . But we made the most of it , like civilized people . He brewed some coffee , and I did n't find it in me to refuse . I was amazed how numb I felt . Nine children dead , one of them mine , also three old friends , and the only thing I felt was an odd sort of heat in my stomach , and a tingling in my nose . No tears ; nothing . <p> I asked Yossi , belatedly , whether any of his own children got it . " No , thank God , " he said . " Last month they were transferred to the older children 's house . " His freckled face vibrated as if a fan were blowing air through his skin , from the inside out . <p> " That 's good , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began carrying on with Nitza behind my back while I was away in Egypt or in Jordan , in deep penetrations or ambushes ; two of the children from his first marriage , the twin boys , were still on the kibbutz . The third , a girl , had left with her mother , to live in Haifa . <p> He offered me a bed in the spare room . <p> " No , " I said , " I have to go back . " <p> He did n't even try to persuade me . <p> Back in Tel Aviv I called my father . He was seventy-two then , no longer active in anything , but he still had his contacts in the army , and also in the government , where he was once a minister without portfolio , " minister for shmutz , " as he once put it . Dirty things . <p> " I heard , " he said . " Ilan went . " <p> I said they got them in the end . " But I 'm sure we 'll do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said my father . In his younger days he had been one of the founders of the Sayeret , in a way . <p> " I want in , " I said . <p> " How 's Nitza ? " my father asked . <p> His calm in disasters used to infuriate me , but by now I was used to it . Or maybe I was becoming more like him . It 's not something to be proud of . My only son just got it , and not one tear . <p> " So-so , " I said . <p> " Yossi with her ? " <p> When I did n't answer , he said , " Nu , barukh dayan emet , " blessed be the True Judge . A Jew is supposed to say this when someone dies , to show he 's not mad at God , or anything . <p> I said , " I want in on this . " <p> " Do n't be a donkey , " my father replied . " Leave it to them . " <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want in on this . Call Dada , tell him I want in . " <p> David ( Dada ) Shlomovitz , another Tel Aviv boy , was the current commander of the Sayeret . He 'd been three classes below me in the Alliance high school . Used to play the violin , too , and also soccer . <p> " You go to sleep , Mickey , " my father said . " Tomorrow we 'll both go see Nitza . You want me to drive ? " <p> I said I did n't want him to drive ; I did n't want to see Nitza ; I wanted in on the operation . <p> My father said , " Even if I made the call , they 'd never take you , you know that . You did n't do what you were told the last time . " <p> " This time I 'll do anything , " I said . <p> Two years before , I had left the Sayeret  --  was let go , really  --  after refusing to give the go-ahead in a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan . A local chieftain of the Hezbollah , a good mechanic who specialized in delayed Katyusha rockets . All his sons helped him , all six of them , none older than eleven . We were outside his yard already , but he had three of them sitting in his lap . Maybe he knew we were near . I took everybody back . Two of my guys got it on the way back , from snipers . Finally a sniper of ours , from the Paratroopers Recon unit , got him . <p> " No , " said my father . " You can come here , if you want ; you can sleep in your old bed . " Then he hung up . <p> I called Dada Shlomovitz myself , at his home in Tzahala , north of Tel Aviv , where all the married officers lived . He picked up the phone on the first ring . <p> " It 's Mickey , " I said . <p> " No , " he said . " I talked to Musa . I ... I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few other things  --  about Ilan , and about Nitza , and about how in a month or so he would come see me , if I wanted , when everything was over . In the background I could hear several men 's voices , gruff , curt , talking in low tones . No women . <p> I said , " I speak French , Arabic ; come on , Dada . " <p> " No . I said no . " <p> There was a pause . I knew I was being foolish . This was an open phone line . <p> " Please , " I said . " This one , I have to  --  " <p> He hung up . <p> Next morning my father called . I put my album with old photos of Ilan back in the drawer and we spoke for a while about nothing : the heat , the synagogue where he was now a trustee ( he had inexplicably become religious when my mother died ) , my failing insurance business . Suddenly , out of the blue , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can have more children . " <p> I told him I did n't need his advice . <p> " I talked to Musa , " he said , as if continuing the same line of conversation . " They 're afraid to take you , you never do what you 're told . " <p> What never ? Once . I said , " I 'll swear on the grave of anyone they want . " <p> " I tried , " said my father . <p> I got the keys to my car and drove straight to Tzahala to see Dada Shlomovitz . <p> There was the usual white Subaru with curtained windows parked outside his small villa , under the tzaftzafa trees . As I got out , the door of the Subaru opened and a young Moroccan emerged , his right hand at the back of his belt . He seemed vaguely familiar , although I could n't place him . But he , apparently , knew me . Probably someone from the Shin-Bet with whom I 'd worked on something . There were so many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to . <p> " Oh , shalom , Mickey , " he said , lamely . " I ... I heard about it , about your boy .... You going to see Dada ? " <p> I nodded and climbed the bare concrete steps . The door was n't even locked . Inside the living room were Dada and Musa , talking and waving their hands in the air , and three men : Yaro Peleg , the chief of staff , tall and thickset , and two others , one short and bald , the other tall and curly , both leaning on the wall . Probably shoo-shoo : hush-hush guys from the Shin-Bet or Mossad . New guys . A lot had changed in the last few years , after the foul-up of ' 73 , and I had n't kept in touch . <p> Musa and Dada stopped talking . " What 're you doing here " Dada snapped . <p> I sat down on a chair without being invited . One of the shoo-shoos said , " That 's Mickey Ben-Atar ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's him . <p> " I want in on this , " I said . <p> Another man came through the kitchen door , looked in , and went back to the kitchen . <p> I said , " You 're shy three men now , anyway . " <p> " Four , " Yaro said . " One died an hour ago . " <p> " So you have a few vacancies . " <p> Musa spread his arms wide at Dada , as if to say , I tried , or I told you so . <p> Dada looked at me and shook his head . " There 's no way I ' 11  --  " <p> The phone rang and Yaro picked it up . After grunting into it for a minute he put down the receiver . <p> There was a pause . " What do you want from my life ? " he said to me . <p> " Who was it ? " asked the taller shoo-shoo . <p> " Himself , " said Yaro , looking at me . " Your father called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted in on the operation , like a broken record . <p> The shorter shoo-shoo said maybe I 'd better leave ; I said no , and he said I 'd better , and I said he could try and make me  --  just like two idiot kids in a Tel Aviv schoolyard . " OK , I will , " he said , and Yaro told him to keep his hands to himself , that I was a bereaved father , and other crap like that . There was some shouting between the two shoo-shoo guys and Dada , and then Musa joined in , and the chief of staff too , who said it was up to Dada . At last Dada said , " But you never do what you 're told . " <p> " Once , " I said . " Only once . " <p> I could see I was in , so if they wanted me to grovel , all right , I would grovel . I said I would do anything . <p> " Two guys , " Dada said . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And for what ? For a bunch of lousy baby Arabushim ? They 'll grow up , they 'll get RPGs themselves , for their birthdays . " <p> " I speak Arabic and French , " I said , " if you 're going to Tunis . " <p> " You 're fat now , " Musa said . I could tell I was in . <p> " Your mother is fat , " I said . Now that I was in I could say anything I wanted . <p> " Your mother , " Dada shouted . " Your mother ! You 're not the only bereaved father in the world . " <p> " Yes , " said the shorter shoo-shoo , tightly . <p> There was another pause , of a different quality . <p> " I 'll be at the base tomorrow at noon , " I said . <p> " Tonight , " said Musa . " Your mother , tonight . " <p> The man in the kitchen came in with coffee . Dada said , " Tomorrow , after the funeral , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I saw they were itching to talk about me , so I left . <p> The funeral took place the following day in the small cemetery of Kibbutz Sha'anan . Nine little coffins , none larger than a big ammo box , and three large ones , one for Hanan Berkovitch , one for Micha Barzel , and one for Miriam Goldin . I stood near Nitza all during the service , my father on her other side , Yossi behind her , as if she were liable to bolt and we had to hem her in . Yossi was dressed in his blue air-force uniform with all his medals and campaign decorations . He had been a Mirage pilot . A good one , I 'm told . My father and I were in civilian dress . <p> As the coffins were being lowered into the ground ( a whole Golani platoon was there and they lowered them by rope all at once , on a signal ) , Nitza said , " You going with them , to Tunis ! " <p> I did n't ask how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was no longer with the shoo-shoo herself , but so what . She only had to ask . <p> I hoisted my shoulder , to indicate maybe . <p> " If you want me there , I 'll go too , " she said . <p> " No , no , " my father said . " We have enough people . " <p> Yossi , behind us , said something about keeping our voices down . <p> " Yes , " she said after a while . " I 'm finished with this . You go . " <p> Nitza used to be stationed in the Mossad 's Beirut office . That 's how we 'd met ; on the Beirut coast . She had been in charge of the convoy that was supposed to wait for us at Mua'alamiya beach . I went with the naval commandos , as the Specialist . Nothing came out of that operation  --  intelligence had screwed up , as usual , and the guy we were after , some Libyan with plenty of Qaddafi 's money who was running around trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the night , or maybe to his family ; something . So Nitza and I ended up waiting on the beach until just before dawn , side by side in a cramped overheated Peugeot , talking about jazz and movies and soccer in French in case someone overheard us . She was a kibbutznik , I from Tel Aviv . But she had played the piano when she was young , and I had played the violin , and after a month we were married . It lasted three years . She left the shoo-shoo and returned to the kibbutz after Ilan was born to work in the greenhouses , and I joined , too . But I was rarely home , and soon she began screwing around . In the Mossad it 's no big deal . That 's how they relieve the stress , I 'm told . But I could n't take it , so we got divorced and I returned to Tel Aviv . <p> The funeral took no more than a half-hour . When the cantor finished , the soldiers loaded wooden bullets and fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were walking back to the dining room , Nitza said , " Musa said it 's Abu Salaam , for sure , that it was his operation . " <p> " Probably , " I said . <p> " His son is Arafat 's lover boy , that 's how he got to be chief of operations . " <p> " Well , he 's not bad , " I said , speaking professionally . <p> " No , " she said . " He 's good , the bastard . " <p> Afterward Musa gave me a lift back to the Sayeret 's base near Jerusalem where we would train for the next two weeks . A team of carpenters was already building a mock-up of Abu Salaam 's villa . Like most PLO bigwigs , he lived in Sidi Bousseid , a posh suburb of Tunis , not far from the old port city of Carthage . <p> We divided into two teams . Musa was head of Team B , I of Team A. By then the Mossad had confirmed that the project had indeed been Abu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We trained at night and at odd hours during the day when no satellites were flying overhead . Once my father came by , stayed for the night , watched a whole test-run , had a talk with Dada , then left in the morning without even speaking to me . Whether he was in on the operation , or had just come for a look-see , I could n't tell . He was retired , after all . The PM came too , once , and the chief of staff , but not many others . <p> We were supposed to get into the villa , take the guy down , and be out again in less than 30 seconds . The team that did it fastest without a screw-up would get the commission , the other would play back-up in the street outside . My team won , at 29.6 seconds . <p> Five days before departure , Musa and Dada and I flew into Tunis via Paris and Rome . Someone in the Mossad had picked up a rumor in a Tripoli bar that maybe the Israelis were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check the place ourselves before we brought everybody in , to see if they had beefed up security , if there had been a leak . But there was nothing . We toured the suburb , taking pictures , accompanied by the Tunis Mossad chief and the second-in-command from Paris . It was nice . Trees , shrubs , flowers . The bastards certainly lived it up , what with all the money they extorted from the Saudis and the Kuwaitis . We saw Arafat 's house , and Abu El-Khol 's , the intelligence chief , and the villa of Abu Salaam , a pink stucco shoebox on the corner of a side street with a good view of the sea . We returned to Tel Aviv two days before D-day and went back into training for the final competition . <p> After my team won , Musa took me aside and gave me a little talk . " I 'll be just behind you , " he said . " You hear ? When you see him , do it . " <p> I felt myself going red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were still in high school , " I told him . Then I said a few other things , dredging up all his screw-ups , from basic-training days and even before . <p> But he did n't retreat . " Not like with that sheikh in Lebanon . Children shmildren , women shwomen . You see him , you take him down . " <p> " Sure I 'll take him down , " I said , restraining myself . " What do you think , I 'm going for a picnic ? " <p> " Children they 'll kill here ? " Musa snarled at me , as if I myself had been killing some , a minute ago . " We 'll cut their balls off and stuff them in their mouths , so they 'll know . Children they 'll kill here ? " <p> " Go to sleep , " I said . <p> " No , really . " Musa said . " They want to fight ! Man-to-man ! Okay . But children ? " <p> " Ya'allah , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make with them ? You want to make peace with bastards who kill children ? " <p> " Not me , " I said . <p> At last he went to sleep . Probably angry that his team had lost . <p> We left On a Friday night from Ashdod , the southernmost Mediterranean port in Israel . My father came to see us off , maybe also to see me . He looked lost in his frayed khaki pants and sweat-soaked nylon shirt , among the piles of ammo boxes , dismantled copter parts , irritable naval commandos with their heaps of odd gear , and just plain staff officers from headquarters in Tel Aviv who had come to see the culmination of their plan . There was also the obligatory rabbi who stood to the side , wrapped in a prayer shawl , mumbling into his book . <p> We were 32 men in all on two Dabboor missile boats , one of which carried the dismantled AH-1S Cobra gunship , just in case , its body wrapped in green tarp , the rotors and engine below deck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood , also in case . <p> The sea was calm all the way to Tunis , luckily  --  I always get seasick ; but this time it almost felt like being on the Yarkon river in Tel Aviv , where Nitza and Ilan and I used to take a flat-bottomed dinghy , when we came to visit my father , and row to Seven Mills and back . I had brought a few old letters of Ilan 's  --  from the age of four he used to write to me , in large rounded script , telling me of butterflies , and clouds , and white cows  --  but I had no time to look at them now , on the boat . There was as usual a ton of stuff to check . The black Nomex coveralls with their thousand pockets  --  they tore so easily that each of us had a sewing kit ; the thick kevlar vests , which we had to oil every two hours with green olive oil so they would n't get stiff and squeak ; the special night-vision goggles that would require tuning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  these had to fit , and I had to check everyone 's ; the radios ; the emergency homing devices ; the thousand-and-one weapons  --  Uzis , MAC-10s , Galils , Berettas . We had so much stuff it was ridiculous . I do n't know , in my father 's day , before the ' 48 War of Independence , they used to go into Cairo or Amman with nothing , just an old Arab galabieh , one sharp knife , a pita and olives in their pocket , and come out after a week with the job done . I guess once you have a state everything gets more complicated , even this . <p> There was also a woman on board , a red-headed harridan from the Mossad 's Paris office who came to make a video of the whole thing , for training later . I did n't like this part  --  once I threw up when I saw myself in such a movie , what I had done when I was in the heat of it  --  but there was nothing I could do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least three of the naval commandos en route , maybe even Musa . She reminded me of Nitza . They get so they do n't even think it 's something special . <p> After three days we arrived off Tunis . The coast looked just like the Herzliya beach north of Tel Aviv  --  white , with rolling sand dunes  --  but also with lots of palm trees like in Gaza . The water smelled the same , too , complete with floating turds and condoms . Civilization had come to the Arabs , too . <p> We lolled around just beyond the territorial waters for one more day , until Jerusalem gave final approval . They always do that , arguing about " advisability " to the very last moment . I 'm told this time it was really close  --  some leftist kibbutz ministers got cold feet as usual . It seems there were peace overtures afoot  --  maybe even my father was involved . He used to serve as a go-between in such things , even when he was **26;0;TOOLONG for shmutz , because his word was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be going through the king of Morocco , or so said the Mossad harridan ( these shoo-shoo people always liked to boast how much they knew during operations ) , so a take-down almost on the king 's doorstep would make him look bad . <p> " Make him look bad ? His mother ? " Musa shouted . " Goddamned Arabush . Look bad ? He lets them stay in Rabat , does n't he ? Look bad ? " <p> The Mossad woman said it was all crap anyway . Peace , shmeace . " No one will ever vote for a government that tried to talk to these bastards . Would you vote for them ? People who kill children ? " <p> She addressed first me , then Musa , and without waiting for an answer launched into a political analysis of the next elections , and Musa and I excused ourselves . These Mossad people , once they 've killed , they think they can tell the future , maybe even make it happen . <p> At last we got the green light . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the code word . ) The naval commandos went in first , looking like huge frogs bulging with malignant tumors everywhere , then piled into their ugly gray-black dinghies and rowed ashore ; in about an hour they clicked back their OK . Finally we went in ourselves , in two rubber dinghies , eight men in each . <p> As we detached from the Dabboor boats I pulled out Ilan 's photo and stuck it in the breast pocket of my Nomex coverall . It was a breach of security , but I do n't know , he was my son , and I still had n't cried over him , not even at the funeral . I do n't know if it was because I had turned into a monster who felt nothing any more , like Nitza once said , or maybe simply because the moment Yossi told me the news , I knew I would be in on the retribution and already felt under operational rules . But then , in one way or another , I had been under operational rules ever since I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had been , ever since he had arrived in Palestine , more than a half-century ago . <p> It took us two-and-a-half hours to get to shore  --  we could n't use engines , not even the small electrical ones , so we let the naval commandos tug us in , swimming through the muck with their extra-large flippers on . On the beach at Ras Carthage there was already a short line of cars waiting with Mossad people , all smoking , all trying desperately to appear nonchalant . We got in and drove in VW vans down the coast , 25 miles south to Tunis , and arrived at <p> Abu Salaam 's villa at 1:40 A.M. Then we waited , on a side street , lying on the floor of the vans . Abu Salaam came home an hour later with his wife and son , in a long black Mercedes flying the Palestinian flag . His three bodyguards  --  two Libyans with curly hair , and a huge American black  --  jumped out and spread out in front of the villa , Kalashnikovs at the ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Mercedes into the house , followed by his wife and son . The month before , a splinter faction that had been voted off the Palestine National Council tried to take revenge on him , so I guess he was being extra careful . <p> For an hour after he went in I watched from the van through a little mirror on a stick , waiting for the light to go out in his second-floor window . Every fifteen minutes I clicked once on the radio , and Musa clicked back twice , just to let me know he was there and awake . <p> Although I tried not to , I could n't stop myself from taking out Ilan 's picture . In the dark his face was a mere blur , just as it was in my memory . The last time I had seen him was five weeks before . I 'd been neglecting him lately , mostly because I could n't stand seeing either Nitza or Yossi , how contented they seemed together  --  and also because I was sick of saying no to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , " she said . " He told me so when we got married . In the kibbutz everybody screws on the side . " <p> " Not me , " I said to her . " I 'm from Tel Aviv . " <p> " I thought they screw in Tel Aviv , too , on the side . " <p> " So maybe I do n't know , " I said , meaning I did n't want to know . <p> She was n't the first woman I had known ; but then I did n't know that many . <p> You would think she 'd give up after a while , but no ; she persisted . So after a while I visited as little as possible , maybe once a month . Also I did n't miss Ilan too much . Except in our letters , we never really got along well . He was a brooding child , wild at times , otherwise a silent loner . On more than one occasion we would sit together , drinking boiled milk in the kibbutz dining hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting until it was time for me to go . <p> At 3:50 A.M. the light in Abu Salaam 's bedroom finally went off . I waited five minutes , listening to the silence , then clicked four on the radio  --  go . Musa gave a five-click response , and the vans ' doors slid open . <p> As Musa 's team deployed on the curb , nearly invisible in their light-absorbing Nomex suits , the Mossad girl strolled over to the Mercedes and shot the sleeping driver with a silenced Beretta in the forehead ; then she nodded to us pleasantly , proudly , but we were already racing up the red-tiled stairs of the villa  --  the door had been blown off its hinges with white plastic under a kevlar-styrofoam limpet ( it 's amazing how silent this is )  --  and we were in . I got the two Libyan guards who were dozing in plush green chairs at the foot of the staircase and as we raced up the oak stairs to the second floor ( behind me my second-in-command shot the black American , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bedroom opened and Abu Salaam emerged , his bald head glistening with sweat , a pistol in his hand , a Tokarov . But before he could shoot , a boy rushed out of another bedroom and jumped into his arms , crying . It was his son , a thirteen-year-old blond boy . ( Ilan had been a redhead , like Nitza . ) The boy shouted something in French to his father , who tried to shake him off , shouting something back ; I did n't catch what it was . Intelligence had said the son was Arafat 's catamite , but I do n't know . He looked like just a boy . With freckles , even , and blue-and-white pajamas . <p> Musa 's voice shouted in my earphone , " Take him down , you donkey ! " I felt myself reddening with shame . I was probably a whole five seconds late . I let out a long silenced burst and got them both . Just then his wife appeared in the bedroom door , a small blond with a pinched face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got her . As we raced back down the stairs the Mossad team was already clattering up , with their huge suitcases , for documents . <p> We threw the suitcases and bags into the back of the vans and then the video girl scurried out  --  it emerged later I had only delayed a second-and-a-half , no big deal  --  and we scrammed . The entire thing took maybe 31 seconds , from the moment we blew in the door to the moment the last man left the house , a Mossad louse who had dropped his Beretta . <p> Three days later I rejoined the Sayeret , one rank below what I had before , but who cares . Dada and the guys gave me a little party in his villa , without wives , and after we finished all the Johnny Walker and the Stock 77 we watched the video . I did n't get sick at all , this time . It looked pretty good . Even Musa said so . When Abu Salaam fell off the banister , still clutching the boy , Dada called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , now that we could finally understand each other , and everybody laughed almost to tears , me too . <p> The next day I went back to the kibbutz to tell Nitza . ( She had tried to pull strings to see the video , but the PM had said no . ) Yossi was n't home , so after we finished looking at old photos we screwed on the sofa . It was n't like old times , but it was good enough . Times change , people change , you have to change if you want to live in this place . If you can bring yourself to share your woman , maybe one day you could also let yourself share your land . <p> AVNER MANDELMAN , here making his first appearance in COMMENTARY , is an ex-Israeli writer now living in California . <p>
