The Senate filibuster ai n't what it used to be <p> THE LADY VANISHED .... " I OBJECT , " was all she said before she turned and strode through the swinging doors . Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle called out to the lady , Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison : " Would the senator from Texas wish to state her reason for the objection ? Mr. President , could we get the attention of the senator from Texas ? " But she was gone . <p> Such is the fashion of the filibuster in the modern Senate . No longer does a senator hold the floor in long , impassioned debate , as in the film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington . Now legislators log their filibusters with the leadership , and the Senate pretends to hold them . A senator does n't even need to attend her own filibuster . Her party handles it for her . <p> It used to be more like the movies . Senators delivered seemingly interminable speeches . They taxed their stamina to the limit . They employed clever means to sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor withdraw to answer nature 's call . <p> The indefatigable Senator Strom Thurmond holds the record . In August 1957 , he addressed the Senate for 24 hours and 18 minutes in an effort to halt the advance of civil rights for African Americans . Running a close second , Senator Wayne Morse held the floor for over 22 hours fighting the Tidelands oil bill in 1953 . Senator Robert La Follette Sr. spent almost 19 hours on his feet battling the Aldrich-Vreeland currency bill in 1908 . <p> These somnolent soliloquies earned the Senate a reputation as a tiring place . Former Dean of the House of Representatives Jamie Whitten told how , in the wee hours of the morning , Senator Homer Ferguson once confessed , " Jamie , there are only two ways our Senate can act , either by unanimous consent or exhaustion . " <p> The record for the longest speech of recent years belongs to Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York , who held up a tax bill in October 1992 in a vain bid to save jobs at a Cortland , N.Y. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to do with showmanship than legislation . His performance included singing selections from " Deep in the Heart of Texas " ( for the benefit of Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen , who just wanted to finish his tax bill ) and " South of the Border " ( where the typewriter jobs seemed headed ) . Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times placed it " somewhere between Jimmy Stewart taking on the capital and the final moments of the Jerry Lewis Telethon . ' " <p> Senator D'Amato 's musical revue was the exception to the modern rule . More and more frequently , senators are forgoing the traditional practice of personally holding the floor to delay a vote . Now , senators simply register with their party leader , usually by letter , their objections to the Senate 's proceeding to a mat-ten This objection-called " a hold " - implies the threat of a filibuster should the Senate take up the disputed matter . With the leadership honoring her hold , a senator can be assured that action on the disputed matter will be slowed  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to force a senator to come down to the Senate floor and object in person , as Majority Leader Trent Lott obliged Senator Hutchison to do on the occasion just related . But once Senator Hutchison registered her objection , she felt entirely secure exiting the chamber , relying on her leader to protect her rights  --  in this instance , to block the confirmation of a district court judge in Minnesota . <p> Of course , by choosing not to hold the floor themselves , senators lose some of their influence over the process . In honoring a hold , the party leadership agrees to slow a disputed matter from coming to the floor , but its overriding concerns remain to advance the party 's general interests and to prevent the legislative process from grinding to a halt . ( In Hutchison 's case , the Senate went on to confirm the nominee . ) If the disputed matter affects only one region or interest group , the party may not do much to protect an individual senator . In such instances , the affected legislators may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reid and Richard Bryan of Nevada did in opposing legislation to locate a nuclear waste dump in their state . Still , more and more frequently , senators seem content to sacrifice a litre control for convenience . Stand and Deliver <p> When senators felt compelled to stand and deliver their demurrals , they tended to reserve the filibuster for a deeply held belief . But the modern filibuster , what Senate Parliamentarian Bob Dove calls " the gentleman 's filibuster , " involves so little inconvenience to individual senators that they use k for everything . Now , minor policy disputes readily escalate into filibusters requiring a vote of cloture , creating what Dove calls the " 60-vote Senate " : Any matter about which senators hold any feelings winds up requiting a supermajority of votes . As then-Senator Dan Quayle complained to Congressional Quarterly in 1987 , the Senate has " trivialized " the filibuster . <p> Ending debate by a vote of cloture has also become less cumbersome . To make the trains run on time , in 1975 , then-Majority Whip Robert Byrd pushed through a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a vote of 60 senators . Not surprisingly , the leadership began invoking cloture more frequently . Whereas the Senate conducted 45 roll-call votes on cloture in the entire half-century from 1919 to 1969 , it conducted 99 in the 1970s and 138 in the 1980s . Already , 168 have been conducted in the 1990s . This increase has not gone unnoticed by legislators . Back in 1984 , a select committee on procedure chaired by then-Senator Quayle concluded : " Cloture is not only invoked too often , it is invoked too soon . " <p> At this point , the Senate rarely even bothers with the formal cloture procedure , which allows debate on a disputed bill to continue for 30 hours after the cloture is invoked . Instead , the Senate usually agrees by unanimous consent to hold the final vote at the time convenient to the largest number of senators . Why debate all night when you can not debate and say you did ? This no-fuss objection process has become a favorite tool for partisan disruption . This summer , the minimum wage bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a small-business tax cut bill were all locked together for a time like so many scorpions in a death grip of objections . During the previous Congress , Republicans successfully employed filibusters to block several Clinton initiatives , notably campaign finance and health care reform . Democrats tried the same in the 1980s . <p> This being an election year , the threat of filibusters has been especially popular in putting the brakes on the confirmation of judges and other appointed officials . No majority leader wants to spend the several days that calling a senator 's bluff  --  or enduring an actual filibuster  --  would take simply to confirm a judge , especially one nominated by the president of another party . In effect , the Senate has raised the bar for appointment to many high offices to near unanimous approval from a club that includes  --  truth to tell  --  at least a few eccentric members . To his credit , Majority Leader Lott tried to march the Senate through a number of nominations , but occasionally ran into resistance , as with Senator Hutchison . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At times , the intimation of such a delay is enough to get people talking . This summer , Senator Ted Kennedy used the threat of a filibuster to alter the Kennedy-Kassebaum health insurance bill . Making only a few explanatory speeches of reasonable length , and with the cooperation of his party 's leadership , Senator Kennedy held up the appointment of conferees in order to negotiate differences between the House and Senate bills . He thus extracted from the Republican leadership a commitment that the final bill would contain a much more modest experiment on tax-subsidized medical savings accounts than Republicans wanted . <p> Still , the filibuster madness often frustrates senators . In mid-July , Majority Leader Lott complained bitterly at his news briefings of " slow-rolling gridlock " and " absolute gridlock . " This increased frustration further erodes the Senate 's storied comity . Perceiving less comity , a senator is more likely to throw a filibuster into the works of another senator 's legislative dream . And so the Senate descends into a spiral of bitterness . <p> Frequent filibustering also frustrates voters . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority leaders like Bob Dole , Robert Byrd , and George Mitchell . When the Senate can not enact the majority party 's legislative agenda , the public questions the majority 's competence or  --  worse yet  --  its sincere desire to get anything done . Without the accompanying oratories of explanation , the delays caused by gentleman 's filibusters can seem pointlessly disruptive to the general public , and the Senate 's workings become even less understandable to observers ( which , thanks to C-Span , constitute more and more Americans ) . The public 's cynicism grows because of the incomprehensible nature of the legislative process . Cloture Clots <p> Several legislators have proposed changing the system . Senator Ron Wyden has made the modest proposal that senators be required to publicly acknowledge the holds they place . Majority Leader Lott is considering the proposal , but do n't hold your breath . <p> Senator Quayle 's 1984 committee recommended making it possible to end a filibuster simply on the motion to proceed . The 1993 Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress endorsed the proposal , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is out of control , " Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa proposed a sliding-scale cloture rule not unlike the pricing practices at clothing stores . The longer the Senate stayed on a matter , the fewer votes cloture would require . The Senate rejected Senator Harkin 's amendment by a 76-to-19 vote . The change most likely to curb the filibuster is the expansion of the budget process . Early in the 1980s and again this year , the majority . stretched the budget process  --  which has time limits and thus immunity from filibustering  --  to cover nonbudgetary matters . That 's how Congress enacted a Republican-leaning welfare reform bill this year . And this year 's budget blueprint contemplated using the fast-track budget process for tax cuts . <p> While aimed at curbing abuses , these incursions on the filibuster threaten an important tool . For all its inconveniences , the filibuster serves useful purposes . Most significantly , it empowers organized minority parties and coalitions . Senator Byrd , who has stood on both the giving and receiving end of many a filibuster , writes in his Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government where the perfection of laws may be unhurried and where controversial decisions may be hammered out on the anvil of lengthy debate . The liberties of a free people will always be safe where a forum exists in which open and unlimited debate is allowed . <p> Maybe what we need is more debate , not less . Bring the decision making out of the back rooms and onto the Senate floor . Let the public see what all the deliberations and delays are about . Senators should be compelled once more to stand up , literally , for their convictions . Organized minorities certainly deserve a forum for objections , but the process should not be so simple it invites abuse . As with any freedom , misuse will lead to frustration and anger , resulting in misguided " reforms " that endanger the freedom itself . And senators ' freedom to filibuster may at times preserve freedoms for us all . <p> BY BILL DAUSTER <p> <p> BILL DAUSTER is the Senate Budget Committee 's Democratic Chief of Staff . <p>       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
