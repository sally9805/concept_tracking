<p> He is a multi-millionaire , but even Frank Lorenzo fumes about high airfares when he 's paying for the ticket . <p> " The consumer is being had , " says the 52-year-old former chairman of Continental and Eastern airlines . He says he recently asked his secretary to book him a flight on short notice between Boston and Baltimore . " The fare was $ 500 . I said forget it , I did n't take the trip . " <p> The way Lorenzo sees it , the major airlines ' costs have gotten too high , which in turn has forced them to raise fares to levels people ca n't afford . He says the problem is particularly acute on the East Coast . As fares have climbed , traffic has stopped growing or fallen . Yet , in the West , where low-fare airline Southwest has been expanding , traffic has been growing , he says . " It 's dramatic . " <p> Hence the opportunity for a new East Coast airline . " The consumer is being choked , " Lorenzo says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he stepped down as chairman of Continental Airlines for a low-profile careeer as a private investor , he is seeking a new role in the business he 's spent 30 years in . <p> The man who commanded what was briefly the USA 's biggest airline company now owns 60% of a tiny start-up venture called Friendship Airlines . If the Department of Transportation grants it an operating certificate , Friendship will fly between Boston , the Washington area and Orlando . It will be a full service airline , but its fares will be 25% lower than what 's being charged now . Lorenzo will be a director , but other airline executives will run it . <p> If anyone else were involved , DOT approval might be a slam dunk . But controversy dogs Frank Lorenzo like a determined hound on a fox 's trail . The DOT 's review of Friendship 's application - and its fitness to comply with aviation laws - is shaping up as a debate on Frank Lorenzo 's airline record . " We look at everything Frank Lorenzo has done , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babbitt , president of the Air Line Pilots Assocation , the USA 's biggest pilots union . <p> The big question for some is why would Lorenzo wants to do it . It 's not like he needs the money . When he left Continental , he sold his stake in the airline for $ 30 million . <p> It 's not like he needs the publicity , either . He 's been called everything from Darth Vader to airline world 's man of destiny . A Fortune magazine cover story once proclaimed him the USA 's toughest boss . Labor unions made him their poster boy , plastering his name on bumper stickers , buttons and posters - inside a slash-in-a-circle symbol . <p> In some ways , his airlines reflected the best and worst of deregulation . In the 1980s , Lorenzo 's Peanut Fares , MaxSaver fares and other promotions helped make flying affordable for millions of fliers . But in forging a major airline company out of a half dozen ailing airlines , Lorenzo also left behind a lot of dissatisfied employees , disgruntled fliers and disenchanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hassles again ? Maybe it 's ego . Or maybe it 's doing what you know best . " I happen to believe the airline business today is one of the most misunderstood businesses with some of the most attractive economic opportunities , " he says . <p> While Lorenzo looks ahead , his opponents are looking back at his airlines ' record . Continental Airlines , which Lorenzo bought in 1981 , is on the verge of completing its second bankruptcy reorganization in 10 years . Eastern - which Lorenzo 's Texas Air company bought in 1986 - is out of business . Labor unions resent Lorenzo for breaking Continental union contracts by placing the airline in Chapter 11 the first time . Some analysts consider the bitter labor-management feuds at Eastern under Texas Air a contributing factor in that airline 's demise . <p> " When you look at the bankruptcy of two airlines in which Mr. Lorenzo had substantial control , the safety violations of Eastern ... you 've got to wonder whether we want to encourage or even allow his re-entry into the business , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vow to fight Friendship Airlines ' DOT application . Their allies include more than 50 members of Congress who have asked Transportation Secretary Federico Pena to reject the application because of Lorenzo 's role . <p> The campaign frustrates Lorenzo , who believes his record is being distorted . " ALPA and the unions have thrown around lies . We have not done a good job of countering them over the years , " he says . <p> In an interview at a private club in Washington , he looks relaxed and less haggard than he did when he stepped down as chairman of Continental in Aug. 1990 . He owns an investment firm now - Savoy Capital in Houston . Its investments include a Washington restaurant and tourist-related businesses in Mexico . But Lorenzo shows he still has a passion for the industry he joined 30 years ago as a TWA financial analyst . <p> And he wants to set the record straight : The unions did not drive him from the business . In 1990 , he did say he was resigning for the good of the company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now Lorenzo says he had financial reasons too . He 'd seen a recession coming and he had already seen Continental 's stock slide from $ 50 a share to $ 15 . " I wanted to protect my nest egg , " says Lorenzo , who was a major shareholder in Continental . Scandinavian airline SAS bought out him and some associates for $ 30 million . <p> Continental filed for Chapter 11 four months later . Lorenzo blames the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait , which sent fuel prices soaring in late 1990 . " I left a company that was essentially breaking even , " he says . " I did not leave a tottering company . " <p> Another point raised against him is Eastern 's 1991 guilty plea to seven counts of criminal fraud related to a coverup of aircraft maintenance repairs that had n't been done . Lorenzo 's response : He did n't know about the maintenance violations that occurred during his company 's control of Eastern nor should he be held responsible . <p> " I have a safety record in this business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one jet accident - that 's one too many - but I had one jet accident in 19 years , " he says . " To think I would n't do everything in my power to have the strongest maintenance operation is just a blatant lie . " <p> " If you 're telling me the CEO ( Lorenzo ) did n't know about it , he ought to be put in jail , " says Babbit . " And if he did know about it , he should be put in jail . " <p> Lorenzo has supporters , too . Airline consultant Morten Beyer says Lorenzo rescued Texas International , saved Continental from liquidation and kept Eastern alive when no one else would . " Frank Lorenzo has been the greatest builder of airlines this country has ever seen , " he says . <p> He should not be blamed for the demise of Eastern , says Kenneth Quinn , an ex-DOT lawyer and former FAA general counsel . " Eastern was in a sorry state prior to , during and after Frank Lorenzo , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application for weeks or months . If Friendship can pass the government 's safety rules , Lorenzo says the public should decide whether to support a Lorenzo-financed airline . ' I put millions of dollars at risk here because I believe in the American public 's need for this product - and I believe in the people doing this deal , " he says . " Let the American public get a reasonable chance to decide . "
