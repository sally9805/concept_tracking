The funeral last week of the last Czar of Russia and his family , held in the austerely beautiful confines of St. Petersburg 's Peter and Paul Fortress , was originally intended to be an act of national repentance for 80 years of death and division . It turned out to be a symbol of the dominant feature of Russian politics today : the fine art of cutting a deal . <P> For the priests and the President in the cathedral last Friday , the small coffins in front of them were not those of Nicholas II , his wife , three of his children and four faithful retainers . ( The remains of two children , Alexei and Maria , have yet to be found . ) In the view of the church , the boxes draped with the imperial flag contained the skeletons of anonymous victims of the political terror that engulfed Russia after the overthrow of autocracy in 1917 . The head of the Russian Orthodox Church , Alexi II , who has been accused by former dissidents of collaboration with the Soviet-era KGB , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive DNA tests . He calls them the " Yekaterinburg remains , " a reference to the town in the Urals where the imperial family was killed in the early hours of July 17 , 1918 . President Boris Yeltsin  --  who as Communist Party chief there in 1977 had destroyed the site of the massacre  --  denounced the murder during his funeral address but stuck to the official church description of the remains as innocent and unnamed victims . <P> Yeltsin 's mere presence at the rites was an unexpected act of political daring . The idea of national repentance for the murders was dropped months ago after the Patriarch withheld his blessing , and most leading politicians , with the exception of the ambitious Alexander Lebed and opposition leader Grigori Yavlinsky , found other things to do that Friday . Yeltsin 's sudden decision to appear achieved the effect he so clearly enjoys , catching his rivals off balance and making them look foolish . This time , however , his about-face may have been inspired by more profound considerations . The day before the funeral , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 91 , spoke on the phone with the President and urged him to attend . Yeltsin is reputed to be in awe of Likhachev , a specialist in early Russian literature and a survivor of one of the worst of the early Soviet political prisons , where in previous centuries the Orthodox Church sent its dissidents . Soon after the call , Yeltsin announced he would travel to St. Petersburg , and during the ceremony Likhachev stood just behind the President . <P> Surviving members of the Romanov family  --  who had come from addresses as diverse as Paris ; Oakland , Calif. ; New South Wales ; and East Sussex  --  kept a low profile . Those who spoke Russian did so in an archaic St. Petersburg accent that has all but disappeared . Some , such as the mayor of Palm Beach , Fla. , Paul Ilinsky , never learned the language . They were restrained in their comments on Nicholas and made no claim to any stake in Russia 's political future .               @ @ @ @ @ @
