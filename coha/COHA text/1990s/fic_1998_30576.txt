He could n't get himself arrested At 7:30 A.M. , Barry Cantor flew up the Saw Mill River Parkway blasting Abbey Road . It was five days before Christmas . He had n't had a second date in eight months , and he had n't had sex in over a year . It was astounding . Barry worked , read the Times , watched TV ; he played first base for the Condiments and Retail Sauces team . At 32 , he 'd won a Brammy for Best Consumer Promotion . At 33 he 'd renovated the twisty seven-room apartment he 'd grown up in . Three months ago , he 'd hired a chef to cook for him twice a week . If he behaved himself , he 'd be Group Product Supervisor in a year . In all probability , he would never learn Italian ; when he was honest with himself , he admitted that he did n't really speak French . He took the second Tarrytown exit . All of Barry 's old friends were married , and most of them were fathers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying things . Possibly there was something wrong with him . He 'd been losing hair steadily since his junior year at Dartmouth . On the other hand , he was taller than most men he knew . Plus , there was something seriously wrong with every single woman he 'd met lately . Jack Kennedy did n't get married until he was 36 . He turned into the ice-encrusted parking lot , sick of thinking about himself . It was as if Cynthia had never existed , as if he 'd never had someone sleeping next to him . And why would it ever end ? Nobody wanted anything anymore . Not true : Vince Anspacher was seeing three women simultaneously . Barry had been fascinated by Vince 's situation until he 'd met Vince 's lineup  --  neurotic , abrasive , and self-involved , every single oneoffices were trembling under the weight of all the garlands , lights , and desktop nativity scenes . Every year , it started earlier . Every year , it made Barry sick . Maggie Fahey , an astonishingly beautiful Assistant Product Manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a single word . " Top o ' the marnin to ya , lass , " he called after her . She raised her coffee without turning around by way of greeting . Very nice . He could n't get himself arrested . Barry kibitzed a little with the coffee guy , who always had his large/light/three sugars bagged before he 'd reached the counter . He loved the coffee guy . He took the holly-decked elevator to 5 , strode down the hall , and nearly collided with some people who were sucking up to John Rheinecker , Senior VP for marketing and the man behind the Susie Strudel relaunch , which was widely regarded as nothing short of brilliant . Barry hated watching people grovel for Rheinecker and he hated Rheinecker for enjoying it . " Morning , Cantor , " Rheinecker said in a dry , disdainful fashion without eye contact . His face had the color and sheen of pink grapefruit skin . " Your Grace , " Barry said , and pivoted into his office . So he had a problem with authority . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday 's trauma : the Council had decided to sell Peggy 's Pickles , a beautiful little brand with a loyal following in New England . No reflection on Barry 's management , but still , it grated on him . Emily King , his putative assistant , was n't around . He flicked the lid off his coffee . The Maplewood Acres Morale Survey was still on his desk , blank . The anonymity clause at the top was bullshit  --  they had everything coded . Everybody else had returned it imme diately , lying robotically ( the required seminar on e-mail etiquette was very important , the dental plan was very generous ) . If you 'd told Barry ten years ago that he 'd be thinking twice about voicing honest criticism , he 'd have laughed out loud . And yet : Henry Ford did n't form the Detroit Automobile Company until he was 36 , did n't form the Ford Motor Company until he was 40 , did n't release the Model T until he was 45 . Of course , George Gershwin was dead at 39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still : Gershwin had women flocking around him constantly . Barry combed through the latest Nielsen numbers for Parson 's Creek Salad Dressings . Dijon Garlic had taken a nose dive nationwide in August . Caesar With Bacon was doing a respectable business in the Rochester test market . His phone rang . " Do n't lend your father money , " his mother rasped . " But he 's my father , " Barry said , feeling the floor dropping away . Two years ago he 'd given Ira $7,000 to tide him over till the insurance paid when his boat was shredded in Hurricane Carl . In his heart of hearts , Barry knew Ira did n't have insurance , even though he 'd been kvetching about the bureaucracy , the volumes of paperwork , the mental hygiene of the inspectors . " Fine . Go ahead , " Rose said . " You 'll never see it again . " His parents had been divorced for twenty-one years . Rose continued to run her coat-lining business in a dingy factory on 36th Street . His father lived on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who used to clean his menswear store before his second bankruptcy . " He 's got some nerve asking you , " he said . " He asked your sister . She just called me . " Barry made a mental note to chew out Karen for telling Rose . " Look , I 'll see you tonight , " she shouted over the din . " I 'm short two shipments of thread . I got ta clear it up before I get on the plane . " Barry strolled across the floor to his immediate supervisor , William Plast . " Good weekend ? " he asked at the threshold . " Cleaned out the garage , " Plast said , with morose satisfaction , motioning him inside . " Took the kids to the church auction . You ? " Barry sat in Plast 's guest chair , causing a Wise Man to topple off the credenza . " Watched the golf . " Barry said , picking the figurine up and replacing him in the manger . " Ah , the good old days , " Plast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could just sit and watch the golf . " They began chatting about the year in salad dressings . Barry had also attended his college roommate 's second wedding alone , and was snubbed by a stout , frosted blonde who could n't have been under 40 . This was the longest period of celibacy recorded outside Franciscan cloisters . Maybe when he got home that night , he should just walk across the hall to the Divorce 's apartment and present himself . Barry Cantor : Convenience . Amusement . Discretion . But he could n't fuck around anymore . He 'd had plenty of intrigue in his life , but other than Cynthia , nothing had ever really gotten beyond preliminary hostilities . Pointing to the Dijon Garlic visuals , Plast said , " Is there a way of enhancing the drama of the drop ? " " Why would I want to do that ? " " To draw attention to it . " " Why would I want to do that ? " Plast looked as if he 'd caught Barry cheating on a math test . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped like a pudgy football , and had all the spontaneity and liveliness of cold oatmeal . The idea that Plast was getting laid regularly made Barry furious . " Look , we 're not gon na get more promotion money next year by dropping our pants and asking Rheinecker for a whack . " Stu Eberhart passed by and Plast knocked over his wastebasket jumping to attention . Barry was always surprised at how small the CEO was . Tiny little guy , maybe five one or two . Since becoming CEO , he 'd survived a triple bypass , and Rheinecker 's maneuverings for his job . Three years ago , Eberhart had traded in his wife of 28 years for a newer model of the same kind of tootsed-up , suburban ash blonde . Last year , the second Mrs. Eberhart had sprung a serious new chest . Plast turned his attention to Barry 's coupon design . " I do n't like the burst behind ' Save 50 cents , ' " he said sadly . He had a fat simpering wife who agreed with his every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , " Barry sighed . He missed John Hearne . Hearne was the best boss he 'd ever had . No : the only good one . Operating as a team , without formalities , they 'd pumped up Maplewood Jam by 13 percent in two years . When Barry was promoted to Product Manager , Hearne was picked to start a low-cholesterol frozen entres division . Since Eberhart 's bypass , Hearne had a virtual green light on every line extension . " I like a circle , not a burst , " Plast said finally . " And let 's do it horizontal , the way we usually do it . It works . " When Barry strolled back across the floor , Emily King was batting around in her cubicle . About a month ago , a tension had blossomed when he asked her to have a drink , which she 'd misinterpreted . Like he was interested in this whiny , horse-faced incompetent ? The thing had blossomed when she told him her sister was training to become a midwife , and he 'd said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It turned out that she , Emily , was also training to become a midwife . Did she even have a sister ? Emily : preposterous . " Please check these numbers , " Barry said , and gave her the Nielsens when she walked into his office . " I 'll need them by lunch . " She glared at him in impudence , submission , and self-loathing . " How the hell am I supposed to do that by lunch ? " " Come in by 9 like everybody else ? " She suppressed whatever she was going to say , took the discs and flounced  --  yes , flounced was the word  --  off to her cubicle . She still had her coat on : he should n't see her dingy , stringy body . Lord , was she a pain in the ass . He trotted down to John Hearne 's office . " My assistant has PMS four weeks a month , " Barry began , and put his feet up on Hearne 's desk , causing a flock of greeting cards to flutter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards . " My boss spent his weekend fiddling around with my coupon . My roommate has female guests and leaves his door open . They 're selling my pickles , " he added , replacing the cards one by one in a line on the desk . " Should I be taking any of this personal ? " " No , " Hearne said reasonably , with a look of frank amusement . " But show a little fear with the generals , Barry . They 'll love you for it , " he added , like a salesman . " Uch , " Barry said , and walked . Ever since they 'd met , Hearne had been Barry 's advance man in life . Hearne was one of the few people at the company who gave Barry hope . But the morale survey had been Hearne 's idea , and Hearne was too deluded to see they were using it for intelligence gathering and mind control . And last week , Barry had heard the man speaking to his wife in a tone he would n't have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been wrong about Hearne . When he came back upstairs , Emily was deeply immersed in a tte -- tte with the luscious Maggie Fahey in the tinsel-decked pantry . " I put a big piece of quartz on my heart , " Emily said , in a self-pitying tone . She was wearing a red felt Santa pin on her flat chest . " I sing to my crystals , " Maggie said proudly . " It felt good , weighing down , because my heart was already heavy , " Emily said , tragically . " And pink is a healing color . " " I hate to interrupt this beautiful moment  --  " Barry began , but they took no notice of him . " I have some that I wear , " Maggie continued , " and some others that I keep by the window , so they get air . " "  --  but I really need those numbers pronto if I 'm going to make my plane . " If he left for the airport by two , he 'd miss Quality Control singing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at him as if he 'd torn skin off her heart , and stalked out like an insulted starlet on a nighttime soap . " Talk about bad energy , " Maggie said , in disgust . Some days , Barry was reminded of Jeff Keeley , a PM on Raisin Bread who 'd been dismissed after being observed relieving himself in the white-paper recycling bucket . And then there was the legendary Gary Tobias : fired after he exploded at a Beverage Review , calling Rheinecker an asshole for nixing his coffee soda idea . For Barry , there were your Keeley days and your Tobias days . Really , Emily had to go . LaGuardia was swarming with harassed December travelers . Barry hated the holidays . The crowds , the forced sentiment , the retail pressure , the buildup , the letdown , the crap all o ver the buildings . Every year , he went to Miami Beach for the antidote , a dose of hot air and cranky Jews , and that made him sick too . In a few hours , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crisscrossed with lines of gnarled blue knots  --  by the pool . He was n't looking forward to it . The idea that he might meet someone there rather than here was laughable , but he kept his mind open just the same . Every year . There was an exquisite woman on line in front of Barry . She had dense , sculpted black eyebrows and short straight black hair with bangs . She was in a neat black coat . She had matching , clean-looking luggage . He was falling in love with the back of her head , where her hair was shorn into an emphatic point that held his attention . Her left hand was in her pocket . He stared at the curving point . What do you say to such a woman  --  I 'm Barry : Fly me ? While he was debating this , inwardly cursing himself as a coward , she glided up to the counter . She wanted to upgrade to first class with frequent flier miles and she stood with her body pressed into the chest-high partition . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand was still in her pocket . She was going to Phoenix at 3:45 . She turned around and gazed at him . She was vivid , she was dark . " We were married in a previous life , " the look said . " Do n't you feel it ? " She got what she wanted . She hoisted her bags and gave him a look that said , " I was n't looking at you before ; moreover , I 'm from Park Avenue , so do n't fuck with me . " She disappeared beyond a pack of misbehaving kids , but he caught sight of her again as she rose through the ceiling on an escalator . Was it too much to hope that this woman , whom he loved , yes , loved , would give him a backward glance ? The airport was throbbing . His heart was simultaneously knocking in his throat and his stomach . She was looking down at him . It was his turn on line . " I want to change this to the 3:45 Phoenix flight , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a nonrefundable ticket . " " It 's a free country , I 'll buy a new one , " he snapped  --  the flight left in sixteen minutes and his wife from a previous life was escalating away . The clerk looked up . " Coach or first class . " " First class . " Barry leaned in confidentially . " I want to sit next to that woman just now with the frequent flier miles . " The pasty clerk looked up sharply with his eyes . " I know , but I 'm a nice guy , " Barry pleaded . " I 've never done this before . " The clerk was clacking away on his keyboard  --  what did that mean ? Would he have to explain his love to this man 's superior ? " Across the aisle , then . " He dared not look around . " Please ! I 'm giving you twice the business here . " " She 's in 3A . You 're in 3B . You 're perfect together , " the WorldWide clerk said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the gate with serious energy . There was nothing he could n't do . When he arrived at his seat , she was arranging belongings . " Hi , " he said briefly , as if to be polite . 3A looked at him in wild disbelief , and then busied herself among her bags , taking out volumes of reading material . He took out his own volumes , as a sign that he would n't bother her . When they were both settled , he chanced a direct look . She gave him a polite , closed-mouth grimace of a smile , and gazed out the window . That was okay . It was a long way to Phoenix ; she 'd have to use the bathroom sometime . In the meantime , the excitement had ebbed . It was nice just sitting next to her . She was somewhere between 28 and 38 . Perfect . She smelled like hyacinths , tangerines , pencil shavings  --  strong , strange . " Ow moy Gawd , " a man behind him said , and rocked Barry 's seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horror show when she opened her mouth . It would serve him right . An ugly stewardess arrived to ask what they wanted to drink before takeoff . " Tomato juice , please , " she said , " no ice . " Unplaceable accent , lovely voice . " Ginger ale for me ! " he said , with growing confidence . He pretended to read Progressive Grocer . He would invite this woman to dinner at his home with his personal chef . This would impress her . Last night , for example , when Barry got home , Pippa was n't around , but the place smelled fabulous . There was homemade minestrone on the stove and a moldy-looking cheese laid out on a board . He tried it . It tasted like the dusty concrete floor in a dank French basement . He was in heaven . " I saw the most amazing film , " Pippa had said when she walked in with his dry cleaning . " Did you ever see it ? The Deer Hunter ? " " Oh , I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Her skin was bad , her eye makeup was runny , and her hair was a nightmare . There was a frazzled , undiscriminating energy about Pippa , and five weeks earlier , when she 'd come to audition with a meal , he 'd looked at the leather jacket and the Day-Glo orange hair , and wondered if she was on drugs . But her eyes were a lively vaporous blue , and she smiled when she talked . She did n't stop talking . She was a junior at Columbia , torn between law and architecture . She 'd been Type A , but now she was n't sure . " Wow , what a crowd , " she 'd cracked , nodding at two plates in an otherwise empty cabinet . Barry was mad at himself for thinking drugs ; he was getting middle-aged , for Christ 's sake . She was a pretty person going through an awkward period . The food was fantastic  --  he could n't have been more surprised . He 'd hired her on the spot , canceling appointments with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Times . This woman in 3A looked like she liked to eat . He would invite her to dinner and ask Pippa to make something spectacular . She 'd made napoleons from scratch one night her second week . He 'd watched her rolling the dough out with a rolling pin . He did n't even know he owned a rolling pin . " So , you 're Jewish , " his chef said , with an overcasual air , tossing flour across the dough . The eternal issue . " Yes ma'am , I am . " She was pretending to read her cookbook . " And Vince ? " " Vince is half Jewish . The worst kind : he thinks he 's better than everybody . " He watched her digesting the information . " And you ? " " I 'm nothing . So Vince 's dad is like a big important  --  " " But Christian nothing , right ? " he interrupted . " My father was Catholic and my mother was Presbyterian , " she said , picking up the square of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different direction . " They became Quakers in college and against anything organized afterwards . " Vince was wandering around in a bathrobe with a glass of Scotch . He looked like a duke 's son dissipating himself at Oxford in a PBS miniseries . Pippa scooted around him shyly . She had a crush on Vince . It was irritating . " So , " Barry asked him . " How 's tricks ? " Vince 's eyes half closed . " Have you thought about cle aring the decks ? Being alone for a while , to figure out what you want ? " " Alone , " Vince said , as if it were a foreign word . " I do n't think I 've been alone for more than "  --  he paused in thought  --  " a week since I was 17 . " What an extraordinary statement . " Well then , clearly you need to try it . " " Has it worked for you , " Vince asked , bored . " Now , now , it 's not nice to make fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pippa was blushing at the sink as she brushed melted butter onto the pastry dough . So what , Vince was connected and rich and good-looking . He was a prick . " Do these women know about each other ? " " Not specifically , " Vince yawned , and sat at the table . " They know I date other women . They 're all seeing other guys . " " Laura 's number one , right ? " Barry asked . Vince shrugged . " Does n't it bother you that she 's seeing other guys ? Let me be clear : when we say seeing , we do mean screwing  --  yes ? " Vince turned his palms up on the table . " Yes . " " And that does n't bother you ? " " Well , I do n't want to watch her do it , but no , not really . " Astonishing . There are only two kinds of situations a man can handle : very serious or purely sexual . Anything in between and you 're in trouble . Vince was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just coast with a girl while she was around . He , Barry , could n't bear to spend even an evening with someone who did n't have end-game potential . When the pre-takeoff drinks arrived , Barry turned to 3A and said , " L'Chaim . " She gave him another disbelieving glance . What was with the disbelieving glances ? Get over it , Girl : I am sitting next to you and we are going to Phoenix ! What he would do when he got there , he had no idea . He went back to Pro gressive Grocer . Everyone said that it happened when you least expected it . Barry was 34 years old and he had n't even kissed a woman in ten months . So how could he not expect it ? He was the only man at Maplewood Acres over 27 who was n't married , with the exception of Bob Stenglis , head of Beverages , who was queerer than a $3 bill . Even Cynthia had gotten married . The woman next to him was making notes in the margins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that portend ? He tried to calm himself . He tried to contain his expectations . But he missed the multiformat evening where there was food , entertainment , and then going home and getting naked . Barry missed talking . Was this really too much to ask ? Both he and his intended ignored the stewardess 's safety routine . What if she lived in Phoenix ? The plane skittered off to a bad start ; Barry felt his stomach drop . The woman leaned back with eyes closed . She was wearing earplugs . What the hell was he doing ? He 'd signed for the ticket without even looking at it . How much had this date cost ? The plane was tilting and shuddering as it ascended . Long distance was not an attractive option at this stage of his life , even if she was terrific in bed . Everything dropped suddenly ; there was an audible , cabin-wide gasp as the plane pitched and a grinding rattle started . 3A sat forward , took out the earplugs , and held them tightly in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the windows next to her . Everyone was alert , looking around . " Captain Don Baker has informed me , " the stewardess came over the speaker , " that we are experiencing some turbulence . Please sit back with your seat belt fastened and we wish to remind you again that there is no smoking anywhere on this flight , and there are smoke detectors in the lavatories , and tampering with a smoke detector is a federal crime subject to penalty and fine . " The lurching and the terrible grinding rattle continued . Was he going to die on this plane ? Not possible . There were often bad moments , but the plane always came through . Always . Barry slipped his airsick bag out just to have it handy . Throwing up on his dream girl could not be his last act before dying . The speaker thundered , " SIT DOWN ! 29D , SIT DOWN ! " Barry and the woman exchanged wordless , petrified eye contact . A smell like garlic wafted through the cabin ; the plane seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this , " she said , in a low voice . Her teeth were curvy and unnaturally white . " Me too , " Barry said , and without really thinking about it , he put his hand out on the drink rest between them . She put her frozen hand in his . They laced fingers . She had the loveliest brown eyes . He could n't possibly die yet . The pilot announced in an explosion of static that they would be returning to LaGuardia . " Fly ! " he heard himself barking . " Do n't talk , fly ! " The plane pressed up again , turning sharply to the right . When the about-face was completed , the grinding stopped . There was an absolute , terrible , plane-wide silence . The plane began to fall . Barry found himself stepping on the gas . The woman , ashen , let go his hand and grabbed at the seat in front of her . He handed her his airsick bag and she heaved , neatly , behind the sharp pleats of white plastic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he would live long enough to touch the point on the back of her neck . &lt; P&gt;He touched it , and she made a terrible face and heaved again into the bag . The plane plummeted and there was fear in his mouth . The stewardess began barking over the speaker , demanding calm , sounding terrified herself . The man behind them chanted , " OW MOY GAWD , OW MOY GAWD , OW MOY GAWD ! " Barry smelled smoke and burning hair . The plane was on fire ? The woman handed him the airsick bag and he threw up on top of whatever she had thrown up ; the idea of it made him retch again . He sat back , sweating . She handed him a Wash'n Dri . He was too weak to take it . Land was appearing and disappearing in the windows . His heart was pelting his ribs . She opened the Wash'n Dri for him . He wiped his mouth and sweating forehead . The lights went out . He was going to die now . And all because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him with luminous eyes . He grabbed her and they braced their arms around each other tightly . The pilot said that he was attempting an emergency landing . " Just fly the fucking plane , Jack , " Barry shouted , and at this the woman laughed , and turned her face to him and kissed him flush on the mouth . Her lips were soft , and she tasted of vomit acid ; he supposed he did too . Noxious fluids were part of life too . There was another lurch , and Barry almost threw up again , almost threw up in this beautiful woman 's mouth . He tried to stabilize , but he had no idea what was happening . " Justine Schiff , " she said , and squeezed his right hand so fiercely he gasped . The stewardess demanded a tuck position . They bent over their knees ; the pressure from his seat belt was intolerable . The plane was fighting up again ; he felt it like a creepy vibration in his lower back . Why was this taking so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up indignantly and looked around : An empty plane . This was terrifying . He quickly got down . She was looking at him from a few inches away , red-faced in her tuck position . She had the most unusual little thumbs  --  shallow and wide , with tiny rectangular nails way up at the very top . The variety of human life was just endless . " I was going to a wedding , " she said in a normal voice . " Right before Christmas ? " " I know ! She has some nerve . " " I think I wet my pants ! " he realized . She handed him some Kleenex from her bag . " Hey , nice meeting you , " he said , and she laughed . He stared at the tiny little horizontal window of her thumbnail as if he could see his future there . He repeated her name over and over as they went down . None of that , now When things got very bad , and luggage went caroming through the cabin , Justine was too terrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking ahead constantly does n't mean you 're covered against every eventuality , and acts of God . However , it felt very familiar with Barry Cantor . She did n't even know his name until after she 'd kissed him . She had never kissed a man first . What did it say about her life that she was comfortable kissing a stranger in a crashing plane . There was deafening violence . If she made it through this alive , she would have to reassess her entire way of living . She was hit by things flying by in the massive crunch when the plane smashed across the ground . There was a scramble , people climbing over her to get out , pushing frantically at the door . On automatic , she slid down the yellow chute into freezing brown water , thigh-high . She was a live . She waded through the filthy , icy swamp to the edge of the tarmac . People in orange jumpsuits and ambulances were speeding around . They were hosing down black smoke in the center of the plane . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stepped up onto broken concrete in sopping panty hose . She was looking for Barry Cantor . But there were so many people , so much twisted garbage . The smell of burning plastic made her gag . A huge bus came to ferry them to the terminal . She must have turned her ankle in the crush to get out of the plane . There was pushing and raised voices in the bottleneck at the door . Inside , everyone was milling around dazed , wet and flushed , wearing silver thermal sheets around their shoulders , panting white steam in the cold , gagging . She did n't see him anywhere . Someone gave her a silver thermal sheet . Suddenly , she had never been this cold ; her clothes were swampy , her thighs were chafing . Her coat was on the plane . Her shoes were gone . The ankle was throbbing . " Passengers from WorldWide Flight 358 ! " a tough Brooklyn voice spat from the system . " Please proceed into the processing area . " The noise was painful . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . She almost cried . The tough voice continued to shout at a blistering volume : " If you or a member of your party is unable to walk , please stay where you are and bring it to the attention of a member of the ground crew . " Justine realized with shame that she had n't thought about her mother . She 'd thought about her father , briefly , just after she threw up . She had wondered what kind of impact , if any , her death would have on his life . But she had n't thought about her mother . There was chaos in the terminal . The noise was intolerable . Justine pulled herself along a carpeted wall . She wanted a shower , dry clothes , sweaters , quiet . She spotted Barry from behind  --  he was the tallest man in the next lounge . He looked like somebody 's husband . She hopped up behind him and put her hand on his arm . He squeezed her in an excruciating hug . Chaos continued all around . She closed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and she fell forward ; Barry helped her to a seat . He was exactly the sort of guy who never spoke to her . He smiled as if he wanted to cry . He really did look like somebody 's husband . But did he look like her husband . All at once , he began talking . " Can you believe this ? Nothing like this has ever happened to me ! I 've always wondered how I would handle it  --  did you ? " " Not really , " she said , smiling at his enthusiasm . " I thought you handled it great ! I was so impressed with you ! " he said , squeezing her waist with both hands . She cringed and crossed her legs , forgetting her ankle . The whole of her leg throbbed . " I knew it was the end when the stewardess got scared . " She wanted to lie down and be still . A woman sitting nearby began talking at them : " Did you see that elderly man going down the slide ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was trying to bend her glasses back into shape . " Oh , my Lord ! " Barry took the glasses from her and tried to fix them . " Did you go out the back or the front ? " " The back , " the woman said . " We went out the front . " He returned the glasses and asked a squat , lumpish man across from them , " Back or front ? " It was over . Justine wanted to go home and take a shower . She wanted to take a shower wi th Barry Cantor . Why was he talking to these fat old people he did n't know ? A whole new group had gathered ; they were exchanging stories , displaying their burns and bruises . " This man in front of us had a seizure , " a woman younger than Justine said to Barry . " Do you think he died ? " she asked , screwing up her face like a little lost lamb . " Barry , " Justine said . " I have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new friends . " Well , adios , it 's been surreal . " " I want to give you my card , " the glasses woman said . They waited while she dug around . " I do n't have it , " she wept , making a face Justine did n't want to look at . " I do n't have anything . " Barry put his arm around this woman 's shoulders . " You have what God gave you , " he said . " That 's all anybody ever has . " Oy , she thought . She did n't want to stand around for this . The fat guy said , " Cry , it 's all right , let it all out . " Justine was disgusted . She needed to pee . " Barry ? I have to go . I 'll be back . " There was a cutout symbol of a woman , and she followed the arrows , limping down the fluorescent boulevard . Violently bright lights suddenly turned on behind her . The Eyewitness News Team had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel was coming at her , fast . She would soon be up against a wall of these uniforms . She had to go . She limped , head down . A brisk blonde in a navy blue suit planted herself firmly in front of Justine . The rest of the fleet marched on . " Ma'am , you 're gon na have to stay in the designated area for safety reasons . We 'll have a doctor with you momentarily . " " Bathroom . " People were rushing by with medical equipment . The woman pointed with her whole arm towards the chaos . " Turn right at Gate 17A , there ' s a restroom down that concourse . " The door with the circle and the triangle was ten feet away . " That 's off limits , sorry . " The woman was squeezing her inner elbow and pulling her back towards the heat and anarchy . " It 's right there , " Justine shouted . " We have regulations during an emergency situation . " " You have regulations about that bathroom ? Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeing her arm . The woman stepped back . " I 'll sue your ass off . " She began to limp to the door . " You personally , not WorldWide . I 'm suing them separately . " Justine slammed into the empty bathroom , and sat directly on a toilet seat , in spite of a lifetime of training . She urinated with her shoulderbag resting on her thighs . Something terrible was going to happen . She sat with her arms braced over her knees , shaking . Several files were on the plane  --  days of research , lost . She hung over the sink , running her wrists under cool water as if she were drunk . The tough voice sputtered , " Passengers from Flight 358 ! Please be patient ! Everyone will be given complete and comprehensive medical attention free of charge ! " " Stop yelling at me ! " Her feet were raw and numb , like frozen meat . This was terrible . She limped out smack into the airline blonde who was now with a white-hatted nurse . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly . " Are you feeling all right ? " Justine burst into tears . " I , my ankle . " " Let 's have a look at it . Can you walk to those seats ? " " We are not responsible for accidents that occur in unauthorized areas , " the officious bitch hovered directly behind . " You 're making me nervous , " Justine snapped . " Go away . " The uniform left . Justine rolled her panty hose off , bar ely worrying that anyone would see . The nurse asked what her name was , where the flight had been going , what day was it , what year was it . " What is this , " she asked , suddenly petrified . " We always check for head injuries . Now blood pressure . " " Hey ! " Barry sat down next to her and she felt a strange rush of relief . " How 'd you get your own private nurse ? " When the nurse finished with her and turned to Barry , Justine paid close attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being fat . That happened sometimes with men . He squeezed her hand in time to the nurse 's pumping as she took his blood pressure . " What day is it ? " the nurse asked . " The first day of the rest of my life , " he offered freely . " Did anyone die ? " " No , " the nurse rose . " Okay , I 'm just triage , I do n't treat you . Both of you get on line three , and you stay off that foot . " A whole crew of navy blue Worldwide personnel set up shop in their lounge . She and Barry were given the numbers 67 and 68 on the third medical line . People clamored to be interviewed on television . She lay down over three seats and put her head in Barry 's lap . All she wanted was quiet . He continued to talk compulsively : the turbulence , the noise , the landing , the injuries , the engine . She wrapped her legs in the silver sheet . The night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third 18-hour day in a row when Chris Farlowe had called her in to ask her to work on a tender offer . She 'd declined . She never declined . Farlowe was tall , stout , unpolished , unrepentant , and often enraged . He had routinely asked her to be acting partner on choice assignments . He whipped off his glasses and said irascibly , " Trouble at home ? " " Excuse me ? " " Do you have a perso nal problem . Things of that nature . Do n't go into it , " he added quickly , a hand up in warning . " I do n't want to know . " " No , but I have a wedding this weekend , " she said , and his weedy gray eyebrows shot up . " Not my own , " she reassured him . " Thank God , " he said offhandedly , as if the idea were so preposterous it barely qualified as a bad joke . So of course she had to burst into tears on his desk . " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened before . Farlowe jumped up to slam his door . He had no tolerance for apathy , never mind hysterics . He waited  --  clapping his hands  --  for her to compose herself . But she could n't stop . This was beyond unprofessional . This was corporate suicide . He sat on the Management Committee , the Partnership Committee , and co-chaired the Corporate Department . Farlowe shook his big , lolling gray head . " Come on , Schiff , " he kept warning impatiently , drumming his fingers on the desk . " None of that , now . " Women were one thing at Packer Breebis Nishman Grabt . Married women were something else . A single woman trying to get married was the lowest form of life . From this moment on , no matter how many 18-hour days Justine billed , Farlowe and partners would treat her like a coed resting between shopping sprees at Saks . Barry Cantor would not stop talking . " It 's going to be at least three hours on this line , " a man with a bandaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Justine almost burst into tears again . She rose and limped to a patch of empty carpet and lay down with the silver sheet . People were rushing , screaming , crying . She 'd lost her shoes , her coat , her files . Barry squatted down by her side . " What 's up ? " he said very loud . " Tired . All of a sudden . " " That 's it ? No problems under your clothes I can check ? " His teeth overlapped in the front . He was very charming . It was a shame he was talking so loud . " Passengers from Flight 358 ! After you have seen Airline and Medical Representatives , you are free to depart the recovery area ! " A small cheer erupted ; Barry participated in it . " There will be vouchers for the 7 P.M. WorldWide flight to Phoenix ! " There was an eruption of derisive laughter . " And there is no smoking in the terminal , subject to fine and/or imprisonment ! " Justine sat up . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to Phoenix , she should go in and work on that tender offer . She rose . " I have to get out of here . " " Do n't you want your luggage ? " She wondered if Barry Cantor was the kind of guy she might have slept with in college , but did n't have much use for now . On the other hand , had n't she decided to rethink her life ? No : some things were core concerns . He was sitting there like all the other sheep , waiting for somebody else to make arrangements for him . This infuriated her . " I 'm going . " She held her hand out , disappointed . " Oh , I see , a polite handshake at ground level . " He pulled her into him and squeezed . He pressed his lips to her forehead . He was tall , he was solid . There would be no question who weighed more . She was near tears again . " Look . All I want is a shower , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some help with that ? " I thought you 'd never ask , she thought . " Yes , " she said . There was massive traffic on the Grand Central Parkway : everyone on both sides of the highway was watching the column of dirty gray smoke and the dousing of the plane . Justin e tried to slow her heart down with the biofeedback exercises she 'd learned at an ABA seminar in Duluth last year . She 'd obtained a fast-track release by cornering a uniform and saying , " I am an attorney with Packer Breebis Nishman Grabt . If you think I 'm waiting on line you 've got another thing coming . " After they 'd signed medical waivers and release forms , a WorldWide man escorted them to the head of the taxi line and gave them booklets about postcrash trauma , psychiatric referrals , socks , toiletry kits , and packets of smoked almonds . In the cab , Barry held her bad foot delicately . It was rapidly losing outside skin sensations , and the internal pressure was mounting . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver . She wanted to shoo him away . She wanted to kiss him again . As an experiment , she leaned her head on his chest . It was comfortable . She closed her eyes . The car yanked forward and back . " Hey ! " Barry shouted through the partition . " We 've brushed with death already once today . Do n't stop and start like that . " " Well said , " she said . They got comfortable again . " Wait a minute , " Barry shouted . " I do n't have my wallet ! " The cab stopped short ; horns honked . The driver glared at them in the rearview . " I have it ! I have it ! " Justine shouted , waving her wallet . Barry looked at her as if she 'd produced a live animal from her sleeve . They sat up and separated . She wondered if she 'd make it to the TriBoro without wanting to disinvite him . All well and good at 20,000 feet hurtling to the ground . Inching through Queens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to decide until they got to her building . She did n't owe him anything . She did n't want to talk . " Well , we had a bonding , near-death experience , and now we 're realizing that we 're strangers , " he said seriously . " That 's normal . I 'd say let 's bond further in the shower , but you 're not the type . " " How would you know ? " " You 're the type who hands a man a moist towelette in a crashing plane . Something tells me you want your own shower . " He smiled broadly : " Hey ! I have two showers . " " No , " she said . " Home . " He looked disappointed , but he did n't push it . A cemetery loomed up on the left side . " Mr. Khalil Abdul ! " he shouted to the driver . " We almost died ! And now we know what life is ! " The driver turned on the radio , loud . Awful noise saturated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing thought since getting into the cab . Normally , she 'd have been acutely aware of whether he 'd try to chat her up , shortchange her , take her out of her way , or drive like a maniac . Surprising herself again , she kissed Barry on the mouth . She could tell they would be compatible this way , but she did n't want to get into it now . She was too tired . He laughed , as if amazed . As they turned on 76th Street , she handed him money , told him to demand a receipt , and kissed his cheek , which was salty . " Dinner ? " he asked . " Yes . " He took her card , but he did n't look at it . " Tonight ? " " No . " " I 'll call you then , " he said , and looked at the card . " Wait ! No ! I want the home number . " She began to tell him how rarely she was at home , but he interrupted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver handed back a pen . Barry Cantor wrote the number on the card , and gave her such a sweet , impressed , lovely look that she almost got back into the cab . He pulled her in and kissed her nose . " Nice meeting you , " he called , loud and sarcastic . She s tepped carefully over ice in the WorldWide socks , limping bare-legged into her lobby . Everything felt completely different .
