Section : NATURE 'S INFINITE BOOK Our ability to feel comfortable in hot climates depends on where we spent the first few years of childhood <p> Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor fifty years ago illustrates dramatically , in the political sphere , how conditions during a brief but critical time span can launch irreversible developments . Two hours of bombing forged an American determination for war that several previous years of distant events had not produced . If our fleet had been placed on top alert as soon as our radar and the destroyer SS Ward had detected the oncoming attack , our battleships might have suffered much less damage . In that case they might have thwarted Japan 's invasion of the Philippines and Indonesia , and the Pacific war would have ended quickly . If , on the other hand , the Japanese attackers had destroyed our aircraft carriers , docks , and fuel tanks , along with our battleships , we would have been unable to defend New Guinea or Guadalcanal . Japan 's position might then have proved impregnable , despite our much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually insured that there would be a Pacific war , that it would be a long one , and that Japan would ultimately lose it . <p> Biologists , too , have come to appreciate that exposure to certain stimuli during a sensitive time span may create irreversible effects . Critical-period programming , as it is termed in biology , forms an intriguing middle ground between two better-known extremes : irreversible genetic programming of our bodies and repeated , reversible programming throughout life . This month 's fiftieth anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor provides a good occasion for consideration of critical-period programming , because Imperial Japan 's physiologists contributed decisive insights to that field of science during the course of Japan 's overseas expansion leading to Pearl Harbor . <p> The example that I 'll discuss involves a phenomenon familiar to all of us from experience : our individually varying tolerance of heat and cold . If you observe your friends on a cold winter day , you 'll notice that some are shivering , while others , similarly dressed , appear comfortable . Such differences between husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " over how hot to set the thermostat or whether to open the windows . In summer you can see how people differ in their tolerance of beat . Among a group of your friends , some will be wilting , while others are comfortable ; some will be drenched in sweat , while others are scarcely sweating at all . <p> These individual differences began to impress Japanese physiologists in the early twentieth century . Until Commodore Perry " opened " Japan in 1853 , the Japanese , a remarkably homogeneous people , were confined to the modest range of climate in their home islands . With Japan 's acquisition of tropical Taiwan ( 1 895 ) , the tropical Marianas and Caroline Islands ( 1914 ) , and cold Manchuria ( from 1905 onward ) , the Japanese became exposed to a much wider range of climates and peoples . Japanese civilian study of climatic physiology was pioneered by Yas Kuno , a great physiologist who did research at the Medical College of Manchuria from 1911 to 1935 and then worked in Japan itself . Japanese opportunities and motivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese went overseas to hot or cold battlegrounds , Japanese military research groups did extensive studies of soldiers , prisoners , and civilians . While this wartime burst of research collapsed cataclysmically within a few years , Japan 's academic tradition of climatic physiology resumed after the war . Some of the resultant knowledge helps us to understand racial differences in human physiology , but much of it proves applicable to all humans ; it just happens that the subjects being studied were predominantly Japanese . <p> Especially illuminating was the research of Kuno and his students and colleagues on how our ability to sweat adapts to hot climates . As background , recall that we humans , perhaps because of our sparse body hair , are much better endowed with sweat glands than are most other mammals . These glands serve several functions . Glands on our palms and soles keep those surfaces moist , thereby improving our grip and our sense of touch . Glands in our armpits broadcast odors as sexual signals after we reach puberty . Many mammals broadcast such odors from the area around the genitalia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the ground as a quadruped 's nose . One may speculate that when human upright posture raised our nose high above our genitals , secretion of advertising odors shifted to the armpits so as to be close to nose height . Japanese physiologists reported that the capacity for armpit sweating correlates racially with the profusion of armpit hair : ample in Russians , reduced in Japanese , and least in Chinese . <p> Apart from the glands in our palms , soles , and armpits , sweat glands distributed over the rest of our body serve to keep us cool by the same principle employed in refrigerators : evaporation of a liquid ( Freon in refrigerators , water in our sweat glands ) carries away heat . For example , evaporation of a pint of sweat lowers the body temperature of a 140-pound person by about 10 degrees F In the course of an eight-hour work shift , Japanese factory workers in the summer lost up to twenty-four pounds by sweating , while soldiers doing heavy work in the tropics sweated at a rate of up to one gallon per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the heat influx from the surrounding air plus the heat produced by their own hard-working bodies . <p> When I visited Finland many years ago , the human body 's capacity to cool itself by sweating was illustrated for me by a vivid demonstration that Finns loved to inflict on visitors . I was taken into a sauna , which is really nothing more than a heated , dry room with a bucket of water and a ladle on the floor . My friends raised the temperature to 260 degrees F ( nearly 50 degrees F above boiling ) . They professed to love those conditions  --  I found them bearable , though uncomfortable  --  but we all sweated profusely and thereby maintained body temperature and survived . To prove that the thermometer was n't lying , my friends cracked an egg on the floor . The egg quickly cooked , because it lacked sweat glands . When more people entered the sauna and it began to feel crowded , someone shouted , " Enemman loyly ! " ( more steam ) and threw a ladleful of water onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat from evaporating . As our temperatures rose , the less hardy souls ( including me ) staggered out of the room , leaving the toughest fanatics to enjoy the sauna by themselves . <p> If you leave a cold climate for a tropical vacation , you can satisfy yourself that your capacity to sweat adapts to the new conditions over the course of a few days or weeks . For a given test exposure to heat , people who have acclimatized themselves to the heat produce more sweat and begin to sweat sooner than those who have not had that time . As one example , experienced workers in hot mines produce about three times as much sweat per work shift as do beginning miners . The earlier onset of sweating is due to greater excitability of the brain 's nerve centers controlling sweating , while the higher sweat rate involves adaptation by our sweat glands themselves . Still another physiological adaptation to hot weather is vasodilatation , or dilated blood vessels , which increases blood flow through the skin and permits us to radiate more heat by that route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a warm to a cold climate . <p> In addition to these reversible responses , Japanese physiologists also noticed seemingly fixed differences between tropical natives and temperate-zone visitors to the tropics . You too can convince yourself of those differences by comparing yourself with the natives , even at the end of a long vacation that you 've spent in the tropics . In moderately hot weather natives remain dry , while we visitors sweat profusely , so that our skin and clothes are constantly drenched . During my fieldwork in hot Indonesia , I am always surprised when my Indonesian colleagues remain comfortable in their long trousers and shirts , while I 'm shirtless and in shorts but still dripping wet . A few years before Pearl Harbor , Japanese physiologists quantified this familiar experience by comparing responses of Philippine natives and Japanese settlers in the Philippines . Subjects from each group were tested with one leg immersed in a tub of hot water . When the water temperature was 114 degrees F , the sweat responses of Japanese and native Philippine subjects were similar . But when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 112 degrees F , Philippine subjects showed no sweat reflex , although the Japanese subjects sweated as profusely as before . <p> In effect , tropical natives are more tolerant of heat than are some temperate-zone visitors and require a stronger stimulus before they need to begin sweating . This may sound paradoxical , since I just explained that newly arrived visitors also require a stronger stimulus than do heat-acclimatized visitors . The resolution of this paradox probably involves other adaptations of tropical natives for reducing heat influx or tolerating heat loads and thereby not having to live drenched in sweat . <p> Measurement of sweat 's salt concentration revealed a further advantage of tropical natives . While all the cooling power of sweat arises from its water content , sweat also has to contain salt , because our sweat glands have no mechanism for secreting water itself . Instead , in the first stage of sweating , the glands secrete salt , which pulls water along by osmosis ; in the second stage , the glands resorb some of the secreted salt . Salt resorption is much more complete in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps because tropical natives produce more of the adrenal hormone aldosterone , which regulates salt resorption . That adaptation is a big plus for them because it minimizes the risk of collapsing from salt loss during profuse sweating . <p> While tropical natives are harder to provoke into sweating , they can sweat more profusely when conditions demand it . It turns out that this is simply because they have a greater number of functional sweat glands . To count the number of glands , cover a small area of your skin with colored oil , then provoke yourself into vigorous sweating ( for example , by drinking a big cup of hot tea ) . The mouth of the pore where each gland opens onto the skin 's surface can then be located under a microscope by the gleaming white sweat droplet pushed up under the oil . Mapping out your functional glands in this way , you 'll find yourself able to spot the same glands at the same location from day to day . Extrapolating from a small area of skin to the whole body surface , Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional sweat glands per person : 1.4 million for the Ainu people of cold Hokkaido Island ; 1.9 million for Russians ; 2.1 million for Japanese ; but 2.4 to 2.8 million for the peoples of tropical Thailand , Taiwan , and the Philippines . Hence , a major reason that tropical natives can remain comfortable under hot conditions is that they have more functional sweat glands and can cool down faster . <p> It 's tempting to assume that the differences in sweat gland numbers between Japanese and tropical peoples are genetic and arose through natural selection . One can easily imagine how , in the tropics , people born with the most sweat glands would be less prone to heat stroke , would feel less wiped-out much of the time , and so would have more energy to rear babies and pass on their genes . In accord with this view of genetic determination of sweat gland numbers , Japanese immigrants who have lived in the tropics as adults for decades still have fewer functional sweat glands than do tropical natives . <p> But a beautiful set of observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years between the world wars , there was much flow of emigrants and re-immigrants between the Japanese homeland and the Asian and Pacific tropics . Japanese settlers emigrated to the tropics at various ages , gave birth to children in the tropics , and some of those children returned to Japan at various ages . The physiologists found that the number of functional sweat glands in tropical-born Japanese rivaled the high numbers in tropical natives ! Conversely , Japan-born Japanese who emigrated to the tropics as children and remained there for decades retained the low sweat gland count of lifelong residents of Japan . Evidently , our number of functional sweat glands is not immutably fixed by our genes but is instead fixed by the climatic conditions that we experience very early in life . <p> The explanation for this remarkable result emerged from heroic studies carried out by the physiologists Korehiro Ogata and Aikoh Kawahata in the years just before Pearl Harbor . Ogata sat for an hour in a hot chamber at 113 degrees F until his sweat was flowing profusely onto the floor . He then used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a small area of his skin ( by counting the gleaming sweat droplets under the colored oil ) . Finally , he cut off that piece of his skin , fixed it for histological examination , and counted up the actual number of sweat glands . He found that the actual number of glands exceeded the number of functional ones producing sweat droplets . That is , many of his sweat glands never saw action , even though they were identical in appearance to the functional glands . <p> Other studies had shown that sweat glands begin to form in the human fetus at about the fourth or fifth month of gestation . At about seven months of gestation , the glands can already be stimulated into secreting by injecting a suitable drug . However , infants can not yet sweat in response to heat ( as opposed to drug injections ) on the day of their birth . Instead , it takes from two to eighteen days for most babies to start to develop a sweat reflex . Kawahata therefore exposed Japanese babies and adults of various ages to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 to 100 areas of skin distributed over the whole body , and added up each person 's total number of functional sweat glands . That number gradually increased up to the age of two or three years and then remained constant through adulthood . <p> Putting these and other studies together , we arrive at the following formulation . All of us are born with roughly the same actual number of sweat glands , none of which respond to heat at birth . That response depends on nerve reflexes , through which a center in the brain receives sensory information about heat and then uses that information to send out signals on motor nerves controlling the sweat glands . Those reflex arcs become functional through use resulting from experience of hot conditions-but only during the first few years of life . The hotter the conditions under which we grow up , the greater the number of our sweat glands that get programmed to function . By age two or three , the programming is as complete as it ever will be . If we grow up in a hot climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of our lives we 'll be able to stay comfortable in hot weather by sweating profusely . If we grow up in a cold climate , our body soon decides that that 's what it will be like until we die , and barely more than half our glands become programmed . <p> In the jargon of modern biology , sweat gland function is fixed irreversibly by critical-period programming  --  that is , by conditions prevailing at a certain critical age , usually early in life . Well-known examples of this phenomenon abound in the field of animal behavior . For example , the great ethologist Konrad Lorenz got goslings to follow him around as if he were their mother , because goslings are born with a mental program telling them to follow the large moving object that they see within a short critical period after they hatch . Normally that object is their mother , but goslings can become programmed to follow Konrad Lorenz or another large moving object if it appears first . <p> Critical-period programming has been identified for many other human traits besides sweat gland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . People born with a mechanical impediment to sight that can be corrected surgically can not learn to interpret the normal range of visual information if the correction is postponed until after a certain point in childhood . Again , people deprived of the opportunity to learn language in childhood  --  like the famous wolf boy of Aveyron  --  do not master language if exposed to it late . Those of us who do learn to speak generally acquire much better pronunciation in a language that we learn as young children than in a language that we first study as adults . Evidently , our neural pathways for handling visual or linguistic information become programmed early . A corresponding behavioral example is the molding of our sexual preference : as children we form unconscious search images , modeled on the people we then see around us , that will influence which potential sex partners are most attractive to us as adults . <p> Thus , our bodies respond to our environment or life style with several possible levels of flexibility . Most flexible are body features that we can change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which waxes and wanes with exercise . Least flexible are genetically fixed attributes , such as eye color , which we not only can not change ourselves but also pass on unchanged to our offspring . For such inherited traits , a rut from which we can never swerve is selected for us at the moment of conception . <p> Critical-period programming offers an intermediate level of flexibility . We end up in a rut , yet that rut is n't selected for us until after conception . Hence our rut can be matched to current conditions around us  --  unlike the case for an inherited trait , which is matched only to average conditions faced by our ancestors over many generations of natural selection . If we move later in life to a different environment , we ourselves ca n't change . But at least our children will be as well adapted  --  in pronunciation , sweating ability , and some other respects  --  as children whose ancestors have resided there for many generations . <p> By Jared Diamond <p> <p> Jared Diamond studies physiology and evolutionary biology at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p>
