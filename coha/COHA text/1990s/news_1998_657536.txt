<p> The South African town of Louis Trichardt sits just south of the main Zimbabwe border post located at the top of the N1 highway . It likes to boast it is " The Gateway to Africa . " In other words , " Africa " is " up there " in Zimbabwe and beyond - not " down here " in the South Africa that was white-ruled until Nelson Mandela became president in 1994 . Now South Africans often look north-eastward past Louis Trichardt and wonder whether their " newly Africanized " country will go the way of Robert Mugabe 's troubled Zimbabwe , which was white-ruled Rhodesia until he took over in 1980 . Four years into the Mandela era , the illusion that South Africa is not part of " Africa " persists among the country 's white minority . For them Zimbabwe 's sometimes good news - on economy , crime , and education , for example - is undermined by the too-familiar African tale of failed Marxist policies , corruption , dictatorial tendencies , and disregard for human rights . " South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions , in an interview in Harare . " Everyone knows that 's dead . " Yet many South Africans look askance at the string of desperation measures President Mugabe has taken in the past year , the latest being his military intervention in Congo 's war and his ill-conceived land reform - seeking to appropriate millions of acres from white owners without compensation . He wants to regain the considerable prestige he enjoyed nationally and regionally as Zimbabwe 's first president . " So you 've been up in Africa , " a Cape Town hostess said to a friend just back from Zimbabwe . " We 're expanding into Africa , " Johannesburg businessmen tell their shareholders of forays to the north . It used to be that Zimbabwe was n't part of " Africa " either . Until 1980 it was Rhodesia , a little heaven for colonials exiting post-independence Burma and India and Britons fed up with rationing and the damp . In Rhodesia 's beautiful tropical highlands they enjoyed a perfect climate , English manners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good jobs were set aside for whites . While the rest of the Western world was going mod , then hippie , then punk , young ladies in Salisbury still wore white gloves to tea . After a vicious war in which atrocities were committed on all sides , Mugabe 's Marxist government won the 1980 election and renamed the country Zimbabwe . Rhodesians suddenly found themselves in Africa . Not for long . They fled south in convoys down that N1 highway , past the monument in Louis Trichardt to Hendrik Verwoerd , the architect of apartheid . They found new havens in Durban , Pretoria , and Cape Town . Now that black majority rule has spread to South Africa , several hundred " Rhodies " are driving back up the N1 each year , seemingly for good . They 're even more of a minority now : In 1970 there were 250,000 whites to 5 million blacks ; now there are 70,000 whites to 12 million blacks . Zimbabwe 's immigration service reports that each month about 100 ex-Rhodies apply to return to the country , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of retired persons who are going back to stay with their children and because it 's not much fun struggling on their Zimbabwe pensions in South Africa , " said John Redfern of the Pretoria-based Rhodesia Association of South Africa . " In other cases it 's younger people returning to help elderly parents manage a farm or business . " Joy Maclean , the widow of a Rhodesian " native commissioner , " moved from southern Zimbabwe to South Africa in 1984 , " but it was never the same as Rhodesia . " In 1996 , after her husband died , she returned permanently to live near her daughter in the Zimbabwean city of Bulawayo . Like so most of urban Zimbabwe , Bulawayo is pretty , tidy , organized - and black . " I love it here , " says Mrs. Maclean , who lives in a garden flat near her daughter 's home . " Rhodesia has always been my home . I love the Rhodesian bush . It 's true that everything here is such a mess , a lot of muddle and confusion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one feels one can still contribute something . " As recently as last year , farmers Keith and Charlotte Kirkman thought Zimbabwe was still the land of opportunity for their children . " We had a family meeting and the two of our children who live and work outside the country decided they would return permanently , " said Mr. Kirkman . " Then six weeks later , this happened . " " This " was Mugabe 's announcement that he would expropriate , without compensation , 12.4 million of the 27 million acres of Zimbabwean farmland owned by whites . Mugabe 's government has had its successes . It doubled school enrollment between 1980 and 1994 and has boosted the literacy rate to 80 percent , according to the UN Development Program . And it has maintained an economy that , drought years excepted , has enjoyed positive growth and is more diversified than any other in the region save South Africa , according to the Economist Intelligence Unit . Mugabe 's chickens came home to roost last year when an independent newspaper revealed that healthy senior government officials were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . To placate enraged war vets , his natural constituency , Mugabe gave them grants of roughly US$ 10,000 plus monthly pensions of US$ 80 . Those " gratuities " cost US$ 90 million , necessitating whopping tax increases . Those taxes then set the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions on the warpath . Its national strikes demonstrated the newfound power of its leader , Mr. Tsvangirai , and encouraged spontaneous demonstrations against food price hikes in January . The police responded brutally both to strikes and riots . <p> MUGABE then backpedaled by imposing price controls and continuing with food and fuel subsidies the treasury can not afford . Meanwhile , the financial sector is already reeling from the failure of a bank owned by Mugabe 's crony , Roger Boka . As rumors abound that Mugabe used low-cost-housing funds to build a mansion for his new wife , his Cabinet is in revolt and the economic indicators indicate free fall . Between January and September the Zim dollar lost more then 55 percent against the US dollar . Inflation has soared to 30 per cent and interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of infrastructure , crime , and the health of its economy , Zimbabwe is still far better off than the rest of the continent outside South Africa . White South Africans remain highly sceptical of the " African renaissance " promoted by South African deputy president Thabo Mbeki . He believes the age of the African dictator is ending and responsible government and economic growth are taking root . South Africa has a lot more going for it than Zimbabwe had at independence , according to Zimbabwean labor leader Tsvangirai , who fits the emerging mold of the African renaissance leader . The creation of Zimbabwe , said Tsvangirai , " came through the barrel of a gun that believed in strong central government that does n't give a hoot for people . But South Africa has a strong constitution to protect its people from dictatorship and a powerful civil sector , particularly trade unions , so the accountability process is very strong there . " Finally , Tsvangirai said , " Mandela has set the tone , not just for South Africa but for the next generation of leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics there that you find here . "
