In the desiccated climate of New Mexico 's San Juan Basin , a land of red sandstone mesas peppered with pinon trees , water is so precious that Navajo tradition regards it as a living entity . Survival here has long depended on the health of underground pools and streams that feed wells and the occasional surface spring . That 's why Billy Martin is worried . The water supply to his tiny town of Crownpoint ( pop . 2,500 ) is threatened , he says , by money-grubbers who do n't understand water 's importance to Native American culture . It sounds like a familiar story ... until you realize that Martin , 69 , is n't upset with white businessmen . He 's talking about his Navajo brethren . <P> Challenging the stereotype of Indians as uncompromising conservationists , more than 200 individual Navajo landowners have quietly leased 1,440 acres to Hydro Resources Inc. , an Albuquerque company that plans to mine uranium ore from a local aquifer ( a layer of water-bearing rock ) . The company has promised a lucrative payoff : more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high as 25% on the sale of the uranium ore . For some Navajo landowners that could translate into more than $1 million a year  --  a nice paycheck anywhere , but especially in a region with double-digit unemployment and an average annual income of less than $10,000 . Hydro Resources president Richard Clement Jr . says his company will eventually employ about 150 local workers to develop the site , one of the two largest beds of untapped uranium in the U.S. <P> But the aquifer containing the ore also supplies water to an estimated 10,000 people in and around Crownpoint , a town in which dusty yards are decorated with stripped-down car frames and visiting neighbors honk their horn rather than ring the doorbell . Less than 10% of the local Navajo stand to benefit directly from the mining leases , and many of the rest , conditioned by a history of false promises from outsiders , are n't buying Hydro Resources ' assurances that their water will remain unpolluted by the mine . <P> The town 's primary well is situated only 2,000 ft. from the nearest proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to preserve the water 's purity , says Mitchell Capitan , the soft-spoken leader of a grass-roots organization opposed to the mine . " We ca n't afford to risk our children and our future , " says Capitan . Martin agrees , " It 's a disruption to Mother Earth , and it 's not the Indian way . " <P> Or is it ? Hydro Resources contends that its extraction process poses no threat to the groundwater . The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission concurs , and the company has been granted a license to mine . " If there 's a resource there , why should n't our people be able to enjoy the proceeds of it ? " argues Ruth Bridgeman , 79 , who leased her property to Hydro Resources several years ago . Leonard Arviso , a Navajo who acts as the company 's liaison to his tribe , talks not of land or money but of children who are forced to leave the community for lack of jobs . " We can respect Mother Earth , " he says , " without wasting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
