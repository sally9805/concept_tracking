GOOD COMPANY // George Seifert has had a better first five years in coaching than all but two other head men in NFL history  --  Guy Chamberlin , who took the Canton/Cleveland Bulldogs to three straight league titles from 1922 to ' 24 , and Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns . Here are the coaches who have had the best five-year starts . // // W // L // T // Pct. // 1 . Guy Chamberlin Bulldogs 1922-26 // 55 // 9 // 6 // .829 // 2 . Paul Brown Browns 1950-54 // 52 // 14 // 0 // .788 // 3 . George Seifert 49ers 1989-93 // 66 // 18 // 0 // .786 // 4 . George Halas Bears 1920-24 // 38 // 8 // 9 // .773 // 5 . Vince Lombardi Packers 1959-63 // 52 // 16 // 1 // .761 // GEORGE WHO ? // The memory remains vivid in George Seifert 's mind . It was the day he was fired  --  from Cornell . In the Ivy League , for crying out loud . The year was 1976 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red , and it had ended as miserably as the first . Seifert 's two Cornell teams were a combined 3-15 . They lost to Columbia twice , and by the end of year two , the alumni had just about abandoned the program . So athletic director Dick Schultz  --  yes , that Dick Schultz , the one leaving his job as executive director of the NCAA under fire next month  --  called Seifert into his office and fired him . He then said something that stunned Seifert . " Some day , " Schultz said , " you 'll thank me for this . " // As he slunk out of Ithaca , N.Y. , Seifert was thinking , I never want to be a head coach again . Just give me a nice assistant 's job , and I 'll grow old and happy . // If Seifert had gotten his wish , we never would have seen what a good coach he is . In January 1989 , when 49er coach Bill Walsh bequeathed his job to Seifert , his studious defensive coordinator , the Niners were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , in Walsh 's last five seasons San Francisco had rolled to a mark of 64-23-1 , and who could possibly surpass the record of a football genius ? In Seifert 's first five seasons at the 49er helm ( chart ) , the Niners are 66-18 , including an NFC West-leading 9-4 this year after last Saturday 's 27-24 loss to the Falcons . // " People take him for granted , " says Dallas offensive coordinator Norv Turner . " To keep the thing going with different personnel and to rebuild the defense , that 's a great job of coaching . " // Seifert has brought to San Francisco what Phil Bengtson could n't bring to Green Bay after Vince Lombardi left , what Jim Dooley could n't bring to Chicago after George Halas retired , and what Richie Petitbon has n't brought to Washington in the first year after the retirement of Joe Gibbs . Seifert inherited a state-of-the-art offense , and he let it click . At the same time he retooled a defense that now has only two starters remaining from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most promising in the league . It is led by the monstrous front four of Dana Stubblefield , Ted Washington , Dennis Brown and Artie Smith , whose average age is 24. // Seifert , who will be 54 in January , is wise enough not to overreact when a player 's agenda conflicts with his own  --  when , for example , Jerry Rice whines about not getting the ball enough . Seifert knows that unless a player becomes a major distraction , as defensive end Charles Haley did before he was traded to Dallas in August ' 92 , things will usually work themselves out . No , Seifert is not a players ' coach , a guy who wanders through the locker room at 8:30 in the morning to take the pulse of his team . He is a calculating man who prepares his players to win , who does n't stay with veterans past the point of their effectiveness , who is not afraid of playing kids and who lets his assistants coach . // The successful coaches of the ' 90s will not be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be willing to change on the fly , let players play and fit systems to players . This is where Seifert 's strength lies . // " What I try to do , " he says , " is create an environment in which it 's possible to succeed . Football is a constant education . I present ideas , not mandates , and try to take advantage of the good people we have . A coach has to constantly adjust . " // And how do you rebound , what do you tell your players , after a crushing loss such as the one San Francisco suffered on Saturday , when the 49ers blew a 17-point fourth-quarter lead ? Seifert knows that words do n't get it done . " You just get into the next game , " he says . " You do n't spend a lot of time philosophizing . You just get back into football . Period . " // TIM TERRIFIC In the six years since he won the Heisman Trophy at Notre Dame , receiver-returner Tim Brown has been underused by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NFL 's premier players . Brown has kept the Raiders in the playoff chase with two superb games . On Dec. 5 he humbled the Bills with a 10-catch , 183-yard show in a 25-24 win , and his 74-yard punt return for a touchdown broke open a one-point game with Seattle on Sunday , giving the Raiders a 27-23 victory that improved their record to 8-5 . " The more time we spend together , the more I realize how good he is , " quarterback Jeff Hostetler says . " We 'll get better together . " // AL BUNDY DOES COLOR ? // A new TV partner could be on the horizon for the NFL , starting in 1994 . After meeting last week with Rupert Murdoch and others from his Fox network , league officials are considering moving Fox into the Sunday slot occupied for the last 24 seasons by NBC . Fox has become a serious player in the negotiations the league is conducting with the networks . // One thing Fox could do for the NFL is attract young fans , which the league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Beverly Hills 90210 and The Simpsons , so it might offer a hipper brand of game telecast than cither CBS or NBC , and it would undoubtedly promote games during its prime-time schedule . NBC , which has threatened to abandon the NFL if rights fees are n't rolled way back , apparently is n't bluffing , and the combination of irreverent Fox and conservative CBS could make an interesting three-year package . // STATS OF THE WEEK // At Stanford he was Touchdown Tommy Vardell ; at Cleveland he has one touchdown in 27 career games . // Only 531 days until the Jacksonville Jaguars play their first game , and they have already sold 45,000 season tickets . // JUST ASK US // The smartest thing that Jacksonville owner Wayne Weaver could do  --  aside from pursuing San Diego general manager Bobby Beathard to be his football czar  --  is to insist when he meets with commissioner Paul Tagliabue in January that the NFL exercise its option under Article XXXI , Section 2 of the new collective bargaining agreement . That 's the provision that gives the league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every round of the 1995 , ' 96 and ' 97 drafts . Three quarters of the teams must vote yea for additional picks to be granted , and Tagliabue should persuade them to do so . Jacksonville and Charlotte have paid an enormous toll to enter the league  --  $140 million apiece in franchise fees  --  yet they will receive only a half-share of the TV revenues for their first three years , which will leave them each with an estimated $55 million less than the other teams will receive in that time period . The least the NFL should do for the Jaguars and the Panthers is give them a big assist toward becoming competitive . // Unknown players deserving first-time selection to the Pro Bowl : San Diego center Courtney Hall , Pittsburgh tackle John Jackson , Jet linebacker Mo Lewis and Green Bay strong safety LeRoy Butler . Lewis , who has had double-digit-tackle games in 10 of the Jets ' 13 outings , is probably the team 's defensive MVP . He speaks for this unsung group when he says , " Sometimes when I pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the headlines and I think , I 'm playing better than these guys . Why are n't they writing about me ? " Soon , Mo . Soon . // You 've got to hand it to Tagliabue for negotiating the network TV contract the league signed in ' 90 and for achieving labor peace . However , he has evidenced brain lock in his appointments to the league 's all-important competition committee , which formulates playing rules . Last week he named Cincinnati general manager Mike Brown , yet another business-side guy  --  the commissioner 's fourth such appointment  --  to what is supposed to be a nuts-and-bolts football body . The committee , now co-chaired by Miami coach Don Shula and Giant general manager George Young , also includes Seahawk coach Tom Flores and Chief coach Marty Schottenheimer , all veteran football men . A businessman or two would give the committee some balance . But four ? Come on . // DISPATCHES // Late in the Rams ' 23-20 upset of New Orleans , L.A. rookie running back Jerome Bettis took off his helmet near the Saints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wanted to show them , Hey , I 'm for real . Here I am . Get used to me , " he said . They know , they know . Bettis , a 244-pound brick house , carried 28 times for 212 yards  --  the fourth-highest total by a rookie in NFL history . By the end of the first quarter , Bettis already had 125 yards on the ground and the Ram line was operating without its two best players , tackle Jackie Slater and guard Tom Newberry , who were injured .... // First hints on realignment : The league would like to shift Phoenix to the NFC West while keeping the **37;265;TOOLONG axis in the NFC East . There could also be a southern division , probably in the AFC , made up of Carolina , Jacksonville , Tampa Bay , Miami and Atlanta . The other Dixie entry , the Saints , would most likely stay in the NFC West .... // One NFC scout says that four of the top five picks in next April 's draft will be nonseniors , if all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's top five : Tennessee quarterback Heath Shuler , San Diego State running back Marshall Faulk , Ohio State defensive lineman Dan Wilkinson , Notre Dame tackle Aaron Taylor and Michigan running back Tyrone Wheatley . Taylor is the only senior .... // The agent for former Phoenix quarterback Timm Rosenbach , who walked away from football last spring at age 26 , has had a dozen inquiries from teams trying to get Rosenbach back into the game . " I try to tell them it 's over for Timm , " says Gary Wichard . Rosenbach will earn a degree in psychology from Washington State in May , but he still has some growing up to do . The last thing he said to anyone in the Cardinal organization , after the ' 92 season , was " See you in the spring , " but he never showed up for spring drills . Rosenbach 's decision was obviously painful , but he has never picked up the phone to tell offensive coordinator Jerry Rhome , who was a good friend , why he quit . // GAME OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this ? This game against the Super Bowl champs might be the best chance for the playoff-hopeful Jets ( 8-5 ) to win in the last three weeks of the season . The game is in the cold and the swirling December wind of the Meadowlands , which the Jets are used to . And in the last two weeks they visit the Bills and the Oilers , two teams in the thick of the playoff fight . Says New York cornerback Eric Thomas , " It 's the perfect opportunity for us to show everyone we can slug it out with a big guy . And Dallas is a big guy . " // THE END ZONE Moosemania has hit Dallas . Every time fullback Daryl ( Moose ) Johnston touches the ball , Texas Stadium resonates with Moooooose calls . The fans are showering him with gifts , too . Gianna , an upscale boutique in Irving , is sending Johnston a stuffed toy moose  --  with a belt worth a reported $3,000 wrapped around its waist . // This article contains a table .
