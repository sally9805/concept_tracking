A scalpel is a beautiful thing . Dr. Stanley Mackie had never noticed this before , but as he stood with head bowed beneath the OR lamps , he suddenly found himself marveling at how the light reflected with diamondlike brilliance off the blade . It was a work of art , that razor sharp lunula of stainless steel . So beautiful , in fact , that he scarcely dared to pick it up for fear he would somehow tarnish its magic . In it 's surface he saw a rainbow of colors , light fractured to its purest elements . " Dr. Mackie ? Is something wrong ? " He looked up and saw the scrub nurse frowning at him over her surgical mask . He had never before noticed how green her eyes were . He seemed to be seeing , really seeing , so many things for the very first time . The creamy texture of the nurse 's skin . The vein coursing along her temple . The mole just above her eyebrow . Or was it a mole ? He stared . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of her eye .... " Stan ? " Dr. Rudman , the anesthesiologist , was speaking now , his voice slicing through Mackie 's dismay . " Are you all right ? " Mackie gave his head a shake . The insect vanished . It was a mole again , just a tiny fleck of black pigment on the nurse 's pale skin . He took a deep breath and picked up the scalpel from the instrument tray . He looked down at the woman lying on the table . The overhead light had already been focused on the patient 's lower abdomen . Blue surgical drapes were clamped in place , framing a rectangle of exposed skin . It was a nice flat belly with a bikini line connecting the twin flares of the hip bones  --  a surprising sight to behold in this season of snowstorms and winter white faces . What a shame he would have to cut into it . An appendectomy scar would certainly mar any future Caribbean tans . He placed the tip of the blade on the skin , centering his incision on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protrusion of the right hip bone . The approximate location of the appendix . With scalpel poised to cut , he suddenly paused . His hand was shaking . He did n't understand it . This had never happened before . Stanley Mackie had always possessed rock steady hands . Now it took enormous effort just to maintain his grip on the handle . He swallowed and lifted the blade from the skin . Easy . Take a few deep breaths . This will pass . " Stan ? " Mackie looked up and saw that Dr. Rudman was frowning . So were the two nurses . Mackie could read the questions in their eyes , the same questions that people had been whispering about him for weeks . Is old Dr Mackie competent ? At the age of seventy-four , should he still be allowed to operate ? He ignored their looks . He had already defended himself before the Quality Assurance Committee , had explained , to their satisfaction , the circumstances of his last patient 's death . Surgery , after all , was not a risk-free proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's easy to confuse one 's landmarks , to make the wrong slice . The committee , in their wisdom , had absolved him of blame . Nevertheless , doubts had seeped into the minds of the hospital staff . He could see it in the nurses ' expressions , in Dr. Rudman 's frown . All those eyes watching him . Suddenly he sensed other eyes as well . He caught a fleeting glimpse of dozens of eyeballs floating in the air , all of them staring at him . He blinked , and the terrible vision was gone . My glasses , he thought . I will have to get my glasses checked . A drop of sweat slid down his cheek . He tightened his grip on the scalpel handle . This was just a simple appendectomy , a procedure a lowly surgical intern could pull off . Surely he could manage this , even with shaking hands . He focused on the patient 's abdomen , on that flat belly with its golden tan . Jennifer Halsey , age thirty-six . A visitor from out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motel room suffering from right lower quadrant pain . With the pain growing worse , she had driven through a blinding snowstorm to the ER at Wicklin Hospital , and had been referred to the surgeon on call for the day : Mackie . She knew nothing about the rumors concerning his competence , nothing about the lies and whispers that were slowly destroying his practice . She was merely a woman in pain who needed her inflamed appendix removed . He pressed the blade to Jennifer 's skin . His hand had steadied . He could do it . Of course he could do it . He made the incision , a smooth , clean slice . The scrub nurse assisted , sponging up blood , handing him hemostats . He cut deeper , through the yellow subcutaneous fat , pausing every so often to cauterize a bleeder . No problem . Everything 's going to be fine . He would get in , remove the appendix , and get out again . Then he would go home for the afternoon . Maybe a little rest was all he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peritoneum , into the abdominal cavity . " Retract , " he said . The scrub nurse took hold of the stainless steel retractors and gently tugged open the wound . Mackie reached into the gap and felt the intestines , warm and slippery , squirm around his gloved hand . What a wondrous sensation , to be cradled in the heat of the human body . It was like being welcomed back into the womb . He exposed the appendix . One glance at the red and swollen tissue told him his diagnosis had been correct ; the appendix would have to come out . He reached for the scalpel . Only as he focused once again on the incision did he realize that something was not quite right . There was far too much intestine crowded into the abdomen , twice as much as , there should be . Far more than the woman needed . This would n't do . He tugged on a loop of small bowel , felt it glide , warm and slick , across his gloved hands . With the scalpel , he sliced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tray . There , he thought . That was much neater . The scrub nurse was staring at him , her eyes wide over the surgical mask . " What are you doing ? " she cried . " Too much intestine , " he answered calmly . " Ca n't have that . " He reached into the abdomen and grasped another loop of bowel . No need for all this excess tissue . It only obscured his view of things . " Dr. Mackie , no ! " He sliced . Blood pulsed out in a hot , arcing spray from the severed coil . The nurse grabbed his gloved hand . He shook it off , outraged that a mere nurse would dare interrupt the procedure . " Get me another scrub nurse , " he commanded . " I need suction . Have to clear away all this blood . " " Stop him ! Help me stop him  --  " With his free hand , Mackie reached for the suction catheter and plunged the tip into the abdomen . Blood gurgled up the tube and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulled him away from the table . It was Dr. Rudman . Mackie tried to shake him off , but Rudman would n't let go . " Put down the scalpel , Stan . " " She has to be cleaned out . There 's too much intestine . " " Put it down ! " Struggling free , Mackie swung around to confront Rudman . He 'd forgotten he was still holding the scalpel . The blade slashed across the other man 's neck . Rudman screamed and clapped his hand to his throat . Mackie backed away , staring at the blood seeping out between Rudman 's fingers . " Not my fault , " he said . " It 's not my fault ! " A nurse yelled into the intercom : " Send Security ! He 's going crazy in here ! We need Security STAT ! " Mackie stumbled backward , through slippery pools of blood . Rudman 's blood . Jennifer Halsey 's blood . A spreading lake of it . He turned and bolted from the room . They were chasing him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lost in a maze of corridors . Where was he ? Why did nothing seem familiar ? Then , straight ahead , he saw the window , and beyond it , the swirling snow . Snow . That cold , white lace would purify him , would cleanse this blood from his hands . Behind him , footsteps pounded closer . Someone shouted , " Halt ! " Mackie took three running steps and leaped toward the rectangle of light . Glass shattered into a million diamonds . Then the cold air whistled past him and everything was white . A beautiful , crystalline white . And he was falling .
