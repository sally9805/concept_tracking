<p> IT FLOATS ABOVE DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES , a mirage in the California sun . For Walt Disney , it offers remembrance with dignity ; for Frank Gehry , a hometown monument to an architect 's career . For the Los Angeles Philharmonic , it is an emblem of long-sought international eminence . For local politicians , it sings a siren song to far-flung Angelenos , drawing them inward to the troubled center of this exploding universe of a city . <p> It is the Walt Disney Concert Hall ; that is , it would be if someone built it . Primed by an extravagant gift from Disney 's widow nine years ago and originally expected to be well along in construction by now and to open next summer , Disney Hall is still a glorified hole in the ground , its assets-in-hand slowly bled away by mismanagement and delay , its original cost estimates nearly tripled . If the finances are not assured within one year , the hall will not be built at all . <p> Mr. Gehry 's distinctive design has become both Holy Grail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair . A dangerous drain on money and civic confidence , it nevertheless holds up the seductive promise of a magical , magnetic cultural palace attractive not only to residents of Orange County but to the entire world . This is a quest not for just any symphony hall but for a particular one . A generic shoebox of a concert space would long since have been built . <p> If Disney Hall ever sets down to earth , there is a place waiting for it . The County of Los Angeles , which owns the land , has done its part by digging the subterranean garage on which Mr. Gehry 's delicately designed structure is supposed to fit . This hole , capped like an oil well , sits across the street from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion , the orchestra 's current home , which it shares with opera , ballet and , in spring , the Oscar ceremonies . For the moment , the parking garage looks like a low-slung warehouse , elegantly white . It is open for business , but business is reportedly sparse . <p> Hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be 97 years old , has seen no return on her generosity . Of the family 's gifts , totaling $78 million ( now more than $100 million with accumulated interest ) , $41 million has already been spent on " soft costs " : architects ' fees , drawings and specifications , lawyers , consultants . An accepted rule of thumb estimates soft costs of a construction project at 25 percent to 30 percent of hard , or actual building , costs . Here they have at times approached twice that . <p> Ernest Fleischmann , the Philharmonic 's wily and intrepid managing director for 27 years , will retire from his job next year , and Disney Hall would have left behind even more for Los Angeles to remember him by . Mr. Fleischmann , a vigorous 71 , expresses absolute certainty that the hall will be built , but it will not be easy . <p> Downtown Los Angeles needs saving , and Disney Hall , according to county planners , is to be among its saviors . The city center 's cluster of tall buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is busy by day but , given corporate mergers and suburban flight , not busy enough . The several hotels in the neighborhood do not appear full . Concert , opera , dance and theater audiences at the Music Center have few if any restaurants , cafes or safe promenades to tempt them on their way to their parking spaces . Spago is not far away , by car . <p> " Los Angeles was laid out in crossing boulevards and streets , " said Mr. Gehry in his Santa Monica offices recently . " It was one of the first linear cities in existence , and Wilshire Boulevard stretched across it like connective tissue . But the city fathers thought every American city ought to have a downtown , so they turned their backs on Wilshire Boulevard and the linear city . " <p> Irrelevant or not , downtown Los Angeles is there , looming out of the haze . So if Disney Hall is built , will people come and fill it ? Despite local groanings , the network of Los Angeles freeways works remarkably well , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can a nighttime downtown Los Angeles , no matter how brilliantly accoutered , seduce any more of what is largely an early-to-bed and early-to-rise work culture ? <p> Optimists say yes , adding the hope that a less pressured Chandler Pavilion can become a center for the city 's flourishing Pacific Rim cultures : Korean and Vietnamese theaters , for example . Whether Asian communities will actually get in their cars at night and pay the $7 evening parking fees is more fodder for debate . <p> Originally estimated at up to $100 million , Disney Hall 's costs , according to the consulting firm brought in to clean up the current mess , will come to $264 million . ( The $81 million parking garage was financed separately by a county bond issue . ) The new completion date is 2001 . But there is a catch . The project is $150 million short , and county officials , mixing hope with exasperation , have set a deadline for the raising of a major gift : $50 million or more , as a tangible demonstration that this hall can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forthcoming by June 1997 , Disney Hall will be dumped . <p> How did it happen ? Mr. Gehry 's design is a wonder . The interior curves like a boat : the orchestra settled in the prow , listeners seated all around , the ceiling undulating downward like blooming spinakers . To the sides of this boat are rectangular structures , housing everything patrons and performers will need . Around the design exterior walls bend , twist and swirl . Mrs. Disney is a gardener , and at her request , greenery and flowers will be everywhere . Disney Hall has been described flatteringly as a rose about to open and disparagingly as a collection of hatboxes sagging in the rain . <p> G IVEN AN ORIGINAL MANagement team that supposedly possessed experience , enthusiasm and political connections , Disney Hall went very wrong . One hears many explanations , often in the form of vague accusation , and one believes parts of all of them . Mea culpa is a phrase rarely come across in the brief annals of Disney Hall . <p> Mr. Gehry 's firm , considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now , farmed out the architectural drawings to someone else . Mr. Gehry says the drawings " do n't work " and will have to be done again ( by Mr. Gehry 's expanded forces and at a cost of $10 million ) . Harry L. Hufford , chief executive officer of the new management team , says the drawings work but are " incomplete . " Dworsky Associates , who did the work , said , " The money was n't there to do what was designed . " Dworsky allies say privately that Gehry 's work was confusing . Everyone agrees the drawings took much longer than anyone anticipated . <p> The county added to the confusion by attaching a hotel to the plan . New-found visitors to downtown would patronize it ; visiting artists would travel from hotel room to dressing room in a single elevator ride . Designs were made to accommodate the hotel . ( Mr. Gehry was enthusiastic , more so than the Disney family , which feared a clouding of the issue . ) But when international hotel chains lost interest , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one currently involved with Disney Hall wants to name names , but the original team does not seem to have done a very good job . Reins were loose . New managers hint at a prior preoccupation with self-protection . " The biggest mistake I made was not getting out of this thing a few years back , " said Mr. Gehry , who is worried about Disney Hall 's influence on his reputation and his future business . " I saw what was happening . I wrote letters of warning , but nothing happened . " <p> Mr. Gehry points assertively to the branch of the Guggenheim Museum he is currently building in Bilbao , Spain . The design is similar to Disney Hall 's , and Mr. Gehry says that despite distance and language barriers , the $100 million project is on budget and on schedule . <p> Los Angeles still bursts with money old and new . A number of film executives or local patriarchs could write out the requisite check for Disney Hall without a tremor . After taking hits from bank mergers and a post-cold-war malaise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking up . Film and recording businesses here generate huge incomes from all over the world . The incidence of staggeringly expensive cars on Los Angeles freeways is staggering in itself . <p> But Disney Hall fund-raisers find themselves on a precarious ledge . For if Mrs. Disney 's generosity goes unrequited , who among Southern California 's philanthropists will be eager to give to the arts again ? Asked whether Disney Hall is going beyond the Los Angeles community to get its money , Mr. Fleischmann will say only that the question is very delicate . Mayor Richard J. Riordan is an enthusiastic champion . <p> Disney Hall remains a tough sell , even though it is generally understood that a big gift will put the giver 's name up in limestone . ( The Disney name is , of course , not negotiable , but one possibility might be " The Walt Disney Concert Hall at the blank Symphony Center . " ) <p> General trends in giving run nowadays toward medical and social problems . In old Los Angeles , as in other American cities , culture was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symphony or opera were handled by a few personal checks . But the white , Anglo-Saxon and heavily moneyed class is dispersing in southern California , and the film community , heavily Jewish , was never readily invited into this cultural world . Today Disney Hall could use some of that Hollywood money , but Hollywood , a more or less self-contained community , seems uninterested in venturing where it was once made to feel unwelcome . <p> M R. FLEISCHMANN points out the city 's lack of corporate headquarters , the favorite fishing grounds for arts organizations in Chicago , Pittsburgh or Detroit . As they immigrate farther into suburban southern California , people with money are making new artistic allegiances with performing-arts centers closer to home : the Thousand Oaks and the Cerritos Centers , the huge Orange County Performing Arts Center . <p> " Los Angeles is an entrepreneurial city , " said Emily Laskin , who handles development for the Los Angeles Philharmonic . " People come here to develop a project , and then they leave . There are fewer fixed institutions , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape institutions . I worked in Minneapolis , and even those with modest incomes donated to the arts . They did it out of civic responsibility . " <p> Disney Hall was in a hurry from the start , and that has been part of the problem . Though all parties agree that the Disney family has been unflaggingly supportive and patient , inescapable was the understanding that a generous patron , well along in years , wanted ( and deserved ) to see something in return . Disney Hall began on a fast-track basis ; that is , plans went ahead without all the final details worked out . Mr. Gehry says fast-tracking is common practice , but Mr. Fleischmann , among others , regrets the lack of a specific budget . <p> Mr. Gehry says his original designs were scrupulously cost-effective , and subsequent studies indicate that the Disney project compares favorably to another troubled but now completed concert hall , the Meyerson , in Dallas . <p> There were other false starts : a downward revision with Mr. Gehry 's proposed chamber-music hall excised ; the replacement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was the hotel idea , and legal fees have kept piling up . Each year Disney Hall is delayed means an additional $9 million . <p> The big trouble arrived two years ago , when construction bids came in . They were unexpectedly high , said Mr. Fleischmann . Feasibility studies were ordered from outside consultants ( Hines Interests ) ; professional fund-raisers ( Milano , Ruff and Associates ) were hired , and a new board was assembled to pull Disney Hall together . Mr. Gehry points out wryly that he is the only surviving member of the original team . <p> Does the Los Angeles Philharmonic really need a new orchestra hall ? It would help . The Chandler is multipurpose , acoustically mushy , sedate and a little gloomy . Not much used in summer these days , it presents hectic competitions for space between orchestra , opera and other functions during high season . <p> " Large amounts of money are paid stagehands to take down and put up opera sets in a matter of hours so that the stage can be cleared for other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the new hall saves money . " More high-priced donor boxes have been allowed for , meaning added income for the orchestra . <p> The prospect of Disney Hall , furthermore , is a lure and an anchor for the orchestra 's young , energetic music director , Esa-Pekka Salonen . Whether its failure would prompt Mr. Salonen to move on is unknown . He has , however , signed on until 2001 , when the new hall is now scheduled to be completed . <p> Lev Yaroslavsky , a county supervisor , ticks off the usual reasons for building Disney Hall : the new restaurants , shops , hotels and cafes ; the new jobs they will generate ; in general , the reseeding of downtown Los Angeles for future growth . But Mr. Yaroslavsky , blunt and burly politician that he is , dreams the dream everyone else connected with this project continues to dream . <p> " One hundred years from now , if Disney Hall is still standing and even if the demographics here have changed , it will survive as a landmark , as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Gehry design is something unique , something very California . Is it necessary ? William Mulholland , who designed the water system for Los Angeles , once said , ' If you do n't bring the water , they wo n't need it . ' Here it 's the same . If they build this hall , it will become a destination point , a reason people go somewhere , like the Sydney opera house in Australia . " <p> A ND WHAT IF THE BIG GIFT is not forthcoming by next June ? Will the county grant more time ? " I 'm not in a position to say if an extension will be possible , " Mr. Yaroslavsky said , " but if there is to be a major gift , we ought to know it in a year . " <p> Meanwhile , do n't underestimate the power of a monument . And Disney Hall promises a multipurpose monument to much and many : to Walt Disney , who posthumously will have paid for much of it ; to Frank Gehry , who designed it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of Los Angeles , grasping for firm ground in this seductive , restless urban space . <p> " Maybe this hall is already obsolete , " Mr. Gehry said in a moment of apparent whimsy . " Maybe I should start all over . "
