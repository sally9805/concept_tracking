Cesar Pelli lives and practices architecture in New Haven , Conn. , for him the perfect distance from Manhattan : close enough to visit for an afternoon , far enough to experience the New Yorkophile 's delight each time he plunges into the city . " Coming down Broadway , " Pelli recalls of a recent visit , " I suddenly noticed this burst of golden light up ahead . " He smiles his sheepish , civilized grin . " It was this building of mine . " Pelli , 64 , has designed some of the worthiest large buildings of the past few years : the humpback blue glass Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood ; Wall Street 's vast , handsome World Financial Center ; the romantic 1930ish Norwest Center in Minneapolis  --  each one urbane and appealing and unlike the others . But this new building , this burst of golden light in midtown Manhattan , is Pelli 's best work yet . Indeed , Carnegie Hall Tower , officially finished last week , is the finest high-rise to go up in New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more salutary given the building 's horribly overbuilt location : just 25 ft. east stands Metropolitan Tower , a grim , 66-story black glass trapezoid finished in 1986 ( only the two-story Russian Tea Room separates the two buildings ) , and less than a block south is architect Helmut Jahn 's new 70-story Cityspire . Yet instead of adding to the high-rise pile-on , Carnegie Hall Tower improves the neighborhood and the skyline  --  in part by visually eclipsing Metropolitan Tower  --  and proves that grandeur need not equal bulk . Pelli 's apartment-and-office tower is a full block deep and 60 stories tall , but it is marvelously narrow  --  a mere 50 ft. wide . New buildings of this height usually contain two or three times as much square footage ; no matter how interesting or tarted up , such behemoths almost inevitably darken and oppress their bit of the city . This slender , elegant slab is like a dancer among thugs . <P> The unusual difficulties Pelli faced  --  squeezed site , Carnegie Hall as partner and next-door neighbor  --  are what have made the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the architect says , " are not necessarily negative . They force you to try avenues you would have ignored . " Contextualism has been the urban-design buzz word of the past decade , but no architect has done a better job of fitting a big building into such an important , tightly woven urban fabric . The 535,000-sq. - ft. tower is technically an addition to Carnegie Hall and takes important aesthetic cues from it . <P> The hall 's century-old Roman brick and terra cotta are suggested on the tower by a skin of brownish and amber brick in five shades , and the molding and cornice lines of Carnegie 's beaux arts facade are continued across the front of Pelli 's building . The high-rise is wrapped by thick metal bands at six-floor intervals corresponding to the older building 's height . <P> Pelli , however , did not make the standard postmodern mistake of replicating an old form at inappropriately huge size . The interior spaces are modest ( no more than about 14,000 sq . ft. per floor ) , and an intricately detailed exterior suggests a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four metal grids , each bolted at an upswept angle to the 60th floor , provide a classically inspired , yet unequivocally modern top . " We picked up threads of the past , " says Pelli , " with a contemporary technology and contemporary sensibility . "
