<p> Overnight , Viagra , the new drug developed by Pfizer Inc. to combat male impotence , has become the topic of evening news programs , late-show comedy monologues , cocktail party conversations , online chat rooms and pillow talk in bedrooms everywhere . Once some of the curiosity  --  and the demand  --  is satisfied , though , the drug could produce changes far more wide-ranging than originally intended . <p> " What you 're really seeing is unbelievable interest in this drug , and it 's telling us something about our culture , " says internist Steven Lamm , who teaches at the New York University School of Medicine . " A lot of men are unhappy with their sexual performance . " <p> Not Alfred Pariser , 58 , of Rancho Mirage , Calif . A survivor of severe prostate cancer , Pariser says he tried a passel of other potency-promising methods before signing up for the last available space as a subject in the Viagra test . " It really , really works , " he says . <p> His wife says the drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned him into Tarzan . Pariser says he now has sex " as often as I can . . . sometimes two or three times an evening . " <p> If Viagra is n't the prize , the next potency pill to come from a drug company lab will be . Or the next . Viagra has demonstrated that there is a Mighty-Joe market for orally administered manliness . Telephones in urologists ' offices are beeping almost nonstop . <p> " This is just the beginning , " says Lamm , author of " The Virility Solution , " a study of potency to be published next month . " This is blunt treatment . " <p> Blunt but not dull . If nothing else , Viagra is raising a multitude of questions : What will it do for men who are not impotent ? What does it mean to be impotent ? Or potent ? If the drug measures up to its hype , will bedroom politics ever be the same again ? <p> Publicly the company is playing down the idea of potent men using Viagra as an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on potent males , " says Pfizer spokesman Andy McCormick . " We do n't think it 's a performance enhancer . " <p> " We 're going to be moving away from what we consider normal to what is considered ideal , " Lamm says . <p> For now , many men are struggling with less-than-ideal circumstances . An estimated 30 million American men , mostly over the age of 50 , suffer from impotence , according to Pfizer . The inability to engage in sexual intercourse can wreak havoc on relationships and shatter self-esteem . Before Viagra the various methods for treatment were cumbersome and/or painful . This , however , is an easy pill to swallow . Taken orally about an hour before sexual activity , the drug  --  originally tested as a heart medication  --  increases blood flow to the penis . If a man is aroused , he is able to get and maintain an erection . According to Pfizer 's tests , 70 percent of the more than 4,000 impotent men tested worldwide had positive results . Potential side effects include headaches , indigestion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inability to distinguish between green and blue . <p> Doug Hammonds , 44 , an aircraft mechanic in Mesquite , Tex. , says he could not figure out the cause of his problem . His urologist prescribed Viagra when the drug first became widely available a couple of weeks ago . " I swear by the stuff , " he says . <p> Before having sex with his wife , Hammonds pops a 100 milligram pill into his mouth . And everything works fine . He has experienced some headaches . " I just take a couple of Tylenol and they go away , " he says . <p> Viagra has also reinvigorated Charles Cate , 59 , a retired Wal-Mart employee in Rogers , Ark. , who has undergone a heart bypass and radical prostate surgery and is a " borderline diabetic . " <p> " I 'm single , but active , " he says . He 's been dating the same woman for more than a year . Viagra , he says , works like a charm . He uses it every night . <p> His success has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , has made him feel like a whole man again . " You feel like you can compete with anybody . . . like you 're middle-aged again , 30 or 40 years old . " <p> He says , " You can go out and be more active . Psychologically it really clears your mind . " His girlfriend , he says , " rates it a 10 . " <p> Will such stories alter the definition of potency ? And increase the level of performance anxiety ? <p> Shauna Farr-Jones , a biotech researcher in San Francisco , is married to a doctor who has prescribed Viagra in his primary-care medical practice . She is also a member of a women 's investment club that monitors biotech stocks such as Pfizer . The group has not only discussed the drug 's financial potential but its social aspects as well . " We 've talked about how it will be really good for older men and people with diabetes , " she says . " Their wives will be happy . " <p> And what about the healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " If it does n't have bad side effects , " says Farr-Jones , " I do n't see a problem with that . I bet Pfizer would be thrilled . " <p> Like a national truth serum , the little blue pill also has begun to open up discourse among men and women about triumphs and failures between the sheets . Formerly obscure phrases such as " erectile dysfunction " and " urethral suppositories " are showing up in popular parlance . <p> It was n't so very long ago that our society choked on words like " masturbation " and " orgasm . " The birth control pill changed that . Not only did it prevent pregnancy , it wiped out some euphemisms . Check out a Cosmopolitan magazine at the local supermarket . <p> And " the pill , " as it was called ( befitting its first-in-line status ) , made it acceptable to talk about  --  or , by some lights , engage in  --  casual sex . Serotonin reuptake inhibitors , such as Prozac , made it all right to discuss depression without shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Viagra , or its offspring yet to be born , could make sexual dysfunction just another treatable malady . <p> When taboos are cracked open , the world changes  --  not only for the taboo busters but for the rest of us as well . <p> The arrival of Viagra could rival the impact of the birth control pill , which hit the market about 40 years ago . With the same generation as beneficiaries . <p> There is a difference : The birth control pill transformed the baby boomers at the beginning of their sexual lives . Viagra comes at the latter stages . But the upshot could be equally powerful . The birth control pill eliminated one undesirable outcome of extramarital and premarital sex  --  pregnancy . ( Leaving disease and eternal damnation still to be reckoned with , of course . ) The definition of a " good girl " became more fluid . Unmarried women were able to engage in sexual intercourse more freely . <p> The promise of Viagra , on the other hand , is the obliteration of the physiological and psychological obstacles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct that people in their fifties and sixties are physically in decline , less interested in sex , less capable of performing , more preoccupied with jobs and careers than with sexual pleasure , this could redefine an entire stage of life . <p> William Haseltine , founder of Human Genome Sciences Inc. , a private research company in Rockville that is seeking genetic cures to human ailments , does not believe Viagra will become the next birth control pill . He predicts that its influence will be more subtle . Part of the population will be more sexually fulfilled , and a smaller segment may use it for kicks . But by and large , he says , the changes will be private and personal , not public and widespread . <p> Will some men develop a dependency on Viagra ? Will some women develop a dependency on men on Viagra ? <p> It would be a shame if the use of Viagra means that the body or the mind becomes dependent on it , says George Leonard , a pioneer of the human potential movement and author of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erotic Love After the Sexual Revolution . " <p> Leonard abhors " quick fixes " in society . " I feel strongly that big changes in someone have to do with lifestyle , " says Leonard . He believes that people with impotence problems need a total make-over  --  of their behavior , their diets , their exercise regimens , the way they look at life and at other people . " The mind is such a powerful part of pharmacology , " he says . <p> " I do n't think that Viagra in any way denigrates love , affection , romance , " he says . But when he brought up the subject with a couple of female friends , the women were taken aback . <p> " They want love to be involved , " he says . " I tried to assure them that in order for the drug to work , you have to really care , you have to see a little love light shine first . " <p> Eileen Palace , director of the Sexual Health Clinic at Tulane University , has done research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " People today expect things to happen on demand , " she says . " You ca n't make sex happen on demand ; it 's not a fax . Penises are actually very good barometers . They are indicators of what is happening in a relationship . " <p> The pill should not be used without therapy , she cautions . " It 's much more likely to be effective when you combine the psychological and medical treatments . " <p> " If you do n't have a sex drive , this pill wo n't give it to you , " says Arthur Caplan , director of the bioethics center at the University of Pennsylvania and a Pfizer consultant . " This is not a drug that 's going to make you interested in sex if you 're not . " But Caplan admits that as a confidence builder , Viagra is a potent thing . <p> He sees the potential for misuse . " I can imagine college kids saying , ' Hey let 's have a Viagra party . ' " <p> Though Pfizer is quick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some people could become psychologically dependent on the drug , and it may not be unusual in the near future " for a man in his fifties or sixties to carry a pill like he did a condom when he was younger . " <p> Is such a cavalier attitude good or bad for the male of the species ? Caplan says , " It 's not bad to take Viagra . But it is bad if you think the only way to have sex is by taking a pill . <p> " The best protection we 've got , " he continues , " is for the doctors who prescribe it to fully understand it . But in the end we 'll probably see more people using the drug than need the drug . " <p> Because many people will believe it is an aphrodisiac and that it will inspire confidence , says Caplan , " some people will use bigger doses than they should . " Pfizer recommends only one pill per day . <p> " The typical American attitude is that more is good , " Caplan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see some people abuse the drug . We can anticipate a black market . This stuff is n't that difficult to make . " <p> Barring some unforeseen glitch , Viagra will be at the center of our national sexual debate for some time to come . It 's possible that men  --  and women  --  of all ages will experiment with the pill in various ways . <p> But unlike almost any other treatment , men and women will need each other for the cure . Or , in the case of gay men , a partner of the same sex . Of all the health issues facing men , impotence is the only one that also directly affects another person 's body and sexual gratification . <p> The support of women is critical to the success of Viagra , and Pfizer discussed early on that it would probably do its first mass advertising in women 's magazines . " It 's a couple 's condition , " says Pfizer 's McCormick . " The partner is often involved in making the choice . In fact , with men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consult their partners . Women in general tend to be more involved in health decisions . " <p> From one angle , Viagra is just one more aspect of boomers refusing to grow old . It 's the Ponce de Leon drug . <p> " With baby boomers aging , " says Caplan , " there will be a big market for this drug . " He predicts that Viagra will " sweep past " existing treatments such as injections , suppositories and vacuum pumps . There may be an even bigger market : Pfizer has just begun tests to determine the effect of Viagra on women . <p> If medicine can help people keep hair , tone muscles , prevent breasts from sagging , why not a drug that enables erections ? Why should n't doctors be prescribing it to just about anyone who asks for it ? <p> Practitioners like Steven Lamm are wrestling with questions like that . " Impotency is not a life-threatening disease , " he says . " What is my mission ? Am I a repairman ? A coach ? Or a doctor ? @
