<p> Here 's a radical idea : Instead of government bureaucrats prescribing fixes for urban poverty , as they 've done for decades without much success , why not pay residents of the hardest-hit neighborhoods to come up with their own remedies ? <p> Oakland is in the midst of just such an experiment . Thus far , the results have been revealing  --  painfully so . <p> The experiment , and similar ones in San Francisco , Los Angeles and dozens of other cities nationwide , are part of a much-touted urban uplift program dreamed up by the Clinton White House . The goal is to snap the cycle of poverty gripping the cities ' poorest neighborhoods . <p> Oakland 's approach was to create teams of citizen ground troops who get stipends and fringe benefits to test various ways of transforming a slippery buzzword  --  " empowerment "  --  into concrete reality . Their efforts range from staging rallies to whip up neighborhood enthusiasm to hiring youths to sweep streets and helping welfare recipients prepare for job interviews . <p> It 's a romantic , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most bereft citizens can achieve leadership on a government program 's slim checkbook and tight deadline . But as money was spent , with little to show for it , the romance quickly soured . <p> Njelela KwaMilele was so disappointed with the program 's first year she 's banned the term empowerment from her vocabulary . <p> " It 's the cliche for now , the proper thing to say if you 're into community activism , " said KwaMilele , a West Oakland activist who serves as co-chair of the Oakland program 's policy board , " Does it really work ? I say no , because it 's not truly empowerment . Empowerment is , you take the reins . " <p> Those involved differ on who 's responsible , but they agree on what went wrong . From the start , there was no clear understanding across the gulf between official power and battered , suspicious communities on what it meant for citizens to take leadership , on how to measure success and on how to resolve differences . <p> Some citizens felt that the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later the Oakland Enhanced Enterprise Community  --  was to challenge official authority . But even those content to merely share power soon felt that City Hall would n't let them  --  or could n't figure out how . <p> Officials , for their part , say they were reluctant to butt in . They feared that to do so would be to violate the spirit of the experiment and perpetuate the cycle of cynicism the initiative was intended to break . They had faith that the ground troops and their nonprofit consultant handlers could find their way toward success and would be thankful for the freedom . <p> " We thought , if we just let them do that , they wo n't feel that way about us , but they did feel that way about us , and there were n't the controls there should have been , " said Elissa Brown , who runs the effort for the city manager 's office . <p> Thus , the project rambled and sputtered , causing its caretakers pain and tears as the first installment of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were scattered about . <p> To some degree , there is nothing to Oakland 's troubles that cities have n't experienced time and again in the long history of presidential urban anti-poverty initiatives . <p> " In terms of getting people involved and working together , it 's extremely difficult because of everybody 's agenda , " said Rebecca Chapman , a Bethesda , Md. , job training consultant . " Also , people do n't trust initiatives that help them help themselves , because when the funding is over , they 're no better off than they were in the beginning . " <p> The Clinton approach is a blend of conservative and liberal ideas tailored to the era of smaller-is-better government . It offers investment incentives and hails volunteerism , served up in a thin wrapper of social spending . <p> " Clinton , who really does n't have a major urban planning program , ca n't abandon Democratic ideals , " said Eugene Grigsby , a UCLA public policy expert . " Empowerment zones became a politically acceptable urban agenda . " <p> The zones are neighborhoods in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures as unemployment and household incomes . In addition to economic incentives for businesses to hire and invest , the federal government provides money for social services . Some cities , in turn , give some of the aid to selected residents to use for their betterment  --  and to lead and inspire others . <p> Although Oakland did not make the cut of United States cities awarded full empowerment zone status  --  and the $ 100 million in federal aid that goes along with it  --  it was picked for a sibling program identical in principle but much smaller in size . <p> As an " enhanced enterprise community , " Oakland was promised $ 44 million in loans and grants for economic development projects and $ 3 million for social services . <p> Many citizen leaders performed admirably in the program 's first year , distributing smoke detectors to residents living behind illegal window bars , helping people fill out school and job applications , gathering Southeast Asian and black residents to socialize for the first time , reaching out to women with information about breast cancer prevention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in private industry , " said David Shirley , who headed up a group in West Oakland . <p> " I do n't consider that a resounding success . . . Many people failed , " Shirley said . " Failure was due to lack of understanding of basic English , basic math . There 's a whole lot when you say you 're going to take people off ( welfare ) . . . We considered the nine a Herculean effort . " <p> Other citizen delegates , with $ 45-an-hour contract advisers providing direct supervision and with the city looking on from farther back , pursued projects that city overseers deemed after the fact to have been of questionable long- term benefit . They were particularly upset about scarce funds being spent on a rally for a proposed West Oakland economic development project called Mandela Village , saying organizers were interested less in cooperation than in old-fashioned , confrontational politics . <p> " ( We ) thought we were reinventing government , " said Jean Johnson-Fields , one of the coordinators of the program for the city . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't prepared for that responsibility . " <p> Officials acknowledge that community leaders received inadequate training and were poorly supervised . Although some of the 42 citizen leaders used the experience as a stepping stone to meaningful work , city overseers have no idea just how many . <p> Some citizens appeared confused about whether they were paid employees or volunteers receiving a stipend . In one fiasco , participants who were also receiving welfare found themselves in trouble with authorities after augmenting their pay by converting fringe benefits to cash . <p> After major repairs , the enhanced enterprise community will be rolled out for a second year this fall  --  although belatedly , and , because of front-office expenses during the repair job , with a third less money going out to the street than had been available the first year . <p> " For the community to be empowered and for the city to have strict oversight over the program , you have to have a lot more skill and experience than we had the first year , " conceded program chief Brown . <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience , " she said . " But what I can also say is , the community is less empowerment-oriented. "
