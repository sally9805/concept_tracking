<p> Western Europe 's will to consolidate is faltering as Community members reach a moment of decision . Something happened during the summer to drain off momentum from the intense new drive to change and strengthen the Common Market 's Treaty of Rome into the start of a real constitutional union . <p> In mid-December , member states will begin two conferences in Rome , one on setting up a single currency and one on political integration . But the goals are already being diluted and delayed . It 's as though Britain 's Margaret Thatcher had turned the tables and persuaded her partners that their national sovereignty mattered more than their search for the power of unity . <p> This should worry the U.S. With the collapse of Soviet political power , it would mean that America will be left the only big kid on the global block , with nobody its own size to share responsibility and tame impulse . It is n't a healthy prospect for many reasons , including the temptation for the rest of the world to identify America as the main target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . The Persian Gulf crisis set off by Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait was the most dramatic . There has also been the emergence of a single German state , the switch from euphoria to serious concern for the future of newly liberated Eastern Europe , and recognition that the Soviet colossus is disintegrating . <p> At first , the lack of an effective European capacity to make common decisions to deal with these startling developments spurred the sense of need to move rapidly . People began talking about writing a constitution , although they are still very fuzzy about whether it should be for a gigantic nation , a federation , a confederation or just better coordination . <p> But determination of leaders has ebbed as they near the point where stirring words must be converted into deeds . They recognize they face something new , without precedent in their history , just as the Eastern states have no precedent for replacing Communism with liberal democracies . Germany 's Helmut Kohl is somewhat encouraging again , but most of the others are shying away . <p> Italy 's ebullient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We should n't be talking about a European constitution ; that 's too fancy . It 's an ongoing process . It might take decades to reach our objectives . " The purpose , he says , must be to " prepare a pan-European entity . It needs the core of The 12 members of the existing Community , but we ca n't be selfish , we 12 . " <p> His Prime Minister , Giulio Andreotti , talks vigorously but ambiguously on both sides , as many government heads are doing now . <p> They were addressing a meeting organized by the Bertelsmann Foundation , a private German-sponsored group dedicated to European unity . Its head , the publisher Reinhard Mohn , is trying to do something like Jean Monnet , " the Father of Europe , " did in the 1950 's and 60 's , to prepare the ground for forward leaps with careful studies . Its report said it found the people ahead of their elites in supporting bold measures . <p> But the devoted Europeanists , people like Emilio Colombo of Italy and Leo Tindemans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenge : " Can we found a community without sovereign institutions ? " He answered , " I think I 'll lose . " Still , he and a few others appealed for an organized power that " can sit alongside the U.S. as an equal . " <p> It matters to Europe because the alternative in a time of rapid change risks sliding back to the system prevailing between the two World Wars , a collection of rival states seeking security and support through competing alliances . The idea was to find one 's friend in " the enemy of my enemy , " a formula for disaster . <p> It matters to the U.S. because this could unravel the basis for an orderly new international system , and confound the hopes aroused by the end of the cold war . <p> Nobody wants to go backward . But as the last year has shown , history is not always patient with human reluctance for change and the desire to move gradually . Opportunities lost do n't wait for courage to grasp them . <p> The U.S. ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wisdom nor even the will . It 's having a hard time running itself these days . And yet the world urgently needs sound management , to deal not only with acute new issues such as environment but also with still-virulent old issues - nationalism , power-hunger , ethnic and religious hatreds . <p> A vital , confident and capable European partner is essential . The gulf crisis has again shown the need , and the shortcomings . Time has n't run out yet . The U.S. helped launch Europe on its new path . America 's voice should be raised now to keep it on the track that 's best for both .
