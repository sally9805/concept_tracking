<p> The stock market 's bear may have gone into hibernation , but the bond market variety is all too alive and well . <p> Having endured an August from hell in stocks , investors are enjoying a respite in September . But while many stocks have bounced part way back from their losses , bonds  --  with the conspicuous exception of United States Treasury securities  --  have barely budged . August , one of the most brutal months on record in almost every bond market around the world , has been followed by a September in which most of these securities , even if they are up , have mustered only the merest gains . <p> What happened ? Through no fault of their own , investors in a wide variety of bonds , from convertibles to mortgage-backed securities , found themselves trapped in a game of economic dominoes gone awry . Indeed , the bond market action in August is a painful lesson in how the toppling of one market can , in turn , hurt even the most seemingly unrelated market worlds away . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ default on its debt by the Russian central bank wound up hurting even the most highly rated bonds issued by American corporations with absolutely no exposure to Russia . The only people who escaped the disaster were owners of United States Treasury securities , which were driven to historic highs in price terms as a result of some of the lowest yields in decades . <p> The situation in Russia caused an about-face in the level of risk that professional investors were willing to tolerate . As long as the International Monetary Fund was willing to bail out countries experiencing economic disarray , investors were comfortable investing in fledgling markets . Russia changed all that . <p> " The flight to quality , previously , was out of equities and into bonds , and any bonds qualified , " said Martin Fridson , chief high-yield strategist at Merrill Lynch . " Now that flight is much more pronounced because investors want to go all the way to the ultimate quality of U.S. Treasury securities . Nothing in between seems safe enough . " <p> What did this new risk aversion mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , investors in emerging-market debt lost 28.7 percent of their money , convertible bonds lost 11.8 percent and high-yield bonds lost 7.4 percent of their value . Real estate investment trusts that invest in mortgage securities declined an average 27 percent during the month . Only two non-Treasury sectors showed gains for the period : municipal bonds rose 1.92 percent and the highest-rated corporate bonds inched up 0.51 percent . Treasury bonds , meanwhile , advanced 2.16 percent . <p> Bonds , remember , are supposed to be boring , predictable investments . No more . " We 've probably crammed about a year of volatility into the last six weeks in the bond market , " said Randall C. King , senior vice president for asset liability management at PNC Bank in Pittsburgh . <p> The result of all this volatility has been to bring the issuance of many types of bonds and convertible debt to a near standstill . For example , only one convertible debt issue came to market in all of August . <p> Why does upheaval in one distant market make for losses closer to home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research at Merrill Lynch , explained : " If investors take a hit in one part of their book , their risk tolerance is going to decline across the board . And if everybody does that at roughly the same time , you could see where you 'd get some real liquidity pressure . " <p> Hurt the most by the bear market in bonds are hedge funds that made big bets in emerging-market debt and brokerage firms that trade all manner of bonds for their own accounts . Also taking a hit were commercial banks that trade in the same markets . Adding to the upset , many of these concerns used leverage to make their bets , which magnified their losses . <p> Another piece of bad luck : these big investors typically hedged against losses in emerging-market debt by selling Treasury securities that they did not own . With prices of Treasuries roaring as emerging- market debt plunged , the " hedges " were a disaster as folks found themselves on the wrong side of both of their trades . <p> As a result , word on Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given up all they had made during the first seven months of the year . These departments usually are big money makers for brokerage firms . Last year , for example , Merrill Lynch 's taxable fixed-income department generated nearly $1 billion in revenue , 26 percent of the firm 's overall revenue for principal transactions . <p> This year , however , bonuses for employees in these areas are a dream ; many firms have already conducted what are euphemistically called head-count meetings . Dismissals will follow . <p> For individuals , the unhappy sequence of events in the bond market is all that much harder to take because the losses came when interest rates were declining significantly . Yields on the five-year Treasury note , for example , have fallen one full percentage point in recent weeks . The notes traded at 5.43 percent on July 1 and fell to 4.43 percent on Sept. 11 . Yesterday they were a little higher at 4.67 percent . <p> With rates moving down , investors are understandably confounded by losses in their bond portfolios . After all , does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices rise ? <p> Indeed it does . But Investing 101 could not have predicted the confluence of events  --  the work of professional investors , hedge funds managers and brokerage trading desks which ran away from anything with a whiff of risk to it  --  that have paralyzed worldwide bond markets . As the herd stampeded out of junk bonds , convertible debt , emerging- market bonds , even relatively unrisky corporate issues , buyers for these securities disappeared . <p> Typically , bonds of all kinds trade in tandem . But not in this market ; Treasuries have broken away from the pack . " Everybody 's focused on the decoupling of stocks and bonds , " said Michael Ryan , senior fixed-income strategist at Paine Webber . " What they 're not focused on is the decoupling of fixed income . " <p> All fixed-income securities , whether convertibles , high-yield bonds , AAA-rated corporates or mortgage-backed issues , are traditionally evaluated by how much more their coupons yield than Treasury securities with similar maturities . Because Treasuries are as close to a risk-free investment as there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to attract investors with a higher interest rate than those investors would get if they bought Treasuries . <p> Historically , the average premium at which high-yield bonds , commonly referred to as junk bonds , have traded , for example , is a little under four percentage points higher than similar Treasuries . Now their yields are almost six percentage points higher than Treasuries . <p> But at the end of last year , according to John DeMeo at Salomon Smith Barney , junk bonds traded at a much smaller premium to Treasuries : a little more than two and three-quarter percentage points above the Government 's issues . This narrow spread was the result of yield-starved investors taking as big a gamble as they dared . Those were the days when investors were utterly confident that there was relatively little risk in reaching for that larger return . <p> So , in the months before what was to be a historic flight to quality , the extra spreads for all non-Treasury debt were extremely narrow . When investors fled , they were fleeing from bonds that were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the losses . <p> Each market has , to some degree , slightly different reasons for its troubles . Convertible bonds , for example , are tied to the fortunes of the typically small stocks that are embedded in their values . These shares have been pummeled by the bear market in small-company equities . <p> Junk bonds , because they are issued by companies most vulnerable to problems stemming from declines in corporate profits , may also reflect the recent difficulties in small-company stocks and worries about a recession in the United States . <p> Most investors have probably been unaware of the recent carnage taking place in bonds . That 's because it is a much more disparate and less transparent market than the stock market . While it 's relatively easy to watch the stock market 's ups and downs  --  every move is detailed daily in newspapers , on Internet sites and on cable television shows  --  bond markets are much harder to track . Because information about trades in these markets is not widely available , only professional traders and institutional investors involved in the worldwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfolding there over the past six weeks . <p> Toting up the dollars lost by investors in bonds in August is difficult , too , because of the market 's opaqueness . But some numbers are available : $48 billion was lost in emerging-market debt that was denominated in dollars , $14.6 billion disappeared from portfolios of convertible bonds , another $15 billion was likely lost in junk bonds and $1.67 billion disappeared during the month from an index of real estate investment trusts that invest in mortgage securities . That 's about $80 billion lost . <p> Investors who are not yet aware of the recent turmoil in bonds may get an unpleasant jolt when they check their mutual fund holdings . There are plenty of bondholders out there : as of Sept. 9 , according to AMG Data Services , assets held in bond funds totaled $533 billion , roughly one-fifth the amount currently in stock funds . <p> A paralysis unlike anything investors have seen for years is gripping non-Treasury bond markets in the United States . Investors who think that September 's relative calm in the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a frozen market , where nobody 's selling because there are no buyers . <p> " It 's an over-the-counter market and you 've got to get these guys to pick up the phone , " said Carol Levenson , editor of Gim me Credit , a corporate bond advisory service to institutional investors in Chicago , <p> Dealers at major Wall Street brokerage firms are no longer bidding for bonds from their customers ; they will only take an order if they know they have another customer interested in owning the bonds . And since few investors are interested in adding to their bond positions until they see the market stabilize , most sell orders do n't get executed . <p> As a result , the losses that have been registered in bonds so far probably reflect only a fraction of the real damage done to these markets . If there was actual selling going on , the prices would be far lower . But as long as investors are not forced to sell , the market simply feels ominously quiet . <p> With the year winding down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their holdings . If the market does not rebound by the end of the year , many large firms want to have their trading portfolios whittled down . <p> What might the next few months bring to bond investors ? Do n't expect a big rebound . With Alan Greenspan , the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , declining to elaborate on investors ' hopes that he will cut interest rates at the Sept. 29 meeting , the market in all but Treasuries will likely remain frozen . <p> Widening yield spreads , or premiums paid to investors above the yields of comparable United States Treasury securities , are a sign of concern among investors about risk . Graphs track such spreads for the following bonds : emerging markets , junk , corporate BBB , corporate AAA/AA , and mortgage-backed securities , since the beginning of the year .
