Miss Eloise Bannister owned a house on Florida Street she wanted to stop renting . She wanted to sell it . Or burn it down and collect the insurance , or let it go for taxes . She did not want to scrub the walls again and rake the muck out of the kitchen and lay down new linoleum and fix the faucets . <p> So when the man called up she said , " You could probably get a room over in Payne . Seven miles away . A larger town . " <p> The man was n't interested . " Sounds to me like sleeping on nails . " <p> " Like what ? A nice place like Payne ? " Then she got his meaning . <p> He was thinking Pain ! Payne was a homonym ! Forty years of teaching language in the Grover Public Schools and she 'd never noticed .

" Most of it was weeds . The back part was bushes that formed a little thicket where redbirds nested . Owls took shelter there . On cloudy days it got black as night inside that thicket . " It 's hard work , you know , to keep a yard looking nice . " <p> Hers did n't , not the Florida Street yard or her own that backed up to the thicket and ran on down to Tennessee . The yards had n't looked nice since Mr. Cooper got lame and she had to hire a boy who did n't know beans . <p> " I do n't mind hard work , " the man replied . " And I have plenty time .

New people moving in . I know they need houses . " <p> " But you need to sell . " <p> " I do n't need to , Grace . " Grace was trying again to find out about her finances , if she had any money beyond her teacher retirement . <p> " I 'm just tired of taking care of it , getting broken things fixed and dealing with deadbeats . " <p> " He might not be a deadbeat . You could hardly tell over the telephone . " <p> " He sounded very nice . " <p> " He looked nice , too . " <p> " What do you mean ?

We 'll go up on the porch and have a talk . " <p> " This is my bucket , Eloise . I brought it from home . And what about these figs ?

" <p> " If you were worried , Grace , you should have said so . " <p> " I was n't worried . I 've been stung by wasps ten thousand times . What I 'm calling to tell you is to lock up your house . Maggie told that Brown man where you live . Straight through the block from the Florida house . On Tennessee . A woman alone . " <p> " Did she tell him that too ?

Sissy had a baby girl last Wednesday morning at four o'clock and nobody called . " <p> " Would you have wanted them to at four o'clock ? " <p> " They could have waited till seven . Instead they waited two days and I still had to go and find out myself . After all the presents I 've given that girl . " <p> " I 'm sorry , Grace . I expect they forgot in their excitement . " <p> " Well , do n't you forget about locking up . " <p> " I lock my doors every night at nine . " <p> " I lock mine at eight . Earlier than that if there 's a strange man in town , nosing around . " <p> " You never did tell me why Mr. Brown was at Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , Eloise . He was out on the sidewalk . That 's all there was to it . " <p> " Did he stop just to chat ? " <p> " He stopped , " said Grace , " to ask about the rent house next door to Maggie . " <p> " The Blackman house ? He would n't want that . " <p> " That 's what Maggie told him . Then she told him about your place . " <p> " You can tell her next time that my place is for sale . " <p> " Tell her yourself . She 'd love to hear from her favorite teacher . " <p> " Her favorite teacher was Isabel Martin . " <p> " Well , I ca n't argue about it now . My program is on . " <p> " Do you think I 'm keeping you ? You called me !

String bean type . Cap on his head . " Good morning ma'am . " <p> Eloise stared , something she had taught children never to do . <p> " Excuse the hour . " He crossed the grass . " But I saw you were out . " Out in her nightgown ! But at least it was n't one of those seethroughs . " I came out early to beat the birds . " <p> He nodded approvingly . " Birds do love figs . " He was a man about seventy . Or seventy-five and well preserved . On the telephone he had sounded forty . <p> How had she sounded ? <p> She stood up straight , like a woman , she hoped , who had on underwear . " Mr. Brown , " she said . She was pleased to see him jump . " As I mentioned on the phone , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " With a hole in the roof ? " <p> Eloise jumped . <p> He said more gently , " You did n't hear the wind ? Blowing hard in the night ? " <p> She had n't heard anything . She had gone to sleep thinking how paranoid Grace was and had n't waked up until the clock in the living room was striking six . <p> " A good-sized limb struck your porch . " <p> " A limb , " she said . Why not lightning ? " I 'd better go and see . " She set off grimly in the direction of the thicket . <p> Brown came after her . " We 'll go in my truck . " Without laying a finger on her he herded her toward it and got her in . <p> She came to herself when he slammed the door . " Wait ! " she said . " I have to go in the house and get my wrapper .

" <p> " You ca n't see from here . " He drove around the back . " Look up yonder . " <p> The limb lay on the roof like a torn-off leg . <p> " I do n't see a hole . " <p> " It 's the size of a skateboard . I climbed up and looked . " <p> " You climbed my roof ? " <p> " On a ladder , of course . I carry a ladder .

" He shot her a grin . <p> " Found some , too . " <p> " Mr. Brown , " she said , " you have n't been hired . " She was nearly naked and foolishly seated in this man 's truck , but she said it anyway , and said something else . " What are you up to ? " <p> He looked straight at her . " Up to filling my time . " <p> She had stared down enough schoolboys to think she could believe him . " You 've been riding around this morning , searching for damages ? " <p> " On the chance . Yes , ma'am . " <p> " Stop calling me ma'am ! I 'm not a hundred . " <p> " Did n't think you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be seventy . " <p> " That 's wrong too .

" <p> " A fair and honest price . You can count on that . " <p> " Make it fifty dollars and you can do it . " <p> " Make it sixty-five , depending on the decking . And extra , of course , if I have to buy nails . " <p> Eloise walked home . She insisted on that in case Grace was up , looking out a window . She told Abel Brown she walked around barefoot to strengthen her arches , but on the path through the thicket the lie about killed her . She had to sit down twice , once on the bench where she read her devotionals , and one more time on the stump of an ash tree where fire ants bit her on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got to her house , she took a cold bath mixed with baking soda and did n't eat breakfast until a quarter of nine . <p> " I 'm all off schedule , " she told Grace when Grace called up to see why she was at home and not at the library . She went every Friday , over to Payne , to check in books and check out more . <p> " I 'm leaving right now . " She drove around the block . Mr. Brown was n't visible , but his truck was there . She said out loud . " Sixty-five bucks , like money is water . " <p> In Payne she discovered the library closed . For roof repairs . " Wind damage , " a man said , standing on the sidewalk . <p> She drove home bitterly and went to the store for fire ant bait , and lemons and sugar and jars for preserves . She had to go back for corn pads and Tums and to stop at the post office and run by the bank . At one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batch scorched because Grace telephoned to see who was hammering . <p> " Mr. Brown ? " she said . " My , you 're a fast worker ! " <p> Eloise explained , leaving out the nightgown . " I have to go , Grace . I 'm cooking preserves . " <p> " Did you peel the figs ? " <p> " I like the peeling left on . " <p> " Tell me this : do you think he 's handsome ? " <p> Eloise heard the lawnmower sometime later . She had paraffin melting and could n't go out . At four-thirty she went , crossing her lawn beautifully cut ) and passing through the thicket where she threw down ant bait . Emerging at the rent house , she found the grass mowed there , the roof mended , and the truck leaving with the broken-off limb . <p> " Mr. Brown ! " she called . <p> Mr. Brown hopped out . " Miss Bannister , " he said , " you 're wearing shoes . " <p> " A few hours barefoot is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a nice-looking man , in an elderly way . And a gentleman , too , or else he would have mentioned clothes as well as shoes . <p> " The roof looks nice , " Eloise told him . <p> " It 's going to look better when those new shingles weather . " <p> " You mowed both lawns . " <p> " I like mowing lawns . " <p> " You 're hauling off the limb . " <p> " That 's part of the roof job . " <p> " Well , that 's very nice , " Eloise said . <p> " Well , I 'll see you tomorrow . " <p> Her brain spun around . " Tomorrow ? What for ? I 'll pay you now . " <p> She opened her purse , a little snap-mouthed affair her mother once carried . A miser 's purse , Grace liked to call it . " How much do I owe you ? " <p> " No hurry , " he said . " One or two things still need to be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I 'm paying for . " <p> " Step around here . I 'll show you something . " <p> He pointed out the screens . " These screens are torn . " <p> " I 've noticed , " she said . <p> " Have you noticed the steps ? " He put a foot through one without the least effort . " It 's things like this that bring down the price when you sell a place . " <p> " I know , Mr. Brown , but I am not putting money into this house . " <p> " You have to put money in to get money out . " <p> Eloise sighed . This sweet little house was her parents ' honeymoon cottage . Hers , too , she once imagined . Had she imagined it since ? <p> Maybe one or two times before she was fifty . Or whenever it was her periods stopped . <p> " Look , " Brown said . Another step crumbled . <p> If she burned the place down she might go to jail . " How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Abel Brown clutched his throat . " I 'll be glad to tell you over a drink of water . " <p> Mr. Brown stayed for supper . <p> He played the violin . Her father 's violin that she kept on a shelf in the living room . She sat him down in there because the kitchen was a wreck : jars of fig preserves all over the drainboard , dirty pots in the sink and shiny places on the floor their shoes stuck to . <p> He did n't play well . Old strings , he said . But he brought out a certain note now and then that put a lump in her throat and she let him go on though it drove her crazy . <p> She apologized ten times for having him work all day without any water . He told her eleven times he did have water . He had a whole jug full , but he drank it all up . He 'd only been dry , he said , for thirty minutes . <p> Thirty minutes was too long , Eloise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . Size sixteen was what she guessed . Big hands , too , floating over the violin , tucking it under his chin . <p> He stopped playing at last and told her quietly , " I 'm going to get your supper . " <p> " Why , what do you mean ? " She jumped out of her chair where she had been sort of dreaming , going up a ladder into somebody 's attic . <p> " You ca n't cook in that kitchen . " <p> She did n't tell him she had n't intended to . She ate cereal for supper with a banana sliced over it . Tonight she had planned to eat a cantaloupe . <p> " Where will you get it ? " she croaked out at him . <p> " I 'll drive over to Payne . " <p> " Seven miles , " she marveled . <p> " They have a deli over there at a convenience store . " <p> He had learned about Payne since yesterday . " It 's not a big deli . " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper ? " <p> In her embarrassment she said , " Get enough for yourself . " <p> While he was gone she slammed things around and cleaned up the kitchen . She put a cloth on the table and got out napkins . Feeling like a fool , she went outside and picked a bouquet of blue plumbago , knowing while she did it the blooms would drop off and the prickly stuff underneath would latch onto everything . <p> Of course Grace was out , picking up twigs . She called across the street , " Did you finish your figs ? " <p> " Yes , they 're fine . " <p> " I 'll come have a look . " <p> " I 'm expecting Mr. Brown in just a few minutes . " <p> " Mr. Brown ? " Grace halted . <p> " I have to pay him for his work . " " Are you giving him flowers ? " <p> " I 'm trimming the bush . " <p> " Oh , " said grace . " Well , have a good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point . <p> Mr. Brown brought shrimp , boiled and peeled , and potato salad . Men , she had been told , love potato salad . She herself seldom bought it , and never in hot weather for fear of ptomaine . Possibly the shrimp were tainted , too , though they tasted all right . If later in the night she had to get up and go to the hospital , she had a clean gown and an insurance policy . <p> " Miss Eloise , " Brown said when he had eaten the cantaloupe she served for dessert . " Driving over to Payne I had a thought about your house . " <p> " Did you ? " she said . They had drunk a little wine from an old green bottle she had opened at Christmas and now he was filling their glasses again . <p> " You know I live in a trailer . " <p> She did n't know , but she said , " How nice . " <p> " It 's not any bigger than a sardine can . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " You 've been traveling ? " she said . <p> " Traveling all over . " <p> " What made you stop here ? " <p> " I came down the highway and saw the lake . " <p> Full of dirty brown water , Eloise thought . If she were able to travel , she would go to the mountains . <p> " I 'm parked in that camp next to the bridge . It 's not a bad spot , but I 'm sick of that trailer . " <p> Eloise sipped wine . " I ca n't rent you my house . I 'm sorry , Abel . " Abel , she heard . Heard it leap from her lips like a frog in a fairy tale . <p> " Eloise . " He smiled . " I 'm going to help you sell it . " <p> " Are you in real estate too ? " <p> " I have a proposition . " <p> " A proposition ! " <p> " A business deal . " He patted her hand , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I worked it out on the way to Payne . " <p> She calmed down slowly when she heard what it was . <p> He had an idea he would live in her house . Instead of paying rent , he would renovate it . <p> " Insane , " she said . <p> " Room by room . I 'll start in the kitchen . I 'll tear out the sink and then do the cabinets . " <p> " You 'll do no such thing . " <p> " You ca n't sell a house that 's falling down and get anything for it . " <p> " I 'll sell it that way or not at all . " <p> " Just listen a minute . " <p> " No , " she said . <p> He got the violin and picked out a few notes . " It 's a honeymoon cottage . " <p> She came to attention . " How did you know ? " <p> " They all have that look . " <p> " There are others ? " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down the violin and tried her preserves from a dish on the stove left out as a sample . " Is there lemon in this ? " <p> " Of course there 's lemon . " <p> " But no vanilla ? " <p> " Certainly not , " <p> He sat down again and said like a grandfather , " Eloise . You have a fine house you 're letting rot down . " <p> The lump came back . " How can I help it ? " <p> " You did n't listen . I 'm offering free my priceless labor . " <p> " And materials ? " she said . " Are those free too ? If I wanted to do it , I ca n't spare the money . " <p> " Borrow it , dear . " <p> " I never borrow . " <p> " Your credit 's no good ? " <p> " I do n't owe a cent and never intend to . " <p> " Oh , too bad . " He seemed truly sorry . " You 're squeezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I have supported myself for a good many years ! " <p> " And nicely , I 'm sure , but you might have done better if you 'd sold this big house and moved to the small one . " <p> " You 're full of ideas . " <p> " Good ones , too . " He plucked again on the strings of the violin . <p> " Do you know that song , ' The Beautiful Old Things ' ? " <p> " No , I do n't . " <p> " I do n't either . I wish I did . " He got out of his chair and strolled to the door . " Thank you , Miss El , for an interesting evening . You 'll understand if I move along now . " <p> " Wait , " she said . " I want to give you your money . " She turned to get it . When she turned back around he was already gone . <p> She did n't sleep all night . Her thoughts ran amok like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went out to the kitchen to clear a place in the pantry to put the preserves . Then she mopped the floor and sat in the dark with the violin . At the first sign of day she put on a housecoat and slippers and went to the thicket . <p> Above her bench a redbird was singing . <p> " Cheer up , yourself ! " she told the bird . " You do n't have a house that 's falling down . Or a head like a pumpkin from Christmas wine . " <p> She stared at her feet speckled with ant bites . What should she do ? Keep saving her money for Death With Dignity ? Keep putting aside for The Lingering Illness , for women coming in to cook and clean and trim her chin whiskers and privately bathe her ? <p> Or should she blow it ? Spend it all reviving the cottage . New sinks , new screens , no telling what . <p> Was it only yesterday she was picking figs when Abel Brown drove up in her yard ? <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She saw through the bushes his descent from the truck , his strides toward the porch . He began prying boards off the steps . Like he owned the place ! <p> She jumped up and burst through the yaupon . " What are you doing ? " <p> " This has to be fixed . " He seemed unsurprised that she had appeared . " I 'm doing it now and getting it done with . " <p> She saw a diagrammed sentence up in the air , with dangling off like an extra foot . " It 's the Sabbath , " she said . <p> " Ca n't a fellow pull nails out of boards on the Sabbath ? " <p> " People are sleeping ! " <p> " I bet in Payne they 're not . " He laughed at his pun . " All right . Come on . Let 's go and drink coffee till the sleepers get up . " <p> " This is twice you 've pulled this , " Eloise complained . He was toasting bread without even asking . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El ? " He buttered the toast and spread on figs . " What 's going to happen to all those jars of this wonderful stuff ? " <p> " I give them for Christmas . " <p> " That 's a long way off . Christmas , " he said . <p> " You may take one now if that 's what you 're wanting . " <p> " That 's it , all right . Cold winter mornings figs 'll sure taste good . " <p> Eloise sat and wondered : where will he be when winter comes on ? In Florida maybe . Or in the Florida Street house ? She saw it happening like a train bearing down on Eloise Bannister tied to the tracks . <p> " I told you a lie , " she said without meaning to . <p> " About your money ? " He looked over his cup . " You have some , do you ? " <p> " Of course I do . A woman alone . Who would look after me ? " <p> " The government , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good man . " <p> " I 'm past all that .

" Funnier still , I could be BrownBannister . " <p> " Miss El ! " he said . " Do you want to discuss it ? " <p> " Certainly not ! " <p> " That 's worse than ma'am , saying certainly not all the time . " He went to the pantry . " Did you say two jars ? " <p> He came out with three . " I lied to you , too . " He set the jars on the tabletop . " I did n't plan the renovation on the way to buy supper . I planned it all day , even down to the colors . Confederate blue in both the bedrooms .

" I 'll pay you what I owe you and there wo n't be any need to come back at all . " <p> A stillness came over him . " If that 's how you want it , it 's sixty dollars . " <p> " Did you have to buy decking ? " <p> " Nails have gone up . " <p> She took her snap-mouthed purse out of a cabinet . " I 'm paying you seventy . " <p> " Suit yourself , but I might say this .

In the late afternoon she slipped off to Payne and went to the movies . And then ate shrimp and potato salad . <p> He would come back , of course . To get his preserves . <p> By Tuesday he had n't . Wednesday either . <p> She got in her car and drove to the bridge . Across the water she could see the trailers lined up in the camp . Which was his ? Where was his truck ? <p> She came home and telephoned . <p> The attendant told her he pulled out Monday . <p> " What 's the matter with you ?

" <p> " In that case , " said Grace , " I think I baked it . " She turned back to Eloise . " I know what would help . If you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Oh , I do n't think so . " <p> Grace persisted . Her view of the matter was that Abel Brown was a competent con man whose only aim was to get the cottage . <p> " Get it ? " said Eloise . " What do you mean ? " <p> " Own it , " said Grace . " Fix it up and sell it and scoot out of town . " <p> Eloise felt better , hearing this nonsense . " He could n't sell it . I have the deed . " <p> " He could marry you , could n't he ? " <p> " If I were drugged and shackled ! " <p> " You 're sounding more and more like a woman in love . " <p> " It is n't love ! It 's not even affection . If it 's anything , it 's loneliness , Grace . " <p> " I 'm lonely too . But I would n't dive off the high board just to cure it . " <p> " No cures have been offered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he worked things . Smooth as a tick 's back , mowing your lawn , buying your supper . " <p> " Schemes , do you think ? Right at the start I asked what he was up to . " <p> " What did he say ? " <p> " He likes to fill his time . " <p> Grace snickered . " Any fool can lie . He looks like a man who would stop at nothing . " <p> " How can you tell ? " <p> " By the way he walks . " <p> " Oh yes , I see . One foot , then the other . " <p> " Use your common sense , Eloise . " <p> " Do you think I have any ? " <p> " You have more than me . " <p> Eloise was astonished . " Am I hearing things ? " <p> " Of the two of us , you 're the practical one . I rely on you . " <p> " After today , you 'll think twice about that . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human . " <p> " I did n't before ? " <p> " Not as much as most people . You always have answers to everything . " <p> " Grace , that 's ridiculous . " <p> " It 's not your fault . Teaching does it . Have n't you noticed ? Teachers get bossy . " <p> " It 's getting late , Grace . It 's time for supper . " <p> " Are you asking me to eat or telling me to leave ? " Grace got up . <p> " Whichever , I 'm going . It 's Bingo night . " <p> She paused beside Eloise . " Do you think after this I could call you Ellie ? " <p> " Not this week . Probably never . " <p> " There , " sais Grace . " That 's what I mean <p> On Thursday Eliose went around in her wrapper , reading old letters and playing the piano . She put a Vicks plaster on her chest and then peeled it off . <p> On Friday she dressed and went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know it . She wandered around , reading blurbs on the mysteries until somebody said , " Here 's Mr. Brown 's water . Who 's going to take it ? " <p> " Mr. Brown who ? " It popped out like a frog . <p> " Up on the roof . " <p> " I 'll take it , " she said . " I 'm going that way " <p> He had barely come down before she was after him . <p> " It 's too high up there for a man of your age ! " <p> " Why , Miss El , " he said , " you 've put on your shoes and stepped out of your bailiwick . " <p> " Because I read , " she told him severely . <p> " I read , too . That 's how I found out there was work over here . " <p> " Have you moved your trailer here ? " <p> " To the Family Campground , where I 'm slightly out of place , but nevertheless . " He shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " She steered him to a tree . " Are you trying to kill yourself ? It 's ninety degrees . " <p> " It 's a hundred and twenty up on the roof . " <p> " Then quit and go home ! " <p> " I 'd rather die up there than cooped-up somewhere in a nursing home . " <p> " You are n't ready to die . " <p> " The trouble is , when you do get ready , they rarely let you . " <p> Eloise pressed on . " You forgot your preserves . " <p> He lifted gray eyebrows . " Is it safe to come get it ? " <p> " Come about four . You can fix the steps . " <p> Eloise fixed a picnic and took it out when the hammering stopped . <p> She meant for them to eat on the cottage lawn , but they ate in the thicket because an early thrush mixed up on the seasons was singing its heart out and she wanted to hear . <p> They sat on her bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " This is good , " Abel said about baked beans and wieners . <p> " Try some of this . " Mustard chow-chow she had made herself . <p> With the meal underway , she made an announcement . " I have halfway decided you can live in my house . " <p> " Halfway ? " he said . <p> " I have to know first if you 're a con man . " <p> He whooped at that . " Do you think if I was I 'd tell you yes ? " <p> " Are you or are n't you ? Tell me straight ? " <p> " I am not a con man . " <p> " You understand , do n't you , what I mean by that ? " <p> " I think I do . A liar and a cheat who might slicker you out of whatever you own . " <p> " That 's it exactly . " She folded her hands . " And you say you are n't ? Can I believe you ? " <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> She ate the banana she had previously intended to slice over cereal and eat in the kitchen . " Grace says it all fits together for you to be crooked . " <p> " Grace ? " He frowned . " Grace across the street ? Who ducks into the garage when she thinks I 've seen her ? " <p> " She thinks your walk gives you away , that you were smooth as a tick 's back , the way you worked me . " <p> He nodded agreeably . " I did some of that . " <p> " Mowing the lawns ? Bringing me supper ? " <p> " And playing the violin . I thought you 'd enjoy it . " <p> " You did n't play well . " <p> " I played well enough to put you to sleep . " He ate a cracker . " I worked you another time , to get the preserves . " <p> " Grace thinks you want to get my house . " <p> " I want to live in it awhile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " What if you like it ? " <p> " Maybe I 'll buy it . " <p> " Do you have any money ? " <p> " Enough , " he said . <p> The bird sang again from a farther place , whistling purer than air or water . <p> Eloise said : " What have you been doing for most of your life ? " <p> " Smoking for one thing . But I gave it up . " He leaned back and thought . " I drilled oil wells . I built a few houses . Mostly , " he said , " I 've gone around looking . " He gave her a grin . " For more lawns to mow . What about you ? " <p> " I 've been right here . Teaching , " she said . " And picking figs . " <p> " Why did n't you marry ? " <p> " Why should I marry ? I was in love with teaching . And I had my parents . " She picked a leaf and folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape of the year ? " <p> " The year ? " He chuckled . " I ca n't say I have . " <p> " Have you never noticed that it 's winter on one end and on the other end too ? " <p> He took her hand , a child 's hand in the palm of his , and squeezed it lightly . " If you were in charge , how would you arrange it ? " <p> " I 'd start with summer and end with spring . " She let his thumb trace the moons of her fingernails , though her mouth was dry and her heart was knocking . " Grace says- " He gave a mild groan . " She says I ought to know you longer before I trust you . " <p> " You can tell Grace people our age ca n't waste time on long engagements . " <p> " Engagements ! " she said . <p> " Just a manner of speaking , Eloise . " <p> " We are not engaged . " <p> " We are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm down before she spoke again . " Have you ever been married ? " <p> " Once , " he said . " For about thirty minutes . " <p> " Why did n't it last ? " <p> " We did n't like each other . " <p> " Abel , " she said , " you may live in my cottage if you tell me truthfully you have no interest in making a match . " <p> " A match . " He smiled . " You mean like a couple ? Miss El , " he said . <p> " I will never legally or criminally seize your house . " <p> " It 's not the house alone . " She went ahead fearfully . " It 's what you might think because I 'm letting you live in it . " <p> " I might think you care for me . " <p> " Yes , " she said . " I would n't want to mislead you . " <p> He chuckled again . " You do n't care for me . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would you care to explain ? " <p> " I 'm not sure I can . " <p> " Try , why do n't you ? " <p> She started slowly and gathered steam . " I 've lived by myself for too many years . I have to have my own room . I like to read late . I get up and take medicine . And I 'm used to playing the radio all night if I want . " <p> He waited quietly . <p> " And sex , " she burst out with a bravery unknown to her . " The very idea of it gives me a stomachache . " <p> " Scares you , " he said . <p> " Scares me to death . " <p> They listened to the bird in the thicket again . When it flew , Abel said , " I 've lived by myself most of my life . I need my own room . I watch TV until two in the morning . I get up and take walks . And sex at my age is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Eloise , " I 'm glad that 's settled . " <p> " It 's good , " he agreed , " to have it out of the way . " <p> They sat awhile longer . When the fireflies came out she began putting things in the picnic hamper . <p> " Would you like more tea ? " <p> " Tea ? No , thank you . " He stopped her hands from folding the tablecloth . " Tell me again about your year . " <p> " I 'd start it in June . " <p> " So that would mean that right about now it 's the middle of January ? " <p> " Yes . " She laughed . " Ca n't you tell it 's cooler ? " <p> " By July , your time , I 'll be through with the house . Is that long enough to get over a scare ? " <p> " Six months ? Oh , no . No , I do n't think so . " <p> " How long will it take ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Dear girl , " he soothed , " July is Christmas . " <p> " I mean next year . " <p> " Miss El , " he whispered . He put an arm around her . " I would never rush you but by any calendar it 's time we kissed . " <p> " Oh , Abel , we ca n't ! It 's not dark yet . " <p> " Close your eyes , sweetheart , and you 'll see that it is . " <p>
