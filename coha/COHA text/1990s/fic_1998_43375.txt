SO WE TELEPORT FOR THE holidays to a world where everyone is required to carry a huge fishbowl all of the time . It takes both hands to hold the heavy bowl , and once you 're holding it , there 's no way to let go . The fish in the bowl is a barking goldfish . It likes to eat spiders . The so-called Kamikaze spider is as big as a basketball , and it always goes for your face . Once you have a spider trying to suck out your eyes , you have very little time to perform the only course of action open to you . What you must do is plunge your head into the bowl so your barking goldfish can eat the Kamikaze spider . None of this was explained in the brochure . <p> Also big news to us is the fact that this is a world where the dimension necessary for long distance telepathy is missing . Just as sound can not cross a vacuum , here thoughts do not travel in the ether . I could beam my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it would n't do any good . <p> What we must do is somehow touch heads . If we can touch heads I can ask her if maybe we should n't get out of here . If she agrees , and I ca n't imagine that she wo n't , we can hotfoot it through the forest and across the creek to the exit portal which if I 'm not mistaken I can actually see from here . Touching heads , however , is going to be a big problem , since we 're both holding these really big fishbowls . <p> The sky is sea green , and the puffy pink clouds racing across it move too quickly to really be clouds , not that I thought there were clouds in the first place , since we came to know everything we needed to know about this world as soon as we popped into existence here . None of it makes me feel like singing Christmas carols . <p> I suppose I could just take off running . Would she get the idea and follow ? Or would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was like all along and that I 'd lured her here to abandon her ? <p> I cluck my tongue at her trying to get her attention so she 'll come over here so maybe we can touch heads , but she 's looking around fearfully like something might jump out of the feather duster trees and grab her , and the look on her face would be funny and adorable , oh you silly goose , if it were not the case that her fears are entirely justified . Even the little bugs on this world are as big as your feet . <p> She finally sees me making faces at her and comes over and our fishbowls clink together as we try to go head to head . Our fish thrash around barking like crazy and snapping at each other through the glass . Whenever we lean in to touch , the fish leap up out of the water and nip at our chins . Boy , if I ever do manage to get a thought in edgewise what I 'll think is maybe we should have opted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rented uncle albert singing drunken sailor songs and fruit cake and santa clause and colored lights and disappointed children and eggnog . <p> I walk around her hoping we can touch from the rear , but as it turns out , and this is not something I 'd realized earlier , our butts are almost perfectly matched heightwise . And the bowls are so heavy . I ca n't lean far enough back to touch my head to hers without spilling water out of my fishbowl , and if I spilled too much water and the fish got stressed and became maybe moody and lethargic , who would eat the Kamikaze spider surely even now tensing for a leap at my face ? <p> I feel a sudden flash of irritation , and I 'm glad we did n't connect just then . Otherwise we might have exchanged unkind remarks about our respective butts . <p> I move to her side but no matter how we arrange ourselves we can not connect . Front to back ? iNTo good . All we do is produce a clinking clanking splashing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connection we have always had suddenly becomes desperate as I realize , and I can see it in her eyes that it has dawned upon her too , that we may never hook up again . We could be stranded and alone like this forever . We spend a couple of minutes jumping around making hopeless and helpless hooting sounds , grunts and cries , whimpers and finally barks not too different from the barks of our goldfish . <p> Then there is a quiet moment . The eye of the storm . And then we panic . I ca n't see her fishbowl ; I can only see her . She fills my vision , and nothing matters as much as our reunion . I can not rationally appraise the danger we face as we rush together and meet like belly-bumping cowboys and our bowls shatter and our fish fall into the high grass , and she wet , slippery and shivering rushes into my arms . <p> There is a momentary riot of chewing sounds from the grass , and then the worldwide bug symphony that I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above us like a fastforward weather report . Those black drops dropping will probably be spiders . <p> I pull her in close and we touch heads , and in an explosion of color and big bands , jungle orchids and satin cat feet up and down my spine , it 's like a big part of your mind has just wondered off whistling , and now it 's back and all the pieces snap into place , a cosmic ah ha and she me we spiral down and down to a perfect state of not quite seamless sameness , the two of us , the one of us . You can phone your congressperson , and you can write a letter to the editor . You can curse your luck , and you can shake your fist at the sky . You can drop to your knees in an eleventh hour appeal to magic . But in the end there is really only this . <p> We make a dash for it . <p>                 @ @ @ @
