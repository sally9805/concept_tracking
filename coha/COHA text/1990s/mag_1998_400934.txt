Take a break with low-tech bass . Photograph Bass bugging may not yield the biggest-or the miost-fish , but it sure is fun . // Their names ring as if from a fireman 's carnival on a small-town Saturday night . Step right up , get your Calcasieu Pig Boat . Fries with that ? Watch the Desperate Diver . Jive along with Dancing Frog . Here 's where Sneaky Pete takes your money , Weedless Willard takes your choice . Your choice of bass , that is , since these are modern bass bugs with playful names that symbolize the general funkiness and fun of taking bass on a fly rod . This kind of fishing is decidedly low-tech and laid back-a pause that refreshes , an antidote for metalflake run-and-gun . It 's the way bass fishing used to be , and that 's its fundamental appeal . You may not catch the most fish or the biggest , but you just might have the most fun . Getting into the game is simple ; catching fish consistently is not . Following a few easy rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days is generally measured by lots of dollar signs , but bass fly tackle is the happy exception . Low-end fly rods with typically moderate to slow actions are a better choice than their highspeed , high-end counterparts . That 's because most bass bugs are bulky and air-resistant , and you 'll kill your arm trying to rifle gobs of deerhair through the air with a stiff , high-tech stick . Slower-casting rods rely more on line mass than velocity to get the job done right , and that kind of deliberate , rocking-chair casting stroke is easy on your elbow . If you are going to use a stiffer rod-many bonefish or salmon rods see double-duty on bass water , for example-overline the rod by one or two sizes to slow it down . Use enough rod . Nine feet is the basic rod length , in weights 7 or 8 for smallmouth water or for largemouths weighing no more than a few pounds in relatively open water . Six-weight and lighter rods wo n't carry most bass bugs well in the air . For largemouths in or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang a horse-you 'll want to go heavier . Nine- to 12-weight rods allow more pulling power in case you have to try and stop a fish as it bulldogs for cover . Then , too , if you 're deliberately seeking larger fish , you 'll probably be using jumbo , double-ought bugs , which cast most easily with heavier line sizes . Reels can be basic and inexpensive , serving primarily for rod balance and line storage because bass as a rule do n't run very far . The old favorite Medalist ( at about $35 ) will serve a bass-fishing lifetime and will also survive being dropped on a rock-an acid test that many newer , high-tech reels fail miserably . Match reel size to your line size according to box label or catalog description , spool up with the maker 's recommended amount of Dacron backing , then add a premiumgrade , bass-taper floating line . Bass tapers have an exaggerated weight-forward bias that makes for easier casting with big bugs . Skimp anywhere you like , except on the line . Better lines cost about $40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing easier and more productive . Leaders can likewise be simple . When lazy or in a hurry , I 've often used just a 5-foot length of 12- or 14-pound-test monofilament , which can work adequately because of the forceful turnover possible with bass-taper lines . But tapered leaders will help deliver your bug more smoothly , so look for tapered , knotless bass leaders with heavy butts in the .023- to .025-inch range . No knots means your leader will gather less pond goo on the retrieve , of course , and the ideal lineleader connection is a needle-nail knot with a thin , smooth coat of Pliobond for the same reason . I happen to be rigged with 6-foot , 12-pound-test tapered bass leaders from Cortland at the moment , which stretch less than 9-footers and thus allow harder hooksets in bass jungles . Clearwater and educated bass often demand longer and finer leaders , however . That covers your floating-line outfit , and that 's usually where I stop . I might use a sinking-tip or fullsinking line to swing a Woolly Bugger deep for river smallmouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righteous strikes on a surface or near-surface bug fished on a floating line . Although it 's possible to use specialized sinking lines to fish as far down as 30 feet for bass on deep reservoir structure , I think that pushes the envelope beyond reasonable postage . In that case , switch back to spinning or baitcasting gear . On the Water The best bass bugging is a shallow-water game , which means silence is platinum as you stalk fish amid pads and stumps . Talk or laugh all you want-the fish ca n't hear you-but do n't splash the oars or bang your bug box around with your feet . If wading , take your time and move slowly . Fish nearby targets like logs or pad pockets carefully , casting out to 50 feet or so , and then move again rather than force longer casts , bungling the effort . That kind of detailed attention will catch you more fish , but it 's useless unless you avoid the one big mistake that costs fly anglers more missed bass than anything else . You absolutely must fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there are ny curves , slack , or wiggles in the line , you ca n't york the bug properly , nor can you get a good hookset on a sudden strike . Even experienced anglers often miss this point , but you do n't have to . Here 's how it works . // GETTING A BETTER BACKCAST FINDING THE RIGHT BASS BUGS // After your cast lands on target , lower the rod tip to he water 's surface . That means right down on the ater , not a few inches above . Put the fly line under : he index finger of your casting hand and work the bug with left-hand strips made behind your rightand grip . Do n't twitch , bounce , or wave the rod tip around . All the bug 's action comes from your lefthand line pulls-long or short , fast or slow . With the rod tip on the water and line straight to the bug , a 3inch pull moves the bug 3 inches . If your rod tip is a little above the surface , that small curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of your line pulls , which kills the bug 's action . And of course that straight line allows quicker , more powerful hooksets when you need to react in a hurry . Sure , it sounds simple ; but you would n't believe how many eople get it wrong . Do n't take it for granted . Get our rod tip down and keep it there . The right retrieve speeds for surface bugs have been debated at least since the Civil War , but there 's an easy answer . Actually , two answers . First , always start with the least intrusive-least water-disturbingretrieve style . You can wake the fish up later if this does n't work . That means gentle twitches with sliding bugs or soft , intermittent blips with a popper . Slower is better for starters , even when fishing marabou streamers or hair-strip worm flies in shallow water . For a good lesson , watch nearby frogs as you sit quietly in your canoe . If undisturbed , they 'll swim a few inches , then stop . Then swim . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second answer is also an axiom : Experiment . And keep experimenting with different combinations of bug styles and retrieves until you hit the twitch du jour . Being able to vary both rhythm and speed is critical . On some days bass will come only to streamers sashayed with a South Side blues beat ; other days need poppers played in waltz time .
