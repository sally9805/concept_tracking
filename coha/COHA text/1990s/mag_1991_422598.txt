<p> USE YOUR ILLUSION I USE YOUR ILLUSION II Guns n ' Roses Geffen <p> <p> THE ILLUSION ' TWINS WOULD have been major contenders for Album(s) of the Year honors even if they 'd never been released . It was all in the waiting - and the drama of watching a band do its fucking-up in public . Surprisingly , the wait was worth it , more than we had any right to expect from an overstuffed four-album-equivalent grab bag of re-recordings ( Civil War , ' Knockin ' on Heaven 's Door ' ' ) , club-days leftovers ( Do n't Cry ' ' ) , indulgent epic ballads ( November Rain ' ' ) , dubiously chosen covers ( Live and Let Die ' ' ) and parental advisory ' raveups ( take your pick ) . Neither Illusion is up to the measure of Appetite for Destruction ; they both lack that album 's intensely focused vehemence and riffy pith . But for damn-the-consequences attitude and sprawling Exile on Main Street-meets-Love It to Death ferocity , the two Illusions vividly capture what Rose accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a socio-psychotic state of bliss . ' Illusion II has been the better seller , and it boasts two of the Gunners ' four or five finest moments , You Could Be Mine ' and Civil War . ' It 's also heavy on blowhard bluster , like the anti-Vince Neil diatribe Shotgun Blues ' and Get in the Ring , ' a paranoiac , below-the-belt tirade against rock mags . But Illusion I is the better record on the strength of Axl Rose 's explosive daze ' n ' rage address Do n't Damn Me ' and the careening suicide nightmare Coma . ' The great Layla ' ' - style instrumental tag at the end of November Rain , ' highlighted by Slash 's soaring lead guitar , makes it worth wading through the rest of the song 's clunky Elton John pretensions . Back Off Bitch , ' though , is a waste of a great rocker . There are at least a million ways in rock &; roll to say **36;675;TOOLONG . Back Off Bitch ' is the two-bit punk 's way out .

That 's particularly true in the case of the James Brown box , which is a sampler 's paradise , as well as a vibrant distillation of Brown 's four-decade odyssey as Mr. Please Please , the Godfather of Soul , the New New Minister of Super Heavy Funk and the Original Disco Man . Star Time also gives you a lot more of what you 've been funkin ' for all these years , featuring a number of classic singles like Mother Popcorn ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been restored to their original sweaty six- and seven-minute glory by producer Harry Weinger . <p> Bob Dylan already put out his Star Time five years ago ; it was called Biograph . This first installment in his new archival Bootleg line is more like a best-of-the-rest , three discs of previously unissued songs and concert performances that he originally deemed unworthy of release or , in the case of some songs , left for other artists to cover . Of course , his rejects are the stuff of other rockers ' dreams , which is why Volumes 1-3 is such a harvest . Zealots who have been spinning most of this stuff on bootleg disc for years have complained that the box does n't go far enough in either cleaning out Dylan 's tape closet or documenting the tangential journeys of his muse . But even they have swooned over the unveiling of such treasures as the acoustic demo of Subterranean Homesick Blues ' and a 1965 recording of Farewell , Angelina , ' both heretofore unknown even to bootleggers .

Apocalypse 91 is Chuck D talking black on black , exhorting his community to throw off the chains of ignorance and self-destruction .

In Nighttrain , ' he takes on soft-core brethren riding the overground railroad to Establishment comfort ( Hard to avoid he look wit ' it but he null ' n ' void ' ' ) . The soundtrack is equal to the argument - a stun-gun volley of grinding iron-horse rhythms , squealing sirens and chilling sound bites ( They 're animals anyway , let them lose their souls ' ' ) .

Willie Nelson Sony Music Special Products <p> <p> DO N'T LET THAT BIG BLACK COWBOY hat fool you . Garth Brooks is the Vanilla Ice of country music , a million seller with a Kmart take on C &W; tradition . You can hear that loud and clear in his aptly titled , AOR-with-steel-guitar cover of Billy Joel 's Shameless . ' The rest of Ropin ' the Wind is just high-gloss truck-stop MOR by numbers , bereft of either confessional wit or honky-tonk kick and distinguished only by the annoying hillbilly vocal hiccup that Brooks tries to pass off as a mark of authenticity . Just how little Brooks knows about lyric drama and musical context in country songwriting is woefully apparent in Papa Loved Mama , ' a crass hoedown raveup about a truck driver who loves his errant spouse so much that he rams his rig into the motel room where she 's doin ' the wild thing . <p> Willie Nelson knows everything there is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eye or a smile to your face with song - and he 's literally giving it away to Uncle Sam . Who 'll Buy My Memories ? ( subtitled The IRS Tapes ) is a benefit record of sorts , a solo acoustic tour of Nelson 's songbook , with proceeds going to pay off his outstanding debt to the Internal Revenue Service . Produced by Nelson with Dylan 's old studio sidekick Bob Johnston ( Nashville Skyline , New Morning ) , the album is superb cryin ' - time balladry , an intimate session of bad-love-and-trouble songs , simple plaintive picking and the voice , with a couple of sly references to Nelson 's tax nightmare in titles like What Can You Do to Me Now ' and Wake Me When It 's Over . ' Maybe Garth Brooks should buy a few hundred copies ; it 'd be a nice gesture , and he could learn a little something about the art of country music . <p> Photo : Album cover : Ropin ' the Wind - Garth Brooks <p> <p> OUT OF TIME R.E.M .

But Out of Time is about another fight - heart-to-heart combat - and we find Stipe in a rare explicit mood , getting frank about love , obsession and the inner calm that , when you find it , makes all the pain worthwhile . There is melancholy in the air : in the doleful strings and teardrop mandolin of Losing My Religion ' and in the bittersweet sob of the pedal steel guitar on Country Feedback . ' Yet ultimately Out of Time is a hopeful , if not celebratory , record . You can hear the sun poking through the cloud cover in Near Wild Heaven , ' a delightful three-minute miracle of Sixties Brit-pop zest and Pet Sounds majesty . And for all of Stipe 's lamenting for what he 's lost or aching for what still might be , R.E.M . never surrenders to despondency .

It captures in splatter-fuzz Technicolor the clash of emotions set in motion by Bush 's feel-good Mideast vacation . Young and Crazy Horse hit the road just as Bush set out to liberate the Kuwaiti oil fields , and Young 's own mixed feelings about war , honor , imperialism and the mounting casualties in America 's own back alleys were vividly and angrily summed up in his set list : Cortez the Killer , ' Powderfinger , ' Crime in the City , ' Rockin ' in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wind ' expanded into a stunning feedback-guitar chorale echoing Hendrix 's epochal Star-Spangled Banner .

In Horny Lil ' Devil ' and Black Korea , ' Ice Cube snickers at white bitches ' because they have no butt and no chest , ' threatens to beat up a Japanese store owner and calls for a nationwide boycott of Korean markets - at least the ones that he has n't already burned to the ground . In the closing invective , No Vaseline , ' he rages that his estranged rap mates in N.W.A let a Jew break up my crew , ' a reference to the group 's manager . And this is all in addition to his usual relentless sexism , which strongly suggests that black women have no share in Ice Cube 's ideal of ghetto pride . If there is an agenda for social revolution in Death Certificate , it 's hard to hear it amid the bigotry .

Predictable in all the right ways , Back From Rio showcases McGuinn 's trademark Dylan-as-choirboy twang and chiming Rickenbacker guitar sound via new songs that , while hardly eclipsing the Byrds ' greatest hits , nevertheless crackle like sweet Sixties nuggets . The casual fan will have no trouble catching the distinct echo of McGuinn 's famous Eight Miles High ' solo in the stuttering guitar break of Car Phone , ' but even Byrds obsessives may have to listen twice to distinguish McGuinn 's voice from that of avowed disciple Tom Petty in their sterling mirror-image duet King of the Hill .

A rather vapid lyric reduction of the sorrow and tragedy of homelessness , Crystal Waters 's dance-floor smash Gypsy Woman ( She 's Homeless ) ' was nevertheless a rare bright spot of originality and blessed simplicity amid a ' 91-long plague of Identikit house records and overwrought remixes . Alas , Waters and her production team , the Basement Boys , hammer the Gypsy Woman ' formula into the ground on Surprise , an album made up largely of not-so-subtle variations on the original , with the exception of an ill-advised , clunky jazz detour , Twisted , ' which highlights Waters 's limited vocal technique and range of expression . Still , for those fab few minutes of Gypsy Woman ' ( especially the extended Strip to the Bone ' mix ) , Waters reigned as this year 's Donna Summer . <p> Photo : Album cover : Surprise - Crystal Waters <p> <p> NEW JACK CITY Soundtrack Giant <p> <p> BOYZ N THE HOOD Soundtrack Qwest/Warner Bros . <p> <p> REAL URBAN-COWBOY MUSIC FROM real urban-cowboy movies .

Toni ! Tone ! ' s make-out special Me and You ' and some funky film Muzak contributed by Quincy Jones and Stanley Clarke , Boyz n the Hood is hard-core rap all the way ( and , appropriately , dedicated to the late KDAY Radio , the onetime Voice of Hip-Hop in L.A. ) .

No kidding . <p> Photo : Album cover : New Jack City - Soundtrack <p> <p> BLUE BLVD Dave Alvin Hightone <p> <p> THE SUN NEVER SHINES ON THIS EX-BLASTER 'S street of broken dreams and dead-end schemes . A onetime rock &; roll great dies in cruel ignominy in Haley 's Comet , ' a two-bit punk robs stores and whores around without apology in Guilty Man , ' and young lovers say and do the wrong things over and over again .

Heralded in prerelease hype as a return to chartbusting Purple Rain form , Diamonds and Pearls - featuring Prince 's new stage and studio band , the New Power Generation - proves to be a modest , disappointing drizzle of conventional pop-funk songcraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Prince has never stooped to sounding ordinary - until now . Walk Do n't Walk ' and Daddy Pop ' are no more than cheery fluff , good hooks in search of a finished song ; Strollin ' ' is a twee rewrite of the Young Rascals ' Groovin ' . ' The biggest fumble is his attempt to go hip-hop ; the rap tracks , like the dance-craze number Jughead , ' sound stiff and unconvincing . There are redemptive moments - the sumptuous ballad Insatiable , ' the hits Gett Off ' ( Dirty Mind goes house ) and Cream ' ( Kiss ' with a garagey Funkadelic kick ) - but not enough to warrant the comeback ' plaudits Prince so brazenly courted .

And Justice for All ) or Whiplash ' ( Kill ' Em All ) . But the textural depth and startling clarity of Metallica , combined with the band 's inspired telescoping of melodic and rhythmic ideas into single , concentrated knockout riffs , are a heavy-metal revelation . Having gone where no other thrash band had gone before with Justice 's jaw-dropping slalom runs of searing guitar licks and time-signature change-ups , Metallica balls up its fists and goes for the knuckle-sandwich effect with the brute martial cadence of Enter Sandman , ' the primal Black Sabbath stomping of Sad but True ' and the runaway-stagecoach gallop of Wherever I May Roam . ' James Hetfield 's unabashedly romantic ballad Nothing Else Matters ' is certainly the quietest entry in the Metallica repertoire , yet there is nothing sissified in his bold declaration of vulnerability and need . In fact , the band stumbles only once on Metallica , with Do n't Tread on Me , ' a fuzzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hetfield 's protests that it was not inspired by or written about the gulf war , could not have been released at a more inopportune time . <p> Photo : Album cover : Metallica <p> <p> BLOODSUGARSEXMAGIK Red Hot Chili Peppers Warner Bros . <p> <p> HERE 'S A VERY GOOD ARGUMENT for enforced brevity in the CD age . The artificially high price of compact discs is a major rip-off . That 's hardly news . But too many artists , under the guise of value for money , are spinning out single album-length ideas into double album-length CDs , leaving the consumer with forty minutes ( maybe ) of rockin ' and thirty minutes ( at least ) of ho-hum that in vinyl days would have been left to gather dust on the outtakes and B-sides shelves . At $15.99 a pop , that 's no bargain , either . On BloodSugar , their first album in many moons , the Chili Peppers overdo it by at least a third , and even the good stuff , like Give It Away ' and The Power of Equality , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rick Rubin 's flat , skeletal production favors ham-fisted basics over spatial textures . That means many of these seventeen tracks come off more like demo sketches than finished pieces .

Clapton exhumes that band 's greatest hits with surprisingly enthusiastic soloing , but his backing group sounds as stiff as an ironing board . Frankly , Clapton should have put out just a double-CD set of the special blues nights he hosted at the Albert Hall . The four extended blues blasts on 24 Nights feature Clapton swapping hot licks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners Buddy Guy , Robert Cray and Jimmie Vaughan . There 's a nice blues feeling as well to the lengthy version of Old Love , ' the highlight of the solo album ' section on the second disc , and even the lovably mushy Wonderful Tonight ' is buoyed by some fine guitar work .

The legitimate Western release of McCartney 's Russian album of Fifties covers came a bit late for the poor saps who paid elephant bucks for the Melodia-label original back in ' 88 , but it was otherwise worth the wait . The unlikely product of the 1987 pub jam ' tryouts for his current studio and road band , Snova v CCCP ( which translates as Back in the U.S.S.R. ) is McCartney 's Pin-Ups , a jukebox jamboree of roots-rock classics - Kansas City , ' Lucille , ' Eddie Cochran 's Twenty Flight Rock , ' Bo Diddley 's Crackin ' Up , ' among others - that he , John Lennon and George Harrison cut their molars on in their pre-Fabdom combos , the Quarrymen and the Silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finest , least-mannered vocals in years , these fourteen tracks were cut in just two days and sound all the better for it . <p> Unplugged , taken from McCartney 's acoustic appearance on MTV 's weekly hootenanny hour , is more wine-and-cheese than pint-o ' - bitters . The sound and set list overemphasize fireside gentility , with lite-rock treatments of Good Rockin ' Tonight ' and Be-Bop-A-Lula ' mixed in with old Beatles ballads , Bill Monroe 's Blue Moon of Kentucky ' and Jesse Fuller 's San Francisco Bay Blues .

THE debut album by Mr. Bungle - an art-mosh sextet from San Francisco featuring Faith No More singer Mike Patton ( under the nom de snarl Vlad Drac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that , you get barely a nanosecond 's breathing space . Egged on by producer John Zorn , a jump-cut specialist in his own right , the Bungles maniacally wham together as many disparate , and deviantly altered , styles of music as possible in a seventy-three-minute span . Which means that you get a frantic , sometimes incoherent but never dull Burroughsian cutup smorgasbord of zoomcore punk , industrial stomp , avant-reggae , double-time circus jazz and acid-fried heavy metal . Often in the same song . These guys did n't come to play . As Patton points out at the end of Squeeze Me Macaroni , ' We came to pottie . ' <p> The main difference between Mr. Bungle and Torture Garden , by Zorn 's thrashman 's holiday band Naked City , is that Zorn and crew ( guitarist Bill Frisell , keysman Wayne Horvitz , bassist Fred Frith , drummer Joey Baron , Japanese howler Yamasutka Eye ) actually break up their material into genre-specific songs . So you get a 45-rpm EP with forty-two ( ! ) songs on it , most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Mr. Bungle , is frantic , sometimes incoherent , never dull . It is also guaranteed to clear the room at parties , unless your guests ' tastes run to Napalm Death , the Stooges ' Fun House ( spinning at the speed of sound ) and post-Ascension Coltrane ( ditto ) . In that case , you might want to try playing Torture Garden at 33 1/3 . It 's just as hard , just as heavy , but the pleasure lingers a little longer . <p> Photo : Album cover : Mr. Bungle <p> <p> WARM YOUR HEART Aaron Neville A &M; <p> <p> LINDA RONSTADT 'S HEART HAS ALWAYS been in the right place when it comes to making Mr. Tell It Like It Is ' a household name . But as the coproducer of Neville 's first-ever major-label solo album , her ears are stuck in Mellowville . What might have been the R &B; vocal record of the year is , under her auspices , a mixed bag of elegant soul sensations and VH-1 kitsch . Even the considerable charms of Neville 's butterfly tenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOR hokum like the rinky-dink reggae cover of the Main Ingredient 's Everybody Plays the Fool ' or Close Your Eyes , ' his smoochy duet with La Ronstadt . Those same charms and skills have everything to do , however , with the transcendent warmth and grace of Randy Newman 's Louisiana 1927 , ' John Hiatt 's It Feels Like Rain ' and , believe it or not , Ave Maria , ' in which Neville plays the operatic R &B; tenor of your dreams . <p> Photo : Album cover : Warm Your Heart - Aaron Neville <p> <p> THE SOUL CAGES Sting A &M; <p> <p> OF STING 'S SOLO RECORDS , THIS ONE is the easiest to appreciate for its rich art-pop surface and the hardest to love for its thematic premise . The Soul Cages is basically Sting waxing literate for an hour on the Big Nothing , wrapped up in grief and guilt over the death of his father . Even for a man who has freely danced on the precipice of pretension for years , it sounds like an insufferable conceit . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and mourns his loss with a tortured but elegant vocal grace that contrasts effectively with the velvety textures and sly intricacies of the extended arrangements . The songs , of course , are nearly all about reaching the end - of life , of love , of your rope . The exceptions are about getting away , like Island of Souls ' ' : That night , he dreamed of the ship in the world/It would carry his father and he/To a place they could never be found . ' Yet a million or so people cared enough to buy , and listen to , The Soul Cages .

' Which neatly sums up the amount of deep thought the group put into Schubert Dip . EMF reportedly stands for Ecstasy Motherfuckers , but there 's little ecstasy to be had in this group 's fucking around . EMF recycles the same pounding keyboard motifs and staccato beats , and singer James Atkin has a hokey , breathless , monotonic delivery that can be charitably described as sub-Pet Shop Boys .

No band , here or abroad , better captures the epic college-radio sound of post-adolescent lethargy and emotional insecurity than Dinosaur Jr , the main reason being that most of singer-guitarist J. Mascis 's copious imitators lack his droll wit and pop heart . Even when he 's laying the fuzz tone on ten bricks thick , Mascis snares you on pearly hooks like the shaky falsetto chorus of The Wagon ' and the aching rattle-and-jangle of Blowing It . ' With his drowsy vocal style and intuitive grasp of folk-pop songcraft , Mascis sounds like an errant , manic-depressive twin brother of Paul Westerberg . But for a guy who sings like he spends most of his waking hours staring at his navel , Mascis plays guitar like he 's scraping the lint out with a garden hoe .

Titles like So You Think You 're in Love ' and Ultra Unbelievable Love ' may lead you to suspect Hitchcock 's gone all gooey on the subject . In fact , the former - a surprise MTV hit , no less - is about emotional cowardice , about not having the gonads to trust your heart or your better instincts - and not just in romance , either ( The silent majority is the crime of the century . . . .

The result may lack the immediacy of their long-revered dB 's records , but it is top-drawer folk pop that rewards patient attention . Holsapple and Stamey deftly reconcile their contrasting styles of heart massage with a pastel blend of back-porch harmonizing , feathery arrangements and subtle brush strokes of Sixties psychedelia . Fittingly , Mavericks ' sole cover is a haunting rendition of the late Gene Clark 's folk-rock jewel Here Without You , ' which mirrors Holsapple and Stamey 's own wondrous ways with melodic nuance , vocal grace and the language of troubled love . <p> Marshall Crenshaw 's Life 's Too Short - produced with cranked-guitar crispness by Ed Stasium - is simply too good to be buried next to his ( undeserved ) nonhits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in fine , familiar form , evoking the Great Ghosts of Pure Pop Past with come-hither hooks and boyish vocal nods to John Lennon and Buddy Holly .

But After Awhile is Gilmore 's first major-label release , and he 's made the most of the opportunity , dusting off a few old gems , as well as trotting out more recent copyrights . As such , the album is n't so much a statement of arrival as a resume for overdue recognition , going as far back as his lonesome barhopper 's blues Tonight I Think I 'm Gon na Go Downtown , ' from the Flatlanders ' star-crossed 1972 LP , and Treat Me Like a Saturday Night , ' a plaintive beauty first recorded by Joe Ely on his fine 1977 debut album . Gilmore 's tremulous , nasally twang - which suggests a West Texas honky-tonk Dylan - may be an acquired taste for the Randy Travis crowd , but it has a heart-tugging quality all its own , and it perfectly suits his **25;742;TOOLONG meditations on longing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awhile - Jimmie Dale Gilmore <p> <p> STORYVILLE Robbie Robertson Geffen <p> <p> THE LIGHTS ARE MORE NEON RED than gaslight yellow in Robbie Robertson 's Storyville . For all of its proud Crescent City musical trappings and the local celebrities who chip in ( the Neville Brothers , the Rebirth Brass Band , the Meters ) , Storyville is n't so much a valentine to the mythic legend and licentious reputation of New Orleans ' fabled cathouse district of the same name as a meditation on the streets , bars and beds in every town where people still go looking for succor and sanctuary . While there are hints of Robertson 's American Gothic storytelling touch , he concentrates here on poignant sketches of fleeting romances , missed connections and the occasional happy-ever-after score , rendering these mini-odysseys of love and salvation with pastel keyboard broad strokes , subtle but lustrous brass arrangements and marvelous vocal contributions from Aaron Neville and gospel greats the Zion Harmonizers . Granted , Robertson 's voice is an acquired taste - a raspy whisper that always seems to be straining for a scream - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upfront in the mix . Yet Storyville is a quietly absorbing record that slowly but assuredly reveals its dusky beauty .

Viva Dead Ponies ricochets from warped Steely Dan-ish pop ( The Door-to-Door Inspector ' ' ) and sardonic disco ( Thursday ' ' ) to full-bore punk ( Chemical Cosh ' ' ) to swelling cathedral majesty ( Viva Dead Ponies ' ' ) .

It is not really the blues of lost Delta legends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk in that timeless style . Rather , this is revisionist primitivism a la Ry Cooder , grit-caked evocations of mythic Americana rendered with a punkier Robbie Robertson touch , a combination of stark acoustic musing and dramatic , often unexpected bursts of electric mayhem , like the feedback climax of Long Way Around .

Fortunately , the end of the Go-Betweens has meant the beginning of two promising , if divergent , solo careers . Watershed finds McLennan on a tour of sexual crossroads , sifting through the remains of shattered love affairs and hopeless romantic obsessions with the wry confessional wit and savory understated rootsbeat sound of fellow Aussie troubadour Paul Kelly . McLennan is in no hurry to work his magic ; the subtle hooks and melancholic allure of songs like " Have n't I Been a Fool " and " Haunted House " take a little time to connect .

New York Eye and Ear Control ( Matador , CD ) is not a reissue of the legendary mid-Sixties ESP-Disk release by avant-jazz visionary Albert Ayler . It does in its own way , though , aspire to similar extremes in sound - in this case , the guitar-driven No Wave howl dubbed skronk by the late Lester Bangs . Contributors include prolific free-music trio Borbetomagus , ex-Red Transistor guitar mangler Rudolph Grey ( joined by Sonic Youth 's Thurston Moore ) , Pussy Galore offshoot Royal Trux and double-bass demon Cop Shoot Cop .

Although the major record labels continue to resist the demands of consumers and retailers for lower CD prices , the rising cost of cassettes continues to tilt the picture in favor of CDs . The latest figures from the Recording Industry Association of America show CD-album sales for the first half of 1991 to be almost twenty-five percent higher than the same period a year ago , with cassette sales dropping seventeen percent . And for the first time since the compact disc 's introduction in the early Eighties , the dollar amount spent on CDs surpassed that of cassettes during the first half of 1991 . <p> The sales of CD singles rose dramatically over the same period , with the number of units shipped soaring by almost 1900 percent , compared with the falling off of cassette singles by 26 percent . Still , over 33 million cassette singles were shipped in the first six months of this year , compared with only 2 million CD singles , so the CD-5 still has quite a way to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The handling of Miles Davis 's catalog on CD has come under intense scrutiny in the wake of Davis 's death , in September . Columbia Records , specifically , has some major problems to rectify on some of the jazz trumpeter 's most famous works . Most of the problem CDs are victims of the early days of the format , when quality control was not as closely enforced as it is today . Nonetheless , many of the dog discs have remained uncorrected for years . The CD for Davis 's landmark Kind of Blue album suffers from a lack of high frequencies , which were removed when the CD was mastered in order to rid the disc of tape hiss . Unfortunately , subtle effects such as ride-cymbal strokes were lost in the process . The CD for Davis 's renowned album Miles Ahead is even more egregious : The disc features all alternate versions , not the familiar takes from the original album that helped make Davis a household name back in the late Fifties . Apparently , the masters for Miles Ahead could not be located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the producers pulled alternate parts and mastered the CD - without any caveat for the consumer . I 'm very unhappy about those , ' says Mike Berniker , an independent producer who works out of Sony Music 's jazz department . In deference to Miles , I 'm going to see to it that they are redone . ' . . . A tribute album of various artists ' performing Richard Thompson songs is being planned by Capitol . One track , R.E.M . ' s version of Wall of Death , ' is already in the can . We 're presently in negotiation with Pete Townshend , Chrissie Hynde , Bonnie Raitt and Elvis Costello , ' says project producer John Chelew . . . . The second batch of Apple Records reissues is due from Capitol in the spring , consisting of No Dice , by Badfinger , Maybe Tomorrow , by the Iveys ( an early version of Badfinger ) , Doris Troy 's Doris Troy ( with guest appearances by George Harrison , Eric Clapton and Billy Preston ) , Mary Hopkin 's Earth Song and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-CD Talking Heads anthology , Sand in the Vaseline : Popular Favorites 1976-1991 , and Lou Reed 's three-CD box set , Between Thought and Expression , have both been rescheduled for early next year . . . .

Set for CD reissue are the group 's third album , Sister Lovers , correctly sequenced for the first time and including two unreleased tracks ; Big Star Live , taken from a mid-Seventies radio broadcast ; and Big Star member Chris Bell 's solo album I Am the Cosmos , which Rykodisc 's Jeff Rougvie calls the gem of the group ; Chris was just as important to the group as Alex was .

Box 3043 , Santa Monica , CA 90408 . <p> SEASON OF BOXED SETS <p> AS THE SNOWBALLING OF box sets reaches avalanche proportions , the ultimate considerations are which artists deserve the scope and scale of such treatment and which boxes give those deserving artists their due . For forty bucks or more , listeners have a right to expect revelation in both material and quality of sound , as well as narrative momentum that makes fresh sense of an artist 's musical development . This season 's offerings run the gamut from Jimi Hendrix to the Monkees , from the Carpenters to the Clash . <p> <p> * * * * * The Birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the most significant and long awaited of the year 's CD reissues . Though the sound quality is occasionally spotty by contemporary standards , these three discs show the development of Charles into an artist of unparalleled accomplishment . While transferring the form and fervor of gospel music to the secular arena , Charles drew from an array of sources to cut his own musical path . He would later enjoy greater popular success , but these Fifties recordings for Atlantic celebrate the artist at his creative peak . <p> <p> * * * The Essential King Crimson : Frame by Frame ( EG/Caroline ) , King Crimson : The self-importance of Crimson 's early incarnations renders much of Frame by Frame a period piece , though the experiments in tempo and texture paid greater dividends in the band 's Eighties regrouping . The four discs trace the development of the various Crimsons , risking stretches of tedium for moments of transcendence , while the detailed booklet shows the self-deprecating wit of Robert Fripp that surfaces too rarely in the music . <p> <p> * * * 1/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the illustrious trio of Yardbirds guitar alumni , Beck boasts enough instrumental bravura to charge inconsistent material and inferior supporting casts with greatness . For all his bluesiness , he has never suffered from purism , forging a style that is perhaps second only to Hendrix 's for live-wire dazzle . Beckology shows that Beck was a true original back in his pre-Yardbird days with the Tridents and that he was more responsible for the success of the Yardbirds than either Eric Clapton or Jimmy Page . <p> <p> * * * 1/2 Clash on Broadway ( Epic/Legacy ) , the Clash : The band that railed against turning rebellion into money ' now finds itself repackaged as pricey punk nostalgia . Amid the smattering of demos , live tracks , B sides and outtakes , the core of this three-disc set serves as a reminder that the power and ambition of the Clash went well beyond the time-capsule limitations of punk , with a go-for-the-throat urgency that rock has lost in the years since . <p> <p> * * * Pandora 's Box ( Columbia ) , Aerosmith : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands can become rock institutions if they hang around long enough . For Aerosmith die-hards , almost half of the fifty-two tracks are previously unreleased . The music additionally documents the disintegration of the band in the early Eighties , before a regrouped Aerosmith cleaned up its act . <p> <p> * * * * They Call Me the Fat Man . . . ' The Legendary Imperial Recordings ( EMI ) , Antoine Fats ' Domino : For New Orleans piano wizardry , Fats is n't the alchemist that Professor Longhair or James Booker was , but these four discs show how sheer likability translated into sales of almost 70 million records . Credit bandleader Dave Bartholomew and a crack horn section for keeping the hit machine stoked , and credit Domino himself for the ebullience of these rollicking grooves . Though a hundred cuts might be too much Fats for all but the most ardent fan , the set follows his progression from well before the rock &; roll revolution through the early volleys of the British Invasion . <p> <p> * * Stages ( Reprise ) , Jimi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolific musical corpse this side of Elvis , Stages falls considerably short of its promise . Though it purports to detail Hendrix 's onstage development by including a concert from each of the four years from 1967 through 1970 , much of the repetition of material is simply redundant , and the sound quality of the first two concerts is barely passable . Hendrix was the Charlie Parker of rock guitar , but a set such as this gives little indication of how much he grew as a composer or how much his musical adventurousness outpaced his accompanists . Disappointments such as this set and last year 's Lifelines serve to delay the release of the inclusive box that Hendrix deserves . <p> <p> * * * * The Complete Prestige/Bluesville Recordings ( Prestige/Bluesville ) , Lightnin ' Hopkins : Perhaps the most vital of the country bluesmen to reach a wider audience in the Sixties , Sam Lightnin ' ' Hopkins was in fine form during his four-year stint with Bluesville/Prestige . While the best of this music is solo and acoustic , the set shows evidence of Hopkins as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jolt . These seven discs might seem exhaustive , but they actually represent only a small slice of Hopkins 's recorded output and stylistic range . <p> <p> * * * * Howlin ' Wolf ( Chess/MCA ) , Howlin ' Wolf : MCA 's exemplary Chess Box series does well by the Wolf , whose raw power resists imitation . This set also serves as the Hubert Sumlin box , a tribute to the under-celebrated guitarist whose jagged edge was as crucial to the music as Wolf 's howl . <p> <p> * * * * 1/2 The Patsy Cline Collection ( MCA ) , Patsy Cline : <p> Impeccably produced by the Country Music Foundation and packaged by MCA , this four-disc box offers a mother lode of revelations for those who know Cline only through such hits as Crazy ' and I Fall to Pieces ' or as a major influence on the likes of Linda Ronstadt and K.D. Lang . From uptempo fare to sophisticated balladry , Cline became increasingly polished without sacrificing any of her vocal purity or country conviction . The sound quality throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost a tenth of the more than 100 cuts previously unreleased . <p> <p> * * * 1/2 Lynyrd Skynyrd ( MCA ) , Lynyrd Skynyrd : The early , previously unreleased material that dominates the first of these three discs sheds new light on Skynyrd , emphasizing a soulful Southern song band . The original demo rescues Free Bird ' from overkill , while sessions in Muscle Shoals produced music that was frequently stronger than what the band chose to release . <p> <p> * * * Listen to the Band ( Rhino ) , the Monkees : Hey , hey , it 's four discs of more Monkees than you 'll ever need to hear . The sound quality is first-rate , but it 's ironic to see the ultimate prefab throwaway memorialized for posterity . <p> <p> * 1/2 The Essential Collection ( Relativity ) , T. Rex : The transformation of Marc Bolan from acoustic mystic into pop flash could have inspired a great box , but this three-disc set is n't it . The Essential Collection does n't include the transitional Ride a White Swan ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . ' Instead , it begins at the crest of T. Rex 's popularity in ' 72 and heads downhill . Informative essays ca n't compensate for the skimpiness of the discs themselves . <p> <p> Out of the Box : Among other of the season 's box-set giftables : Barbra Streisand 's Just for the Record . . . , for those who think Babs is as special as she does ; the Carpenters ' From the Top , in which Richard explains that his astute song selection was the reason for the duo 's success ; Chicago 's Group Portrait , from the band that was releasing box sets way back when ; and the Modern Jazz Quartet 's MJQ40 , subtle and exquisite . . . .
