It probably looked like a neatly packaged , over-the-counter cure for a financial headache . In need of cash for new public health campaigns on smoking and violence , the American Medical Association decided to turn to the Sunbeam Corp . While best known for its food mixers , blenders and toasters , the Delray Beach , Fla. , company also makes medical equipment  --  thermometers , heating pads and blood-pressure monitors . Under an arrangement that could conceivably net the association millions of dollars a year in royalties , last week it gave Sunbeam exclusive rights to fix the A.M.A. seal on some of the firm 's health-care products  --  and promptly set off a feverish debate . <P> " An appalling decision , " huffed a New York Times editorial , saying the deal " casts suspicion on the A.M.A. 's credibility . " Many physicians , including A.M.A. members , also weighed in with harsh diagnoses . " What stands out here is the stupidity , even more than the venality , " snapped Dr. Quentin Young , head of an advocacy organization called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The A.M.A. is cashing in its debilitated reputation as a guardian of American health and becoming straightforward feather merchants . " <P> The flap comes at a time when the A.M.A. least needs it . Once it commanded virtually unchallenged respect . Today its power , despite a membership of 300,000 , is greatly diminished from its heyday in the 1960s , when it had enough clout on Capitol Hill to dictate substantial changes in Medicare laws . Older physicians in particular are dismayed that it has been unable to slow down the managed-care revolution that has deprived them of income and decision-making power over patients . Many younger physicians find the organization simply irrelevant . <P> Perhaps indicative of how out of touch the A.M.A. is was its surprised reaction to the furor that the Sunbeam deal provoked . " People are too willing to think something sinister is going on here , " complains Larry Jellen , the A.M.A. 's vice president of marketing . " Our intentions are exceptionally honorable . " Maybe so , but the A.M.A. might have found it instructive to do a case history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **26;5635;TOOLONG program out of liability concerns . <P> Then there is the more recent experience of the American Heart Association . Seven years ago , it launched an ambitious nutritional-labeling program that would have netted as much as $600,000 per endorsement of commercial products , depending on market share . Like the A.M.A. , the heart association had a public-spirited goal : it wanted the labeling to help consumers understand the nutritional content of the foods they bought . But the Food and Drug Administration objected , and the A.H.A . eventually dropped the program  --  though a few years later the FDA itself started requiring more explicit food labels . ( The A.H.A . has since instituted a more modest " food certification " program. )
