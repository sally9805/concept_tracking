MICHAEL LEAVITT GOVERNOR OF UTAH <P> Part of the reason his approval ratings exceed 80% is that Leavitt fits the evolving profile of Utah 's citizenry , a conservative group joined lately by cyberhungry and outdoors-loving transplants from the West Coast . He 's hip to online projects like the Western-based " virtual university , " and he has defended the environment more forcefully than the Republican-controlled state legislature . Still , Leavitt is no Al Gore : he supports the state 's strict antiabortion law and the recent ban on after-school clubs , imposed to deter gay-student alliances . If Dole wins , look for Leavitt to be offered a Cabinet post , possibly at Interior . <P> STEVE GOLDSMITH MAYOR OF INDIANAPOLIS <P> Goldsmith has never made any secret of his big political ambitions .

He has drawn national attention as an advocate of privatizing city services . <P> DAN LUNGREN CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL <P> His brash style has endeared him to the Newt Gingrich wing of the party .

It needs a fire hose , " said Brownback , 39 , after discovering that Congress had its own beautician . The lawyer and former farm broadcaster has taken a scouring approach to politics , both in the House as a freshman and in Kansas , where he scored a primary win over moderate Sheila Frahm , the anointed heiress to Bob Dole 's seat . As for November , well , Kansas has n't had a Democratic Senator since 1932 . <P> KENNETH BLACKWELL OHIO TREASURER <P> The great mentioner included this former Cincinnati mayor on the second tier of rumored Veep picks . The first African American to hold statewide executive office in Ohio , Blackwell has a resume that includes stints as city councilman , an ambassador to the U.N. , and Deputy Housing Secretary under Jack Kemp . The son of a meat packer and a practical nurse , Blackwell was a Democrat growing up but switched parties in the 1980s . His conversion was driven in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " distrust of bureaucracies .
