Polar alignment gets a bad rap from beginners in astronomy . No one likes to think about it , let alone do it . But in fact it is a simple task that makes observing or photography under the stars far more enjoyable . As you look at a star , it moves across the sky from east to west in a giant curve . Any equatorial mounting can compensate easily for this movement , but for your telescope to follow a star in a smooth , continuous motion , you need to align its mounting with the celestial pole . Luckily , polar alignment does n't have to be any better than your needs demand . It 's really a process of relining an initial approximation until the errors become too small to matter . Most equatorial mountings are fitted with slow-motion controls in right ascension and declination that allow you to make small adjustments to the telescope 's aim . Some beginners wonder why they ca n't simply twiddle these controls to keep an object centered . For a short spell of casual observing at low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or high-power viewing awkward . But if you were taking photos , you would find that an unaligned mounting makes the field of view rotate slowly around whatever object you guide on . Stars would become curving lines instead or pinpoints , and if you wanted to use setting circles to locate an object , you 'd find that the object was n't where the circles say it should be . Since polar aligning does n't take long to do , it 's best to get in the habit of doing it right . Two types of equatorial mounts are common , the fork mount usually supplied with Schmidt-Cassegrains and the German equatorial found on most other telescopes . The two types differ slightly in how you align them , mainly because the German equatorial does not allow the telescope to be pointed as easily straight at the pole . FIRST THINGS FIRST The first thing to do with any equatorial mount is to check that the polar axis and declination axis are perpendicular to each other . You can do this anytime . In fact , daytime is preferable because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , turn the telescope until the declination setting circle reads +90deg and clamp the declination axis . The telescope tube should now lie parallel to the polar axis . To check this , loosen the lock on the polar axis elevation and lower it until you can point the scope at a distant object on the horizon . Center the object in the field of view and rotate the tube in right ascension . The object you have aimed at should stay in place in the field of view and rotate around the center or the field . If it does not , the axes are not quite perpendicular and you will see the centered object rotate around some other point in the field of view . To correct this , you may have to give the declination axis a little turn from the 90deg mark and try again . When the object stays put , adjust the declination circle to read 90deg . If you ca n't get the object to remain stationary while turning the tube in right ascension , the telescope tube is not parallel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shim the tube to make it parallel . Also take a moment or two to make sure that your finder is properly aligned . With a distant object in the telescope 's eyepiece , adjust the finder 's locking rings so the object lies dead center in the finder 's crosshairs . The next thing to do is to set the polar axis so it points at the pole . The elevation of the pole above the horizon is equal to the latitude of your observing location . Many equatorials have a scale that provides a coarse latitude setting directly . If your mount has it , use it . I your scope lacks this feature but does have setting circles , swing the tube in declination until the declination circle reads your latitude ( this is the declination of your zenith point ) . Clamp the axis . Now rotate the scope in right ascension until a carpenter 's level shows the declination axis is horizontal . Lock the right ascension axis . Finally , adjust the mounting 's latitude setting until the carpenter 's level shows the tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset . METHOD ONE : SIMPLE POLAR ALIGNMENT With the onset of evening and the return of Polaris to the sky , it 's time to make a rough alignment on the pole . Squat down in front of the scope and aim the polar axis as best you can at Polaris . Eyeballing it like this puts the axis within 5deg or so of the pole , good enough for casual viewing . You can improve the aim by swinging the scope until the declination circle reads 90deg , then turning the whole mounting until you see Polaris in a low power eyepiece . This alignment provides relatively accurate tracking in right ascension with or without a clock drive . METHOD TWO : ALIGNMENT FOR CASUAL PHOTOGRAPHY If you want to do photography through your telescope , even casually , you 're going to need to align your scope more accurately . Here are two ways to get accurate alignment for photography . Each will align the scope to within 1deg of the pole . The fork mount found on most Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes offers a relatively quick and easy method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alignment , this method uses the fact that the optical path of the telescope and the polar axis of the fork mount not only lie parallel but overlap . Point the scope to +90deg , lock the declination axis , and observe through the finderscope . Now turn the whole telescope through right ascension and watch what happens . The image will rotate around the center of the finder 's field of view . You need to turn the mounting left or right until the rotation point seen in the finder coincides with the celestial pole . Although it is called the pole star , Polaris does not mark the exact pole , but rather is offset from it by 47deg . To offset the correct amount in the right direction , align the scope with reference to Polaris and another easily found star , Gamma Cassiopeiae . As you can see from the diagram above , the position of the pole is continually moving ( thanks to precession ) . At present , Polaris lies about 0.8deg ( 47 ' ' ) from the pole , in roughly the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cassiopeia 's W. How far is 47 ' ' ? Determine the field of view of your finderscope . If it has a field of view of 3.5deg this equals 210 ' ' . The distance from the edge of the field to the center of the crosshairs would therefore be 105 ' ' , and half of that distance is slightly more than 52 ' ' . So if you placed Polaris halfway between the center of the crosshair and the edge of the field ( as offset toward Gamma Cassiopeiae ) , the celestial pole would lie close to the center of the crosshair . Check this position against the star field in the diagram above . Remember to make all your adjustments by moving the whole mounting , not the tube alone . With a German Equatorial , you could follow the same process , but polar alignment is a lot more time consuming and difficult because the tripod or pier prevents you from rotating the tube completely freely in right ascension . Because it is awkward to point the scope directly at Polaris , the method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " two-star " method . Once you 've obtained rough alignment using the first method , locate two stars of either the same right ascension or declination , but separated by about 20deg . Try the following pairs with the same right ascension : Lambda Orionis and Theta(1) Orionis ; Iota Cancri and Epsilon Hydrae ; Gamma Delphini and Lambda Cygni ; and Mu Canis Majoris and Epsilon Canis Majoris . Center the first star in the finder or eyepiece and lock both axes . Then loosen the declination axis and swing the scope to the second star . It should move through the crosshairs in the finder or the center of the eyepiece . If it does n't , adjust the mount slightly and try again . A variation of this involves using three stars , widely separated but lying within a degree or so of the celestial equator . Choose a trio of stars from the following group : Zeta Aquarii , Delta Orionis , Gamma Virginis , Lambda Ophiuchi , and Alpha Piscium . In this " three star " method , the telescope moves only in right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three you have selected . Next , move to the second star ; it should move through the center of the eyepiece . Then move to the third star , which should also move through the eyepiece . If the telescope is not properly aligned , one or two of the stars will not move through the field of view . To remedy this , make a very slight adjustment in the azimuth of the telescope mount by turning it and try this procedure again . With a little luck , you should be quite close on the second iteration , close enough or everything but critical photography . As a final check on the accuracy this method , find a bright star and center it in the field of view . Look up the coordinates or this target and check your setting circles . The declination of the target should be within 3deg of the listed declination . The right ascension of the star will have to be set on the right ascension dial . Next find another star and move the scope to that using the circles only . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right ascension and declination , look into the eyepiece , and see it . If it 's not there , it 's back to square one  --  you 're way of somewhere . METHOD THREE : PERFECT POLAR ALIGNMENT When a scope is in perfect polar alignment , visual and photographic work becomes a snap . You can turn on your clock drive and track an object seemingly forever . To align your scope , first make the rough alignment as you did using the first method and refine it by using the second . This final method uses the declination drift of a star near the horizon or meridian to determine how far of the polar axis is and then correct it . If you are working with a refractor or a SCT and using star diagonal , remove the star diagonal . Remember , star diagonals play havoc with directions in the field of view ! After you have made your rough alignment , select a star near the meridian ( due south ) and within 5deg the celestial equator . Center the star in your eyepiece and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reticle eyepiece , align the crosshairs to their proper directions and watch to see if the star moves above or below the east-west crosshair . If you do n't have a reticle eyepiece , place the star near the north or south edge of the field or view so you will be able to see any motion quickly . Pay no attention to the east-west drift of the star . Correct for this motion as needed with your right ascension control to keep the star in the field . What you are looking for is north-south drift because it is entirely due to east-west misalignment of the polar axis . If the star drifts north , the polar axis is too far west . If the star drifts south , the polar axis is too far east . Make your correction by moving the mount in azimuth in the appropriate direction . Then start again , selecting another star near the meridian and equator and then recheck it . Repeat this procedure until you can not detect any north-south drift . Now select a star rising near the eastern horizon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon to escape the turbulence and light pollution if you live in a city as I do . This star should also be no more than 5deg from the celestial equator . Again , place the star in the field so you will be able to see any declination drift . You are again looking or north-south drift , but this time any drift you see will be caused entirely by the north-south misalignment of the polar axis . Now , if the star drifts north , the polar axis is too high and you 'll have to lower it . if the star drifts south , the polar axis is too low . Make the necessary adjustments by adjusting the height of the polar axis and repeat the procedure until you can not detect any north-south drift . This entire procedure takes about an hour but it is well worth the extra effort . After you do a few trial runs at polar alignment , you 'll find it comes quite naturally . You 'll also see that it is a simple procedure that removes the fuss from your observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stars , and enjoy the beauty of the universe with few guiding worries .

THEY SERVE AS A GAUGE OF THE CHANGE THAT IS TAKING PLACE IN OUR SCHOOLS , LIBRARIES , AND WORLD . <p> As such , in 2006 , the ICFL contracted Corona Research , Inc. , of Denver , Colorado , to conduct a statewide survey using focus groups to determine the perceptions digital natives hold of public libraries . The participants were 12-25 years old from all areas of Idaho : urban and rural ; six different geographic areas of Idaho ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Group participants were representative in terms of age , gender , and library usage patterns . <p> Defining multiculturalism in Idaho goes beyond ethnicity , as it also reaches across geographic , economic , and demographic strata . Geographically , the state has deserts , major rivers , forests , and mountains . Economically , areas include agricultural , urban , forest , manufacturing , and energy development . Demographically , Idaho has -- as many other areas do -- a growing population of older citizens , along with growing population of youth who are ethnically diverse . Each of these factors contributes to the cultural vitality of the individual communities and how public libraries are utilized . How has technology influenced multiculturalism in Idaho ? The key findings of the Idaho " Digital Natives " study reflect the following for both public and school libraries : <p> * Digital natives place a high value on learning and education . Teachers play an extremely important role in the digital natives ' learning experience . The participants across all the groups indicated that education and learning were necessary to " progress " in life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information and learning , these factors can be used to adapt web-based resources and other forms of technology to teach not only digital natives , but also others in our communities . Libraries have the ability to thrive in their role . * Learning about opposing viewpoints and having interactions with others are important . It is important to digital natives that they learn about other viewpoints , not only from the Internet , but also from face to face interactions with other individuals . The library provides an optimum vehicle for this to occur . As a public facility , it can provide a venue for various social , informational , and other community activities , where individuals can freely express their viewpoints . * Digital natives are most likely to pay attention to information that is fun and interesting . This finding relates to informational content as well as to the way information is presented . Digital natives expressed preference for learning interesting tidbits , along with current events . This provides local libraries the opportunity to be the primary repository for community information , current events , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with school libraries to focus on the literacy efforts through Summer Reading and Family Reading week , the challenge is to continue these fun activities beyond the elementary school level , to include tweens , teens , young adults , and older adults . * While the Internet is typically the starting point for digital natives when a search for information is begun , the information found on the Internet is not always trustworthy . Yet , convenience is most important when digital natives look for information . It was felt , overall , by the participants that information obtained through books and libraries is much more trustworthy . This opens the door for libraries to provide a library-sponsored search engine for their patrons via a 24/7 web site , while offering digital natives the convenience and credibility that they desire when attaining information -- making a web presence vital for any library . * The purpose of a library 's physical location is shifting from one of providing tools for research to that of entertainment . While digital natives generally perceive libraries as places for serious work , quiet , and books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and older adults . Digital natives are hungry for a place to socialize . With its centralized locations , the public library makes a great place for this to happen . Libraries can change how they are perceived by changing their appearance and becoming more involved with the community . Libraries must get the community involved when designing programs and events . Librarians will need to offer a wide range of services to keep current users coming and to bring in non-users . The participants suggested that the state divide libraries into sections for different types of activities : research , social interaction , computers , reading , and so on . Also important is the aspect that libraries need to market their activities so communities will know about the programs they offer . It is apparent libraries are quickly changing from a storehouse of physical objects to a community center which is vital for culturalization and connecting with others both within and outside of the community . The changes we are seeing in Idaho include the establishing of areas for socialization-which may include coffee shops-teen spaces and young adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested as well as attract non-users , making the library a community information center , and enhancing literacy programs for youth and adults in collaboration with a diverse list of community partners . <p> L : WHAT IT ALL MEANS The effect these findings and the subsequent library service development has had on multiculturalism in Idaho has been significant . Communities are coming together across cultural boundaries to meet in the library . Non-English speaking individuals are learning to navigate cultural boundaries through the public and school libraries . Adults are using library services to further their economic status through job search development skills . Young adults are finding library services that meet their socialization needs , and children continue to foster the love of reading through literacy programs from birth . <p> Finally , library programming in Idaho is reaching across age boundaries by creating a multitude of collaborative intergenerational activities ( http : **28;14066;TOOLONG ) , youth internship programs ( http : **36;14096;TOOLONG ) , and literacy programs ( http : **87;14134;TOOLONG ) , which incorporate schools , families , and communities . <p> To see this transformation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerome Public Library , http : //jerome.lili.org , web sites . They all incorporate technology in various ways , such as navigating the Internet , discerning reliable information , and building community both online and face-to-face . <p> As technology brings people closer together within communities , the world becomes smaller . As the world becomes more connected , libraries assume a greater role in the socialization of communities . The key findings of this study will continue to be a road map for library service development throughout the state . <p> L : FURTHER READING Idaho Commission for Libraries ( prepared by Corona Research , Inc. ) .
