THE NASTY GIRL Directed and Written by Michael Verhoeven <P> German films are n't funny . German films lack charm . German films avoid the Nazi past like the plague it was . <P> Be prepared to junk preconceptions with The Nasty Girl , Michael Verhoeven 's exhilarating true-life adventure about a Nazi hunter in modern Bavaria . <P> A decade ago , Anja Rosmus was just another bright 20-year-old student in the town of Passau , where Hitler had lived and Eichmann was married . Anja was a good Catholic with no political ax to lodge in the town 's guilty past . Then she decided to write an essay about Passau 's resistance to the Nazis  --  and was surprised to find the gentry amassed against her . Librarians blocked her research ; the limit of confidentiality on documents was suspiciously extended from 30 years to 50 . When her phone was n't jangling with anonymous insults ( " Jewish whore ! " ) , neo-Nazi louts were tossing bombs into her bedroom . Official Passau saw her as das schreckliche Madchen , a troublemaker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice . It takes a nasty girl to go after the Nazi boys . <P> Verhoeven could have made a straightforward documentary on the subject ; in fact he did , as a companion piece to The Nasty Girl . But in this movie he dresses fact up as fable . Passau becomes Pfilzing , and Anja Rosmus is now Sonja Rosenberger , a precocious sprite full of life and full of herself . The movie takes its spirit from Sonja ; it is bold , nettlesome and great fun . <P> Verhoeven zips through his tangled story with all the brio of Brecht on a sunny day ; his style is comic , ironic , daringly distanced . The girlhood scenes are played for easygoing farce and shot in black and white . Then the film bursts into snapshot color when Sonja falls in love with her teacher ( Robert Giggenbach ) . Her hometown 's streets and churches are stylized back projections . The Nasty Girl moves like an eccentric dancer , ever shifting its pace and mood , never losing its poise . <P> Lena Stolze made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Verhoeven 's The White Rose . As Sonja she is greatly winning , and the film bathes in her saucy radiance . She whistles when Sonja is happy , and when the crusade finally turns her way , she ca n't repress an exuberant yodel . Sonja wants to be Joan of Arc , but she 's really Nancy Drew , doggedly sleuthing until she cracks a dark mystery . She can tolerate everything  --  the aged Reichmongers cloaked in propriety , the goons who threaten her children  --  everything but acceptance . When the town finally acknowledges her achievements , she must push it away . Who wants to be embraced and embalmed by Bavarian burgher smugness ? Not our nasty girl . <P> For Verhoeven , this chipper satire may be part autobiography ; his father Paul directed movies  --  operettas , mostly  --  during the Nazi era . So The Nasty Girl has perhaps allowed a gifted filmmaker to shake and break the bones of a family skeleton as well as a national one . German moviegoers have taken The Nasty Girl as if it were good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But to Americans , the dose will taste like sugar candy with magical nutrients . Rarely does a history lesson evoke a 95-minute smile . This one does .
