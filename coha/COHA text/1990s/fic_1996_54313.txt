While Michael Bishop 's novel , Brittle , was getting critical raves , Michael renewed his love affair with short fiction . In the last two years , he has published stories in Crank ! , Asimov 's , Science Fiction Age , and Century , with more forth-coming ( including another for this magazine ) . <p> About " Three Dreams in the Wake of a Death , " he writers , " The story grew out of a dream . I wo n't tell you which of the story 's three parts reproducers my real dreams or which two parts are attempts to create credible dream imagery . " It does n't matter : " Three Dreams . . . " is a powerful evocation of the father-son relationship . <p> i. provocation Toward morning lawson had a dream . He saw both his late father and himself , as a grown man , standing on the paved edge of a large natural pool . At their backs mingled and chatted a great many anonymous partygoers , all of them energized by the mild sunshine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them no heed , but stared down into the glassy waters . As if he had an underwater as well as a poolside vantage , he saw a Labrador retriever  --  the very dog his father had owned when Lawson was a boy  --  swimming like a robust black otter . This creature from Lawson 's childhood moved sinuously , playfully , through the water , then rocketed upward from the moss-furred bottom to catch in its jaws a large white fish , a kind of plump albino bass . <p> At this point , Lawson 's dream skipped several frames . He had the impression that the dog made several catches in a row , exited the pool without shaking , and carried each lovely white bass to the self-appointed cooks at the deep-frying vats behind him . Lawson focused , though , on the dog 's hypnotic underwater swimming , which came to an end  --  dissolving into another frame altogether  --  when an alligator more than twice the retriever 's length appeared in the water , immediately prompting the dog to climb out . <p> The alligator also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd or into thin air , while the partygoers went on about their merrymaking with no evident alarm . In fact , Lawson and his father stood calmly on the pool 's margin watching the alligator emerge . As it began to elbow-walk over the pavement , Lawson thought , This is a dangerous creature , its jaws can snap like metal traps , every person here is a potential victim of its appetite . That no one displayed the least sign of panic struck him as remarkable ; indeed , as crazy . Lawson 's father had enough sense to view the alligator 's presence as a bizarre intrusion , conceivably even as a threat . Instead of warning people away , though , he turned to Lawson and said , I 'm going to kick him in the butt , a macho boast so typical of his dad in life that Lawson could only gape , even though he wanted to say , That 's stupid , or Dad , you 'll put everyone here at risk , or How can you kick an alligator in the butt ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a long , wide , flat , leathery , ridged tail that hid and protected its anus . Did this tail , in his father 's eyes , qualify as its butt ? Lawson had no idea . His father seemed too miffed by the alligator 's party-crashing to care . He sidled up to it and booted it in a portion of tail behind one squat hind leg . The alligator leapt an inch or two on its front legs and swiveled its jaws . Lawson 's father skipped aside . <p> Horrified , Lawson looked on as the alligator , deprived of any chance to avenge itself on his father , swerved and scooted after the crowd near the metal cookers . There , just before awakening , he saw it seize the leg of a nine- or ten-year-old girl . <p> ii . shame A few days later , Lawson had slept for less than two hours when he dreamt again . His father appeared as a handsome thirty-five-year-old man , he as a nine- or ten-year-old boy . His chief private worry back then had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a ponderous ballet of mushroom clouds . This worry discolored every frame of his dream . <p> In the weeds along the bank of a small river , Lawson and his father , barefoot , found a dented metal boat . As his dad 's Labrador retriever went foraging among the cattails for muskrat or jackrabbit , they pushed this boat into the muddy water and jumped aboard . <p> Let 's go musselling , Lawson 's father said . He skinned out of his shirt , his shorts , his rumpled military boxers . <p> Lawson also shed his clothes , but more slowly : he had fewer muscles  --  mussels ?  --  than his dad and a tiny pale sex , like a pleated grub . His father laughed , not unkindly , then grabbed a rusted bucket from the prow and dove into the rippling surrounding brownness . <p> From the bottom of the river , his father began to lift bucket after bucket of ugly purplish mussels , sluice them clean of muck , and dump them into the boat . Arkansas oysters , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grainy bottom silt : tepid water lapped him at breastbone height . Although he wanted Lawson to dive in too , Lawson ducked his head and clung to the gunwales . His father 's naked muscles spooked him , as did the shells mounding at his feet like brittle mutant poker chips . <p> Whyre we doin this ? he asked . <p> Bivalve meat for Grampa Cody 's razorbacks , said his dad . Might even find a pearl or two . <p> No pearls in thesere ugly things . He kicked at them . <p> Mebbe not . But with just one , we could scoot up to Alaska and homestead us a place . Get in , his father said . You 'll blister up there . <p> Lawson 's boyhood self refused to budge . <p> Awright then . His father tossed the bucket toward the bank . Tumbling , it became a strange woman 's head , with bright red lips and fluttering blond eyelashes . Lawson felt relief when it disappeared among the cattails . Immediately , his father did a kipping sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the leathery water . Anxiety consumed Lawson . Also , the spray showering back on him burned like the fallout from a welding torch . <p> Meanwhile , his father swam relentlessly down . Lawson 's boyhood self could see him as if from an underwater vantage : the deeper his father went the clearer the water became , until at last it had the cold and mysterious dimensions of a cave lake . Lawson watched as his father circled down to an antique pub table at which sat three laughing women in gowns of seaweed and organdy . None of these mermaids was either his mother or the divorced Scotswoman with whom his father had recently set up housekeeping in Cheyenne . <p> In the boat , Lawsoh 's boyhood self got up , balanced arms akimbo on the middle seat , and peed in a hissing parabola into the water . <p> iii . confluence A week or so later , at approximately 3:30 A.M. , Lawson had another dream . This time his father  --  generally a graceful man only when swimming or diving  --  hustled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or maybe even the basement of some kind of government building . Carrying his paunch like a small pregnancy , he hurried past turnstiles , or sink basins , or filing cabinets , sometimes looking behind him and continuously muttering . The muttering seemed more amused than outraged . Even so , Lawson knew that his father was trying to escape a band of determined pursuers . <p> Lawson understood that he was one of the pursuers . A Labrador retriever  --  the very dog his father had owned when Lawson was boy - tugged him through the echoing spaces on its choke-chain . The dog barked only at intervals and then from deep within the ebony vault of its chest . At each bark , the catacomb rang as if from a pistol shot . Lawson could hardly keep up with the dog . He could hear the other pursuers , who nonetheless remained distant and unseen . Surveillance cameras , he believed , were taping the entire hunt . <p> Lawson 's father ran up a descending escalator and vanished over its lip . The black dog pulled Lawson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father climb a concrete slope toward an immense granite tower . This tower  --  a carving rather than a true building , despite Lawson 's first impression of it  --  dominated the barren cityscape . From its battlements , through its widest crenels , poured a waterfall . These streams braided into a clattering veil that billowed up at street level with neither spray nor runoff . Lawson 's father stepped through the waterfall and remained behind it , imprisoned . <p> Dad ! Lawson yelled . <p> The black dog yanked free of him , sprinted to the tower , and likewise jumped through the waterfall . Lawson hitched up the slope after it , a sudden searing pain in one knee . When he was close enough to part the water with his hand , he saw his father 's fractured image in the roaring backboil . <p> Come on in , son ! Water 's fine ! <p> I ca n't ! Lawson cried . <p> Then they 'll get you too ! his father said . Take ol Sonny 's word for it ! <p> Lawson knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would see Lawson standing there and surmise his father 's nearness , then shove Lawson aside and reach through the water to seize his father . Lawson 's knee ached . The ache had a stabbing counterpart in his chest . <p> Come on ! his father mouthed . Grinning , feinting , he boxed the falling water like a punching bag . <p> Lawson glanced down . The shimmering fabric of his shirt had begun to rain , it melted and ran in self-recycling threads , a tunic of rains . Clad in this shirt , he stepped quite easily through the waterfall . <p> A barking dog awoke Lawson , but he could n't find it from his window : nothing visible but drizzle slanting down in a streetlamp 's halo . <p> <p> <p> By Michael Bishop <p>
