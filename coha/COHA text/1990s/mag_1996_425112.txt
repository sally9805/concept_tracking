The snow in Direct Chute at Squaw Valley was either dense wind-packed powder or crusted-over old snow  --  we could n't tell which , because there were no tracks in it and this was our first day on the mountains . So instead of jumping right in , we stood at the top and checked out the conditions . We reached downhill as far as we could and whacked our pole baskets into the snow , discovering that the top of the chute was dense powder . We threw a few snowballs farther down into the chute and watched them sink upon landing : If there was a crust , it was a thin one . In the end we decided that Rob would avoid the cornice at the top and slide into the chute from the side , testing as he went . Then he 'd ski a tight , fall-line run right down the middle . Once he reached the bottom of the chute , he would shout back up , reporting on the snow texture . It turned out to be slightly wind-blown but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping right off the cornice and skiing a faster line , arcing long-radius turns back and forth down the chute and onto the open face below . Sweet Every time we ski demanding terrain , we go through the same basic assessment process . What 's the snow like ? Where 's the best line ? What combination of turn radius and tactics will work best for the existing combination of terrain and snow on this particular day ? If you choose correctly , your fun is maximized and your turns have an effortless flow . Choose incorrectly and the challenge becomes unnecessarily harder . A lot of this is just common sense . For example , shallow crud snow in an open bowl is great for smooth long-radius turns , while deep powder or crud in areas around rocks require more aggressive short-radius turns . When you can vary your turn radius and technique according to the conditions , you 're on the way to becoming a true all-mountain master , capable of skiing everything from steep faces to bowls to chutes to cornices , handling deep powder , wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's great skiing and a level of fun that few skiers realize . But enough generalizations . Let 's get specific . ( Photos omitted ) SEQUENCE 1 : NARROW CHUTE , POWDER SNOW Chutes are intimidating . If the slope were wider , most good skiers would have little trouble making tight turns right down the fall line . But the idea of doing the same turns in a narrow slot between rock walls can be scary . The answer is to take time to figure it out : Analyze the snow , decide how you 're going to ski it , pick your line , and then follow that plan . Let 's see how Rob skis a narrow chute at Craigieburn , New Zealand . The powder in the chute is thigh-deep , and the chute narrows at one point to a tight notch . Rob needs to use short-radius powder turns , weighting both skis equally and floating between turns . He can do this because of the aggressive moves he uses to power the skis into and then out of the snow with extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rush the turns or overly crank the skis around for speed control , because the resistance of the deep powder itself will help keep his speed under control . When scoping his line from the top , he planned to make three turns to get through the notch : a setup turn to position him at the start of the notch ( Figs. 1a-1b ) , a prolonged turn through the notch ( Figs. 1c-1d ) , and a braking turn to slow down again ( Figs. 1e-1f ) . ( Figures 1a - 1f omitted ) In Fig. 1a , Rob is just approaching the notch , the crux of the run . This is a critical move , because this turn sets him up to ski through the notch , which is not wide enough for his skis to fit through sideways without hitting rock on either side . Here Rob is in the first part of the turn  --  what we call the transition  --  when the skis and body are unweighted and feel as if they were floating : His skis , which are pointing right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the snow . His hips are low and slightly behind his feet . This position prepares him for the turn 's power phase ( Fig. 1b ) , during which he will extend his legs as his skis start to bottom out , pushing the tails down and the tips up . This finishes the turn and will launch him into a prolonged floating transition through the notch . Fig. 1c shows that transition through the notch . His upper body and arms are driving down the hill , which helps him retract his skis out of the snow and delay the start of the power phase . At the same time , Rob 's upper body is flowing downhill toward the exact point where the next turn will be . Figure 1d shows Rob coming down and into the snow at the bottom of the notch . In the long floating phase through the notch he picked up quite a bit of speed . With this in mind , he now presses forward onto his skis to make them go deeper into the snow for increased braking . Notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he is pushing a lot of snow in front of him . To counter the forward pressure he 's using to push his skis deeper into the snow , Rob quickly shifts his hips down and back behind his feet , pressing on both skis with his heels to bring the tips back up to the surface for the transition into the next turn . This movement pattern is the same as that used in the turn described above , in terms of extension and retraction of the legs . The only difference is that here , despite the braking effort of driving the skis deeper into the snow , Rob is still carrying a lot of speed , which launches him a bit into the transition ( Fig. 1e ) . Despite this extra speed , Rob maintains his composure and directs his upper body toward the next turn . His legs stay bent and his hips are positioned behind his feet , anticipating the resistance of the snow as the skis reenter it . By the end the third turn ( Fig. 1f ) , Rob has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep into the snow for additional braking , which will also set him up for the transition phase of the next turn . SEQUENCE 2 : CORNICE ENTRY In this next sequence of photos , Rob is entering a cornice above the Kitchen Walls off the Palisades at Squaw Valley . Most ski areas in North America do a good job of avalanche control and cornice safety so that inbounds cornices are safe to ski . This particular cornice has some new snow buildup from a light flurry with high winds . It is essentially stable except for the new edge . The snow below is classic spring corn : predictable and grippy yet soft for landing . The type of jump we are describing here is the same one you would use for any takeoff over a sharp drop  --  for example , over a small waterfall or cliff like those found at many ski areas in New England . Basically , this is a good technique for any drop where you are unsure of the conditions at the lip . In this instance at Squaw , the key move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The solution : A prejump with a little speed from three or four feet back so that Rob could just float over the lip of the cornice but minimize airtime . In Figure 2a , Rob is jumping up and lifting his knees for extra height and a compact body position to provide stability in flight . ( Figure 2a omitted ) Notice how his left pole is still planted . This action freezes the momentum on his left side , so he can initiate a left turn in flight . His right hand and arm drive slightly forward to begin this airplane turn and to act as a turn regulator while Rob is in the air . In Figure 2b , Rob holds his hands so low they can act as balance adjusters . ( Figure 2b omitted ) His skis are tipped slightly on edge , positioned for a left turn in the air . He is establishing his flight position as he comes over the cornice : an upper body perpendicular to the pitch of the landing hill and skis parallel with the landing hill . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has slightly pulled back his right hand to slow his rotation in the air . He has realized that the airtime is going to be greater than he expected at takeoff , so he shows the rotation to avoid having his skis land perpendicular to the fall line . Otherwise , with the snow relatively firm ( four inches of corn snow with firm underneath ) , the impact will be too great . It is better to land with your skis at about a 45-degree angle to the fall line and be ready to nail your first two turns to slow down , or be ready for high-speed long-radius turns , which is what Rob is doing in this photo . You would not want to do this if your were jumping onto a face with lots of rocks and trees . In Figure 2d Rob is beginning to extend his legs in preparation for touchdown . ( Figure 2d omitted ) His upper body is positioned slightly back from perpendicular to the slope ( to keep from being thrown forward when he lands ) . Notice that his skis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge contact immediately upon landing for a quick braking turn . Figure 2e shows Rob sinking onto his edges upon landing . ( Figure 2e omitted ) His shoulders are directed downhill toward the next turn , his hips are low , and his right hand is reaching for the new pole plant . The pole plant assures that his weight is directly on the edges of his skis , creating a solid platform from which to complete the critical landing turn , control his speed , and flow into the new turn . It 's a glorious corn-snow run from her on down SEQUENCE 3 : OVER A ROCK AND ROLLER In this sequence at Treble Cone , New Zealand , Eric uses a combination of pedal turn ( see next sequence ) and airplane turn to launch off a rock spine and into a chute . The snow surface is nice spring corn , very edgeable and pretty soft for landings . It does n't , however , offer the same braking properties as deeper powder snow , so he must keep his speed in check with a solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature is best handled by reducing your speed before you go off the rock , staying balanced in the air , and being prepared for a speed-control turn on landing . Figure 3a shows the classic steep position of a controlled edge set . ( Figure 3a omitted ) Eric 's weight is distributed over both skis . His shoulders are facing down the hill , over his edges , counterbalanced by his hips being into the hill . He is reaching for his new pole plant to keep his momentum flowing down the hill . Because he wants to lose vertical on this critical turn off the rock , his uphill leg releases the ski 's edge grip , allowing his upper body to move into position over his downhill leg . In Figure 3b his upper body has to move down the hill and over his skis to set up his move into the air . ( Figure 3b omitted ) His left hand is driving around through the arc of the turn , helping to create the rotational momentum for an airplane turn . His body has sunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squatting down before jumping off a porch ) . His hips are right over the heels of his bindings , yet counterbalanced by his shoulders , which are anticipating the new turn . His ankles are stiff , to maintain his upper body position over his feet as his skis and legs drop into the air , and he projects his upper body down the hill and off the rock . Figure 3c shows Eric extending into a more natural position as his hips and feet rotate down the hill into the new turn . ( Figure 3c omitted ) Figure 3d shows Eric in a comfortable flight position . ( Figure 3d omitted ) His feet are directly under his hips , his shoulders are facing down the hill , his upper body is perpendicular to the pitch of the landing hill , and his skis are parallel to the landing surface . He is ready for a soft landing and an immediate turn . SEQUENCE 4 : YOUR BASIC PEDAL TURN This last sequence is in the Extra Chute on Squaw Valley 's Palisades , which could be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular day , the snow is wind-packed : It 's soft enough to absorb some impact and help to bend the ski into an arc and firm enough to support a fully powdered arc without too much sliding down hill . The pitch is about 55 degrees for the first six or so turns , which will probably eat up about 80 to 100 feet of vertical . Skiing a pitch this steep , really skiing it , making short to medium round turns , requires a different rhythm than most any other situation . The idea is to control your speed by minimizing the vertical distance between your turns . If you blow a turn and end up sliding down the hill , either on or off your skis , you can end up at the bottom pretty quick . The steep technique we teach in our clinics ( and use in our skiing ) relies on several key elements : using the uphill ski to help finish the turn and start the transition ; employing a floating transition that flows into a smooth carve ; and adopting an aggressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squarely over both feet . In Figure 4a Rob is making his first turn in the chute after stepping off the cornice . ( Figure 41 omitted ) This photo freezes him in the classic steep stance at the very end of the power phase of the turn . His shoulders are directed toward the spot where he is making his next turn , which is pretty much straight down the fall line . His skis are evenly weighted with his shoulders over his feet ( note the snow coming off both skis ) , and he is poised to use his uphill leg to initiate the next turn . To start the turn ( Fig. 4b ) , Rob extends his uphill ( right ) leg and lifts his downhill ski up and off the snow  --  as his upper body begins to move downhill across his skis toward the next turn . ( Figure 4b omitted ) Check out how Rob 's shoulders and uphill hand are driving forward and down the slope as both skis are about to lift off the snow . Once both skis are floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , putting them on edge to carve and maintain his flow ( Fig. 4c ) . Notice his upper-body position , with shoulders facing the next turn . This spring-loads his lower body ( hips , legs , and feet ) for a quick , efficient floating transition , which will land him ready to are through the power phase of the turn . Finally , notice that he does n't lean or shy away from the fall line . To do that would take the weight off his edges , causing his skis to lose grip and to slide down the slope . Figure 4d shows Rob just beginning to touch down . ( Figure 4d omitted ) His skis are a shoulders ' width apart , and his hands are ready to drive forward and down the hill and toward the next turn . In Figure 4e , he 's in the power phase of the turn , with his skis fully loaded and his body weight centered over both skis . ( Figure 4e omitted ) Rob is planting his pole , and his upper body is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flowing into position to launch off the uphill ski as before . <p>
