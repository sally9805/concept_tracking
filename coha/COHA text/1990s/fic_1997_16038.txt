1 ESTABLISHING SHOT - EXTREME CLOSE - UP - COBBLESTONES - PARIS - 1 EARLY MORNING TITLE SEQUENCE BEGINS We OPEN with the screen filled with a dark gray , cut down the middle by a black crevice . We should be unsure of what we are looking at . Is it the surface of the moon or some primieval canyon covered in volcanic ash ? Just then a liquid with a yellowish tinge finds its way down through the crevice and further divides the screen in two , like a river border dividing East from West perhaps . CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal that the dark gray qhich filled the screen was in fact two paving stones on a Parisian street and the yellowish river that ran down the middle of the stones comes in two tiny streams that lead to two little boys , who are peeing on the pavement , laughing at their mischief . The boys are twins . They wear backpacks and are set to go off to school . Just then we HEAR the voice of a WOMAN shouting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( O. S. ) What do you think you 're going ? !

The woman shouts at the children from her window and the children run off . At the corner , fresh bread is being delivered to a sidewalk cafe , as chairs are set out at tables by white aproned waiters who are preparing for their morning clientele . CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal a taxi driver arguing with a deliver man as a husband kisses his wife goodbye and set off for work as we continue pulling back and across the city over Montmartre , picking up an argument between two drivers here , fresh bread being delivered to a cafe over there . Chairs are being set up at sidewalk tables as the city awakens and we float across Montmartre into a small residential quarter .

Section Details 2 INT . HOTEL ROOM - PARIS - EARLY MORNING The first thing we SEE in this shot which should appear seamless in its one continuous motion transition from the preceding scene , is a spider-web . We are TIGHT on the web in which a still-living insect struggles against his silky bonds . The web begins to tremble as from up above the spider drops , spinning thread lowering itself down on this latest victim , soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we become aware in the b. g. of the panting sounds of lovemaking . It is a woman 's breathless sighs and gasps we hear , but under that , perhaps a man 's voice , perhaps not . The sounds build to a climax as the camera continues to pull back until it discovers the glistening body of a beautiful young Parisian woman in post-coital dewy Nirvana . Then , the figure of a nude man in silhouette enters frame and crosses over to the shuttered window . His face and body are half-lit by the slats of light that penetrate from the world outside the hotel room . He lights a cigarette . CUT TO : ANGLE ON - CLOSE ON THE MAN whom we will come to know as CARLOS . He lights the cigarette and takes a thirsty drag sucking the smoke deep into his lungs , glancing out at the street and alternately at the spider who tiptoes down to her prey .

Carlos stands in front of a full length mirror in jeans and a blue work shirt over which he puts a worn grey jacket . He now looks every inch the young French student dressing down to look like one of the proletariat . END OF TITLES &nbsp; &nbsp; E. Carlos takes an M26 hand grenade and puts it into an inside pocket of his coat . He puts a machine pistol and snaps its ammo clip into it and puts it in his student 's shoulder bag and then takes a Walther PPK and places it in his jeans at the small of his back .

He offers the lit end of his cigarette . Carlos cups Jack 's hand . &nbsp; CARLOSMerci . He crosses away from Jack , smiling and goes inside the cafe . Jack follows him absentmindedly , tracking his progress through the windows , though his view is obscured somewhat by reflections of the street . Carlos steps casually to the railing overlooking the tables inside as Jack sees the double image of Carlos and the reflected streed scene . Carlos leans over , pulls the pin from an M26 grenade , and lets the " spoon " come off in his hand .

People are wounded , bloody and writhing in pain and screaming in panic .

Behind the reception desk are two circular staircases which  --  8  --  wind their way up to an elevator that is visible behind the railing at the top of the landing . There is what appears to be a security man standing at that elevator with an earpiece and tell-tale bulge under his jacket . &nbsp; CARLOS ( in German ) Pardon me .

He resets the gun back into the forearm position . He has a look of grim determination on his face .

BACK TO SCENE As the bus parks by the DC 9 , Carlos jumps out and waves to the media . Not the customary V-sign , but the wave of a celebrity . . . The hostages then , under their captors ' guns , file compliantly out of the bus and onto the plane . A line of exhausted , bleary-eyed middle-aged men in expensive suits and in need of a shave .

With that move he knows the gun will come slapping into his palm and he will be able to take Carlos out no matter what the cost . &nbsp; JACK ( smiling ) Eat shit and die slow .

CROSS DISSOLVE : To the Jerusalem stone paving stones that make up the square in front of the wall as we glide across the intersecting lines of paving stones set one next to the other until a glowing cigarette comes into view and then a foot which crushes it out . There should be something in this sequence that is reminiscent of our opening , a foreboding that just as the cracks in the Parisian paving stones led us to Carlos once before , perhaps these new stones will lead us once again to some act of terror .  --  16  --  NEW ANGLE to reveal a man standing in silhouette , the man who has just crushed out the cigarette .

He is disoriented , terrified , and then seemingly from out of nowhere , he is tackled , grabbed by the Arabs and dragged to a dark alley between two stores .

Light shoots in through shell holes and cracks in ruined walls . And yet , the interior is somehow soft , sensuous , with thick carpet , muslin drapes and a large bed that resembles at one and the same time , a boxing ring and an altar . She pays no attention to Ramirez . She does n't even acknowledge that he 's entered the room .

Her hand is her lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to let you exist , and then . . . you do exactly what I say .

So you go out there and have fun . He gives Joey " five " and Joey runs out to join his team at their dugout . Ramirez starts walking about toward Maura and the baby . As he does , he crosses next to another father , FRANK , who is with his son TYLER . Frank is about six foot four and to say that he is competitive would be the understatement of the year . He is harranguing his kid as if this were the deciding game of the World Series . He is on one knee so we do n't see just how big he is.  --  122 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there dickin ' around today , you understand ? Tyler looks at his shoes .

Tyler is still staring at his toes . &nbsp; FRANKHey , you think I 'm talking just to hear myself talk ? Look at me when I 'm talking to you ! Frank suddenly smacks him in the face . Annibal stops in front of the two of them . &nbsp; RAMIREZHey pal , lighten up , what do you say ? It 's just a game ? Frank looks at Ramirez and stands to his full six foot four . &nbsp; FRANKWhat did you say ? &nbsp; RAMIREZI said lighten up . It 's just a game and he 's just a kid . &nbsp; FRANKHe 's my kid . &nbsp; RAMIREZGreat . So why do n't we let our kids have a good time . Come on , I 'll buy you a beer . &nbsp; FRANKI do n't need you to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you stick your face in my business again and I 'll beat the living fuck out of you .

Your ol ' lady just saved your ass . &nbsp; MAURAAnnibal. . . please . . . Please . . . Maura tugs at Ramirez 's arm and Frank smirks . Ramirez cages the monster inside and turns with Maura . As he turns , Frank turns to Tyler as if he can not believe the boy is still there . &nbsp; FRANKWhat are you doin ' standing here ? ! You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move ! The boy hesitates . Frank rears back his arm to hit him . &nbsp; FRANKI said . . .  --  124  --  But before Frank can complete the sentence and strike his child , Ramirez comes flying through the air with a kick planted straight to Frank 's head . It is sudden and violent and brutal . He comes down and with one side-kick , " knee-caps " Frank , which is to say he hits the top of Frank 's kneecap and breaks it so that it is down around his shin . Frank starts to drop but before he can , Ramirez grabs his ears and brings his head down into his own swiftly rising knee . The result is devastating and Frank 's nose is now all across his face . Blood is everywhere and Ramirez does it again . Now the object is Frank 's teeth , so that when his head comes off of Ramirez 's knee , his mouth is a mass of blood as well . In slow motion , Ramirez turns and sees his son who stares in horror at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , maura is up and grabbing onto Ramirez . Ramirez however is not done . Frank is completely defenseless now and Ramirez leans him back across his knee , pulls him by the hair exposing his throat like that of a sacrificial lamb about to be slaughtered . This time instead of a knife , it will be a karate chop from Ramirez which will crush Frank 's windpipe and kill him . But before he can deliver the blow , Maura grabs his arm . He turns to her , almost about to hit her or throw her off and the two of them are face to face as Ramirez looks from her to his son and realizes how deep into the abyss he has plunged .

He hears the gunfire from the mansion . &nbsp; RAMIREZWhat the fuck ? 179 EXT . MANSION COURTYARD It 's a dark night , and only a few dim lights illuminate the rather large back yard . ON CARLOS Landing in a bed of flowers , he rolls , and is quickly on his feet with the machine-pistol in hand . ON TWO ARMED KGB Securing the courtyard , they rush to the spot where , apparently , they 'd seen him land . Carlos , however , is no longer there .

ANGLE ON RAMIREZ IN THE GRASS He sees to his horror that Carlos is getting away . He is ready to scream , going crazy . He has no gun , he would n't stand a chance against Carlos , but there is no way he is going to let him get away , no way . He looks around for a rock . . . anything .  --  143  --  There is nothing . Carlos turns his back . Ramirez sees his chance , he gets up on one knee ready to make his move when suddenly he sees two more KGB guys come running around the wall of the compound . ANGLE ON RAMIREZ He mouths the words : &nbsp; RAMIREZKill him . . . Kill him . . . ANGLE ON CARLOS He whirls and fires at the two KGBs who fall . ANGLE ON RAMIREZ He ca n't believe it . Carlos is getting away ? ANGLE ON CARLOS He suddenly gets a look as if he feels someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn when Ramirez comes flying out of the darkness and leaps on Carlos . The two are dressed exactly alike . Carlos is hit from behind and is stunned and drops the assault rifle . Ramirez has Carlos down and is choking him . Carlos looks up at him more shocked than anything else . Finally Carlos manages to break the grasp and kicks Ramirez off . Now it is a dazzling display of martial arts . Then Ramirez charges Carlos and tackles him and the two go rolling off into the bushes and darkness . When they roll out of the bushes we have no idea which one is which or who we should be rooting for . Just then Jack 's Volga drives up at the side . ANGLE ON THE TWO CARLOSES They roll over onto the bodies of two dead KGB . There is a Kalashnikov on the ground pointed into the Carlos on the bottom 's side . The Carlos who is on top manages to get his finger over to the trigger and pulls it sending a burst into the Carlos on the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and sees Jack standing over him with a gun pointed at him ready to shoot . In b.g. we HEAR cars with sirens approaching . The Carlos on top looks over to Jack who is ready to shoot him .  --  144  --  &nbsp; CARLOS ON TOPDo n't shoot . It 's me you asshole ! Jack just stares at him and then lowers his gun . &nbsp; JACKLet 's get the fuck out of here . He turns around and starts to get into the Volga . The Carlos on top , whom we just thought was Ramirez bends down and reaches for the dead K.G.B . ' s pistol . ANGLE ON JACK He gets that sixth sense feeling and turns around , his gun raised and pointed at the man whose hand is now on the pistol . Is it Carlos or Ramirez , who is standing there with pistol in hand almost turned to Jack but still at a disadvantage in this Mexican stand off . &nbsp; JACKHave you come looking for me now , Annibal ? &nbsp; THE MAN WITH THE PISTOLWhat the fuck are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time of year is n't it ? The man with the pistol knows this is a password of some kind and the look on his face betrays the fact that he does n't have an answer . Jack is just about to shoot him when a burst of machine gun fire is heard from the approaching cars and it rips into the tree next to Jack who dives for cover . That act of self-preservation gives the man we now realize is the real Carlos the chance he needs . With catlike grace he dives , rolls and vanishes into the shadows . He has gotten away and Jack has to decide whether to go after his quarry or rescue his friend .
