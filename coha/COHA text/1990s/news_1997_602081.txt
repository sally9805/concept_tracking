<p> CHICAGO  --  Maybe they 're not matches made in heaven  --  but close . <p> Love-seekers are swarming into cyberspace . <p> In the past year , on line has become the hot new place for finding sweethearts . <p> Benefits and dangers of this swiftly expanding trend will be debated at the American Psychological Association meeting , starting here Friday . <p> " The Net is what singles bars and mixers used to be , " says Stanford University psychologist Al Cooper . " It 's turning into the place for smart , eligible people to meet , " <p> Bill Stanfield , 47 , says he ca n't imagine marrying a woman after dating for only a few months . But he and wife Jacqueline wed in January after meeting last October , " and I 've never regretted it . There were no surprises . " <p> Of course , they did n't really date . They met on line . " We spent hundreds and hundreds of hours communicating . There were no distractions . . . I knew my first wife for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know her as well as I knew Jackie . " <p> The Stanfields ' courtship , peculiar as it sounds , is hardly unique . Love at AOL , an area on America Online designed for searching singles , began in February 1996 with 50 " photo personal ads " posted ; now there are 30,000 , with more than 700,000 visits to the area monthly . It 's the service 's most heavily used content area , says Anne Bentley of AOL . <p> Match.Com , largest independent dating service on the Web , offers 85,000 member " profiles , " adding about 6,000 new faces weekly , corporate vice president Fran Maier reports . <p> Why such a crowd ? <p> Surveys show Net traffic is dominated by affluent , educated 20-to 40-somethings , often overworked professionals for whom " dating is n't so great , " Cooper says . Many are " solid people , good long-term prospects but not good ' daters . ' The guys may be a little shy , they 're not adept at small talk and do n't have great pickup lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and values can feel a lot easier than hitting bars or " meat market " clubs , Cooper says . <p> Net liaisons can be " female-friendly " too , he adds : Communication is queen ; sex stays off the front burner ( at least for a while ) ; and guys do n't snub women if they 're not 10-pluses . <p> A feeling of intimacy often develops quickly . On-line talk lacks nonverbal cues that can put the brakes on romantic encounters , says Santa Clara , Calif. , psychologist Coralie Scherer . Disapproving glances , tone of voice changes , hesitance and breaks in eye contact are n't there . " All you know is what they tell you , " says Scherer , so honesty can make or break the deal . <p> The Stanfields , who married three months after meeting on line , quickly realized they shared a passionate interest in hiking , camping and outdoor beauty . " We were really honest with each other about our personal likes and dislikes , what we want out of life , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gender-bending " is so common that experts estimate two out of three " women " in many chat rooms , particularly the sex-oriented ones , are men . <p> Changing or omitting other truths is common . San Diego psychologist Marlene Maheu tells about one client , " an intelligent , sophisticated professional woman , " who recently flew hundreds of miles to meet a Net boyfriend and found " not only was he obese , but he looked considerably older than he claimed to be . " <p> Women play that game , too . New York psychologist Judy Kuriansky , host of a nationally syndicated radio call-in show , last month took a frantic call from a lady about to meet her longtime on-line sweetheart . She 'd neglected to mention she weighed 350 pounds and wondered what to do next . <p> " Omissions " can be more diabolical  --  even dangerous . Kuriansky recently heard a self-satisfied Michigan woman describe her " hobby " : She 's traveled coast to coast visiting cities she 'd always wanted to see , at male expense , her phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her address . " I 've heard of similar situations quite often , " Maheu reports . <p> Several new " Netiquette " books advise how to bring cyberspace romantic encounters safely down to earth . Looking for Love Online by Richard Rogers ( Macmillan , $ 12.95 ) suggests ways to sniff out phonies and crazies , and how to surround in-person meetings with safety nets and escape hatches . <p> Denise Beaupre , an Attleboro , Mass. , single mother , was pretty sure after three months of constant contact that her on-line friend , Scott Arena , was a wonderful guy . Still , she brought two friends to their first meeting ( and one friend brought a taser gun ) . <p> " He was a sweetheart from the beginning though . . . Look , I 've been followed home from bars . On line is much safer , if you 're careful about it . " <p> Net romance may be most threatening to addicts , those on line for many hours a week . And addicts also may behave most deceptively to would-be partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newfound link between Net addiction and clinical depression . Addicts may be " very vulnerable . They 're quick to jump into relationships but sensitive to rejection . " <p> Net addicts also are prone to donning on-line " personas " different from their everyday selves , her research shows . <p> " The chat rooms now are crowded with people who change their names daily . Who knows who they really are ? " grumbles Joan Bounacos . She and husband George met on line in 1990 , " the good old days , " married two years later and know a number of happily married couples matched years ago in cyberspace . <p> " Too many strange people are on line now , " Bounacos says , " and they want things to happen quick . . . We were just good friends for a long time . What you bring to it is what you 're going to get out of it . " <p> That 's exactly the point , argues psychologist Sherry Turkle , an MIT professor and author of Life on the Screen ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's studied several hundred adults who pursued relationships on line . <p> " It 's a living Rohrschach test , " Turkle says . The absent nonverbal cues and isolation make Net encounters akin to old-fashioned psychoanalysis in which patients " projected their greatest desires and fears " onto remote analysts . " They 'll tell me , ' I was deceived , ' and there is some deception . But when I look at their e-mail transcripts , I see less deception and more projection . These transcripts are often thin , people fill in the gaps as they wish . " <p> How the gaps are filled is the real tale . It 's often a positive one . She 's seen people use on-line encounters " as an occasion for self-reflection . They can learn a lot about themselves . " <p> New York writer Sally Banks says she did just that . And Banks , alumna of several on-line liaisons , author of Love Online ( Career Press , $ 12.99 ) , is a bit embarrassed to admit she met her sweetheart , " the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dogs in Central Park .
