<p> If you 've been turned down by traditional lenders in the past , even if you have a bad credit history or a lot of outstanding debts , you still can get a mortgage . <p> John Konrath was so certain the big downtown lenders would turn him down for a loan that he did n't even apply . He had started a new business that was sucking up all his cash . He was late with his mortgage payments as well as his auto payments . And he had medical bills . <p> Konrath wanted to refinance his home in the Beverly neighborhood of Chicago , paying off the first mortgage and the home equity loan , plus get some extra cash to pay off other bills . <p> So he turned to Mike Mangin at Oak Lawn Financial , a mortgage broker . <p> " Mike got me a market-rate loan , 8.5 percent ; at least it was a very competitive rate as of last summer , " Konrath said . " Mike helped me out a lot . " <p> Relaxed fit There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " sub-prime , " " non-conforming " or " B , C or D " mortgage or home equity borrowers . <p> Their loan underwriting standards are considerably more relaxed than those of traditional lenders . In some cases , the lenders do n't even verify how much you earn . <p> " You tell us what you make and we believe you , " said Sharon Rueff , district manager for World Savings in Deerfield . <p> Other lenders will give you a mortgage even if you 're in bankruptcy . <p> " We do everything from Fannie Mae to foreclosure , " said Jim Slowik , wholesale loan coordinator for Express Funding in Oak Brook . The first reference is to mainstream underwriting standards . <p> This is not to say these lenders will lend money to just anybody . They expect first-time buyers to put down at least 20 percent of the purchase price . Refinancers also will need to have at least 20 percent equity in their homes , and in some cases as much as 50 percent . <p> Traditional institutions lend money based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lends money based on a borrower 's equity stake . A large stake protects the lender , providing a big cushion in case he has to take back the home and resell it . <p> In addition , borrowers will fight to keep up with the mortgage payments if they have a large stake in their homes , he said . The last thing they want to do is lose their equity . " They may stiff Sears and stiff J. C. Penney 's . But they will make their mortgage payments , " Slowik said . <p> It costs more Although a few sub-prime lenders charge market mortgage rates , most typically charge higher rates , since they 're taking extra risk by lending money to people with less than acceptable credit records . <p> Most borrowers pay 1 to 2 percentage points higher . Those with the most serious credit problems may have to pay double the market rate . <p> The typical sub-prime borrower has a decent job , has owned his home for a number of years and at one point was an " A paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of a job left black marks on his credit history and he may be behind in his mortgage payments . <p> If the sub-prime borrower had lost his job , by now he 's gotten a new one , but it does n't pay as much as the old one . So he 's looking for a new mortgage to pay off the first mortgage while giving him cash to pay off bills so he can get on his feet again . He 'll refinance his sub-prime mortgage a year or two later after he 's straightened out his debt problems and improved his credit standing to " A. " <p> Because of massive corporate layoffs over the past year , that 's a description that could fit you or your neighbor . <p> The various types of sub-prime lenders : <p> Portfolio lenders These folks do n't sell their mortgages into the investor market but keep them in their own portfolios . So they do n't have to adhere to national underwriting standards . <p> One such is World Savings , which says it 's the third-largest savings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving mortgages to the self-employed or people who get paid in cash , like taxi drivers and waitresses  --  those who might have a hard time documenting their income , Rueff said . <p> While traditional lenders want to see W-2 forms or income tax returns , World does n't . It 'll make a " no documentation " loan if you put down 20 percent ( or have 20 percent equity ) and have excellent credit history , she said . <p> " If you 're paying your bills on time , you 're a good risk for us , " she said . <p> It 'll also give mortgages to recent college graduates with little experience in the workaday world , as long as the borrower has the income to qualify , she said . <p> Instead of the traditional 28/36 debt ratios , World will accept 33/40 and higher , depending on your bill payment record and other factors . <p> With 20 percent down , World 's rates are the same as its standard loans : 7.68 percent with zero points for the 30-year fixed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their loans to investor go-betweens Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , not all do . Some occasionally make sub-prime loans , especially to long-standing customers , and keep the loans in their own portfolios . <p> This is more likely to happen with a community bank or savings and loan , like Devon Bank at 6445 N. Western . Devon will stretch ratios to 30-42 and offer its standard market rate , said Chairman Richard Loundy . <p> It expects borrowers to have job longevity and to have a clean credit record . If there are black marks on your credit , the mortgage rate will be hiked 1/8 to 3/8 of a percentage point , Loundy said . Too many black marks and you 'll be denied a loan , he said . <p> Mortgage brokers These guys do n't make loans themselves but instead find a lender for you , traditional or otherwise . They 're your gateway to wholesale mortgage companies , which the man on the street ca n't deal with directly . Some wholesalers could n't care less about Fannie Mae guidelines . <p> A broker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finds one that will make you a loan . <p> Some brokers are experts in getting loans for B , C and D borrowers . But there is no standard definition of B , C or D borrowers , and there is no standard set of underwriting guidelines for the categories , said Larry Luckett , incoming president of the Illinois Mortgage Brokers Association and owner of Ficus Financial Services , 400 S. Green . <p> Brokers do n't try to fit all loan applications into strict guidelines but look at one application at a time , taking a closer look than a traditional lender would  --  and being very flexible . <p> " Just because someone has been turned down for a traditional loan , does n't mean they 're not creditworthy , " he said . <p> He said he does n't even look at the front end of the debt ratio ( the 28 in the standard 28/36 ratios ) , only at the back end ratio . His usual limit is 45 percent , but he 'll go higher if there 's a bigger down payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home equity loan . <p> Mangin , of Oak Lawn Financial , which actually is located in Oak Forest , will stretch ratios to 35/47 . But you 'll be expected to have held your job for a long time and to have a good bill-paying record . <p> Brokers often look beyond debt ratios , also factoring in disposable income , Luckett said . That means a borrower with a $ 2,000 monthly income would have $ 1,000 left over for bills and emergencies after paying the mortgage , and is a better credit risk than someone who makes $ 1,200 a month and has $ 600 left over after paying the mortgage . <p> The number of kids in a household also counts , as more kids mean more bills , he said . <p> Wholesale lenders Express Funding does n't decline many loans , Slowik said proudly . <p> It 'll make loans even to people who are still in bankruptcy or whose homes are being foreclosed . <p> The bankruptcy he 's referring to is not Chapter 7 , where you walk away from your debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you pay off your debts . <p> Mortgage rates for those in bankruptcy or foreclosure , " D paper " borrowers , can range as high as 16 percent , at least double the current market rate for 30-year fixed loans . The loan typically gives the borrower some cash to pay off debts , but at an interest rate lower than their previous combined debts . <p> " Traditional lenders turn up their noses at us and say that the rate is n't fair to anybody , but to me it 's being helpful , " Slowik said . " A lot of people are very grateful . Even with that high rate , they can be propped up on their feet and get a chance to clean up their acts . " <p> Wholesale , non-conforming lenders  --  accessible only through mortgage brokers  --  differ from traditional lenders in other ways , said Eric McKinnon , regional sales manager for Advanta Mortgage in Glen Ellyn . <p> For one , borrowers typically do n't need private mortgage insurance . Such insurance is a requirement for those who get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 20 percent . Private mortgage insurance typically adds $ 50 to the monthly mortgage payment . However , non-conforming lenders may buy this insurance for you anyway , paying the premiums themselves but building the expense into the mortgage rate . This way it 's tax deductible . <p> In addition , most non-conforming lenders do n't collect escrows for home insurance and property taxes , McKinnon said . This means more cash in your pocket month to month . <p> Traditional lenders typically require escrows and charge a quarter-point more in the mortgage rate if you do n't escrow , he said . <p> Finance companies It 's only been in the past few years that most finance companies got into mortgages and home equity loans , but now places like the Money Store offer first-time mortgages , refinances , home equity loans and " cash-out " loans , whereby the homeowner pays off first and/or second mortgages and also gets a chunk of cash to pay off bills . <p> " We usually do n't get into a public discussion of underwriting guidelines , " McNutt said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper " borrowers or those with chronic , on-going debt problems . <p> In mid-October the Money Store , headquartered in Union , N.J. , was quoting rates starting at 6.95 percent for a three-month adjustable ( 2 percent yearly cap , 7 percent life cap ) up to 14.5 percent for a 15- or 25-year fixed loan . <p> The best known finance company in the country , Prospect Heights-based Household Finance Corp. , does 65 percent of its business in mortgages and home equity loans . <p> It 's biggest business is in home equity loans used to pay off first mortgages while also taking out cash to pay off debts , said President Robert Elliott . <p> A typical HFC borrower is 45 , married , makes $ 35,000 to $ 50,000 a year , has little savings and lives paycheck to paycheck . If his income is interrupted , he starts falling behind in his bills and mortgage payments . <p> Elliott said A- borrowers at HFC would pay half a percentage point over market rates ; B borrowers , 1 to 1.5 percentage points more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are typical of the finance industry mortgage lenders , he said . <p> And that 's an industry that 's growing by leaps and bounds . Banc One Financial , Fleet Financial , Chase Financial and Chemical Financial are offspring of their better-known parent banks , said David Olson , head of David Olson Research Co. in Columbia , Md. , and an analyst of the banking industry . @x President Franklin D. Roosevelt inspired the standard test for a new president . In the famous first 100 days , inheriting a nation in a crisis even graver than ours , he saved the banks and got no fewer than 15 historic bills through Congress . Those 100 days set the rhythm for the rest of FDR 's first term : constant action , experimentation , and a dramatic expansion of the federal government he called the New Deal . How shall we mark President Obama 's 100-day report card ? The first thing that can be said is that President Obama is no longer the first black president . He is the president ; he has shed his skin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has clearly been popular enough , with an approval rating of over 60 percent so far . He has dominated the news , appearing on television in one form or another virtually every day . He has conveyed an unflappability -- a calmness and coolness under fire -- along with a seriousness and freshness of purpose . He has displayed a fluency of language that captures the intelligence and lucidity voters acknowledged when they elected him . He is now trusted by the people to explain what has to be explained as he leads us through a painful journey from the familiar to the unknown . His spontaneous clarity and articulation stand in contrast to his predecessor , even though Obama still lacks the great lines , the catchphrase , or even the humor that would help communicate the complexities of our predicaments . We are certainly getting words , lots of them , in what has seemed to be a perpetual political campaign , so much so that on occasion he seems to be a rock star rather than the CEO of the world . Still early . But the romance of campaigning is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hangover of the deeply unpopular Bush administration , a political fact that , if anything , has helped Obama . " Yes , we can , " he has said , and Americans repeat this mantra . The question remains , can he ? He had a great start when he surrounded himself with people of talent who are professional , experienced , and comfortable with one another -- and apparently can engage in open and candid conversation with the boss . His staff has proved able to move rapidly in the immediate crisis and , simultaneously , launch ambitious long-term efforts without much confusion or conflict . The result is a president who not only seems to be in charge but seems to have mastered the management of the presidency , a critical ingredient for a chief executive . We want our president to succeed . We want a presidency that works ; we know we can not afford a failed president . So politically , he has the wind at his back . But as Nelson Mandela once said , " There is no easy walk to freedom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a danger for the president , it is that there is often a gap between his rhetoric and his politics . He seems to trust his powerful rhetoric to obscure what he sometimes is or is not doing . So our faith in the future has not yet been fully restored nor our confidence rebuilt , for this will take place only when there is a sense that the Obama policies have been solidly grounded . Obama 's major hurdle is the collapse of the financial system . Without mending that , our economy will continue to flounder and unemployment rise : The gross national product grew markedly under FDR , but five years into the New Deal , 10 million people ( 19 percent of the workforce ) were out of work . Obama is to be commended for losing no time with his $787 billion stimulus plan , a bank financial restructuring package , a massive expansion of the role of the Federal Reserve Board , and housing recovery measures . On top of all that , he introduced an ambitious budget containing fundamental changes intended to transform and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama has the right priorities : More than 90 percent consider the economy to be the most important issue . No wonder . Sixty-five percent say it is difficult for them and their families to get ahead . Clearly , the economy presents the president and his party with the opportunity to establish a Democratic era . At the same time , they can not stumble on this , for if they do , their political capital will erode and the party will be vulnerable during the midterm congressional elections . The stakes could not be higher . Millions of people are jobless , billions of dollars are now dedicated to recovery , and trillions of dollars of additional U.S. debt loom . The stimulus program was introduced without delay , but it also demonstrated a troubling lack of political experience and toughness . It was fiercely partisan , attracting only three Republican votes in the Senate and none in the House . It gave the vastly weakened Republican Party the leverage to launch an aggressive attack , magnified by a 24-hour news cycle that focuses on sharpening differences . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be necessary . Too much of it applies to extended programs that will take effect too late , indeed after 2010 . Just last week the Government Accountability Office reported that only a small proportion of the funds , $49 billion , would go out to the states and communities by September 30 , and two thirds of that is for state Medicaid programs to maintain coverage and for preventing layoffs . The rest is for slow-starting state budgets and transportation infrastructure programs , with $108 billion to be disbursed in fiscal 2010 and $123 billion more to trickle out in the years to follow . A similar delay in delivery of dollars impeded the efforts of both Herbert Hoover and FDR . Achilles ' heel . So Obama 's program is simply inadequate to address the trillion-dollar-plus hole in national demand ( in 2009 alone ) that comes from declines in consumer spending , investment spending , and exports . This is the Achilles ' heel of his presidency , threatening disillusion . He will be blamed for overreaching , spending political and monetary capital on issues like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : recovery , recovery , recovery . It will not easily be forgotten that the stimulus package and the budget package both contained thousands of earmarks and pork to placate members of Congress -- something that he had promised he would no longer tolerate . But Obama let them get away with it . Moreover , his budget ( and the stress tests for the banks ) have lost credibility because of their wildly optimistic assumptions about long-term economic growth and the cost of the programs , raising fears that the fiscal deficits necessary for recovery will be bloated by dubious and even partisan policies . The partisan gap is manifest in the difference between the high approval by the president 's political base ( over 90 percent ) and the low approval from the opposition party -- the biggest gap for any president since the end of World War II . Obama 's rationale for dealing now with long-term problems such as healthcare and energy is that this is the moment to do it or , as some of his advisers have put it , let 's not waste a good crisis . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less overburdened administrations . Given that the programs have little to do with the short-term financial and economic crisis , they risk overloading the system and the ability of the public to cope . Many administrations are lucky to do one thing at a time , never mind two . But winning the economic war will be tougher when you are trying to jam a whole bunch of bills through Congress , particularly when they involve a huge expansion of federal spending . Franklin Roosevelt 's big mistake early on was to create the National Recovery Administration . It was meant to stimulate business and labor in new endeavors , but he had too much on his plate . The act was not thought through and flopped in a torrent of bureaucratic regulations discouraging to enterprise and threatening to individual liberties . So far , concerns over Obama 's policies have not translated into a loss of public support despite the rise in the numbers out of work . But how long will the public be patient ? The danger sign is that 53 percent of Americans believe his policies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made conditions better ; 16 percent say they have made things worse . Without real results ( in bank lending , in reduced foreclosures ) , the public may well conclude that he was trying to do too much too quickly while trying to deal with a financial crisis that could overwhelm any administration , let alone one that is trying to learn on the job . President Obama has had an outstanding start . He has demonstrated the capacity to lead and to manage on the national scale . For example , he is to be commended for his remarkably forthright reform views on education and his determination to connect all Americans on the Web . He speaks forcefully on behalf of introducing more merit pay for good teachers and dispensing with bad ones , and creating more charter schools because of their successes . This is remarkable because it is a frontal challenge to one of the most important support groups of the Democratic Party , namely the teachers unions . Obama is courageous in his insistence that education is a critical issue . Education , including retraining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country will be shaped and ensured . Yet his convictions and charm will be enough to carry the country forward only if his policies are adequate to meet the financial and economic crises . Similarly , his willingness to meet and treat with the enemies of America will not pay dividends ( notably in dealings with Iran , Iraq , Afghanistan , and Russia ) unless America 's economic strength is restored . There is a palpable sense of hope in the country , even as everyone 's eyes are trained on one person : Obama . He is our nation 's leader and teacher who still retains the trust of the class . He has succeeded in evoking huge expectations and hopes ; the challenge now is in living up to them .
