Some deciduous trees , shrubs , and vines remain verdant year-round <p> WHEREVER THERE 'S a true winter  --  a bleak time when virtually nothing grows  --  gardeners seem to long for the sight of something green , something obviously alive and healthy to help sustain them until spring . All too often , this sort of longing results in the planting of numerous evergreens . It is true that evergreens provide winter interest , but because they do not change much from season to season , I find that they quickly lose all interest . <p> That 's why I 'm so fond of the deciduous trees and shrubs whose stems , branches , or bark remain green all year . They bring a touch of fresh , hopeful color to the winter landscape and , as they leaf out and flower , offer interest in other seasons as well . In addition , many of these plants will survive in harsh , windswept locations such as hilltops or city terraces , where desiccating winter winds make it almost impossible for even the hardiest conifers to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a number of these deciduous evergreens . Each of them is suited to a range of climate zones , but some are of course more hardy than others . The hardiest among them are Cornus sericea and its cultivars , a group of shrubby , multistemmed dogwoods . Most of these have red stems , but in the case of Flaviramea ' the stems are a bright greenish yellow , almost chartreuse , depending on the time of year and the way the light hits them . They start the winter green , then gradually become more yellow by spring . A less common cultivar , Nitida ' , has stems that remain a pleasant pea-soup green throughout the winter months . <p> I think C. sericea looks best when planted in fairly large masses , which is the way it grows naturally from northern Canada to Virginia ( USDA Zones 2 through 8 ) . If planted in full sun in the moist , almost swampy conditions it prefers , it will grow rapidly , reaching about seven feet in height and perhaps a little more in width in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a corps de ballet of slender branches reaching eagerly for the sky . If planted at the top of a rise  --  or anywhere that you can see it backlit  --  the stems will glow astonishingly against the pale-blue winter sky . Like several of the other green-stemmed plants I will describe here , the dogwood 's youngest stems are the most vividly colored , so every other year or so in early spring I cut the oldest ones back to the ground to encourage bright new growth . <p> Another particularly hardy green-stemmed plant is the winged euonymus , or burning bush ( Euonymus alata ) , which many gardeners plant solely for the scarlet color of its fall foliage . But I also admire the lovely color of its branches in winter . When young , these are a smooth , soft green . As they grow older , " wings " appear  --  long , craggy , irregular ridges of pale , tan , corky bark that run the length of each branch . The combination of the pure-green youthful branches and the tan-striped mature ones creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to about 10 feet and is broader than it is high . Its wide-spreading habit and the tendency of its branches to fan out horizontally give it a rounded silhouette similar in shape to a mound of snow . Its habit and its elegant , deep-green leaves make this euonymus useful as a specimen shrub or as an unobtrusive background plant . You can use it as a hedge or prune it as a small tree . A mass planting at the curve of a driveway makes a stately welcome . This plant is hardy in Zones 3 through 8 , grows in situations ranging from full sun to fairly deep shade , and will do fine in any moisture-retentive soil as long as it does n't get waterlogged . <p> Broom is a deciduous shrub that is often mistaken for a true evergreen . Its leaves are so small and sparse , its grassgreen stems so fine and dense , that it is easy to understand the confusion . Broom makes a soft , delicate member of a shrub border , its bright , slender stems contrasting with those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viburnum rhytidophyllum ) . It also can be used to edge or frame a perennial border , or act as an informal hedge . <p> Warminster broom ( Cytisus Xpraecox ) , Scotch broom ( C. scoparius ) , and dyer 's broom ( Genista tinctoria ) are the most commonly available . Warminster broom is the most massive of the three , reaching about 10 feet to the Scotch broom 's six feet and the dyer 's broom 's ground-hugging two to three . All are graceful , fine-textured shrubs that offer a brief , brilliant profusion of fragrant yellow flowers in mid-spring . Scotch broom cultivars with flowers ranging from pink to rose to purple are also available . <p> All three brooms are hardy in Zones 5 through 8 , with the exception of the dyer 's broom , which is able to succeed as far north as Zone 3 . They do best in full sun and sandy , rather dry soil . In my Zone 7 garden heavy snow sometimes bends the branches so that the tips touch the ground . It makes a lovely sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring back to their normal upright position . In exposed sites along the coast , however , some branches may die back over the winter . <p> TO ME , ONE OF THE MOST disheartening sights of winter is a bare , gray stone wall against a gray winter sky . This is where winter jasmine ( Jasminum nudiflorum ) quietly shines , with its smooth , bright-green stems trailing over the stone 's rough surface . This exuberant shrub is exceptionally adaptable and fast growing ; a single plant quickly forms a tangle of slender stems in a mound about three feet high and 10 feet across . If it is n't controlled it can become a weed , but it is a welcome sight in the dead of winter , particularly in late winter , when brilliant-yellow flowers appear on the otherwise naked stems . Winter jasmine often blooms for many weeks , but because the blooms are sparse , the effect remains predominantly green . It does quite well in poor , dry soil and can take some shade , though it flowers better in full sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A shrub that provides a fairly dense screen even in winter is Kerria japonica . Its bright-green stems grow straight up , then arch gracefully to form a rounded , twiggy mass about six feet high . In my front yard , I have grouped three plants of K. japonica Pleniflora ' , a double-flowering cultivar that my neighbor has dubbed the " marigold bush " because of the color and shape of its blossoms . Here it flowers twice , once for about three weeks in the spring , creating a fountain of gold , then again more sparingly in the late summer and fall . <p> Kerria japonica is hardy in Zones 5 through 9 . It requires good drainage , especially in colder climates , but is otherwise an undemanding plant . It prefers some shade , doing well even in full shade , but also can withstand considerable sun . Like Cornus sericea , its newer branches are brighter green and more attractive , so cut out the oldest ones each spring after the plant flowers . <p> Trifoliate or hardy orange ( Poncirus trifoliata ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often planted as a barrier hedge . While it is more tender than the green-stemmed shrubs mentioned above , it grows well as far north as Zone 6 and should be used more often . In winter every part of this small , low-branched tree  --  from the trunk to the branches to the vicious , two-inch thorns  --  seems to have been spray-painted a bright , even , glossy green . The overall effect is angular and unexpectedly lacy , especially when backlit by a low winter sun . <p> Fragrant white flowers in spring and perfect balls of yellow-orange fruit ( also fragrant , but too bitter to eat ) give year-round interest , though the plant flowers and fruits better in the more southerly zones . As a barrier , it is at least as effective as barbed wire and certainly more attractive . It also makes a fine summer background for other flowers and shrubs . Because it is fairly wind-resistant , I 'd like to see it used on more city terraces . <p> Another tree to plant for winter interest is the golden chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinctive flat top is usually grown for its one spectacular week of bloom in May , when long , drooping clusters of yellow , wisterialike flowers seem to pour from its branches . For the rest of the year it is less showy but no less valuable . Its smooth bark is a pale olive-green that accents the tree 's natural elegance and does n't darken with age . <p> If you plant the golden chain tree in groups of three to form a small grove , the green effect of the bark is intensified . I have such a group planted in front of some low , spreading Japanese yews ( Taxus cuspidata ) . In winter the yews ' deep , almost black foliage highlights the trees ' soft-green trunks ; in spring , the yews ' creamy-green new growth lends a sunlit quality to the green-on-green texture of the laburnums ' leaves and branches . The tree is also beautiful combined with the variegated dragon's-eye pine ( Pinus densiflora Oculus-draconis ' ) . The texture of the pine 's long , fine , cream-and-green banded needles works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Laburnum Xwatereri is n't cold hardy enough for the Far North and can suffer sunburn in the Deep South , but in its range ( Zones 5 through 7 ) it grows well in full sun to light shade . Moist , well-drained soil helps this lovely tree withstand the twig blight that sometimes affects it . <p> Although technically none of these plants are evergreens , their effect is " ever green " and most give the added bonus of flowers . And because they are hardy in a range of climate zones , no gardener should have to endure another winter without the heartening touch of color they provide . <p> For sources of plants mentioned in this article , see page 66 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Cornus sericea <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Jasminum nudiflorum <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Laburnum xwatereri <p> By Cynthia Gillis <p> <p> Landscape designer Cynthia Gillis gardens in Brooklyn , New York . <p>
