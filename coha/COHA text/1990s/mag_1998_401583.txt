Killer sateLlites , monster space stations , super spy cameras , and a trip to the moon were all on the agenda of the once " evil empire . " // UNTIL RECENTLY , detailed information about Russian spacecraft was n't easy to find . During the cold war , it took years for even the simplest drawings to be released , and photographs were often grossly retouched . The past few years , however , have brought a torrent of revelations about space hardware developed in the former Soviet Union . Russian historians and journalists , no longer forbidden to investigate or publish information about once-secret space programs , are rewriting Soviet space history . Museum directors who squirreled away secret exhibits , some of which had been ordered destroyed , are now revealing their hidden collections . And Russian space organizations are releasing documents and photographs in an effort to earn the respect and trust of potential Western customers . " All of this is aiding in the piecing together of the history of space flight , " says NASA chief historian Roger D. Launius . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its space activities , even to the extent of denying that there had ever been plans to land a cosmonaut on the moon , but now we are beginning to learn the full extent of the Soviet space program and its considerable capabilities . The release of documents and hardware has prompted a reconsideration that would have been impossible before these materials became available . The result has been a blossoming of comparative space history , as new understandings have emerged . " Soviet pictures , government reports , memoirs , and interview transcripts at last provide a full view of what went on behind the curtain of secrecy . A few of the newly released images have opened windows on secret Soviet programs that were suspected but never proven by Pentagon experts . For example , images of the Polyus-1 spacecraft confirm that in 1987 the Soviets were preparing to launch a space-based anti-satellite weapon that would have set off a massive arms race in space . To help ascertain just how formidable the Soviet space program was and to predict what the new Rus- sia may contribute to mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled a gallery of secret Soviet spaceships . Some of these craft actually flew ; others existed only on paper . They represent some of the most significant space programs undertaken in the Soviet Union during the 1960s , ' 70s , and ' 80s . The U.S.-U.S.S.R. race to the moon in the 1960s was exciting chapter in the history of space exploration . But historians were puzzled when , after the Apollo triumphs of ' 68 and ' 69 , the Soviet Union denied it had ever competed to land men on the lunar surface . That 's why these pictures were top secret for decades : They show actual spaceships built by Soviet engineers in a stealthy drive to send cosmonauts to the moon ahead of American astronauts . In the photo below right , an unmanned test vehicle called Zond sits atop a giant Proton rocket at the Baykonur space center in Kazakhstan , awaiting launch toward the moon . Zond was the precursor to an anticiapated two-man follow-on flight , as evidinced by the launch escape system on its nose . Designed to pull a capsule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only on spacecraft that are intended to have humans aboard . But there were too many booster and spacecraft failures in 67 ' and ' 68 , and the Russians never cleared the Zond spaceship for manned flight . For their planned lunar landing mission , the Soviets upgraded their Soyuz Earth-orbit vehicle to take two men into lunar orbit and back . They called the new spaceship the L-1 . At least one such vehicle was prepared for an unmanned test flight in 1969 , but the test failed when the L-1 exploded . To land on the moon , the Soviets developed a miniature lunar module that would carry a single cosmonaut . This spaceship , called the L-3 , was even tested in Earth orbit without human passengers . Since the lunar landing would have relied on failure-prone rockets and would have required a cosmonaut to transfer from one ship to another in open space , even the Russian assigned to the first mission considered the assignment " sporty . " Recalls Aleksey Leonov , " It 's probably just as well I did n't have to actuaLLy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space ambitions were at an all-time high in the mid-1980s , when the Mir space station and Buran space shuttle were being built . Looking several steps beyond these spacecraft , Soviet engineers designed a reusable eightperson ferry called Zarya , intended to fly to space stations that would be much larger than Mir . Using a scaled-up version of the tried-and-true Soyuz capsule , the engineers replaced the " burn-away " heat shield with reusable tiles like those on NASA 's space shuttle , and moved the touchdown-cushioning rockets from the center of the spacecraft to the rim . // The 26,000-pound capsule , twice the weight and size of the Apollo capsule , was intended to carry crews and supplies into space and back . It was to be launched on the new Zenit rocket or carried into space in the cargo bay of the Buran shuttle . A two- or three-person version would carry 3 tons of supplies , and an all-passenger model would carry eight cosmonauts routinely and 12 in an emergency evacuation . Begun in 1985 , the project was canceled in ' 89 when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shuttle and future big space stations were scrapped . Zarya was briefly considered as an escape vehicle for the crew on the International Space Station but was deemed too expensive even in that role . ZARYA SUPPLY SHIP SNAPSHOTS FROM SPACE In the ' 70s , the Soviets launched a series of 20-ton Salyut space stations on year-long orbits and sent up crews to visit them for months at a time . Western observers suspected that the Salyut name covered two separate projects , one for civilian scientific research and one for military appLications , including reconnaissance . The Soviets provided vehicle drawings and onboard photographs of the civilian version , and even allowed reporters access to training mockups . But for the " other " version , only a few fuzzy televised onboard views were ever released , and it was n't until ' 97-almost a quarter-century after the first flights - that Western journalists were able to see the military Salyut ground simulators . Photograph ZARYA SUPPLY SHIP // This recently released cutaway drawing shows why . The space station contained a massive spy camera for observing U.S. military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for film canisters that could deliver pictures back to Earth while the cosmonauts continued in flight . One of these canisters was auctioned at Sotheby 's a few years ago , and brought $42,500 . More recently , the Russians have begun trying to find Western commercial customers for such cameras and entry capsules . ANTI-SATELLITE SYSTEMS Considering its history , Russia 's obsession with defense against intruders is entirely understandable . So as soon as foreign satellites began orbiting overhead 40 years ago , the Russians began work on weapons to destroy them . They chose to build a " co-orbital " anti-satellite system that could fly into space to seek out and destroy target satellites . This 3,000-pound spacecraft , the world 's first space weapon , was test-flown in 1963 . Its military purpose was disguised . Labeled PoLyot-1 , the vehicle was said to be a peaceful spaceship designed to practice maneuvering in orbit . For 30 years , not a single image was ever released , until Western visitors to a Russian space factory noticed a strange object in a historical display area . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no longer on display . Photograph // Between 1968 and 1983 , the Soviets Launched a series of " killer satellite " tests , using a warhead derived from the Polyot vehicle . In public , these devices were announced as scientific research satellites , but no photographs were ever released . Only in the past few years have pioneering Russian space historians dug out and published the view shown here . STATION DEFENSE The Soviets always suspected something sinister from NASA 's professed peaceful space exploration , which they feared hid plans to attack Soviet space vehicles . ( That 's because the Soviets knew that their own " peaceful " proclamations were really propaganda covers for the secret development of space weapons . ) So when Soviet engineers designed the Salyut manned space stations for military missions , they included versions carrying defensive weapons , from cannons to lasers to space-tospace missiles . This drawing shows a manned space station armed with missiles . It was never built . Throughout the early1980s , the Soviets were working on their own versions of Star Wars , weapon systems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was delayed , the opportunity arose to use the first Energla rocket to instead launch a 100-ton payload of space weapons hardware . This super-secret weapons payload became known as Polyus , or Pole . When it was launched in May 1987 , Soviet space officials simply called it a " size and weight dummy mockup . " Photograph KILLER SATELLITE POLYOT-1 // Polyus was actually a black cylinder 37 meters long and ti.1 meters in diameter , with an off-the-shelf space tug at one end . PoLyus possessed deployable tracking targets and large tanks of gases to be released into the ionosphere . The craft also carried a " Skif-DM " apparatus ( probably an antisatellite laser ) and , according to some reports , a rapid-fire aircraft cannon . Although the project had been approved by earlier Soviet leaders , apparently Mikhail Gorbachev was never fully briefed . When he traveled to Baykonur to watch the launch , he reportedy was horrified to discover that the Soviet Union was about to orbit a " death star " that would jeopardize his diplomatic campaigns against Star Wars . Gorbachev allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be activated once it reached orbit . As it turned out , the space tug misfired , and Polyus fell into the Pacific Ocean .
