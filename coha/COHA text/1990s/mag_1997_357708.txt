As one of those quaintly Jurassic old fogies who still keep an address book  --  more portable than a palmtop , after all  --  I recently came across a problem : my little book was filling up even though my Christmas-card list was not . In short , the number of my friends was not increasing , but the number of numbers of my friends definitely was . How do I call you ? Let me count the ways ( even a Catholic hermitage I sometimes have to contact now has two telephone numbers , a fax number and an E-mail address involving the words monks and contemplation ) . <P> I 'm not , I hasten to point out , a zero when it comes to digits : I 've dealt for years with postal code numbers , telex codes and apartment-block addresses like 99-34 67th Road ( #6D ) . But now , all of a sudden , I have to list extension numbers for voice mail , fax numbers for home ( thus doubling the number of numbers to list and , in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cope with a digital dearth ) and http : // 's . To reach a friend a few blocks away , I have to type 38 letters that mean nothing , a numeral , two underlines , an ampersand , a hyphen and two periods , all in a uniform , dotty sequence that will go nowhere if I add a single space or omit a stroke . <P> My two-room apartment in Japan , where I write this , has an address six lines long that winds through a confounding sequence of dashes , numerals , English words ( Memphis Apartments ) and lyrical Japanese terms that sound as if they escaped from the Emperor 's New Year haiku ( " the Southern Slope of Deer " is the meaning of one ) , all of which is doubly embarrassing since , as everyone knows , the Japanese do n't have street addresses . And to call my office from this apartment involves a seven-digit access number , a 14-digit personal code and then another 14 digits . The days when I used to laugh at the Orwellian sterility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example ) seem remote indeed . And the days when New York City telephone numbers were humanized by letters  --  " Call me at LUddite 4-2628 "  --  seem positively predigital . <P> I suppose I first noticed this profusion when first I inscribed a six-digit post-office box number into my book , at almost exactly the same time as ZIP codes ( which arrived on our shores only in 1963 , to cries of " governmental harassment " from Hunter S. Thompson ) began more insistently including four extra digits and a dash . Suddenly , the 213 area code for Los Angeles had sprouted seven alternatives , and French phone numbers were 10 digits long , and my friends were stockpiling spouses ' names upon their own . Here in Japan , my three-digit postal code spawned two extra digits , and even as I was writing this , a circular arrived to inform me that , as of next February , my tiny rural neighborhood will get 17 new postal codes , all seven digits long .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
