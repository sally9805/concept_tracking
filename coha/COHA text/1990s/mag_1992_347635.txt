THE END CAME WITH ALL THE BITTERNESS of a military surrender . For weeks General Motors chairman Robert Stempel had tried to ignore the signals of discontent radiating from a hostile band of outside directors . When Stempel was hospitalized with an attack of high blood pressure , board members did not bother to phone him get-well wishes . When rumors flew that Stempel was about to be ousted , the board issued a statement that conspicuously lacked a denial . Finally , Stempel , 59 , bowed to a point-blank demand from a third-generation GM board member , who told him it was time to leave the post he had taken scarcely two years ago . <P> Even then , Stempel showed flashes of defiance , disdaining an offer that would have allowed him to save face by resigning for health reasons . Instead , he laid the cause of his departure at the feet of the directors , thereby calling attention to the board 's handling of the coup they seemed to be planning . Declaring that " the effects of rumor and speculation " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the helm of the world 's largest company . <P> The resignation of Stempel , a popular " car guy " who was the first engineer since the 1950s to run the company , stunned employees who had heralded him not long ago as an automotive redeemer who would bring out the best in GM . Like soldiers in a conquered army , many roamed aimlessly last week along the corridors of the company 's limestone-clad Detroit headquarters . The ouster shook even Stempel 's union adversaries , who feared what life would be like after the boardroom coup led by John Smale , 65 , the hard-charging retired chairman of Procter &; Gamble . Smale has emerged as a possible Stempel successor and the real power inside the embattled company . <P> Employees braced for a take-no-prisoners conquest . Together with president Jack Smith , 54 , the former head of GM 's profitable overseas operations , Smale and the board seemed poised to purge Stempel 's top lieutenants and embark on a sweeping new round of layoffs to restructure the former flagship of American industry . " GM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longtime supplier . " It is faced with total upheaval caused by an outside force  --  something that once was unthinkable . " <P> The bloodletting promises to be deep and wide and painful . Impatient with Stempel 's slowness in carrying out plans to close 21 of GM 's 120 North American plants and cut 74,000 of its 370,000 employees over three years , directors now want to eliminate a total of 120,000 jobs during the decade . A major goal : to slash GM 's labor costs of nearly $2,360 per car , which is almost $800 more than Ford 's and $500 more than Chrysler 's . " It 's going to be brutal , " warns a GM director . " If the unions wo n't cooperate , GM will have to play real hardball . We do n't even have the luxury of thinking about a product strategy . We are n't going to be thinking great thoughts . GM has a three-year mission to restore its financial soundness . "                @ @ @ @ @
