Cliches may be cliches , but they are usually also true . The great nuggets of conventional wisdom about Southern California  --  the easy embrace of novelty , an approach to creative endeavors largely unencumbered by tradition , a profound attachment to cars  --  are not only apt ; they have converged to form an extraordinary new center for automobile design . <P> Most cars are still dreamed up in Detroit and Turin , Wolfsburg and Tokyo . But virtually all the world 's major automobile companies  --  18 to date  --  have established design departments within an hour or two of downtown Los Angeles . The Japanese were first . Then came special think tanks run by America 's Big Three . So far , an estimated two dozen production-model cars have been shaped by the new California design colony , including , of course , the delicious , almost perfect , and instantly successful Miata , designed by four young Americans ( and a Japanese ) working for Mazda in Orange County . Now the influx has accelerated , and even the Germans have deigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audi last spring and , just last month , BMW . <P> Pleasant weather is only part of the attraction . There is a collective sense that to design for Americans requires understanding them viscerally , and a belief that Los Angeles is not just the wellspring of car culture but as close to Ur-America as any one place gets . More prosaically , Southern California represents the biggest automobile showroom anywhere : every year 3% of all new cars on the planet are registered in California , and most of those in Southern California . If you 're to succeed in the U.S. , you must sell in Southern California . And to do that , observes Peter Fischer , a marketing vice president at Volkswagen , " you have to see , feel , smell what these customers want . " Says Mark Jordan , who was Mazda 's chief designer on the Miata : " If you can excite the people in California , the rest of the country will take care of itself . " The world 's car companies have been drawn to L.A. by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that has always pulled in immigrants . Detroit has been creating cars its own way for 75 years . In Europe and Japan the conventional wisdoms can be confining , even stultifying . " We selected a place like San Diego for our design studio , " says Gerald Hirshberg , Nissan 's chief U.S. designer , " because it had no track record , no history . It feels like almost anything is possible out here . " <P> But the rationale is not simply the need to meet the demands of the American car market or harness the spirit of innovation . From the homogeneous vantage points of Japan and Germany , the exuberant free thinking seems to be a function of L.A. 's slam-bang Anglo-Afro-Latino-Asian ethnic mix  --  cultural democracy by default . " The Southern California area is like a melting pot  --  there are so many different races , " says Mitsubishi vice president Satoru Tsujimoto . " From those different backgrounds , there are many different values . So there are many different designs . " For companies acutely conscious of their need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disparate sensibilities and experiences , California seems like an unsurpassed multicultural proving ground .
