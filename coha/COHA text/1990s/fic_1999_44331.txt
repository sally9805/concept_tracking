ARIEL ' S daughter , Finny , accidentally pushed a classmate off the jungle gym at recess , and the unlucky girl hit her head , hard , on the way down . She was knocked out , and after she stood up and wobbled into the building , she had a seizure ; the other children , including eight-year-old Finny , stood in a knot around her as she thrashed as if in rage on the tile floor . A ribbon of urine from the fallen girl approached Finny 's shoes . <p> Mariel got the phone call at work . <p> In four days they were supposed to leave the country on a long-awaited family vacation , and she worried , glancing at the message from the school nurse , that Finny ( a nickname for Fiona ) had a cold or the flu . Goddamn lousy timing , Mariel thought , dialing the nurse 's number and scanning her desk for what could be worked on at home , what could be canceled , what could be transferred immediately to the trash . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week , and Mariel hoped she would recover by Saturday morning , when they would board the plane in Minneapolis for Cancun , strap themselves into their seats , and inhale four hours ' worth of recirculated air , which Finny declared made her vomit . <p> " I 'll let you talk to her , " the nurse said , in response to Mariel 's question about how Finny was feeling . Mariel thought this was a little odd-did the nurse have no diagnostic skills ? The phone clicked . She heard a shuffling . A sniffle . " Finn ? Finny ? Is that you ? " She pictured her daughter 's round face , a sweet freckled pie , the short braids ragged and uneven because Finny had wanted to braid them herself . <p> " I hurt Nan , " Finny said . " I did n't mean to . " <p> " Nan who ? " Mariel asked , searching beneath her desk for her shoes . " You are n't sick ? " <p> " I pushed her , " Finny said . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copious amounts of self-deprecation , and Mariel did n't want to let her get started . <p> " Of course you did n't mean to . " Finny 's sniffling was probably the result of some sadistic line of questioning at the hands of the school nurse , a broomlike woman with short thick hair that stood up unnaturally on her head . True , Finny had a tendency to be clumsy-some kind of lapse occurred between what her body felt and how it moved . Still , she was a gentle and shy girl , emotionally frail , and now she was obviously traumatized . " Is Nan at the nurse 's office too ? " <p> " No , " Finny said . <p> " She 's back in class ? " <p> A pause . <p> " Finny ? " <p> " They took her away , " Finny whispered , and Mariel could hear the tears gathering , the monsoon clouds massing just offshore . <p> " I 'm sure she 'll be fine , " Mariel said , but the phone had been repossessed by Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick up your daughter and stop by the office , " Mrs. Wassler said . Mariel heard Finny sobbing . " I 'll keep Fiona here with me . " <p> ONE of the things that most often surprised Mariel about being a parent was the desire for other parents ' approval . Some days , despite her better understanding , she felt , regarding Finny , as if she had produced an object out of clay and placed the object on a table to be evaluated , compared . No one could argue that Finny was the brightest in a sizable group of children , or the best-looking , or the most adept . Oh , but look ! Mariel wanted to say . No child on earth could be more endearing , more humanly whole . She knew that . She understood Finny 's graces . Still , there she stood at the edge of the table , nudging her sweet imperfect object , both of them subject to the whims and critiques of passersby . <p> She tried to resist evaluating her only child , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so sensitive , so easily discouraged . She was bound to be one of those girls , Mariel knew , who would look into the mirror at thirteen and suffer from the lovely roundness of her face , her strong and shapely forearms , her dusky hair . She was a highly compassionate child , prone to cry at the sight of roadkill , and timid in the face of cruelty . Though she liked to play with other children , she often preferred to play alone , and her games were eccentric and imaginative , unintelligible to others . Mariel loved her so fiercely that her teeth hurt when she looked at Finny ; at the same time , she felt in herself the desire to correct her daughter , to pinch and mold her-a little more confidence and sass , a little less fear . <p> On the way into the school building Mariel had to walk a gauntlet of older children , and she could n't help wondering if they knew who she was , if they knew about " the accident " or had leaned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stunning to see the fifth- and sixth-grade children , some of them huge , the girls with breasts , the boys tackling one another , already needing feminine notice and encouragement and approval : they mugged and opened the door for Mariel in a kind of rehearsal for the upcoming mating dance , displaying their gaudy colors like so many birds . <p> She found Finny asleep on the nurse 's blue-plastic couch , her dress hiked up , a hole near the crotch of her tights exposed , her head lolling back against the wall . So vulnerable . How could Mariel allow her outside in the world unguarded ? Mrs. Wassler , thank God , had been called to officiate at a skinned knee somewhere ; the assistant principal filled Mariel in . The other girl , Nan , had been taken to the hospital around noon ; apparently she was stable , but she 'd had a concussion and would probably be kept overnight for observation . The family was listed in the phone book if Mariel wanted to call them . <p> Mariel looked at Finny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead unless she was having nightmares , in which case she lurked around the edges of her parents ' bed like a nervous spirit . Now she lay limp and removed from the world , as if planning to sleep for a hundred years . <p> " I 'm sure it was an accident , " the assistant principal said . <p> " Finny 's a great kid . " <p> Mariel felt hideously , profoundly grateful . " I know that , " she snapped . After wrenching Finny from sleep , she signed an absentee paper and took her home . <p> DURING the car ride Finny was quiet , morose . She nodded her head very slightly to some kind of internal music , a habit that made her look obsessive . Mariel reached over the back of her seat and touched Finny 's cheek , to stop her . When asked how the accident happened , Finny dutifully replied , as if she 'd been coached , " I was n't careful . " <p> " Did you help her up ? " Mariel asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Finny said . " She was crying . " <p> " Accidents happen , " Mariel said . <p> Finny was nodding her head again . <p> " Maybe we 'll call her when we get home , to see how she 's feeling . Do you think that 's a good idea ? Finny ? " <p> " She 's in the hospital , " Finny said . In the rearview mirror Mariel could see only the cinnamon-colored smudges that were Finny 's eyebrows and the zigzag part in her hair . When she adjusted the mirror to see her better , Finny moved out of her line of sight . <p> " The hospital has phones , " Mariel said . " Phones in every room . " <p> " She might not know it was an accident , " Finny said . <p> " Well , " Mariel said , " that 's just another reason for us to call . " <p> At home , though , Mariel discovered that calling was n't easy . The injured child 's first name had apparently been shortened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a tangle of consonants . Either the admissions clerk had spelled it wrong or the hospital did n't yet have the girl on record . Looking up the family 's home phone number in the school directory , Mariel understood from the address that the family was poor . Nan did n't live within walking distance of the school , in one of the comfortable suburbs , but was probably bused in on one of the yellow trawlers that cruised through the white neighborhoods , small , tired faces at every window . <p> For the first few hours no one answered the phone . Finally , in the late afternoon , a child answered . No , her mother and father were n't there . Who was this ? <p> " A friend , " Mariel said , hating herself . Finny was playing on the carpet in the other room . " We wondered how Nan was doing . Is she better ? " <p> A radio in another language was clamoring for attention in the background . " Nan 's better , " the voice said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You want to talk to Nan ? " <p> " No , that 's fine . But she 's at home ? " <p> " Nan 's at home . " <p> " That 's great , " Mariel said . " Thanks for telling us . " She looked at Finny , who was clearly listening . Whoever was on the other end hung up the phone . " Do you want to know what they said ? " <p> Finny did n't move . She was hunched over a pile of coins that she was supposed to be learning to count ; instead , twisting the assignment in her own odd way , she was wrapping each coin in a piece of paper and masking tape and then dropping it into a plastic cup , <p> " They said she 's better . Maybe you 'll see her in school tomorrow . " <p> Finny shook the paper-covered coins , scowled into the cup , and unrolled a longer strip of tape . <p> " You can apologize again , " Mariel said . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " She wo n't be in school , " Finny said . <p> " Why not ? " Mariel hated to think of Finny as a junior fatalist . <p> " She just wo n't be . " Finny 's shirt was a little tight , Mariel noticed . Finny developed crushes on articles of clothing and did n't like to let them go . <p> After Finny went to bed , Mariel unwrapped a few of the paper-covered coins ; then she gave up and threw the rest away . <p> AS always when crises came up , Mariel 's husband , David , was traveling . She talked to him late that night on the phone . <p> " So she feels sad about it , " he said . " Even guilty . How could she not ? That seems appropriate . It 'll teach her to be more careful . " <p> David 's sunny disposition could be annoying . Though on a day-to-day basis it was essential ( he buoyed and steadied them , both life preserver and anchor ) , the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insane . He was an overgrown Shirley Temple . <p> " She already knows she was n't careful , " Mariel said . " She 's already got the hair shirt on . That 's not the problem . " <p> " Did we sign her up for T-ball again this year ? " David asked . In an effort to socialize her and improve her coordination , David had pushed Finny into organized sports the summer before . Holding the bat or trying to catch the ball , she had looked miserable and ill suited to the game . Observing his daughter 's wretched performance , David had cheered while Mariel writhed in the stands ; poor Finny was rooted like a post out in left field , as if her arms and legs , her very body , were a reproach . It occurred now to Mariel that Finny had looked like that on the way home from school ; she had climbed into the back seat of the car gingerly , treating her body like a weapon or a foreign thing . <p> " I see no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was n't painful . Finny 's fine . You worry about her too much . " <p> Mariel could hear him shuffling through a set of papers ; she hated it when he multi-tasked her , working while he talked to her on the phone . " I think she 's depressed , actually , " she said . " I might make a phone call about our tickets . " <p> The shuffling stopped . " What about them ? " <p> " Well , I 'm not sure we can waltz off and leave if this girl is still injured . I have n't talked to the parents . And maybe Finny should see a doctor . " <p> " She is n't the one who hit her head . " <p> " She is n't happy , " Mariel said , wanting to cry . " I think any person her age deserves to be happy . " <p> David sighed . Maybe , secretly , he detested her , Mariel thought . And why not ? It probably showed good judgment ; at such moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to cheer Finny up , " he said . " It 'll do her good to get away . Think how much fun she had last year . " This was the ultimate argument , of course ; how could she deprive Finny of going ? Imagine making her stay at home , making her think she was being punished . <p> " I 'll go if we can drink a lot , " Mariel said . " Starting earlier in the day than we did last year . " <p> " We 'll start on the plane , " David said , " if that 'll make you feel better . " <p> " It might . " <p> " Mariel , " he said , " you know , different people are happy in different ways . " <p> " Tell me about Finny 's way , then . " <p> David hesitated . " It 's different from ours , " he said . " I 'll see you soon . " <p> THE next morning Finny did n't want to go to school . Mariel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that it had arrived , her strategies for combating it seemed absurd . She felt listless and impotent , unable to resist the sight of Finny in her favorite dog pajamas , an inch of flesh showing where the top did n't meet the pants . <p> " One day , " Mariel said . " You can stay home today , and that 's all . Not tomorrow . " Together they ate muffins in the kitchen in their pajamas , Mariel halfheartedly reading the paper , nothing but major and minor disasters everywhere , and pushing aside the dirty dishes from the night before . Finny ate half a muffin , dissecting it for raisins and nuts , and then slipped away from the table to start one of her peculiar games , putting Cheerios into a set of plastic cars and sending them on trips around the kitchen floor . <p> " Maybe Nan 's home today too , " Mariel said , without knowing she was going to say it . " Maybe you were right-maybe you 're both taking sick days . " <p> Finny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mariel saw her open the little door to a plastic car , take out the oat  --  flavored occupants , and eat them . <p> " We 'll call her-and then we 'll call the hotel in Mexico and ask them how hot it is there today , " she said , knowing that the newspaper in her hand listed international forecasts on the second page . " It 'll be good to have hot weather for a change , wo n't it , Finny ? " <p> The girl shrugged , her broad back a site of pathos . She drove her army of edible passengers out the door . <p> AT noon Mariel took a break from several hours of indifferent progress on the computer and called a friend at Finny 's school . The friend , Anna , was a teacher 's aide , a woman who volunteered in her son 's classroom to the extent that she might as well have been home-schooling him . <p> " Oh , I heard , " Anna said . " Poor Finny . Poor Nan . This is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mariel said that she was n't sure what it was , or how to classify it , but she was hoping it was over , and had anyone at school talked to Nan 's family ? The girl was n't back at school yet , was she ? <p> There was a pause . " I think Dorothy , the social worker , talked to them , " Anna said . <p> The tone of her voice gave Mariel the sensation that her stomach had suddenly been flooded with cold water . " What did the social worker say ? " <p> " Well , I think she 's still bleeding from the ear , which is n't good . But she did wake up a couple of times . She 's still in the hospital . " <p> " But I called them , " Mariel said . " I talked to them on the phone . No one said anything about bleeding . Just yesterday they said she was home . " <p> " That 's probably a language issue , " Anna said . " Two of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full names are really long . We always get them mixed up in the school records . " <p> Mariel 's eyes filled . " What does that mean , that she 's bleeding from the ear ? " <p> " I only heard this secondhand , " Anna said . " Are you keeping Finny home ? " <p> Mariel wondered if Anna was implying that Finny should be kept at home for her own safety . Would a playground vendetta form ? " We 're so sorry , " Mariel whispered , speaking for herself as well as Finny , and also , she realized , addressing anyone who might hear about Nan and imagine that Finny was too young for remorse . <p> When Mariel hung up the phone , she saw Finny standing behind her in the hall . She was stock-still on the carpet , her body soft , listening . <p> " Nan 's not home yet , " Mariel said . It was all she could think of to say . <p> Finny nodded . " She might stay there for a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oracle , a seer . <p> " Do n't say that , " Mariel said . <p> Finny sat down . <p> " What 's in the car ? " Mariel asked . " Are they little people ? " <p> " Yes , " Finny said . " But they do n't know that that 's what they are . " <p> " What do they think they are ? " <p> Finny paused . " They only think they 're people when the door shuts behind them , " she said . " Then they remember . " Mariel watched her put a Cheerio behind the wheel of a blue Camaro . The door clicked shut . Finny looked up at Mariel , who smiled and tried not to shiver . <p> The cargo of doomed and ignorant passengers waited , helpless , on the floor . <p> THE next morning , Thursday , Finny did n't want to change into her school clothes or brush her hair . " You ca n't stay home forever , " Mariel said , realizing that despite her dictum of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If one day , why not two ? Why not four ? This was an opportune moment for Daddy 's cheerful demeanor , but of course Daddy was n't home . " Up , up ! " Mariel said , lifting Finny beneath the arms , but the effect was more violent than fun . It took her several minutes just to get a clean shirt over Finny 's head . " Listen , Fiona , " she finally said , " there 's a saying about getting right back on a horse after you fall off it , and school is the horse in this instance , and Nan 's accident is the fall , and you have to go back to school afterward . You ca n't stay home . I 'd be a lousy parent if I let you stay home . You do n't want me to be a lousy parent . " <p> Finny stared down at her toes . She had short , flat feet , like little paddles . Sometimes Mariel thought that Finny had inherited the worst of her parents ' characteristics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweaty toes , pushing the arms into the sleeves of a pink sweater , brushing the fine , beloved , tangled brown hair . Clipping a duck-shaped barrette into position over one ear , she looked at Finny 's sweet face and saw unmistakable dread . She felt she was dressing her only child for slaughter . <p> " It 'll be all right , " she said , considering and rejecting the idea of letting Finny stay home for a second day . How had she ended up with such a horribly sensitive child ? She personally knew plenty of children who could have pushed a dozen playmates off the jungle gym ( or even off the roof of the school building ) and never batted an eye . The difference was that those other children 's victims were always fine . Finny had had bad luck . And maybe that was part of the problem : Finny was beginning to believe herself unlucky . Mariel held her by the shoulders and looked into her speckled eyes . The world was full of horrifying things-dead children turning up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other illness-from which , despite misgivings , Mariel had tried to shield her daughter . But it had n't worked : Finny sensed the existence of disaster , and was afraid . All children were fearful now and then , but Finny 's kind of fear was different . She was n't afraid of lightning or the dark . Mariel looked into Finny 's eyes and saw that Finny was afraid of herself-of her own body and the harm it could effect , of its awful dangers , of its secret , unintentional power . <p> WHEN Finny was born , Mariel , more than David , had been terrified . He was the oldest in a big family and remembered carrying and feeding his brothers and sisters ; calm and confident , he cradled seven-pound Finny in one arm and swooped her around the house , singing tunes from South Pacific and Oklahoma ! Mariel tried to imitate his casual attitude but could n't ; she was convinced at every moment that something gruesome was about to happen . Finny would choke on a button , or swallow poison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . Mariel 's mind was an endless catalogue of accidents that could rear up like monsters in the lives of the unsuspecting . She was relieved when Finny turned three and then four and five ; she seemed further from danger , sure on her feet , less liable to kill herself out of sheer ignorance . <p> But now that the obvious , dreaded physical dangers were past , and Finny could walk and ride a bike and swim and recognize a skull and crossbones and recite her address and phone number in case she found herself lost among helpful strangers , an entirely new set of hazards was revealed , and they were internal . No matter how vigilant Mariel was , no matter how carefully she stood guard , she could n't interpose herself between Finny and Finny 's imagination . She was doomed to pace outside the inner room and hope for the best , like an old-fashioned husband waiting for news of his child 's birth . <p> And Mariel suffered doubts and anxieties of her own . Some days , reading the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashing to an end-and how much easier it would be , how much more bearable , if she were n't in the position of having to explain it all to innocent Finny . These are the things we 've done wrong , here are our crimes , this is how we 've fouled our nest and murdered one another , and now we hand this ugly , uninhabitable conglomeration on to you . She was beyond being able to speak about this fear , even to David . Especially to David . At times , horrified at her own train of thought , she almost wished that Finny had n't been born . <p> DAVID came home early and unexpectedly in the middle of the day and called Mariel at the office . " I talked to Varda , " he said . " He does n't mind if we visit . " " Visit ? " Mariel asked . " Varda who ? " <p> " Nan 's father , " he said , as if it were obvious that he had canceled a meeting , flown home early , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , and now knew the injured girl 's whole family by their first names . " She 's at Children 's Hospital . Sixth floor . Meet me there and then we can pick Finny up together after school . " <p> " Right now ? " <p> David waited , exhaling . Mariel looked at the mess on her desk . " All right , " she said . " I 'll meet you in the main lobby in an hour . " <p> IN the full-length bed with its metal side rails , Nan Gnundatridgida seemed to be half the size of Finny , her limbs no larger than sticks . So small , Mariel thought . The girl 's thick black hair lay uncombed against the pillow ; a tube invaded one delicate nostril , and bruises up and down her forearm indicated multiple attempts to start an IV . Mariel wanted to collapse at the very sight of her , to kneel at the foot of the bed and press her forehead to the floor . <p> In the hallway David had introduced himself to Varda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shoulder . David was an ideal presence at any sickbed ; calm and friendly and soft-spoken , he never threatened to fall apart or cry . Now he swept the black bangs away from Nan 's forehead . " She 's beautiful , " he said , and in fact she was . He wrote their phone numbers on the back of a get-well card . The worst moment of the visit came when the little girl 's mother walked through the door , carrying a doll and a cup of coffee . There I am , Mariel thought , and now I 've walked into a room and caught sight of the monsters that did this to my child . She wanted the other mother to throw her coffee , or shout , or try to push Mariel out a window . Instead the woman barely looked at them or spoke ; she sat in an orange-vinyl chair beside the bed , put down the coffee and the doll , and began to stroke her daughter 's arm . She did n't have time for anything but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hell ; she had time only to coax her daughter back from the strange new territory she had entered on her own , to summon Nan back and see her healed . <p> Later David tried to downplay the mother 's reaction . It was probably part cultural difference , he said , part sleep deprivation , part language barrier . The important thing was that the doctors felt Nan was getting better . It was definitely a concussion ; and yes , she 'd had a seizure . But she was periodically waking , and the signs were good . One of the nurses had offered to keep them informed . <p> Still , Mariel felt poisonous , depressed . " We wo n't tell Finny we were here , " she said , spying their separate cars in the parking lot . <p> David looked shocked . " I already told her . I stopped by her classroom on the way over and got her to make a little card for when Nan wakes up . I left it on the nightstand . I thought it would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mariel thought . A piece of construction paper as a means of healing . David talked on and on , describing his conversation with Finny 's teacher . Mariel watched his lips move , interpreting the words as they left his mouth . She had heard about people who took their young children to wakes and funerals to expose them to death and mortality , people for whom every hideous and painful aspect of life was a teachable moment . She wondered if David would want to do that , and whether he would be capable of turning the whole unpleasant mess with Finny and Nan into some kind of fuzzy cultural-awareness lesson . Sometimes Mariel felt amazed that she had married-what an odd custom , joining forces for life with an alien being . <p> " You said you were n't worried , " she said . " But here you are , home early . " <p> David walked her across the parking lot . As she drove away , she saw him looking up at the sixth-floor windows , one hand in his jacket pocket , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON Friday afternoon David spoke to Varda again ; Nan was slowly improving , and she had eaten soup and toast . Having made up her mind to do so , Mariel made a speech in bed that night . She was grateful , she said , that David had made contact with Nan 's family . She was ashamed of herself for not setting such a forthright example for Finny . <p> David rolled toward her under the covers . " I was n't doing it only for Finny . " <p> " No , but it 's a good thing , " she said . " It was a good thing to do no matter why you did it . " <p> David 's hand navigated the tangle of flannel sheets and found her hip . He was vacillating , she knew , between harbors : sex on the one hand , and the rocking cradle of sleep on the other . She decided to wait , to see what he would choose . <p> The hand twitched once and then trailed away . " It even occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help discourage a lawsuit . " <p> " A lawsuit ? " Mariel said . " What do you mean ? " Astoundingly , she had never even thought about a lawsuit . <p> " I doubt it would happen , " David said . He kissed her and thumped his pillow . He did n't often talk about his personal demons ( maybe he reasoned that acknowledgment alone would afford them a kind of reality or power ) , but lying awake as his breathing slowed , Mariel knew that they were waiting in the dark regardless of whether she understood them , or whether she discerned their ragged shapes in the midnight air . <p> THROUGHOUT the trip the next day , in the cab , in the airport , and in the plane , Finny insisted on sitting close to David-maybe because she had missed him , Mariel thought , or maybe because her mother had proved to be useless during this stressful week . <p> During takeoff the fact that Nan was still in the hospital made Mariel clench her teeth in dread . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the poor girl lingered in the hospital ; it was tantamount to begging the gods to strike them down , to hurl bolts of lightning at their very section of the plane . For Finny 's sake she forced herself to offer bubbly comments about the week to come . Finny was quiet ; it was hard to know whether to attribute this to motion-sickness tablets or to depression . She fell asleep over New Orleans , flopping across an empty seat , and Mariel hoped that someone would look at her in disapproval , or ask her to move her bare feet farther from the aisle-Mariel would personally rip out that person 's hair . <p> At the airport in Cancun the heat and light entered them . Mariel felt transported . Travel always gave her that sensation-of stepping through a door into a new , exotic compartment in which she would eat someone else 's food and sleep in someone else 's bed , while her own life lay flat and uninhabited at home . <p> They spent the night in town and then rented a car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wild hibiscus , wrinkled women selling pots and tortillas at the edges of the smaller roads . The resort that they had come back to was out of the way and subdued , a quiet beach without college students or discos , just a few miles of white sand and phosphorescent blue water . Their room was a separate little thatched-roof structure halfway between the tiled swimming pool and the Caribbean ; the year before , Finny had wandered dreamily between the two bodies of water every day . <p> Mariel wondered if this year would be different . Let there be pleasures in life that I receive without earning or deserving them , she thought ; let some of these unmerited pleasures remain the same . She unpacked all their clothes , reciting fervent agnostic prayers in the stifling room , while David walked Finny down to the beach . Mariel took it for granted that neither of them would have thought to apply sunscreen . <p> " What do you think ? " David asked her that night , as they watched the sun melt into the exuberant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her drink-she had lost count of what number it was-and answered absently that she 'd seen too many plants , too many birds , too much water , for one location . Everything here existed in abundance , as if to point out the stinginess of their own uninspired northern landscape . <p> " No , I meant Finny , " David said , and instantly Mariel was alert . What about her ? What did he think ? How could she have let her mind wander ? <p> Finny was asleep on a cot in the room behind them , the door propped open with a stone . <p> " I think she loves it here , " he said . " I think she was born for this kind of climate . " <p> " She 's already sunburned , " Mariel said . <p> " I mean temperamentally . She loves the sun , the heat . I think winter makes her pinched . Down here she can be more open . " <p> Mariel often wondered if David analyzed Finny the way she did-if he spent an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She did n't play with any of the other kids , " she said . " She spent the whole day by herself . " <p> " She likes being by herself . Those kids were jerks . " This was true . The other American children , all of them skinny and loud and absurdly normal , more like ads for children than the real thing , had screamed and cavorted and plunged obnoxiously into the pool all afternoon , while Finny , ten feet away , had methodically made slits in the center of several dozen leaves , inserting a stick and two blades of grass into each leaf and laying the altered flora on the sand in an intricate pattern . At such moments Mariel suffered dual and opposite visions of Finny 's future : she might end up a lumpkin , an eccentric in a hillside cabin ; or she might be a visionary with a sense of humor and compassion , a pioneer . <p> " Did you get through to them on the phone ? " David asked , without looking in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her glass . <p> " I saw you take the phone card out of your wallet after lunch . " <p> " Spy , " she said . <p> David reached into his own wallet and took out a piece of paper with a number on it-the same number she had called that afternoon . " I figured I 'd let you do it , " he said . " And maybe you 'd let me know if there was any news . " <p> " I tried and tried , but I could n't get through . " <p> David put down his drink and walked to the blue-tiled steps that lead into the water . He turned to face her , but Mariel could n't see his expression . He might have been welcoming or reprimanding . <p> " Of course I would let you know , " Mariel said . But she had probably spoken too late . David submerged himself in the water , disappearing into the thick and fragrant shadows at the edge of the pool . <p> HE did n't ask about any of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took her snorkeling , and haggled over an ankle bracelet in the square . Meanwhile , Mariel struggled with unidentifiable coins , credit cards , phone cards , and Spanish recordings she could n't understand . Finally , on the third day of the vacation , a margarita in hand though it was only noon , she heard a small miracle in the receiver : " Children 's Hospital . Where may I direct your call ? " <p> Mariel could see the ocean , two hundred yards away . The sun on her arms was a blessing . She closed her eyes to deny herself the beauty of the view . But there was a second miracle to come : Nan had been discharged and was now at home . Mariel spelled and respelled the family 's name . Yes , the nurse was sure , the little girl with the concussion , she had definitely been discharged . Mariel spilled half the margarita onto herself with joy and then drank the rest of it in a swallow . She walked down to the beach to share the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Shading his eyes and smiling , he looked up at her from his chair . <p> " Do n't you want to celebrate ? " Possibly she had been obsessive and preoccupied ; now , at last , she was ready to relax . <p> " I thought we were celebrating . We 're drinking and eating out every day and sitting on a beach and spending money with abandon . What else do you think we should do ? " <p> " I do n't know , " she said . " Something . " <p> " Do you want to tell Finny ? " <p> Of course she wanted to tell Finny . Finny would be relieved . Would n't she be relieved ? <p> David pulled his lounge chair into the shade of a drooping palm . <p> Mariel sat down . Finny would be happy to know that Nan was fine , but she might still feel the same fear , the same sort of doubts about herself . She had still caused damage to Nan , whether or not the damage was undone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Finny in a little while . David was reading , the tip of his nose only inches from his book . She took two aspirins from her bag and watched the Mexican lifeguards under their thatched-roof palapas . At a distance they reminded her of something Finny would like to play with-mobile little figures in tiny houses on the sand . Two of the guards were gazing around at the scenery with binoculars , probably zeroing in on topless bathers . Mariel was formulating a cynical remark along these lines so that she could pass it on to David ( he was n't a cynic himself , but Mariel suspected that he secretly appreciated cynicism in other people ) when two of the guards leaped down onto the sand and sprinted up the beach and into the water . Mariel stood up on her towel to watch . Just a few hundred yards away someone was waving from a raft . People were pointing and shouting in Spanish . She could see the two guards swimming furiously through the turquoise water ; they were headed toward a second raft that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A lump rose in Mariel 's throat-how ridiculous , to get choked up in total ignorance , no idea at all what was going on . Walking toward the water , she could see that the guards were pulling the more distant raft to shore . Was someone on it ? Abruptly she felt panic crack open like an egg inside her : Finny . Wildly she looked around at the gathering crowd of gawkers on the beach until finally there was Finny , completely apart , facing away from the action , standing in the water up to her ankles , oblivious , poking at the brilliant smooth sand with a piece of driftwood . Her lips were moving ; she was talking to herself . The shouting up the beach was getting louder . In just a few moments , inevitably , Finny would hear or notice the excitement , and she would be frightened all over again , struck by the dangers inherent in being alive . Mariel wanted to run to her and cover her eyes with a soft cloth , carry her up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and buy her a dish of mango-flavored ice cream and offer to paint her nails . She started toward her . <p> But David materialized out of nowhere and took her hand . Without looking at him , she understood . Let Finny go . Let her see what we 're capable of : terror and rescue , all the evil and the good . Finny was turning around , the bright blue water a moving mirror at her feet . How can such a perfect place exist ? Mariel wondered . Let Finny find the answers . Let her step alone into the small compartment , cast a final glance back at her mother , and close the door . <p>
