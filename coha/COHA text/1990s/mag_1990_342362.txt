McArthur Towels in Baraboo , Wis. , thinks it has an answer to the controversy over female reporters in pro-football locker rooms . The company 's recommendation : a cover-up . McArthur , which supplies terry-cloth products to the National Football League , has begun donating some 2,000 wraps and robes for all the players on the league 's 28 teams . The robes and the kilt-like wraps , which are held around the waist with a Velcro closure , come in white or the team color . " They are handy , I suppose . They look nice , " said Cincinnati Bengals head coach Sam Wyche , who was fined by the N.F.L. last month after he denied a female reporter access to the team 's locker room . A problem has emerged , however : the one-size-fits-all wrap is n't big enough for five members of the Green Bay Packers in the 300-lb. range . McArthur plans to custom-make some wraps for them with a bit more room .                 @ @ @ @
