Chapter One Madison McCall checked her watch as she hurried down the long corridor on the main floor of her firm 's ornate offices . As usual , Madison wore clothes that were stylish , but that concealed her well-toned body . She did n't want to be regarded as just a body , or even a face , and she never had . Growing up , Madison was the girl who could have been the captain of the cheerleading team or Miss Texas . She never tried . When she was six years old she watched her father deliver a closing argument in a murder trial . Since that day , Madison knew she would be a lawyer . She was never smug about it , but as she grew up , other things just did n't matter as much as they seemed to matter to the rest of the girls her age . Even now-especially now-it was hard to not notice the gleam in her pretty green eyes which were perfectly spaced above high , shapely cheeks . Her nose was just long enough to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light brown hair was thick and soft , but she rarely let it down . Even with her hair up , Madison almost always drew a second look . At thirty-four , she was the youngest senior partner in her law firm . Her natural attractiveness , however , had nothing to do with her unusually rapid advancement . She had achieved that through her lawyering . Unfortunately , neither her looks nor her brains could help her now . She was late . " Hi , Dotty , I 'm running , " she said with a quick wave over her shoulder as she passed in and out of a large wood-paneled chamber that faced a bank of elevators . Dotty , the scowling receptionist , sat like a foreboding gargoyle at her claw-footed desk in the middle of a thick blue oriental rug . She was an old crab , but even she seemed unable to help herself from smiling when Madison bubbled by . Madison skidded to a stop on the marble floor in front of the wide double doors on her right . Absently , she brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bun and fallen into her face . She took a deep breath , pulled open one of the doors , and stepped inside . She expected to be confronted with the disapproving scowl of Dorian Baxter , the oldest and most powerful man in the firm and one of the most respected attorneys in the state of Texas . She was also prepared for painful silence from the rest of the firm 's partners as they looked on with pursed lips while Baxter berated her for being late . Instead , the six other partners on her firm 's executive committee were clustered about Dorian 's throne at the head of the conference table , standing anxiously like a handful of school-children waiting for the bell to ring . Instead of frowns , she was met with seven benevolent smiles . Madison would almost have preferred frowns . There was only one other woman in the room , Isabelle Denofrio , and her smile was the weakest of the bunch . Madison quickly reviewed her life over the past month , searching for the one thing that had gone drastically wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sprung . " Madison , good , " Dorian Baxter said in his thick sonorous voice . " We were just talking about you . " " I noticed , " Madison said . " That 's what I get for being late . " Baxter was a large man with swarthy skin and flowing white hair . He wore a charcoal suit with a conservative tie and a bright white shirt , a modern-day monarch . It was rumored he was close to eighty years old , but he could easily pass for a healthy sixty . His pale green eyes were piercing , and left people with the impression that nothing could be hidden from him . The rest of the partners scattered to their respective chairs , still smiling and nodding affably at Madison . She found her own seat and pulled a pen and a yellow legal pad out of her briefcase , setting them on the table in front of her before she looked back up at Dorian with the same winning innocent smile she used when addressing a jury . " As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clear his throat , " this year the firm has had some of the worst financial difficulties in its **33;93;TOOLONG history . " Madison wondered when he would get to the point . " We 're facing the unusual dilemma of having to look for places within the firm that we can cut , " he continued . This puzzled Madison more than worried her . Of course she did n't make as much money for the firm as some . Isabelle , who specialized in medical malpractice , could sometimes clear several million in a good year . As good as Madison was , the fact remained that criminals did n't typically have the resources to pay very big legal bills . Still , she had billed consistently for the past ten years and was careful to represent at least four paying customers for every indigent pro bono case she took on . She was easily worth her quarter-million-dollar salary . If anything , she had been expecting a raise . " In that respect , one area in this firm stands out . " Baxter held Madison 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know it 's difficult , still , for you to talk about Marty Cahn , " Baxter said , clearing his throat politely , " and I respect that . However , this firm has to move forward , and it has been over a year since his unfortunate death . " Madison was sure the entire room could hear her heart beating . Marty Cahn had been her best friend , a tax lawyer with whom she 'd gone through law school . His death had been sudden and violent , the result of his involvement in one of her murder trials . In fact , it was the trial of the man who was now Madison 's husband . Any mention of Marty 's name and death was loaded with emotion . " However , " Baxter 's voice boomed after a substantial pause , breaking Madison 's trance , " life goes on , and this firm goes on . It will after each of us has gone . And so , we would like you to seriously consider taking on one aspect of Marty 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm referring to Marty 's sports agency practice . " Madison 's eyes focused sharply . She looked around the room to see that every other partner was staring at her . " The fact is , Madison , " Baxter said , " Marty was bringing in substantial revenue from the work he did for NFL players alone . He brought in almost twice as much money in that area as he did in his tax work , no small accomplishment , and all while expending a tenth of the hours . Unfortunately , without Marty , this source of revenue has dried up . Marty seemed to have a knack for winning over these players . The associate who worked for him obviously lacks those skills . " We want you to take over the sports agency . And continue with your trial work , of course . " " No , " Madison said without hesitation , looking bravely at Dorian Baxter . " I 'm a trial lawyer . I 'm one of the best in my field , and that is exactly what I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sorry . " Baxter pursed his lips and nodded grimly . " I 'm sorry , too , " Baxter said coldly . He was not a man used to people saying no . " You see , we thought that with your marriage to Cody Grey and your affiliation with the NFL , and with the celebrity status that you 've acquired in the last year since your husband 's trial , well , we thought you could save some people 's jobs . " " I really have no affiliation with the NFL , Dorian , " Madison said as pleasantly as she could , " nor do I want to have . I do n't think I 'd be the person for that job . Is that all ? " " No , " Baxter said , pushing a folder toward her across the smooth rich grain of the mahogany conference table . " Since you are refusing the direct request of this committee , you will be the one to tell Chris Pelo that he no longer works here . " Madison started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and his voice at the same time . " Let me tell you , young lady , that you 're not the only talented trial lawyer I 've seen . This is n't about what you want to do and do n't want to do . This is about this firm and its well-being . You have the opportunity to help this firm in an hour of crisis ! " That you choose to take the path of self-service is a disappointment , " Baxter said , his voice becoming appropriately sad , " but as the managing partner , I will not take it upon myself to terminate a member of this firm when his position could have been preserved with some good old-fashioned teamwork . " " Fine , " Madison fumed , snatching the file from the table and rising to her feet . " But if you think that you can coerce me into taking on a specialty practice I have neither the background for nor interest in by making me do what is rightly your job , you 're wrong . Oh , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he works for such a cold-blooded bunch as we obviously are , measuring our attorneys in terms of dollars and cents instead of their competence and integrity . One bad year , and we 're already looking for who we can cut . Maybe he 'll be better off elsewhere . Maybe we all would be . " Madison stormed out of the conference room and hurried back to her office , where she shut the door so she could stew in private . She did n't want to say anything else she would regret . It was n't that Madison did n't think she was right . But , in a way , so was Baxter . Her firm did go beyond individual lawyers . The firm was an entity that had been there long before her , and would be there long after . Madison remembered when she was first offered a job with Caldburn , Baxter and Thrush . It was the biggest moment of her life . It was her dream come true . Her father was a respected trial attorney in Dallas , and she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make her own way , and she knew that in Austin there were opportunities , if she was smart enough and good enough to secure them . When she 'd first come to the firm out of law school , Timothy Pembrook , a lawyer whose skills even her father revered , had taken her under his wing , and by his death at the age of seventy-four , he had trained her to be one of the best . Neither Pembrook , nor her father , had served two masters . They were trial lawyers and nothing else . Therein lay the conflict . The man who had given her career life by making her his protege fresh out of law school was also the man whose focus was unwavering . Now she was faced with the choice of lending a hand to someone in need or maintaining the single-minded focus that had made her the best . " Why am I even thinking about this ? " she said out loud in a bewildered voice . " Nancy , " she said into her intercom . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him right away . " " Yes , Ms. McCall , " her secretary said . Madison opened the file on the desk in front of her . On top was a termination letter . She glanced through the terms : three months ' pay , one year of medical coverage for his entire family , prorated bonuses for this year . They were also letting him take the sports client list and the nontax files with him . It was all very fair , not something to be ashamed of . It was just business . When Pelo walked through the door , it was clear to her why the sports agency was foundering . She wondered for the hundredth time why Marty had ever attempted to cultivate this man as an NFL agent . Pelo was forty-three . He wore an ill-fitting gray suit and a red tie that was too short , with a knot that was too big . Madison suspected that he grew his bushy mustache to draw attention away from his badly pocked skin . His hair seemed bereft of any style whatsoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attribute he seemed to possess was a pair of deep-set eyes , bottomless black pools that focused with obvious intelligence . Madison knew that this guy was the last person ninety-nine point ninety-nine percent of all NFL players would even consider talking to about representing them . Agents in the NFL were a slick lot . Even Marty , with his angular frame and thick glasses , had cut an impressive figure because of his height alone . And Marty always knew how to put it on when he had to . He looked smart , and he was . Everyone around him sensed it . He knew how to dress and he knew how to order wine . Chris Pelo was the kind of guy who would have to prove he was smart , and NFL players did n't like to wait around for people to prove themselves . " Sit down , Chris , " Madison said after standing to shake his hand . " I 'm sorry I have to be the one to tell you this , " she said , preferring to get straight to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminate the sports agency , and , along with that , your position ... I 'm sorry . " Only the turmoil in Pelo 's eyes hinted at the agony he must be feeling . Outwardly , he was fine . Madison was impressed . She handed him the file . It was business , she told herself that again . " Is there anything I can do ? " Pelo said . " I mean , would they reconsider , in any way , do you think ? Could I work in another area ? The tax department ? Maybe even estate planning ? " Madison shook her head sadly . " I do n't think so , " she said . " They 're planning on cutting back everywhere they can , Chris . I have to tell you that they wanted me to run this agency with you , but it would n't work . It was a desperation thing with the executive committee . It would only have prolonged the inevitable for a few more months . I 'm not an agent . That 's why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punish me for not trying to become one . You know as well as anyone that it 's not a thing you can do if your heart 's not in it . " They both stared at the floor for a few moments before Pelo remembered himself and rose politely . " Thank you , Madison , " he said , extending his hand . " Huh ? " she said , caught off guard . " No , " he explained , holding up the letter , " not for this . I mean just thanks for treating me the way you did . I know the only reason I was in this firm was because of Marty . He was eccentric , let 's face it . I 'm a Mexican , middle-aged ex-cop trying to be a big-time sports agent . " Pelo let out a good-natured chuckle in honor of his old boss . " But you were probably the only other person in this firm who treated me like I belonged here . You never acted uncomfortable when I passed you in the hall or met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just another lawyer . I appreciate that . Goodbye . " Madison almost stopped him as he passed quickly through her doorway . But then he was gone , and after a heavy sigh and a moment of thought , she lifted a thick trial file marked fears from her drawer and began to read through it . ( Continues ... )
