High prices are as much an institution in Western Europe as the Changing of the Guard , but this summer the weakness of American currency stunned even veteran trans-Atlantic travelers . The dollar has bulked up a bit over the past few weeks , but a buck still wo n't go far in Harrod 's or on the Champs-Elysees . A dollar now buys .64 of a pound ( versus .50 this summer ) , 5.4 francs ( versus a summer low of 4.7 ) and 1,350 lire ( up from 1,070 ) . <p> Nonetheless , an off-season trip to the Continent does not have to lead to Chapter 11 .
