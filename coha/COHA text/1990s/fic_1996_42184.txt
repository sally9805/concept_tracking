WHEN MICHAEL MALLORY planned their trip to Honduras , getting his brand-new stepson kidnapped by panhandling guerrillas did not figure in his calculations . In the years that followed Mallory 's Peace Corps tour , the dirt-poor little country had grown greener in his recollection , hallowed by its unequal struggle . The hills he remembered hiking were inhabited by forbearing , folk-wise farmers who wore their yoke of poverty with muscular grace . In the north-coast valleys , expatriate overlords made sure that brown backs stayed bent through generations of the production cycle that put world-class bananas on gringo breakfast tables for pennies . Then in the ' 80s came the Contra , like one big mercenary turd shat from the bowels of the Reagan Administration to befoul the pleasant , put-upon land . Even then , under that load of waste , Honduras kept smiling green . Then , in Tegucigalpa , Derrick took <p> walk around the block and did n't come back . <p> You could n't blame Rebecca for freezing up . Back in Nebraska , Mallory had built up for her an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been married just eight months . They dragged along her fifteen-year-old son , so you could n't call it a honeymoon postponed . But Rebecca was eager to see for herself the place where Mallory had lived his personal golden age . Then what she saw made her freeze . <p> At first they figured Derrick was staying away just to dramatize his discontent . Rebecca had divorced when the boy was a baby , he had grown up wounded by the absence of a father , and Mallory was more trespasser than substitute . Derrick knew how to sulk . Bony-thin and too tall for his build , he sweated in the Honduran heat and grew pimples that were like greasy badges of his suffering . The boy had invented his own mythical past : inside his expensive headphones the Fugs , the Troggs , and the Mothers of Invention replayed revolutionary music that might still change the world . How many fifteen-year-olds across the USA had even heard of the Velvet Underground ? The music , Derrick had let Mallory know once in a conversation occluded with metaphors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was his identity , which quivered like light . He disappeared without taking his Walkman , which should have made them suspicious right away . <p> When Lenin Ramirez came to the hotel to deliver the message with the guerrillas ' demands , Mallory realized his mistake . In the course of the interview for Radio Testigo  --  the human rights activist 's shield and cause and life 's project  --  Mallory had mentioned casually that he was enjoying the Quixote , the same low-budget hotel he had stayed in as a volunteer years before . <p> " They 're desperate , Miguelito , " Ramirez explained . They were speaking in Spanish in the Quixote 's cafeteria , which kept Rebecca out of the conversation , giving Mallory time to think how he would tell her . " They are desperate because they are flat broke . It 's the first time they have done anything that involved a child . " <p> Lenin Ramirez was an engine , a force of nature , a wind that blew down trees . Something like six foot five , as flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1967 in Bolivia with Che Guevara , the man still exploded when the wire of his righteous indignation was tripped . A teetotaling ascetic , he had taken on a generation of military antagonists for whom the defense of civil liberties equaled the appeasement of world communism . The story went that Ramirez , a revolutionary at eighteen , only missed getting blown away with Che when a Bolivian contact forgot to pass him a message about where to meet . When he returned to Honduras in the mid- ' 70s , Radio Testigo became the vehicle his big V-8 engine of outrage powered . <p> Once , when he was a volunteer in Santa Barbara , Mallory had seen men in uniform drive off in a truck with a campesino known for his loud-mouthed rhetoric on land reform , which had become bogged down in a bureaucracy of vested interests . He contacted Lenin Ramirez to denounce the abduction , and something like a friendship developed . Ramirez had been the one Honduran to whom Mallory wrote consistently in the intervening years , sending him , when he could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the most logical thing in the world for Ramirez to interview Mallory . The American had kept up his Spanish . And he experienced a gratifying sense of connection while describing his research on land-tenure patterns in the Andes to Hondurans of good faith tuned in to Witness Radio . It was in the chatty moments after the interview proper that he mentioned staying at the Quixote . <p> " Tell him Derrick ca n't speak a word of Spanish , " Rebecca instructed Mallory . She sat by his side in a cafeteria booth of peeling red leather , rigid with her premonitions . Hands clasped resolutely around a sugar bowl , Ramirez faced them both in an attitude of pained calm . Even under stress Rebecca was collected , attractive in a way that made Mallory marvel at his luck . She never seemed to sweat . Compact , pale-complexioned , she looked like what she was : the young college professor every male student dreamed of conquering . Her layered black hair had its own style , one Mallory had never seen on anyone else . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormity of his guilt overwhelmed him . <p> " They must have been surveilling you , and they saw that the boy was with you , " Lenin thought aloud , looking into Rebecca 's face as he spoke . She nodded gravely before Mallory translated . <p> " Tell him we will cooperate entirely with the people who have Derrick , " Rebecca told her husband , addressing Ramirez . Mallory heard her exhale quietly , letting the air go guardedly , a distress signal only he could detect . He translated . Lenin nodded respectfully , as though a studied civility was just the thing to keep them all from panic . <p> " The thing is this , " Lenin explained . " They want half a million dollars . " <p> " That 's absurd , " Mallory protested . " We 're college professors . We do n't have that kind of money . You know we do n't . " <p> " What 's he saying , Michael ? " <p> " The other thing they said was not to get in touch with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did they threaten ? " <p> " Please , Michael , I need to know what Lenin is saying . " <p> " If you contact either , they said , they will kill the boy . " <p> " Of course we wo n't contact them , " Rebecca said when she heard . The message they agreed to send back through Lenin was a promise not to go to the police , and to wire down as much money as they could . Ramirez agreed that a good-faith attempt to cooperate would buy time . Mallory made the necessary calls back to the States from their room . Then he and Rebecca stripped and lay on their backs in bed under a grating ceiling fan that cooled the sweat on their skin teasingly . Mallory explained how the guerrillas had learned where to surveil . <p> " It 's not your fault , " Rebecca reassured him . He listened for the echoes in her voice that would tell the truth , that it was his fault , that he had brought them to a Honduras he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the controlled terror for which , he knew , he was entirely responsible . <p> " I think we ought to call the embassy , " Mallory told her . " This is their job , this is what they 're here for . " <p> " What if the guerrillas have our telephone tapped Then they 'll kill Derrick . " She shook her head back and forth on her pillow , emphatically . <p> " They do n't have the technology to tap phones , Rebecca . " <p> " How do you know that ? Can you guarantee me the phone is n't tapped ? " <p> Perversely , the combination of her helplessness and his guilt aroused him , but he was afraid to touch her , no matter how tentatively . Having lost Derrick , he had forfeited any privilege of consolation . For a moment she stared at his erection but said nothing . In the stagnant heat he quickly wilted . Instead , Mallory tried to put in unalarming order for Rebecca some of what Lenin had told him when she left them alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small group of guerrillas who had splintered in the ' 80s from the revolutionary shaft . The Unified Revolutionary Strike Force ( FAUR ) was ideologically unbending , rhetorically shrill , and uncompromising in its indictment of global imperialism . Through the wavy glass of their political prism even Ramirez came out looking like a bourgeois collaborator ; they condescended to talk to him only to oblige him to pass their ransom demand to Mallory . <p> Because it came down to that : money . When the East Bloc empire went belly-up , the money that had kept the FAUR tenuously alive dried to a trickle and then evaporated altogether . A campaign of fund-raising expeditions to anti-imperialist governments netted them zip . Then a bank robbery they planned went bad ; perhaps they had been infiltrated by military intelligence . In any event , the police ambushed and executed every mother 's son in the sizable squad sent to knock over a bank chosen carefully for its imperialist affiliation . The FAUR was demoralized . Then an enterprising militante caught Mallory 's radio interview and came up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they waited , Mallory watched Rebecca ice . It was not quite like denial ; the fear was too fresh , too raw . More like a strategic retreat into a cave from inside which she could keep her eye on the entrance , hold danger at bay . He wanted to get through to her but realized just how new they still were to one another . Eight months was nothing . <p> The morning after Derrick disappeared , Mallory and Rebecca sent word through Ramirez that they had ten thousand dollars in cash to trade for the boy , no questions asked . It took only two hours for their offer to be turned down . Ramirez came to their room dour and tense and , Mallory saw , profoundly embarrassed by what the FAUR was doing . <p> " I tried to make them understand that you are not rich people , " he apologized , " but they seem to have lost the ability to reason . Or that is their pose , I do n't know . Perhaps you should get in touch with your embassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped reflexively from the mouth of her cold cave . <p> " Tell them , " Mallory said slowly , his emotions flattening out as he spoke into an imitation of calm , " that I will make a trade . " <p> " What trade , Miguelito " <p> " Me for Derrick . " <p> Mallory could not interpret the little noise Rebecca made ; it was not quite a word . <p> " They might buy that , " Ramirez nodded , squaring his shoulders as if the idea really meant a happy way out . " It would be more respectable for them to hold an adult . " <p> The wait for the guerrillas ' answer was intolerable . June was high rainy season . At dusk the city bowed its head and took on the shoulders a rainstorm that fell like an undeserved beating for a full hour . <p> " All my thoughts are small and simple , " Rebecca said once when the rain ebbed . Absently she had picked up a textbook , though she did not open it . Mallory understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for what she knew . She was , above all things , a teacher . Her thesis on comparative cartography had been published , then gone to paperback . Maps and Empire got Rebecca early tenure and the academic momentum for her pet project , the development of a globe that put the northern hemisphere on the bottom . The point , she believed , was best made visibly . " I want him back , and I 'm afraid , and I feel very small . That 's the size of the universe now . " <p> " I 'm going to make an effort to get through to Derrick , " Mallory told her . " When this is all over , I mean . I just need to come up with a new way to try . " <p> She nodded , as if what he had said were the reasoned conclusion to a conversation in which both had communicated expertly , clear as church bells . <p> At midnight when he explained the counteroffer Ramirez was careful to offer no advice . The guerrillas would turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars . <p> " If they have you , but they think they can not get any more money out of us , they might be tempted to kill you , " Rebecca thought aloud . Ramirez understood enough English to nod . <p> " What options do we have ? " Having constantly to translate permitted Mallory to feel temporarily removed from the problem of getting Derrick back . He felt no stir of selflessness or courage , just a nagging , dull desire to know nothing , to be past the nightmare . <p> Rebecca sat straight-backed on the bed , Mallory and Ramirez in rickety-legged chairs on either side of her . The big Honduran folded his arms violently across his chest and slumped . <p> " You could still try your embassy , " he offered . <p> But Rebecca shook her head stiffly even before the translation . " Tell them we accept , " Mallory said in Spanish , " but we have to agree on how to make the trade . I have to know Derrick is free . " <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you knew I was going to accept their offer .... " Had that been strictly loyal on Lenin 's part Mallory felt his ability to judge impaired ; he was n't thinking in a straight line . Ramirez shrugged to remind him they had no options . <p> The FAUR insisted the trade be made at night , which meant another full day of waiting . Rebecca tried to stay close , but talking did n't work . Mallory could not abide her hope . She wanted to make love , but the most he could manage was to smother a self-indulgent comment about fucking a corpse . At nightfall he asked her not to go down with him to the grimy lobby where Ramirez waited . <p> " There 's no conceivable gain for them to kill me , Rebecca . From their point of view all that will do is bring down the wrath of the CIA . " <p> She kissed him like Hollywood ; all the way down the gritty stairs he sloshed her saliva around in his mouth . Everything bad that happened or that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fault . <p> Ramirez 's car was suitably anonymous , a beat-up Toyota compact that looked like five thousand others on the streets . The founder of Radio Testigo drove as sloppily as a taxista away from the grid of colonial-era streets toward Colonia Kennedy , the kind of sprawling , faceless neighborhood in which anyone who tried could become invisible . <p> " It 's simple , " Ramirez explained as they went . " You walk in , Derrick walks out and gets in the car . I turn over the money after Derrick is back in the hotel . " <p> " And they bought that ? They 're not afraid we 'll set them up ? " <p> " They bought an insurance policy . " <p> " You ... " <p> " Supposedly one of the muchachos is standing by at the radio with explosives . If the exchange falls apart he blows the station . " <p> " And everyone will blame the military . Cute , Lenin . They 're bastards , are n't they ? " <p> " Listen , Miguel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There may be elements in the FAUR who are not quite irrational . " <p> On a street Mallory knew he could n't find a second time , Ramirez parked in front of a pleasant stucco house fronted by unkempt flowering bushes whose branches cast exquisite , trembling shadows in the soft-edged white light from a corner streetlight . Somewhere down the street a Mexican ranchera played plaintively : De que manera te olvido ? It was a night that called for a moon , but none to be had . After just a few minutes a light in the front window of the pleasant house went on , then off again . <p> " That 's it , " Ramirez told him . " Go on in . Do n't worry . They need the money so bad they 'll be happy to let Derrick go . " <p> Mallory realized then the absolute poverty of his imagination . He had n't known how scared he would feel , how difficult it would be to walk in and surrender himself to hungry , radical guerrillas for whom the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable world . Later he wished he had been able to come up with a dignified way to part from Ramirez , some sane and pithy coda to illuminate the moment , which might have had its music . As it was he simply walked toward the little house like a man who might change his mind . <p> Inside the unlit foyer he was grasped , grabbed , a sweaty hand held over his mouth . He gagged , then followed whoever led into a back room that might have been a kitchen . Surrounded by men who looked like taxi drivers or lottery ticket salesmen or out-of-work housepainters , Derrick sat at the table , sullen as ever , hands bound for symbolic effect . Seeing Mallory was like a revelation . Mallory figured no one had spoken enough English even to let the boy know his release was being negotiated . <p> " Michael " His voice cracked like a choirboy 's , and Mallory saw something fine and alive in his face , a new intelligence that his conditioned sulk could not conceal . Being kidnapped had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a story at least , and  --  better still  --  a new perspective from which to meditate on the Fugs ' version of revolution . One of the lottery ticket salesmen untied the boy 's hands while the rest watched , wooden conspirators in a dull plot . <p> " There 's a Toyota parked in front of the house , Derrick . The man inside is named Lenin Ramirez . Lenin 's a friend . He 'll drive you back to your mother at the hotel . It 's OK . " <p> " What about you , Michael ? " Mallory was pleased as a father at the boy 's brash new intelligence . He had figured out the deal . <p> " I 'll join you later . I have some details to work out with these people . " <p> Derrick was permitted to stand . He nodded soberly , massaging his hands , and Mallory saw that he might in fact have come to appreciate Rebecca 's son . Over time . He too had once thought blows against the empire would bring it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its magic was only temporary . Derrick was pushed out of the kitchen , down the dark hall , and Mallory heard the door open , then close again quietly , a domestic sound that reminded Mallory he was not at home . <p> None of his captors wanted to talk . They gestured for Mallory to sit in Derrick 's chair . He sat . Stupid to resist as they bound his hands , his feet , and put a greasy gag in his mouth . Someone knocked him on the skull once , but he was conscious when they put a burlap bag over his head and lifted him like soft-sided luggage . Did air penetrate burlap ? It must . The fear was still there but dissipated , as though some noxious substance were invading the innocent cells of his abused body . But there was room as well for a kind of rocking lassitude , a passivity he could almost enjoy . When they carried him outside he knew it was the trunk of a car into which they dumped him . Inside he smelled oil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carcass of a dead animal . He knew before the engine turned over that they were going to leave the city . He knew that when they did talk , they would not be discussing land-tenure patterns in the Andes . He knew there was no more idyll . <p> Mallory figured 007 was due to show up from the vehemence with which Comandante Flechita slashed his stick at the high grass on the margin of the yard . The menace that 007 tossed off went in all directions , could land anywhere , even on the blameless muchacho assigned to guard the golden gringo . At the conclusion of the rebel leader 's first visit to the hideout , Mallory had observed 007 smack the younger man 's face with the flat of one horny hand , hard enough to humiliate . That 's for nothin ' ; now go do somethin ' . <p> " You going to let him hit you this time ? " Mallory called from in front of the mud-walled shack to which the guerrillas had marched him the week before . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thought about smiling . Decided he would not . Flechita was squat , pale-skinned as a Spanish princess but with the face of an adolescent rhinoceros , minus the horn . His eyes were always disappearing in pouchy slabs of skin . He had grown up on the north coast on a banana plantation . The company-funded school taught him how to read , but his first lover 's brother  --  a political scientist who had studied in Mexico  --  taught him what . Flechita was serious and smart . What he read in the big book of injustice led him inexorably into action . Which did n't mean he had to like getting knocked around by 007 . He bent his broad rhino face and attacked the wet grass again . <p> Past where Flechita flailed , the stony ground sloped away to pinewoods that grew denser in the distance , hiding the view of saber-toothed rainy-season clouds filing the tops of green mountains that Mallory knew must be there . The FAUR knew how to pick a hideout . In a week not a single errant campesino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led . Just Mallory and his guard . Just storm wind impaling itself on pine-tree spikes , and the musical angst of nervous birds , and the secret slitherings of animals that would never let themselves be seen and shot . Mallory had plenty of time to look around and absorb the anonymous acre in Honduras on which his life had been cut in half , plenty of time to think of all the things he might never be able to say to Rebecca . He had been robbed ; he was angry . <p> Despite the bond between captor and capturado , despite the unending hours of politically intimate conversation that Mallory nurtured , Flechita was careful not to untie the ropes binding the gringo 's hands and feet unless the Honduran had a gun trained on him . Urinating under the scrutiny of a semiautomatic rifle continued to distress Mallory ; he felt defiled . Important not to let predictable emotional reactions get in the way of his plan . Turning Flechita was his only option . He waited for the Honduran to thrash away his own case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beans and every other day some gristly beef . Flechita loosened the rope on Mallory 's hands , and they ate companionably in the yard , listening to the wind express itself . Mallory folded a tortilla around a hunk of mashed beans that needed salt ; his mouth watered of its own volition . " I just want to get your logic down straight , Flechita . If I 'm going to die you owe me that much . " <p> " Who said you 're going to die ? " The Honduran chewed as though his food were sour and he could scarcely keep it down . <p> " Do me the courtesy of not lying , anyway . It 's bad manners to lie to a condemned man . In my country before they execute you they give you a cheeseburger , some french fries , and a chocolate milkshake . It 's the law . " <p> " Here it 's just beans . " The disappearing eyes smiled slyly . <p> " So the logic of the FAUR is , you are holding me personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad old days . " <p> Flechita shook his head ponderously . " The FAUR needs money to keep going . We ca n't let money be the reason we give up the struggle . You represent money . " <p> " And if my people ca n't come up with any ? My father drove a taxi , and he 's dead . My mother washed dishes in a nursing home . Where 's the money ? " <p> Flechita looked behind him as if to spy out the money ; what he was looking for , Mallory realized late , was 007 . Better not to be surprised talking familiarly with the gringo . A few nuggets of cold rain thunked , and Mallory shivered . <p> " What I really want to know , Flechita , is whether you as a person , apart from the FAUR , can accept the idea of killing me . " <p> " There 's such a thing as discipline , Mallory . " <p> " Yes , and such a thing as individual conscience , as making up your own mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a chink there to be hacked at . What he needed was time to hack , but 007 , when he came , left him thinking there would be too little to accomplish anything . <p> 007 might have been fifty . Handsome as a poet , with gray eyes that ambushed and a super-short gray beard , he had been one of the renegades who founded the FAUR . There was no road to the hideout ; he and three housepainters with expensive rifles and cheap machetes came walking up through the damp woods like tourists who had lost their way . Head down , Flechita heated coffee on the small fire he stirred . <p> " Ramirez says your people are unable to raise more money , " the guerrilla leader told Mallory . " Maybe they do n't love you . " <p> " Not all gringos are rich . You must have known that . " <p> 007 shrugged , and Mallory wondered how far the man could be pushed before he blew up and smacked him . He assumed the FAUR 's James Bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There is one other option . We are informing the American embassy that we have you , and that we will turn you over for $200,000 . " <p> " The embassy wo n't deal . It 's government policy . " <p> " They dealt with Iran and the Ayatollah . " <p> " That was a mistake . " <p> " The hypocrisy of the American government exceeds belief . They 'll pay . Your congressman will write to the president . They 'll show your picture on television . You can go home and write a book and get rich . " <p> " It wo n't work . " Why was it so important to keep on making the point , when making it might get him killed ? Mallory had a bad moment , thinking that one of the other FAUR militantes was going to trade places with Flechita . But 007 abruptly walked away , escorted by the same contingent he came with . The guerrilla leader appeared relaxed and hopeful , as if he was sure the U.S. government would cough up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He left without hitting Flechita , who celebrated by letting Mallory go for a walk in the woods , hands tied behind his back . The guard trailed with his gun , safety off . <p> That night , letting himself be trussed on his shuck mattress like a chicken going to market , Mallory asked Flechita , " You know my government is n't going to pay a nickel to free me , do n't you ? " <p> Flechita straightened the rope tight around Mallory 's feet and nodded . " I know they wo n't . " <p> " Does the idea of my getting killed when 007 figures that out bother you ? " <p> " There 's such a thing ... " Flechita began , warding him off , but he did not complete the sentence . He blew out the lone candle that lit their shack and fell heavily onto his own shuck mattress . <p> Mallory had been sleeping deeply and easily in the shack despite being tied , as if constraint was a good thing . He lay listening to Flechita lapse into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream , the images clots in a sluggish river of dumb thought . <p> The rain that had been hoarded all day woke him when it finally came . Flechita was breathing more quietly , hard to hear over the wet wind in the rain-battered woods . Listening , Mallory tried to visualize Rebecca 's face , her body , to conjure up her smell , but all he could grab was an opaque fantasy . Eight months was nothing . He felt cheated , but he was the one who had done the cheating : he had lied to Rebecca , invented a country and a state of innocence , neither of which existed . It made no difference that he had believed they did . He resisted the urge to masturbate , to get Rebecca back in that unsatisfying way . <p> He was suddenly dizzy . He wanted to sit up , walk around in the storm , think mobile . But his tied legs had cramped to sleep , and he felt a burning urge to urinate . Some perversion of pride kept him from waking Flechita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was happening to him . The main thing , he told himself as if it were a pearl of insight , was that he did n't want to die . <p> Clutching the pearl , he eventually slept . In the morning Flechita let him walk a solid hour through the sodden woods , far enough this time to see unimpeded the view of green mountains he had known must be there . Mallory 's eyes were hungry . Both men watched the gray sky break up into patchy blue . Hands tied loosely , Mallory sat on an outcropping of gritty-surfaced rock . Flechita crouched a few feet away , rifle in his lap . <p> " I do n't want to die , " Mallory said . <p> " Maybe we 're both wrong , Mallory , and your government will ransom you . " <p> " Tell me something , amigo , do you really think 007 is going to let me go , even if he gets money from somewhere ? " <p> No comment from the FAUR . <p> Mallory spent the next week hacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Six days more , seven , eight . Hacking required delicacy , finesse , a sense of timing . Too much at the wrong moment , Mallory told himself , and his captor would seal up entirely . But he had nothing else to do with his time than be careful , be persistent . He was both , and he saw progress . Once , after coffee , Flechita came close to admitting that there might be a logical flaw in holding a middle-class academic as a pawn in the greater game of national liberation the FAUR was playing . What Mallory needed was more time . <p> The bad thing was losing track of days . When he realized he was slipping , Mallory made a pile of sticks , one for each day held . So he was pretty sure it was on the seventeenth day of his captivity that three FAUR militantes appeared in the woods below the shack . This time 007 did not accompany them . They called out Flechita , who came back after half an hour swinging absently at the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to do it yourself , Flechita ? " <p> " Your embassy sent a message that they do not negotiate with terrorists . That made 007 furious . The FAUR rejects the concept of being lumped in with common criminals . We are revolutionary guerrillas engaged in a war of national liberation , not terrorists . " <p> " Did they tell you to shoot me ? " <p> " 007 is working through your friend Ramirez . There is one more counteroffer to be made to the gringos . " <p> " How much time do I have to live ? " <p> Flechita raised the machete in irritation , and Mallory thought he had made his first mistake of timing . But the rhinoceros-faced little man turned suddenly and left . Mallory watched him pace the perimeter of the yard for a long time , a parody of guard duty . The tall grass in his path suffered . <p> That night Mallory drilled at the guerrilla as they lay on their mattresses , which had collected moisture and stank of rot . Mallory 's nostrils collected dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes burned . " I do n't want to die , " he reminded Fletchita in the slippery dark . " It 's not right , it 's not correct or logical or necessary , and you know it . " <p> " Shut up and sleep , " Flechita growled , and spat on the dirt floor . <p> The FAUR people had brought supplies along with their ultimatum , so in the morning there was coffee with sugar , and eggs fried in oil , to go with the tortillas and beans . And salt for everything . Mallory 's Pavlov tongue salivated . He could feel the grease scouring his system and was afraid he would have serious diarrhea . It occurred to him that his and Rebecca 's money had paid for the food they were eating , which made it taste better . But his helplessness shamed him , as though it were his fault , a grievous character flaw . <p> " OK , " Flechita told him when they had finished washing the dishes in a plastic bucket of cold creek water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do it ? " Mallory said . <p> " It has to look like you surprised me . Otherwise they 'll kill me . They 're coming back for you tomorrow either way . I did n't tell you that . " <p> " I 'll leave you tied up . " " You can do that . But you 'll have to hit me once , hard enough to leave a mark they 'll believe . " <p> They spent the morning discussing the details . Conspiracy heightened the camaraderie that had been building , abetted by Mallory , resisted by the guerrilla . The American disciplined himself not to show his elation , not to offer any premature and enthusiastic thanks . <p> After lunch Mallory had a hard time waiting patiently . He needed the hours of light to put some distance between him and the hideout . Finally he had to say it : " Flechita , can we do it now ? " <p> The aggrieved look the guerrilla gave him distanced them from each other in an instant , giving them what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The afternoon sun was cheerful ; birds swooped and babbled brainlessly in the crisp , unfiltered light . Mallory lifted his hands , and Flechita untied them with exaggerated deliberation . He let Mallory free his own feet , watching him from a distance with his rifle cradled . <p> Free , Mallory walked haltingly around the yard a few times . " Someday when you 're dying , " he called to his captor , who watched him grumpily , " you 'll know you did the right thing . " <p> Their revised idea was to score the Honduran 's cheek with a knife blade , gently , just enough to draw blood and leave a mark . Then Mallory would tie him comfortably to the mattress , take the rifle , and disappear . Flechita would have all night to devise a credible story . When Mallory had his legs under control he went to stand ceremonially at the doused cookfire , on the other side of which Flechita observed him with more apprehension than Mallory thought healthy . <p> Flechita handed him the knife , blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face he did n't , could n't . " You 're responsible , goddamn it , " he yelled at Mallory in the voice of a man unbalanced , and Mallory wondered for what . The whole thing was quickly slipping away . No choice : he surprised the guerrilla , leaped the dead fire and bowled into him hard . They both fell , and Mallory drove his knee into Flechita 's groin . The shot of pain loosened the Honduran 's grip on the rifle , and Mallory yanked it from him . <p> The part that shaped things for Mallory was the pleasure he took in hurting the man he had own to like . He had the advantage ; he used it . Flechita was on his back , stunned , slow to recover . So Mallory clubbed him with the butt of the rifle . In the chest , hard as he could bring it down . Twice . In the face , once . The Honduran lost consciousness , bled a red line from his twisted mouth . And Mallory was as happy as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guerrilla with the same sweaty ropes that had been used on him so many times they felt like old clothes . He trussed Flechita as tightly as he had himself been trussed . But rather than dragging him inside the shack to a mattress , he left him in the yard . He slugged down a cup of cold coffee , took the rifle , and walked instinctively downhill . <p> He knew nobody from the FAUR was going to get him again . But he moved carefully , like one of the Honduran animals he never saw , and eventually he came to a dirt road . He tossed the rifle into underbrush , then took the road until it dead-ended in a T at a slightly wider dirt road . It was almost dark , and he was beat , so he found a nook and slept peacefully in the uninhabited underbrush at the head of the lonesome T. He made Tegucigalpa , on a misfiring recycled Bluebird school bus , late the next afternoon . He was still inexcusably happy . <p> Walking around Tegucigalpa was like waking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The noise of human traffic soothed and stimulated him . The sight of a woman in a shiny blue dress dragging a grinning child along a broken sidewalk made him want to praise and cry . The smells in the market , things frying and festering , made him salivate . He went not to the Quixote but to Lenin 's radio station , where the activist wrapped him in his enormous , enfolding arms and roared . " Rebecca is staying with us , " he told Mallory . " She sent the boy back to Nebraska . Let 's go , I 'll drive you home . You married yourself a good one , Miguelito . She told me she would wait for you until she saw the body . Dead or alive . You beat the FAUR , hijo de puta , you beat the FAUR " <p> Held passive , slumped against his friend 's treelike body , Mallory finally finished waking up . <p> In September at a Stop-N-Shop in Lincoln , in the bright fluorescence of plasticized plenty , Mallory began to cry . Rebecca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the aisle to get a loaf of whole wheat bread and some French mustard . Derrick , who had not wanted to come shopping with them in the first place , watched the tears run down Mallory 's face with an expression of helpless sympathy , watched his hands grip the handle of the cart until the knuckles whitened . But proximity to an out-of-control adult embarrassed him , and he backed away , playing nervously with the volume on his Walkman . <p> While Mallory cried , two or three people pushed their own carts safely past him , casual voyeurs fascinated at a display of emotion that just might be genuine , just might have reason to be . Then Rebecca was back . " I 'm sorry , Michael . I 'm sorry for you . I think I know , a little , what Honduras meant to you . " <p> He shook his head . His eyes burned , his nose was congested . She took his hand and caressed it while a bald man with a trim beard and catlike green eyes minced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's not what you think , Rebecca . " <p> " Then what is it ? " <p> " It 's Flechita . " <p> " What about him ? " <p> " I wanted to kill him . " <p> She stopped rubbing his hand , and he felt her suspended next to him , listening to something he might not be able to hear himself . On a far periphery Derrick hovered , fretting . <p> " I really wanted to kill him , " he told her again . Because that 's what it came down to , when it came down to anything . And it did . There was a hole inside . It would not be filled now . " Did we get everything on the list ? " he asked Rebecca . She said something that might have meant it did n't matter , and he wheeled the cart toward the checkout . That was what it came down to , he was thinking . At the counter , when it was their turn , he stacked their groceries on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chirpy . Out of her orange-lipsticked mouth came little barks of welcome and pretended pleasure . The thing was , he remembered with fresh intensity , he had wanted to kill Flechita . <p>
