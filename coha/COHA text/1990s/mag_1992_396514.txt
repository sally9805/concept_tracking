The first anyone in Bogata , Texas ( pop . 1,421 ) , knew that there might be a problem at tiny Rivercrest High School was last October . Dona Kay Spence , a local health care worker , was quoted by the nearby Mount Pleasant Daily Tribune as saying she was counseling six Rivercrest students who had tested HIV positive . The school board , upset that it had n't been told first , summoned Spence to a closed meeting just before Christmas . She would not break federal and state laws by releasing the names of the students , she told them , nor would she discuss the delicate question of how the teens had contracted the virus . AIDS had found a new population of victims , she said . It was n't just homosexuals , prostitutes and drug addicts in the big cities who were being infected . Now rural kids were at risk as well . Not until Valentine 's Day did Spence 's disclosure reach the attention of the national media . Yet when it did , it sparked nervous concern across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school , their children . But how true is Dona Spence 's alarming report ? Is it really possible that a tiny rural high school in the northeast corner of Texas could have an HIV rate six times higher than the national average ? The answer is not clear . Although Spence , 40 , swears she has seen what she calls " proof " that the six cases exist , some people suspect she may be exaggerating the case to win grants for a new AIDS center she is opening in Mount Pleasant . She has made several inconsistent statements about the situation . Furthermore , PEOPLE has learned , she seems to have concocted important parts of her resume . Spence 's findings are now being reviewed by the Texas Department of Health , and she is under investigation by the U.S. Attorney 's district office in Beaumont . But officials are still not dismissing her claims altogether . " We have no doubts that HIV infection exists among the high school age group in Texas , " says Doug McBride of the state health department . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credibility . " Spence , an " AIDS/HIV case manager " for a nonprofit social services organization , says the six Rivercrest cases are just the beginning . She claims she is privately counseling : a total of 36 HIV positive teenagers from the area . All 36 brought their test results to her , she says , and she then verified the results with their testing agencies . None of the cases included drugs , she says , and only two were the result of homosexual activity . Instead she blames rampant teenage heterosexual sex . " We knew we had sexually active college kids , but all this business on the high school level will surprise some people . It should n't . " Reaction to Spence 's allegations among the cotton farms and cattle ranches around Bogata was immediate . At two boys varsity basketball games in February , some of the visiting players declined to participate . Two other schools refused to allow their junior varsity teams to play the Rivercrest Rebels at all . And when the Rebels girls basketball team took the floor at Chisum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chanted , " HIV ! HIV ! HIV ! " Says Rivercrest senior Patches Raines , 17 : " They would n't even shake hands with us because they said we were all infected with AIDS . " Until the controversy , AIDS education in Rivercrest consisted mainly of encouraging abstinence . But now the school is showing films and distributing pamphlets on the subject . " I handed out literature so the faculty could become familiar with it , " says Rivercrest Principal Ray Miller . " I told them , " Tell it like it is , because they need to know this . ' Hopefully the kids will use more caution . " So far , I though , teens are not buying condoms  --  at least not locally . " I have n't sold a condom in a week , " says Bogata 's lone pharmacist , Bill Buckman . Many people in the area have their doubts about Dona Spence . They wonder why the identities of the six students are not generally known in a town where gossip moves at the speed of light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something today , and tomorrow everyone knows , " says Shelia Burns , who has two kids in Rivercrest . More troubling to school officials is the lack of independent confirmation that the 36 HIV cases exist . " It all comes back to one person  --  Dona Spence , " Miller says . " The town and general public are not 100 percent convinced in their minds that the information is 100 percent accurate . " Suspicious school officials in nearby towns point to the AIDS center that Spence is planning to open on her own April 1 . If the area is perceived to have a high incidence of AIDS , they argue , it would be easier for her to obtain public or private funding . U.S. Attorney Bob Wortham of Beaumont is also concerned about this point . He launched an investigation last week to see if Spence falsified any data when applying for state or federal funds . Spence has also made statements damaging to her own credibility . For example , she originally stated there were four HIV-positive students at Mount Pleasant High School and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , she says , the youths in those areas are only " school age " ; she does n't know if they attend school or not . And The Dallas Morning News reports that she initially said the HIV cases were discovered when the teens donated blood . She has since changed that explanation , the paper says , contending that they were tested privately in such cities as Dallas , Texarkana Or Shreveport , places where they could be assured of anonymity . But her most glaring inconsistencies deal with her resume . Initially , Spence told PEOPLE that she obtained a nursing degree from the City College of San Francisco before entering the Air Force in 1972 as a nurse . Indeed , an advertisement in a local newspaper listed her as a registered nurse . She also claimed that she transferred to the Army , achieved the rank of captain and served two Vietnam tours at a military hospital  --  she could not remember the name  --  in Saigon . While there , she claimed , she won a Purple Heart for catching a piece of shrapnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside while I was helping with a gurney . " She added that her military background can not be verified , since her service records were destroyed in a fire at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis . Official records do not support her claims . The Air Force says she served as an airman , not a nurse , for five months in the early ' ' 70s . City College of San Francisco records show she attended classes for one year but never received a degree . The Army Personnel Center in St. Louis says she enlisted in Oakland in 1981 and was on duty for only 11 months , achieving the rank of private first class . She was not an Army nurse , records show , but rather a " medical laboratory specialist . " She was stationed at Fort Monmouth , N.J. , not in South Vietnam ( which fell to the Communists in 1975 ) . And no documents show her winning a Purple Heart . There was a fire in the St. Louis records center , but it was in 1973 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has only a " nursing background " and was never a registered nurse . She says she was under medication for breast cancer when interviewed by PEOPLE and was confused . " I promise you , " she says , " I am not a hoax , and neither are these 36 individuals . " Spence 's interest in AIDS began when her husband , Gary , a San Francisco-area department store window designer , became infected with the HIV virus . They decided to move to her native Texas in 1988 , she says , because she thought the blood supply there would be less tainted . Gary died a year later . Since then she has worked for the Ark-Tex Council of Governments , which services a nine-county area in Texas . Spence vehemently denies her findings are false or fraudulent . " I have n't fabricated anything , " she says . " Nothing . Those figures are taken from people who really do exist . This is not a hoax with these kids . " She would not ask the infected teens to speak to PEOPLE  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't put them up to save my neck , " she says . " I do n't want to ruin their lives . " It may be several weeks before the Texas Department of Health determines whether Spence is telling the truth . If she has perpetrated a fraud , it will be a particularly cynical hoax . However , the consequences are more ominous if her findings are correct . It will mean that AIDS has made an open grab at a whole new group of victims . <p>
