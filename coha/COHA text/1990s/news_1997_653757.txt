<p> In this corner , weighing in at 3,326 pounds : the Ford Taurus , America 's best-selling car . In that corner , weighing in at as much as 5,174 pounds : the Ford Expedition , one of the most popular among the fast-growing category known as light trucks that includes sport utility vehicles , pickup trucks and mini-vans . <p> Such mismatches , even more striking with sports vehicle behemoths like the Chevrolet Suburban that weighs up to 6,750 pounds , are becoming far more common on America 's roads . The consequences can be deadly . More Americans now die in crashes involving a car and a light truck than in crashes involving two cars , Federal accident statistics show . And that is true even though light trucks still make up just a third of all vehicles on the roads and are involved in fewer crashes than cars . <p> What is more , of the 5,426 people killed in collisions between cars and light trucks in 1995 , the most recent year for which statistics are available , only 20 percent were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( The number killed in collisions between cars in 1995 was 4,271 . ) <p> The gap in weight between light trucks and cars has widened considerably in recent years . For the first time since the Government began keeping reliable records in 1984 , the average light truck outweighed the average car by at least half a ton , or 1,000 pounds , in the 1995 and 1996 model years , the most recent for which figures are available . Yet most cars are designed to meet Federal crash standards that test a car 's ability to withstand a collision with a similarly shaped vehicle within 500 pounds of its own weight . <p> The main criticism of light trucks has long been their poor fuel economy , with the largest models getting less than 15 miles a gallon in city driving . But now Federal and nongovernment experts are also concerned about the safety question . The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will issue several reports within a few days looking at the links between safety and vehicle weight . The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of accident claims , also plans a study later this year on accidents involving light trucks , said Brian O'Neill , the group 's president . <p> Safety engineers at Federal agencies , auto makers and advocacy groups all agree that collisions between vehicles of mismatched weights tend to be the deadliest . In an accident , the sheer bulk of a light truck " will provide some benefits to its occupants , in effect , by penalizing the occupants of smaller vehicles , " Mr. O'Neill said . <p> Safety experts at most private groups make the further claim , contested by auto makers , that the design of light trucks makes them an even greater threat to cars than their weight would suggest . <p> For example , even though fewer than a quarter of all buyers of sport utility vehicle use them for off-road driving , most models are designed with very high ground clearances to allow travel over rocky , rutted roads without leaving a trail of parts from the undercarriage . Because the bumpers and frames of many bigger light trucks are higher off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , the light trucks tend to hit cars in structurally weak places , said Robert D. Knoll , the director of automobile testing for Consumer Reports magazine . <p> " In many cases , it would go over the bumper and into parts of the vehicle that are n't designed to take the impact , " Mr. Knoll said . As one example , the nine-seat Ford Expedition has a bumper that reaches 31 inches off the ground , whereas the Taurus 's is 21 inches . <p> Almost all light trucks are made by separately assembling the body and a stiff steel-framed underbody , and then lowering the body onto the frame and welding it . Cars used to be built this way , but these days almost all cars are so-called unibody designs in which a lightweight steel shell is welded together and then filled with seats , a dashboard and other equipment . When the steel beams that form a light truck 's rectangular underbody encounter the thinner steel lattice of an automobile 's shell , they tend to inflict a lot of damage , said Gerald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highway and Auto Safety , an advocacy group in Washington . <p> Safety engineers at auto makers acknowledge that the greater weight of sport utility vehicles and other light trucks gives them an advantage in crashes , but contend that the designs are not a problem . The two steel beams that run the length of the underbody of Ford 's light trucks , for example , have a wavy pattern near the front that is designed to let them compress in an accident , reducing the odds that they will punch through the other vehicle , said Charles E. Christopher , a Ford safety engineer . <p> " It 's not just a big dagger sticking out there ; it 's designed to collapse , " Mr. Christopher said . <p> A draft of one report being prepared by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that Federal investigators are worried because sport utility vehicles , pickup trucks and mini-vans are not only becoming more common but are also becoming larger and heavier . <p> " Continued growth in the number and weight of light trucks , unless offset by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collisions between the trucks and smaller road users , " said the draft , which has been circulated for peer review by safety experts at other Federal agencies . <p> Safety administration officials declined to comment on the issue until the reports are released in the next few days . <p> To be sure , not all light trucks are large . But as Americans buy more and more sport utility vehicles , pickups and mini-vans these days , they are favoring the biggest models , like the Suburban and Chevrolet 's 5,154-pound extended-cab pickup . Sales of such full-size pickup trucks , for example , have nearly doubled since 1991 , while sales of compact pickup trucks have fallen slightly over the period . Sales of large sport utility vehicles like the 4,933-pound Land Cruiser by Toyota and the 4,960-pound Range Rover by Land Rover have quintupled in the last five years . <p> By contrast , the Toyota Camry midsize sedan weighs 3,086 pounds ; the smaller Honda Civic is 2,438 pounds and G.M. 's compact Geo Metro weighs just 1,962 pounds . <p> Light trucks have soared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want bigger vehicles . A quirk in Federal regulations prevents the auto makers from simply selling a lot of big cars like station wagons , the quirk being that Federal fuel economy standards are much higher for cars than for light trucks . <p> The Transportation Department sets the fuel-efficiency standards for light trucks and has been discussing for several years whether to raise them . The pending reports by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration try to assess the safety consequences of reducing the average weight of light trucks by 100 pounds , which might happen if fuel-efficiency standards are raised . <p> The draft reports concluded that such a weight change would reduce the number of Americans killed in fatal crashes by 50 each year , and reduce the number of serious injuries annually by 601 . But the number of less serious injuries would rise by 1,794 , the reports concluded , as the light trucks would provide less protection for occupants in hitting trees and other hazards . <p> These conclusions have been criticized in a separate report prepared by the Transportation Research Board of the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . The board concluded that there were so many variables involved , such as the use of seat belts and the relative aggressiveness of drivers , that it was impossible to form any firm conclusions about the safety consequences of building sport utility vehicles , mini-vans and pickup trucks that weigh less . <p> Detroit 's Big Three auto makers bitterly oppose any move to raise fuel-efficiency standards for light trucks because the companies make all of their profits on light trucks and actually lose money on cars . Higher fuel-efficiency standards would tend to help their Japanese rivals , which produce mostly cars and which tend to build engines that are somewhat less powerful and therefore more fuel efficient . Higher fuel-efficiency standards could widen the American trade deficit with Japan and hurt American workers and companies , Detroit executives warn . <p> Groups like Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety favor two big design changes to reduce the risks that light trucks pose : requiring all vehicles to have bumpers of the same height and replacing the steel beams in light-truck frames with lighter , steel-lattice " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Putting higher bumpers on cars would interfere with their aerodynamics and fuel efficiency . Putting lower bumpers on light trucks would ruin the rugged , boxy look that so many buyers find attractive . And while a few new sport utility vehicles have unibody designs , like the 2,600-pound Toyota RAV4 , changing the designs of Jeep Grand Cherokees and other light trucks would take many years and cost billions of dollars . <p> Auto makers say that a reduction in traffic accidents is better accomplished by cracking down on drunken drivers , encouraging seat belt use and fixing potholes . " It would be much more productive to improve highways , " said Jason H. Vines , a Chrysler Corporation spokesman . <p> The overall safety record of pickup trucks , sport utility vehicles and mini-vans is mixed . Because their centers of gravity are higher , the tallest of these are more likely to roll over , particularly during tight high-speed turns . Their stiff steel underbodies also transmit a lot of the shock of a crash to the occupants when a light truck hits a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , light trucks have not been required to meet some of the safety standards set for cars . <p> While occupants of light trucks tend to fare better than car occupants in multiple-vehicle accidents , their fatality rates are higher in single-vehicle accidents , according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety . <p> But when asked what they would like to be driving in case of an accident between a sport utility vehicle and a car , auto executives invariably choose the light truck . " I 'd rather be in an Explorer if that should occur , " said Ross H. Roberts , the general manager of the Ford division . <p> Graphs : There are twice as many cars as light trucks on the road , but collisions involving light trucks ( mini-vans , pickups and sport utility vehicles ) kill more people  --  usually in the cars they hit .
