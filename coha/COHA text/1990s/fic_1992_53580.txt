They always meet us at the door and search what we 're carrying , before we can go in . It 's the same for everybody  --  routine  --  but it makes me feel guilty . As if they think we 'd be trying to smuggle in something dangerous . <p> The thing is , we do n't even realize sometimes , my wife and I. What counts as dangerous , I mean . We learned the obvious things early on  --  they made us take Dee Dee 's Far Side mug back home with us that first day , and the instant coffee we brought her had to be poured into a margarine tub . Those things made sense , once they were explained to us . Glass and ceramic , you could smash them and come up with a jagged edge . Dee Dee asked us for a jump rope , because they would n't let her go outside alone to run or even walk . We went to the sports store and bought one of those high-tech ropes with wood handles and a strap at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for inspection , it got checked with the sharps . <p> A jump rope ? . I said , and Helen said Honey to me , and then I got it , too . The thought of it pulled something inside my gut and with the pull came a picture of my daughter , double-jumping between her best friends in the street we lived on , her hair bouncing in a braid . Down in the valley where the green grass grows , there sat Dee Dee as pretty as a rose . <p> Our daughter 's bed is the middle one in a room of three . She faces the window when she sleeps , and on the door of the standing closet she has taped the get-well cards her friends sent her , Snoopys and teddy bears , the messages inside signed with X 's and O 's . At first I thought she would n't want to tell anybody she was here , but my wife thinks it 's healthy , she should n't be ashamed . " What if she was in with a broken leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom . It 's not something to hide . " Still , I sense that she shares my discomfort at having people know . This is a psychiatric unit , not a hospital for bones or blood . <p> She has been here a week now , and unless they discharge her sooner than they expect to , she will still be here on her birthday , her twenty-fourth . Last year we all marked the twenty-third by going to a Red Sox game , Dee Dee and her brother , Dan , Dee Dee 's boyfriend , Edward , and Helen and I. The Red Sox won that night , and Dee Dee and Edward got engaged . Dee Dee called it a triple play , all those things to celebrate at the same time . <p> They were married in December , and they moved to an apartment in town , close to the law school , where they met in Torts . It 's not a great neighborhood . I told Dee Dee from the beginning that I was worried about her walking home at night from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study together , and most of the time , they did . <p> But on the thirtieth of April , a week ago , Edward was playing softball with other men from their class , and he joined them afterward for beer at the Pourhouse , across from the playing field . Dee Dee worked in the library until nine o'clock , past sunfall , and then she gathered up her books in the leather backpack I gave her for Christmas . <p> She stopped at the convenience store for a frozen dinner , and then began to walk down the long block , toward the apartment . When she was halfway there , a man stepped out of the alley behind the laundromat , and asked her for a light . When she said she did n't have one , he moved behind her in a single motion she felt rather than saw ; he tore the backpack away from her and threw it in the dumpster . Then he grabbed her by the wrists and leaned her against the laundromat 's brick wall , lifting his hand to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nose and slid her down to the cement and pushed her back , putting the frozen dinner under her head for a pillow . Relax , he told her , and when she laughed , so did he . But after the laugh she could n't breathe because he was blocking her air , and she passed out , then came to sometime later , when he was finishing . He ran off , and she gathered herself together and went home . <p> This is what she told the police , after Edward returned to find her shaking under the covers , sucking her thumb . She had showered and dressed in a nightgown and put her clothes through the wash . She tried to convince him that nothing was the matter , she was just feeling sick , she was anxious about exams . But he did n't believe her , and finally she told him that she had been raped . Edward tried to put his arm around her but she would n't let him . She began rocking a little , and Edward got scared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't , and then he called us . When the police got there she did n't talk until they brought in a woman officer . <p> Helen and Edward and I waited in the small living room , and ! read the titles of books on the shelf behind my son-in-law 's shoulder : Fit for Life , Presumed Innocent , Ascent of Man . <p> They brought her to the hospital . We followed , Edward driving , forgetting to brake until the last moment at every light . They took her into an examining room for questions and for tests . Helen tapped the thigh of her jeans with a tin ashtray , and Edward sat with the heels of his hands against his forehead , looking down at his feet . He was still wearing his softball clothes . I concentrated on the TV bolted to a corner of the wall , and I let myself into the world I was watching . It was tuned to The Honeymooners , and when I laughed at something Ed Norton did , Helen said , " Jesus , Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policewoman came out with the doctor , who was also a woman , and they sat down with us , both of them trying to smile . <p> " Is she all right ? " Helen said , and I could tell the words had been dammed up in her throat . <p> " Well , yes , " the doctor said . <p> " What does that mean ? " Edward asked her . The vein in his neck gave away what he wanted to do , which was cry . <p> " Well , we 're a little confused . " The doctor brushed her hand across the clipboard she held , as if gathering to show us in her fingers what her study of Dee Dee had found . " She has all the psychological symptoms of having been raped  --  a classic reaction , in fact . The trauma is very real . But her medical condition is n't consistent with the assault she described . " <p> " What does that mean ? " Edward asked again . Helen tossed the ashtray onto the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What are you telling us ? " Helen said . <p> This time it was the officer who answered . " We ca n't be sure , but it 's possible she was n't actually aware of what happened , if she was passed out , " she said . " She feels brutalized  --  that 's clear  --  but there is n't any physical evidence of rape . Or of any sexual encounter in quite a while , is that right ? " She was checking with the doctor , who nodded , looking down again . <p> The rest of us turned to look at Edward . " Oh , for God 's sake , " he said . " We 've both been tired . It 's exam time . Besides , she has n't been into it , lately . " He reached back to rub his neck . " I ca n't believe I 'm talking about this . " <p> Helen was brushing her hair . She does this when she 's nervous , takes the brush out of her purse at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard strokes . <p> " There 's something you 're not saying , " she said to the doctor and the policewoman . " Tell us what it is . " <p> The two women looked at each other to decide who would answer ; the doctor gave it with her eyes to the cop , who said , " We think it 's possible that for some reason , she made a false report . " <p> " You mean lied ? " Edward shot up out of his chair . " What the hell are you saying ? " <p> " She would never do that , " I told them . " It has to be true . " <p> Then Dee Dee was at the edge of the waiting room , one hand against the wall , accompanied by a nurse who stood close with arms half-lifted , ready to provide a catch . " Honey , " Helen said , and went to her , and I followed , but our daughter halted us with a raised and trembling palm . Edward coughed , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightless in her fiat white face . <p> " They 're right , " she said . " There was n't anybody . I made him up . I 'm sorry . " <p> Her birthday falls on a Wednesday , and by noontime I still have n't decided what to get for her . I 'm afraid of fumbling , of offering the wrong thing . Helen has bought and wrapped many gifts from us together , for this occasion  --  more than any other birthday or Christmas of the past , as if we could build with all the packages a fortress against the danger looking for entrance to our daughter 's mind . But I always like to give a remembrance that 's just from me , and walking back to the office from lunch , I pass the window at Snyder 's and have a brainstorm . This is where I bought the leather backpack for Dee Dee at Christmastime , and when I go inside I find one identical to the original gift , and on my way into my building , carrying the bag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Helen , I say , " What about the backpack ? She said the guy threw it in the dumpster . If she was wrong , does that mean she still has it. ? " <p> This is how we speak of that night , to each other : we use words like upset instead of crazy , wrong instead of lie . Helen  --  who keeps losing weight in her voice and body , all her energy used up in fretting , trying to figure this thing out  --  sighs and says she does n't know , she does n't know , so I call Edward and ask him , and he says no , the police did find it in the garbage , and I say , How can that be ? , and he says he does n't know , either . I suggest that this may be a clue in support of Dee Dee 's story , and Edward reminds me that she admitted it was a lie . <p> " I hate that word , " I tell him , and he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trying to keep up with classes  --  Dee Dee thought she 'd be able to , too , studying with the notes he copied for her , planning to ask for passes from the hospital to take her exams  --  but she gave up the first week and applied for Incompletes , and though Edward swears he will not , he may have to do the same . Usually we go at different times to see her , because the doctors recommend short and separate visits , so ! do n't know how things have been between Edward and Dee Dee , whether they suffer the same silences as Helen and Dan and I when it is our turn , or whether she has been able to explain anything to her husband in a way he can understand . <p> Everything here in the hospital depends on your privileges , or what the initiated call privs : whether you can leave the unit at all , how often , for how long , and with whom . Privs are n't issued as reward or punishment , the nurse on duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are determined by how " safe " the staff thinks you are , and how much responsibility you can be trusted with , mostly for yourself . <p> " What the hell does safe mean ? " I remember asking . Helen and I were standing with the nurse in a corner of the unit . Edward and Dee Dee were going through her suitcase with a counselor , separating out the things she could conceivably hurt herself with : they took custody of her hair dryer , her compact mirror , notebooks with wire spirals . <p> " Most of the people who come here have been self-destructive at some point , " the nurse told us . <p> " You mean suicidal ? " Helen said . In the car on the way over she 'd made me stop , telling me she had to vomit , but nothing happened , and I thought she might be bringing it up now . <p> " Sometimes , but not necessarily . " The nurse looked even younger than Dee Dee . She did n't wear a uniform , but instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her arms were tan already , this early in the season , and I guessed she had been on vacation in the last month , someplace warm , with someone who loved her . " A lot of sexually abused women cut themselves with a razor or a knife . On their arms , mostly , or sometimes on their legs . " She watched us react and then paused , like a teacher waiting for her students to catch up in their notes . " The internal pain is so intense that it gives them a distraction , and relief , to feel something physical instead . " <p> " But Dee Dee said she was n't raped , " Helen said , and the words seemed to choke her . <p> I took her hand , which was shockingly cold , and reminded her , " We do n't know what happened . " <p> " Well . " The nurse looked as if she wanted to smile at us , for comfort , but decided halfway into the gesture that it was n't the right one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy . " She reached out to pat Helen 's sleeve , and I waited to be touched too , but at that moment the counselor brought Dee Dee over with the searched suitcase , and we had to say goodbye . We would have hugged her , but they had already advised us of the hospital rule against personal contact , so I lifted my fingertips to my lips and kissed them , then turned them in a salute to my daughter , hoping she would know how much I wanted it to mean . When she picked up the suitcase to bring it to her room , I stole a look up and down her arms , to check for scars , and I noticed Helen doing the same thing ; our eyes met in relief when we saw the flesh intact , and on our way out to the car we gripped each other around the waist , tightly , digging our nails in , until it hurt . <p> After two weeks , Dee Dee 's privileges allow her only as far as the building 's basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundry , and Ping-Pong . It 's here , on the white tile floor , that Dee Dee stretches and jumps rope , when she can get one of the counselors to supervise . Along came Somebody and kissed her on the nose . ( " Somebody " always changed , a different boy 's name every time I heard it sung to the slap of the rope against the sidewalk . ) How many kisses did she get ? <p> We have a Ping-Pong table in our basement at home , but the kids never learned to play because I always had it piled with junk from my worktable , where I make things out of wood . When Dan was a baby I bought him a toy tool set , but he dropped the hammer when ! put it in his hand , and it was Dee Dee I would find playing with the plastic screws and wrenches , concentrating on some close task , tongue set between her teeth . <p> By the time she was five she was helping me shape things , her small hands piggybacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would climb the stairs from our Saturday sessions trailing sawdust from our shoes , and at supper Helen could n't understand why we were n't hungry , because she did n't know about the candy we ate in secret while we worked . <p> Dee Dee takes us down here , to the circle of seats around the low table scarred with graffiti , Dr. Flembag sucks and Please help me engraved in light scratches across the cheap blond wood . We give her the birthday presents , pretending this is all going on in our living room , our neighborhood outside . When I hand Dee Dee the last one , my fingers brush her arm , and she pulls back with such a jerk that the package falls . <p> " What 's the matter ? " I say . <p> " Tom , no personal contact . " Helen gets up and moves between me and Dee Dee on the couch , as if we are siblings in the back seat of a car . Still , she is trying to preserve the mood of a party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side of her , but careful not to touch . " You always break the rules . " <p> The next morning Helen and I are both dressing for work . I am still a little breathless and cloudy from the dream I was having when the alarm went off , which I remembered distinctly and with dread for the few minutes before I got up , and then forgot in the first motions of the day . <p> We have n't had sex in a month , since before all this began . Helen does n't seem to miss it , and I am glad , because I could n't touch her if she wanted me to , but this way it 's not my fault . The subtlest connection of our limbs in bed makes my heart speed up , but not with desire . She has not seemed to notice that I feel this way , and I would not be able to tell her why , if she did ask , because I ca n't tell myself . <p> Dee Dee is the one we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first few days there seems to be nothing to say . We have forgone our usual meals together in favor of snacks eaten standing at the kitchen counter or in front of the TV . Dan used to come by often , to do his laundry or to pick up mail that had n't made it to his new apartment , and before all this he stayed a while , and we talked about his job or the Red Sox or a gift he wanted to date , but lately he 's only in and out , hurrying to finish his errands , moving through the house the way he would through a post office or a laundromat . He mumbles his goodbyes . <p> Except for when we sleep , Helen and I are hardly ever together in the same room . There is none that feels big enough for us , that can contain both our bodies and the balance between them . Helen keeps finding things to blame me for , and even if I 'm not guilty , I let her . I wait for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much time passes between accusations I get nervous , thinking she is storing them all up for one big strike to my blind side . <p> So that morning we get a phone call , the phone call , from the hospital , from the social worker assigned to Dee Dee 's case , a Lolly Sheftick , which is enough to make you laugh , except that she does n't look the way her name sounds , like a crazy grandmother with bad makeup and a wig  --  in fact she 's pretty in a flushed and angled way , taller than Helen and slimmer , but with a smile that includes rather than threatens women less good-looking than she . <p> She has called us here to discuss " a matter of some urgency . " This Lolly Sheftick explains to us outside her office , in a quiet voice around a table strewn with Good Housekeeping and Self A plant in the center of the table sheds brown leaves from its pot , and I wonder who is responsible for not taking care of it . Lolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me through the door that shows her name , but instead she says she would like to talk to my wife first , privately , and would I please wait here . <p> Helen looks at me for some clue , some secret signal , to tell her what this means . I shrug  --  the movement is spastic , beyond my control . They go behind the door and shut it , and I am alone in the lobby , except for a woman who sits at the reception desk ; but she is listening to something through the headset of a Dictaphone , so I am , essentially , alone . <p> I sit there . After some time I remember where I am , and I stand suddenly and the receptionist looks up with a startled motion , a palm flying to her chest . ! lift a hand to show her I 'm sorry , and I knock on Lolly Sheftick 's door . She opens the door , and beyond it in a chair against the wall , I see my wife still waiting , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " But Mr. Osborne , we 're not ready yet , " and I tell her , " Yes , I am . " <p> " I want to hear this , " I add . " Please let me in . " <p> " Mrs. Osborne ? " Lolly says . " Do you mind if he 's here , too ? " <p> " Of course not . He 's my husband , " Helen says . " Why would I mind ? You 're scaring me , " she says to Lolly . " You 'd better tell me why . " <p> There is an empty seat next to Helen , but instead I take the one that makes a triangle among us , and I look at the four feminine legs across from me , both sets crossed at the knee , my wife 's tapping the carpet with the toe of her best pumps . We both changed our clothes after we got the phone call , without discussing it . We seemed to realize that what we had on already would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lolly Sheftick folds her hands on top of her knee and says , " This is not going to be an easy thing . I asked Dee Dee if she wanted to be here , but she said no . She 's probably right , actually . It would probably be too much . " <p> " Are you going to tell us why she said she was raped , when she was n't ? " Helen , I see , is wrapping her fingers in a grip stronger than prayer . <p> " Well , " Lolly Sheftick says , " we believe it 's more complicated than that . No , she was n't attacked two weeks ago . She 's told us that . We believe  --  and we 've talked to Dee Dee about this  --  that she made up the attack to explain the feelings she 's having now about something that happened long ago . " <p> " Long ago ? . " Helen says , and I watch her hands come apart in her lap . <p> Lolly nods . She picks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she fingers it . <p> " Are you telling me my daughter was raped a long time ago ? " Helen laughs . " That 's impossible . Impossible . I do n't know what you 're saying . " She looks at me and puts her hand out , palm up in my direction , to show me that it 's my turn , now , to object to what she 's hearing . <p> But I have left the office , let myself leave the body that still sits in my place , decided not to listen anymore . I make a sound that could mean anything . Helen stiffens in her chair . Lolly Sheftick lifts the cap of the pen to her mouth , pulls in between her lips , bites it , then yanks it out through her teeth . <p> " Mr. Osborne , " she says , " this is uncomfortable , I know . It 's worse than that . But I have to tell you both that what Dee Dee remembers has to do with you . " Though her tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she can destroy me , I see the hatred in her face . <p> " It does , " I say , meaning to make it a question , but it does n't come out that way . <p> " What ? " Helen says . She picks her purse off the floor and begins to rummage for her hairbrush , though she looks not inside the bag but at my hands , which start to dance along the chair arms . <p> " What , Tom ? " she says , locating the brush , and in taking it out she flips a book of matches on the floor . " Wait . Wait . Do n't tell me . " She presses the bristles deep into the flesh of her palm . <p> " Stop that , " I tell her , frowning at the brush , and I think of reaching over to take it from her , but my hands are still rapping and fluttering at the side arms of my seat . We watch them , the three of us . <p> Finally , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word , Helen leans forward with the brush and smacks it down on my fingers . Lolly Sheftick giggles  --  not a long one , she stops as soon as she hears it , but it is enough to make her realize she should n't have , and she says , " I 'm sorry . " <p> " What happens now ? " I ask , after a moment . On Lolly 's desk there is a photograph of her and someone else , but it is too small to see distinctly , and I resist the urge to squint or lean to make out the details . <p> " Okay , tell me , " Helen says , still clenching the handle . She is speaking to me , but she looks at Lolly , whose eyes send me some pity along with her contempt . There are certain things we learn by being human , and one is that we 're more alike than we can bear . <p> " Mr. Osborne ? " she asks . <p> But when she sees me spinning , she tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father , " she says , the words emerging at a slow , distorted speed . " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Osborne . " <p> " Oh , for God 's sake , " Helen says . " That 's not true . " She actually seems to smile . " I 'm so sick of this abuse talk , it 's everywhere you go . Abuse , abuse . How come you never used to hear that word ? It 's the latest thing . A fad , like sushi . " <p> I wait for Lolly to laugh again , but instead she looks disturbed . I watch us from a corner of the ceiling , where I 'm hanging from a nerve . <p> " I understand your reaction , " she tells Helen . " We see it all the time . You do n't want to believe it . Neither does Dee Dee . " She tosses the pen onto her blotter , opens the desk drawer , and pulls out a cigarette from a pack of Merits , which she lights with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels them in her body , " Lolly says , turning her head to exhale toward the wall above her desk , at the buzzer labeled HELP . " She 's re-experiencing the sensations , as if they 're happening to her now . It 's not unusual . I 'm sorry , " she says again , dragging for dear life . <p> She looks at me . " Do you have anything you want to say , Mr. Osborne ? I realize this is ... " But there is no language for what this is , and she can see it in my face . When I start to speak , I choke on my own swallow , and cough to clear my throat . <p> Helen is waiting , her breath suspended , her body taut with dread . " I did n't abuse her , " I tell them , and my wife 's release is audible . Before she can turn it into words , I head her off and whisper , " I would n't call it that . " <p> How do these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I forgot , like Dee Dee  --  although they say she did n't , either , not the way you forget the name of someone you hardly know . <p> No , I remember all the nights , the darkness of her room , the way the walls held us in comfort when it was cold outside . And in summer , with the windows open , how the air would touch us through the screen , and I would lift the sheet across her shoulder and watch her fall to sleep . <p> When it began , she welcomed me , her body making barely a dimple in the big-girl bed . I felt such love for her , such wonder ; and as I swept her hair behind the soft part of her ear , she closed her eyes and smiled . We played a game with words , Dee Dee and Daddy , whispering them to each other until the syllables got twisted and the names became nonsense . We called it tucking in . <p> There was no sin in it , to start with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do overcame the no I knew I should be heeding ; I looked into her face and saw the light there , the smile and the trust , and I changed them because I could , no other reason , I saw that I could leave a mark as long as life and so I did it . I know it and , God help me , knew it then , but only the way you know a thing in theory , with other people 's proofs at the back of the book . You look them up and see how they arrived there , and you know the answers to be true ; but at the test it goes out of your head , you are back to your own sad way of figuring , and you forget what you swore to yourself you would understand in time . <p> In the mornings it woke with me . Not as far back as the little bed , but the moments after , when I went down the hall and in to Helen . I felt like a burglar in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened my eyes I sent my memory of the night to lodge in a place other than conscience , which was filled up long ago . Even so , at breakfast , I waited for my daughter to turn her head from me , and it always took me by surprise when she would plop a kiss against my forehead and ask me how I was . <p> Now , they tell me why : during the nights , after I left her , a cloud spread through her senses , wiping out my visits and waking her in white . Until this spring . Was it the thaw ? Her class on criminals ? A movement Edward made above her in the bed ? <p> It stopped when she was twelve . She got her period that year , and when Helen came to tell me , looking proud and brave ( I think she had been crying ) , I was down in the basement building Dee Dee a new bureau , sanding off the boards . My wife held a basket of laundry , a mix of dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids ' gym suits , the dust rags , and the towels . She set the load on top of the washer to leave her arms free for a hug , and when I held her in it , our bodies fitting flush so nothing could have come between them , I heard , " She 's not my baby anymore , " and I swear to God I could n't tell which one of us had said it . <p> Later , when Dee Dee came down to inspect the bureau , I offered her candy , and she took it , watching me while she ate ; I hid my wrapper the way we used to so Helen would n't know , but she folded hers in half and dropped it in the trash bucket , where it fell without a sound . She ran her fingers over the drawers and showed me where they needed smoothing . She told me which varnish she wanted me to use . When Helen called us for supper , she waited until I went up the steps first , instead of letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That night I fell asleep with my arms around Helen , and I woke a few hours later with a jolt , thinking I had been caught , until I remembered that I belonged there , and that I would n't have to leave . When I realized that I expected to find myself in a bed that I had soiled , I felt more guilt than after any time with Dee Dee , and I got up and went to her doorway , where I stood and watched her sleep . <p> She lay curled in an impossibly small space at the edge of the mattress , and her thumb was in her mouth . She was the baby we set to nap in a laundry basket , prone on a pillow , wrapped in my flannel shirt . She was easy to carry that way , and it was all we could afford . That first summer , we took her everywhere with us  --  to the Esplanade for fireworks , to the beach , even to Fenway Park . She seldom cried , and she outgrew Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let their mothers from their sight . On the playground , when she fell , she froze in landing , and we waited for the wail . But before Helen or I or another grown-up could move to comfort her , she got up to kiss herself on the injury  --  the finger or the foot  --  and smearing the tears away she joined the game again . <p> When she began to change positions in the bed ! turned from the doorway , not wanting to be seen , and behind me my son was standing , with his finger on the light . He switched it off , and the hall went dark , turning us to shadows . " What 's up , Dad ? " Danny said , and I could feel him wanting to believe what I would say . <p> " Just checking , " I told him , and I sent him back to bed . But I saw him waiting by his window , hugging his long arms , until I left his sister 's door . <p> Maybe it 's silly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difference to Dee Dee , she might say she 'd talk to me , if I brought some cherry Danish to the hospital for her . Helen will only speak to me on the phone , and just barely , after the day in Lolly Sheftick 's office a week ago . When Helen started to lose control that morning , Lolly took her to another room , and I stood to make them think I would go back to the lounge ; but when they had left I shut the door behind them , and sat down at Lolly 's desk . The photograph I had tried to get a look at earlier was propped against the wall . It was a picture of Lolly and a man , in summer , their arms around each other 's bathing-suit waists , her head against his chest . I put my hand out to touch it , and dust fluttered from the frame . <p> On Friday , after work , I drive back to the motel where I 've been staying and change my clothes and get a dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital , and when I get there I park on the far side of the lot , and eat the dinner , waiting for my family to show up . Visiting hours begin at five-thirty , and at six Helen and Dan arrive together , and they go into the building . A few minutes later Dee Dee comes outside with them , and they walk to a cluster of wood chairs in the center of the lawn . I watch them talking ; they even laugh . Then Dan picks up a stick from the ground and begins jabbing it at the grass , until Helen tells him to stop it ; I can see reproach in her face , but when he drops the stick , she leans over to touch his knee . <p> I think about getting out and going over , but I am not even supposed to be here . Helen 's made that plain . Instead I sit there with the window rolled down .

Dan shakes his head a lot , and Dee Dee 's face looks old across the yard . <p> Helen does much of the talking , and at the end of the visit , when they stand and head back to the hall , she puts a hand on each child 's shoulder . They are passing near my car , though I know they wo n't notice it , because they do n't look to the sides as they move forward , just keep on going straight , not because there is nothing to appreciate around these grounds but because there is too much that my daughter needs permission to see and touch and feel . <p> When they are beyond me and almost to the door , I press my horn a couple of ames , trying not to sound frantic , before they can disappear . Dee Dee jumps at the first toot , and at the second all three of them turn around to stare . Then Dan and Dee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . I put my head out and say , " Hey , hi , " and Dee Dee is the first to answer . <p> " Oh , Daddy , " she says to me . <p> But no one makes a move until I ask , " Will you guys come here a minute ? I 'm not going to get out , " and cautiously they all move toward me . <p> " You 're not supposed to be here , " Helen says . <p> " I know . But I wanted to see you , " I tell them . " Where 's Edward ? " <p> " He 's not here , " Dee Dee says . <p> " I see that . " <p> Dan kicks the tire and says , " Look , what do you want ? " <p> " Nothing , " I say . His anger scares me . A breeze blows by , and the smell of my burger carton comes up from the car floor to make me queasy . <p> " Then get out of here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dee Dee ? " <p> Helen says , " You 've got to be kidding . " <p> " What , Dad ? " My daughter takes a step forward and pulls her hair around her face . " Tell me . " <p> They are all waiting for what I have to say . But I 've forgotten what it was , or if I even knew . " Sorry , " I mumble , meaning that I 'm lost , but Dan takes it for something else . <p> " Sorry ? " he says . " You 're sorry ? " He laughs , then spits across the pavement . <p> " That 's not what I meant , " I tell him , but he will not understand . <p> " You 'd better go , " my wife says . She touches Dee Dee 's elbow from behind , and Dee Dee tenses , then smiles at her mother so she wo n't take offense . <p> " Okay , " I say , and start the engine . The smell of food and the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lose control of the clutch , and the car sputters , and looking up to turn the key again , I see my son making a face , as if he knows he could expect no more of me . <p> " Wait , " Dee Dee says , putting a hand out . I shift to neutral , trying not to flinch . She leans into the car . Her face is at my level . " I 'm going to be okay , you know , " she tells me . I nod foolishly , and drive away confused . Was she trying to give me comfort ? Or claim a victory ? <p> We used to have a date on weekend mornings . We made trips to the bakery , even before Dan was up to watch cartoons , and we never told anyone about our secret , about the pastries we ate on the way home and the Cokes we drank with them . The men in the bakery had a game , pretending week to week that they 'd forgotten Dee Dee 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their routine , calling out " Irene ! " and " Mildred ! " to see how she 'd respond . <p> At first , when she was little , she shook her head ; sometimes she laughed at an odd or ugly name . They knew , of course , and before they gave us our breakfast they said the real one , and she waved goodbye , hugging the warm bag to her chest . <p> But on the morning that turned out to be our last one there , she would n't let them play . She was older then , and instead of picking out a cherry Danish , she asked for a corn muffin with jelly on the side . <p> " Okay , Lucille , " one of the men said , as he reached into the case . <p> " Tell them my name , Dad , " Dee Dee said . <p> " They know it , honey . " I shrugged at the man to show I could n't help my kid 's manners . <p> " Tell them , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightened behind the glass display . <p> " Honey  --  " <p> " Tell them , " she said a third time , so close to breaking that the men looked at each other and then at the floor . " Tell . Tell . Tell . " <p> Behind us a line was rustling . " Goddammit , " I said , slapping a dollar on the counter . " Her name is Deirdre Anne . " <p> " Okay , " my daughter said , " let 's go , " and she took the bag and turned . <p> In the car I said , " What 's wrong with you ? " <p> She was buckling her seat belt , and her hair fell in her face . " Nothing . " Her voice held more , but she contained it ; I could see her swallow something down . <p> We pulled away and ! told her , " You embarrassed me back there . " She was eating her muffin and she tried to answer , but her throat was thick with crumbs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all we 'd ended up with . I almost hit the car in front of me , with my hand out for my share . But she looked out the window as if she had n't noticed , and I saw that she was n't going to give me any of what she still had left . <p> <p> By Jessica Treadway <p> Jessica Treadway 's collection of short stories , Absent Without Leave , will be published this fall by Delphinium Books .
