BEFORE HIS RELATIVES BUNCH around his wife and children on one side of the courtroom , before the attorneys whittle the panel of fifty prospects down to a jury , Tyrone can read his future in the judge 's eyes . The future says Black , guilty , twenty years . The judge 's eyes blink and Tyrone 's trapped in a snapshot . The judge looks at Tyrone 's attorney and focuses on the snazzy suit , the gold cuff links , and the diamond pinkie ring that spell easy wealth . On the district attorney who wears a tasteful and understated , hard-working blue suit . No contest . <p> Tyrone clutches the arms of his chair , knuckles edging up under his skin . He sees twenty years in a tiny cell , twenty years with only the stink and clamor of other men . He holds on tight to keep from flying away . Flying or dying wo n't do him any good now . The light of justice passes clean through him like a laser , a high-tech terrorizer that can jumble cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains his innocence , can be convinced that he is , in fact , guilty . <p> Prospective jurors are called forward in small groups . One by one , with the judge 's interest encouraging them , they tell their life stories . From the Ice Age through the Birth of Man , where they grew up , whether they 've ever traveled , if they 've been the victim of a crime . Unsure of what the judge seeks , they cover their tracks with unessential details . They squirm and they sweat . The judge asks , Would you believe the word of a policeman over someone else 's , just because he 's a police . man ? <p> A certain percentage must fail . Some fail because they 're black . Some fail because they know one of the witnesses . Some fail because a sister , father , uncle daily dons blue . Some fail because one of the attorneys mistrusts people of their occupation . Some fail because they 'll miss too much work . Some fail because it 's late in the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyrone squints and slows things down and evens it all out he can see that panel of prospective jurors undulating like a snake , some easing into the jurors ' seats , some being excused and easing out , everyone moving down one or two or three seats , a snake of justice for some , maybe , but to Tyrone more like a snake in the grass . A jury of his peers . <p> Some peers . Squeaky clean and never been knobbed . Nobody in this crowd ever kited a check or lifted so much as an orange . They never had to scrounge for their babies ' clothes . Most of them lived here all their lives , never been to another state let alone country , never saw another neighborhood besides their own lily-white one . No litvaks or limeys here , no spaghettis or spics . And nobody who speaks the lawyers ' own brand of double Dutch , which lack and luck the lawyers find just dandy , because they like to reign supreme . <p> From the jurors ' box it looks no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , and from the time she gets the questionnaire in the mail up until the time she is actually chosen , there is no way she 'll ever serve . Her number is called for a panel late in the afternoon , her luck turning sour at the last minute like a medium-numbered Vietnam draftee 's . Once in the courtroom , she listens to the judge 's questions to all the prospective jurors before her , mixes the answers with the outcomes , and takes the result apart bit by bit , weighing the clues to find her own fate . <p> At close to five the tally stands at eleven jurors selected . Only three left to choose from for the last juror and two alternates , the earlier hordes dwindled down to next to nothing after preemptive challenges from the state and defense and the judge 's excusing for cause . The last man is a brother , two white women in front . Like in a football game , only initiates can understand the score . tyrone 's lawyer wants the man for the last juror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first woman , the state will accept the second . Because it is so late in the day , because it 's such a controversial case , because there is , really , no other choice , Iris becomes the last juror . <p> Tyrone now has his own twelve angry men , though a handful are women , and only one black skin hiding among the whites . One black juror and one black alternate , the rest a sea of milk cupped inside the judicial system to decide the truth for Tyrone . Step by step , Tyrone 's trial will now plod on inevitably to justice . Everything in the world is now part of the process . Each juror , each witness , each tap of the court reporter 's elegantly tapered blood-red nails . Every sidebar , every shred of evidence , every preconception becomes part of the dynasty , tyrone 's legacy , the history of civilization . <p> In his cell that night Tyrone dreams his own dream . He 's sitting on the sofa with his arm around Alysse , the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock or noise , but suddenly Tyrone feels compelled to leave the comfort of his family and open the front door . Beyond which stands Officer Bardwell , big and beefy , arms bristling with fat like salami , belly bursting out over his pants . He 's pointing a Magnum at Tyrone 's head , an enormous hunk of blue steel that glistens in the twilight . Without even thinking , Tyrone takes a step back . With the knowledge that comes in dreams , he feels the tension in the trigger as Bardwell 's finger inexorably applies pressure in tiny but persistent increments . The pounding blood in Tyrone 's head and heart measures out his own march to extinction , each beat reflecting how much closer the bullet is to exploding from the barrel and crashing into him , every second bringing his organs that much closer to bursting . With his free hand Bardwell grabs Tyrone by his belt buckle . Uncomfortable with this insufficient grip , he twists his knuckles down into Tyrone 's belly , the humiliating gesture of the conqueror . Tyrone hears the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream it hovers , waiting for another target . <p> The first real day of Tyrone 's trial blooms bright . He throws down breakfast and waits to be taken to the courthouse . Morning gnaws at his gut . The first order of business is that Iris has told the deputy sheriff that she 's Jewish and will be attending services for Rosh Hashanah that Friday night . As this is only Tuesday , and the trial is expected to be over by Thursday , the judge decides that there is no problem . The deputy sheriff meanders into the jury room to herd the jurors out to the court . Let the games begin , Tyrone thinks . <p> The jurors file in and assume Tyrone 's guilt . He looks mean , but he 's nothing ; a hick boy who tried too hard to be a city boy , nickle and diming deals , playing the game with the wrong hand . A boy like that has made a lot of mistakes by the time he 's a man . Mahoney , the district attorney , drones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grammar to dress up Tyrone 's recent run-ins with the law as the desperate acts of a desperate man . But Tyrone 's not . He shampoos carpets when he can and cuts a few deals on the side . Quiet deals , not on someone else 's turf . Just little stuff , stuff that ca n't hurt anybody . Every one an adult ; he has two kids of his own , he would never mess with kids . No , only adults , . and only ones he knows . Mahoney takes the events of that fateful day , . embroiders and fudges , lists and labels , puffs up and deflates them , then , . neatly tallied and weighed , presents them to the judge , the courtroom reporters , and the jury . <p> Tyrone 's lawyer , Brewer , brooks no nonsense . He sneers at Ma-honey 's eloquence . He purses his lips . He adjusts the knot on his tie . He twirls his elegant monogrammed cuff links in their sockets . He impugns his rival 's version of the events . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the jury , pacing out his sentences , forcing their attention . <p> Tyrone tunes out . He ca n't help it . The judge is an island , rock steady , courteous and complete in his judicial knowledge and bearing . The other players pulse by him , float , sail , dive by him , tossing out flotsam and jetsam , yawing , wallowing , trying to gain their sea legs and impress him , trying not to run aground . They should be trying to convince the jury , but it 's the judge who has the final say , who can rule out and rule in , exclude and discard , include and destroy . So the attorneys ' words at first buffet Tyrone , calling him this and that , then cease to sting and eventually only lap at the comers of consciousness . He daydreams of Belize , where he grew up  --  a place so lost in the Third World that no one in the courtroom can even find it on a map-and there he constructs a good life for himself and Alysse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But too many parts are missing , a chunk of the sky and most of the frame , so he ca n't feel the full weight of it , find any pattern , see the big picture . His dream sizzles away . <p> " State your name . " <p> To the jurors the trial is only an unpleasant civic duty , something they tried their best to get out of but failed , until the first witness takes the stand . Tall , dark , and thin , she has the grace of an ancient Egyptian , a timeless perfection more suited to frieze walls , carrying her beauty not as an invitation but as a carapace . But when she testifies , her memory is no longer an orphan wandering the streets but a child who knows who 's done what to whom and where it belongs and will not rest until it climbs , kicking and screaming , onto the lap it knows , despite protestations , despite proof to the contrary , is rightfully its own . <p> " Felicia Carlton . " <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am , yes . " <p> Her tears are like a cancer , they take root and then spread insidiously. till one morning the pain has invaded everything . Her tears have replaced her memories of her high-school sweetheart , of the life they were building together . Her tears prevent her from recognizing her two daughters . Now she has to learn another language , the language of sorrow . She tries hard to keep her new dialect to herself once she 's on the stand , but the thought of Jack triggers it and right away she 's speaking in tongues . <p> Yes , Jack is dead almost a year now . Yes , he was in a coma for six days , but the air bubbles had already traveled to his brain by the time they operated . Technically , he was brain dead by nightfall . <p> Poor woman . Husband went from hearty and hale to vegetative in a split second , measured on a hair trigger . The man did nothing but try to calm his partner down , diffuse some notable anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs or this school yard , anger at being taken advantage of , being made a fool of , and Jack stepped squarely into that pool of rancor , waltzed around with Tyrone and Officer Bardwell , and when it was over his dance card was permanently up . <p> Experts attest to Jack 's wounds . He is displayed , laid out , flayed in front of the jury . Pictures show the wound from every angle , no stone , no flap of flesh unturned . Charts , diagrams , and Polaroids are whipped out and bandied about . Layouts of the scene of the crime . The van parked just around the corner , the playground , the fence blocking the view . The curb Tyrone claimed to have stepped off of , the road , the parked cars . The sight lines . How low the man fixing the van ducked when he heard the shot . How soon the ambulance came . How much longer the kids had to stay in school that day so they would n't see the unmistakable vestiges of violence . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would the term " hair trigger " apply ? From how high up would this gun need to be dropped for it to discharge accidentally ? Did the police department condone the use of such a temperamental personal gun ? If so , why ? If not , why not ? The witnesses drone on . The courtroom absorbs their opinions and settles in . Tyrone daydreams . One member of the jury dozes . <p> Life and death having already paraded before them , it 's time to take the jurors to lunch . Under the watchful eye of the portly middle-aged deputy sheriff , the jury is escorted via its own private elevator to its own private lunchroom , where unspeakably bad food is provided free of charge . Day after day after day of this and pretty soon the jury will be wondering who is being punished here , whose freedom has been taken away , and resentment against the defendant will grow because he has caused a major inconvenience in their lives . And the courts are n't so dumb , they are n't just incompetent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long haul or feel comfortable or want to spend the night . <p> But there 's no chance of feeling comfortable yet . Nature abhors a vacuum but no one will speak . Not even the hopelessly old-fashioned lime jello and whipped cream parfaits provoke a laugh . At the very least , Iris thinks , they should know each other 's names , and so at her suggestion they go around the table and introduce themselves over the stringy roast beef and soggy green beans . Iris , Rich , Chuck , Deborah , Dick , Jim , Ginger , John , James , Bill , Tom , Jim , Stan , and Barbara . Small conversations limp along and are mercifully put out of their misery when the deputy sheriff announces it 's time . As the jury wends its way through the lunchroom , an attorney slips and falls while carrying a plate of beef stroganoff . The loose change in his hand showers Iris . He checks his shirt for stains , his twisted ankle be damned : juries do n't like spotty suits . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't much care for fancy suits , either . Tyrone 's lawyer is unfortunately one of a breed of lawyers which this type of predominantly white , not-too-educated jury tends to dislike . Because they 've lived their lives thinking people look down on them , they look down on other people first and fast . And Brewer definitely thinks he sits on a higher perch . He wears a different suit every day , his shirts are starched and ironed within a breath of perfection , and there 's the pesky problem of that pinky ring that shows to such advantage when he cocks his little finger to point . <p> Officer Bardwell 's hangdog look testifies to his remorse . He 's a tightly coiled spring of regret , basking in sorrow and doing his best to distance himself from his one false move . The defendant was selling drugs to some men in a car . His stash was in a bag of potato chips . Tyrone reached into the car with the bag of potato chips as if offering something to the men , then crumpled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolyard fence . Officer Bardwell and Jack observed the transaction from their stakeout on the third floor of the elementary school . They raced downstairs . Officer Bardwell confronted the defendant , thinking he would find some crushed green plant in the crumpled bag of potato chips . Jack came up behind the defendant . But the defendant was uncoopera-tire , and Officer Bardwell grabbed the defendant 's arm above the elbow . The defendant 's arm tensed , then relaxed , then tensed again , and that was when the scuffle began , he claims . There 's a Polaroid showing the bruise on Officer Bardwell 's chest where Tyrone Beasely elbowed him . Exactly where ? Both attorneys are very intent on this point ; the misdemeanor of elbowing becomes a felony when a cop is involved , and any death that occurs during commission of a felony becomes the felon 's fault . Legal mumbo jumbo makes this death Tyrone 's fault although he had no gun , but only if the bruise on Bardwell 's chest was caused by Tyrone 's elbow . So in fact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenario of murder by elbow . It is a point on which Officer Bardwell wo n't budge . <p> He bemoans his partner 's death . He blames himself , after Tyrone . He can relive it using words , but the real search is going on inside . When he sobs , great scoops of air pass up from his lungs . He was just doing his job the best he knew how , he says , his hands flopping through the air like big fish . Jack , wherever he is now , would be the first to understand that . Day in , day out , it 's stop this punk , nab that thief . The very pettiness of the quarry makes their crimes loom large , as if to dignify all the cops who build their days and nights around them . Saliva accumulates like sea froth in the corners of his mouth . <p> Ca n't get soft , because to hear tell , every punk they squeeze , every hood they hold , is some mama 's natural baby boy . But after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop a dope dealer up in this neighborhood , by tomorrow morning another one springs up on the south side that wants to try his hand , too . Knock out someone here , another one born overnight . Gets a nice steady rhythm to it , something you can count on , something as real and true as night follows day . And there 's never been a time when day followed day , at least in this latitude and longitude . <p> But look at it from the punk 's , the hood 's , the dealer 's point of view . What they do buys them a little pin money , that 's all . They 're not caught in the cogs of some corporation ; oh no , indeed , they could n't crawl or crowbar their way into any corporation . A big corporation takes one look at them and spits them out before breakfast . So what can they do ? They diddle , they dice , they deal . And they get caught , because that 's their job . It 's part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Several times a day the jury is ushered , under guard and on their honor , to the cramped jury room where they sit like sardines but are not , fourteen strangers , allowed to discuss the only thing they have in common . <p> Back and forth they ebb and flow , from jury room to jury box , from jury box home , from home back again to face another interminable stretch of testimony . Each morning they squeeze in , hoping this day is the last . Their patience feeds the testimony , the witnesses , the attorneys , makes this whole miracle of blind justice grind on , and each night they head for home , tired , confused , wondering how many more days they 'll miss from work , passing through the turnstiles and out to the street amidst the crowd of plaintiffs , attorneys , judges and deputies , applicants , supplicants , reporters and supporters , measuring time in the click of heels down corridors , the hum of elevators , the clacking of revolving doors . <p> The prosecution 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from a cage . Rico Robbins lives in jail ; he was only out on a brief probation vacation when the shooting took place , and now they 've clapped him back in the clink . He testifies willingly , under threat of death . He 's tall and thin , a bit birdlike , with a stringy black mustache and sparse goatee . He wears his best white rayon-blend jumpsuit and a gold chain around his neck . Cool pointy two-tone shoes . Before he testifies he sits in the holding cell , head in hands , wondering just how much his life expectancy will plummet after today . It was his luck to be the only eyewitness , in the wrong place at the wrong time . Wrong luck . <p> This man has nothing to gain , Mahoney intones . Trustworthy , he maintains . Treat me right , Tyrone prays . On the stand Rico Robbins nonchalantly , though not blithely , contradicts his grand jury testimony . Tyrone did n't touch Bardwell , he says . Tyrone was n't dealing drugs , he was eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends in a car , then stuffed the empty bag of potato chips beside the tree behind the schoolyard fence . When Bardwell confronted him , personal gun loaded and cocked , Tyrone had his hands over his head the whole time . The dead man had come up behind Tyrone , saw Bardwell with his gun out , and told him there was no need for it . Bardwell went to hit Tyrone over the head and his gun went off . Outraged , Mahoney sidesteps through this testimony at breakneck speed . Was n't it true that Rico knew Tyrone , that they were in the same jail after the shooting ? Did Tyrone threaten him to make him change his testimony ? <p> Brewer , when it 's his go , leisurely and lovingly dwells on every detail . If it had gone the other way , he would have ripped Rico to shreds . Justice sees right through you . No matter what Robbins says , no matter which way he goes , Mahoney and Brewer do n't care ; they 'll dish him out between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming he has nothing to gain by lying . Robbins is the one who 's squashed in the middle , at the end of the day he 's the one who 's dead meat no matter what he does . But he chooses to put his own neck in the noose and spare Tyrone 's . He 's not lying , he 's finally telling the truth . Did n't tell the truth before because some big bohunk cop put a .357 Magnum upside his head and told him to think twice before he said anything . Naturally , he did ; he thought long and hard , and at the grand jury he thought his real live memory right away . Shouting , shaking , Mahoney demands a recess . For Robbins it all ends not with a bang but a whimper . <p> Finally there 's nobody left to testify except the victim , and since Jack 's been dead for over a year now , Tyrone 's the next best thing . Iris is surprised to hear his voice because it is nice and soft with a pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tough , but once he talks she knows he 's innocent . He has the humility of a victim . Bardwell came toward him , screaming , Go ahead , run , make me shoot . Jack was behind Tyrone , and well known to him . Tyrone put his hands over his head , stepping back off the curb , trying to distance himself from that blue steel hole that chambered death . Jack spoke quietly to Officer Bardwell , urging him in the neutral syllables of restraint to put the gun away . When Tyrone is asked to show how Officer Bardwell approached him , he stands up and grabs his own belt buckle , digging his knuckles into his belly . No one would choose to show their vulnerability like that , Iris decides . His display reminds her of an animal in a submissive posture , exposing its belly to the oppressor to show it is n't a threat , serving life up as an offering to save life . <p> Instead , the bullet escaped and detoured its way to Jack 's lungs , eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compared to the majority of items in the universe , were too small to be of consequence , but put into the context of Jack 's life , were more than enough to destroy it . <p> Iris just now starts to get an idea of all the momentous events that must intermingle to forge a single breath , the melange of happenstance from everyone else 's life that triggers the events in your own , the daily hodgepodge , the weekly pastiche , the annual New Year 's Eve state-of-your-life chowchow of existence . <p> There is only one more witness , and because he can not testify until the next day the trial drags on into Friday . On Friday morning the judge calls Iris out and tells her she 's been excused from the jury since that evening is a religious holiday . Iris thinks briefly about protesting , but the judge has spoken with such finality , and Tyrone is so clearly innocent , that she doubts in the long run she 'll be missed . She is replaced by the first alternate , a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other jurors ply Iris , representative of her faith , the last of the just , with questions . At long last they have stumbled upon a neutral topic , one in which they can all take part . Iris explains that Rosh Hashanah begins the Ten Days of Repentance , the most solemn ten days at the head of the year , when God sits in judgment and decides who shall live and who shall die before the next Ten Days of Repentance . Three books are opened in the heavenly court : one for the wicked , one for the righteous , and one for those who are neither here nor there . The righteous get Life. , the wicked get Death , and those in between must work hard for the next ten days to show their worth through their deeds , for therein lies the key to sentencing . Repentance , prayer , and righteousness avert the severe decree . At the end of the ten days , on Yom Kippur , man must attempt to serve God as if he were one of the angels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wearing of sandals , and sexual intercourse are all forbidden . Only kings and brides may wash their faces ; only pregnant women and the ill may eat , and then only until they recover . <p> Iris stays as long as she can for the deliberations . She talks to the attorneys and the reporters , off the record . She hears all the evidence that the judge deemed unfit for the jury : that Jack 's widow is suing the city for allowing police to carry such light-triggered personal weapons as Officer Bardwell 's ; that Officer Bardwell was experiencing marital problems when the shooting occurred ; that Officer Bardwell had accidentally injured another partner some twelve years previously . But she must leave for services . She walks to her car in the garage across from the courthouse . She stops to get a newspaper . She sees something lying on the sidewalk beside a plastic bag , and she stops to take a closer look . It is a decapitated white- , black- and gold-leathered chicken . She can see where the neck-bone was severed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic bag . It is the chicken 's severed head . There is no blood anywhere . <p> That afternoon and evening constitute many hard hours for the lone black woman on the jury . She is the only one who is convinced that Tyrone is innocent , and in. the end , after ten hours of deliberation , she can not hold the fort on her own . The others on the jury sincerely doubt that a police officer would use unnecessary force . They doubt that a police officer would treat a man badly just because he happened to be black . In the end , sick to her stomach but doubting her own judgment , Tyrone 's lone black juror gives in and agrees to find him guilty . <p> When the verdict is read , Tyrone feels his body go boneless , the flesh shored up in strange ways to prevent him from seeping through the floor . He thought he could see with his heart , but he was wrong , and the truth is something so precious and secret that only he and Officer Bardwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , and it leaves his body and travels up above the earth and into the heavens to be ready to enter some newborn baby because Tyrone will never have need for a heart again . He will never feel the same , or trust another person , or love his children in quite the same way . <p> When she hears the news , Iris is stunned . All this time she 's only been dipping the tips of her toes in the high and low tide of justice , while Tyrone was thrown headfirst into the coldest , murkiest depths without a life jacket or rope or even a chance to register for swimming lessons . She was certain he was innocent . <p> Iris attends the sentencing the following month . No catchy phrases , no quick maxims . The minimum sentence is twenty years , and that 's what Tyrone is given . You can bring your mother and mister , the brothers and sisters ; family ties ca n't save you now . You 're all unsteady people , what-all , fodder . Got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you got to end up where all your kind ends up , in the slammer , the cooler , the big house , the clink . They 'll muzzle you , tether you , gag you with rules , but in the end it does n't matter . Because the warden is out for some blood , out for some revenge for his own wasted life and his faltering marriage and the son that 's ended up no better than the cons his daddy 's sick over having to spend his days with . <p> It does n't matter that a cop twists the truth so he can try to sleep nights because the day before he accidentally shot his partner he found his own wife in bed with their pastor , who was doubling as their marriage counselor . It does n't matter if a witness keeps quiet or talks . Because someone has to pay for a cop 's death , and that someone might as well be you . So chuck out your chin and come clean , and if you can grease someone 's palm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way out . Take the weight and do n't be late . And so Tyrone leaves his wife and children , his family and friends , and heads off to a very different life , a life where fear replaces love , where doom replaces promise . <p> Iris takes the subway home . Only the seat by the door is empty , and she sits there , collecting her thoughts . The conductor closes the doors . Smoking , littering , and radio-playing are not allowed on the train , the conductor intones . Three black teenagers stand by the door , hucking and jiving louder and louder . She is annoyed ' because everything is not hunky-dory , not okeydokey , and the noisier they get , the more she realizes the horrible mistake she 's made . The truth presses in on her more oppressively with each rising decibel . Between two stops , one of the teenagers lights a cigarette . <p> " You ca n't smoke here , " Iris says mechanically . The teenager laughs . " Put it out , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is breaking the rules which are clearly posted everywhere . The teenager puts out the cigarette and smirks at his companion . Iris ca n't believe she 's won so easily , and as it turns out she has n't , because when the door opens and the teenager and his friends gather up their backpacks and packages to leave , the boy who was smoking lingers a moment , purses his lips , and projects a huge gob of spit at Iris ' face . He and his friends spin out and the doors close . <p> She can hear her heart valves open and shut . Her fingernails continue to grow . Her breath flows in and out of her lungs . Everything works just as it should . The doors open and close smoothly , the train starts again without a hitch . Nobody on the train lifts a finger to help or comfort Iris , and she is once again alone , solitary defender of the faith . <p> <p> By JUDITH COOPER <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
