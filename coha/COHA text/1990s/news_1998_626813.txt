<p> IMAGINE turning down a pay raise or returning a Christmas bonus . You 'd never do that , right ? That would be like throwing away free money . <p> But if you 're not enrolled in your company 's 401(k) retirement savings plan , you should be now - or as soon as you are eligible , financial experts say . <p> It 's a no-brainer , said Robert Sheard , a Lexington-based writer for the Motley Fool , a free online investment-advice service at www.fool.com . The biggest mistake you can make with your 401(k) is to not sign up for it . <p> " That 's just free money you are giving away if you do n't take advantage of it , " he said . <p> If you 've never signed up for a 401(k) - 33 percent of eligible workers nationwide have passed up the opportunity - here 's how it works . <p> You save pretax income in your 401(k) account . This money comes directly out of your paycheck . Often , employers match - with cash or company stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain amount . That 's the free money . <p> Your 401(k) assets grow tax-free until it 's time to withdraw them , which you can do starting at age 59 1/2 . Take out funds earlier and you 'll face a 10 percent penalty and income taxes . <p> " No one can stress ( enough ) what a tremendous benefit it is to be involved in a 401(k) as far as the pretax contributions , the employer match and the tax-deferred growth , " said Teresa Jeter , financial adviser for Prudential Securities in Lexington , Ky . <p> Your company determines when you are eligible to sign up for a 401(k) . It 's often after six months or one year of service . <p> When you become vested also varies . Being vested means the matching money your employer contributes is all yours . <p> Some employers vest employees immediately after they enroll in the plan . Other employers vest under a graduated plan - or gradually , such as over five years . <p> A third method is called cliff vesting . That means employees are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then they are 100 percent vested . <p> Federal law allows you to sock up to $ 10,000 of your annual pretax income into your 401(k) accounts . At tax time you simply subtract the money you put into your 401(k) that year from your income . Plans usually allow employees who contribute the maximum amount of pretax dollars to also save post-tax income . <p> ( 1 ) Get the full match <p> Contribute the maximum amount that your employer will match , Jeter said . <p> " Budget for it . Consider it just like a bill and do it , " she said . " Do n't keep putting it off unless you are in god-awful debt and then you might not even consider retiring . " <p> Financial experts are split on whether those with high-interest credit card debt should participate in a 401(k) . Jeter thinks they should . <p> " I would much rather go ahead and contribute 2 more percent if that means getting the full match rather than taking that 2 percent and trying to pay off a credit card . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the employer match and the pretax contributions , " she said . " It 's kind of hard to draw the line as far as how much debt or how little debt ( you should have ) . But no matter what , you are going to have to have some savings for retirement . " <p> If your debt situation lands you in bankruptcy court , your 401(k) funds will be protected , unlike a regular savings account or an individual retirement account . But this should not be an incentive to file for Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy , which stays on your credit report for 10 years , Jeter said . <p> ( 2 ) Do n't invest too much <p> Do n't contribute any more income to your 401(k) than what your employer will match , Sheard said . That 's because most plans offer just a few investment options , not enough to have a diverse portfolio , he said . <p> Seventy-five percent of plans offer fewer than 10 investment vehicles , such as stock and bond funds , money market accounts and company stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buck Consultants , an international firm that monitors employee benefits and that annually surveys employers on their 401(k) plan practices . <p> ( 3 ) Choose index funds <p> Most plans do n't allow employees to pick individual stocks ; instead they permit a choice between mutual funds . And Sheard , author of " The Unemotional Investor " ( Simon &; Schuster , 1998 ) , is no fan of managed mutual funds . <p> Sheard suggests picking stock index funds if they are offered . These funds own stocks that make up stock indexes , such as the Dow Jones industrial average or the Standard &; Poor 's 500 . <p> " That 's the only way to go . If you look at actively managed funds , 80 percent lose compared to index funds every year , " Sheard said . " You will at least stay even with the market index . . . . It 's an easy way to get a diverse portfolio of large , American stocks . " <p> ( 4 ) When you switch jobs <p> Do n't cash out your 401(k) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a penalty and income taxes . Both Jeter and Sheard suggested rolling those funds into an IRA , not into your new employer 's 401(k) plan . An IRA will give you more choices of where and how to invest than 401(k) plans do . <p> " Do n't roll it over into a new 401(k) because you will just get more mutual fund choices , " Sheard said . <p> ( 5 ) Borrowing from your retirement <p> You can borrow from your 401(k) , but many financial planners and advisers do n't advise it . If you own a house and need money , you should go for a home equity loan , Jeter said . But if you do n't own a home and your 401(k) is your only source of funds , proceed with caution . <p> You first need to find out whether your company 's plan will allow you to continue making contributions while you are paying back the loan , Jeter said . If you ca n't , forget about borrowing . <p> " Think about all that money that , No. 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , No. 2 , you ( would be ) missing that employer match for all those years , " she said . <p> Jeter is not swayed by the fact that the interest you pay - typically prime rate plus 1 or 2 percent - actually goes back into your account . <p> " It sounds good , paying interest back to yourself when you are repaying . But really you 're getting double-taxed because when you repay your loan amount , that 's going to be after- tax dollars that you are putting back into your 401(k) and then when you take it back out at retirement . . . you are paying tax again , " she said . <p> She also advised against taking out a 401(k) loan if you plan on switching jobs in the near future . Your employer 's plan could force you to pay back the debt sooner than you planned . <p> ( 6 ) How aggressively to invest <p> If you 're in your 20s or 30s , do n't even think about bond funds . <p> " You want 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking stocks or stock funds , which over the long term offer double-digit growth , she said . <p> " The more years that you have to work with ( until retirement ) , the more aggressive you can be , " she said . " You know you can take a little bit more risk because long-term speaking you are going to be able to ride out any dips in the market and really get the growth you need to . " <p> Being too conservative is the second-biggest mistake young 401(k) investors make , behind not participating in the plan at all , she said . <p> In your 40s you might want to go with some bonds , but Jeter advises staying mainly with stocks . Things such as early retirement or getting a late start on saving for retirement also could factor into your decision on how aggressively you invest in your 401(k) . <p> But whatever you do , do n't pass up one of the biggest benefits your employer offers , says Jane Bryant Quinn in her updated version of " Making the Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Many young people avoid these plans because they ' ca n't afford ' them . But you gain so much in tax savings and , usually , free employer contributions that it 's crazy not to join . " <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @54982 <p> The news this summer was grim : The eight-county Houston area is the worst large urban area in the nation when it comes to medical coverage . An astounding 30 percent of people in the area are living without health insurance . <p> The reasons are many , but chief among them is cost . <p> " For the typical person in a low-income job who makes too much to qualify for Medicaid but whose employer does n't offer insurance , there just are n't a lot of options , " said Dianne Longley of the Texas Department of Insurance . <p> Most uninsured in Texas , she said , work at low-wage jobs that do n't provide benefits . Others are self-employed or between jobs , early retirees years away from Medicare or immigrants who do n't qualify for or are afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The cost of private health insurance coverage depends on a number of variables - gender , age , health , where you live , whether you smoke , number of dependents , the deductible level and type of coverage . There 's no such thing as a " typical " plan , but insurance agents say comprehensive family coverage can cost $ 300 to $ 400 a month . <p> One rule of thumb : The higher the deductible - the medical bills you must pay each year until coverage kicks in - the cheaper the monthly premiums . If cheap rates are your goal , Longley said , go for the biggest deductible you can afford . For example , increasing the deductible from $ 250 to $ 750 a year can save about $ 50 a month in premium costs on a typical plan . <p> To join the estimated 10 million people nationwide who depend on private insurance as their only form of health coverage , Longley has some tips . First and foremost , shop around , she advises . <p> Get at least three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparing prices , be sure to compare the same benefits . Use a broker or agent listed in the Yellow Pages or contact insurance companies directly . <p> Ask friends and family for recommendations . <p> Look into coverage offered by any trade or business association , church , bank or alumni group that you belong to . Often , you can pool your coverage purchasing power with others and get competitive rates that are similar to those offered through group plans . <p> Self-employed people or those who work for small employers who do n't offer insurance should look into new , tax-deductible medical savings accounts . The program lets participants couple a trust or custodial account with a low-premium , high-deductible plan that protects against catastrophic illness . Money put in the account as a monthly premium can go toward day-to-day medical expenses not covered by the policy . Ask an insurance agent . <p> Consider catastrophic coverage , which protects only against drastic , hospital-related costs for serious illnesses such as cancer or heart disease . These policies can feature deductibles as high as $ 10,000 or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other basic coverage . But they may be a good idea for people who are young , healthy , childless and ca n't afford any other kind of health coverage , said Longley . They can reduce premiums by as much as 30 percent to 50 percent . <p> Other insurance options include : <p> Enroll in college . At the University of Houston , students taking at least six semester hours pay $ 595 a year for coverage that includes $ 5 visits to the campus clinic with no deductibles , no lab or X-ray costs and $ 10 prescriptions . ( You do , however , have to pay $ 586 in average tuition costs per semester . ) For an additional $ 88 per semester , students can purchase a major medical option that provides up to $ 150,000 in coverage in case they get seriously sick or hurt in an accident . The plan does n't include dependent coverage . <p> Those who have quit their job or been fired ( as long as it was n't for " gross misconduct " ) can continue on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Congressional Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act , or COBRA . The catch : You must pay the entire premium - the employer share and the employee share - plus a 2 percent administrative fee . <p> Texas recently formed a " high-risk " pool to help people who are without insurance because of pre-existing health problems . To be eligible , a person must have been turned down for coverage by at least two companies , offered insurance at higher rates than those offered by the pool , or offered coverage that excludes the pre-existing health problem . Dependents can join , too . <p> But it 's not cheap . Premium rates are 37 percent higher than typical individual plan rates , said Catherine Coleman of Blue Cross Blue Shield , which administers the pool . For example , a 40- to 44-year-old non-smoking male in Houston ( one of the most expensive areas ) would pay a $ 221 monthly premium , with a $ 500 deductible . <p> " This is designed for people who ca n't get insurance because of illness , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> So far , only 1,400 people have signed up for the pool . <p> For information , call toll-free 888-398-3927 . <p> Coverage for children <p> An estimated 1.3 million Texas children - that 's one in four - lack health coverage . Among new programs to reduce the number : <p> Until recently , Medicaid covered children only up to age 14 , said Hoxi Jones-Carranza , public information officer for the Texas Department of Human Services . But this summer , benefits were extended to include children up to age 18 through a federally funded program called Children 's Health Insurance Plan . <p> " This is going to initially cover an additional 63,000 children by the end of 1998 statewide , " she said . <p> To qualify for government-subsidized care , families must earn at or below federal poverty guidelines - for a family of four , $ 16,450 a year . In 1997 , 226,644 families and individuals were eligible for Medicaid in Harris County . <p> For information , call 713-767-2000 . <p> The Texas Healthy Kids Corp . will subsidize low-cost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups . Depending on their income , parents will pay $ 10 to $ 50 a month per child ages 2-17 for comprehensive health care . The nonprofit group 's plan targets those who ca n't get insurance through their employers but ca n't afford private coverage . <p> " The benefits focus on things kids need to learn well in school , " said Laura Lawlor , associate director . Included are well-child visits , immunizations , eye glasses , hearing tests and dental coverage . Enrollment begins in Houston on Sept. 15 . <p> For information , call 800-943-KIDS . <p> Some insurance companies now offer plans under which children can be insured alone . Under the Blue Cross Blue Shield plan , for example , the rate is $ 47 a month with a $ 250 deductible for a girl age 5-12 . Benefits include well-child care . The premium can go as low as $ 18 a month - if the parents can handle an $ 8,000 deductible . <p> NOTES : To learn more about buying individual health insurance , call the Texas Department of Insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet site at www.tdi.state.tx.us.
