The gray is terminal this time of year . The tourists cleared out months ago , leaving us islanders to find one another in the barren streets , exchange pleasantries , then wander home . I drive into Vineyard Haven for my morning cup of jumpstart , while the ferry 's moan pushes through the damp air . Somnabulant , the winter months pass . <p> On my way to Joe 's Fish and Chips , I wave to Sadie Thompkins . With her short leg and her big shoe , she stomps defiantly toward the health food store . <p> " Any strong jades ? " I call across the street . Sadie manages the plant nursery in Oak Bluffs . <p> " I 've been pruning one special for you , Sis . I 'll bring it over on <p> my next visit . " <p> My name is Josephine , but everyone calls me Sister . <p> I smile , tip my baseball cap , and turn the diner 's greasy doorknob . <p> He 's at the counter . I pass by and smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stops talking to Joe , bends <p> his head into his mug . The way we do n't look at each other is an act of recognition : Hello . We walk the widest circle of a bull's-eye around one another : How do you do ? At opposite ends of the room , we sip the same black coffee , at the same time . <p> Two cups later , I watch his reflection in the window , bundling up for the cold , a tangle of light brown hair resisting his wool hat . His shoulders are rounded when he turns stiffly to head out the door . <p> The spine reveals it . The vertebrae pay for life 's hard knocks . <p> My morning 's free , and my lunch hour 's three-long , since there are n't many people who appreciate a massage on a full stomach . But I do n't mind missing the business . The tourists gave me enough acorns to go easy until spring , when they 'll start scurrying in again . I cut my rates in half during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the upkeep on the cottage that my parents left me . <p> One mug later , my belly is so full of steam I could lift off . I shift into four-wheel drive and get the most of my old Japanese junker with nearly bald tires . At Lambert 's Cove I walk until the slow anchor of sand fills my shoes . Then I just sit and watch the water wash over stones , smooth and trouble-free . <p> The teapot is just beginning to squeal when Squid shows up . " Howdee , " I call , shaking Harold Waller 's firm , warm hand . A bunch of us went fishing for blues one day . You can guess what Waller caught . The nickname stuck . <p> " I 'm gon na give your fingers a workout today , " he says . " Something 's knotted up fierce . " A smile pushes his pudgy , velvet face up over his eyes . <p> " I love a challenge . " I leave the room so Squid can strip . We talk through the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemon water . " Your pain is the P.O. job . The way you 've got things rigged up , you walk around misshapen as the packages you bring me . Backpack or bust , Squid . That 's where you 're at . " I smack my lips together . " Y'all set ? " <p> " The fish flops , " he says . The weight of his body pushes into the cushion of the table with a hiss . <p> I put Patsy Cline in the cassette player  --  Squid 's pick  --  and rub homemade massage oil between my hands to warm everything up . I go out walkin ' Patsy sings , and Squid 's feet begin shuffling in the air . They are tough , yellow , and calloused . Even so , his roundness and gentle movements make him look like an enormous baby waiting to be turned and diapered . <p> " This is n't dance class . You 've got ta relax if you want me to do any good . " <p> " Okay , boss , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . I pull my hands along the expanse of his shoulders ; they release and relax . The ritual has begun . <p> As a client , Squid is one of my favorites . I 've got to work hard to get through the blubber , but there 's always an unlocking . I know I do him good . <p> " This is it , " I whisper fifteen minutes later , battling a knotted gluteus medius . His body winces . I work it for a few seconds then turn to relaxing the area before burrowing in again . My fingers move in small circles , inching out farther and farther . He exhales deeply several times . He is working with me . <p> Half an hour later there is the quick chirp of Squid 's fly zipping . <p> " I do n't know what happened , but you 've got a knot the size of a sand dune . It 's loosened up now so take it easy , and come back this time tomorrow , my treat , and we 'll level you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " Now get out of here . I 've got ten minutes to get ready for a new client . " <p> " Tell me the zip code , and let me guess who it is . " <p> " Some carpenter named Dylan . Now out . " <p> " 02557 , and he 's a weird one . Sort of a loner . Mail-orders everything , as far as I can tell : power tools , fish food , Bengay by <p> the case  --  he must be in bad shape . I 'm sure he 'd order his lunch Fed Ex if it could arrive at noon . " " Out ! " I shoo him toward the door . <p> I listen to the sound of Squid 's mail truck grinding into the pebbled path . <p> The pebbles were the drum roll to our arrival each summer . The final gearshifting into park , a cymbal crash to stillness . For a moment my parents and I just sat there hoping for something more from one another . <p> Twenty minutes later I open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into his F150 pickup . It 's what I expect from the man whose voice I know only as a mumble rebounding off the back wall at Joe 's . <p> When he is seated behind the wheel he sees me . He stares for a minute , then , begrudgingly , gets out again . <p> " I did n't think anyone was home , " he talks to the driveway , on his way to the doorstep . <p> " Maybe I did n't hear your knock . I was stoking the stove . " I grin and turn my face to look down the road . I can tell he wo n't look at me otherwise . He looks . <p> " I 'm still deciding if I want to try this on the mess of tendinitis <p> I 've got , " he scowls . " I 'm not into crystals and hocus-pocus . " <p> I look him in the eyes  --  " Neither am I "  --  then turn away again . We stand in silence . " Give me a shot . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , leaving the front door wide open . <p> He does n't move . <p> " I spent the last twenty minutes building this fire so it would be warm in here for you , " I call from the kitchen . " You 're letting in all the cold air . " <p> The porch door squeaks , the front door smacks into the jamb , and the thud of work boots beat against the hallway mat . <p> When he enters the kitchen , I am seated at the table with two full shot glasses and a bottle of peppermint schnapps . " I do n't usually recommend this , but I think we could use a little help relaxing . " I lift my glass and smile . " Skoal . " <p> " Skoal , " he says . We throw our heads back . <p> " I 'm Sister . " I extend my hand . <p> " Dylan . " He smiles , we shake . <p> " Nice grip , " I say , leading him into the massage room . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist and legs . I 'll talk through what I 'm doing this time , and let him know when I feel anything problematic . " We 'll focus on the tendinitis , " I say , leaving the room . <p> When I enter again he is half-naked , V-shaped , opalescent in the dim light . " You 're a carpenter . " <p> " Finish work , " his cushion-muffled voice replies . <p> " I recognize the muscle development . Your shoulders are probably tensed when you work . You might think about it next time you swing a hammer . " I push two fingers lightly into the tendons around his forth and fifth lumbar vertebrae . His body shudders . His skin is smooth elastic . <p> " I 'm guessing you know how to lift properly , you just do n't do it often . That contributes to this overstrained area , and to the overdevelopment in your trapezius , deltoid , and lats . " I touch his neck , shoulders , upper sides . . . <p> At night I sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel rooted , looking at patches of grass , brilliant beneath moonglow , and mud pools of rainwater that reflect the stars . Sometimes I can see Orion 's reflection in the pond in front of my property , earthbound as the boulders that line it . I imagine the pond a moat , and the hunter the savvy guard who keeps me safe . Tonight is one of those when he swaggers up my gnarled lawn , unties the bandanna from his neck , and gags me . I do n't resist him . Speaking means little to me , anyway . What does he think I might say ? <p> When I go inside I sit on the overstuffed sofa my mother had poised herself upon , day after day , chain-smoking , sinking into the quicksand of pillows . Her body was the gnomon of a sundial . Only her shadow moved . <p> My father spent most of his vacations bent over the roll-top desk he made in vocational high school . A skyscraper of bookkeeping at his side , he spent hours breaking pencil points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the phone at the dry-cleaning chain 's manager , Maury , in New York . <p> Afterwards he 'd slam down the phone receiver and turn towards my mother , his hands flying into the air like a shot of helium . " How 's a man supposed to support his family with a bunch of incompetents supporting him , " he would barrel , kicking over the kingpin in an arrangement of empty Ballantine cans . <p> With a tick in her jaw , she blew a final stream of smoke into the air , put down her cigarette , blinked quickly three or four times . Her stillness was a prayer . <p> " Well ? ! " he shrieked . <p> It was a losing crapshoot . <p> Hours later I wake up , my face sweating into the couch 's lap . <p> Each morning I head over to Joe 's , where I 'm delivered to a steaming , oily cup of black java love . Today I 'm wearing my canvas fishing hat , a headdress of feathered flies . I always wear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brim shades my bloodshot , half-closed eyes . <p> Squid honks at me from his spanky little mail truck , startling me . He laughs loudly from the well of his belly . I keep my head down and give him the finger . He laughs again . <p> I 'm on Joe 's slate pathway when two work boots step in front of me . " Excuse me , " I mumble , and try to walk around them . <p> He bends his knees and peers under my cap . " Hey , Sister . " <p> My stomach jumps . He smiles timidly . <p> " Dylan , I 'll consider you Satan if you keep me from the only trustworthy form of worship I know . " <p> " I 'm sore as shit today , " he says , his expression souring . His body is so mentholated that my eyes sting . <p> " Good . " I fake to the left , then stumble around him to the right . I open the door to the blinding fluorescent brightness and the earthy scent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steaming mug is awaiting . <p> Two cups later , I wonder why Dylan sets me on edge . I try to read the coffee grounds I 'm left with . They are silent , motionless , unyielding . <p> It 's a rock-garden day ; there 's no getting past it . Some people call it the blues , and I know I 'm lucky to have rocks to rake through , smoothing the surface for me . I drive home and head to the back of the property . There 's something about planting a rock in the earth . It 's a blossom in perpetual bloom . Something you can count on . <p> My rock gardening began when my parents sent me to boarding school . My father considered my time in Pennsylvania private schools a sign of his good fortune . No matter how hectic things were at the dry-cleaning stores , he always made it to Grand Central in time to wave goodbye ; it was an event that filled a second-generation Irish immigrant with pride . <p> Each year I combed Amish country for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mundane ; and the crippled , jagged mutts of I do n't know what , that had no surface that would lie flat against the earth . At my hidden spot in the woods I carved jagged beds for them in the ground , and like the crooked spines I see now , offered them their first moments of relief . <p> When Squid comes , I ask him if we can leave the music off-today . He looks at me sweet and dumb and says whatever you like . Things proceed the usual way : the curtains drawn , the dimmed light inoculating us . I coax the core of his spasm into dissolution . When he 's dressed , he swings his arms in the air , squeals at the looseness , and hugs me . I do n't do this . My feet lift off the ground . There is a breathless , unfamiliar squeak as the blood rushes into my face . Please leave , I think . <p> When he is outside , he waves with a big marsupial smile . The next few mornings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be in a polite state of wake-up when Dylan arrives . I want to apologize for my spitfire . <p> He does n't show . <p> Day four , I scribble on a paper doily map of the island : <p> Four coffee black mornings tell me Satan has perished . My conscience is hell . Redeem this message for a massage . Soreness is a sign I can help you . Infernally yours , Sister <p> I draw a pitchfork on the spot of West T is where my house is , write his name in big letters on the back , and tack it onto Joe 's door on my way out . <p> Two nights later I find a fresh pile of carpenter 's scraps on my wood heap with a note . " For the Inferno . Is tomorrow at 4:30 okay ? " <p> Yes ! <p> At night , the wind whistles through my house . I stoke the stove with one-by-fours , then raise a bottle of J &B; and toast to " possibilities , " with a marble-eyed moon for company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire , Orion returns . He 's just about to gag me when an ember sparks from the fireplace , singeing the hair on my wrist . " Christ ! " I sit up quickly , then wait to catch my breath . I wash off my face and walk out back to sit with my rocks and stare at the moon , until I am so filled with its whiteness , that I , too , am as good as marble . Then I know I 'll be able to sleep . <p> The next day , Sadie comes over for her midmorning biweekly with a tall , narrow gift . <p> " Is it a needle full of sugar , Sugar ? " <p> " No , " she says , feigning disappointment . <p> " A foot-long frankfurter ? " <p> " Oh no . " I 'm getting colder . <p> " Is it green and spiky ? " <p> " Yes . " She waves her hands madly like we 're playing some TV game show . <p> " A six-pack of Heinie in bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she shouts back with equal fervor , making the two of us liars just for the fun of it . We high-five with both hands , then <p> dance in place like football players . <p> When we go inside I place the jade plant on the kitchen table . It 's straight and forgiving as a baby 's spine . <p> " It was no easy task to keep such a peculiar one from the green grasp of your gentleman caller , " Sadie says , looking at me funny . Inspecting me . <p> " Who are you talking about ? " <p> " Dylan , " she grins . <p> " Jesus , Sadie , he 's a client , " I say , feeling the heat flare in my face . <p> She just looks at me , all small-town snoopiness . <p> " What ? ! " <p> " Look , Sister , what I know is that he buys nearly every broken and drying botanical nightmare I have , and nurses them to new shoot and flower . Hell , he could put me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in it for a little green love . It 's all <p> over the way he prunes a leaf , creates a cutting . This is botanical insight , so trust me . He 's not just coming to you because of some twisted muscle . He 'd rather look like me than ask for help . " She does her best , with one clumsy platform shoe , to imitate a vaudevillian 's two-step . <p> Then  --  before I am speechless  --  Sadie lifts the jade and puts it on the windowsill . " Peachtree loves direct sunlight . " <p> " Peachtree ? " I say , relieved by the conversation 's curve . <p> " You 'd be amazed what head games get you in the plant world . " She tells me about some narcissus she named and treated like sunflowers . They grew two feet tall . <p> Sadie has broad shoulders , a whale-bone waist , and endless hips . She gives my fingers the gift of curves . I work her out in figure eights . It almost puts me in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls her hips swaddlers . " He likes them , too , " she smiles , then winks at me . <p> We high-five again before she leaves . My day is off to a good stats . <p> I go to Gayhead to celebrate . The lapping Atlantic offers everything here another chance ; it washes away the shoreline and returns the congealing sediment in new forms . In the gray , green , and red marbled day , I see my mother 's tired eyes closing , the creases fading with each rush of salt water . Etched into the cliffs above are her riddled , bony fingers , and the bulging vein in <p> my father 's temple . Here I can see it 's only a matter of time before they dissolve . It 's a place that fills me with hope . Build . Rebuild . <p> I wet my hands in the ocean , dig a finger into the serrated green clay , and reach behind my neck to paint a small stripe where spine meets cranium . My beach baptism . I carry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman and free . <p> Before Dylan arrives I take a long hot bath that mists the room so I do n't exist . <p> Ten minutes later I answer the door , steam-flushed and squeaky clean . <p> " How ya doin ' ? " He looks at me as he walks up the slate path to my doorstep . <p> " Swell . " I flash a grin . <p> He jaunts right by me and begins undressing . <p> " You look happy , " I call from my place in the kitchen , over the rustle of heavy work clothes . <p> " Just general good will , " he calls back , as one boot falls to the ground , " and I guess a little enthusiasm about the magic you 're trying to work on my shoulder . " The other boot falls . <p> " Dylan , is that a vote of confidence ? " <p> " Nope . Just enthusiasm . C'm on in . " <p> He is lowering to meet the table 's flannel cover when I enter . His chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between my hands , he rolls his head over and looks at me like a question . I wait . He is silent as a magnifying glass , and fixed on me as a beam of light . " Hit the pillow , soldier , " I nearly shout . I hit the dimmer and thank God that Dylan is face down again . " We 'll see what we can do here . " I begin . Skin to skin . <p> The short ends of one-by-fours show up on my firewood pile in the middle of the week and again at the week 's end . I live in a wool sock , my house is so warm . I crack the windows to feel the slap of life 's edge , and watch the pot of water endlessly boiling on the wood burner . <p> When Dylan comes back a week later I am in short sleeves  --  my way of saying thank you . As soon as he is inside and has finished stomping off the frost and frozen mud , he rubs his arms and smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek dimples . He understands . <p> I show him the spiky-leafed dracaena I bought from Sadie in honor of heat . I tell him I call it Palm Tree . He looks at me amused and perplexed , then gently touches one of the plant 's spiky fingers . I stay by the fire while he goes to undress . The crackle of heat is sweet music . <p> " Okay , " he says , and awakens me . <p> I give everybody a variation on the same routine ; it 's what I get back that changes : with Squid it 's rolly flesh and success ; with Sadie it 's meditation . When I put my fingers on Dylan 's back ... I feel like we are speaking . Only it 's confusing as whale calls . For a while I try to understand . I watch the give and resistance , and nearly say , " What is it ? , " but instead close my eyes . My hands move gently around his shoulder . His body twitches then relaxes . I understand his pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open my eyes I watch the shadow of his body rise and fall . And then I am breathing with him . <p> When he leaves he looks at Palm Tree over my shoulder and asks if he can drop by for a drink on Friday . <p> " Oh , " is all I can say . " I mean . . . " he begins , and is speechless . <p> " That sounds great , pal . " I punch him in the arm . " Yeah . My schedule 's open as an empty dumpster , " I say , thinking , What a dumb , dumb thing to say . I walk him out and sit on the step to watch him pull into the darkening night . <p> " Same time next week ? " he calls from his rolled-down window when he 's on the road again . <p> " You got it , " I call back and wave . " And Friday ? " I say confused . <p> " Friday . Yeah . . . yes , " he calls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in with a mutilated African violet . He thrusts it towards me , then sits on the sofa in front of the stove . " Henrietta , " he says defiantly . I take this to mean he dislikes my pet names . Then , with a look of better judgment , he takes the plant from me and places it in front of the living-room window which faces south . Its bigger leaves are brown-spotted and eaten in several places , but the young , sprouting leaves are rich in color and fur . There are two little white , wilted blooms . " Direct sunlight , water biweekly , watch for spiders , " he says , looking into the fire . <p> I say thanks , this is very kind of you . Then move to stoke the stove , asking if he wants something to drink , how his day went , if it 's warm enough in here for him . His answers are invisible ink : they dry quickly , and are gone . I pour him a shot of the sake I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him if he likes sake . He just sits there staring at the moldings bowed around the windows and doors , and mumbles about how it 's best to work a house around , not from , the trees it 's made of . <p> I think about this , then say , " It 's an old house . " <p> We sip in silence . The bones of the house creak around us , arthritic and busy as wringing hands . " Hopefully it 's not making plans to leave without us , " I joke , and he looks at me as if he were waiting for the end of my sentence . I do n't know what he thinks I might say . <p> We sit and sip . <p> " So how long have you been doing this ? " he asks . <p> I tell him I 've been drinking hot sake for years . <p> He nods . <p> " How ' bout you ? " I say . And when he says , " What ? , " the warmth in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's openhanded  --  answer the question any way you please . " He says , " Okay , " tilts his head down , and then pauses before out of the side of his mouth he says , " Henrietta needs to be watered twice a week . " We sit in silence for a long time . I lift the flask and look at him . He raises his glass for the filling . " Good , " we say at the same time , and chuckle . Then it 's old bones again . We watch the fire and blink loudly . <p> When he puts his cup down and says thanks , that he 's got to be going , I say that sounds like a tree joke , and reach for his coat . We 're both sake-flushed . I bow Japanese-style . He backs out of the door glassy-eyed , a crooked front tooth revealed in smile , beautiful , resting on his bottom lip . <p> The first snow begins to fall , filling the spaces in the landscape like a great equalizer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass , onto the thin ice which covers creeks still running underneath . I go out to look at the scarred earth where my rocks are laid and see impressions of tiny angels : vacant , frozen spaces . <p> After we 'd packed up the car , and were ready to head back to the city , my parents would send me into the house to make sure we did n't leave anything behind . Every room was perfectly untouched : the trash of my father 's business gone , and with it his countless cans of beer and my mother 's spawning piles of cigarette butts ; her well-worn spot on the sofa had been beaten into oblivion . The dust of quietude drifted through the air and settled gently around the room . <p> Everything inside of me settled , too . I 'd just stand in the living-room doorway until they honked the horn , probably never more than a few seconds , then I 'd run out to the car , the breeze splashing across my face , and open the door to the slap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments in the house each year were the only ones when I did n't know I was alone . <p> With my finger , I trace the rigid , icy shape of the angels in front of me , and realize that they flew away long ago . The crackling in my ears begins , then a tremor in my shoulders before I give into grief . <p> The days go by , business as usual . I spend my spare time at Gayhead , Lucy V , and Squibnauket , watching the migrating sand , the sway of razor grass . It quiets me to know I ca n't roar louder than the ocean . I think about things that are n't spoken . I watch tree limbs become driftwood and imagine our bodies turning gray and stiff . I shrug my shoulders and feel the pinch of a knot . <p> A week later Dylan arrives with a lively step . He smiles and looks me square in the face . Then , to my feet , he says , " It 's happening . . . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping . " He tilts his head to look up at me . <p> Our eyes lock . The muscles in his face drop and stiffen . This will be his last visit . <p> I exhale quietly . " Did you really doubt it ? " <p> " You bet I did , " he says , grinning , and begins unbuttoning his shirt . I look at the ground and leave . <p> When I come back there is nothing but the clean scent of his skin , and the way it feels : smooth as assurance , foreboding as the invisible walls when I turn off the lights . When I touch him my fingers skate on ice . Not that it 's more than a frost  --  something tender as snowflakes underneath . For a moment , I hear nothing but the frozen , easy breathing of my rocks out back . <p> <p> By JANE BUCHBINDER <p>
