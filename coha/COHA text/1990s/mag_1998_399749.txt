The Coen brothers strike again with The Big Lebowski , a scattershot upfrom-the-gutter comedy with style to spare . by Owen Gleiberman // THE BEAUTIFUL SCAM that opened Joel and Ethan Coen 's Fargo-the disclaimer that passed off the movie as a true story-was more than a stunt . It forced the Coen brothers to discipline themselves as moviemakers . In order to seduce us into believing that the events in the film might actually have taken place , they had to hold back on their favored style of manic overkill : the gymnastic camera movements and wide-angle acting , the dialogue that 's too enamored of its own absurdist cleverness . The very title of The Big Lebowski ( Gramercy ) announces that the Coens are now back to their old hyperbolic tricks . They give us a hero , Jeff Lebowski ( Jeff Bridges ) , who 's a walking one-liner , a slovenly , longhaired dropout from the stoned ' ' 70s who dresses in stained T-shirts and plaid shorts , smokes doobies and guzzles White Russians , and insists on being called " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dude hang out at the local bowling alley along with his derelict pals , notably Walter ( John Goodman ) , a high-strung Vietnam vet who screams obscenityspiked lines like a psychotic drill sergeant and turns out to beget ready to plotz with laughter-an observant Jew . ( " I do n't bowl on Shabbes , " he announces matter-of-factly . ) We see the Dude mistaken for another Lebowski , a tycoon in a wheelchair ( David Huddleston ) who also yells a lot ( the Coens are nothing if not fond of apoplectic power mongers ) . When this other Lebowski , the " big " Lebowski , discovers that his young porno-doll wife has been abducted , he enlists the Dude to deliver a million dollars to the kidnappers . Photograph LOSERS ' LANE : Bridges , Goodman , and Steve Buscemi get bowled over // Virtually every Coen film has been structured as some sort of convoluted funhouse ride , and The Big Lebowski , with its hippie-out-of-time protagonist , wants to be a byzantine trip movie , an underworld-scuzz version of Alice in Wonderland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the cash , a plan that 's destined to go horribly awry . This leads the Dude into confrontations with assorted wacko deviants . There 's Lebowski 's fake-aristo artist daughter ( Julianne Moore , stretching out her vowels to the breaking point ) , as well as a trio of castrating German brutes known as the Nihilists . In an amusingly unhinged scene , these cartoon nasties let a marmot loose in the Dude 's bathwater , but otherwise they seem little more than a gloss on Mike Myers ' Dieter from Saturday Night Live . The Coens do n't stop there . They throw in deliberately corny **27;328;TOOLONG acid flashbacks , John Turturro as a macho Spanish freak in a hairnet , David Thewlis as a giggling ninny with a John Waters mustache , and endless , dancing shots that loop and glide down the bowling lanes , tracing the pins as they fly , the candy-colored balls as they take their ritualized journey ... Nearly everything in The Big Lebowski is a put-on , and all that leaves you with is the Coens ' bizarrely over-deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the film itself were standing off to the sidelines , saying " Look , is n't this a hilarious concept ? " The Coens do n't create jokes , exactly-they create ideas for jokes . Still , you can see what they 're after . There 's one sequence that blasts right into the ozone of silliness-a Busby Berkeley-goes-bowling musical number choreographed to Kenny Rogers singing " Just Dropped In ( To See What Condition My Condition Was In ) . " But the Coens " touch is rarely that light . It would have helped if Bridges ' performance were wilder his demeanor is actually too straight to do justice to the Dude 's shaggy-dog effluence . Bridges looks so funky here you can almost smell him , but aside from dropping an occasional " far out , man , " he just sounds like good old wry , savvy Jeff Bridges . The very notion that the Dude takes in the world from a different latitude never quite comes across . Like Fargo and Raising Arizona , The Big Lebowski poses as a cracked tribute to middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are sanctified by their knuckleball eccentricity . Yet this stab at gonzo humanism just seems another put-on , since , in the Coens ' films-Fargo is the rare exception-the characters are all but defined by their plastic separation from each other . In The Big Lebowski , even the Dude spews dialogue like a human tickertape machine , and too many scenes rely on such barely ironic jokes as John Goodman smashing a Corvette with a crowbar . The Coens ' most prominent talent is for smashing everything in their path , only their tool of choice is mockery It 's a tool that , with terminal perversity , they 're only too happy to turn on their own movies .
