Sidebar Freezing a Berry Bonanza Place berries on a cookie sheet or baking tray so they are n't touching . Freeze for about 1 hour , or until they 're almost frozen . Place in a zip-close plastic bag and freeze for up to 6 months . ( If your cookie sheet is wide , put it in the freezer first and then add the berries . ) With this technique , you wo n't end up with a huge frozen mass , and you can later eat or cook with as many , or as few , as you like . Or just eat the berries frozen-they make a luscious snack . Never thaw berries before using them in a recipe ; they 'll become mushy .
