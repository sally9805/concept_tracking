Fishermen who love big water , but lack the patience to work it by traditional trolling tactics , can beat the deep-water doldrums by using diving planers . These can virtually double your trolling area without doubling your efforts or cost . Diving planers do n't need to be used with special line ( such as wire or lead core ) , expensive accessories ( such as downriggers ) , or heavy weights . And some planer models can be adjusted to cover a wider swath of water than other trolling methods . Diving planers attach to fishing line a few feet ahead of a lure , and dive deeply when pulled through the water . Although most diving planers are weighted and sink at rest , no additional weights are needed to get the lure down ; the resistance of the planer makes it dive . And when a fish strikes the trailing lure , it trips a release that stops the diver from planing . All diving planers are designed to run straight behind a boat . Some planers , called directional divers , can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boat , expanding the lure 's area of presentation . Diving planers are available in a number of brands and sizes , and I suggest referring to the manufacturer 's recommendations ( usually supplied in chart form on the packaging ) to get the best results . Be sure to use the appropriate line-tie settings if applicable ( some have shallow- and deep-water settings ) , and set the planer the proper distance behind the boat . You can not estimate the amount of line let out , but must use the pull or pass system of line-length determination ( see sidebar ) . It 's important to know how much line is set out in order to gauge relative diving depth , especially for resetting after catching fish . Diving planers are n't magic , of course . In order to work they must be fished at the right depths with the right rods , line , and lures . When you have no clue as to how deep a planer is diving or if you need to confirm depth , based on the manufacturer 's instructions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Measure the amount of line out at that point ! " The size of the planer , the speed of the boat , and the size of the line may a feet depth , so a bit of experimentation may be necessary . Keep in mind that directional divers do not run as deep to the side as when trolled straight back if the same amount of line is used . Diving planers come in assorted shapes and sizes . The larger models run deepest , pull hardest , and require stouter tackle . These are best for big salmon , big lake trout , and sometimes striped bass . For shallower , smaller , and spookier fish , such as walleyes and brown trout , try smaller planers and lighter line . Planers also come in various colors , which can work as fish attractors . Pink or red seems to be a universal favorite , but bright green and yellow are also popular . Ultimately , of course , the lure catches the fish , and that 's where you need to focus most of your concern about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind diving planers vary . Many trollers use spoons and cut plugs . Minnow-imitating plugs of various sizes also get the nod , as do flies or a squid rigged behind a dodger . Diving plugs are not usually chosen unless they are shallow runners and can withstand sometimes erratic planer action . Some planers flip over and rise when fished with deep-diving or heavy lures . Four to 6 feet is the common setback from planer to lure . You need a relatively short distance between the two , because of the difficulty of netting a fish that is 5 or more feet behind a planer . Leader strength should equal or exceed that of the main line . Diving planers are fished with level-wind ( or heavy-duty bait-casting ) reels off of very stout rods , because they pull hard when trolled . On big boats , beefy 9- and 10-foot rods are used ; 7- or 8-footers on smaller boats . Lighter tackle may be used with the smallest planers . Rods are placed in holders , which must be able to withstand a lot of torque . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of the transom , with rods angled low  --  parallel if possible , but no more than 45 degrees . Diving planers are fished with relatively heavy nylon-monofilament lines ( 17-to 30-pound-test ) ; and some anglers use wire line because its low-stretch strength increases hookups . I 've been experimenting with small-diameter braided lines and have found that they have high strength and negligible stretch , although you must watch out for decreased abrasion resistance . Salmon and steelhead are the primary species sought by diving-planer trollers , but trout , walleyes , stripers , and some saltwater fish are also good candidates . Trolling depths vary according to species or season . I recently used diving planers when fishing for lake trout in 65 feet of water , but at another time and place the same fish might have been holding at 25 feet . If you have n't used diving planers before , you 'll be skeptical at first , but you 'll become a believer with the first jolting strike  --  and it wo n't take much time for that . THE PLANER FACTS DETERMINING LINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increment and count pulls , or the number of passes of the line guide on the reel after measuring how much line comes off with each full pass . EXTRA ATTRACTION : * Try placing a big planer 2 feet behind a small dodger with a spoon , fly , or squid rig trailing 3 to 4 feet behind . EXTRA PROTECTION : * For hard-striking fish , try a 5- to 8-inch rubber snubber behind the diver to minimize breakoffs . DISADVANTAGES : * It can be a nuisance to fight a fish with a tripped planer on the line , as it detracts from the fight of smaller fish and makes netting more troublesome . Sometimes it 's too hard to trip the release of a deep-diving planer and you really have to pull , which is n't always fun . Also , actual depth is harder to gauge with diving planers than with downriggers .
