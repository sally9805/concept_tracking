Evolution of an Art Form <p> No matter how many times I visit the nine gallery rooms at Genesee Country Museum 's John L. Wehle Gallery of Sporting Art in Mumford , with each new visit I continue to make new discoveries and learn more about sporting and wildlife art . <p> Recently , for example , while gazing at an African wildlife painting by David Shepard , I discovered a lion that I had previously missed hidden in the bush . Examining another painting , I found splashes of bright yellow and purple on a bucking mustang , color that never attracted my eye previously . These kinds of personal revelations bring me back to the museum again and again , wanting to find more talent waiting to be discovered on each pedestal and within each frame . <p> Here , amidst one of the most impressive collections of sporting and wildlife art in North America one can trace the progression of wildlife art over hundreds of years . <p> The collection is the product of 40 years of research and artful selection by Genesee Country Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Wehle , " Sporting art first became popular in England and northern Europe in the 17th century . At that time , royalty participated in great hunts of deer and wild boar . These colorful affairs were often captured on canvas by early artists , as were game larders depicting the results of the day 's efforts . " The museum 's earliest piece by Dutch painter Johannes Maas the Younger illustrates the drama and magnitude of such a 17th century hunt . During the 1800s , artists were commissioned by noblemen to paint scenes of horse racing , fox hunts , and , for the first time , portraits of highly regarded steeds and hunting dogs . " Before the invention of the camera , " says Mr. Wehle , " this was the only way someone could get such a portrait . " <p> During the time that sporting art was at its height in Europe and England , Antoine-Louis Barye in France created bronze sculptures in which animals were the featured subject . No longer did all great works of sporting art represent animals as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This new style inspired an entire school of French sculptors known as " Les Animaliers , " and eventually led to the popularity of wildlife sculpture in America . At least 30 pieces by these French sculptors are on display at the Gallery of Sporting Art . <p> Wildlife art spread further throughout Europe as more painters began studying and sketching animals in their native habitats . German-born artist Wilhelm Kuhnert traveled extensively throughout Africa in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Although he did his finished work at his Berlin studio , it was his extensive field notes and drawings that enabled him to accurately depict animals that he studied . Because of his accomplishments , Kuhnert is often labeled the " Father of African Wildlife Art , " and he is still considered one of the world 's finest wildlife artists . <p> Even more revered is Bruno Liljefors . Museum curator Diane Jones states , " Many of the contemporary wildlife artists who visit the Gallery of Sporting Art consider Liljefors a major influence on their painting careers . In his home country of Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The gallery is indeed fortunate to have one of the largest public collections of Liljefors paintings in the United States . <p> Liljefors ' success can be attributed to his uncanny abilities as an observer of nature . He spent much of his early life exploring and hunting in the woods near his home , thus allowing him to paint accurate and sensitive interpretations of his natural surroundings . Living in Sweden , his subjects were usually native mammals and birds typical of the northern coasts . <p> Another wildlife artist represented in the Gallery of Sporting Art is Carl Rungius , a native of Germany best known for his paintings of North American big game . About the same time Kuhnert was exploring the wilds of Africa , Rungius traveled to the United States to hunt moose . The moose and the American West became his preferred natural subjects . For 50 years Rungius camped and hunted and sketched in the West until his death in 1959 . <p> Liljefors , Kuhnert and Rungius were alike in being superb artists and dedicated outdoorsmen and naturalists , talents that ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , says Diane Jones , " they were the first artists in their respective geographic locations  --  Europe , Africa and North America  --  to paint animals with a definite sense of style and art , not just as likenesses or images of animals . " Wildlife art had come of age with a style all its own . <p> American sporting art was also influenced by other artists from England and Europe . Arthur F. Tait of England and Hermann Herzog of Germany came to the United States in the middle of the 19th century , when hunting and fishing were becoming recognized as sports . As a result , they discovered a market in this country for sporting scenes . <p> Both Tait and Herzog spent time in the Adirondacks , an area also depicted by New York native George L. Clough . Born in Auburn , Clough studied art in Europe before returning home to continue with his portraits and landscape paintings . Because the Adirondack Mountains were quickly becoming a vacation spot for the growing population of urban-dwellers , his paintings focused on that area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lassell Ripley and Ogden M. Pleissner , are exhibited in the museum , as are many contemporary sporting art paintings . Robert K. Abbett , famous for his depictions of hunting dogs , is just one current painter represented . <p> The gallery 's collection includes a selection of pieces by 20th century wildlife painters , such as Roy Mason , Charles F. Tunnicliffe , Robert Bateman and George McLean , along with 13 originals by Buffalo native Robert Kuhn . Kuhn specializes in American and African wildlife . Although he began his career as an illustrator , in 1970 Kuhn devoted himself to easel painting of animals , most often shown in dramatic situations . Large predatory cats in pursuit of prey species seems to be one of his favorite subjects . <p> Wildlife art in America continues to grow . Curator Diane Jones believes that " as our love of nature and concern for our environment increase , people 's interest in wildlife art also increases . This trend has been recognized by the painting community , which is producing more wildlife art than ever before . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more urban there develops within us a need to find other ways to keep nature close . Some people take up bird watching , while others collect sporting and wildlife art or both . <p> The museum actually offers more for visitors to see than already mentioned . The Gallery of Western America , for example , contains bronzes by Frederic Remington and paintings by W. R. Leigh , Frank Tenney Johnson , Maynard Dixon and members of the Taos art colony . In another room , the Trotting Horse Gallery , are paintings , sculptures and graphics that recall the pageantry and excitement of the trotting horse tradition at the turn of the century . <p> Complementing the gallery 's impressive display of animal and sporting sculptures is the outdoor sculpture garden . Here are full-size and larger-than-life bronzes of native Americans and wildlife , ranging from a leaping tarpon to a bounding deer . An enormous eagle by Kent Ulberg stands guard over Genesee Country Museum 's great meadow , onto which the gallery faces . <p> It is easy for me , because of my own outdoor experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptures in the Gallery of Sporting Art . And I agree with Bob Kuhn and Bruno Liljefors , that intense study of wild animals in their natural habitats does reveal secrets that enhances an artist 's or writer 's ability to interpret the subject . <p> We are fortunate that John Wehle has been able to recognize the special qualities of these great artists and has provided us with the opportunity to appreciate their works and witness firsthand the evolution of an art form . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : " Pintails " by Charles Frederick Tunnicliffe 1970 , watercolor <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : " Sportsman Fishing Beside A Highland Stream " by John Frederick Lewis 1829 , oil on canvas <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ( Top ) " Hunter With Dog In The Adirondacks " by George L.
