Desert 's fragile crust takes millennia to form but only moments to destroy <p> As they barreled across the desert toward Baghdad during the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq last March , the tanks , trucks , and armored personnel carriers churned up huge clouds of dust . Iraqi vehicles mobilized to defend against the onslaught generated their own plumes of grit . In a literal sense at least , much of the dust in Iraq has begun to settle . If history is a guide , however , the ruts the combat vehicles left behind will spew prodigious amounts of dust for years . That airborne material can cause major environmental and health problems . <p> As the battalions maneuvered across the arid terrain , their vehicles often broke through a delicate crust known as desert pavement . This type of veneer covers as much as half of the world 's arid lands . Despite the connotations of its name , desert pavement is n't robust . It 's merely a thin shell of stones that lies atop the dust , soil , or sand . Multi-ton tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bikes and all-terrain vehicles . Even trudging hikers , grazing animals , and the scrabbling of rodents and birds can disrupt desert pavements , exposing subsurface material to erosion and disrupting fragile ecosystems of fungi and algae . <p> Damage can happen in a moment , but the processes that sculpt desert pavement typically act slowly , taking centuries to generate a surface resistant to wind erosion . Therefore , when desert pavements and their biota are wounded by human activity it will take human action to heal them on a shorter timescale . <p> Scientists are currently developing large-scale experiments to determine what methods might be most effective for mending a scarred desert . Successful techniques , far from being of interest only in war-torn regions , might also address a plague of problems that could result from an increase in the recreational use of environmentally sensitive public lands in the American Southwest . <p> BACK TO THE FUTURE In August 1990 , Iraqi troops invaded and captured Kuwait . For the next 6 months , they dug pits in the desert to hide equipment , excavated trenches to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops . Military maneuvers during the liberation of Kuwait in February 1991 scarred the desert further . A comparison of satellite images taken just before and after the conflict show that almost 950 square kilometers of desert pavement were destroyed by such activity says Farouk El-Baz , a geologist at Boston University . The planting or removal of land mines denuded another 3,500 km or so . In all , the desert pavement across more than 20 percent of Kuwait 's land area was disrupted . <p> As a result , immense quantities of the area 's fine-grained soil , previously locked beneath a stony blanket , were lofted by winds . Airborne dust reduced visibility and exacerbated a variety of health problems , such as asthma and other respiratory ailments , says El-Baz . Within months , the fine sands accumulated in dune fields on the northern shore of Kuwait Bay . In western portions of the country , sheets of sand smothered some roads and farms . <p> All that material had been brought to the area over the eons by the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers , says El-Baz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's climate changed about 5,000 years ago and wind began to winnow the river delta 's dried sediments . Dust and sand in the upper layers of sediment were blown elsewhere , but gravel and pebbles were left behind and eventually compacted into a thin armor against further wind erosion . <p> With today 's drier climate in Kuwait and southern Iraq , it would probably take millennia for the wind alone to resculpt a fully mature desert pavement over the regions damaged by this year 's conflict in Iraq , says El-Baz . Restoration of the landscape to its original flat contours would probably limit erosion , minimize health problems related to dust , and decrease the amount of time needed to regenerate the war-torn desert pavement , he notes . <p> However , El-Baz does n't hold much hope for the war-torn soils of Iraq . " Everybody 's thinking about the security of the soldiers there , and rightly so , " he notes . " Nobody 's even thinking about the security of the soil . " <p> FLOATING ROCKS Although the initial phases of a desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface dust and sand , other factors sculpt the rocky shell . <p> When the surface of nascent desert pavement becomes rough enough to interfere with airflow , small , windborne particles can drop out of that slow-moving boundary layer and fall between the cracks of the pavement 's stone mosaic . The trapped dust can even work its way underneath heavy pebbles , says Peter K. Haft a geologist at Duke University in Durham , N.C. Any force that jostles surface pebbles  --  the impact of raindrops or the expansion and contraction of clay particles in the soil as they absorb and release moisture , for instance  --  can make the stones ride upon smaller particles that have recently fallen . <p> Even the footfalls of tiny animals can do the trick , says Haff . He once conducted an informal experiment in a terrarium on his desk , in which he placed a mixture of stones , pebbles , sand , and a few desert beetles large enough to budge marble-size stones as they propelled themselves across the ground . <p> Every few days , Haff scattered a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd added enough sand to create a layer 15 centimeters thick . The largest rocks remained buried at the bottom of the terrarium , and the smallest pebbles mixed throughout the sand . But a significant fraction of the medium-size stones  --  those measuring between 3 millimeters and 15 mm across  --  floated atop the steadily accumulating sand base . <p> Similar jostling of small stones across the surface of the ground can play a part in healing damaged desert pavements . In small-scale field experiments begun in 1983 , Haff and his colleagues removed all surface stones from square patches of various sizes in the Mojave Desert . Over time , they noticed that surface pebbles 1 cm in diameter or smaller began to migrate into the vacant patches from surrounding areas . After a decade , the researchers ' 10-cm-by-b-cm patches had repaved themselves , but the 20-cm and 40-cm plots were n't yet covered by the itinerant stones . Haff estimates that it would take 50 years for such pavement-free plots to mend . <p> That 's a sluggish pace of renewal . If increasing human activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dust could result . <p> TWO-TONE STONES Many rocks in arid areas sport desert varnish , a dark , shiny coating rich in iron oxides and manganese oxide . Although scientists debate how this natural glaze forms , they generally agree that the process takes a long time . Many petroglyphs left by ancient cultures were created when artists scraped away areas of dark desert varnish and exposed the lighter rock beneath . In some cases , desert varnish has n't begun to form on the exposed rock , even though the petroglyphs were created millennia ago . <p> One testament to the age and stability of some desert pavements is the desert varnish that coats only the upward-facing exposed surfaces of the pebbles . While the rocks ' sunny sides are dark and manganese rich , their ground-facing surfaces are often stained orange by iron oxides in the soil . That two-tone coloration enables scientists to recognize whether a desert pavement has been recently disturbed , says Haff . <p> In California 's Greenwater Valley , just east of Death Valley National Park , much of the terrain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been undisturbed for centuries . <p> In April 1998 , after the El Nio climate phenomenon steered above-average rainfall to Greenwater Valley , the normally barren desert pavement became carpeted with short grasses and wildflowers . The following April , after a climatically normal year , that living vegetation had nearly disappeared , Haff says . He also noted broad patches of pavement , ranging from small patches to areas half the size of a football field , where as many as 40 percent of the palm-size stones had been overturned to now sit orange-side up . Only 10 percent of such stones on nearby areas that had been more sparsely vegetated had been turned over . <p> What made the stones turn ? The roots of the grasses and wildflowers that had grown in the cracks of the pavement were n't strong enough to flip the stones , even if the vegetation were uprooted by strong wind , Haff argues . Human activity probably was n't the culprit because the valley lies in a remote area and there were n't any footprints , vehicle tracks , or campfire remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been flipped by rodents or birds rummaging for roots or seeds . In one instance , Haff observed a flock of more than 100 birds foraging among the dead weeds and later found a significant number of overturned rocks there . <p> If widespread enough , such disruptions of desert pavement could serve as long-lasting signs of even brief ecological changes , suggests Haff . Although the vegetation that triggered the purported feeding frenzies in the Greenwater Valley 's desert pavements was ephemeral , the effects of foraging on the desert pavement have lingered much longer . <p> TANKS , A LOT The suddenly mobilized sand and dust that plagued Kuwait after the war 12 years ago  --  and still blot the landscape there today  --  were unleashed during a mere 6 months of military maneuvers . Now imagine the dust that winds could loft from the U.S. Army 's National Training Center , Fort Irwin 's Rhode Island-size facility in the heart of the Mojave Desert in southern California . Ten months each year , the center hosts war games and other exercises involving heavy-infantry vehicles . <p> In places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center 's grounds into a fine silt , just as if it had been exposed to centuries of natural weathering , says Jayne Belnap , a research ecologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Moab , Utah . A lot of that loose material , which is calf-deep in spots , gets kicked up as dust . Elsewhere in the center , the soil has been packed to the point that rainfall does n't infiltrate the surface , which increases runoff there and erosion from unpacked soils nearby . Also , the roots of desert plants often ca n't penetrate packed soils , and the plants therefore are slow to repopulate such areas . <p> The center is " like Kuwait on steroids , " says Robert H. Webb , a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Tucson . In severely compacted areas , it could take a century or so for natural geological processes , such as the expansion and contraction of clays , to restore just the upper 6 cm of soil to its previous consistency . <p> USGS studies of tank tracks at other Mojave Desert training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 5 decades , soil density beneath the rut made by the single pass of a military tank is up to 6 percent higher than it is at a similar depth beneath undisturbed surfaces nearby . That difference may seem small , but investigators found that water seeps into the ground in the old tank tracks only half as quickly , on average , as it does into untouched soil . <p> With large-scale field experiments , scientists might determine which restoration practices are effective , says Eric V. McDonald of the Desert Research Institute in Reno , Nev . He is now in the early stages of designing potential restoration projects for two Fort Irwin sites , each about the area of nine football fields . At one site , where recently disrupted desert pavement had been in place for the past 10,000 years , researchers will look for inexpensive ways to repair damaged portions of the surface , restore the vegetation , and perhaps recapture many of the original soil characteristics . Sensors embedded in the soil beneath revamped surfaces should reveal whether the temperature and soil moisture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At another Fort Irwin site , a low-lying area where the desert pavement is n't yet fully formed , scientists will probably look at a different set of techniques , says McDonald . One possibility is to deposit a gravel veneer and spray on chemical treatments that penetrate several centimeters into the ground and bind soil particles together . Such treatments sometimes are used to control dust at construction sites and on unpaved roads . <p> In field trials that McDonald hopes to implement at a military test site in Arizona , he would apply various combinations of added gravel , soil binders , and other treatments to small plots . Results from these experiments could guide efforts to create new desert pavements at the Fort Irwin sites , he notes . <p> This proposed research might reveal that it 's impossible to artificially restore desert pavement , says McDonald , " but at least we 'd be looking at the issue in a scientific way . " <p> The results of these inquiries could affect more than distant war-torn lands and military training grounds here at home . Even four-wheel-drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although lighter than tanks , the trucks exert about four times as much pavement-busting pressure on the ground as tanks do , because the area truck tires occupy is much smaller than the footprint of a tank tread . That means the actual pressure per given patch of ground is higher for the smaller vehicles . <p> The burgeoning populations of large cities throughout the U.S. Southwest are venturing into arid , environmentally sensitive lands in ever-increasing numbers , McDonald notes . Regardless of whether those folks cross the desert in four-wheel-drive trucks , dune buggies , or hiking boots , they typically do n't tread lightly enough to leave desert pavement intact . If they 're not careful , they could churn up dust that could make life downwind miserable for generations . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : DESERT DUST-UP  --  Military exercises in the Mojave Desert in the early 1940s , practice for World War II tank battles in northern Africa , left scars in desert pavements that are still visible today . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : WET AND DRY  --  Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( left ) , nourished by El Nio rains , had disappeared by the next spring ( right ) .
