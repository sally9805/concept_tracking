Promptly at 6 a.m. , long before Southern California 's chill and brooding morning fog begins to lift , a deputy sheriff unbolts the face-high shutter in the solid steel door of the cell and calls to prisoner 4013970 . O.J. Simpson arises and is led across the hall for his daily shower . Returning to his cell , he shaves at the stainless-steel sink . A heated kitchen cart is wheeled down the corridor , and through a slot in the door Simpson is handed a breakfast of scrambled eggs , potatoes , two slices of wheat bread and coffee brewed in a stainless-steel kitchen vat so wide it uses a bed sheet for a filter . His only utensil is a plastic spoon . <P> Soon , Lieut . John Dewyer , head of the legal unit charged with ensuring that the jail observes all lawful provisions , pays a brief visit . " Any problems ? Been receiving your mail O.K. ? " In a tone more correct than friendly , Simpson says he has no complaints . " And is the bike O.K. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made available to his prisoner . " Yeah , it 's great , " says Simpson with some animation . As on all such occasions , " the case " remains scrupulously unmentioned . <P> During the past two weeks , while his preliminary hearing was in progress , Simpson left the jail at 8:15 on most mornings . After exchanging his dark blue , loose-fitting inmate outfit with LA COUNTY JAIL stenciled on the back for his street clothes , he was escorted into the back seat of a black-and- white sheriff 's van with tinted windows , bound for the criminal-courts building three-quarters of a mile away . Following close behind was an unmarked Chevy Caprice chase car with two armed plainclothesmen . <P> Now , however , as Simpson awaits his arraignment , he faces long , tedious days in his cell , a beige , windowless room measuring 9 ft. by 7 ft. and furnished only with an iron bunk and a stainless-steel toilet next to a sink . A cardboard box on the floor , containing papers and letters , and the odd apple or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson is denied access to mess halls , rooftop exercise areas or even the chapel . His only breaks are two hour-long periods of activity in the " freeway " of the corridor . There he can use the public phone , watch TV on a mobile stand and exercise on the bike . Sometimes he talks on the phone and pedals the bike at the same time . <P> " Over the years we 've housed Sirhan-Sirhan , the Manson family , major organized-crime figures , the individuals involved in the Reginald Denny case and numerous other people with celebrity status , " says Sheriff Sherman Block , Simpson 's chief jailer , " but I 've never seen anything like this . Behind the courthouse this morning I could n't believe what I saw in the way of electronic-media equipment . You could probably cook a huge steak with all the microwaves there  --  or become sterile . "
