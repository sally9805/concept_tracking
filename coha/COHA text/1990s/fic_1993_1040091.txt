 | ever taught . They do not always apply themselves , " she added almost dryly , " but their potential is tremendous . " " Now , " the teacher 's voice turned more serious as she again faced the class . " Many of you may know our guest on a first-name basis , but this week he is Mr. Taggart . Is that understood ? " " Yes , Miss Bradley , " chorused the occupants of the room . " Now , to start off , Mr. Taggart is simply going to observe , but beginning this afternoon I will be choosing students from each form to sit in the back with Mr. Taggart and explain a subject to him . You will speak clearly if you are spoken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of your ability . Let us be-gin . Jackie had never had such a hard time with concentration . She was as aware of Clayton 's presence as anyone could be . Questions plagued her , tortured her even . Would he try to humiliate her or get back at her for the way she 'd treated him ? If only she 'd had a chance to talk to him before . Jackie was completely unaware of the way her thoughts showed on her face . She felt as vulnerable as if she 'd been asked to sit in school in her underclothing . Her tormented thoughts eased a little when she saw Clayton put a hand on Paddy 's shoulder , and more so when she saw him smooth Lexa 's hair , but she was still in a panic . In fact , she was so troubled that unknown to her , her eyes pleaded with Clayton when he came by . He had n't planned to stop , but her eyes were so miserable that he paused . " How 's it going ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembled with relief . " It 's fine , " she told him softly and was rewarded by his kind smile before he passed on to the next row . The day got better from that point , and Jackie even managed to thank Clayton for the ride home . His eyes were warm but not teasing as he acknowledged her words , and Jackie went into the house feeling like she 'd been given the day .  | " I ate lunch with Paddy today , " Milly told her brother . They had cone into the barn , but cold as it was Milly seemed in no hurry to rush inside . She stood holding her books in front of her , her hat and mittens still in place . " I saw you . " Clayton stared at her over the back of the horse . " He said something about Jackie . " " Oh ? " " Yes . He wondered if the two of you might be seeing each other . He said she watched you the whole morning . " Clayton nodded . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think she hates you anymore , Tag , " Milly continued . " I do n't think she hates anyone anymore . " Clayton came out from the stall , patting the roan-colored rump as he passed . He stopped before Milly . " Maybe she 's growing up a little . " " Maybe . She still does n't have many friends , though , " Milly said sadly . " It takes time for a person to live down a bad reputation . Sometimes it never goes away . " " But you 've never been angry back or hated her , have you Tag ? " " Well , not for long . Where Jackie and I are concerned , I brought some of her feelings on myself . I pushed in and teased her , and hurt her in the process . I know better now . " Milly suddenly had to hug her brother . " You 're going to make a wonderful teacher , Tag . I know that with all my heart . " Clayton gladly hugged her in return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart more . Jacqueline , you will go to the back now with Mr. Taggart . Please explain the Upper Form mathematics . Go over what we 've been learning and be certain to take your book . " " Yes , Miss Bradley . " Jackie 's voice was subdued , but she obeyed . Her legs shook just a little as she rose and turned to the back . Jackie sat in the last seat so she did n't have far to go to the table  | and two chairs that had been set up at the back . Clayton was wait ? ing for her , ready to hold her chair . Jackie thanked him in a soft voice and waited until he sat opposite her . She thought they would get right down to business , but Clayton surprised her . " Why do you suppose Miss Bradley chose you to tell me about this ? " " Oh . " Jackie faltered for a moment and made her hands lie still on the table . " Well , I think maybe because I 'm good in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackie looked into his eyes and then down , feeling very self ? conscious . " No , but I like it all right . " " What is your favorite ? " " World history . " Clayton smiled . " Mine too . " Jackie bit her lip , but her smile stretched through . She forced herself to ask , " Did you want to hear about math now ? " " Sure , " Clayton answered easily , and Jackie felt herself relaxing . She knew , however , that Clayton would have been just as content to sit and talk with her about something other than math . She opened the book , and Clayton leaned forward intently . Jackie was very good at explaining things , and everything was familiar to Clayton , who was also good in math . He could n't have said exactly when she lost him , but at some point the young man stopped listening to math and started listening more to the young woman . The sound of Jackie 's voice and the way her slim  --  fingered hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nearly hypnotic , and Clayton wondered when his feelings for her had moved from concern to something deeper . He was still concerned for her and cared more than he could tell her , but there was another feeling sinking deeply into his heart . The funny part was that Clayton did n't know why . Jackie was not sweet and gentle like Eddie , or sensitive and kind like Danny ,  | but she was Jackie just Jackie . She was a girl in whom Clayton had $cen serious faults , but he still cared . And although she tried her hardest not to disclose herself , he also saw a vulnerability in her that tore his heart nearly in two . Maybe she was like the students he hoped to teach one day . He simply ached to " take her on " and help her to be all she could be . Clayton now forced his mind back to the book Jackie was holding . He was going to have to go slowly here , and well he knew it . His emotions could easily take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he wanted to teach students of all shapes and sizes , he did n't have the desire to kiss any of them the way he did Jackie Fontaine . " Did that make sense ? " " Yes . " Clayton swiftly gathered his thoughts . " Yes , it did . Now will you be through with this book before the year ends ? " " I do n't think so . We have some more difficult steps coming up . " Jackie swiftly turned to the back of the book . " See ? Right here . Miss Bradley says we 'll be taking extra time on these . " Clayton studied the pages . Very involved fractions . This too was familiar . He then thanked Jackie and asked her if she would want a ride home . " I 'm not going home today , " she told him . " It 's my day to work at the store , but thank you . " " I can swing you by , " Clayton offered and watched Jackie 's cheeks flush . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book . " Well , it 's up to you . I wo n't do anything you do n't want me to do . " There was something in his tone and the way he said the words that made Jackie think he was talking about far more than a ride in the wagon . She stood swiftly and pushed her chair in . Clayton rose also . " I 'd appreciate a ride , " she nearly whispered , her eyes not readable . " Thank you , Clayton . " With that she slipped away to her seat , and Clayton was left to wonder just what he had said .  | The following Saturday morning Jackie was sitting quietly in a kitchen chair while Eddie trimmed her bangs . She kept her eyes closed but had a tendency to wrinkle her brow , and Eddie kept telling her to hold still . Indeed , Eddie really scolded her when Clay-ton 's voice was heard coming through the house . He was talking as he walked , and it was clear that he had come in the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the table , Clay , " Addy instructed as she entered , the young man behind her . " I 'll run upstairs and get those things for your mother . " " Well , now , " Clayton spoke when his hostess had left , his smile huge . " Can I be next ? " " No , " Eddie told him without hesitation . " Jackie is the third one since 6:30 this morning , and I 'm at my limit . " " My loss , " Clayton announced and sat down to watch . " I think you 're missing some on this side . " Eddie smiled , her eyes still on her work , but Jackie could n't see that . " Oh , no ! " Clayton exclaimed . " Look at that big mistake . And right in the front too ! " Jackie wiggled a little , a smile on her face as well , and Eddie told her to hold still again . " Watch it , Eddie . Do n't make it any worse , " Clayton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | " Hi , Tag . What are you doing ? " Clayton opened his mouth to answer , but Jackie suddenly said , " Making a pest of himself . " Clayton 's mouth remained open , but this time with incredulity . Both Eddie and Sammy were laughing , but he was sputtering like a boiling teakettle . " A pest ! She called me a pest ! " Jackie took a peek at him , her eyes brimming with laughter . " Hold still , Jackie . " " Are you nearly finished ? " " Yes . " " She called me a pest , " Jackie heard Clayton say again . " Well , that 's the last time I help you get a haircut , Jackie Fontaine ! " Jackie only smiled , glad that she could keep her eyes closed . " All right , Clay , " Addy said as she returned , " these are for your mother . Tell her I 'll get the baskets back to her right after the wed-ding . " " Will do , " Clayton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Are you headed into town or home ? " To town . " Can you run the girls to the store ? They 're already late . " " Sure . " " Great . " Addy thanked him with that one word and went to the stairs to call Lexa and Danny . They tumbled down a moment later , glad to be getting a ride , but Jackie , who was now finished at the table , hung back . She had enjoyed teasing with Clayton when she could n't see him , but now she felt foolish . The others had gone to bundle into warm things , so Jackie found herself alone with Clayton . " Did you want a ride ? " he asked . " No , " she said without looking at him . " I have to clean up , so I 'll just walk . " " The snow 's pretty deep ; I 'd be glad to wait . " Jackie finally looked at him . " Whatever you want , " he added .  | Jackie looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry , " she said , feeling oddly breathless and dashing for the stairs . Clayton stood quite still , his heart beating like a trip-hammer in his chest . Had he really seen something there , or had he just wanted to see something ? Only time would tell . A week and a half later Clayton was in the general store with a special gift in mind . Mitch was on hand to help him , but the older man seemed strangely preoccupied . " Maybe I should get Jackie from the back , " Mitch finally sug-gested . " Oh , is she here ? Why do n't you ? Tell her the pest is here . " Mitch smiled and moved away . A few minutes later Jackie emerged from the back , trying very hard not to smile herself . She knew her face was flushed , but Clayton looked and sounded very normal . " Hello , Jackie . " " Hello , Clay . Uncle Mitch said you needed some help . " " Yes . I 'm looking for something for Robert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole family , but I 'd like to get a little something myself . " " Oh , that 's a nice idea . Let 's see . " Jackie turned slowly and tried to think , her mind dealing with the facts . It was still unbelievable that Clayton was offering kindness to her . And she was finding that when he was close , concentration was difficult . She felt as though she 'd been rescued when she thought to look in the household goods . " Actually , you have many choices , " she said as she moved toward that counter . " If you want something practical , these cutglass salt and pepper shakers are five cents each ; if you 're after a little more decorative item , this vase is 38 cents . " Clayton studied all of them . " I wish I 'd thought to ask Eddie . " Jackie shook her head . " It would n't have done any good . I do n't know what all women are like who plan to be married in ten days ' time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . "  | Clayton chuckled . " She told me Robert comes Friday . " " Yes , and she 's praying every day that the snow will begin to melt a little . She said she does n't care if he and Travis get snowed in , she just does n't want them snowed out . " Clayton was smiling , but as he watched Jackie his look was very intent . It rather unnerved her . Beginning to feel flustered , Jackie grabbed the closest thing and held it in the air . " Potato masher . " She waved the metal object in the air . " You could give her that . " Clayton laughed . " Oh , I do n't know . I was thinking maybe a combination rat-and-mouse trap . " Jackie really laughed at that , but then turned serious . " I do know something she and Robert would enjoy . " Jackie reached beneath the counter and brought out a small box . " These are from England , so they 're not as large as American ones . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would probably use them all the time . The only problem is the cost . I ca n't break up the set , and they 're twelve cents each . " She sounded apologetic . " How many are there ? " " Eight . Would you like to see them ? " Ninety-six cents . Clayton 's brain was calculating fast . If he looked at them and liked what he saw , he 'd have a hard time saying no , but a dollar was a lot of money out of his pocket right now . " I 'll look at them , " he said after a moment , and just as he suspected , they were beautiful . He was putting aside literally every penny for his schooling in the fall , but Eddie and Robert were very special to him . " I 'll take them , " he said at last , and Jackie offered to wrap the box . Well satisfied with his purchase , Clayton left the store just a few minutes later , his mind still on Jackie . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to keep things lighthearted . She called him a pest when he thanked her for the help and had swiftly turned away to busy herself with the shelves behind the  | counter . Clayton wondered if he would ever really know where he stood with that girl . Old Doc Edwardson stared across the room at his patient , knowing it had to be the other man 's decision but not agreeing with it . " What if it were Morgan ? Would n't you want to know , Mitch ? " " Yes , but then my daughter 's not getting married in a few days . I wo n't do anything to spoil that joy . " The old doctor nodded . He could hardly argue with that . " Well , take it easy . Maybe that old ticker of yours will give us more time than we think . " " I 'm already taking it easy , " Mitch told him calmly . " Have been ever since Morgan and Addy came . " The doctor pursed his lips , his eyes thoughtful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thanks , Ed , but I 'm not worried . I 've something better waiting on the other side . " Doc Edwardson smiled . He too believed in life after death for those who understood and believed in the work done on the cross . " I can give you something for the pain . Are you interested ? " " How bad is it going to get ? " " It might get very bad , or you might just drop down dead , " came the doctor 's blunt reply . Mitch thought a moment . " I 'll take the bottle , Ed . I do n't want anyone to know until after the wedding , and I was pretty uncomfortable last night . " Doc Edwardson rose and filled a small bottle from his sideboard dispensary . He handed it to Mitch and then waited while the other man stood . They shook hands , and Mitch took his leave . He walked out into the cold , glad that the snow was starting again . It was early in the day , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and he might have been questioned . Eddie 's wedding was a week from Saturday . Mitch was n't ready to talk  | ut his need to see the doctor until sometime after that day , if r . Eddie 's heart thundered in her chest as the knock sounded at the door . She put a shaky hand to the lace at her throat . It might not be Robert and Travis , but Eddie was certain that it must be . She walked with unsteady steps to the front door , and her heart melted within her as she saw him standing there . " Hello , Eddie . " His soft , deep voice came to her ears , and Eddie could n't help herself . She threw her arms around his neck and hugged him with all her might . " I did n't think you 'd ever get here , " she whispered close to his ear as he bent to hold her . " It felt like years , but not now . Now I can hold you and take you home with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see his face . He was smiling at her . " We 're heating the out-of-doors . " " Oh ! Right ! Come in and get warm . " Not until Robert was inside did Eddie notice he was alone . " Where 's Travis ? " " We stopped at the store to leave our gear at Uncle Mitch 's . Travis said he 'd come home with your father this evening . He had some idea that I might want to see you alone . " Eddie smiled . " And did you ? " " Yes . " Eddie bit her lip . " Mother 's in the living room . Would you like to come in and see her ? " " Not yet , " Robert told her , and the smile fell from Eddie 's face . Robert was taking her in his arms again and kissing her in a way that made her forget she had a mother . When Eddie came up for air , she could only stand and look into Robert 's eyes . She had prayed that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task . " I 'm so glad you 're here . "  | " As am I. How are you ? " " Fine . Ready to be your wife . " " No last minute plans to chase after ? " " No . Everything is ready , so we can enjoy my family this week . We have only to see Pastor Munroe at some point and work at keeping my nerves at bay . " Robert smiled and kissed her again . " Eddie , " her mother now called from the next room . " Bring Robert in so I can say hello . " " All right , Mother , " she answered and turned to her fiance . " Lead the way , " he offered , and Eddie thought he was such a gentleman . She 'd have laughed if she 'd known he did it for himself ; Eddie was as delightful from the back as she was from the front . " Welcome , Robert . " Addy stood and offered her cheek as they came into the room . Robert gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to reacquaint themselves . Addy told of how she received a letter from Robert 's family and had already answered in return . Robert seemed very pleased . There was so much to share . They talked for nearly an hour before Addy rose to get them some re-freshment . " I 'm looking forward to meeting Travis , " Eddie told him . " I hope Father comes soon after the girls get home . " " I do n't know if I 'll be ready by then , " Robert commented , but he was smiling . Eddie cocked her head to one side . " Now , what did that mean , Mr. Langley ? " " Only that you feared I would fall for one of your sisters , and now I think I just might lose you to Travis . " Eddie laughed and Robert joined her . " Well , " she said primly , still smiling at the man she loved . " That is not going to happen . " " Are you sure ? " He was still teasing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen him , Eddie . "  | " Good-looking ? " Eddie 's brows rose with feigned interest , but this time Robert did n't answer . He smiled at her , however , and picked up her hand . Eddie knew it had all been in fun ; nothing could change her feelings for Robert , but she did wonder what the other man looked like . 111  | Lexa and Sammy could do nothing but stare at Travis Buchanan that evening , and Danny blushed to the roots of her ha ) every time he glanced in her direction . Eddie had never seen he sisters behave this way . She had exchanged more than one amuse glance with Robert as well as Travis . When Travis first arrived with their father , he , Robert , Morgan Jackie , and Eddie all ended up visiting in the living room . The younger girls were helping with dinner , but they thought of innu merable reasons to come and ask something of Eddie or Jackie . A one point , Eddie mentally shook her head . A rancher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jean and cowboy boots . His wavy , dark brown hair was a little long of his neck , but his eyes were light blue and clear as a child 's . Hl teeth were startlingly white against his rugged features , and he w9 taller than Robert by two inches . His manner toward the family was courteous and gentle , and Eddie could tell that the girls felt very special when he spoke to them . Travis was very handsome , but the way her sisters were acting , she 'd have thought they had never see a man before . Eddie was relieved when it was time for them to go off to bet Even Jackie , who had been the only one not staring , was sent o her way , and the adults were finally alone . Eddie was on the ver$ of apologizing , but Morgan had n't noticed a thing and began t question Travis about the cattle business . " How many head do you have ? "  | " About 1500 . It fluctuates . " " And to whom do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle into the Denver stock-s and as far as Cheyenne . " Morgan leaned forward intently . " How many men do you have working for you ? " " That varies with the season . I need more hands during roundup d less in the winter months . " " Do you have trouble with thieves ? " Addy cleared her throat , and Morgan turned to her and smiled sheepishly . " Am I monopolizing the conversation , dear ? " Addy smiled in return . " Something like that . Sammy asked if u would come up and kiss her good-night . " " All right . If you 'll excuse me , " Morgan said to the room at large and exited silently . " I wonder if the girls will ever get to sleep tonight , " Addy mmented . " It must be the wedding . I 've never seen them this distracted . " Eddie tried to stop herself , but at that moment she looked at obert and they both burst out laughing . " What did we miss ? " Travis asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , " replied the equally confused hostess . " Mother , " Eddie nearly gasped . " They were n't distracted ; they were beheaded . And it 's not the wedding ; it 's Travis . I 've never seen Danny blush so many times in my whole life . " Addy finally caught on . Her amused gaze went to Travis , who now understood as well . " Should I be worried that you 're going to elope with one of my daughters , Mr. Buchanan ? " Travis chuckled . " As lovely as they are , Mrs. Fontaine , I 'm not in the market for a wife . " They all laughed before Addy changed the subject and asked Robert if they were settled in at Mitch 's . " Yes , we are . It 's very hospitable of him . " Robert hesitated . " He seemed tired , however . "  | " Yes , " Addy agreed . " I do n't think he feels well . The winter is dragging on , and I think the wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Doc Edwardson after next weekend . " " He mentioned that he had something special for Eddie and me . " Oh , yes , " Eddie said , remembering that Uncle Mitch had said something to her before . " He asked if we would come by sometime early next week and stay for dinner , just the two of us . " " Oh , " Addy said , and Eddie turned to her and smiled . " Do you know what it is ? " " Yes , " Addy smiled in return . " You 're going to be very pleased . " Eddie was still smiling over this when Morgan joined them once again . They talked much too late . The following day was a workday , but a week was such a short time , and they all felt anxious for every moment . Robert and Travis finally made their way to the back door of the store , through the shadowy interior , and up the stairs to Mitch 's rooms . His apartment had a door at the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was down a hallway , where the apartment split into several smaller rooms , all on one side . One room was a kitchen and dining area , and one was Mitch 's sitting room . The rest were bedrooms . Some of the rooms connected , and others stood alone . The original builder and owner had probably intended to rent the rooms out , but Mitch kept them for himself . Now the two guests moved as silently as possible in order not to disturb their host . Once in their room , which sported two small beds , they found he had left a lantern burning . " Well , what did you think ? " Robert whispered as both men sat on their own beds to undress . " I think you 're marrying the kindest woman God put on the earth . " Robert smiled , his chest filling on a huge sigh of contentment . " She 's wonderful . That big house has been just plain lonely without her . " " It is n't long now . "  | " No . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . Robert s under the covers first and said , " It 's too bad Jackie 's not a little bit older . " " It would n't matter , Robert ; she would still seem too young . vcn Eddie seems young . " Robert raised up on one elbow and stared across the room . " I do n't know what you mean , Travis . You 're younger than I am by three years . " " It 's not a measurement in years , Robert . Eddie is very mature , and she 's going to make you a wonderful wife . " Travis fell silent then , and Robert gave him a moment . " I have n't shared a lot with you , Robert , but my life before Christ was pretty worldly . I did a rot of wandering . I look into the eyes of those sweet girls , and I know they have n't seen anything of what this sinful world has to offer . " This Robert could understand . A man wanted a wife who would understand him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he said it . Eddie had done that on countless occasions in her letters ; she could read between the lines and guess Robert 's thoughts before he voiced them . Travis was not saying he wanted a worldly wife , just one who would understand where he 'd been . " I 'm glad you told me , Travis . " " Yeah , me too . Good-night , Robert . " " Good-night , Travis . " " Now , " Mitch 's eyes sparkled , his color looking better than it had all week , as he locked the front doors of the store and turned to his niece and Robert . " I 've made some dinner , but first I want to give you your gift . " Eddie smiled in anticipation . Mitch 's mood was infectious . " My gift to you is to pick out anything you 'd like . " Eddie gasped . " Oh , Uncle Mitch , how sweet . " She turned to Robert . " How shall we ever decide ? "  | Robert looked surprised as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , there must be many things you need , settling into a n home and starting a life together , " Mitch said with vigor as he gan to move about the store .

Even if yours are in good shape now , you could l one on the trip to Boulder . " It took Eddie and Robert a moment to realize he meant an thing and everything they needed . Eddie was shaking her head , b Mitch spoke with the firmest voice she 'd ever heard from him . " I want to do this , Edwina . You 're my niece , and I have a sto full of goods that you wo n't be able to shop for in the future . I will do this .

Eddie was feeling overwhelmed but managed to mention the shipping cost . " There 's no need to worry about that , " Mitch told them . " I 've two trunks in the back that belonged to your Aunt Clara . We 'll load those up , and they 'll go with you . " Eddie 's sigh was heartfelt , and she hugged Mitch tenderly . " You 'll have to come and see us , Uncle Mitch , to see how we 've used all these things you 've given us . " Mitch patted her back . " I 'm getting a little old to be traveling about , honey . " Eddie only smiled . " Well , we 'll be back often , and we can write and tell you everything in between . " Mitch only smiled . " I 'd better run to check on this dinner you have started , " Eddie offered , moving toward the stairs with graceful strides . Mitch watched her go , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The younger man thought about Eddie 's words but saw the truth in Mitch 's eyes . The older man was very aware that he 'd  | found out .

" Mitch 's hand came out , and they shook . Robert thanked him , it was an effort to push the words around the tightness in his hat . " Uncle Mitch , Robert , I 've put supper on . " " We 'll be right up , " the older man called . With one more glance each other , they started toward the stairs .  | Eddie and Robert 's wedding day broke crisp and clear , the s shining off the snow and nearly blinding the Fontaine family they headed to the church . Eddie 's face was pale with excitemen Seeing it , Jackie reached to squeeze her hand . The older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest sister , and her respon or rather lack thereof , was the same . Jackie looked to Lexa and shrugged . " I hope I get married someday , " Sammy said with a wistful sigh . " Are you also hoping that Travis Buchanan will wait for you ? * her mother asked from the front seat . Surprisingly , Sammy did n't blush . " He 's so handsome " was her only comment , and Addy watched as a smile widened Mor-gan 's mouth . " You must think it 's funny , " Addy said softly for his ears . " No . " The smile was still in place . " I just remember a young woman saying much the same thing when she did n't know that a certain young man was listening . " Addy smiled as well . " I knew you were there all along , Morgan Fontaine , and we both know I married you only because you were so homely I knew that no one else would have you . " All the girls , save the still-dreamy Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he refused to tell . However , they could  | do their own figuring when Morgan brought the sleigh to a halt in front of the church and exuberantly kissed his wife . An hour later Addy fussed with Eddie 's dress and veil as Morgan , with Jackie at his side , looked on . Jackie 's dress was a velvet in a deep burgundy color , but Eddie 's was cream-colored satin , overlaid with lace across the entire bodice , up the high neckline , and down the long sleeves . When the mother  --  of  --  the  --  bride had finished her tucking and adjusting , she stood back and smiled at her lovely daughter . " You 're the most beautiful bride in the world , Eddie . Robert will be so pleased . " Eddie smiled and the women embraced . " I 'd best get to my seat , " Addy said to Morgan , and he saw her to the door . " Come outside with me , Jackie , " Addy called before she left . " That way you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start down . " " All right . " The door closed softly at that point , leaving Morgan and Eddie alone . Morgan turned to look at his daughter , his throat feeling oddly tight . " Well , " she said softly , " this is it . " " Yes , " Morgan said inadequately , but then his head tipped to one side . " It 's too bad that a man ca n't experience this before it actually involves him . " " What do you mean ? " Morgan sighed . " Your mother married me against her father 's wishes . I have n't thought about what that day might have felt like for him until right now . You go with my blessing , but there 's no way Robert can understand how I 'm feeling until it 's his turn to stand with his own daughter .

She 'd had the same thoughts so many times . " Change is not bad , " she said softly , " but neither is it easy . I ' miss you more than I can say . " Morgan hugged her , and just ten minutes later Jackie announc that it was time . Eddie went very white upon hearing those words but Morgan whispered words of encouragement , and it was n't Ion before she was given over to Robert 's waiting hand . Her heart calm then , but the whole thing overwhelmed her just a little . Robert was pale himself , and Eddie knew he was feeling the same rush of ' emotion . The ceremony was over before she knew it , and family and friends were crowding around them to offer congratulations . They stayed at the church for over an hour , talking and thanking people for coming , before Travis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morgan , Addy , Mitch , and the younger girls had all left , as had most of the guests , but Jackie , as maid of honor , was standing by to go with the bride , groom , and Travis , who had stood as best man . " I think we had better get on our way , " he suggested . " They 're probably waiting for you . " Eddie did n't need to be asked twice . They had worked hard on the reception , and many people had offered to help . She wanted to be on hand to thank them all in person . Travis bundled them all in the large sleigh , pulled by Mitch 's team of matched black geldings . Jackie was in front with the best man and the newlyweds were in the back . They were no more settled in the seats when Robert grabbed Eddie and gave her a long , hard kiss . " We 're going to be entertaining everyone in town for the next several hours , so I thought I 'd do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sheer delight and leaned to kiss him again . " I think they 're acting up back there , " Jackie said loudly to Travis . " I think you 're right . I myself am blushing just at the thought . "  | They pulled into the Fontaine yard amid much laughter . Sure gh , it looked as if the whole town had already arrived . Eddie Is n't think how they would all fit in , but they managed . Food served immediately , and folks stayed for hours . The cakes were cious . With tears in her eyes , Eddie thanked her mother and Elaine Taggart for all their hard work . Both of the older women kcd utterly drained , but when most of the guests had gone on it way , family and close friends gathered in the Fontaine living m to watch Robert and Eddie unwrap their gifts . Uncle Mitch asked to be excused , and Morgan had run him to the store , but vis and the Taggart family were present . Jackie and Clayton ended up on chairs close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , they 'd had no chance talk . Clayton glanced at her lovely profile and wanted to tell her at she looked beautiful in her new dress , but there was somemg vulnerable about her right then and he refrained . It occurred to him very suddenly that this was the end of life as she had known it . Her closest sister , roommate , confidante , and friend was leaving . Clayton found himself praying for her heart as the gift-opening began . " Oh , are n't they pretty , " Eddie commented as she pulled out two embroidered pillow slips . " Look at the workmanship . " " Very nice , " Robert agreed and worked on the next package . " Who is this from ? " Eddie wished to know . " The card said The O'Brien Family . ' " I think you met them , Robert . Paddy O'Brien is a good friend of Milly and Danny . " " I think I did too . " " Oh , it 's a bread tray ! " Eddie exclaimed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " They loved the spoons from Clayton and had a wonderful time with all the gifts . Indeed , there was much laughter on several occasions . At one point Eddie opened a gift and held it aloft , her brow drawn down in puzzlement . " What is it , Robert ? " " I was hoping you would tell me. "  | Both husband and wife looked to Addy and Elaine , who stared at the silver creation and then at one another . When everyone realized that neither one could identify it , the room erupted in laughter . The last burst of merriment came just a few minutes later when Eddie opened a box and inside was a baby 's bib . She blushed to the roots of her hair and would n't hold it up . Robert took it and did the honors , a sweet smile on his face . Eddie was still blushing amid the laughter when she said , " All right , who 's responsible ? " No one would own up to it , but Eddie suddenly caught Jackie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jacqueline Faye ! " Eddie scolded her , now laughing as well . You rascal ! " " I saw it at the store and could n't resist , Eddie . I 'm sorry . " Eddie only shook her head , and after that , the party began to break up . Addy announced that she was going to fix something to eat and everyone was welcome to stay . Elaine , Milly , and Danny went with her , and Robert took that moment to lean close to his bride . " Are you hungry ? " he asked . " Not a bit , but I am starting to feel tired . " " I think we 'll say our goodbyes and head to the hotel . If you decide you want to eat , I 'll have the hotel fix us something . " Eddie nodded , and Robert went to tell the others . Thankfully , only Addy and Morgan came to the door with them . " We 'll be over to join you for lunch tomorrow after church , " Robert informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to sleep in . ' All right , Robert , " Morgan agreed with him . " I 'm not sure we 'll even make it out ourselves , but we 'll look for you around noon . " Addy hugged them both , and Travis came through the front door to tell them that the sleigh was ready . Just minutes later they were on their way . The hotel staff was very accommodating , and one of the men came out to stable the horse for the night . Robert had seen to the baggage that afternoon , so without fuss they walked up the oak  | staircase to the second floor of the hotel . Room 6 was spacious , with two double beds and a private bath . Several lanterns were lit , and Eddie preceded Robert into the room . Robert closed the door and leaned against it . He stared at Eddie where she had stopped at the corner of the bed . For a time they did n't speak , but then Eddie , feeling self-conscious , began to move around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the alley below , but it was too dark to see outside . She inspected the chandelier , peeked into the closet and bathroom , and then moved to sit on the edge of the far bed . Robert pushed off from the door and moved to sit on the bed opposite her . He stared at her for several more seconds before he shared the thoughts of his heart . " Every day I confidently run a large bank in a booming town with a certain measure of ease , but here , now , with you , I feel completely unsure . " " Unsure about me , or about this night ? " " This night . I 'm 29 years old , Eddie , but you 're the only woman I 've kissed who was n't my mother , aunt , or cousin . I 've saved myself and I 'm not sorry , but this is the first time in a long time that I have n't known exactly what to do . " Eddie shrugged as an adorable grin covered her mouth . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming to the fore . " Well . " Her voice was bracing . " It ca n't be too complicated . " She shifted a little , and the mattress bounced beneath her . " I mean , we love each other , and I think we start with a kiss , and we both enjoy that . " Again she shrugged and smiled . Suddenly Robert wanted to laugh with hysterical joy . She was unlike anyone he 'd ever known . He stood just long enough to take her hand in his and bring her over next to him to sit on the bed . They settled in , side-by-side , and just talked . Robert relaxed and Eddie leaned against him , her adoring eyes on his face as they shared their thoughts from the day . There was no pomp or ceremony when they began to kiss and hold each other , just warmth and caring .   " I love it when you kiss me , " Eddie told him , blue eyes twinkling into gray . " For a moment there I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Robert chuckled low in his throat and kissed her again . He should have known that God would honor his desire to stand righteously before Him on his wedding night . After all , God had given him Eddie , and at the moment Robert could find nothing over which to be more thankful . The time after Sunday dinner the next day was a little busier than Eddie had hoped for , but there was much to be packed before she , Robert , and Travis left the next morning . The trunks were readied , the newlyweds spent some time with Uncle Mitch , and they also went to see Clayton . Eddie wanted to cry when they parted , but Clayton reminded her that he would be living in Denver in the fall , and just maybe there was a chance he could get to Boulder later in the year . This did comfort Eddie some , but her throat was still tight . As she left , all she could do was pray that she would make it through this separation from her family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackie grow closer . Jackie needed someone , and so did Clayton . It seemed so ideal to the young bride that her sister and friend should form a friendship . That evening Robert and Eddie spent a wonderful few hours with Eddie 's whole family . Travis was with them as well , and it was a night full of memories to be cherished . Travis went back to Mitch 's for that last night , and Jackie took the small room off the kitchen so Robert and Eddie could take the bedroom she 'd shared with Jackie all these months . When they were settled in the room , all the changes in Eddie 's life overwhelmed her . Wondering how she was going to leave them all , Robert held her as she cried . " What if one of them dies before I can see them again ? " she sobbed .   " You know where they 're going , " Robert comforted her . " You 'll them in heaven someday . " " Not my father , " Eddie whispered fearfully . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must be placed in God 's care as well , Eddie . It 's the only way you 'll have peace . " Eddie continued to cry , and Robert prayed softly , his mouth close to her ear . Eddie calmed some and then kissed him with a kind of tender desperation . For a time their departure was forgotten . In the morning only Morgan went with them to the stage office . Eddie was trembling slightly , but God had touched her heart early that morning as she 'd read the Word and prayed , and peace surrounded her . She was going to hurt over this departure , but this was what she had longed after and prayed for for months . She was Robert 's wife , and it was right and good . Knowing that , she trusted God to take her on her way . That afternoon Clayton picked the girls up from school and was not at all surprised to find them rather subdued . Milly had gained permission to stay and be with Danny for a time , and as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just moving to step down when Clayton turned and spoke to her . " Are you all right ? " Jackie sat back against the seat and looked at him . To his utter astonishment , he watched as tears filled her eyes . Clayton worked at not responding with the surprise he felt . After a moment Jackie said , " I just ca n't believe she 's gone . I gave her the bib as a joke , but she probably will have a baby , and I wo n't be there to be a part of it . There was talk that we might be together at Christmas , but if Eddie 's about to have a baby ? " Jackie cut off and turned away . Clayton 's voice came gently to her . " Do n't borrow trouble , Jackie . Eddie and Robert may not have children right away . It 's impossible to know . And maybe your father   will decide that all of you need to go and visit them this summer . So much can happen between now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clayton watched her helplessly . Finally she turned back . " Will you go and see them when you go to Denver this fall ? " " I do n't know . I 'd like to , but it all depends on my finances and studies . " Jackie nodded and glanced out over the snow-covered mountains and then down the canyon before looking back at him . He was still watching her . She had n't wanted to talk about this on Saturday , and somehow he 'd known that . Jackie thought he must like her some , but she was afraid to find out that she might be wrong . " You had better get inside , " Clayton said , breaking the silence , or were both going to freeze . " " Would you like to come in ? " Jackie offered , feeling as though her heart had stopped . " I 'd love to , " Clayton answered , his eyes drilling straight into Jackie 's and causing what little breath she had left to lodge in her throat . " But I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday . " Jackie told herself to make light of it . Tell him you did n't mean it anyhow and that he 's still a pest , but the words would not come . " I hope you 'll ask me again , " Clayton added , his eyes now smiling tenderly . Jackie only nodded , her eyes still held by his . " I will , Clayton . Thank you for the ride . " He watched as she climbed from the sleigh and then as she went toward the door . She turned and lifted a hand before she slipped inside , and Clayton managed to wave back in return . He was thankful that the horses knew the way home ; he could n't see anything but Jackie 's huge blue eyes and the way they 'd filled with tears .   The Fontaines found that spring did not come as swiftly to the Rocky Mountains as it did to New England . March passed into April and April headed toward May before there was any real sign of the snow leaving . They had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into rivers of water , but then they had a blizzard again the last week in May . Not until the first week in June did Georgetown begin to burst with new life , and when it got started there was no stopping it . Wildflowers bloomed in every direction , and the sight and sounds of local birds began to fill the air . School was down to just four days when Miss Bradley gave the class an assignment . They were told to bring samples of the area 's plant life to class for the following two days . They were divided into teams , and the goal was originality . Anything brought in that all the teams found counted for only a few points . Plants or flowers that just a few teams located were worth a little more . Foliage that no other team produced was worth nearly enough points to win the whole competition . Paddy , Jackie , Milly , Danny , and Sammy had been assigned to a team , and they came from the schoolhouse with plans to start the hunt that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . He 'd not been home for well over a month , and the girls were not only excited to see him but ready to enlist his help . " We need you , Tag , " Sammy told him without any explanation . Clayton looked to Milly , who in her excitement , had left out many of the details .   " Are n't you supposed to do this on your own ? " he finally questioned them . " We will , " Danny explained , " but our mothers are never going to let us go up on the ridge by ourselves . I mean , Paddy 's with our team , but he might not be able to come . I know if you take us in the wagon , we can all go . " Clayton 's eyes scanned the group . Sammy 's face was filled with entreaty . Milly looked ready to argue if he said no , and Lexa was looking at some of the boys who rode horses to school and were now leaving . Jackie had n't said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eager eyes . " All right , " Clayton said . Shouts and cheers filled the air , and as the girls climbed in , Milly began to give orders like a drill sergeant . " Okay , Tag . We 'll drop the Fontaines at their houses so they can change . Then we 'll rush to our house so I can change . Then we 'll go pick them up . We know just the place we want to go , but we 've got to be sneaky or we 'll be seen . " " Why , pray tell , do we need to be sneaky ? " Clayton 's voice was dry with humor , but his sister was utterly serious . " Clayton ! This is a competition . If the others see where we go , we wo n't find anything unusual . " Clayton nodded , still not sure he understood . No one had bothered to explain the rules to him . He did as Milly asked , however , and it was n't more than 30 minutes before they were back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team and not all that interested in the hunt so she stayed home , but the rest had dressed in work clothes , and each had a basket . Addy came out to wave them off and warn them not to be overly late . Not until they 'd pulled away from the house , though , did Danny lean close and say , " We 're not going to the ridge . " " We 're not ? " Clayton asked , trying not to laugh at her conspiratorial tone . " No . We only said that to throw the other kids off track . We want to go way down the creek to the meadow . " ' All right , " Clayton whispered back and Danny beamed at him .   " You 're a good sport , Tag . " " Thank you , Danny . So are you . " The plan would have been ideal if several other groups had n't thought of it . Clayton heard the girls sigh . He knew they were feeling let down . Surprisingly , Jackie , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make everyone feel better . " There are thousands of varieties out here , you know . We can go along the creek bed and probably still come up with something new . All of our houses are surrounded by plant life . We can always go home and try there . " " Yeah , " Sammy said . " Let 's start here and then try at home . " With that they piled from the wagon and walked through the grasses that would be knee  --  high by late summer . Although she was very aware of Clayton 's presence , Jackie did nothing to show it . However , he was suddenly beside her , the others now racing on toward the banks of the creek . " How are you ? " Clayton asked politely . " I 'm fine . How was your trip ? " " Profitable . The land was extensive , far more than the owner thought , and we found an extra rock outcropping , ideal for mining . Which , " Clayton added with delight , " brought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So your schooling is all set ? " " Just about . I 'll have to put in some time this summer , but it wo n't be outrageous . " " Where will you live ? " Jackie suddenly asked . " With my grandmother , as long as it works out . " " What could go wrong ? " They were at the creek now , and Clayton stopped by the water , a small tree at his back , his face reflective . " Nothing wrong exactly , but I 'm not sure how far it is to the school , and my grandmother may have certain house rules that wo n't work for me . I 'm not anticipating trouble , but I am trying to keep my mind open . " Jackie nodded . She wanted to say more , to be witty and amus-ing  --  anything to keep him talking  --  but no words would come . Feeling suddenly very shy with him , she knelt and began to pull   flowers from the ground . Clayton took his cue from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While he was working over the grasses , it came to him very suddenly and without regret that Jackie was not the woman for him . At times his heart had dreamed of her taking an interest in him and even growing old enough to know her true feelings , but now he could see it was not going to work . Clayton thought about Eddie and once again realized how he missed her . Although not in love with her , he did know she was the type of woman he was looking for . Maybe in a few years Jackie would be like that , but by then he would be away from Georgetown for most of the year . Depending on the available teaching positions , he might never live in Georgetown again . As he fingered a tiny bloom , Clayton felt an incredible peace steal over his heart . At one time he would have mourned not having something deeper with Jackie , but now it was all right . He chanced a look in her direction and found her back to him . Clayton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of her . It was amazing , but now he felt utterly detached . Jackie could even fall in love and marry someone else right now , and Clayton would say nothing more than congratulations . He still cared , but then he cared for all of the Fontaine girls . Clayton now looked over to see how the others were doing and rose to join them . He had n't taken two steps when Jackie cried out . " It 's in my collar ! What is it ? I 'm going to get stung ! " She was frantic in a matter of moments , and Clayton rushed to her side . " What is it ? " " I do n't know , " she howled . " I 'm afraid to touch it . " Clayton saw what looked like a flutter of wings at her throat , and risking the sting , he reached up and plucked at the insect 's legs . " A grasshopper , " Clayton said with relief and tossed it to the side . " Are you okay ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way along the creek line . Jackie turned in alarm . Milly and her sister had stopped to stare at her . She 'd been screaming like she was on fire . Her face now reddened with embarrassment , and she turned swiftly away .   " It 's nothing , " Clayton , seeing her embarrassment , called to the others . He turned to Jackie . " Are you all right ? " She would n't look at him . " Yes , Clayton . " She sounded angry . " I 'm fine . Just leave me alone . " Clayton hesitated for only a moment . Turning to join the other girls , he realized he 'd come to his new resolve just in time . He saw then that he 'd been walking around Jackie as if on eggshells . Well , no more kid gloves . He was a kind , fair man , but he was n't doing her any favors by putting her on a pedestal . From now on he was going to treat her like he did everyone else . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her parents when Clayton was out one week . " First he tries to be kind to her , and she hates him . Then she 's kind back , but now Clayton acts like he does n't care one way or the other . He 's back to teasing her . Jackie laughs more than she ever has and watches him whenever she does n't think anyone notices , but Clayton 's not making any effort to get closer to her . " Elaine sighed gently and made herself leave the dishes . Kevin was already at the table with Milly , so she joined them . " May I tell you something , Milly ? " " Sure , Mom . " Elaine sat quietly for a moment and then began . " I think your father would agree with me if I told you that I 'm not a very complicated person . I lived in the same house from the time I was born until I married your father . I had a father , mother , and brother who all loved me . I had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nothing like what I felt when I met your father . I had some adjustments when he wanted to move from Denver to Georgetown , but our life here has been wonderful . I have you and your brother , and I have God 's Word and your father . Your father and I have remained faithful to each other , and God has repeatedly blessed us . It has n't always been easy , but God has taken care of us and we 've kept our eyes on Him .   " I grew up next door to a girl whose name was Nadina . Some of the boys from church were attracted to Nadina , but she was always interested in the wild boys at school . We were fairly close , but she never wanted to talk about Christ or the things of the Bible . I realized later that my parents struggled with how close we were , but they prayed for me daily , and with God to strengthen me I was spared much heartache . " Nadina and I have n't had any contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed . Nadina never married but had babies with several different men . She eventually left them all , her children included , and went to California . The last I heard , she 'd committed suicide . " Milly bit her lip , but she was still listening . " Now , what 's my point ? " Elaine continued . " I 'll tell you . We are all responsible for our choices , but sometimes life is complicated . Sometimes we cause the complication and sometimes others make it that way . I do n't know why it was so different for Nadina and me , except to say that I was a simple girl . " " You understand that your mother is not talking about intelligence , do n't you , Milly ? " Kevin cut in . " She talking about how simple life can be if we obey God ; not easy , but simple . " Milly nodded and Elaine went on . " I would say that Jackie is not a simple girl . Eddie is . Here they are , sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eddie trusted God for the man she loved , and she is able to give of herself . For reasons that no one seems to understand , Jackie guards herself carefully . If she were a poker player , I 'd say she keeps her cards very close to her chest . She does n't let herself out , nor does she let anyone in . " When you ca n't give of yourself , Milly , your world is very small . Addy Fontaine came to town , and I befriended her . I took a risk . For all I know , she could have hurt and used me in a terrible way , but she did n't . Jackie is not willing to give of herself . She 's pretty , so Clayton was probably attracted to her , but I think he 's found that she 's not the girl for him . Remember how you felt when Pastor Munroe 's nephew was here ? " Milly was blushing , but she nodded .   " You would n't go out the door unless every hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer because you took so much time in front of the mirror fretting over your appearance . Do you worry like that when Paddy 's around ? " " No , " Milly admitted with a smile . " Do you understand what your mother is saying , Milly ? " her father wished to know . " I think so . Clayton can relax now because Jackie 's just a friend . " " Right . " " How do you know all of this , Mom ? " " Clay has talked to your father off and on . His heart is so big and caring , but he wants a woman who will care as much as he does and not keep him at arm 's length . Changes come with age , but by 16 you can usually tell what a person is going to be like . Outgoing , independent , shy , talkative , bold , levelheaded ... " Elaine shrugged . " It usually comes to the surface by the time you 're Jackie 's age . I think Clay is seeing this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both of them . Besides , he 's leaving at the end of the summer . It will make it all the harder to leave if his heart is committed here in Georgetown . " Milly nodded . It made so much sense . Her young heart had prayed many times about this , and now she understood . Had she only known it , she would have continued her prayers for someone down the road who was struggling as well  --  someone much closer to Jackie than herself . " I wish I understood , Danny , " Addy said softly , trying not to cry . " I told Jackie that she could n't be afraid of the risk , and now Clayton treats her like anyone else . For a while there I thought there might be something special . I think she 's going to feel betrayed . " Danny looked with compassion at her mother , but said , " She 's having a better time with him these days , Mother . I mean , she 's laughed more in the last few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "   Addy nodded . " She 's missed Eddie more than any of us do . " " And in all fairness , Mother , " Danny now spoke beyond her years , " Jackie is very prickly if she gets embarrassed . She 's also arrogant and sometimes behaves like a child when she does n't get her way . It 's a wonder Clay even wants to befriend her . " Addy burst into tears , and Danny felt terrible . She went to her mother and sat close . " I 'm sorry , Mother ; I should n't have said that . " Addy took several minutes to compose herself . Danny sat quietly , feeling utterly wretched . " I 'm sorry , Mother , " she repeated . " It 's not your fault , Danny . You spoke the truth , but a mother never thinks it 's going to happen to her child . A mother never thinks her child is going to be the unlovable one . Years ago I knew a girl who was so inquisitive that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on conversations , read our diaries if she had the chance , and then went home and told her mother everything . She was so intrusive that we just shunned her . " Addy sighed . " And now my own daughter is so hard to get close to that people wo n't even give her a chance . " Danny did n't know what to say , but a little bit of anger was kindling inside of her toward Clayton Taggart . She knew it was n't his fault exactly , but Danny did n't want Jackie to be hurt . " Have I upset you , Danny ? " Her mother had been watching her face closely . " I feel angry with Tag , " she admitted . Addy turned her daughter 's face toward her and spoke gently , reminding herself that Danny was rather young to be burdened with this . " As you reminded me , honey , Jackie is having a good time with Clay right now . That means Jackie 's hurt is probably bigger in my mind than in real life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " " Good girl . We 'll just keep praying , Danny . We 'll pray until we get this right . "   " Why do you want to teach school , Clay ? " Jackie asked . " Yeah , Tag , " Sammy added . " I ca n't wait to be done with school , and you want to be there every day , all day ! " Clayton smiled at her incredulous tone but admitted , " It 's just a dream I have . " His voice turned wistful . " I love kids , and I love the thought of seeing them discover new things . I think to teach a child is to touch his life and help him to go out into the world more prepared . " Jackie stopped and stared . Sammy halted on the hot , dusty street as well . The three of them were a block off the main street of town . June had already turned to July , and Clayton , whose shirt was damp with perspiration , had to squint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What did I say ? " he finally asked . Jackie shrugged . " I 've just never heard anyone talk about their work like that . For the first time I see how much this means to you . " Then you have n't been very observant , Miss Fontaine , " he teased her , " because I 've been going on about this for months . " Jackie playfully put her chin in the air and walked on . Clayton tugged on her hair as she passed , and Sammy only smiled . They both heard Jackie sigh . " We 'd better get back , Sammy . Father will think we 've left town . "  | " What will you do now , Tag ? " Sammy asked him . " Oh , I might get a haircut or just go to the livery and wait for Milton to finish the repairs on the wagon . " " I think you should come back to the store so we can put you to work , " Jackie told him . " Now who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . When they 'd arrived back at the main street , Clayton said , " I 'll see you two later . " He turned and waved . The girls did the same and moved on toward the store . When they arrived at the store , just a few doors down , Jackie hesitated before going inside . She stood at the hardware door and watched Clayton go up the street , the sun turning his hair a shiny gold color . He moved past the barber shop and into the livery . Sammy observed her sister 's actions , tilting her head to one side much like Eddie used to do . " Are you going to marry Clay , Jackie ? " Jackie immediately dropped her eyes but did not grow angry . " He does n't like me in that way , Sammy , " was all she would say . The younger girl did n't push the point . Jackie was relieved , but in her heart she was talking to Eddie as if she were present . I did it , Eddie . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , he 's wonderful to the people he cares for . Thanks , Eddie . Sammy had moved into the store , and Jackie now followed more slowly , still thinking it was wonderful to have Clayton as a friend . And somehow , at that very moment , Jackie knew they would be friends forever . The fact that he was getting ready to leave in just a little over a month was not to be considered ; Jackie had become very proficient at pushing it from her mind . She did so now as she went for the broom and began to work on the front walk . The calendar read July 9 , 1874 , almost a year to the day that the Fontaines had arrived in town . Addy gave strict instructions to the girls about the day 's activities before leaving for the store . Morgan had been suffering with a raging summer cold , and although  | he was feeling better , Addy actually convinced him to sleep in . Lexa would accompany her mother to the store , while the other girls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Addy and Lexa let themselves in the back door and found that all was quiet . Addy was n't certain but thought this might have been unusual . It seemed to her that Mitch was always up and around in the morning but tended to go to his apartment long before the store closed . Addy shrugged and got busy . Morgan enjoyed staying late and also coming in early . Mitch had surely begun to bank on that , and it gave him the freedom to lie  --  in once in a while . However , as the first hour of work progressed , Addy became uncomfortable . She did n't wish to disturb the older man , but something was not quite right . When there were no customers in the store , she moved to the stairs . " Lexa , " Addy called to her , " I 'm going to run up to your uncle 's for a moment . Be certain to stay out front . " " All right , Mother , " came the obedient reply as Lexa came from the rear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in the back door just seconds after Addy left , and Lexa calmly told him where her mother had gone . Morgan nodded , still feeling a little out of sorts . He had come , telling himself that he must not overly burden Addy and the store could n't run itself . " Mitch ? " Addy called softly as she knocked for the second time . There was still no answer . She bit her lip in indecision . She had never invaded his privacy before and only hoped as she turned the handle that he would understand her concern . " Mitch ? " she tried again , stepping into the hallway of his apartment . Things were dark and rather dreary for a summer day with all of the window coverings still drawn , but Addy knew where Mitch 's bedroom was and moved quietly past the sitting room to that doorway . The door stood wide open . She peered into the rather shadowy interior and tried one more time .  | " Mitch , are you all right ? " A low sound came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to the window . She drew back the heavy curtains on one window and then on the other before rushing to the bed . " Mitch ! " Addy 's voice was low and urgent . " What is it , Mitch ? " The old man rasped . " It was bad last night , Addy ... so bad . " " I 'll get help , Mitch . Just hold on . " Addy turned and fled the room . She dashed down the stairs , nearly falling in her haste and shouting to Lexa . " Go for the doctor , Lexa ! Hurry ! " She was turning to dash back up to Mitch when she spotted a thunderstruck Morgan . " Oh , Morgan , please come with me . Mitch is in a bad way . " She turned and ran once again to her brother-in-law 's side . He had n't moved in the bed at all . Addy grabbed a chair and positioned it close to his side . She bumped the edge of the mattress , and the old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Addy was barely holding her tears . " I did n't mean to disturb you . " Morgan had arrived as well and stood in the doorway , unnoticed by the two people within . " It 's all right , Addy . I need to rouse myself and talk to you . " " No , Mitch , " she protested . " Just rest . " His head moved on the pillow . " I have things to say . The medicine is no longer helping . It wo n't be long now . " Addy spotted the small vial on the room 's lone nightstand and realized that this was no passing illness . She recalled how poorly he looked just before and after the wedding , but he had seemed fine later . She was going to tell him to see the doctor , but suddenly there had n't seemed to be a need . ' Addy ? " " I 'm listening , Mitch . " Addy could say nothing else . " Make sure he knows . " " Morgan ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and money . I took too long to find out , but it 's true . Make sure he sees where his real treasure must be stored . "  | " I will . " Tears poured down Addy 's face . She reached to take Mitch 's hand . His grip was surprisingly strong , and Addy wanted to sob . " Tell the girls I love them , " he managed . Before Addy could assure him , old Doc Edwardson came through the door . He moved silently to the bed and picked up Mitch 's wrist . The dying man struggled to open his eyes and look at him . " You 've been a horrible patient , " the doctor scolded him gently . " You were supposed to come back and see me . " " Did n't need to . I still had medicine . " The doctor only grunted in reply . Suddenly Mitch grabbed his hand . " Make sure Addy knows that I love her , Ed , and the girls too . " Doc Edwardson squeezed his patient 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a thousand times . " Mitch seemed to remember suddenly that Addy was there and turned to her . " It 's meant so much to have you here , Addy . I ca n't say Addy was sobbing now , feeling like her heart was going to burst , but still managed to reply , " I 'm not ready for you to go , Mitch . " " I know , Addy . That 's why you 've got to make Morgan see . " The doctor , moving his head to look at the man still framed in the doorway , brought Addy 's head around as well . " Oh , Morgan , " she said softly . " You 're here . He 's here , Mitch , " Addy said , turning back to him . " You can tell him . " Feeling like a man in a nightmare , Morgan came forward awkwardly . He knew his brother had n't been doing well and that he 'd been tired lately , but death had never occurred to him . It just could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he forced himself to sit on the edge of the bed . Mitch immediately reached for his hand , and Morgan grasped his firmly . " I could n't ruin the wedding , " Mitch got out . " God brought you here so I could tell you the way , but you have n't listened . Addy understands , Morgan . Do n't let your pride send you to hell . Ask her . Ask her today . "  | His breath left him with those words , and Addy heard a so disturbance at the door . Her four daughters stood looking in , the eyes wide with fear and tears . Addy motioned them to the foot the bed . " The girls are here , Mitch , " Addy told him gently . " Good , " he gasped . " Tell them , Addy . Tell them how much th Uncle Mitch loved them . Eddie and Robert too . " His eyes fluttered , and Addy 's panicked gaze flew to Doc wardson , but he was taking Mitch 's pulse . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but it won be long . " A shudder ran over Addy 's frame . She wanted to cry , but she also wanted to be aware of everything . If she let herself go , she might miss someone needing her . She asked God for wisdom right then . This was so clearly His timing , and Addy , even in her grief , desperately wanted to be used to see to His work . A moment passed before she could find her voice , but a few seconds later she began to recite . " The Lord is my shepherd ; I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures ; he leadeth me beside the still waters . He restoreth my soul . " All four girls joined her , their voices soft in the hushed room . " He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name 's sake . Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil ; for thou art with me ; thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table before me in the presence of mine enemies ; thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over . Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life ; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever . " ' Amen , " Doc Edwardson spoke solemnly , and the girls moved around the bed to be near their mother . They would have gone to their father , but he looked carved from stone . They all watched as Uncle Mitch moved slightly on the bed . He did n't thrash . His arm raised in seeming agitation , his breath came in a gasp , but his eyes remained closed . His hand then went to his chest , clutching at his nightshirt . Tears filled Addy 's eyes once again  | she thought he might be in pain . A second later he lay cornrely still . Doc Edwardson moved to the bed one more time . He held itch 's wrist for a long time and then gently laid the limp hand the old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 . Addy was openly sobbing now , and so were the girls . Only the Id doctor heard Morgan 's hoarse voice when he said , " Goodbye , itch . "  | It seemed that every resident of Georgetown turned out f the funeral of Mitchell Fontaine . Pastor Munroe held the service at the graveside , and it was to God 's glory that he was able to poi out the basis for the differences in Mitch 's behavior in the last f years . His voice was kind as he spoke , but his words carried gr weight . " I could stand here and tell you that Mitch was a good man , and it would be true . I might also tell you that because he was good , we know he is in heaven , but there I must draw the line . Mitchell Fontaine is not in heaven because of anything he did . Mitch is in heaven because of his belief in Jesus Christ and His saving work on the cross . You may not want to hear or accept this  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it was too late . " Pastor Munroe talked a little bit about Mitch 's life in Georgetown . He 'd come to the area with his wife in 1859 . At that time Georgetown was little more than a settlement of miners gathered along Clear Creek to prospect . The pastor told of some of the civic ? minded projects Mitch had been involved with , and with his eyes on the crowd , some of whom were the wealthiest mine owners in town , he ended with yet another word about Mitch 's decision , urging anyone in need to come to him . " There will be some of you who think I only want more money for the church , but nothing could be further from the truth . Our church building does have some minor needs , but nothing compares to the need for all of you to know Christ . "  | Long after the crowd had pressed close to share their regrets and then moved on their way , the Fontaines stood by the grave . Sammy was inconsolable for many minutes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 's going to be so upset , and she 's so far away . I have to see Eddie . " She sobbed uncontrollably against Danny 's side . Not even her father , lifting her in his arms , could abate the storm . " She has Robert . " Addy came close to her husband 's shoulder in an attempt to console her youngest daughter . " He 'll take care of her . " " I know , Mother , " Sammy replied , the tears still falling , " but she 's so far away , and I know she 'll be just crushed when she hears . " And indeed Sammy was correct . Eddie was very upset to hear of her uncle 's passing . Robert delivered the telegram himself and held her while she sobbed . However , Eddie 's greatest tears were for her father . " I do n't know what he 'll do now , Robert , " she cried . " He 's lived with Mother for so long , and nothing has ever touched him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped , is gone . " " We ca n't stop trusting , Eddie . God will find a way . He always does . " Eddie continued to cry in her husband 's arms , but she prayed as well . She prayed with all of her heart that her father would be touched . If she could only have seen through the walls of her parents ' bedroom the next night , she 'd have prayed for her mother as well . Mitch had been buried for little more than 48 hours when Morgan responded to the things his brother had said . His response was not volcanic , but it was unsettling to Addy . They were getting ready for bed , and Addy could feel his tension from across the room . " That 's a fine way to end things with my brother . " The statement came from out of nowhere . Addy turned , her blouse clutched in her hands .  | " What do you mean ? " " I mean , " Morgan replied as he nearly tore his necktie off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his deathbed that he thinks deserve to go to hell . " Addy forced herself to hang the blouse in the closet . " That isn what he said , Morgan . " " Oh , really . " Morgan 's sarcasm was biting . " Just exactly what did he mean ? He seemed to think that you would have all the answers , so why do n't you tell me just exactly what my brother meant . ' " I do n't think you 're in any mood to hear it . " " Do n't patronize me ! " The words were like a lash , but Addy remained outwardly calm as she turned to him . " My grief is as great as yours , Morgan . Please do n't take this out on me . " Addy turned away and unbuttoned her skirt . Morgan watched her . He wanted answers , but he was so angry that he could have put his fist through a wall . He was still just standing and staring , the tie dangling from his fingers , when Addy began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her routine kept her from bursting into tears . She was nearly done with her hair when Morgan forced himself to speak calmly . " What did Mitch mean when he said my pride would send me to hell ? " Addy turned away from the mirror . " I believe he was speaking to the fact that you think all good , hardworking people go to heaven . " " What 's wrong with that ? " " It 's not true , Morgan ; that 's what 's wrong with it . " " How can you say that ? " " I do n't say it . " Addy kept her voice neutral . " The Bible says it . " " So you 're telling me , " Morgan returned , his voice was filling with rage all over again , " that all I 've done , all I 've worked for my whole life , is n't worth a thing ? " " Morgan , are you sure you want to talk about this ? " " Yes !  | Addy started and wished she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised just enough to speak boldly . She knew this was not the right time  --  his grief was too fresh  --  but if Morgan wanted it , she would give it to him . " Nothing we do outside of Christ is worth a thing . Outside of Christ it 's all useless . " Addy 's hand went into the air when Morgan opened his mouth . ' And do n't you dare ask me , Morgan , why I think you are outside of Christ . You know very well that something is missing in your life . " Morgan 's eyes were fierce at this point , but Addy kept on . It was a temptation to rail at God for putting her in this position , but she thought she might have been too passive in the past . With a deep breath she continued . " You go into church with your family well dressed and well behaved and line them up in a row and hope that God notices . You actually tell the girls that God is impressed if we 're on time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Bible looks like the day I gave it to you . The Bible says , in 2 Corinthians 5 , If any man be in Christ he is a new creature ; old things have passed away ; behold all things are become new . ' If that has n't happened to you , Morgan , then Mitch is indeed right . You 're going to hell . " Morgan 's gaze could have drilled holes into Addy . He wanted to storm from the room , but his feet would n't move . How could she say this to him ? He 'd worked hard and been a fine provider . His eye did n't stray . What man was n't tempted by the sight of a beautiful woman ? But he had been faithful to Addy since the day he met her . " Morgan , " Addy 's voice came softly to his ears . " It has to be God 's way . All the girls came to Christ as little children because it 's the easier way . We get older and our pride gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to come to Him . Only it wo n't work . He makes the call , and if we do n't abide by it we 're lost . " " So you think I 'm a failure ? " Addy felt defeat wash over her . It was as if he did n't have a clue . She went to him and held his face in her hands .  | " Morgan , you 've been a wonderful husband and father , and you will go on being so , but something is missing . I think you can feel it , but you do n't want to acknowledge it . All I 'm asking is that you keep your mind open . You 're so certain you have all the answers that you do n't even listen . Pastor Munroe is not to be merely tolerated ; he 's there to teach us . The next time he speaks about heaven and how to get there , listen with your whole heart . " The room was shadowy , but he could see tears standing in Addy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tremble , or was that his own body ? Could he really be wrong after all these years ? And if he was , did good people really go to hell ? Morgan 's eyes shut in agony . He 'd been so sure , and now his soul was in mis-ery . Better misery now , Morgan , than an eternity in hell . Where the thought came from Morgan could n't say , but he was going to listen , this much was sure . He now tightened his arms around his wife , desperately needing to feel her close . He was scared . Like a child alone in a dark forest , he was terrified . It was a new sensation for him , and right now Addy seemed to be all that was real . He held onto her with a new desperation , not talking , just needing to have her close . " You heard baby birds ? " one little girl asked another . " Yes . I know it 's late , but they must have just hatched . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . " " Well , I was late getting home , so I had to cut across . " " Did your mother find out ? " " No . " The girls moved on , but their words echoed in Jackie 's ears . Baby birds in Henderson 's field . She knew where that was . And in July ! Jackie glanced at the big clock on the wall . It was 1:15 . She was done in the store today at 2:30 . She had some chores to do at home , but she was certain she could work in a trip to see the birds '  | nest and still arrive home in plenty of time to do them . Henderson 's property was off the beaten path , but it would be worth the walk . Jackie suddenly looked down at her dress and scowled . What in the world had possessed her to wear something so dressy to work ? The lavender fabric even had a row of snow-white lace a foot up from the hem ! She continued to scowl at her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wistfulness . She knew very well why she 'd dressed up . She had n't seen Clayton since right after Uncle Mitch 's funeral and hoped beyond all hope that he would make an appearance today . So far it had n't hap-pened . " Jack , " her father 's voice suddenly snatched her out of her dreams . " Yes ? " " Take this in the back and put it on the shelf with the others . " Morgan handed her a small satchel . " We have enough out front already . When you 're through with that , sweep the front walk . " " All right . " " When are you done today ? " His question stopped her before she could move six feet . Jackie turned back , her heart beating with sudden fear . " Two-thirty . " ' All right , " Morgan said as he turned away . Jackie 's breath returned in a rush . She had thought he was going to say she needed to stay late . Her step was light as she moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the straw broom in her hand . Two hours later , puffing from the warmth of her dress and the exertion , Jackie stopped below the tree in Henderson 's field . There was only one , and she had to climb a fence to get to it , but she had arrived . She stood very still to calm her breathing , and then she heard them : Baby birds chirping and crying out to be fed . She stepped immediately underneath the overhanging branches and strained to see the nest . It was too high .  | She knew they would be cute , and she had such a soft spot for baby animals . However , if she tore this dress , her mother would not be pleased . " But if I do n't see the nest , " Jackie now spoke to the tree . " I 've come all this way for nothing . " " Talking to yourself , Jackie ? " Jackie spun in surprise toward the voice and smiled as she spotted Clayton . He sat atop his horse , Miner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what makes you think I 'm alone , " Jackie asked with a flirting glance . She started toward him . " There might be a handsome young man courting me from the tree . " He spoke when she 'd stopped at the fence and looked up at him , her eyes sparkling with good humor . " Now , " Clayton drawled charmingly , " I would n't be calling you a liar , Miss Fontaine , but I think the only company you have out here is Henderson 's bull . " " Is that right ? " She sounded quite skeptical . " I think you might be doing the lying , Mr. Taggart . I have n't seen a bull . " Clayton 's humor fell away . " He does have a bull , Jackie . I do n't know if he 's out right now , but Henderson does pen a bull in this field . " " Oh . " Jackie turned serious , and looked in all directions behind her . She still did n't see anything , but the little girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How 'd you get in there ? " Clayton suddenly asked , shifting in his saddle to scan the fence line . He spotted the gate across the way . " Now that would be telling , " Jackie said , but she was looking away . She could feel her cheeks heating . Indeed , she had climbed over at a low spot in the fence but did n't care to admit this . " Do you want some help getting out ? " " No , thank you . " Jackie tried to sound nonchalant , but when she finally looked at him , she found he was eyeing her strangely . She watched as he pushed his hat back on his head . " Everything okay ? "  | " Yeah . " Jackie 's eyes were huge , and she could feel her face going red all over again . Clayton felt hesitant to leave her but told himself he 'd have to take her at her word . She was acting very embarrassed about something , but he could n't imagine what . He wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man . It would certainly account for her behavior , but within Henderson 's fence ? The guy must not be very romantic . " You 're sure you 're okay ? " " I 'm sure . " " I best be off then . " Clayton adjusted his hat low over his forehead again . " I 'll see you later , Jackie . " " Bye , Clay , " Jackie said with a smile and then stood very still as he moved away . She sighed softly as the horse took his broad back out of view . She turned back to the tree , but suddenly the thought of seeing the birds was n't all that enticing . If Clayton had stayed to see them with her , she would have enjoyed it , but telling him the reason she 'd come this far out had seemed so childish . Jackie stood below the tree and listened to the sound of chirping again . She reminded herself again that the tree would tear her dress if she tried to climb it , so with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she had come . The tree was a little farther than the fence when she heard the hoofbeats , but she panicked at the sight of a bull charging her and turned to run like the wind back to the haven of its branches . She swung herself up into the limbs with an agility she did n't know she possessed and watched with horrified eyes as the bull ran a ways past the tree , snorting and stomping and looking for her . Jackie was afraid to breathe . She moved only her head to see his every move , but the bull soon lost interest and wandered a short way off to graze . Jackie would have groaned if she had n't been so afraid . How would she ever get home ? Not even the sight of the birds , which she finally remembered to look at , could cheer her . She tried to gauge just how fast she could run compared to the distance to the fence , but knew it was foolhardy in long skirts . She  | shifted around a bit in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch gave way beneath her foot and for a second she was hurtling toward the ground . She stopped with a loud scream as she was driven pencil  --  like into a small square of branches . Her legs felt scraped , and she could feel that her skirts were twisted tightly around her knees , baring her stocking  --  clad legs from the calves down . As soon as she landed she pressed her hand tightly over her mouth to keep from howling again . Her scream had alerted the bull , and he was back under the tree , looking in all directions . Jackie was sure if he looked up and spotted her he could stab her foot with his horn , so she did n't move a muscle  --  not even when a tear trickled down her face . She kept herself frozen until he once again moved on his way . With that her mind began to move as well , and the thoughts were not happy . The image of being stranded here after dark , left alone in the blackness , was enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it would have helped she would have shouted with all of her voice for her father . Indeed , she was on the verge of doing this when a tiny peep from the nest diverted her . Jackie looked at them and knew they were getting hungry . The mother was naturally frightened away by her presence . They ca n't even get their dinner until I 'm out of here , she thought miserably . What in the world am I going to do  --  A tear came , and then another , but no answers . The wind blew through the tree just then , a cool wind , and Jackie shivered from more than just the cold . When the temperature dropped in Georgetown , nighttime was on its way . Jackie tried to move her legs , but she was jammed tight , and it hurt to shift even a little . Not bothering to subdue the noise this time , her tears came in a torrent of weeping . She was going to be stuck in the tree all night .  | " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left right at 2:30 . " " Thank you , Lexa , " Addy spoke from her place near the oven . Danny came into the room just then . " Danny , have you seen Jackie ? " " No , not all afternoon . " Addy bit her lip for just an instant . " Danny , " she said , " run over to the Taggarts ' and ask there , will you ? Come right back and tell me whether she 's been there or not . " All right , Mother . " She left and Addy gave way to her concern , her face mirroring the anxiety within until she realized both Sammy and Lexa were watching her . " Are you worried , Mother ? " " A little , " she admitted , trying to smile . " It 's nearly dark , and Jackie always does her chores . " The younger girls nodded and exchanged a glance . Danny had exited a few minutes before , but every heart was with her as she walked down the road to the Taggart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just come in from outside to find Milly and his mother standing close by the front door . Elaine turned to him . " Danny was just here looking for Jackie . " She sounded preoccupied with her thoughts and did n't really notice the way Clayton tensed . " She was finished at the store at 2:30 , " Milly added , " but no one 's seen her since . " Even as she spoke , Clayton was reaching for the hat he 'd just set down . " Go to the Fontaines , Milly . Tell them I saw her in Hen-derson 's field this afternoon . If I 'm not back here within a half hour , send help . " " Clayton , " Elaine called before he could leave . " Yes , " he answered , stopping with his hand on the knob . She looked frightened but managed , " Are you thinking she 's been hurt ? I mean , Henderson 's bull is ? " " I do n't know , Mom , " he cut her off gently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out . " Elaine had little choice but to let him go , but the direction of her thoughts caused her to tremble . Milly went out the front door at the same time to take word to the Fontaines . Elaine , a dishtowel still in her hand , sank down at the kitchen table to pray . Jackie had been trying to pray for hours , but her mind was going numb . The light was already so dim that the mountains that rimmed the valley were beginning to lose shape . Evening was falling and her panic caused her to lose all reason . It even took a moment for her to hear the hoofbeats over the pounding of the blood in her ears . She twisted around frantically to see who was coming and nearly went to pieces when the rider came close but began to move away . " Father ? " she cried in a pitiful squeak . " Is that you , Father ? " " Jackie ? " It was Clayton 's voice . " Clay . Oh , Clay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where are you ? " " In the tree , " she said before the tears came and took her voice away . She cried with relief but also pain . Her legs were in agony . Her legs ! The words shouted in her head . This was not her father coming , but Clayton , and her white  --  stockinged legs were exposed like a picture she 'd seen one time of a dance-hall girl . In the midst of all these tumultuous thoughts , she heard the horse draw near . Clayton must have come inside the fence . A moment later she looked down and saw him below her . " Are you all right ? " he asked . " No , I 'm not , " she told him , sniffing . " It 's getting dark , and I ca n't get free . " " Here . " Clayton had moved until he was directly below her feet . " If I push your feet up , maybe you can grab the branch above you . Can you try ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each palm and pushed . The position was nearly impossible for leverage , but it gave Jackie just enough room to work . One foot lifted away from him to step on a strong branch and then the other followed . Clayton backed Miner off so he was n't directly below her and then looked up to see her progress . She was standing easily now , but she was so far off the ground that he knew she should n't jump . Clayton moved in yet again . " Here , Jackie , come down to this branch and then step down to me . " " Where 's the bull ? " Her voice wobbled . " I ca n't see him right now . " Clayton ducked his head to look around the field . " He must have wandered off . Go ahead and jump to me . " Jackie finally heard what he had said to her . " You mean onto the horse ? " " Yes . I 'll catch you . " " Oh , Clay . . . " Jackie 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he coaxed , and after several minutes ' worth of soothing words she jumped . Clayton caught her just as he 'd prom-  | ised and settled her across the front of the saddle . She was trembling violently , and for a moment he kept his arms around her . " Are you okay ? " " I just wanted to see the birds , " she stuttered . " And then the bull came and my dress caught and they could n't eat ! " She was gripping his hand hard now . " They could n't even eat while I was there , and they sounded so hungry . " It was too much for Jackie . She buried her face in her grubby hands and sobbed . Clayton knew it was time to get home . He heeled Miner forward to the gate and left the pasture . Jackie 's shoulder was against his chest , and she was still crying into her hands . He did n't know what to say . Horrible images had flashed through his mind as he 'd ridden to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have met some young man who tried to hurt her , and here she had only innocently come to see a bird 's nest and ended up being chased by a bull . " It 's all right , Jackie , " Clayton said when she began to calm . He looked up to see a rider coming toward them . " I think your father is coming . " Jackie 's head snapped up . It was indeed Morgan . " Please let me down , Clayton . " Clayton stopped immediately and helped Jackie to the ground . Her legs nearly buckled , and he leaned to keep hold of her hands , but a moment later he watched as she flew toward her father . The older man had come off his horse , and Clayton could hear her cries from dozens of yards away as Morgan held and comforted his daughter . " It was getting dark , " he heard her gasp as he drew near . " I know , but I 've got you now , Jack . " Morgan looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . The bull chased her , and then she could n't get out of the tree . " Morgan nodded , but darkness was falling fast now , and Clayton could see him only dimly . " I 'll get home now , " Clayton said , " before anyone worries any longer . "  | " Thank you , Clay , " Morgan said simply . Because Jackie 's legs still hurt , Morgan lifted her onto the horse . He led the animal home rather than sit with her , talking in calm tones as they moved . As soon as they arrived , Addy put Jackie to bed . She hovered over her for a long time and left a light burning in her room until she had fallen asleep . Addy still did n't know exactly what had happened , but at the moment it did n't matter . Some of the lace on Jackie 's dress was torn , but she was home safe , and they could all start to breathe again . " Hello . " The word came quietly from Clayton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room . It was the afternoon of the next day . Jackie had heard her mother open the front door but had n't heard the voices . She should have been working at the store this day , but her father had insisted she stay home . " Hello , Clay , " Jackie returned , putting her book aside . " I came to see how you were doing . " He sat in the chair across from her and thought she looked a little pale . " I 'm all right , but I managed to scare the life out of my father . He wants me to take it easy for a few days . " " That 's not a bad idea , " Clayton agreed , but Jackie only shrugged . " What are you doing today ? " " Not much . My dad is due in any time , and when he comes back we 'll be headed back out . " " You do n't usually wait for him , do you ? " " No , but unless he needs me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave here in three weeks , and I want to spend as much time as possible at home . " " Three weeks ? " Jackie questioned him quietly . " I thought you would be here until the end of August . " " No . I 've decided to go earlier . " It was a good thing that Jackie 's face was already pale , or Clayton might have questioned her more than he did . His simple words  | were enough to make her want to howl with dismay . He was going away . Not in six weeks , but in three . What in the world would she do ? " Are you sure you 're all right ? " Clayton asked . " Yeah , " Jackie lied , forcing a smile . " Thanks for coming to the rescue last night . " She was pleased with her quick recovery . " I was n't certain if I 'd thanked you . It was so silly to be caught in that tree , and well , thanks , Clay . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her strained features were from thoughts about the night before . For a moment his mind dwelt on the whole incident . " Why does the darkness frighten you ? " Clayton watched her frown and look a bit irritated . He wished he had kept the question to himself . " Were you hurt ? " he asked to fill the breech . " Only some scratches on my legs . " Jackie 's face was expressionless , the irritation gone . " I 'm glad it was nothing worse . " The conversation was trailing off , and Jackie simply did n't have the stamina to keep things going . Usually all she had to do was ask Clayton about school and he would start talking fifteen to the dozen , but if she even thought about his schooling right now or how she 'd felt the night before , she was going to burst into tears . It was n't a surprise that Clayton rose to leave just a few minutes later . " I think I 'd best get on my way , Jackie . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " Yesterday was a long day . " " Well , take it easy . I 'll see you later . " " Bye , Clay . " Jackie sat for a long time after he left . In fact , she was so quiet that Addy forgot she was even home . She wandered past the living room a little later and started in surprise . " Jackie , " she said with a hand on her heart . " You 're so quiet that I forgot all about you . " It was then she saw the tears in her daughter 's eyes .  | " What is it , honey ? " " He 's leaving , Mother . In three weeks he 's leaving . I thought it was six , but it 's only three . " Addy came close now and sat on the arm of Jackie 's chair . She could n't find any words , but it did n't seem to matter . Jackie buried her face in her mother 's lap and sobbed . The next day began like any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little quieter than usual . Both of the children noticed but did n't comment . They missed their father as well , and talking about it would n't bring anything more than tears . They both went about their daily chores with quiet efficiency . Elaine was thankful for their lack of intrusion , because in truth she did not want to share what was on her heart . She had woken early , around 4:00 A.M. , with an awful sense of pain . She was n't actually hurting , but her breathing felt constricted and her body ached all over . She rose very quietly and checked on Clayton and Milly . When she found them both sleeping soundly , she returned to her bedroom to pray . She was well , and her children were unharmed , so it had to be something else . Elaine had experienced this feeling once before  --  it was over five years ago now . Kevin had been late , and when he 'd finally arrived home , she learned he 'd been bitten by a rattlesnake . His leg was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a week . Now the feeling was on her again . Elaine knelt by the bed she shared with her husband and let her head fall on his pillow . I can feel something is amiss , Lord , she prayed in her heart . I am not given to flights of fancy , but I know Kevin is hurt . He may even be with You right now . I trust You , Father . Give me the grace to make it through whatever You have for us . I would want him back , You know this , but You also know what 's best . Help the children in this , Lord . Help them to keep trusting You no matter what .  | A tear slid down her face , a tear of pain for the man she loved . She hated the thought of his being alone and hurting , so she prayed that if he was injured , someone would find him soon . I would like to see him one more time , Lord . I admit this freely to You , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe . Touch Kevin now , Father . Help him to keep his eyes firmly fixed on You , no matter what the pain or circumstances . When it was time for breakfast , Elaine rose stiffly from the floor to dress for the day , but she prayed often as the day progressed . In fact , she prayed constantly . It was just after lunch before she had any real idea as to why she felt so burdened . Cormac O'Brien pulled into the yard with his longbed wagon . Kevin 's horse was tied to the back , and Kevin lay in the wagon bed . There was no color in Elaine 's face as she took in the sight of her husband 's body , but seeing him did n't paralyze her . Cormac was talking , and she was listening to every word and already moving to do what had to be done . " They brought him in in the back of a wagon . " " Is he dead ? " " I think he might be . Clayton was uptown , and Paddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sound of Clayton 's name brought Jackie 's head around . Fontaine 's General Store was filled with almost as much gossip as the barber shop , and Jackie had already learned to block out most of it . However , Clayton 's name was another matter . " What happened ? " Jackie broke a firm rule and intruded into the conversation . " Kevin Taggart 's been hurt , or maybe killed . They 've sent for the doc . " " How ? " " I do n't know , dear , but land surveyors live a dangerous life . He could have fallen or been attacked by a wild animal . "  | The older woman who was speaking finished her sentence , but Jackie did n't hear . She was already moving to find her father . " Father , I have to go to the Taggarts ' . Mr. Taggart has been hurt , and I have to see if they need me . " " Your mother was just here and told me , Jack . She 'll go and see what needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Jackie grabbed his arm with bruising strength . " Father , " she spoke , her heart in her eyes . " I have to go . " Morgan looked down into her face and saw that it was true . She looked ready to come undone if he turned her down . And anyway , if she was that determined to go , she would be of no use in the store . " All right , Jack . " The words were barely out of his mouth before Jackie ran for the door . Her father called something after her , but she never heard . Her mind was already at the Taggarts ' wondering how she could be of the most help .  | Jackie knew better than to knock at the front door and disturb the goings-on within , but neither was she comfortable just walking inside Clayton 's house . It was for this reason that she stood outside for quite some time and prayed . " Please , God , " she said softly . " Show me how I can help here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doubts began to assail her . Reaching out to others was so new to Jackie that she did n't know where to start . Eddie and her mother always knew what to do , as did Danny , but Jackie was a complete novice . Jackie did n't know if she 'd have made it inside at all , but Paddy 's father chose that moment to come out . " No need to knock , Jackie , " he spoke kindly to her in his thick brogue . " Just go on in . " " Thank you , Mr. O'Brien . " Jackie smiled with genuine relief and slipped inside . The living room was empty , and surprisingly , so was the kitchen . Jackie could hear voices in the rooms upstairs , but she could n't make herself go up those steps . She was casting her eyes around the room , still praying for help , when she spied the coffeepot . It was cold to the touch and not very full . Jackie fought back tears of relief . This she could do . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born of years of practice , she made the coffee . From there she searched for food and began to cut vegetables for a soup . She had just started  | it in a big pot on the stove when she heard someone on the stairs . Milly came partway into the room and stopped in surprise when she saw her . " Hello , Milly . " " Hi , Jackie . " Her voice told of her wonder . " I ... um . . . just came to see if I could help . I took it upon myself to make some coffee and start some dinner . It 's just soup , vegetable soup . " " Thank you . " " Would you like some coffee ? " Milly could only nod before she sank into a kitchen chair . Jackie poured her some coffee and sat across from her . " Is your father going to be all right , Milly ? " " They do n't know , " she whispered . " His horse stumbled and rolled . It rolled right on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ca n't feel his legs . " " Oh , Milly . " " He says he wishes he were in pain . He said it would n't be so scary that way . " With that , Milly buried her face in her hands and sobbed . Jackie fought her own tears and pulled a handkerchief from the pocket of her skirt . She pressed it into Milly 's hands . Milly worked at controlling herself , but it took a moment . After that they sat in silence with their coffee , a bit uncomfortable , but not as strained as usual . Addy and Elaine came down the stairs a little later . The girls heard them talking as they came . " He has n't eaten for two days , but the doctor says to take it easy . No meat , and maybe a little bit of soup . " " I 'll start that for you , Elaine , " Addy offered . " Jackie put soup on , " Milly said , breaking into their conversation . Both women stopped and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red . " It 's not very fancy . " Her hands moved nervously . " Thank you , Jackie , " Elaine told her sincerely .  | Jackie looked over to see her mother smiling . It was a proud smile , and once again Jackie fought her tears . She had n't felt this emotional since Eddie and Robert 's departure or Uncle Mitch 's death . As soon as the Fontaine women were certain that everything was under control , they left . Addy explained to Jackie on the walk home that all they could do was wait . It was everyone 's prayer that Kevin would regain some sensation in his legs , but right now , they waited . Jackie fretted about how she could help , but almost of its own course , a pattern had been started . Jackie could be found at the Taggart home morning , noon , and evening . If she found dishes , she washed them . If coffee was needed , she made it , along with breakfast , lunch , or dinner . And when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was home in her own kitchen baking cookies or bread to take to them . If she arrived and there was nothing to be done , she left as quietly as she had come . The Taggart family rarely saw her , only evidence that she 'd been there . One evening , about ten days into this schedule , Jackie was still finishing up in the kitchen when Elaine and Clayton arrived on the scene . They 'd both been upstairs , and Jackie was a bit flustered in Clayton 's presence . She was glad to be able to say she was on her way out the door . " Please walk Jackie home , Clay , " Elaine said after she 'd thanked the young woman . " Oh , no , " Jackie protested softly . " I 'll be fine . " But Clayton was already reaching for his hat , and Jackie did not want to make a scene . They walked silently out the front door . Jackie felt a little silly . It was n't even dark yet . " There really is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be close to your family , and I can get home alone . " Clayton suddenly stopped on the road , and Jackie stopped beside him . He looked down at her . Jackie wished she could read his thoughts . " I have n't thanked you , " he said with surprise . " For what ? "  | " For all your help at the house . " Embarrassed , Jackie shrugged and started to turn away . Clayton caught her arm . He held it for just a moment , and then let his hand drop . His eyes now lifted to the craggy , snow  --  topped moun-tains . " I never dreamed of how it might feel to see my father laid up . I mean , he 's always been the strong one . " He looked back at Jackie . " My world has become that bedroom , Jackie . I sit in there most of the day , and when I go downstairs to my bedroom I think about being in there most of the night . " Jackie saw for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so much . He may never walk again , but he still has a smile on his face and praise for God when he speaks . Do you know what he said to me last night ? " Jackie was forced to shake her head , but her eyes encouraged him . " He said , I may have lost the use of my legs , Clay , but my soul still has wings . ' " Tears filled Clayton 's eyes . " Why did n't we take the time before to really study God 's Word , Jackie ? I mean , we 've always had Bible time before breakfast , but not like this , not with such depth and meaning . " A tear spilled over . " Why did it take his getting hurt for me to see how important it is ? " Clayton 's hand came to his face as he tried to quell the flood , but his tears would not be stopped . Jackie wanted to die with the pain of it . Her friend was hurting , and she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but pulled back , afraid that her gesture would be taken wrong . A moment later , Clayton 's tears subsided , but his breathing was still hoarse and deep . He had n't looked at Jackie , but now he did . To his amazement , he felt no shame . She stood looking at him , her expression tender and tears filling her own lovely eyes . " You 're a good friend , Jackie Fontaine . " " You are too , Clay . I just wish I could do more . " " You 've been a great help . " Jackie nodded . " Please tell your father that I 'm praying for him . " " I 'll do that . "  | " Go on home now , Clay . I 'll get myself home . " " All right . " Jackie turned and started away and did n't look back . However , she knew that Clayton stood on the road and watched until she reached her own yard . Jackie was n't the least bit hungry when she arrived so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took time to pray for Mr. Taggart , but her mind kept going back to what Clayton had said . Her family never read the Bible together . In their family spending time with God 's Word was up to each person , and the truth was , Jackie had never taken an interest in her Bible . Not like her mother and Eddie always did , and certainly not like Clayton and his father . For the first time in years she pulled it out and turned to a place in Jeremiah . There was a little marker at that spot , and she tried to remember why it was there . She read it to see if she could find a clue . Starting in chapter 23 , verse 19 , she read softly aloud , " Behold , a whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in fury , even a grievous whirlwind ; it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked . The anger of the Lord shall not return , until he have executed , and till he have performed the thoughts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it perfectly . I have not sent these prophets , yet they ran ; I have not spoken to them , yet they prophesied . But if they had stood in my counsel , and had caused my people to hear my words , then they should have turned them from their evil way , and from the evil of their doings . Am I a God at hand , saith the Lord , and not a God afar off ? Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see Him ? saith the Lord . Do not I fill heaven and earth ? saith the Lord . " Jackie did not understand much of what she read , but one thing had jumped out at her . Was God a far-off God , or was He near ? Most times she would say He was very far off , but she closed her  | Bible and went to join her family before she could really gain an answer . " I want you to go to school . " " No . " For the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not asking you , Clay . I 'm telling you . Go to school . " " Absolutely not . " " It starts next week , Clay . I 'm sure I wo n't be laid up here forever , and you 've got to get there . " Clayton shook his head . His voice was gentle , but he held his jaw at a stubborn angle . " I 'm going back to work tomorrow , and that 's the end of it . " " We do n't need the money , " Kevin said , but he knew it was a half-truth . Clayton looked clearly skeptical . " We 're good for a time , Clay . Please do as I ask you . " Clayton shook is head . " It 's foolish to deplete your savings account when I 'm capable of supporting this family . " " You 're not touching your money for school , Clay . " Kevin 's voice went up a notch . " Do you hear me ? " " I 'm not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cormac tomorrow , and that 's final . " Kevin opened his mouth to say more , but Clayton turned away . He did n't look at his mother or father , but both heard him on the stairs and then closing the front door . " Elaine . " Kevin was reaching for her , panic on his face . " Make him go to Denver , Elaine . " She saw the tears in his eyes . " He 's waited for so long . Make him see . He 's got to go . Please , Elaine . " Elaine sat down on the bed and leaned over to put her arms around him . She had never seen Kevin like this  --  so helpless and weak . It had been six weeks since he 'd been put in this bed , and he had n't moved from it . However , this was a blow that was harder to take than the accident itself . It had never occurred to Kevin that  | Clayton would change his mind about school . Elaine waited until she thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his eyes , he still looked desperate . Tears came to Elaine 's own eyes as she slowly shook her head . " I ca n't tell him to go , Kevin , anymore than I could leave you myself . " " Oh , Elaine . " This was too much for him . Tears racked the body that was already becoming flaccid and weak , and Elaine held onto him with all her strength . " He 's dreamed for so long , " Kevin cried , " and stayed to work long past the time he first knew he wanted to teach . I just ca n't stand the thought that he 's staying for me . " Elaine smoothed the hair off his brow . They had washed his hair just that morning , and the effort had exhausted him . Not many hours later , Clayton had come to say he was going back out to work . " It 's not forever , Kevin , " Elaine soothed . " If God wants him at school , God will show us the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elaine cut him off . " No , Kevin , you 're not thinking clearly . If he goes , then Milly and I must go to work , or we 'll be forced to use up all the money in the savings account . What will we do after it 's gone ? It would be even harder to call Clayton home , I think , than for him not to go at all . " Her calm voice got through . She was right , of course , and he had to confess the panic and lack of trust . However , his mind was still praying , and a moment later he asked Elaine to write a letter for him . " To whom ? " she asked when she had sat close to Kevin , paper and ink at hand . " My mother . " The married couple exchanged a long look . " You want to know more about the position ? " Kevin nodded . " I would do anything for you and the kids . " " Even this , Kevin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , he began to dictate . Elaine took down every word her smooth hand . However , her heart was beating fast . The contents of this letter could change their lives forever , but on sec-d thought , Elaine realized that had already happened .  | Morgan walked away from the Taggart home , doing his best not to think . He knew it was cowardice , but right now he did n't think he could handle his own thoughts . How in the world did a man praise God after he 'd been broken and laid down ? Morgan could not even imagine , but that was exactly what he 'd witnessed . Determined to apologize for not coming sooner , Morgan had gone to see Kevin to cheer up the bedridden man , but it had n't gone anything like the way he planned . " There was no warning , " Kevin had told him . " One moment I was in the saddle , and the next instant we were falling . It must have been a deep hole . I 'm surprised my horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much pain to really analyze what was happening . " At that point a peaceful smile had come over Kevin 's face . " Not that it really matters , " he went on softly . " I 'm alive , and we 're praying every day for my recovery . " Such talk always made Morgan uncomfortable . Praying was the pastor 's job . But Kevin was n't through . " But I 'll tell you , Morgan , " he said , the smile still in place , " if I never get out of this bed I 'll still praise God because that would be His plan for me . " Morgan had sat thunderstruck , rescued only when Milly had offered him coffee . It tasted like bitter water in his mouth , but it gave him something to do with his hands and eyes . He drank every drop , and not long after he 'd finished the cup , he 'd taken his leave .  | On his walk home , he moved very slowly . He had n't thought about what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came to mind . He had listened to every word of Pastor Munroe 's sermons , just as she 'd urged him to do , but he still did n't like what he heard . Addy had told him not to harden his heart , and the words had been good . Morgan could see that hardening his heart was exactly what he was doing . He was doing it now . Walking away from Kevin Taggart , Morgan pushed all thoughts of God from his mind . He arrived home in a frightful mood , but no one in his family made comment . Jackie held in the huge sigh that threatened to escape her and walked up the steps of the schoolhouse for the start of the new year . It was difficult to have shared a room with Eddie for all those years because it caused her to think of herself as older , when in fact she had two more years of school to go . Eddie was the lucky one . Her birthday had fallen right before the school year began , so when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 until January , which meant that even though she turned 18 in the middle of the following year , she would still need to attend . It was almost more than the 16-year-old could take . At least the teacher was still Miss Bradley . Rumor in town had been that she was moving to Denver and would not be back , but she was there at the front of the room , looking much the same . Jackie had not enjoyed the punishment she 'd received late in the last school year , but she had to admit that the woman was fair . Her praise was as noteworthy as her discipline . Being in school also reminded her of Clayton and the loss of his dream . Jackie had cried buckets over this . Clayton had not . He had told her very calmly that this was the way it needed to be right now , and someday God would provide another way . Jackie had felt devastated for him nonetheless . She could n't understand her own heart . First she was crushed that he was leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't go . She 'd finally gone to her mother and been surprised speechless by what she said .  | " That 's what true love is all about , Jackie . We put aside our feelings and wants to see to another 's needs or happiness . " Jackie could not get the words out of her mind . True love . Is that what she felt for Clayton ? Is that why she was so tongue-tied and felt so foolish around him ? Her heart did the funniest things when he was near , and she was never hungry afterward . Was it love ? Jackie could see that she had much to think about . " I want you to be thinking about what you will write , " Miss Bradley 's voice cut across her thoughts . " And I will expect you to do your best . It can be any subject , but it must be thorough . The paper is due at the end of the month , September 30 , three-and-ahalf weeks from today . Yes , Padriac ? " " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I want you to do this on your own . Now , go get your math books and let 's begin on page 6 . " Jackie did sigh this time , but also reminded herself she had better start listening . She had a paper due on the last day of the month , and she was n't even sure what was expected . She opened her math book to page 6 and told herself to get in line . " A grizzly ? " The little girl 's eyes widened . Yep . " How big was it ? " Sammy asked . " Big , " Clayton told her and shook his head . " Ugly too , with a turned-up nose and a bunch of fur missing off his back . " " Maybe it was a she . " " Maybe , " Clayton agreed and tweaked the end of her nose . Jackie looked on . She wanted to be so light and carefree around Clayton , just like Sammy was , but she had decided that she was in love with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammy and Clayton talked on about the bear some more , and then Clayton moved away . They were at a birthday party for old Mrs. Greeley . She was a regular customer at the store , and the whole  | Fontaine family had been invited . Elaine , Clayton , and Milly were there because Milly had taken piano lessons from Mrs. Greeley . Jackie began to wander some herself . The party was being held in the elderly lady 's house and backyard , but Jackie moved to the front . She had decided to do her school report on wildflowers , and Mrs. Greeley 's fenced-in front yard was full of them . Jackie moved among the different blooms , touching one here and smelling one there . She wished she had paper along to take a few notes , but maybe she could come back and do that later . She was kneeling on the grass to look at an interesting species when she heard footsteps . Jackie looked up to see Paddy approaching , a grin on his face . " Now , do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday . " Jackie smiled in return ; he was always so fun . " Well , Mrs. Greeley does have some perfect blooms , and since I was here ... " The young woman shrugged . Paddy sank down onto the grass . " I 'll put mine off until the night before it 's due and then write like mad ' til I 'm done . " " Why , Paddy ? Why not work a little at a time ? " " Because I 've no interest in horses . " " Then why did you choose that subject ? " Paddy shrugged . " My mother has a book on horses , and it just seemed convenient . " Jackie shook her head . " You should have chosen something you 're interested in . " " My mother does n't have any books on mines . " Jackie 's mouth swung wide open . " Paddy ! You do n't need books . Your father 's a surveyor , and you could get him to take you to a mine . Who needs books when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he 'd just seen a ghost . " Jackie , darlin ' , you 're an angel . " He breathed the words and stood . He felt so good that he even bent low and dropped a kiss onto her cheek Jackie only laughed as he then shouted with glee and ran to find his father in the back . It would have been a wonderful scene if Jackie had n't  | looked up and spotted Clayton coming her way . Had he seen the kiss ? Would he think that she was interested in Paddy ? " What are you up to ? " Clayton was beside her now , dropping onto the grass much the way Paddy had done . " Oh , just looking at the wildflowers . " " Milly told me about your report . " " She did ? " " Sure . She said Miss Bradley looked quite impressed . Most of the class is doing an animal of some sort , and she thought the teacher must think wildflowers would be a nice change . " Jackie nodded but could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but utterly mute with Clayton ? " So tell me what all of these are . " Clayton indicated the flowers around them . " I 'm certain you must know them all , Clayton . " " Well , tell me anyhow . It 'll give you good practice . " " You 're such a pest , " she told him to cover her feelings , but she did as he asked . " This is Indian paintbrush , and this pink one is mountain hollyhock . Behind you is western coneflower and then blazing star . " " What about this one ? " Clayton pointed to a flower colored in deep pink with numerous yellow stamens in the center . It was lovely to the eyes and had a small , delicate , light green leaf . Jackie reached for it and smiled . " This is a wild rose . It 's my favorite . " She held it to her nose . " I love the fragrance . " She let Clayton smell it , and he smiled as well . With his eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Would you like to be alone with him ? " Jackie 's eyes flew to his . She blushed to a color that rivaled the Indian paintbrush . Clayton took that as a yes and rose . He smiled at Paddy on his way by but said nothing else to Jackie . She was glad that she 'd been a help to Paddy , and even that he 'd come back to tell her that his father was going to help , but more than anything , she wanted to call Clayton back and tell him he had it all wrong .  | Kevin 's chest heaved from the exertion , but the sense of triumph he always felt was well worth it . This was the fifth time he 'd sat in a chair , and the tingling he felt in his feet made him want to shout with joy . However , this was a solemn occasion . His wife knew what he was going to say , but Clayton and Milly had no idea . He took a deep breath and began . " Your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver . We 've all done a lot of praying and thinking , and I 've decided to take a job that she has offered me in the office at the mill . " Clayton and Milly stared at him and then at their mother . " You mean move to Denver ? " Milly whispered after a painful moment of silence . " Yes , " her father said gently . " Why , Dad ? " Clayton managed . " Why leave Georgetown ? You and Mom love it here . " " Yes , we do , Clay , but your mother and I want you to get to school , and we ca n't wait too long or the snows are going to be upon us . It 's the ninth of October , and I ca n't believe we 're not snowed in already . " " You ca n't do this , Dad ! " Clayton burst out , all calmness deserting him . " You love it here in the mountains , and I wo n't let you give it all up for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then said , " I talked to young Doc Edwardson just this morning . He told me I would never sit in the saddle again . If I thought there was a chance , I 'd stick it out , Clay , but I know in my heart he 's right . I never thought I 'd be happy behind a desk , but I 'm so thrilled to be sitting in a chair right now that I 'll take what I can get to support my family . And that is what I 'm talking about , Clay , " he added almost sternly . " It 's my job to take care of this family , and any way I can do that , I will . " The room fell very silent now . Milly could hear the pounding of blood in her ears . Leave Georgetown ? Leave Danny and Paddy ? What would she do ? She had no desire to live in Denver . Why , God , why did this happen to Dad ? Why must he suffer this way ? She  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she could n't hold back the tears . Elaine went to her . " It 's all right , Milly . I 've cried too , and I know I 'm going to cry again . " So it 's really all set ? " she sobbed . " We 're really going to go ? " " Yes , dear . We leave next week . " Milly cried against her mother 's shoulder , feeling like her heart would break . Clayton did n't feel any better himself , but his father was saying something and he tried to attend . " Clay , did you hear me ? " " No , I 'm sorry , Dad , I did n't . " " You can go to school , son . " Clay nodded , but there was no joy in it . " You do n't understand , " Kevin went on . " Your grandmother checked it out . You can start as soon as you arrive . Attendance was down this year , and they 'll take anyone they can get . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can start in January . " Clayton blinked at his father . That was good news , but not at the expense of this family . " You 're schooling is a factor , Clay , but it 's not the only reason . Can you see that ? " " I 'm trying , Dad , but it 's just not working . I think the main reason you 're doing this is because I went back to work . " " Exactly ! " Kevin said triumphantly . Clayton could only shake his head . " But you just said ? " " I just said the schooling is not the reason , but your supporting this family is . " Clayton only looked at him . " Clay , " Kevin said patiently . " If I had died , then I would expect you to stay here and take care of Milly and your mother , but I 'm not dead . I 'm not even an invalid . I can work . I ca n't do the work I 've always done , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to do . " He paused for a moment , a strange light coming into his eyes . " You know , Clay , I nearly forgot that your nineteenth birthday is three weeks away . You can do what you wish , but Milly ,  | your mother , and I are moving to Denver . If you want to join us , you 're more than welcome . " Clayton had to smile at this new tactic . He now understood . Kevin smiled in return . " What day do we go ? " " Next Friday , the sixteenth . " ' All right , " Clay told him . He looked to Milly . She was still visibly shaken but holding on . Kevin asked everyone to pray with him , and they all bowed their heads . " This is no mistake , " he told his heavenly Father . " We 're all going to hurt , Lord , but You are here with us , and we know this is all a part of Your plan . Thank You for Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we are tempted to fret . Surround us , especially Clay and Milly , with your grace . Make our peace greater than our pain , so that our lives may glorify You as never before . " God touched Clayton 's and Milly 's hearts in a special way during their father 's prayer . They knew that they would hurt , but the move was for the best . Milly was able to hug and kiss her parents good-night with a genuine smile on her face . Clayton , equally serene , went off to bed with plans running through his mind . They would have to work hard to be able to move in a week , but the snow would not allow them any more time . The temperatures were already dropping fast . Clayton was nearly asleep when he remembered Jackie . He would have to seek her out in the morning and tell her himself . Somehow he knew she would be hurt if she found out secondhand . He told himself he 'd take care of it right after breakfast in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep .  | Clayton was at the Fontaine home early the next day , but still he missed Jackie . Addy told him that she 'd gone very early with her father to the store . He briefly explained why he needed to see her and was surprised when Addy ordered Danny to go with Clayton and take Jackie 's place at the store . " It wo n't take that long to tell her , Mrs. Fontaine , " Clayton said when Danny went for her coat . Addy stared at him . Why were men so stupid at times ? " Well , " she said , " I think she might be sad , and Danny could help out until she feels like working . " Clayton shrugged and waited for Danny to come . He was completely unaware of the way Addy scribbled a quick note for Danny to put in her pocket and give to her father . She saw both Danny and Clayton out the front door and then bundled into her coat . The other girls would be leaving for the store in about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Elaine . " Hello , " Clayton greeted Jackie as soon as he found her upstairs in the kitchen . The cleaning of Uncle Mitch 's apartments had been put off way too long , and now Morgan wanted it done . He 'd taken Jackie with him early to see to it . " Well , now . " Jackie smiled at the sight of him . His face was red from the cold , and he was so handsome in his heavy leather coat  | that her heart ached . " You 're certainly out early today to pester people . " Clayton smiled in return and did some admiring of his own . Jackie 's face was flushed and just a little dusty , and he thought she looked like an adorable street urchin . " Yes , I am . I 've come to tell you something . " " Good news ? " " Yes . " " What is it ? " " I 'm going to Denver . " " Denver ? " Her face held a puzzled expression for several seconds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to school ! That 's wonderful ! " Jackie nearly hugged him but caught herself in time . She felt flustered by her own thoughts and shuffled the dust rag in her grasp from one hand to the other . " Your dream , Clayton , " she finally managed . " You get to realize your dream . " Clayton nodded . It was still not real to him , but he was very pleased at her genuine response . " When do you go ? " she asked suddenly . " Next week . " Some of Jackie 's elation left her . Next week . But of course , she realized , it would have to be soon , or the snow would hold him up . She opened her mouth to ask something else , but Clayton con-tinued . " There 's more , Jackie . My father 's been offered a job in Denver , so we 're all going . " This time she took a moment to respond . " You 're all going ? " Jackie 's voice was uncertain . Clayton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be caught out . " Yes . My grandmother still owns and operates a mill in Denver , and Dad will be taking an office job . It 'll be hard to leave George-town  --  he loves it here  --  but we all feel a peace about this . "  | " Sure , " Jackie said and wondered how normal her voice sounded . " I 'm glad he 's doing so much better . I 'm sorry I have n't been able to come as often , but it 's hard with school . " " Oh , Jackie , do n't apologize , " Clayton swiftly told her , his voice sincere . " You 've done more than enough , and we 'll always be grate-ful . " Jackie nodded . " Well , if there 's anything else I can do , let me know . " " Thank you , Jackie . I 'll let you get back to work now . " " Sure , Clay . I 'll see you later . " He was gone in the next instant , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't needed to rush and tell her ; after all , she took it very well . But he was glad he had . He suddenly shook his head . What had he expected ? Screaming hysterics ? It 's not as if they were engaged to be married and the separation would upset their whole world . Clayton was amused by his own worry and then realized he had to get home . There was plenty to do . He stopped for a moment to tell Morgan and Danny of their plans and then went swiftly on his way . ' When he left , Danny turned to her father with tears in her eyes . Morgan looked at her with compassion . He 'd asked his daughters many times to move from their friends , but never had Danny had a friend move from her . Addy was going to be equally upset about Elaine . " Oh , no ! " Danny suddenly exclaimed . " He 's already told Jackie . " " Is that bad ? " " Oh , Father , " Danny 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Morgan 's mouth opened in surprise , and then he asked himself why no one ever told him anything . " You 'd better go and check on her , Dan . Tell her that if she wants to go home , she can . " Danny went without another word and was surprised to find Jackie working . Her back was to the door as she knelt on the kitchen floor , scrubbing it with all her might .  | " Jackie ? " Danny called and came forward , but the arm motion did n't stop . Danny moved so she could see her sister 's face . " Please stop , Jackie , and talk to me . " Jackie sat back on her heels and stared straight ahead . " What did you want to talk about ? " " Well , Father said that if you 'd rather go home , you could do that . " Jackie shook her head , her eyes on the counter she had just scrubbed . " I think I 'd rather work . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older girl shook her head . " He does n't have any idea , Danny . In fact , he 's very excited about leaving . He gets to go to school now , and he 's naturally pleased about that . " Jackie finally looked at Danny . " I 'm sorry that Milly 's leaving . I know you 'll miss her . Mother will miss Mrs. Taggart too . " " But what about you , Jackie ? " Danny persisted . The older girl shrugged . " I did n't think I would survive when Eddie left , but I did . I 'll survive again . " She went back to the floor . Danny wanted to burst into tears . She had never seen her sister give up so quickly . I have to believe that she 'll be all right , Danny said to herself as she returned downstairs . She believes that she will be , and I must believe it too . But it was not to be . The news had come on Saturday , and by Wednesday Jackie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was coming down with something . She and Danny had needed to keep busy , and so they worked at the store every day , but both were depressed . Jackie almost invariably waited on Clayton when he came into the store , but on this occasion she was busy with two other customers . In fact , she did n't even see him . Danny went to the other side of the counter to see to his needs , but for a moment she could see only his profile as he stared at Jackie . Danny waited patiently until he turned . " Did you need something , Tag ? " " Danny . " His face and voice were serious . " Is Jackie ill ? "  | Danny frowned , and anger , anger she suddenly realized had been simmering in her since Saturday , came to the surface . She did nothing to hide this emotion . " How thick can one man be , Clayton ? " Clayton was so surprised that he blinked . " Have I done something , Danny ? " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so did her heart . " Oh , Clayton , " she sighed . " You know better than anyone how hard it is for her to make friends . First Eddie goes and now you . How do you think she should be feeling ? " Tears had come to Danny 's eyes , and she dashed them away with an embarrassed move . " But I thought she and Paddy ? " Danny 's mouth came open , and Clayton let the sentence hang . " Paddy O'Brien ? " Danny 's voice came out in an incredulous squeak . " Well , yes . I thought maybe they were ? " The look of shock in Danny 's eyes brought him to an uncomfortable halt . Danny felt as if the wind had been knocked out of her . She looked down at her hands and then back at her customer , her voice suddenly tired . " What can I get for you , Clayton ? " " Lexa , dear , " old Mrs. Greeley suddenly spoke in a loud voice from Clayton 's side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Clayton urged her in a low voice . " I 'll look around . " " Lexa , can you help me ? " " Yes , Mrs. Greeley , and I 'm Danny . " " Oh , thank you , dear . " She was deaf as a post . " Now , Lexa , I need some thread . Blue . Not too dark and not too light . " Danny sighed but then thought it might be for the best . Maybe Jackie could help Clayton , and he would say something kind to her . But it did n't work out that way . Danny glanced up at one point to see her father attending to him . Clayton 's gaze was still on Jackie , but she did n't notice . Mrs. Greeley was shouting again in order to hear her own voice , and when Danny looked one last time , Clayton was gone .  | Addy watched Jackie pick at her food that evening and begged ( iod for wisdom . Mother and daughter had prayed together every night over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mourning . In a way she was . Addy was much the same way when she was upset . She lost all interest in food or coffee . Addy was old enough to know she had to eat , but right now , Jackie simply did n't care . Addy worried she would come down sick before she felt up to eating again . She had tried to discuss it with Morgan , but his answer had been to order Jackie to eat and to punish her if she did n't . Addy wished she 'd kept the concern to herself . It was a surprise to everyone when Clayton came to the house that night . They were all aware of how hard the Taggarts were working to get ready to go , but Morgan had a rare moment of insight when he let Clayton in the front door . " I 'd like to talk to Jackie , " Clay told him . Is she around ? " " Sure , Clay . Go right into the living room . I 'll send her in . " Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Clay is here to see you , Jack . He 's in the living room . " " Oh , " was the only reply he received , and for a moment he wondered if Danny had known what she was talking about . Sammy began to slip past him to see Clayton as well , but he caught the back of her dress . " Not tonight , Sam . Let Jack go on her own . " Morgan was rewarded by Addy 's loving smile of approval . That smile did things to his heart . Danny had known what she was talking about . Morgan decided then and there to ask Addy about it when they were alone ; after that he would kiss her until they were both breathless . " Hello , Clay , " Jackie spoke as she came into the room . Clayton came to his feet . " Hi , Jackie . I hope I did n't take you from anything . " He tried not to look at how thin she had become , but it was impossible ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . " Jackie smiled , her voice sounding normal . " Just the dishes , and I wo n't miss those . " She sat on one of the chairs , and he sat across from her . To Jackie 's surprise , an uncomfortable silence fell . If she had n't known better , she would have said Clayton was nervous . ' Are you all packed ? " Jackie rescued him . ' Almost . Tomorrow should be a pretty easy day , but then we have lots of goodbyes to make . " " I 'll bet you do . Be sure and tell us all goodbye tonight , and then you can scratch us off the list . " Clayton stared at her . Why had he never noticed how few demands she made on him ? It was n't that way at first . At first she had had all sorts of expectations , and he had n't caught half of them , but in the past year she never made him feel bad about leaving or pressured him to do anything for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was far less demanding than Milly , who was a wonderful sister in her own right . " I 'll write to you , " he suddenly said , and watched a grimace of pain cross her face . " Oh , Clay , do n't say that , " she said softly . " Why not ? It 's true . " Jackie shook her head . " It never quite works that way . " " I do n't know what you mean . " She sighed softly . Jackie usually had a hard time sharing her feelings for fear of rejection , but Clayton was leaving and suddenly she did n't care what he thought . She was going to be honest even if it hurt him a little . " It 's nothing intentional , Clay , but when a person goes away he sets up a new life for himself . Eddie has n't written anywhere near what she 'd promised , but I understand . She has her life there in Boulder , and she 's busy with that . I 'm sure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . " " I 'm going to write to you , " he stated emphatically , but Jackie did n't comment . Clayton let the silence hang between them for a moment . She was n't even looking at him . How had he been so blind to her feelings and need for friendship ?  | " Jackie . " He waited until she looked up and then asked plainly , ill you write back to me if I write to you ? " Jackie let herself really look at him now , telling herself it might the last time . She knew her heart would always melt at the sight f him , but she had to say what was on her mind . " I honestly do n't think you will , Clay , at least not over once or ice , but I 'll answer every letter you send me . " Clay nodded . " It 's a deal then . " Jackie actually managed a smile , but her heart knew the truth . Clayton did n't say his goodbyes that night but came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were tears on nearly everyone 's part , but Jackie was dry-eyed . Why this stuck out to Clayton more than anything else , he did n't know . But even when the stage pulled out of Georgetown the next day , his father made as comfortable as possible for the long trip , the look in Jackie 's eyes still haunted him . 183  | The mails were in their usual winter holdup , but surprisin enough , Jackie received three letters on the same day . One was fro Eddie and two were from Clayton , who had been gone a mont She told herself not to get her hopes up . He was writing only cause he said he would , but it would be no different than Eddi The snow did slow things up , but this was Eddie 's first letter t her in weeks . Jackie opted to open the letter from her sister first . She was very cheered by the words inside , but felt sad when Eddie once again confided to Jackie that she wished to be pregnant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she wrote , " but you never dream it will happen to you . I know Robert loves me as I am , and even laughs and hugs me if I mention my infertile state , but I so want us to have a child . I 've never wrestled with anything as much as this . I have even been angry at God . Please pray for me concerning my heart 's attitude . " Jackie did pray for her , every night . She also prayed that someday they would see each other again , but it did n't seem likely to happen anytime soon . Jackie 's mind swam in all directions for a while before she told herself to get on with what she was doing . She picked up Clayton 's letters , opened both of them just enough to see which one he 'd written first , and then started in . She was in for a pleasant surprise . " I thought we were going to be on that stage forever . But , " he had underlined that word , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 've never moved so fast in my life . Poor Miner Id have dropped dead from heart failure . " Jackie laughed in delight at this description and thought of Miner , now housed in stable behind the store . She avidly read on . My grandmother 's house is nothing like I expected . She has enough room to house the whole of Denver . I think I mentioned to you that I would stay with her only if it worked out . Well , believe me , Jackie , it has been fine . She 's so loving and really delighted to have us here . I have n't actually walked to the school , so I do n't know exactly how far away the school is right now , but I 'm going tomorrow . I 'm a little nervous about checking in at the school , but Grandma says there 's nothing to worry about . My father starts work tomorrow too . My mother tried to get him to take it easy for a time , but he 's raring to go . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well because of it , but my mom says I 'll adjust . Milly has cried every day for Danny and Paddy , but the sights and sounds of the big city have certainly helped to distract her . Jackie had to stop reading . She was so amazed she could n't go on . Why , it sounded just like him ! At times it was difficult to picture Eddie and Robert , but Clayton 's letters were just an extension of the man , and Jackie could see his face and hear his voice as she read . Relieved by this revelation , Jackie gave way to her exhaustion . She lay back on her bed and let the wonderfulness of it flow over her . However , she sobered swiftly . It did n't mean he would keep writing . She finished the first letter and turned to the next one . It was just as much fun as the first and ended with a postscript . " Do n't forget , Miss Fontaine , you said you would reply to every letter . You now owe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetting all about being cautious . She pulled out paper and immediately started to write . The things she could never say to Clayton 's face now came easily . She swiftly told him that she missed him and all of his family and then went on to talk about events in Georgetown . She was careful to address only the things in the first letter with plans to answer the other one as well . She started the second one by saying , " If you have n't received my first letter , do n't read this or it will be all out of whack . " She then put a little smiling face on the page and smiled herself . The second letter went on for three pages . Jackie would have written more , but her father stuck his head in the door and told her to get to bed . Addy came soon after to kiss her . Jackie scrambled up into the big bed , feeling five years old all over again . " That 's certainly a happy face , " Addy commented , kissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to me . " " Danny told me . " " Two letters , Mother , and they sound just like Clay . " Addy sat down now and just listened to the sound of her voice . Addy did n't know what she would do if Clayton did n't follow through . It would almost be easier never to hear from him again if he was n't going to remain her friend , but that decision was out of her hands . Then Addy asked herself what she expected the man to do if he met a girl in Denver and fell in love . Right now she could n't find an answer . A moment later she kissed Jackie and told her good-night . She went to her own room , giving Jackie and Clayton over to God in prayer and taking them back again in worry not two minutes later . Go to sleep , Addy , she finally said to herself . You can pray about this in the morning .  | Jackie 's letter began with " Merry Christmas . " Clayton smiled t the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume my letters are taking as long to get to you as yours are to me , so I 'm getting a jump on the stage . Who knows ? I may even 17 before you get this . I do n't suppose a man of your advanced rs ( 20 , is n't it now ? ) can possibly remember these young , care-e days , but I 'll try to fill you in . " Jackie went on to tell him about an afternoon at school , followed by an evening of work at the store . He laughed until tears ran down his face . Everything that could go wrong , had , and then some . She asked him all about school and whether or not he 'd had his first exam . She said she hoped he was making friends and was n't lonely . Clayton finished her letter and then sat staring into space . Had she really been so shy , or was another girl writing these letters ? This was the fourth he 'd received , and he could n't believe what fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work that going to church and reading her letters were the only bright spots in his week . As had become the pattern , Clayton got ready to write back to her . He knew somehow that he would never hear from her unless he wrote first , and for some reason the idea of not getting a letter from her utterly depressed him . Christmas was still more than two weeks away , but if he mailed the letter tomorrow , he was certain that she would receive it in plenty of time . In the sawmill where his father worked they had a machine that allowed them to call one another within the building . It was the most wondrous thing he had ever seen . His father could pick up the instrument at his desk and a bell would ring down in the warehouse . Someone could pick-up down there and talk to him . It would be wonderful to talk to Jackie through that instrument . It would have done his heart good to hear her laugh . Clayton was about to put ink to paper when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A knock sounded a moment later . ' Come on in , " Clayton called , turning from his desk to see his father come through the door . " I saw your light . Studying late ? "  | " No , I 'm just getting ready to write to Jackie . " " How is she ? " Clayton smiled . " Doing well , I think . A little tired of the snow but looking forward to Christmas . " " Your mother said that Eddie was in touch yesterday . " " Yes , she was . She and Robert are busy in a small church , and God is doing mighty things . She admitted she 's so busy in Boulder that she feels likes she 's losing touch with Georgetown and her family . " Kevin nodded . " Is that why you write Jackie regularly ? Because you feel sorry for her ? " " It was at first , " Clayton admitted , remembering how he 'd told her he would . " But now I look forward to hearing from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " " What do you mean ? " Clayton shrugged . " I do n't know exactly , but I 'd see her laughing with a group and then I 'd come on the scene . She would act as though she was pleased to see me , but she would n't have two words to say . Her face would get red for no reason . " Kevin stared at his son . Could he really be so unsuspecting ? Kevin thought about the way Jackie looked when she came up to his bedroom to say goodbye . She had not been upstairs one time before that day , but Elaine had told him of the way she 'd come in and quietly helped around the house . They had never had much contact , and Kevin had still been thinking of her the way she was that first summer when she despised Clayton . He had struggled with his feelings toward her for that very reason , but the young woman who 'd come to his room to tell him she was praying and to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an odd look on your face , " Clayton commented . " Do I ? " " Yes . Are you going to tell me what it means ? " Kevin looked at him and made a decision . " You ca n't force feelings that are not there , Clay , but I want you to think long and hard about the way you just described Jackie to me . " Clayton 's brow furrowed . Why would he ask him to do that ?  | " Just think about it , Clay . I 'm glad you have tremendous respect for women , and that you have chosen to comport yourself in a way that pleases God , but you 're being naive where Jackie is con-cerned . " Understanding came to Clayton like a bee sting . He literally started in his seat and stared , slack-jawed , at his father . He started to shake his head , but Kevin only smiled . " I hope I have n't ruined things between the two of you , Clay , but I felt it was only fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't believe it , " he admitted softly . " I mean , it 's not the way I would think anyone would act . " Kevin tilted his head to one side , his smile still in place . " I ca n't agree with you , Clay . I think that 's exactly the way she would act . After all , you 've never done anything to encourage her , so she could n't exactly let her feelings show . " Clayton 's hand came to his mouth and then rubbed over his jaw . He was still trying to take it in , but his father said a soft " goodnight " and went out . Oh , Jackie , how could I have missed that . I felt such a peace about not being in love with you that it never occurred to me that you might not share that feeling . The thinness of her wrists and the way her cheeks sank in just before he left Georgetown jumped starkly into Clayton 's mind . The young man 's eyes slid shut . Jackie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her like that . He had been on the verge of picking up the pen to write to her about school , but now he only shook his head . " Every letter is all about me , " he told the quiet room . " Every letter is filled with Clayton 's world . " This was not exactly true , but Clayton was upset . " You are an incredibly selfish person , Clayton Taggart , and it 's nothing short of self-centeredness that it has taken this long for you to see it . " Clayton did write Jackie a letter that night , but it was one with her in mind . He answered the questions she 'd asked of him , but then sent back dozens of his own . He suddenly wanted to know so much . His heart ached that he 'd been so insensitive . He had n't suddenly fallen in love with her because of his father 's words , but  | he saw now that he could have been so much kinder and more c ing of her needs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be encouraged . He was already in class before he reali that he had n't remembered to say anything about her birthday . " Happy birthday , " Morgan said . Jackie 's eyes widened . H birthday had been over a week ago , but her father was holding gift for her . " This came to the store . " " Oh ! " Her eyes sparkled with pleasure . " Is it from Eddie ? " " Not unless she 's moved to Denver . " Jackie became very still . " Denver ? " " That 's right , " he said with a flourish , and set the box on the table beside her plate . Her sisters were all watching her . " Are n't you going to open it ? " Lexa wanted to know . " Yes , but I do n't want to hold up dinner . " " Well , " her mother said practically , " let 's pray and get started , and you can open it when you want to . " Jackie nodded and all heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Jackie did n't hear a word . Her eyes were on the box . She put food on her plate without really seeing it . Morgan and Addy shared a smile when she took a huge helping of beets . Jackie hated beets . " I want you to open it now , Jackie , " Danny admitted suddenly . " The rest of us do n't have birthdays for weeks to come and any gift , even someone else 's , is fun . " Jackie looked at her and chuckled . " You might as well , Jackie , " her father put it . " You 're sure not interested in eating . " She blushed a little at that and , using her knife , opened the box . There were all sorts of wrappings inside , and it took some work , but when the floor was finally littered with paper Jackie brought forth the most delicate crystal bell she 'd ever seen .  | " Ohhh . " Her sisters gave a collective sigh as she held it up for ction . " Ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did , the room with a delightful tinkling sound . " I have to go and write to him right now , " Jackie said in a my voice . She began to move , but Morgan waved her back . " After you eat , " he told her in a voice that she knew better n to argue with . Nodding , Jackie set the bell carefully by her plate and just ked at it . It was several more minutes before she picked up her fork . ' All right , " she said to the sisters on either side of her . " Who 's e joker ? Who put all the beets on my plate ? " The whole family laughed at her expense .  | Jackie had thought that winter would last forever , but the mud , sucking at her boots , gave lie to that myth . Spring was upon them , and the snow was melting fast and furiously . Flowers were already working their way out of the ground , and Jackie had only to close her eyes to envision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment could have used some of that same loveliness . The soggy ground was getting to her . She looked down at her skirt to see that she had spattered mud up the front of herself . She was going to have to go to work like this , and the thought made her want to explode with anger . She heard a wagon slogging its way along , but she did n't even look up . In her irritation she missed a step and fell down . By the time the wagon drew abreast of her , she was struggling up from her hands and knees and was literally black with mud . She had just gained her footing when she realized the wagon had stopped . Jackie looked up , straight into the eyes of her sister . " Eddie , " she whispered and then screamed , " Eddie ! " Eddie laughed and Robert joined her . Jackie nearly did a dance in her exasperation . " You did n't tell anyone , and look at me  --  I ca n't even touch you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you home , " Eddie told her , a huge smile still in place . " We 're going to surprise Mother . "  | " All right , " Jackie agreed , " but just let me clean up quickly so can see her face . Take the wagon around the back , " she inructed Robert . " I 'll let you in that way and she 'll feint . " Eddie turned on the seat to talk to her filthy s ister as Jackie climbed in . She turned a beaming face to her . " You look wonderful , Eddie . " " You do too . I think . " They both laughed hilariously at this until Robert reminded them they were going to alert Addy if they did n't quiet down . They tried to be calm , but it was like being 10 and 12 all over again and both just wanted to giggle for the fun of it . " How have you been ? " Eddie asked in a soft vo ice . Jackie gave her a mock frown . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote more often . " Eddie looked very contrite , but her eyes were still shining . " Do n't be too long , " Eddie admonished Jackie when the team halted around back . " I wo n't , " Jackie promised , climbing down in an undignified fashion . Robert had left the wagon as well , and leaning from his great height , dropped a kiss on her forehead . He managed to do this and not get anywhere near that mud . Jackie smiled up at him with loving eyes and darted into the back door . " It 's just me , Mother , " she called from the kitchen . " What 's wrong ? " Addy was dusting the front room and remained there . " I fell in the mud . I 'm going to change and head back out . " " All right . Be certain to leave your things in the kitchen . " Normally Jackie would have undressed without a thought , but with Robert in the backyard , she was careful to stay away from the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then dashed up the stairs for fresh clothing . She dressed in record time , and when she got back down , Robert and Eddie were waiting right outside the kitchen door . She let them in silently , hugged them both , and then strolled nonchalantly to the living room to see her mother .  | " All clean now , dear ? " Addy only glanced at her . " Yes , Mother . I 'll get going pretty soon , but I wanted to you something . " " That 's fine with me , dear , but your father will be looking you . " Addy 's cloth attacked a small vase . " Well , I 'll hurry . Mother , do you think I could make my room in the small room off the kitchen ? " " Whatever for ? " Addy 's face was still bent over her work . " Well , I think it would be a nice change . " " I do n't think so , Jackie . " She set the vase down and positio it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean it 's so much sm than your room , and I really do n't think you 'll be as comfortabl " Well , could n't I just try it for a week ? " " I do n't know , dear . " Addy shook her head , still not looking Jackie as she reached for a tiny china doll . " I do n't really see t point . " " But if she ca n't take that room , Mother , " Eddie now stepp into the room , " where will Robert and I sleep for the next wee " Eddie . " Her mother breathed the word as she spun aroun The doll and dust cloth landed on a chair as Addy swiftly navigat through furniture to get to her daughter . Eddie met her halfwa across the room . By the time they touched , the tears were flowin unchecked . More than a year . Her precious Eddie had been Mrs. Robert Langley for more than a year . It was like a wonderful present from the Lord to be able to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , moving to hug her son-in-law . She then held him at arm 's length and looked him over . " You look wonderful , Robert . Married life must agree with you . " " Indeed , it does . If the girl is anything like my Eddie , I highly recommend it . " Husband and wife shared a smile , and Addy urged them into chairs . " Have you been to the store ? Have you seen Morgan ? " " Yes , " Eddie answered . " He gave us the wagon and said he hoped Jackie would still be home . "  | Robert grinned . " She was the welcome party out on the road . " Oh , no . " Addy was swift to catch on . " You fell in the mud in front of them . " Jackie shrugged , but she was not upset . Suddenly the mud did n't matter at all . Only last week she 'd written Clayton and admitted that she was almost angry that Robert and Eddie had never come to visit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not trusting God for this . " We saw Danny and Lexa with Father , but where 's Sammy ? " Eddie wished to know . " She 's in bed . She 's had a touch of something for a week now , and all she wants to do is sleep . I should go and see if she wants to get up . " Addy went out , and Jackie looked over to see Robert smiling at her . " We got a letter from Tag last week . " " Did you ? " Jackie smiled and tried not to blush at the sound of his name . " Yes . He says that you correspond quite regularly . " Jackie did blush then , but only nodded in return . If the truth be told , they wrote to each other at least twice a week . It was still amazing to Jackie that they never ran out of things to say . And Clayton 's letters had just gotten kinder and kinder with every passing month . He always admonished Jackie to take good care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overdo on his studies , and that he would n't be fit to teach if he burned out during college . His plan right now was to take some summer courses as well , but Jackie wondered if he was n't going overboard . He wanted to finish in two years , and he said this was the only way . " I think we 've lost her . " Eddie 's voice floated through the air . " Yes , " Robert agreed . " I think we lost her the moment I mentioned Clay 's name . " Again Jackie lit up like a candle , and Eddie apologized . " Forgive us , Jackie ; we should n't tease . " " It 's all right . I 've always blushed easily when it comes to Clay . " " Does he know how you feel ? " Robert asked the question so gently that Jackie was n't offended .  | " No , he does n't , but that 's all right . It 's just fun to share lett with him . " Robert 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fell in to with Eddie . " " Oh , Robert , do n't say that , " Jackie begged him . " It hurts much to raise my hopes . " Robert looked at her . " Why ca n't you hope for it ? " Jackie shrugged . " I just do n't think it 's going to be like that , a that 's okay . I can live with it . " My , but she 's done a lot ofgrowing up , both Eddie and Robe were thinking . Nothing could ever dim her physical beauty , but she was now starting to be beautiful on the inside as well . Robert did n't comment again , but he did n't think the idea o the two of them getting together was so hopeless . Tag had n't actually come right out with it , but Robert had gained an impression from his letter that Jackie was pretty special . " Hi , Eddie . " " Oh , Sammy . " Eddie stood as soon as she saw her , her heart breaking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair was all over her head . Eddie went right to her . She hugged her , but Sammy needed to sit down . Eddie took the sofa so they could be close . Once Sammy was snuggled against her side , the little girl looked across the room at Robert . " Hello , Sammy . " " Hi , Robert . " " I 'm not sure you should be out of bed , " he said gently . " I had to , " she answered in a tired voice . " Why is that ? " " I have to ask you a question . How is Travis Buchanan ? " Robert smiled hugely . " Doing well . As handsome as ever , I would say . " Sammy smiled and sighed and then laid her head against Eddie . Not a minute later , she was asleep . Everyone in the room was forced to hold in their laughter .  | " Still not expecting ? " Addy questioned Eddie gently when they re alone . " No , " Eddy sighed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be In God 's time , but I do wish for it . " " There 's nothing wrong with that , " Addy replied . " Even the Bible talks about the way children are a woman 's pride and joy . I do n't think we 're in any way imperfect if we ca n't have children , but if we can , we should . " Eddie nodded . " I knew you would feel that way . " Both women were in Addy and Morgan 's bedroom , and silence fcll until Addy asked , " How does Robert feel about it , Eddie ? " " Oh , Mother , he 's so wonderful . He keeps reminding me how long he waited to find me . He says that if we never have children , he 'll still live the rest of his life in contentment with me at his side . " Addy smiled . " He 's very special . " " Yes . I only hope that all my sisters find men with half the love and tenderness Robert possesses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has claimed Travis Buchanan , but only when Danny 's not looking . " They laughed , but then Eddie turned serious , her mind going to her sister . " She 's still head-over-heels , is n't she , Mother ? " Addy sighed . " Yes . I think I wrote to you about the way she looked when Clayton left last year . " Eddie nodded . " She scared me to death , Eddie . She simply could n't eat , and I did n't think she would ever get over it . " " What happened ? " " He wrote her a letter . In fact , he wrote two letters . She had made a deal with him that if he wrote , she would reply . So she wrote back , and lo and behold , letters from him just kept coming . " She 's been so excited at times that she 's read a few to me . I do n't know if this will go anywhere , Eddie , but he has far more care for her feelings than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't get that close to her ; I mean , Jackie was impossible , but now , " Addy shrugged , " she 's utterly smitten . " " I can see it in her face when his name is mentioned . " Someone knocked at the door , and a moment later Robert stuck his head in . " I wondered where you 'd wandered off to . " " Why , Robert . " Eddie was surprised . " I thought you were having lunch with Father . " " I was , but he cut it short when I told him in no uncertain terms that we 're not moving to Georgetown and setting up a branch office to my bank . " The women could only stare at him . Eddie looked crushed , but her mother looked furious . Robert did n't know what else to say and was a little sorry he 'd interrupted them , so he quietly left . " After all this time , Mother , he still does n't accept this change . " " I know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but this time he must have just been lying in wait . " The image so amused Eddie that she suddenly smiled . He was like that at times ; he would rehearse his words and spring on someone , sure of what that person 's answer was going to be . Right now it seemed quite laughable to her . Addy suddenly looked over and saw Eddie 's smile . " It 's not funny , Eddie . " The older woman was still frowning . " I 'm sorry , Mother , but it is . Father is just too outrageous for words . Not a word out of him when we arrive . He greets us like everything is fine and then he pounces on Robert as soon as our backs are turned . " A giggle escaped her . " We might as well laugh as cry . Addy shook her head . She was not angry , but neither was she amused . Oh , Morgan , her heart sighed . What am I going to do with you ?  | Robert and Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a wonderful time , full of memories and fun . Some of the mud had dried up and although the temperatures were cool at night , the family had picnicked in the orchard on two occasions and gone for long afternoon walks . In the evenings they would pop corn and have hot cocoa and then visit until late at night . Even the younger girls had been given grace concerning the normal bedtime hour . Nothing else was said about Morgan 's proposal to Robert ? not even Addy mentioned it  --  but it caused some strain for several days . Addy , Robert , and Eddie were all privy to the details and prayed fervently . By the end of the visit all was well . It was impossible to say when they would see the young married couple again , so everyone was extremely thankful for this good time to-gether . The day they left , Jackie and Morgan saw them off and then went to the store . Jackie was feeling positively ecstatic about their visit and hummed as she worked , but Morgan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , was rather short with her and even abrupt with one or two customers . Jackie noticed it but did n't have a chance to say anything until near noon . " Would you like me to run over to the hotel and get us some dinner , Father ? " " No , " he said shortly . " I 'm not hungry "  | Jackie stood silently by the desk . All morning he 'd spent as mu time in the office as possible . " Maybe next time we 'll get to visit them , " she said softly . Mo gan looked at her sharply . Not easily intimidated , Jackie stood fa ing him . " What does that mean ? " he snapped . " Well , I know you miss them , " she said kindly , " and I just thought it would cheer you to think about going to see them in Boulder . I know I would enjoy it . " " Is that so ? Well , I for one have no interest in going to see where your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not involve anyone but herself . " This was completely unfair , but Morgan only went angrily back to his work . Jackie had always known that her father was self-centered , especially compared to her very giving mother , but never was it so clear as right now . She knew her mother 's father had never approved of the relationship between her father and her mother , but that had n't stopped Morgan from taking her away and marrying her . He had other ideas now that it was his daughter . Not to mention the fact that he had given his blessing . It occurred to Jackie suddenly that her father did not like things he could not control and that she tended to be the same way . Jackie could freely admit that she wished Eddie lived closer or wrote more often , but she could see that her sister was happy and blessed , and she would n't have wished anything else for her . And if their home was as large as it sounded , she had plenty to do . Eddie had also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Her life sounded very fruitful and peaceful . How could their father want any less for his oldest daughter ? " Well , " she said softly when Morgan continued to write , " I 'm going across the street to get something to eat . " Morgan 's head came up as she left , his brow drawn forward as he watched her leave . He knew he 'd been unreasonably harsh , but he did n't feel like apologizing . Besides , why could n't Robert set up here ? Morgan knew just where and how it could happen . There was  | empty store adjacent to his , and Georgetown needed another an k . " Young and headstrong , " Morgan muttered to himself . " I know what 's best for him and Ed if he would only listen . " Once again the angry man went back to his accounts . " The first of July ? " Addy commented after lunch that afternoon . " It 's hard to believe the month of June is already gone . " Lexa was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an outing with Paddy . " I 'll be back in school before I can count to ten , " Jackie complained . Addy smiled understandingly but then turned to look at her daughter . " What is it that you want to do so badly , Jackie , that you want to be finished with school ? " Jackie 's hair swung to one side as she tipped her head in thought . " I do n't know exactly . I like working at the store , but I guess I 'd like to travel a bit . " How this dream would be financed was not mentioned , but Addy said , " Any place in particular ? " " Boulder , " she said without hesitation . " I 'd love to see Boulder and Eddie . " " Would Denver enter into the picture in any of those travel plans ? " The question was kindly put . Jackie hugged the dish she 'd just dried against her chest and shook her head . " I do n't think so , Mother . He 's never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go if I was n't welcomed by Clayton himself . " Addy agreed softly but turned away before Jackie could see her face . Jackie 's eyes were so wistful any time his name was mentioned that it almost broke her mother 's heart to watch . The kitchen was in good shape now , so she left her daughter to go work on the rooms upstairs . Jackie finished drying the dishes  | on her own and started some baking . It was dreadfully hot , b they were out of bread and Father 's favorite cookies . She had just put the bread dough together when she saw him . She had no idea how long he 'd been standing there , but Clayton Taggart was in the doorway watching her . Jackie moved like a woman sleepwalking . She came around the table and stopped just two steps away from him . All the love she felt inside was written on her face before she could come to her senses . Clayton watched her blush and said gently , " Hello , Jackie . " Eight months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ! Jackie smiled suddenly . " I ca n't believe you 're here , " she admitted and looked away from him , feeling rather flustered . How many times had she practiced what she would do and say if she ever saw him again . Now all of it flew from her head . " Please , " she nearly stammered . " Sit down . You must be tired . " " Thank you , " Clayton said , taking a seat at the table . He could n't stop looking at her . She was so different from the last time he 'd seen her , and that Jackie was the only one he 'd been able to visualize . " Are you ... um . . . I mean , " she stumbled painfully , " would you care for some lemonade ? I just made some . " " Sure , that sounds great . " Jackie nearly dropped her mother 's good set of hollowware as she moved to the table , but she did finally manage to pour two lemonades . She started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pulled the chair out on the end and she sat beside him . It was her father 's chair . Clayton was in the side chair where her mother always sat . " How is your family ? " Jackie blurted , and Clayton told her things she already knew . " Oh , right . I guess you told me all about that in your last let-ter , " she said with an embarrassed smile . After that she rattled on , making no sense at all until Clayton came to the rescue . He gently laid a hand over hers . " Jackie , " he spoke tenderly . " It 's me , Clayton . "  | Jackie became utterly still . His touch was doing odd things to her heart . She told herself not to cry , and even managed to obey ; however , she could no longer keep her thoughts to herself . " Oh , Clay , I 've missed you so much . " His hand came up then . He tenderly stroked her cheek with the backs of his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be so witty and charming when you came , and now I 've been an idiot . " " I do n't think you 're an idiot . " His hand was on hers again . " How long can you stay , Clay ? " " I 'm not certain , " he admitted , keeping himself from adding , It all depends on you . " Where are you staying ? " Clayton smiled . " I do n't know . I was rather hoping your father would let me crash at Uncle Mitch 's . " " It 's rented , " Jackie told him . " Maybe I can ask Mother ? " she stopped suddenly . " How did you get in here ? " " Your mother let me in . " " But I never heard the door . " " You were too busy making something in the bowl over there . " " Oh ! " Jackie 's hands flew in the air , and she dashed back to her bread dough . " I 've got to punch this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would that be so bad ? " He leaned back in his chair and just gazed at her . " Well , I guess not . Especially if you like your bread the same size as the town hall . " Now thatwas something she would have said in one of her letters , and Clayton felt very heartened . He knew why he 'd come , but he did n't dare tell her that his sole reason was to learn if the girl from the letters really existed . " I read a story one time , " Jackie now spoke conversationally , feeling suddenly at ease . " It was about a woman who had black hair . It would fall in her face . Naturally she would push it back , even while she baked . The people in the town did not believe any  | work should be done on Sunday . She wholeheartedly agreed with this , except that she showed up at church one morning with flour in her hair . " Clayton smiled . " What did the people do ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and he had n't heard all the rules the town had imposed on itself . He took one look at her and fell in love , flour and all . " They both laughed at this , but it was short-lived . Clayton looked at Jackie 's eyes , and Jackie stared back , her hands still buried in the bowl . " I had to come , Jackie , " he whispered . " Your letters are doing things to my heart , and I had to come . " " I 'm glad you did . My mother asked me if I would ever go to see you . I told her I did n't think I 'd be welcome . " " You 'll have to tell her you were wrong . You 'd be very wel-come . " Jackie just looked at him . " I did n't remember how handsome you were , Clay . I 'd forgotten the way the sun bleaches your hair and the way it falls on your forehead . " You were about ten pounds lighter the last time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her hands working again . " I was a little upset . " Clayton was next to her before she could take another breath . Jackie turned and looked into his face . She loved the fact that he did n't tower over her . She knew Eddie loved Robert 's height , but it was not for her . Clayton had only to lean in order to press his lips against her forehead . Jackie blushed at her own thoughts . " You were more than a little upset , Jackie . " Clayton ignored the color in her face and went on . " I 'm sorry I was so insensitive . " " You were so pleased to be leaving , and I felt utterly crushed . It was n't anything I could really share with you . " " I understand . " " And now , " Jackie admitted painfully , " you 're here to find the girl in the letters . Well , I do n't know if you will , Clay . I mean , I just get all flustered when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She cut off when he placed two fingers over her mouth .  | " I want you to listen to me . Will you do that ? " Jackie could only nod . " Like I said , my heart is changing . For all I know , yours is too . I 'm here to see if there 's something between us , Jackie , not to hurt you or pressure you in any way . " Clayton finally moved his hand . " I felt it was best to be right up-front . " Jackie nodded . " Thank you , Clay . " She looked away to pick up the towel for her hands and then back at him . " I 'll go and find Mother now and ask her if you can stay . " " All right , but I think maybe I 'd better talk to her first . " Jackie looked at him for a moment but then understood . She found her mother in the living room and explained what she wanted . " Of course he can stay with us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure how to say it , " he wants to talk to you first . " Addy stared at her and then said , " Well , by all means , ask him to come in . " A moment later , when Clayton came alone to the living room , Addy was smiling . However , he looked so strained that she felt a prickling of fear . Had he told Jackie in plain terms that he was just here as a friend ? Or had he come to ask of becoming engaged ? When Addy had opened the door and seen him standing there , her heart had tripped with gladness . Was she right or wrong ? " Sit down , Clay . What can I do for you ? " " Thank you , Addy . I appreciate your hospitality , but I think I need to tell you that I 've come for a reason . " Addy leaned forward in her chair . " I 've come to see if the things I 'm feeling for Jackie are real . I think you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver , but I had to see her . If I still looked at her like a little sister , then I would n't hesitate to accept your offer , but I think you should know that my heart is changing . " " I see , " Addy said simply . " That is n't to say that I 'd dishonor her in any way , no matter how my feelings have changed , but I thought you should know . " 205  | Addy 's heart felt like a butterfly just released from its cocoon . " The fact that you 've come to me , Clay , and laid your heart at my feet , tells me that Morgan and I have nothing to worry about . " Clay smiled . His own heart was feeling a good deal lighter all of a sudden . " Thank you . I 'll go and tell Jackie . " Clayton rose to do this but never got to the door . " Clay is here ? " The shout could be heard from the other room , and then Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Sammy dragged him to the sofa and began a line of a thousand questions . She seemed to have no concept of how far Denver was from Boulder and asked if he ever saw Robert and Eddie . It took some time to explain the geography to her , and while they were talking , Jackie joined them . Clayton did n't spend the whole time gazing at her , but he knew she was there . And for today , that was enough .  | " Jackie is working today ? " Addy asked Morgan and then stared at him . He would n't look at her when he answered but bent over to fasten his shoes . " Yes . I need her . " " I know , Morgan , but Clay is here and I ? " " Yes , " he bit out suddenly . " Clay is here . And the next thing you know we 'll be watching our second daughter go away . " Addy sighed but kept quiet . Morgan had been in a terrible temper for weeks now , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night before as to why Clayton was in Georgetown . And why was it , she asked herself , that Morgan never had a problem before the man showed up . He would encourage the girls , telling them to write , delivering the gifts that were sent , and even listening to them chatter on and act all dreamy when the beloved 's name was mentioned . But when the man came on the scene , first Robert and now Clayton , Morgan was impossible to live with . Addy simply did not know what to think any more . " Morgan , please let her have some time off , " she tried again . " She works so hard and never complains . Please , Morgan . " But he was adamant . His mind made up , he left the bedroom and moved to the kitchen . However , he had n't reckoned with his daughter . Danny and Jackie were in the kitchen . Danny had just agreed to work for her older sister , but her father said no . Both girls stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Clayton was not to be seen at the moment , but Jackie did n't  | want to risk a scene in front of him . She followed her father o of the house . " Danny 's going to work for me , Father . " " No , Jack . " His tone told her not to argue , but she did n't heed it . " You come to the store as soon as you 've eaten . " " Why ? " " Just do as I tell you , Jack . " He was hitching the team now in a way that told his daughter he was finished . " I 'm going to spend the day with Clay , " Jackie said firmly . " Probably tomorrow too . " Morgan 's head rose slowly . " Are you defying me , Jack ? " " If that 's what it takes , " she stated with more calm than she felt . Morgan 's anger exploded . " How dare you ! " " How dare I what ? " Jackie was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store . Why do I have to be there ? " " I 'll thank you to remember , " Morgan bit out , " that you still sleep under my roof and eat my food , Jacqueline Fontaine . " " And I 'll thank you to remember that I put in 50 hours a week in the store and 30 during the school year without a dime to show for it . " Some of the wind went out of Morgan 's sails at that point , but Jackie went on quietly before he could speak . " I did n't know you felt that way . Maybe I 'll just not be a burden any longer . Maybe I 'll just go to Denver with Clay when he re-turns . " She turned to walk back to the house , but Morgan finally heard what he 'd been saying . " Jack . " She stopped but did n't turn around . " Please come here . " Jackie went then , but her expression was defensive . She did n't want to draw too close , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled her to him . He embraced her for a moment , and Jackie even hugged him in return . " Go with Clay today . Have a good time . "  | His voice sounded oddly strained to her ears , but she still nodded . " Thank you , Father . " Morgan went back to hitching the team , and Jackie went inside . Clayton was now in the kitchen and greeted her warmly , but Addy looked straight at her daughter . She asked to see Jackie upstairs , and the 17-year-old followed her mother from the room . " You had words with your father ? " Addy asked as soon as the bedroom door was closed . " Yes . He 's being completely unreasonable . " Jackie was still a little angry . " He pushes you around , but he 's not going to treat me that way . " " You will not speak to me in such a way , Jackie . " Addy 's voice told of her fury . " It 's true , Mother . You 're his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . " " You 're wrong , " Addy said coldly . " You do have to take it , and if this is the way you 're going to act when Clayton shows up , then maybe he should leave . " The anger left Jackie in a hurry . Her mother was rarely upset with her , and she felt terrible . She spoke again , but her voice was subdued . " He was wrong , Mother . What was I supposed to do ? " " You must respect him , Jackie . " " So you think I should have gone to the store ? " Addy suddenly felt tired beyond her years , and her face indicated as much . She turned away from Jackie and said , " I do n't know , Jackie . I just do n't know . " Silence dropped like a cloak onto the room . The clock could be heard chiming downstairs . Seven rings . So early in the day and already off on terrible footing . " What did you and your father fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me feel as though I do n't earn my keep . I never ask for money , Mother , you know that . So I told him that if he felt that way , maybe I should just go back to Denver with Clay . "  | Oh , Jackie , you must have crushed him with those words , her mother said to herself . Outloud she said , " What did he say ? " " He told me to go ahead and have my day . I think he was sorry , even though he did n't say it . " " So you did part on good terms ? " " Yes , but he still looked upset . " Jackie shook her head . " Why , Mother ? Why does he give us such a hard time ? " " It 's very involved , Jackie , and I 'm not sure I can explain . " Something in Addy 's voice bothered her daughter . " Does it have to do with the fact that you and Eddie do n't think Father 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , Mother , please do n't be angry with Eddie , but she was upset before she and Robert got married . I asked her why , and she said that sometimes Father 's lack of faith really upsets her . She told me she prayed for him every day . I did n't know what to say to her . It 's not true , is it , Mother ? Father will go to heaven , wo n't he ? I mean , he 's such a good man . " Oh , heavenly Father , Addy 's heart begged as the breath left her body , is she really so ignorant of the way of salvation ? Did her confession as a child mean so little , or have I been remiss in my explanation ? " Jackie , " Addy finally spoke very slowly . " Do you really not understand about salvation by grace , not works ? " " Well , yes , I do , but I just ca n't believe that God would keep a good man like Father out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for talking that way too . " A knock sounded on the door just then , and Addy did not get a chance to reply . Lexa stuck her head in and spoke to Jackie . " Clayton has n't said anything , Jackie , but he keeps looking toward the stairs . I think you should come down . " ' All right , " Jackie answered and turned toward the door . She was almost out when she remembered her mother . " I 'm sorry , Mother . Was that all ? " The timing was wrong , and Addy knew it . She wanted to sit her daughter down and talk this out , but her heart would not be in it . The older woman eventually nodded her head and told Jackie  | to run along . She was in need of breakfast , but she had no appetite . Addy sank down onto the bed and prayed for a long time . " Here 's your favorite . A wild rose . " Clayton held the flower beneath Jackie 's nose . She breathed deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught her hand when she tried to move it . " Now , do n't you touch it , " he scolded . " I 've got it just right . " She laughed . " It feels like it 's sticking straight up in the air . " " Well , it is . What else is it supposed to do ? " Jackie took her hand back and reached for the flower . She placed it behind her ear , a vast improvement , and then posed . " Well , " Clayton admitted grudgingly . " I guess it looks a little better . " Jackie smiled at him and turned away from the warmth she saw in his eyes . She began to repack the picnic lunch they 'd enjoyed . Clayton lay down on the pale yellow blanket , supported by one elbow . " Why do you do that ? " he asked nonchalantly as he fiddled with a blade of grass . " Do what ? " " Why do you get busy with your hands every time I look at you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . What could she say to him ? I 'm sorry , Clayton , but if I look at you and think I see love in your eyes when there 's not , I 'm going to be hurt beyond all repair . The thought alone was enough to make her speechless with embarrassment . " Ca n't answer , " he coaxed softly , " or do n't want to ? " " Oh , Clay , it 's just that ? " Jackie cut off and looked at him . He was n't looking at her with warm interest now . Now he was just Clayton , and she felt a little better . " I think I 'm afraid for you to know how I really feel , and I 'm afraid that if you look at me too long , I wo n't have a secret left . "  | Clayton smiled gently . " You do tend to carry your emotions in your eyes . Jackie had to agree . Her family always knew what she was think-ing . " Did you by any chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I did . " " Did it concern me ? " Jackie nodded miserably . " Danny said she 'd work for me , but he said I had to come in . We fought , but then he changed his mind . " " Is it me , specifically , Jackie , or any man ? " Jackie was so stunned by this question that for a moment she sat quietly . " I never thought about it before , but it is all men . I mean , Robert is a wonderful man , but Father had a terrible time when he came . He kept it covered up most of the time , but we could tell . No , Clay , it 's not you . It 's Father . I think he sees all men as a threat to our family . " " Well , in some ways they are . " " I do n't know what you mean . " Clayton chuckled and tossed the blade of grass he 'd been holding . " Robert did n't come here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie . Six months later , she was gone . And now I 'm sure your mother must have told your father that I 'm here to find out our feelings for each other . The man 's not blind , Jackie ; he can see the way I look at you . " " And how do you look at me ? " The question escaped with no premeditation , but Jackie felt immediately better . Clayton grew very serious . " It 's like the letter you wrote me a long time ago about the wildflowers . For a while looking at them is enough , but then you want to touch . To really experience them , you need to hold them in your hands , smell them , and even rub them on your skin . I love looking at you , Jackie , but your father 's a married man . He knows very well that I want to kiss you and hold you . Jackie nearly panicked , but managed to speak .  | " You 've never talked about that in your letters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jackie could n't take her eyes from him . She wanted to ; she wanted to busy her hands and mind a thousand miles from here , but she had to look into his eyes . " I 'm surprised you did n't start packing the lunch again . " Clay had looked back at her , but now his eyes were smiling . " I probably should , Clay , or I 'm going to be the one to kiss you . " She so shocked him with that statement that his mouth came open . Jackie found this very amusing . Her laughter bounced over the meadow , and her grin was cheeky . The intense moment was broken , and right now it was for the best . Addy waited until Morgan was finished with his customer and then approached . She was n't fast enough , however . One of the older ladies in town snagged her , and she was tied up showing her bolt after bolt of fabric until the woman decided to go home and think it over . It seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been . Morgan was leaning against the doorframe of the back room , just watching her . She hesitated in her step but kept on . When she neared , he dropped back into the room itself and over to the window . The act gave them privacy , and the window gave them light . Looking down at her , Morgan stood in profile to the glass , his arms crossed over his chest . For a moment Addy felt like she was the one he 'd fought with . She could n't quite meet his eye . " I was furious with Jackie when she told me she 'd had words with you . " " I thought you would be angry with me , " Morgan admitted quietly . " I was , but not furious like with Jackie . " " She was right , you know . I was being unreasonable . " ' And she was being disrespectful . I wo n't stand for that . "  | Morgan nodded but did not comment . It was n't every man whose wife stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool . " I want to understand , Morgan , but I do n't , " she said suddenly . " Why could you take me thousands of miles away from my family , but not be willing to have anyone do that to your daughters ? " Morgan 's gaze shifted out the window . The back of the building looked out over the mountains . It was beautiful beyond description . He honestly could n't understand why anyone would want to live anywhere else , but he reminded himself that he had n't seen the rest of Colorado 's territory . It could be just as beautiful . In fact , if Eddie 's letters could be trusted , it certainly was . " I just take longer to adjust than you do , Addy . I 'll get used to the idea of Jackie and Clay . Give me time . " " I 'm glad to hear that , Morgan , but you 've been simmering with anger since Robert and Eddie left . Why ca n't you go see them ? Go see how happy Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to rest . " " Go on my own ? " he asked incredulously . " Well , yes . I thought if I suggested we all go , you 'd say we could n't afford it . If you go alone , I 'll be here to watch the store . " " I can always close the store , " he mumbled . Addy 's heart leapt . The hope must have shown in her eyes because Morgan reached for her . " I 'll think about it . All right ? " She nodded against his chest . " Maybe this fall . All six of us . " Addy looked into his eyes . " Thank you . " " For what ? I could still say no . " " I know , but your willingness to work on it makes it so much better . " He kissed her then , a long passionate kiss that dislodged hair pins and turned her face a bright pink . Coming into the back , Danny heard their low voices and moved back out front . Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the store . Danny decided her mother should come every day .  | Clayton leaned forward and gently pressed his lips to Jackie 's brow . When he moved away , she looked into his eyes and admitted , " I 've wanted you to do that for the longest time . " Clayton 's eyes burned into hers , and a moment later , he lowered his head . Jackie back-pedaled as fast as she could go , a hand to his chest as she moved her head back . " I do n't think I meant to say that . " Her voice was in a panic . Clayton did n't push the point , but his eyes were eating up every inch of her face . " Why ca n't I kiss you ? " he finally managed . " Because you ca n't know if you love me in five days ' time . " " How much do you want to bet ? " She really wanted to run then , but he caught her and held her by the upper arms . So much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked at the store some , but Clayton was with her even there . They 'd talked of everything under the sun , and Clayton had finally come to realize that the only thing he could be feeling for this woman was love . After the picnic the first day , they 'd walked home talking all the way . With the passion of the moment behind them , they were able to discuss the possibility of kissing . Clayton told Jackie before they reached her house that he would not kiss her unless he was certain he loved her . Jackie had thanked him , knowing it was going to be hard , but very grateful for his honor in the situation .  | And now they were outside after dinner . It was still quite light but they could feel evening descending . They had walked around the side of the barn and stood talking . Clayton had surprised Jacki when he turned and kissed her brow , but she enjoyed it . Now the hands that held her upper arms went around her ba Clayton pulled her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder . How long had she dreamed of being het by him ? But nothing could have prepared her for the real thing . Clayton 's shoulders were broad , and his chest was hard . H did n't press his advantage in any way , but Jackie felt cherished and desired . It was a lovely time for the two of them , interrupted only by his next statement . " I need to leave in a few days . " Jackie raised her head . " So soon ? " " Yes . I 'll miss a little class time as it is . " " When will I see you again ? " Clayton sighed . " I wo n't be done with school until next sprin and I know your father would never agree to your coming an finding a place to live in Denver now . " " But you will come back ? " " Jackie , " Clayton sounded stunned . " If you can doubt that , then I have n't told you how I really feel . " The sun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a perfect view of her face . She looked utterly vulnerable at that moment and he asked God to help him be the husband she needed . He did n't think that now was the time to propose , but he could tell Jackie that he loved her . " I love you , Jackie , and if you 'll have me , I 'll return in the spring and show you how much I mean it . " " Oh , Clayton , I 've loved you forever . " She sounded young and ardent , and Clayton 's heart felt very tender . He did kiss her then , but it was a gentle kiss , a kiss of promise for things to come . " I 've got to discuss this with your parents . " " Yes . I 'll go with you . "  | But when the time came later that evening , Clayton was honest with Jackie and told her he 'd rather she wait in the other room . She agreed , but it was n't easy . " I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her parents , " but I have told her that I love her . We plan to continue our letters to each other , and when I do propose , it probably will be by mail . I 'd like to come next year for a spring wedding , but it all depends on whether I get work . " I have n't told you all of this in complete disregard of your wishes , but now that you know what I 'd like to do , I 'd like you to tell me if you think I 'll suit . In other words , may I court your daughter , Jackie ? " " Yes , Clay , you may , " Morgan answered immediately and surprised Addy into staring at him . " I 've already given it great thought . It would please me beyond all reason to see you settle here , but whether or not you do , I know Jackie loves you , and I know you 'll take care of her . " " Thank you , sir . " Clayton was a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long afterward he joined Jackie in the kitchen . " Well , I did n't ask for your hand in marriage , but I did tell them that I hoped it would come to that . The only thing I really requested was to court you . " " What did Father say ? " " Yes . " " Yes ? Just like that ? " " He did n't even hesitate . " Jackie threw her arms around him for just an instant , and then they sat at the table , heads close and talking . " Father 's been more gentle in the last few days than I 've seen him in a long time . " " Months ago now Eddie told me that she prayed for his salvation every day . I 've prayed for him as well , Jackie . I wanted you to know that . " Jackie 's face looked troubled . " It 's funny you should mention it , Clay . Mother came to my room just two nights ago to kiss me  | good-night and questioned me for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her worry about my going to heaven . " " Did you clear things up ? " " I think so , at least I feel all right about it . " " Good . When did you come to Christ , Jackie ? Were you a child ? " Jackie shrugged . " I 've just always been , Clayton . For as long as I can remember . " Clayton had never heard it put that way before . He was thinking on the subject when Jackie started to talk about Robert and Eddie . The young couple visited for another half hour in the kitchen and then joined the rest of the family in the living room . Clayton left three days later , but there was no grief on Jackie 's part this time . He loved her , and if he was hired somewhere to teach , then in the spring they could be married . God had taken care of every other need , and Jackie knew He would bring them together . She also knew that nothing in the world could dim the happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was walking on a cloud . Clayton loves me , Eddie . I did n't think I would ever be able to say those words , but he does . It had taken Jackie a few weeks to come back to earth , but now she had to write and let her sister know that she was in love with a man who loved her in return . I never completely understood the way you floated around after Robert had been here , but I do now . I 'm 170 and I 'm in love . I ca n't believe it . It feels so good to write to you about this . When Eddie received the letter , she could only shake her head . She read it to Robert , and they both laughed . Every paragraph was about Clayton or his time with Jackie . She had written about everything they 'd done and talked about . " And how long does it say they 'll need to wait ? " " Next spring , " Eddie told her husband . He now shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a long winter . "  | Jackie began school with much the same feeling as ever . Danny , Lexa , and Sammy were all glad to be back , but Jackie 's heart was not in it . Her mother had had a talk with her about attitude , and although she was still struggling , she was working on it . " I do n't feel like a schoolgirl anymore , Mother . I 'm contemplating marriage , and I just do n't want to study math . " Addy stroked her hair . " I can see that it 's going to be hard , dear ; indeed , it 's going to take a real step of maturity to deal with this . " Addy inadvertently challenged Jackie with those words . More than anything else , Jackie wanted Clayton to see her as a mature woman . She thought about the letter she 'd already started , the one that did nothing but complain about returning to school . She decided then and there to tear it up and start another one . It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was doing well . Her father had cut her hours in the store , but she still worked all day Saturday and two afternoons during the week . She really did enjoy it , especially when she could rearrange the stock room . " I can put this heavy stuff at the top , " Morgan told her when she arrived one Tuesday after school , " but please work on these lower shelves . " ' All right . Call me if you need me out front . " Morgan suddenly hugged her . " What was that for ? " Jackie was very pleased . " I do n't know . You 're so cheerful and helpful these days . I think being in love suits you very well . " The young woman beamed at him and went to work . She was fast and efficient , and because her father did n't call her to the front at all , she was finished with the low shelves very swiftly . Morgan had said he would do the top shelves , but Jackie saw no need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tins of syrup and pails of river salmon . She was getting tired after two or three trips , but she had only two to go and stuck with it . Jackie had not faltered a single step in the last two hours , but suddenly , before she could put the tin in place , she was falling from more than six feet in the air , the tin coming down on top of her .  | Morgan heard the crash from the front and walked swiftly away from the customer he was serving . Seeing Jackie unconscious on her back was nearly enough to make his heart stop . He ran to the front long enough to send the customer for the doctor and then back to his daughter 's side . Bile rose in his throat as he saw that her nose and mouth were both bleeding . He could n't stand the thought that she would be in pain , so he did n't try to wake her . He left her lying flat , praying for the doctor to arrive soon . He wished he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened , not even when , accompanied by young Doc Edwardson , they took her home in the back of the wagon and carried her to her room . An hour later , the screams that came from Jackie 's room so terrified Sammy that Addy took her downstairs . Lexa and Danny stood huddled in the hallway while the doctor and their father remained inside . " Try to keep her still , " Doc Edwardson gasped as he grabbed for Jackie 's flailing arms . Morgan would have been better at that position , but he 'd grabbed her legs and still tried to reason with her from further down the bed . " Jackie , it 's all right , " he called to her . " I 'm right here . " Help me ! " she replied hysterically . " Jackie , " he tried again , but at that moment , she swung her own arm against her head and went completely still . Both men froze , Morgan 's pale face going even whiter . He looked at his daughter 's still form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What happened ? " He demanded , his voice hushed . " She 's fainted , " the doctor told him . Both men were panting . Morgan 's tortured eyes went back to Jackie and then to the doctor once again . " Please tell me it is n't so . " " I ca n't . " The younger man rose slowly , his voice hushed as he gently put Jackie 's arms at her side . " I saw this just recently , I 'm  | sorry to say . There 's not a thing that can be done . " He looked at Morgan . " I 'll sit with her , Morgan . Go and see your family . They need to know , and you need each other right now . " " You 're sure ? " Morgan asked , tears filling his eyes , and the doctor knew to what he referred . " I 'm sorry , Morgan , " he said resignedly . " I have n't seen much of this , but enough to know . The way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else . " Morgan stumbled to the door and then out into the hall . Danny 's and Lexa 's soft cries met his ears , and he went to them . He held them close for a moment . " Where 's your mother ? " " She took Sammy to the kitchen . " " Come on . I 've got to see her . " It was a pitiful group that huddled close and descended the stairs . Addy came to her feet as soon as she saw them , her hand going instinctively to Sammy 's shoulder . " Oh , no , Morgan , " Addy gasped when she saw his face . " She 's not dead . Please do n't tell me she 's dead . " " No , she 's not . " He looked at Addy , but did n't really focus . " But she 's blind , Addy . Completely blind . She 'll never see again . " Dark spots danced before Addy 's eyes . One minute she was standing and the next she was crumpled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Mother ! " the terrified voice called , and Addy rushed to her daughter 's side . " I 'm here , Jackie . It 's all right . I 'm right here . " Jackie clung to her mother , trembling from head to foot . Jackie 's fear of the dark had begun during childhood . Now she 'd been plunged into a sea of blackness , and the slightest change set her off . Just now the wind had kicked up outside , and she 'd heard a strange noise . It had been happening off and on for days . Addy 's face was drawn with exhaustion , but Jackie could n't see this . " Here , " Addy suggested , " the sun is shining right through this window . Move to the sofa now , and you 'll be able to feel it . " " Help me , " Jackie whimpered . " I 'm here . Take my hand . " They made the move with Jackie clutching at her mother 's arm . Addy 's skin was already bruised and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Jackie hit a sore spot . When Jackie was settled , Addy sank into a chair of her own and just stared into space . She was n't certain how much longer she could do this . It was three weeks to the day since Jackie had fallen in the store , and although her headaches had abated , Jackie was terrified most of the time . The rest of the household had finally learned to sleep through her cries in the night , but Addy went to her every time . She never calmed down in less than two hours , and the days were not much better .  | One afternoon just that week after a particularly difficult night , Addy fell into such a hard sleep in a living room chair that by the time she heard Jackie 's cries the younger woman was inconsolable . Jackie had been almost impossible to live with since , terrified that she was being left alone in her blackness . Attempts to comfort her with Scripture , God 's promises to never leave His children , fell on deaf ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it hard to have little ones under foot , but nothing could have prepared her for having a 17-year-old baby . She was dressing Jackie , giving her baths , and helping her eat . Addy did n't know how much more she could take . From where she sat in the chair , she now rocked her head and looked at Jackie . The blind girl just sat there . Addy tried to understand but could n't . Jackie did n't talk anymore or ask questions . Her world had shrunk until she was the only one who existed . It 's too soon , Addy told herself , but then an unfair thought came to mind . Jackie had always been more self  --  centered than any of the other children . Blind or not , Addy did n't believe she herself would be so unreasonable . A minute later guilt poured over her . She felt terrible for thinking this way . She was praying , trying to explain her weary heart to God , when she heard someone knock at the front door . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just someone at the door . " Addy rose to answer it . " Are you leaving ? " Jackie 's hands were outstretched , and Addy rushed to her . " I 'm just going to answer the door , " Addy answered . Jackie calmed a little at her touch . " Just sit tight ; I 'll be right back . " Jackie was shaking again , but Addy left her and rushed to the door . She was rather startled to see Mrs. Munroe standing on the small porch . Pastor had visited twice , but his wife , who was often busy with the town orphans , was the last person Addy expected . However , she was not unwelcome . " I hope I wo n't be intruding , Addy , but I thought I could be of some help . "  | " Oh , " Addy 's manners returned to her in a rush . " Of cou Ora , please come in . " Ora Munroe was just two steps into the house when Jackie up a hue and cry . Addy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . followed slowly . By the time she calmed Jackie down , the of woman was standing silently in the doorway . " Come in , Ora , " she bade gently , telling herself to forget dust and grime that seemed to pervade the room , indeed , whole house . " Thank you . " " Mrs. Munroe is here , Jackie . " " Hello , Jackie , " Ora greeted her softly . " Hello . " Jackie 's voice was dull . " How is your shoulder ? " Jackie did n't answer . Addy looked apologetic and spoke fo her . " It 's fine really , just very bruised . Those tins of syrup are quite heavy . Doc Edwardson was rather surprised she had n't broken any bones . " Ora nodded , and a momentary silence fell on the threesome . It did n't last , however , as Jackie suddenly lost her mother and began to call to her in terror . Addy was standing to go to her when Ora spotted a bruise and a scratch on her arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Answer her from here , " she said quietly . For a moment , Addy only stared at her . " Sit back down , Addy , and answer her from your place in the chair . " " Mother ! Mother ! " The cries escalated , but Addy made herself sit back down . " I 'm right here , Jackie ; right in my chair . " " Mother . " Again Jackie 's hands were outstretched , unseeing eyes searching frantically . Addy began to panic herself and turned to their guest , but Ora only shook her head .  | " Jackie . " The strange voice caught her attention . She 'd forgotten anyone else was there . " Your mother is right here . She 's going to answer you from her seat . " Ora urged Addy with her head . " I 'm right here , Jackie . Can you hear me ? " " Yes , but I need to touch you . " Jackie was crying now . Ora shook her head vehemently . " I 'm right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she managed the words . You can hear me . " Jackie 's hands began to twist and flap . She was on the verge of hysteria . " I have to touch you , " she sobbed . " No , " Addy now said on her own . " I 'm right here . Just listen to the sound of my voice . " " I ca n't . " " Yes , you can , " Ora put in . " In fact , you can tell by the sound of her voice how your mother is feeling . " Jackie was shaking her head , but Ora went on , her soft voice compelling . " Listen to your mother , Jackie , and tell me if she 's angry . " Addy picked up her cue . " I 'm right here , Jackie , right here in the room with you . " Jackie was still moving fretfully , but she was listening too . " Is she angry , Jackie ? " " No , but I need to touch her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a trick on you ? " " No . " Jackie 's movements were calming . " No , she is n't , is she ? If your mother tells you she 's right in the room , then you know she 's going to be here . " Jackie 's breathing was returning to normal , and her hands now lay still in her lap . " Go to her , Addy , " Ora instructed , and when she did , Jac kic clung to her in relief . Addy smoothed her hair and nestled Jackie against her . The exercise had been as draining for her as it was for Jackie . She finally looked to Ora.  | " My mother was blind , " the pastor 's wife stated quietly . think I can be of help to you . " " If you run your right hand along the edge of the plate , Jackie , you will feel your cup . " Jackie 's hand came to the table top . She bumped her knife and spoon but found the plate . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have put her hand right in the food . " You must move slower , dear , " Ora cautioned her . " Slow movements at all times , until you 've found your way . " Jackie 's left hand gripped the edge of the table , and Ora prepared herself for the outburst . They 'd been working for two hours every morning for six weeks , and she knew all the signs . The progress had been very slow , but Ora was patient beyond all descrip-tion . " No one is going to clean up any messes you make today , Jackie . If you break another plate , you 'll clean up the glass on your own . At first Jackie was so shocked she could n't speak , but a moment later she let out a howl . " Mother ! Mother ! " " Listen , Jackie . " Ora 's voice got through when Jackie was taking a breath . " She heard you upstairs . Listen to her footsteps on the stairs . " Jackie forgot her earlier irritation until she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jackie ; you can see without your eyes . " " Do n't say that to me ! " she said through gritted teeth . " But it 's true , " Ora insisted . ' And as soon as you realize it , you 're going to feel set free . " Jackie was still breathing heavily with irritation when her mother entered . " Did you call me , Jackie ? "  | " Yes . I 'm through for the day . " She started to rise . " Take me upstairs . " " If you want to get upstairs , " Ora cut in , " you 'll have to go on your own . " " Mother ! " she immediately cried . " Help me , Mother . " Ora did n't look at Addy or Jackie . She sat at the table and let them decide . In the past , Addy had often helped when she should n't have . Ora had told her that in the long run it would make things worse , but too often Addy had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , " Addy said softly , " that I 'll let you go on your own today . " Jackie sat back down and began to cry . The women did not touch her or speak to her , and soon her tears became sobs . Morgan chose that moment to come in the door . " What is it ? " he asked immediately , not seeing anyone but Jackie . " Oh , Father , " she cried , taking immediate advantage . " I just want to go upstairs . " " I 'll take you , honey , " he offered and went right to her . So taken was he with Jackie 's fear that he did n't even notice his wife 's face . Without further word to anyone , he took Jackie to her room . Addy and Ora stared at each other before Addy admitted quietly , " Christmas is three-and-a-half-weeks away , and a week after that is Jackie 's birthday . I wish they were already over . " " How can I clean it if I ca n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Addy ignored it . " It does n't have to be perfect , but you can tell where the polish is . Just try . " " No . I do n't want it all over me . " Addy worked to tamp down her own anger . If she told Jackie what she was really thinking , that she was a self  --  centered brat , it  | would crush her . However , she was not going to take no for an an-swer . " I want you to do this , " Addy said in an even tone . " I want you to at least try to polish this platter . If you do n't , I wo n't read to you tonight at bedtime . " " You 're treating me like a child , " Jackie whimpered . " Because you 're acting like one , " Addy snapped . She stopped herself just short of asking , What would Clayton say ? But he was not mentioned anymore . His letters to Jackie were stacked unopened in her room , untouched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly after a moment of uncomfortable silence . Addy thanked her and moved from the room . I must stop this , Lord . I question You at every turn . I want answers as to how I 'm going to carry on and how much longer I must struggle , but You have kept silent . I am becoming frustrated and distant with You , and I ca n't stand it . Addy heard the sound of her own thoughts and knew that she alone must deal with her anger and apathy . She took the first chair she could find and began to pray . Years ago she 'd heard a preacher say , " The moment you do n't feel like praying , get on your knees . And the moment you do n't feel like reading your Bible , you 'd better get that Book open . " The words came to her now , and Addy prayed . She did n't have the energy to go upstairs for her Bible , but she did pray . She confessed her anger and asked God for the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time later , and she went to her , still praying . She talked to the Lord all the way to bedtime that night when she could finally escape to the quiet of her bedroom and write a letter to Eddie . She needed someone who would listen . Eddie seemed the ideal choice . Addy was tired enough to go to bed and sleep for 12 hours , but she fought the urge , sat down at her desk , and put ink to paper .  | Morgan climbed the stairs to the bedroom late that same night . He was bone tired and told himself that he did n't really need to be at the store at 6:00 . In fact , he had gotten so much done today , he did n't need to be there until right before opening at 8:00 . Morgan was contemplating the loveliness of turning over in the morning and going back to sleep when he opened the door and found Addy slumped over the writing desk . The lantern was burning , but she was sound asleep . He nearly shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye caught some of the words of her letter to Eddie . Morgan carefully slid the paper from under her hand and moved beside her to catch the light . Jackie looks like a scarecrow , and so do I. Never has weight control been so little a problem . Jackie actually polished a platter for me today but then threw a fit when I did n't get the polish off of her hands fast enough . I have prayed more today than I have in weeks , but never have I been so lonely . With Jackie not at the store to help him , Morgan is putting in double the hours , and knowing how much he worked before you can well imagine how little I see of him . When I came upstairs for the night , he was n't even home yet . I do n't know if the store needs him that badly or if he is running from this situation . I have been tempted to run myself . I long for you , Eddie , as I have never done before . Please pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . I have n't even written to her . Every time I try to sit down and talk with Danny , Jackie screams for something . I know it 's best to make her do things for herself , but most of the time I do not have the fortitude to deny her . She is still too dependent on me . I ask myself when enough is enough but gain no answers . I keep making excuses for her , telling myself that she needs more time , but they are hollow excuses even to my own ears .  | I believe God is sovereign , and I believe He loves me , but I feel so frail . I ask Him to ease this load , but He has said no . I must carry on here , and for this I covet your prayers . I have an 18-year-old infant on my hands , an unsaved husband , and three other daughters who have n't had my attention since September 27 of last year . I have n't seen the inside of the church since that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at times I think I will break under the strain of it all . February is just around the corner , and I am asking God for something special . Maybe the snows wo n't be so harsh this late in the winter and spring will come early . This really would uplift my heart , especially if I could take Jackie outside or more folks would visit . Right now no one wants to be around her . At this point , I 'd even enjoy working at the store instead of being with Jackie , but she will have no one but me or Morgan , and I 've already told you where Morgan is most of the time . I ask again , Eddie , please pray for me . Morgan set the letter down and saw that his hand was shaking . He put his hand on Addy 's shoulders and cringed at the feel of her bones protruding under her flesh . How long since he 'd last touched her ? " Come on , Addy , " he spoke softly as he tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm coming , Jackie , " she mumbled incoherently . " Come to bed , honey . " Morgan now lifted her and laid her on the bed . He removed her dress but left her in her shift . He divested her of shoes and stockings and then pulled the covers over her . She slept through it all . Morgan undressed himself and joined her , his head going down heavily on his own pillow . He did n't roll close to Addy , but lay very still . He had been so tired when he 'd climbed the stairs , but now he felt wide awake . He saw the words on the letter again , and something terrible squeezed around his heart .  | Robert and Eddie received Addy 's letter on February 17 . Eddie was inconsolable for long minutes to follow . Indeed , Robert had been forced to read it to her , and he cried as well . They had certainly known about Jackie 's blindness and been in touch often , but never had Addy unburdened as she 'd done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little and then told her what was on his heart concerning Jackie 's spiritual status . When he was finished she cried yet again , but Robert was patient , his own throat feeling rather tight . " I have to do something , Robert , " Eddie sobbed , her face still streaked with tears . " I ca n't play God , Robert , but there must be something . Please tell me what to do . " Robert smoothed her hair and used his own handkerchief on her face . " I have an idea , Eddie , but I do n't know what you 'll say . As with your mother , the burden would fall mainly on you . " Eddie looked at him . " Tell me , Robert , " she whispered . " Whatever it is , tell me . " Robert 's voice was even and well modulated as he told Eddie what was in his heart , but it was not easy . Eddie cried some more , but in the end she put her arms around him and held him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was better than aimlessly waiting . With that in mind she could wait for the spring .  | " Write it , Lexa , " Jackie ordered her miserable sister . " Write it now . " Why , Jackie , why me ? " " Because your handwriting is the most like mine . Now , write what I tell you . " " But what about all of his letters ? Do n't you at least want to hear what he has to say ? " " Tell me , Lexa , " Jackie said , her voice biting , low and furious . " Will you marry a blind man someday ? Would n't it be exciting to marry a man who could never see you ? You could guide him around like a stumbling child for the rest of your life . Now would n't that be fun ? " Lexa was openly sobbing now , but Jackie 's heart hardened to the sound . " Write , Lexa . " Still sniffing , Lexa adjusted the paper . Jackie heard the rustle and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Dear Clay ' ? " " Clay ! " Jackie spoke firmly . The younger girl tried to keep her hand from shaking . Why , she begged silently , is this my Sunday to sit with Jackie ? " Okay , what now ? " she managed . " I have met someone else , " Jackie recited in a cold voice , " and fallen in love . " She waited a moment , listening to the pen . " I never wish to see or hear from you again . Jackie . " " Oh , Jackie , " Lexa began . " Write it ! " Lexa was dying inside . She did n't know when she had been so upset . The whole house had been turned upside down last year , and they 'd all walked around in a stupor until just a few weeks ago when their father got them all involved in Jackie 's care . It was n't that they had n't tried before , but Jackie never wanted it . Now , in order to ease Addy 's load , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | At first Jackie fought it , but the first time he 'd stayed with Jackie himself and went so far as to take Addy from the house was a breakthrough . Jackie was out of control at the beginning , but now they 'd developed a bit of a pattern . Today was Sunday . The rest of the family was at church , and Lexa had been put in charge . Not only was she to keep an eye on Jackie , she was to start lunch . Until this new schedule had begun , none of them had realized the stress their mother had been under . " Do n't forget to date it , " Jackie added , breaking Lexa from her thoughts . " I wo n't . " Lexa was still so shaken she could hardly think . " What is the date today ? " Jackie demanded . " March 12 . " Jackie did n't speak , but bitterness coiled like a snake inside of her . Not even six months since her fall , but it felt like years . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that would never change .. Clayton would go on . He would read the letter and hurt for a time , but then he 'd find someone new , marry her , and live forever in happiness . He 'd probably become a father . The thought so pained Jackie that she gasped . " What is it ? " Lexa asked . " Nothing . Have you got it ready ? " " Yes . " " Dated ? " " Yes . " " Good . Now tomorrow , right after school , you take it and post it . No one is to know , do you hear me , Lexa ? No one ! And do n't get any ideas in your head about writing to Clay . " " Do n't you think he already knows , Jackie ? Eddie or someone must have told him . " " No , " Jackie said with confidence . " He does n't know . I 'm sure of it . " " How can you be ? " " Because he 's still writing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never hear from him again . This way is best . He 'll hate me , and that 'll be the end of it . "  | Lexa could n't find anything to say to this . She wanted nothing to do with this horrid scheme , but she felt trapped . For just an instant she wanted to strike her sister . She wanted to lash out , call her names , and rail at her for climbing that ladder , but when she looked up , Jackie wore such a look of utter hopelessness and despair that Lexa was crushed . She prayed as she 'd been doing for the past five months . What are we going to do , Lord ? What are we going to do ? Denver Clayton 's hands shook as he opened the letter . Even without seeing the contents , he knew Jackie 's hand . She had n't written in six months , and he 'd about given up hope . He laughed at his own reaction to a simple letter , but still his hand shook . " Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Clayton read it over twice and then one more time . He stared at the words but could n't take them in . He sat slowly on his chair . On his desk lay her last letter , dated in September . He 'd read it so many times that it was torn and smudged . How could this happen ? The letter from the fall was filled with happiness and love  --  love for him . Oh , Jackie , his heart cried . How could you do this to us ? We love each other . The flow of Clayton 's heart stopped . We did love each other . Now it 's just me . Clayton realized how true it was . Jackie might have fallen for someone else , but Clayton would never . The pain squeezing his heart was like a steel band . He looked down in front of him and spotted the letters he 'd been writing . He was applying to three different positions he 'd read about in the Denver newspaper . The one on top was addressed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and crumpled it into a ball . He might not hate Jackie or believe he could ever love again , but neither could he move there , teach school , and live near her and her new love . Again pain tore through him , and a sob broke from his throat . His mother , who came to tell him dinner was ready , found him  | crying at his desk . He told her the whole story but felt no relief . She cried with him but urged him to eat . He was n't hungry . Right now he did n't think he 'd ever be hungry again . Robert and Eddie had prayed for an opening in the weather , and God gave them a time . They arrived in Georgetown on April 27 . It was a surprise to all , but mostly to Addy . She never dreamed they 'd come when there was still such a strong chance of snow , but she was thrilled to have them . As she stood in the kitchen with them , however , a strained look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is , " Eddie said quietly and before her mother could speak . " He 's in the stable now , putting the horses in for the night . " " Your father 's here ? " Addy was amazed . " It 's only 2:00 , and no one else is with him today . The girls are n't even home from school yet . " He closed the store for the day and brought us in the wagon , " Robert put in . " We told him we ca n't stay long , and he said he did n't want to miss any time with us . " " Why are you here ? " Addy was completely confused . " To take Jackie back to Boulder with us , " Robert stated . Addy began to shake her head , but Eddie spoke up , " No , Mother . Do n't try to get used to the idea right now . Just let it sink in . " " Eddie , you do n't know what you 're saying . You 've never seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm . " It 's going to be all right , " he said gently . " What if she says no ? " Addy asked just as Morgan was coming in the back door . " What if Jackie refuses to go ? " " She 's not going to be given a choice , " Morgan said kindly , but with a note of steel . " And neither are you , Addy . It does n't have to be forever , but Robert and Eddie are right . It 's time for this . " Addy nodded but had one more comment . " I wo n't tell you no , but I will say this  --  you have n't seen her or talked to her . It may not be me who changes my mind . "  | Robert and Eddie both looked at her . A moment later , the air was split by Jackie 's piercing voice . The adults all exchanged looks , and then Eddie 's chin went into the air . She was thinking , Your big sister has come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glint in her eye . Jackie trembled from head to foot as she clung to Robert 's arm , and her shakes were from far more than the cold . The journey to Boulder was ending , and she was so frightened that she could hardly breathe or move . How could they have done this ? How could they have sent her away ? She knew her home . She knew every inch of it . She had said this to her father , but he 'd shocked her with his reply . " You may know this house , Jack , but what 's the point ? You wo n't move an inch for fear of falling or bumping into something , and so you expect everyone to wait on you . Your mother should n't have to take it anymore , and I refuse to . You 're going to go with Eddie and Robert , and you 're going to do as you 're told . We 'll come to see how you 're doing  --  maybe this summer or fall . But you are going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was no use . Four days later , on May 1 , 1876 , Jackie was packed up and taken to the stage office . Robert and Eddie were with her , but she was not comforted . She cried and trembled until Robert told her in no uncertain terms that the tears would stop . His voice was normal , kind even , but he made his feelings quite clear . Jackie told herself she did n't have to obey . After all , what could he do ? But she did n't have the fortitude to cause a scene when the blackness around her seemed darker than ever . It might have helped if she 'd realized that Eddie had been crying with pain for her , but so caught up was she in her own little world that she was not aware of this . " Okay , " Robert spoke from above her head . " Let 's count . " " Count ? " she asked breathlessly .  | " That 's right . These are the front steps to our home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you 'll fall when you do them yourself . " Jackie would have denied him this , but he started forward , counting out loud at the same time . She had no choice but to fol-low . " Ten , eleven , and twelve . There ! We 're at the top . Now five more steps forward and we 'll be at the front door . Here we go . Good . Now straight in front of you is the staircase . You 're going to go up it . Count six steps and then the landing . I 'll be right behind you . " Jackie was in a daze . The cold was receding , and a strange rug was beneath her feet . She grasped the wide banister and felt like she 'd come into a huge cavern . She could smell a fire burning and even feel the warmth , but no light reached her eyes . " Eddie ! " Jackie cried so piteously that Robert had to hold his wife by the arm . " I 'm right here , Jackie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing just great . " " I 'll fall , " she whispered . " No , you wo n't . " Robert had let go of Eddie . " I 'm right behind you . Are you counting ? " " No . " " Well , get at it . What did I tell you ? " " Six steps and then the landing . " " Excellent . " Robert was very pleased because he was n't certain she 'd been listening . " And once on the landing you 'll just circle it , keeping your left hand on the big ball , and then you 'll have eight more steps to the top . " ' All right . Is it hot in here ? " " Oh , here , " Robert came forward . " Let me have your coat . " " Will I ever get it back ? " " Of course , " he laughed . " It 'll be in the closet , which we 'll save for another day . " ' Another day ? "  | " Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , t stairs , and the dining room . " " Eddie ? " " Yes , Jackie , I 'm right here behind Robert . " " Please do n't let me fall in a hole . " " There are no drops at all , Jackie . Upstairs is all one level and is downstairs . Just keep sliding your foot along . Not even the stairs will surprise you if you slide your foot along . " Jackie had no idea of the planning that had gone on in the last three months which allowed Eddie to say this . They had cleared their home of all but the necessities and counted every path and stairway in order to teach Jackie to move around on her own . In Eddie 's and Robert 's minds she was here to stay , and the sooner she learned her way around , the better . Eddie had even gone so far as to remove all of her knickknacks and store them in boxes in the attic . ' When Jackie learned where each piece of furniture was , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , she would n't want to take another step . " You made it , " Robert cried and Eddie followed more slowly . " I 'll fall backward , " Jackie said , clutching at the railing . Robert put a hand on her back . " I 've got you . Now straight ahead is your room . Put your hand out and start moving . " " Oh , Robert , I do n't think I can . " He could hear the exhaustion in her voice and knew that this had to be the last trial for the day . " Just do this , Jackie , and I 'll help you with the rest . Hand out , and slide your feet . " He watched her carefully . " Now move your hand two inches to the left . Do you feel that ? That 's the doorway to your room . " Jackie felt her way all around , her hands smoothing the frame and wall and even walking a little bit inside . Robert came behind her and led her to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to it and settled himself beside her . She promptly burst into tears , the first since they 'd left Georgetown . Eddie sat on the other side of her and put her arms around her .  | I " Oh , Eddie , Eddie . How will I ever make it ? " " You did wonderfully , dear , " she consoled her . " I 'm so proud f you . In no time at all you 'll be all over the house and yard . " " Why , Eddie ? Why must I do this ? " " Because you need to take your life back , Jackie . You 've become an invalid , and Mother is too close to you to change it . Robert and I are going to help you , but you 're going to have to do the work . You 're going to have to be willing to get bruised and spill things , because I wo n't allow you to sit around and neither will Robert . Trust me , Jackie , you will thank us someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife exchanged a look over her head . They were both smiling and believed that it would n't be long before Jackie was smiling too . They would see to that . They would do everything in their power to help her reclaim some independence , if only she would make the effort . If they succeeded , they believed she would see far more in her world than she ever had with perfect vision .  | " You did not tell me she was a beauty . " Eddie smiled at Lena , their housekeeper and cook . " She is pretty , is n't she ? " Lena put a hand over her heart . " Carl will faint . " Eddie laughed . Lena was always so dramatic , and her son , Carl , had an eye for a pretty face . Lena thought Robert was the salt of the earth and had begged to work for him even when he could barely afford her . Robert 's bank had given Lena 's husband , Raymond , a loan , and as far as she was concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his blind sister-in-law only added to this adoration . " I must take her food now . " " No , Lena , " Eddie spoke , eyeing her sternly . " You will not wait on her or feel sorry for her . I was just up there . She had a great night 's sleep , and she 's coming down as soon as she brushes her hair . " " But she may have forgotten from yesterday . She may not know the way . This house is so big . " Eddie shook her head , and Lena relented . Robert had already left for the bank , and Eddie wanted to report to him at the end of the day that everything had gone well . If she started by babying Jackie , the day was going to be a disaster . " Eddie ? "  | The young wife heard her name from the other room , and her heart leapt with joy . She moved to the bottom of the stairs and found Jackie standing uncertainly . " Hi . You made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked sad . " I ca n't remember how many steps it is to the dining room table . " " Nineteen , " Eddie told her immediately . " Eddie , how do you know that so fast ? " Eddie slipped her arm in Jackie 's , not a comfortable position for the blind girl since she felt like she was in the lead . Eddie had done some reading and knew that the most comfortable position would be to have Jackie 's arm in hers , with her walking half a step ahead of Jackie . But right now her mind was n't on that . " We did a lot of planning before you arrived , " Eddie told her easily as they moved . " Oh . " Jackie 's voice was still flat , and she had no other questions . They walked in silence until Jackie was at her chair . " Have a seat , Jackie , " Eddie began . " To your right is Lena . She works for Robert and me . " " Oh ! " Jackie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sister . " Hello , Miss Jackie . " " Hello , " Jackie answered , but her mind was moving . She had heard rustling upstairs after Eddie had left her and now knew that must have been Lena as well . " Can you find everything there ? " Eddie wished to know after Lena had put a plate before her . Jackie nodded . In truth , she was n't too certain , but she was going to try . " Where is my fork ? " she finally had to ask . " I think ? " Eddie stayed in her place , but was helping her look . " Oh , yes . You pushed it under the plate . " " Oh , okay . I 've got it now . " Eddie looked up to see Lena watching from the doorway , tears in the older woman 's eyes . She swiftly averted her own so as not to join her .  | " What 's this ? " " Scrambled eggs , and to the other side are potatoes . Sausa on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coffee is on your right . " Jackie started to eat , and for a time they were quiet . The Boulder resident was the one to break the silence with a quest that Eddie would have said was the furthest thing from her m " Are you still as pretty as you were , Eddie ? " " Oh , my . " Eddie 's voice was exaggerated . " Much more so , " told her sister and was rewarded by the first small smile since had arrived in Boulder . It 's going to be all right , Jackie . You 'll see . After Eddie had silently said these words , she asked God to enable her to do all she could with this sister of hers , and to have a heart that was glad for the privilege . " Church ? " Jackie 's voice was horrified . " I ca n't go to church . " " I do n't know why not , " Eddie replied reasonably . " Lena has pressed your best dress , and I 'll get you up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hair . " " I could n't stand it , Eddie . I know people will stare . I just could n't stand it . " Her voice was going higher and higher . " Is there a problem ? " Robert 's voice came from the other side of the door . Eddie made sure that Jackie 's nightgown was in place and went to open it . " She 's panicked about going to church . " " I ca n't , Robert , " she spoke as she heard his steps entering the room . " And you 're not going to make me ! " Her hands were clenched so tightly at her side that her nails were biting into her skin . Robert came forward and without warning caught Jackie 's jaw in his hand . It was not harsh , nor was his voice cruel , but he was master over her and she knew it . " In this house we attend church on Sundays . What you get out of it is up to you , but we will be going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she whispered fearfully , her hands now flapping panic . " Please do n't make me . " Robert moved his hand to her shoulder in a tender gesture . ackie , we 're not here to humiliate you . Eddie will help you with ur clothing and hair , and you 'll look lovely . If people stare it will because we have such an attractive sister who 's come to live with Our church family will be delighted to meet you . " Jackie 's breathing was still coming hard and fast . " Jackie , " Robert said , his voice still gentle . " The first time will be the hardest . When the road dries a little more , you 'll be going shopping with Eddie and doing everything she does . I believe with all my heart that you can enjoy a wonderful life . " Jackie did not look convinced , but he finished with , " Get some sleep now ; tomorrow will be a big day . " She never did agree , but Robert meant to have his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the night  --  not something she usually did , but tonight Jackie needed it . They said nothing more on the subject , but when Eddie joined Robert in their bedroom , she shook her head . " I 'm not certain this is going to work . " Robert did n't comment but reached to unbutton the back of the dress Eddie was presenting to him . Both knew they would just have to wait and see . Jackie could see the church but not touch it or be heard . Clayton was walking down the aisle . There was a beautiful blonde woman on his arm , and as Jackie stared , the woman and Clayton went to stand before the preacher . He said some words that Jackie could n't make out and touched their heads , and then Jackie watched as they kissed . A bunch of little children ran out of nowhere , and Clayton gathered them all into his arms . His bride too . He looked so happy . Just as he left the church , he caught Jackie 's eye and winked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning with a jolt . She sat up and was still panting when the clock began chiming downstairs .  | She counted . Only 4:00 . Her chest was still heaving when she lay back down . It was a dream . Nothing but a dream . " Oh , Clay , " she said in the dark . " How will I go on ? How will I live like this ? If I thought you would n't stay out of pity , I might have written and explained , but I could n't take that chance . If you pitied me , I would die , and I ca n't see your eyes to know the truth . " Her chest rose on a huge sigh as the pain of it all gripped her again . She put a hand to her ribs and could feel each one . She knew her breasts were smaller too , shrunken . She could circle one wrist with the fingers from the other hand and overlap them by what felt like inches . She knew she looked like a skeleton . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good figure and appetite . She might have run to fat if she had n't been so busy all the time . But now , even though she spent most of her day sitting , she could n't seem to gain any weight . Well , not most of her day anymore . Eddie had had her so busy in the last few days that she did n't know which end was up . And her mother . She missed her mother so badly that she ached inside . She wanted to hear her voice and feel her hands . A sob broke the stillness of the room . How could you do this to me , God ? What did I do to deserve this ? Clay always talked of serving You , of us serving You together , but I do n't think he really knows who You are . He does n't know what You 're capable of doing . I was happy . I was good . Why , God ? Why me ? Jackie 's tears were drying up instead of growing stronger , but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had a thought that was n't for herself was when she 'd asked Eddie how she looked . Her world had shrunken to the size of a robin 's egg , and all thoughts were for Jackie , poor Jackie . It took some time , but she did fall back to sleep . She woke with a feeling of dread , and for a time she attributed it to her dream in the wee hours . Then she remembered the day and Robert 's hand on her jaw . They were going to force her to go to church .  | " Oh , Jackie , " Eddie 's voice came to her ear . " Travis is here . " " Hello , Jackie . " His voice , deep and kind , came from somewhere above her . She remembered him , of course , but had forgotten how tall he was -- even taller than Robert . " Hello . " Jackie greeted him quietly and continued to grip Eddie 's arm . The older girl was certain to have a bruise . She heard the two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Eddie was moving them forward . " Here 's our seat , " Eddie was saying . Jackie put a hand out to guide herself along the pew . The wood was smooth , like the banister at Robert and Eddie 's , and Jackie liked the feel of it . Someone moved beside her , and a moment later Robert spoke in a hushed tone . " Well , people are staring , just like you thought . " He watched her stiffen . " I think Carl , that 's Lena 's son , is never going to blink again . Jackie moved her head as though she had n't heard him right . ' And Tommy Walcott . He 's only 16 , but he looks like he wo n't hear a word of the sermon . " " Do n't tease me , Robert , " she finally managed , her voice just as low . " Jackie . " His voice was very serious . " The young men in this church are falling out of their seats looking at you . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm blind . " " On the contrary , they all know and have been praying for you for months . " " Good morning , everyone , " a cheerful voice sounded from the front , and the conversation was cut off . Jackie , who was beginning to remember voices , tried to place this one and failed . Not that it would have mattered . Even after the singing was over and the sermon began , she heard very little . She was still trying to sort out ' Robert 's words . It was inconceivable that anyone would find her even remotely attractive .  | " Hello , Jackie , " the familiar voice called from the edge of the huge living room . Jackie turned to face the owner . " Hello , Carl , " she spoke softly , wondering if she would ev get over the wonder of it . Carl had been to visit her every day for the last three weeks . He would wait until his mother was ready to go home in the late afternoon and then come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in telling Jackie that her son had never seen the need to escort her home before , but Jackie could tell from Lena voice that she was not at all upset . " How are you today ? " " I 'm fine , " Jackie answered automatically as she always did . " How are you ? " " Fine . " He said the words , and Jackie knew he was staring at her . She knew then , as she had before , that the attraction was purely ' physical . This was not hard to figure out , as she could n't have been a worse companion . She said little and never laughed or smiled . It was n't that she was trying not to , but she had so little interest in other people that nothing really struck her as amusing or worthy of her regard . In a way , she wanted to see Carl give up . She did not even know what he looked like because she had never asked . She had no intention of getting involved with anyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stare at her did nothing for her heart . " I am ready now , Carl . " Lena called from the next room . " All right . " As usual he sounded regretful . " Have a nice evening , Jackie . " " Thank you , Carl . You do the same . " " Goodbye . " " Goodbye . " Here again was part of the routine . She would hear him walk across the floor , but he always paused . Jackie learned that if she turned her head away when his back was to her , he would take one final look at her and leave , but if she was still facing him , he took it as an invitation to talk to her again . Tonight she had her head turned , just as she 'd done for the last two weeks . It was a relief to hear him move away and leave with his mother . " Would it hurt you to talk to him a little , Jackie ? " Eddie asked as she entered the room just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but it would him . I 'm not going to encourage him . " " Why not ? " " To what end , Eddie ? " Jackie sounded tired . " He 's content to sit and stare at me , which means there 's nothing deep about his at-tention . " Eddie could n't argue with her there . Carl did like pretty girls , and Jackie was not a very fascinating companion these days . However , he was a sweet boy and had a strong love for Christ . Eddie knew it would do little good to tell Jackie that he was shy around her and afraid of saying the wrong thing . Eddie was certain that if he found the courage he could bring her sister out . " How did you do on your mending ? " Eddie had come to lean over her . " I swear Jackie , " she said with a laugh in her voice . " I 'm just going to give you the dark colors . You must have pricked your finger . There 's blood all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I knew I 'd stabbed myself , but I sucked on my finger for a while and thought it had stopped . " She sighed deeply . " This is the blouse that goes with the navy skirt you gave me. "  | " How did you know which blouse it was ? " Eddie said incred-ulously . " It has a different feel to it , and see , " she remarked , shifting the garment around . " The lace around the collar is very soft . The other one is scratchy . " " Well , I 'll take it and work on it right now . If I ca n't get it out , Lena can . That woman 's a wonder . " " Eddie , " Jackie spoke when she began to move away . " You do n't think Lena has encouraged Carl , do you ? " " I would say not , Jackie . She must know how you feel . " Eddie did n't elaborate , but it was very clear to anyone with eyes that Jackie was not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Carl 's name would have brought color to her cheeks . Eddie walked away wondering what Clayton had said about the blindness . The older woman did n't have it in her heart to ask . Jackie did n't comment to Eddie when she left either . Eddie had said that Lena knew how she felt . Jackie thought that nothing could be further from the truth . No one knew how she felt . How could she possibly let someone fall for her ? It was like she had said to Lexa months ago now , how much fun would it be to lead a blind wife around for the rest of your life ? " No thank you , " was Jackie 's reply to that . She did n't know how long Robert 's and Eddie 's patience would hold out , but at least she did n't feel humiliated in front of them . In the midst of all these thoughts , Robert 's voice could be heard . He must have just come home from work . " Something smells good , " Jackie heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi , " he called as he moved toward her . " How was your day ? " he asked , dropping a kiss on her cheek . The same as usual . " " Meaning ? " Robert pressed her . " Well , I sat here , " Jackie recited in a dull voice . " I sewed a little . I sat some more . Carl came to stare at me . That 's about the end of it . " Robert told himself to be patient , but it was not easy . His wife 's sister had no interest in life at all . It was like her life had ended the  | same day her vision had . Was the blindness difficult ? Yes . Was it upsetting ? Undoubtedly . But it was not the end of the world . Did he wish it on himself ? Absolutely not , but if it happened he would see the need to carry on and do so . The fact that Jackie had not done this ; indeed , that she was willing to sit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought fast in order to keep his thoughts constructive . Growing angry with her was not going to do a bit of good . " I want you to help Eddie with the dishes tonight , Jackie , " he told her suddenly . " The dishes ? " she questioned , not having done them since she fell . " Yes . I think it makes sense if you wash and Eddie and I dry . That way you can stand in one place and just hand things to us . " Jackie 's mouth had gone very dry . That was her typical reaction every time Robert introduced her to something new . She did n't want to help in the house at all but knew better than to admit that . Robert would have given her a lecture . Indeed , Robert was watching her mutinous expression right now and felt pleased that she was restraining herself . " Come on , " he said conversationally . " Let 's head to the table . I think dinner is almost on . " Robert stood and went ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't walk across the room so easily . She never talked unless someone was leading her , for it took all her concentration to remember where she was . Lately she was in the habit of asking God when it would all be over , but the answer was so painful that she would only push it from her mind . Jackie collapsed into the buggy and put a hand to her head . Eddie knew she was completely spent but did n't comment . Jackie had been living in Boulder for a month now , and this was their first trip into town . The young woman had been terrified . They 'd gone to the bank , to the general store , had lunch at the hotel with Robert ,  | and even stopped at Pastor Henley 's house . Taking everything without complaint , Jackie had been very quiet the entire day , Eddie felt her trembling each time she took her arm . Now they were in the buggy and headed home , and Ed knew that Jackie would fall asleep early tonight . She was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her face and Eddie knew she was just barely holding on . Help her Lord . Give her strength . It wo n't be like this forever if only she 'll keep trying and committing herself to You . I ca n't do it for her Lord . Just show her the way . " I do n't want you to be such a stranger , " Robert told Travis that very afternoon , but the younger man only shook his head . " I ca n't do that to Jackie right now , Robert . I can see how hard it is for her , and my presence is only going to make things worse . I can tell that she thinks everyone is staring at her . " " Well , many of them do , " Robert admitted , " but it 's not in the pitying or negative way she imagines . She and Eddie came into town to shop today . We went to lunch . I could tell she was terrified , but Eddie plans to take her every week until she 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets used to it . " " I hope so , but now we 're off the subject . Why do n't you come for dinner tonight ? " Travis began to shake his head , but Robert put a hand up , his voice at its most persuasive . " It 's already after 4:30 , so there 's no need for you to go all the way home , and you do n't have to stay long after we 've eaten , but I know Eddie would like to see you . " ' All right , I 'll come . When are you going to head home ? " " Around 5:00 , but do n't wait for me . Go on to the house and keep Jackie company . She needs to get out of herself . " " All right . " The men stood . " By the way , how are things going at the ranch ? "  | " Well . Maybe I 'll have a chance to tell you about it tonight . " " All right . I 'll see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what color your eyes are , " Jackie admitted hyly . " Blue . Light blue . " Jackie nodded , a little amazed that she 'd been bold enough to ask , but Travis had a very calming effect on her . He 'd also kept Carl away . When the younger man had seen him , he had n't spoken to Jackie at all . " Do you wear a hat , Travis ? " " Yes . A black cowboy hat . " " Felt ? " " Yes . Here , " he lifted it off the seat beside him . " Feel it . " He pressed the hat into Jackie 's hands , and she studied it through her fingertips . It was large and soft and smelled faintly of leather . Her fingers traced the braided hat band and told her why her nose had picked up the leather smell . " What color is the band ? " " Black . Black on black . Not very exciting . " His voice was kind . " It 's so soft . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Try it on . You live in Boulder now , and you have to look the part . " A small smile pulled at the corners of Jackie 's mouth , and when he put the hat on her head , she asked , " How 's that ? " " Fine , " Travis told her , but a small spark of pain hit his chest . A seeing person would have moved it back . It nearly covered her eyes . " Robert just came in , " Eddie announced from the doorway . " Why do n't you come in and sit down at the table . " " Okay . May I offer you my arm , Jackie ? " " Sure . " She stood and waited for him to remove the hat . When the hat was back on the chair , he took her hand in his and drew it  | through his arm . Jackie was vaguely aware that his voice was now many inches over her head , and for some reason she shuddered . She worked to keep his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so clearly to her . She had to bite her lip to keep from crying . Clayton was the right size . Clayton was perfect . Forget it Jackie . Just put him from your mind . He would n't want you if he knew . So just stop . It was a relief to sit down and have Eddie tell her what was on her plate . It helped her to remember who she was : a blind girl with no chance of marriage . The sooner she accepted that , the better .  | Clayton looked out his living room window at the neat front yard and then to the schoolhouse beyond and felt a thrill run through him . His school . He was going to be Mr. Taggart . School was not scheduled to start until September , and this was only midJuly , but the board had had no problem with his arriving early and getting settled in . In fact , they were thrilled at his eagerness . And he was eager . Never had he dreamed that the schoolhouse would be so new or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that the first schoolteacher they 'd hired had been a married man with six children . They 'd built a house that would fit his needs . Clayton knew he would never fill these rooms with a wife and children , but he would still do everything in his power to make it a home . It was very exciting to him that his family could come and visit anytime they wanted , and he would have no problem putting them up indefinitely . Clayton reached for the list in his front pocket . He 'd written out the things he would need . He was going to have to be careful until his regular paychecks started . Although it would have been cheaper to remain at his grandmother 's , once he 'd graduated and been accepted as a teacher , he could n't stand to stay in Denver . He let himself out the front door and moved around back to the stable behind the house . Inside was the horse his parents had given him the funds to purchase . The man at the livery had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Clayton had found her a gentle old mare.  | He saddled her and moved her to the front of the house to pull himself onto her back . From the saddle he took another long look at the schoolhouse . A moment later he turned and started Sally toward town , his heart thanking God for all that had come to pass . " And do n't let me forget the salt . " " But you have the list , Eddie , " Jackie told her . " If it 's on your list , how can you forget it ? " " Oh , right . Well , anyway , head to the buggy ; Jackie . It 's out front . " One , two , three , four , five , six , seven  --  the count was immediately on in her mind . From the bottom of the stairs , to the front door , now across the porch . There was the first step . Eleven down , moving carefully . It was the same routine . Jackie told herself that someday she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only add bruises if she tried it another way . " Okay . " Eddie sounded breathless as she climbed aboard . " Eddie , what are you so upset about ? " " I 'm not upset , " came the genuine reply . " I just think I should have eaten a little more breakfast , and now I do n't feel I have time . " " What 's our hurry ? " Eddie came to a complete stop , the reins in her hand . " Well , come to think of it , there is n't one . " She began to chuckle , but other than a slight smile , Jackie did n't join her . She was n't angry , but nothing ever struck her as funny these days . " Well , I 'll eat a big lunch , " Eddie said . " Shall we go to the ho-tel ? " " That 's fine , " Jackie replied apathetically . As usual Eddie prayed for strength . She thanked God for how well Jackie was doing . She was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest was completely disheartening to her sister . The two women made the ride into town in near silence and started their errands at the bank . They were there longer than they expected to be , and because Eddie  | claimed she was starving , they ate next . The general store was the last stop . Jackie was finally comfortable there . She now understood the lay of the things and took a slight interest . The bolts of fabric were all down one wall , but sewing notions were in the third aisle . " Did you put lace on your list , Eddie ? " " Lace ? " " Yes . Did n't you say I 'd torn some on my blouse and it would have to be replaced ? " " Oh , you 're right . Let 's go look . " It was after they 'd stopped and Eddie had handed some lace to Jackie that she spotted him . Nothing could have prepared her for the sight of Clayton Taggart . Looking like a man in a dream , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was feeling , and for the moment she required no assistance from her sister . Eddie could n't utter a word . She watched Clayton approach , his eyes fastened on Jackie . She also watched and knew that he was just finding out the truth . He had snapped out of his earlier trance and now wore a look of defiant protection . Eddie assumed it was for his own heart , but Jackie 's movements changed his face yet again . Thankful that no one else was in the aisle , Eddie stood completely frozen as Clayton stepped up to within two feet of them . He stared at Jackie , and Jackie stared right through him . " I think this one feels nice , Eddie . What does it look like ? " The sounds of the store moved in and out of Jackie 's mind , but nothing else . " Eddie , " she said uncertainly . " Did you leave me , Eddie ? " The slightly alarmed tone in her voice got through . " No , no , " Eddie assured her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know where my head is today . " " Eddie , is something wrong ? " Her sister 's voice frightened her . " No , of course not . Now which one did you like ? " " This one . " " Oh , yes . " Eddie was amazed at how normal she sounded with Clayton at her elbow " This is very simple but elegant . It has large  | holes to the bottom , but at the top they 're very tiny . Can you tell what I mean ? " " Yes . Is it very much ? " " I do n't think so . " In truth , she had n't even looked . " Why do n't we take some up to be measured . What would you say , a yard ? " " That should do it . " Eddie forced herself to concentrate on her sister and just get home . She moved Jackie on her way without ever looking at Clayton . They went to the front and paid for their purchases , Eddie needing three tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make their way toward the buggy . Eddie could n't stand it anymore . She looked back at the front of the store to see that Clayton had come to the door to watch them . He looked utterly devastated . Eddie thought fast . " Jackie , will you take the reins a moment ? I need to run back for something . " " Oh , Eddie , what if the horse moves ? " " Here , " she took the reins back . " I 'll tie the lines back again , and he 'll just sit here . " " All right . Will you be long ? " No . Just sit tight . " She climbed down from the buggy with the help of a passing gentleman and moved back to where Clayton stood transfixed . He did n't look at her at first . His eyes were still glued to Jackie . When he did look at Eddie , his gaze was tortured . " When , Eddie ? " He could barely manage the words . " Months ago . Last September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized . She stopped writing because of the blindness . There is no other man . His mind raced on . " Is it permanent ? " he asked , his eyes drilling into Eddie 's . She could only nod . It was awful . Experiencing the news with Clayton was almost as bad as learning about it all over again for herself . " I 've got to speak to her . " Eddie shook her head .  | " Tag , " she said in a low voice , " please wait . Come to the house tonight . Come late when Jackie will be in bed . Robert and I will wait up for you . " He opened his mouth to protest , but Eddie shook her head . " It wo n't work , Tag , not like this on the streets of town . She would n't be able to deal with the surprise , and I wo n't do that to her . Please come tonight , " she pleaded , praying that Clayton would understand . Clayton looked once again at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little way up the street . He had to force his eyes away . " What time ? " " After nine . Do you know where we live ? " " I 'll find it . " With that Eddie turned and moved away . She forced herself to respond normally to her sister , but it was an effort . She was glad that Jackie wanted to sew that afternoon . Had she wanted anything more demanding , Eddie would not have survived . Robert took one look at his wife 's face and knew that her day had been rough . He also knew that she did n't want to talk about it in Jackie 's presence . Her voice was just a little too cheerful as they ate and did the dishes , so as soon as Jackie went into the other room , Robert speared her with his eyes . Eddie would n't look at him . She was not afraid , but she knew she was going to cry and that Jackie would hear her . " Talk to me , Eddie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Later . " " No . If you 're this upset , I need to know what 's going on . " Eddie took a deep breath and shook her head . Robert gently took her arm and moved her out the back door . It was private out on the rear porch , and Robert could still hear if Jackie called to them  | " If you do n't tell me what 's going on , I 'll be forced to ask Jackie directly . What has she done ? " Eddie shook her head , and could no longer hold the tears . " Clayton Taggart is here , " she whispered . Robert looked thunderstruck . " You saw him ? " " And talked to him . " He let this sink in for a moment , and then asked , " What did Jackie say ? " More tears choked her voice for a moment . " She does n't know . He wanted to talk to her , but I discouraged him . He 's coming by later , after she 's retired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him . Why is he here , Robert ? " " Maybe he wanted to see her and tell her how sorry he was about the accident . " Again Eddie shook her head . " He did n't know . When he saw her he was so shocked he could barely function . Why is he here ? " Light dawned very swiftly . " You never wrote to him about the accident , did you ? " " No , and I think my family has lost all touch with his . " " The school . " " What ? " Robert took her hands in his . " I 'll bet he 's been hired on to teach school . I 'm not involved , of course , but I know the board was looking for a new teacher . " " Oh , Robert , what does this all mean ? " He now took her in his arms . " I do n't know exactly , but if he 's graduated and is now able to teach , then he might be the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice preceded her as she moved slowly into the kitchen , something clutched in her hand . " Are you in the pantry , Eddie ? " " No , " Robert answered and stood back so his wife could enter . " We were just on the back porch . " " Oh . Well , I ca n't get this knot out of my thread . Will you help me ? "  | " Sure , " Robert offered , giving Eddie a chance to compose herself . " I 'll have to remove the needle , I think . " Jackie stood silently and waited . She heard Eddie move then and spoke to her . " Is that you , Eddie ? " " Yes . " " I think this is my last one . I do n't know what I 'm going to do tomorrow with nothing to sew or mend . " Robert 's eyes met Eddie 's for just an instant . " We 'll think of something , " Eddie assured her . The thread now adjusted and the needle back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't often that they led her around or waited on her , but Eddie felt a desperate need to touch her sister . She did n't know how she could act normally until Jackie went to bed and Clayton arrived , but Robert came to the rescue . He 'd picked up a letter from Morgan when he left the bank . The women sat across the living room from him while he read . Dear Robert , Ed , and Jack , business is booming and it seems that new strikes are found almost daily . As usual , we sell more mining supplies than food . One of the mine owners stopped his team of mules in front of the store recently and left a huge mess for me to clean , but as I said , business is good . New houses are being built as well , and the latest is a bright yellow one almost next door to us . A young couple has moved into Uncle Mitch 's apartment . They have a small baby , and your mother frets that the little guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around stairs ; she 's starting to sound like a grandmother . We miss you , Jack , very much , but are thrilled you 're getting out . I would enjoy seeing the general store there in Boulder . It never hurts to check out the competition . Miss Bradley has left us , but the new schoolteacher has already been installed . A man this time , and he has two boys and a girl who match the  | ages of Sam , Dan , and Alex . They 've gotten to know each other some , and your mother has met his wife at church . His name escapes me right now , but I 'll think oif it later . Your mother and Ora are making a quilt together , and she is there now because Ora has a large quilting frame . I 'm supposed to be helping Sam with her math , but she fell asleep and I carried her to bed . Oh , I think I hear your mother coming in now . I 'll close and let her write more to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the letter aside and smiled at his wife . Jackie did not comment , and not long after she took herself upstairs for the night . Clayton had never experienced anything like this . His heart felt as if it had been torn in two . One half rejoiced that Jackie was not in love with someone else , but the other half could hardly bear the pains of what had happened to her . He was n't angry ; indeed , he thought : he understood . If it had been him , would he have assumed that Jackie wanted a blind husband ? The question took some real soul-searching . His stomach growled as the house came into view . He had n't wanted anything to eat after he talked to Eddie , and even now his stomach felt a mite queasy . Not with revulsion but with pain . He was at the house now . Clayton tied Sally 's lead to a bush and climbed the front-porch stairs to the door . Darkness was falling fast , butt he could see his way . He knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see her ? Eddie said she would be in bed , but Clayton hoped she would be wrong . Eddie opened the door , and without words she stepped back and let him enter . A large fireplace sat against the right wall of the entryway and to the left was the double-doorway to the living room .  | " I 'll take your hat , Clay . " Eddie spoke softly , bringing Clay-ton 's eyes to hers just briefly . If he was here out of pity for her sister , she 'd tell him to leave . Eddie herself did n't know where this fierce , protective attitude came from , but Clayton could see that his hostess was ill-at-ease . " Robert is in the study . If you 'll just ? " Eddie stopped , and her head twisted around . Slowly descending the stairs was Jackie . She was moving with deliberate care , her hand on the railing . Eddie shot a swift glance at Clayton , but he had eyes for Jackie alone . Eddie nearly panicked , thinking he would speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl when she missed the last step and fell into a heap . Clayton moved so quickly to help her that Eddie had to step in front of him , arms outstretched . She spoke swiftly to cover the noise . " Are you all right , Jackie ? " " Yes . " She sounded more angry than hurt . " Do you want some help ? " " No . " Her answer was clipped . A moment of silence passed , and Jackie turned her head slightly . " Are you alone , Eddie ? " " No . " Again she tried to sound normal . " Male or female ? " " Male . " ' Are my legs covered ? " " Yes . " Jackie came to her feet then , feeling her way carefully . Eddie said , " I thought you were going to bed . " " I am , but I forgot my water glass . " " I 'll get it for you . " Eddie moved off quickly , but not before she gave Clayton a look that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back very swiftly , an empty glass in her hand . " Here you go . "  | " Thanks , Eddie . " " Good-night , Jackie . " " Good-night . " Once again they watched , only this time Jackie eventually moved from view . The look on Clayton 's face broke Eddie 's heart . With nothing but compassion she took his arm and led him to the study .  | Clayton was trembling so badly by the time he reached the spacious study that he could barely walk . Robert immediately offered him a chair . He had thought it would help . He had thought if he could just see her he would feel better , but the sight of Jackie sitting in a heap was almost more than he could bear . If he 'd been able to go to her , he might have been all right , but as it was , he felt as helpless as she must feel all the time . Tears gathered in his eyes . He might have cried earlier in the day , but he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child , much the way he 'd done when Jackie wrote and said she 'd found someone new . At last he looked up to see his hosts watching him . Had only a few moments passed ? They looked kind , and he felt free to speak . " My mother commented to me several times that Addy had stopped writing her . It was the same for Danny 's correspondence with Milly . I never once suspected that Jackie 's letter might not be true . " " She wrote to you ? " Eddie asked . " You knew ? " " No , I do n't think she did write . She must have had someone else . " " But you did know about the blindness ? " Robert asked . Clayton shook his head . He knew he was making very little  | sense . " A letter came to me saying she 'd met someone else and that she never wanted to hear from me or see me again . " Robert and Eddie both nodded . It was sad that Jackie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was surprised . Eddie thought about how closely Lexa 's handwriting resembled Jackie 's . It was not hard to figure out . " How long has it been ? " Clayton now asked . " The date was late September , so that would be almost ten months , " Eddie responded . " How did it happen ? " " She fell from a ladder in the back room of the store . She landed flat on her back . The doctor said it was the blow to the back of the head that did the damage . " ' And she 'll never see again ? " " Never , " Robert told him quietly . They both watched as Clayton was overcome . He put his face in his hands and cried . " Is she in pain now ? " Clayton managed , tears still streaming down his face . " No , " Robert assured him . " They said she might have headaches beyond the first few weeks , and that would have been a good sign because it might mean that things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pain means that it 's permanent . " Clayton nodded . He was feeling more in control now , and a thousand questions raced through his mind . Before he could utter one of them , however , Robert had some of his own . " I 'm sorry you had to find out this way , Clay , but may I ask what brings you to Boulder ? " Clayton used his handkerchief and took a deep breath . " I 've been hired to teach here at the school . " Robert nodded . " Congratulations . I know it 's what you 've wanted for a long time . " " Yes . " Clayton agreed with him but did not sound overjoyed . " You 're here rather early for school , Clay . Is there a reason for that ? "  | " I just wanted to get settled in . " He sounded almost apolo-getic . " So you 're not actually working until this fall ? " " That 's correct . " Robert shot a glance at his wife , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance and prayed that she would not be upset . " Jackie did n't retire until right before you came , Clay , so Eddie and I have n't even had a chance to talk about this , but I wonder if I could hire you for the summer and even into the school year . Both other occupants of the room stared at him , and Robert tried to tell Eddie with his eyes to trust him . " Hire me to do what ? " " Teach Jackie . " Eddie came to her feet , and Robert stood as well . " It 's all right , Eddie , " he said gently . " No , it 's not , Robert , " Eddie told him , completely forgetting Clayton 's presence . " We ca n't do this to her . She was in love with him , and she wo n't be able to stand it . She 'll be humiliated , having him here but not having his love anymore . " Clayton interrupted with a statement that completely snagged Eddie 's attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth in his eyes . She had to ask him , " What do you intend to do about it ? " " For starters , " he replied , " I 'll take up Robert 's offer to teach your sister . " He turned back to Robert . " When do you want me to start ? " " As soon as you can come . " Clayton 's eyes searched the room but did n't really focus . " They do n't teach you this at school , " he nearly murmured to himself . " I mean , they assume all your students will have vision , but I think I can work this out . Can you give me a week ? "  | " Yes . In fact , just do what you can and get back to me . I see now that I should n't have surprised Eddie . In a week , you 'll know if you can do it , and Eddie and I will either be in one accord on this or we 'll forget the whole thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's not you , Tag , " Eddie said , finding her voice . " I know , Eddie , " he replied kindly . " She 's just been through so much and I know how upset she 'll be if Robert suggests this . " " It wo n't be any party for me , either , " he said quietly . Eddie had to admit that she had n't thought of his feelings . " We 'll all pray about this , " Robert said , " and see if we can come to an agreement . " " What if Jackie says no , " Clayton wanted to know . Robert shook his head . " If Eddie and I decide this is the best for her , she wo n't be given a choice . " Clayton stared at him . " The Jackie I know would n't put up with that . " Robert shook his head a bit sadly . " She 's not the same girl , Clay  --  that might be the first thing you should know . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely she 'll fight you every step of the way . " " But you would want me to maintain control , just like in a classroom . " " Yes . " " No . " Husband and wife said the words in unison and then looked at each other . " If he is n't firm enough with her , Eddie , she 'll never respond . " " I ca n't see her crushed , Robert . No matter what , I ca n't see her crushed . " Tears had come to her eyes , and Robert reached for her hand . He knew it upset her to have Clayton see them . " I would n't do that , Eddie , " Clayton said without heat . " I 'm not that kind of teacher . I mean , there 's going to be an adjustment time , that 's a given , but I have no plans to humiliate any of my  | students , and that includes Jackie . However , I know very well what she 's capable of and how intelligent she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie suddenly felt more tired than she 'd ever been in her life , and it must have shown on her face because Clayton made a move to leave . He bade Eddie goodbye , and Robert saw him to the door . Robert returned to put the lights out in the study and found Eddie sitting trancelike in a chair . He assumed she 'd have gone up the back stairway to their room . She looked utterly drained . " Eddie , if it 's going to upset you this much , we 'll drop the whole idea . " " I 'm just so tired . " She began to cry . " I ca n't even think straight right now . " Robert lifted her to her feet and then into his arms . He forgot about the lights and simply carried her up the stairs . Eddie cried the whole time he was getting her ready for bed and even after her head lay on the pillow . " Just go to sleep . " " But you 'll be gone in the morning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll make some time , " he promised her , really worried at how this had upset her . " I 'm sorry I did n't talk to you first , " he told her , but she was already gone . Her breathing was a bit shuddery , but she was asleep . He told himself he would make things right in the morning . But in the morning , Eddie was of an entirely different mind . She woke early and prayed for almost an hour . She then woke Robert and told him her heart . " I think Tag should come . " " What changed your mind ? " " I was n't really against it , Robert . I just could n't put any more thought to it last night . " " But what of your fears ? They might have some validity . " " No , they do n't ; I know that now . Clay would not hurt her , and if he was n't firm with her , she 'd have him waiting on her hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show us a new direction ,  | and I ca n't help but believe this is His answer . " Eddie lay in the crook of her husband 's arm . " When should I tell her ? " " I 'll tell her , " Robert said . " You can be there if you like . I 'll probably wait until early next week , after I 've talked to Clay . " ' All right . Is there some reason ? " Eddie rose to look into his face . " To wait ? " " Yes . " " Only to make sure that Clay understands what she 's going to be like , and to make sure he still wants the job . " " Maybe she 'll surprise us , " Eddie offered , but Robert looked skeptical . His face made Eddie doubt as well , and unfortunately , Robert was correct . " I know I missed a year , " Jackie argued for the fifth time , " but it ca n't be all that important . What does it matter now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital of Rhode Island ? " There was a bitter tone to her voice that Robert chose to ignore . " You need to gain more interest in the things around you , Jackie , " he repeated . " This is one way to do it . I 've even found you a teacher . " This gained Jackie 's immediate attention . She sat very still , and a feeling of dread stole over her . She was not going to be able to talk her way out of this if he had already talked to a teacher . " Who is it ? " she asked in a resigned voice . Robert glanced quickly at Eddie before saying , " Clayton Tag-gart . " Jackie rose from the settee as though on strings , the color draining from her face . " You 're lying . Clayton is in Denver . " " He has been hired to teach school here in Boulder , and I just spoke with him yesterday . He 's willing to come every day and tutor you until school begins . After September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . " Jackie said the word softly and then with more strength . " No , I wo n't do it ! You 've had your way about everything . Well , you can forget this , Robert Langley . I wo n't be taught by Clay Taggart , and that 's the end of it ! " Robert had known she was going to be upset , but he had n't been prepared for this furious , red-in-the-face reaction . She was not just beside herself ; she was hysterical with panic . " I want to go home , " she now began . " I want to go to Georgetown . Eddie , " she screamed . " Eddie , do n't let him do this to me . " Robert was on her in a moment , putting his arms gently around her and talking in a calm voice , but Jackie would have none of it . She cried and pushed against him , even lashing out with her feet and screaming Eddie 's name again and again . Robert forced her back onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the seat , his words got through . " It 's all right , Jackie ; it 's all right . I know it 's a shock , but it 's going to be all right . " " Please do n't make me , Robert , " she whimpered when she could barely move an inch . Robert had to wall up his heart to make it . He knew this was best , but it was breaking his heart to see her so upset . " It 's going to be all right , " he said with a catch in his voice . " You 'll find out that he 's still the same Clay , and his coming will give you something to look forward to . I know he 's going to be a very good teacher . " Jackie turned her face into his coatfront and sobbed . " I ca n't stand the pity . I know he 's just coming because he feels sorry for me . I ca n't stand it . I wrote and told him I was in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clay . " " Shhh , " he comforted . Looking over at his sobbing wife , he wished he could hold them both . He did n't regret this action for a moment , but he did hate to see his wife and sister-in-law in pain . " Jackie . " Eddie surprised Robert by speaking up . " I hate to see you this upset . Please do n't cry . " The younger girl took a few great gulping breaths and worked hard to control herself .  | " I just ca n't face him , " she said so softly that they almost missed it . " He 's going to know I lied , and after all we 've been to each other , I just do n't .... " The words trailed off , but she no longer cried . Her unseeing eyes stared sightlessly ahead of her as if she had n't a friend in the world . Robert broke the silence . " I think you will find that Clay is every inch a professional . Whatever there was in the past is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink in for a time . " I 'm not saying it 's going to be easy , Jackie , " Robert continued in a very gentle tone , " but then you 've had to learn in the last ten months that your life will never be easy again . Now , you can decide how you want it . You can work with Clay or fight him , but he will be here . " If Jackie had felt hopeless before , she now felt beyond despair . However , she did not feel helpless . For the first time since the accident , she told herself she was not going to ask for assistance or do anything that might make it look like she needed help . Clayton Taggart was not going to come and find some pitiful , waning creature in need of special care . She would do all he asked of her and more . She would work so hard that he would n't even need to stay the whole year . Exactly how she was going to accomplish this she did n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clayton that she 'd found someone new . It was n't true , but it might as well have been : She was never going to let him know that she was still in love with him .  | Clayton 's heart pounded as he lifted the crate up onto his kitchen table and pried open the lid . The box was from his mother , but he knew she could n't have received his letter . Even before he 'd remembered the books , he 'd told Robert he would take the job . Other than rote memorization , he did n't have a clue as to how to teach Jackie , but he was not going to let this opportunity pass . The lid was off now , and Clayton moved aside old newspapers and straw . Again he felt his breath quicken . She 'd sent his books ? all of them ! It had to be the Lord . He dug deeply into the box , his heart sinking a little . Then he saw them . Two volumes , one rather thick and one quite small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusted it off : Braille : Methods and Management . The other volume was a book of poetry written in Braille . They had been in his grandmother 's library , and she had given them to him . He had never even looked at them . They 'd been taking up space on his lower shelf for months , and he was n't even certain if he still had them . He now turned to the first page of the manual , his hand shaking . He read that a young French lad by the name of Louis Braille , who had gone blind at age three , developed a system in 1828 that was based on a six-dot configuration . Clayton had heard of this method  --  reading by following raised marks on paper  --  but he had never studied or given much thought to it . Now he read in amazement that there were 63 possible characters in the Braille system .  | With those dot arrangements a person could make the alphabet , punctuation marks , numbers , and some small words . For the next three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff and the hand holding the book cramped , but he read on . He did n't know if he could learn enough in two days , but he was going to give it a try . If it did n't work , he would tell Jackie that they would be learning together . With the instruction book open under his left hand and the poetry book open in his right , Clayton tried to read with his fingers . It took another hour to learn even a few words , but he was getting it . He nearly shouted for joy when he turned to the back of the manual and found a long list of practice words . Thank You , Lord . I know You 've made this possible . Please help me to help her . You know that my heart has been involved in the past , but I do n't ask this for myself . I ask for Jackie . Please help her to understand . Make me the teacher You would have me to be , patient and kind . Clayton prayed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did little else in the next 48 hours but sleep , study , and pray . When Thursday morning arrived , he knew he was as ready as he was going to be , and his heart thudded with a mixture of joy and apprehension , all the time telling himself to watch his expectations . He looked at the watch in his pocket constantly and nearly forgot to shave , but it was finally time to go . Jackie pressed her damp palms deep into the folds of her dress and told herself she was not going to use the necessity again . Her stomach had been in knots ever since she 'd awakened and realized that this was the day Clayton was scheduled to arrive . How would it feel ? How would it be to hear his voice but never see his wonderful face again ? Jackie 's heart thundered at the very thought . Her breathing came fast , and she nearly jumped from her skin when Eddie spoke to her from across the table . " I 'm sorry to startle you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been all morning . " Please try to eat something , Jackie . "  | " I 'm just not hungry . I think if I eat , I 'll be sick to my stomach . " Eddie sighed . It was remarkable how much weight Jackie could drop in a few days . For a while she had started to fill out a little , but now she was back to her cadaverous state . Eddie was feeling sick just thinking about what Jackie was going through . " Just some toast , " Eddie coaxed , but Jackie shook her head . The young wife wondered if Robert would have held to his resolve if he could see Jackie now . It was n't that Eddie disagreed with the schooling decision ; it was just that she felt too emotionally involved to be the one to enforce this . Not that she expected Jackie to fight it ; indeed , a frightening transformation had come over her sister since Robert had made his announcement . The younger girl looked hard now , implacable , and that was something Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ofttimes apathetic Jackie was gone . This Jackie was defensive and angry . Eddie simply did n't know what to think . " I think I 'll wait in my room , " Jackie suddenly said and rose . ' Are you sure ? I thought you would want to be in the study before Clayton arrives . " " The study ? We 're going to be in there ? " " Yes . Robert thought it would give you the most privacy . " Jackie nearly fainted on the spot . She had assumed they would be in the living room . She did n't know the study like she did the other rooms in the house . She was sure to bump things if she tried to move around . There was only one answer . " I will go to the study now , Eddie . Please give me some warning before he walks in the door . " " I will , " Eddie promised , but stared after her in confusion . ' What was the problem with the study ? Thankfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jackie immediately and helped her find her way around . When the bell sounded at the front door , signaling Clayton 's arrival , she left Jackie sitting at the inlaid mahogany writing table that Robert had set up for just that purpose .  | Clayton 's heart was a mixture of emotions as he stood and waited for the door of the Langley home to open . In some ways he was glad that Jackie would n't be able to read his face , but her blindness was still so shocking to him that he was having trouble taking it in . She appeared to be so accepting . First in the buggy , then when she waited for her glass of water , and then again at church , sitting silently through the whole morning , not even aware that he was in the room . Was she really so resigned ? Clayton somehow doubted it . The door opened amidst the questioning of his mind . " Hello , Tag , " Eddie greeted him warmly , but the young man noticed a flush to her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small laugh . " Just a little tense . Jackie wants me to warn her before I let you in the study . In truth , I think she 's scared out of her wits . " " Understandable . " His voice was wonderfully kind . " I 'm worse than a stranger . It 's embarrassing because of our past , and at the same time she does n't know me well enough anymore to really judge what I 'll be like . " " Yes , I see what you mean . I 'll go now and give her a moment to get used to the idea that you 've arrived . " Eddie found Jackie on the sofa . She sat up rather tensely and looked toward her sister . " He 's here , Jackie . " Jackie came to her feet . " Do I look all right ? " Her voice was low , and her hands smoothed down the skirt of her light gray dress . It was a perfect foil for Robert 's dark burgundy office . Jackie 's question was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You look beautiful , " she told her truthfully . It was amazing that the blindness had done nothing to mar the loveliness of Jackie 's eyes or face . Her mouth was no longer given to smiling , but she was still gorgeous . " I 'll send him in . " By the time Clayton arrived , Jackie was back in control . Sitting had seemed so awkward , so she had remained on her feet and forced herself not to appear tense when she heard his footsteps at the door .  | " Hello , Jackie . " " Clayton ? " He sounded so different . Some of her confidence left her . " Yes , it 's me . Are you ready to begin ? " " Yes , " she answered without thinking . " Okay . Why do n't you come to the desk here . " Clayton came forward to take her arm . " I have some books to show ? " " I can do it , " she snapped at him . Clayton dropped her arm and swiftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly . " I 'm sorry . How would you like to handle this ? Shall I assume you 'll ask for help if you need it ? " " Yes , " Jackie replied coldly , even as she told herself she would never ask him for anything . Clayton waited until she was seated before he spoke , and in that moment he saw that she had n't needed his help . She went directly to the table and sat down at the chair . Her actions reminded him of the calm way she 'd come down the stairs the week before . It would have been nice if they could have engaged in some small talk , but Jackie 's expression did not welcome it . Clayton felt he had no choice but to begin . " I 'm putting a book in front of you , Jackie . It 's opened to the middle , and I 'd just like you to touch the pages for a moment . " Clayton watched as she obeyed , and then studied her face as her brow furrowed in concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Braille ? " " Yes , it 's a French name , and along with being a technique by which a blind person can read , it 's also the name of the method 's creator . " Clayton nearly stumbled on the word " blind " but managed it . Other than a slight lift in Jackie 's chin , she had no reaction . " As you can feel , it 's a series of dots or small bumps , if you will . I 'm going to teach you to read and write with this method . " Jackie 's mouth went dry . She 'd have told Robert or Eddie no and without discussion that she could n't possibly learn such a thing , but not Clayton  --  never him . ' All right . " Again the chin lifted
