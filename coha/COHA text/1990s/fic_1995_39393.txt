 --  I lived the life of a cat until I was nineteen , Vicki said . <p> We were all sitting in a booth at the Dream Cafe telling stories about our first lovers . She 'd just been listening up until now , and it was her turn . We knew she had lots to tell . She had long , straight chestnut hair and strong bones . Men turned their heads to look at her . <p>  --  Are you changing the subject ? Laurie asked . <p> Vicki shook her head . I was just trying to remember what it was like before sex , she said . It was like being a cat . <p>  --  A spayed cat , somebody laughed . <p>  --  Yes , a house cat , Vicki said . Curled up most of the time . Stretching . <p> Looking out windows . Eating muffins . <p>  --  Muffins <p>  --  Why not muffins ? Olivia said . My cat used to love powdered-sugar doughnuts . <p> Martha wiped the foam of beer off her upper lip . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  loved to lick the olives in martinis . He 'd sit there waiting until she was done with her drink . He liked pretzels , too . <p>  --  Dirt-Boy ? That was the name of your mother 's cat Vicki asked . <p>  --  Yeah , his nickname . He liked to roll in the dirt . <p>  --  My mother 's cat was called Gingernut , Vicki said . <p>  --  We 're getting way , way off the subject . Laurie looked at Vicki . Go on . <p>  --  Well , I was a cat and then I was n't . I remember looking in the bathroom mirror . I 'd turned into a big , tall girl with breasts , and hips , and a scary mouth that wanted to be kissed all the time . <p> A fork clattered to the floor at another booth , and we all turned to watch a guy with grizzled hair reach down to pick it up . We 'd seen him around before , but did n't know his name . <p> The Dream Cafe was divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family part , where minors were allowed . If we sat there , we drank cappuccino . Tonight we were in the smoky bar section , and we were all drinking drafts . At night they showed foreign movies in the back room , and if we did n't feel like talking much we 'd gather back there , where you could sip something strong if you liked , or not even drink at all . <p>  --  How did it happen ? Laurie leaned forward . She had short dark hair and rimless glasses . She was a law student , and felt an obligation to keep things focused . <p> Vicki stretched back in her chair , half-closing her eyes . <p>  --  I think I could have gone on forever without an interior life if I had n't fallen in love with a clown . She laughed a little ruefully , and took a sip of her beer . You know , I wish I were still a cat . <p>  --  But you 're not , Laurie said . Go on . And do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p>  --  Sort of both , Vicki said . <p> She squeezed her eyes together tightly , then opened them wide . Now they seemed glazed and far away , as if they were no longer reflecting the four of us sitting around her . We had vanished . <p> She began . <p>  --  I 've always hated clowns . I ca n't explain why . My older brother , Johnny , hated them too , and he was always teasing me . We had this little game that got more and more out of hand over the years . One Christmas when I was twelve and he was seventeen , I opened a package from him and there was this clown doll with orange hair . A few days later , I snuck the clown doll into his bed , so he 'd find it when he turned back the covers . Not long afterwards the clown doll showed up again in my bed with a love sonnet Scotch-taped to its tummy . Then I sent Johnny a clown birthday card ; about a month later I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to school . <p>  --  This sort of thing went on for years , even after he 'd moved out to his own apartment . It 's amazing how many clown products there are . <p> Johnny and I found them all , and gave them to each other on every possible occasion . Clown bubble bath , clown bubble gum , clown coffee mugs , wind-up clowns , clown barrettes , books about clowns , inflatable clowns  --  you name it . And then the other half of the game was to hide the horrible clown thing in the other 's place , which was easier for Johnny , because I still lived at home and he could stop by when I was n't there . It was a lot harder for me to find excuses to go over to his apartment . Once I managed to get the inflatable clown into the driver 's seat of his car when he was warming it up outside on a cold night . That was one of my biggest triumphs . <p>  --  After I graduated from high school , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends threw a nineteenth birthday party for me . She invited a bunch of our old friends who were back home for Christmas break . She also invited Johnny , because she had a crush on him , but he refused when he heard it was going to be all girls . <p>  --  Of course I knew I was going to get a clown gift from Johnny . It was just a matter of what , and when . But I thought I was pretty safe at the party . All the presents seemed to be from my friends , though of course Johnny might have talked one of them into wrapping something up for him as a joke . But at least the cake was covered with blue and pink roses . One year I 'd had to cut slices out of a frosted clown face . <p>  --  Around nine o'clock , just as I was opening the last present , a big oversized T-shirt with a cat on the front  --  everyone knew I was crazy about cats  --  the doorbell rang . <p>  --  Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us heard a squeal , than peals of laughter . <p>  --  A huge , live clown walked into the room . <p> Vicki paused . The waitress was hovering over us . She was new at the Dream Cafe , and Vicki cleared her throat self-consciously . <p>  --  Anything else here ? the waitress asked . She had a soft , educated voice . A long braid of dark hair fell down her back . She wore a lot of mascara and her lips were brightly painted . Her name tag said " Chloe . " <p>  --  Another draft , Martha said . <p>  --  Make that two , Olivia added . Can you bring us some chips and cheese dip , too , please ? <p> The new waitress moved off . Olivia was looking at her critically . <p>  --  Did you see those suede heels ? She 's not going to last long waitressing in those . <p>  --  She looks sad , Martha said . Do n't you think so ? <p>  --  Just tired , Olivia said . I used to work here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tired you ca n't feel your body anymore . <p> Laurie made a brushing gesture in the air , as if to wipe away all our remarks . <p>  --  O.K. , Vicki , you were talking about the clown at the door . What kind of clown ? The hobo type like Emmett Kelly ? <p>  --  No , no , the other kind . Vicki looked fierce . He had orange hair , a sad white face with big red lips , a huge nose , a baggy polka-dot costume and oversized feet . He carried one of those squeeze horns , too , and a big handful of balloons . <p>  --  Ugh , said Martha . I do n't like clowns either . <p>  --  So , anyway , he comes into the living room followed by my girlfriends , and they 're just rolling with laughter . Of course they all know about Johnny and me . Then he pulls a child 's slate out of one of his pockets , and writes in chalk : <p> Where 's the birthday girl ? <p>  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I was angry , and I could feel myself flushing . Johnny had really gone too far this time . <p>  --  The clown handed me the bouquet of balloons , then started playing " Happy Birthday " on a harmonica . My girlfriends started singing along . Afterwards , everyone applauded . Then , before I realized what was happening , the clown leaned down  --  he was really tall-and gave me a kiss with those big red lips . <p> Martha made a face <p>  --  On your cheek ? <p>  --  On my lips , Vicki said . And do you know what I did ? <p> She paused . The waitress had just returned with our beers and the basket of chips . We waited until she had set them in front of Martha and Olivia , and made a notation on the green bill underneath the napkin holder . <p>  --  What did you do ? Olivia asked in a low voice as the waitress left . <p>  --  I cried . I broke down and cried . <p>  --  Jesus , Laurie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The clown just stepped back like he 'd been slapped . Then he started apologizing in a normal man 's voice . He 'd been hired by my brother . <p> He was a semi-professional clown , and he was hired to play " Happy Birthday " he said , give me a birthday kiss , and then entertain us all for an hour with his clown act . Now he felt terrible . <p>  --  My girlfriends all took his side at once , and told me to lighten up . So I did . I swallowed the lump in my throat , winked back my tears , and tried to act normal and cheerful . The clown did his clown act  --  he squeezed his horn , squirted water out of his buttonhole flower  --  all the stuff they do , and I sat there with the others , pretending I thought it was funny , and applauding when it was over . But I hated it . And when the clown left , he came over and took my hand in his big white glove . He pantomimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezed my hand . He pulled out his slate again and wrote : I 'll call you soon . <p>  --  And did he Olivia held a chip in the air . <p>  --  Of course he did , Laurie laughed . That 's the whole point of the story . Go on , Vicki . <p>  --  He called me for a date the next day . I said no . I was sure Johnny had put him up to it anyway . Then one afternoon in January , when I got home from class , there he was in the house having coffee with my mother and Johnny . <p>  --  In his clown costume ? Olivia asked . <p> Vicki shook her head . <p>  --  He was wearing blue jeans and a sweatshirt . I did n't even know who he was at first . I just saw this hunk sitting on the couch across from my mother . <p>  --  So he was good-looking Laurie nodded . <p>  --  Not just good-looking , Vicki said emphatically . He was gorgeous . A dream guy  --  tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was awfully shy , and every time I looked at him he flushed to the eyeballs . It turned out that was why he 'd gone to clown school . <p>  --  You mean you can go to clown school ? Jesus , Martha said with a shudder . <p>  --  Apparently a lot of people want to be clowns , Vicki said . And you can learn how to be one . They teach you how to put on makeup , create your own character , and do clown-type things like ride tricycles and perform mime . Chris  --  that : was his name  --  always wanted to be a clown . When he was a clown , he lost his inhibitions , he said . It was a kind of therapy . Besides , he loved it . <p>  --  So you liked him , Laurie said . <p> Vicki nodded . My mother fixed me a cup of coffee , Johnny left , and I sat there talking with Chris . I loved the way he could n't quite look at me , but when he did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat , came into the room and started to walk over the back of the couch , and I saw Chris stiffen up . Cats made him anxious , he said , but when I told him I loved cats , he started petting Gingernut , and after that , whenever he was over and the cat came into the room , he made a point of stroking her and calling her " pretty kitty " even though you could tell he did n't really like touching her . <p> Vicki finished her beer , but kept staring down into her glass . <p>  --  I know I 've made it all sound really funny so far , she said , but Chris and I started going out , and it was n't long before we were both in love . <p> He was a sweet guy , really shy and kind and nervous around people . But he was so handsome that other girls would practically turn around on the street to look at him . I have to admit I really liked that . I was nineteen and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt anything like love for . Chris was the first . <p> What did he do when he was n't a clown ? Olivia asked . <p>  --  Oh , he was Johnny 's age . He 'd already finished college and worked as a systems analyst . He made good money , and had a nice apartment . I used to tell my parents that I was staying over at Johnnys , but I 'd really spend the night with Chris . I started taking the pill , and we made love . At first I was uptight , but after a while I relaxed and it was wonderful . Chris knew exactly where to touch me . Afterwards , I loved to curl up next to him and put my head on his chest and fall asleep while he was reading and gently stroking me . I felt so warm and safe . I started imagining what it would be like to live together , to get married . I began to lose interest in school . It was hard to concentrate . <p>  --  But what about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing , Vicki said . I just could n't bear the fact that he was a clown , and I refused to ever see him in his costume or go to any of his clown things or even talk about it . Once I 'd seen his polka-dot costume hanging in his closet with his suits , so I always made sure the closet door was shut after that . I was hoping of course that he 'd give it up , but he said it was important to him , it was his way of expressing himself  --  it was like his art , he said . So on certain nights or especially Saturday afternoons , I knew he was off being a clown , and I tried not to think about it . <p>  --  Did your brother keep teasing you ? Martha asked . <p>  --  No , he really liked Chris  --  they 'd met through some mutual friends , it turns out  --  and he either sensed how serious things were between Chris and me or else Chris spoke to him about it and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped completely . It was just this hidden thing Chris and I never talked about . <p>  --  Once , I remember , it was the summer after we 'd met , we went to the amusement park together and were having a great time . We were both soaked from the flume ride . Chris had won a blue teddy bear on the ring-toss , and I was holding a big pink cloud of cotton candy in one hand , and Chris 's hand in the other , when suddenly this clown in a patchwork costume , who was selling balloons , came out of the crowd and started waving at us . Johnny waved back . <p>  --  It 's Flim-Flam , he said . We met in clown school . She 's a really good clown . <p>  --  He started pulling me over to meet her , but I broke away and ran over to the Ferris wheel . The line was short and I got on right away . When I looked down from my car at the top , I saw Chris with the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Do n't you think you were going a little too far with the clown avoidance thing ? Laurie asked , frowning . <p>  --  I know I was acting a little crazy , Vicki said , looking around for the waitress . I need another beer . <p>  --  There she is , Olivia said . She 's talking to our man . Olivia meant the man with the grizzled hair . He was about forty with interesting planes to his face . We liked to speculate about him . <p>  --  You could have talked to his friend , Laurie insisted . Even if she was a clown . <p>  --  Hey , I 'm telling a story . Do I need to defend my actions , too ? It 's way in the past . <p>  --  I 'm just trying to understand , Laurie said . <p>  --  Well , your reaction , Vicki sighed , was exactly Chris 's reaction . Olivia waved her hand over our heads . <p>  --  She 's coming . Do you guys want another one , too ? <p>  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Olivia said . And another basket of chips . <p> The waitress smiled , and made a notation . She looked at Vicki . You know that guy over there , she said , he thinks he knows you from somewhere . He wanted to know if I knew you . <p> Vicki turned her head slightly to look . I 've never seen him before , she said . She looked pleased . <p>  --  So Chris got mad at you , Laurie said as soon as the waitress left . <p>  --  He was upset , Vicki said . He did n't say much but he seemed moody on the way home . And when he got back to his place he confronted me . He told me that he loved me , but being a clown was part of his life , and I had to accept it . Just as he 'd accepted the fact that I liked cats , and he did n't care for them much . And I had to admit it was true . He 'd even given me a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was free to talk about being a clown , to tell me about his experiences , but I did n't have to ever go with him or see him as a clown . And for a while that seemed to work . <p> But it was summer , and he had more and more chances to be a clown  --  there were a lot of children 's birthday parties in backyards , and he started getting invitations from church groups and hospitals . He was apparently one of the best clowns in the city . Something about Chris 's clown character appealed to everyone . <p>  --  Everyone who liked clowns to start with , Martha said . <p>  --  Right , Vicki agreed . <p>  --  Did he have a special clown name Laurie asked . <p>  --  Joujou , Vicki said . That 's French baby talk for toy . <p>  --  Joujou the clown . Martha made a face . <p>  --  I had a summer job at a travel agency downtown , Vicki said , and one Saturday evening I was hanging around waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clown thing that night , but he 'd said he would pick me up at six and drop me at home so we could have a little time together . <p>  --  The car pulled up and I ran out to get inside . But there was a clown at the wheel . Chris was in his costume . No , I shouted . I slammed the door shut , and ran down to the bus stop . Chris was following me in the car , but the bus got there first and I jumped on . I was panting and almost crying . <p>  --  We were both angry at each other for about a week . I felt betrayed and he felt I was acting stupid  --  he even got Johnny to try to talk to me about it , because he thought the game Johnny and I had been playing for years had contributed to my hysteria about clowns . That 's what he called it  --  hysteria . <p>  --  An ugly word . Martha nodded . <p>  --  He was so handsome , Vicki said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or going bike riding , or out for pizza . Other girls always turned around to look at us , and I knew they were green with envy . But the idea of going around in public with a clown , people turning their heads to look at us , laughing not just at him , but at me , to  --  it made me cringe with shame . <p>  --  It sounds to me as if the problem was more with you than with him , Laurie said . Poor guy . <p>  --  Clowns are id figures , Martha said . I think they 're creepy , too . <p>  --  Oh , for heavens sake , Olivia laughed . Do n't take sides . Let her finish . <p>  --  Do you want to hear this or not ? Vicki was looking directly at Laurie . <p> Laurie looked away . I 'm listening . <p>  --  It was a bad week for me . I really loved Chris , and I missed him terribly . And it was clear that everyone else was on his side  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them about it . Finally we made up . Chris said he loved me , too , and was almost ready to give up being a clown . But he just could n't , he said . If he killed Joujou , it would be like killing himself . We went for a long walk around the lake , and we agreed that gradually  --  that was the word , gradually  --  steps had to be taken to get me over my phobia . <p>  --  Phobia Martha shook her head . <p> Vicki took a long sip of her beer , then leaned forward determinedly . <p>  --  The idea was that I had to get used to Chris in the clown costume , she said . He thought it would be best if the occasion were a natural one for costumes . So we hit on Halloween . Some friends of his always had a party on Halloween . He would go as Joujou , and I would wear a costume , too . Everything would be natural and easy . The whole world would be in costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'd worn a few times before . It was pretty simple-black leotards , a sweatshirt hood with ears sewn onto it , a swishy cape and a black mask , long whiskers that I taped to my upper lip , and a yarn tail . I wore my tall black boots , too . <p>  --  All day I was nervous and dry-mouthed . Around six I got into my costume , and started pacing up and down the living room . My mother kept trying to calm me down , but she was sort of laughing at me , too . Underneath , she thought I was being silly . Then Chris knocked on the door  --  or rather , Joujou . <p>  --  He came into the living room , and my mother , who had never seen him as a clown before , admired him profusely . He honked his horn and did a few clown tricks for her , while I just stood there holding my cape together with one hand . <p>  --  C'm on Vicki , he said , reaching out for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . His natural voice seemed strange coming out of the clown face , and for the first time I really looked at Joujou . <p> He had a white face with red tears painted under eyes that gave the illusion of being stitched with thread . His red clown lips were painted in a wide circle around his real lips , and his putty nose was huge and misshapen . <p>  --  I followed him out to the car without a word . He took his white gloves off to drive , and the whole way over to the party I kept my eyes on his human hands gripping the wheel . I would n't look at his face , but I made a real effort to talk to him in a normal voice . <p>  --  Everyone was in costume at the party . There were gypsies and mummies and rock stars and witches and the usual assortment of Disney characters and spacemen , all dancing and drinking and talking together . But everyone looked like they were in costume , that they were just dressed up and pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the monsters had taken off their hot rubber masks , and the gypsies had lifted their half-masks , and rolled them back across the tops of their heads . But Joujou did n't seem to be in costume . He seemed real , and every time we danced to a slow song I felt sweaty and cold when he held me against him . <p>  --  Once , when I went to the bathroom , I saw that my cat whiskers were missing . I did n't want to lose them , because they 'd been pretty difficult to make , so I looked around for Chris . He was in the kitchen . <p>  --  Chris , I said , was I wearing my whiskers when we danced the last time ? <p>  --  Instead of answering , he began to squeeze his horn and gesture , and I realized that he had n't said a word all night . He was Joujou . <p> He was only speaking in mime , or writing on his slate . Everyone in the kitchen was laughing . He pretended to stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made comic snipping motions with his bulky white fingers . He pulled my whiskers out of one of his voluminous pockets , and handed them to me with a flourish . <p>  --  I took the whiskers and turned to go . Suddenly I felt a tug . <p> Joujou had me by the tail . Everyone was laughing hysterically . He pulled me back into the kitchen by my tail , and then my tail came off in his hand . <p>  --  I let him have the tail . I 'd been drinking wine , but now I went over to the table where the drinks were set out and fixed myself a gin and tonic , heavy on the gin . I got drunker than I 've ever been in my life . <p>  --  When the party ended , we went back to Chris 's place . I was so drunk I was numb all over . I remember that he undressed me and started kissing me , but I was only semi-conscious , more like a rag doll than a person . Once I opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with orange hair looming over me . Joujou was making love to me , not Chris . But I was too drunk to move or protest , and to escape I just closed my eyes . <p>  --  Thirst woke me up . It must have been near dawn , for the room was bathed in pale light , and I could see Chris 's naked body beside me . I half rose , still dizzy , with a splitting pain behind my eyes . I reached out to touch Chris 's thigh , then my eye traveled up to the head buried in the pillow , and I saw the white cheek and the corner of the red lip . He was still wearing his face makeup , and I was suddenly filled with great tenderness for him . I had what you might call a moment of insight . Joujou really was Chris . Joujou came from his interior life , and if I loved Chris , then of course I loved Joujou , too . <p>  --  Good for you , Laurie said . That 's exactly right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , shielding their expression . <p>  --  But my head felt funny , she said , and it was n't just because of my hangover . I reached up and touched something strange , like a cap over my own hair , then brushed my forehead . My skin felt caked and stiff . <p>  --  I got quickly out of bed . I almost stumbled on my cat costume , which was crumpled on the floor , but I grabbed the edge of the dresser in time . The bathroom tile felt like ice under my bare feet . I groped around for the light switch . <p>  --  A clown face stared back at me from the big mirror over the double sinks . It was a big , hideous white face with a huge grinning red mouth and blue-ringed eyes that were dripping painted tears . A bright pink spot glowed on each cheek . My long hair was tucked up into a curly orange wig . While I was passed out there on the bed , Chris had applied make-up to my face , and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of my naked body , perfectly human and attractive . I might have screamed if my mouth had n't been so dry . I made a croaking noise in my throat . <p>  --  My God , Laurie said . <p>  --  I just stared at the clown . I thought I must be dreaming and pinched myself . But I was n't . <p>  --  What did you do ? Martha whispered . <p> -I picked up Chris 's can of shaving lotion and I sprayed it all over the mirror until I could n't see the clown anymore . Then I flung the wig in the garbage and got in the shower . I scrubbed all the makeup off and washed it down the drain . Then I went back into the bedroom for my cat costume , and I put it on , minus the tail and whiskers . Chris was still sleeping . I left the house , and later in the day I called him and told him I never wanted to see him again . <p>  --  Did n't you let him explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . Nope , she said . And that 's the end of my story . Now I 've really got to take a piss . <p> She yawned and stretched her arms above her head . Then she got up and on her way to the ladies ' can she passed close to the table where the man with the grizzled hair was sitting . They looked at each other and smiled . We knew that soon she 'd be telling us all about him . <p>
