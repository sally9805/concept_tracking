HER NAME WAS Mari Barbola . <p> She glares out from the lower right-hand corner of Velazquez 's Las Meninas , a painting which hangs in a darkened room of its own in Madrid 's Prado , above a marble plaque reading La obra culminante del arte universal : " The culminating work of universal art . " <p> It is a curious painting : the seemingly casual arrangement of the figures , the vast looming darkness that takes up a good two-thirds of the canvas give it the effect of a snapshot , somehow overexposed at the bottom and underexposed above , almost as if a tourist had taken a wrong turn in the halls of the Alcazar and found herself in a corridor leading back three-hundred-odd years , the rubber soles of her Adidas squeaking against the marble tiles of the palace floor , the snap of her gum echoing in the sepulchral halls , until , turning a corner , she suddenly caught a glimpse of the royal assembly and lifted her Kodak to snap this picture where no one , save Velazquez , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barbarian , is aware of her presence : catching this canvas before the figures on it dissolve back into the air of time . <p> Mari Barbola is scarcely taller than the five-year-old white-white Infanta Margarita , the center of the painting , the child of an Austrian mother and a Hapsburg father , the two pale monarchs who rule over this dark-eyed , dark-haired people , who in turn rule over others with darker eyes and darker hair . Mari Barbola stares out of the canvas , her doughy face defiant : she is the only one of non-royal blood in the painting who does not bend , kneel , lean . She stands upright . Unlike the midget next to her , his slipper-clad foot resting on the back of a docile Alsatian , she is no perfect miniature . As big around as she is tall , the critics who write in centuries to come will cavalierly describe her as " ugly . " But we know who makes the rules , who blesses the vapid , wormwhite infanta with the word " beautiful , " decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die for . <p> Barbola was brought to Madrid from Germany , having been sold by her parents to a passing noble who offered them ten astonishing pieces of silver ( they could scarcely suppress their glee : she had accompanied them to market not to be sold , but to watch over the stall as they went about their business ) , then given by this viscount as a gift to a Spanish noble , and finally passed up to the king . <p> And so she found herself , on the 17th day of September , 1632 , conveyed into Madrid in the back of a cart , the city where Philip IV 's grandfather had settled the itinerant Spanish court , which previously had proceeded in a sluggish imperial round from Toledo to Valladolid to Burgos ; Madrid which had been a miserable town on a barren Castilian plain , battered by hot winds in the summer and cold winds in the winter . Oh , foolish , foolish Philip ! Why did you fix your court here , in the dead center of Spain , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant dominions which are your wealth ? Why did you build the great carved Segovia gate , the ornate entryway into this crude boomtown of muddy streets and slapped-together shacks and open sewers ? With all those fey , turreted castles of Spain , why did you choose to lock yourself up here in this squat , thick-walled , narrow-windowed fortress , the Alcazar ? <p> But to Mari Barbola , a daughter of the Bavarian peasantry who had grown up in a one-room lumber hut , with pigs and a donkey and a cow ( the years her family was lucky enough to have a cow ) rooting and braying and lowing about her , and then had spent a year or two in a dark cranny of the viscount 's upper rooms , this Madrid , with its rougecheeked ladies with their ruff collars of linen spun so fine it is translucent , then locked into stiff waves ( wheat going for starch while the uprooted peasants wander the countryside eating herbs and roots ) , those collars that seem to capture movement , the gem-encrusted farthingales which catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the endlessly-contravened sumptuary laws , this Madrid seemed an incandescent city . <p> Oh , foolish , foolish race of Philips ! In Las Meninas , Philip IV , alongside his second queen , is reflected dimly in a distant mirror . In the earlier portraits Velazquez has painted of him , Philip is dressed in black tights which do as much as they can to disguise his knobby knees ; a pasty-faced , liver-lipped youth attempts a regal pose in Philip IV in Armor , but with his peach-fuzz mustache and frightened eyes , it is not hard to imagine him hanging out at the mall , a Marlboro dangling from his lips , willing to be the butt of his companions ' jokes for the privilege of being near them ; his queen , Mariana of Austria , is a sullen , flatcchested half-child , overwhelmed by her hoop skirts of woven gold and silver and pearls , her hair fixed into an elaborate starched coif that echoes the shape of the flying buttresses of her skirts . <p> Poor you ! Poor Philip ! lost in the mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Spains , Old and New , King of the Goths , of Austria , of Lusitania , of Celtiberia , of Cantabria , of Italy , of Flanders , the Planet King ; King of Castile and Aragon , of the two Sicilies , Jerusalem , Portugal , the Canary Islands , of the East and West Indies , Archduke and Phoenix of the Fragrant Remains of the House of Austria , king over the future realm of the L.A. freeways , Aspen , John Wayne Airport , Acapulco , the beachfront condos in Puerto Vallarta , the tin mines of Bolivia , the street corners all across Latin America where the Chiclet sellers sell their wares , Caracas , Buenos Aires , etcetera ; ruler of Picardy , Luxembourg , the Philippines ; King of Slaves and Slavers and Torturers , Defender and Zealous Protector of the Blessed Virgin 's Immaculate Conception , Duke of Brabant , Duke of Milan , Count of Flanders , Count of Tirol , Count of Barcelona , Monarch of Shadows . <p> But although Philip is king , Mariana of Austria is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madrid : someone else fills that role , an Isabella , this one of Bourbon , who , like her successor , gives birth to robust girls and sickly boys . It is to one of these frail , pale infantes , Baltasar Carlos , that Mari Barbola becomes companion . <p> I know what you expect of her : that she 'll either be a dull stone before whom the swirling waters of palace intrigue part , or that she 'll be a mini-Rasputin who spends her first years at court staring dully and accumulating a storehouse of valuable gossip , which she 'll later unleash to good use , finding herself petted and curried and hated . But she 's neither : she figures out what she needs to know , but she is n't vicious ; she 's as devious and placid as you or I. She eats the leftovers from the royal table : she 's happy . <p> Not that life at the court is any smooth round of pleasures . The pale and sickly prince dies , to be replaced by another pale prince who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble , petted mother , who is dressed in gold and lace and swathed in titles and humped like a brood mare , weakened from the unceasing rounds of pregnancies and births , fades , falls ill , and , although the holy corpse of St. Isidore the Husband-man and a fragment of the True Cross are brought to her bedside , dies . How often Mari Barbola finds herself dressed in black mourning and shuffling off to the Convent of the Discalced Carmelites or to the mausoleum of a palace called El Escorial , the slag heap , to attend another interment or say yet another mass for the repose of a royal soul . <p> Sometimes the gloomy round is broken by an auto-da-fe . The best are held in the Plaza Mayor : once , Mari even got to sit with the King and Queen and the infante ( was it Baltasar Carlos or was he dead by then ? Maybe it was one of the infantas , she ca n't quite remember ) in their balcony draped with velvet of oxblood red held back by swags made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , because the processional from the Convent of Dona Maria de Aragon , which bears the great green cross , is followed by great gangs of priests bearing waxen tapers , torch bearers and fagot bearers , yes , fire must be brought from every single monastery and nunnery in Madrid , and  --  well you ca n't imagine the torchlight procession of the Nazi youth in Triumph of the Will happening in broad daylight , can you ? But of course , the actual burning of the heretics could n't happen in the dark , because nobody would be able to see a thing . No , so there has to be a solemn , night-long vigil , the flames kept alive with great ceremony . <p> The next morning the Jews are brought out . They pretended to have converted , but really , in their hearts they never bought that God 's seed entered the womb of Mary through her ear , that , four days dead , Lazarus draped his graveclothes over his arm and trotted happily out of his tomb . After five years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , just as the Inquisition was informed , they met secretly and tortured a picture of Christ , who came alive and gently , mournfully rebuked them for this sin , but no , they did not listen . What did they do then ? Why , then they all went out and sneaked into churches , stole the consecrated host and wolfed it down like naughty boys at the cookie jar , pissed in the font of holy water . And what else ? the inquisitor asks , nodding to his assistant , who tightens , tightens the screws . What else ? they plead , their brains so filled with pain they have no room left for lies . Is n't that enough ? What more did we do ? they plead . The inquisitor nods again to his assistant . What more did you do ? Finally he asks , did n't you then have sexual congress with the devil in a female form ? Why yes , how could it possibly have slipped our minds , yes , of course , then we all fucked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not in a female form . <p> I wish that she had shuddered , my Mari , sneered ( sure , sure , and then the portrait of Christ wept tears of blood , yeah , uh-huh ) , but she did n't . While the queen blushes red as the charge is read about unnatural acts with the devil right there in the lap of the Holy Mother church , Mari leans forward , full of lascivious disgust . She does n't avert her eyes for a single moment as each monastery adds its touch of flame to the bonfire . <p> But now it seems there is n't a single heretic left to torch , and even the Moors are gone , not taken out to sea in ships and sunk , as Philip 's grandfather seriously considered , nor slaughtered wholesale , as Philip 's father 's most trusted advisor counseled him , nor withered away through the castration of all males and the abduction of all children , as more humane voices suggested , but , leaving behind all their worldly goods and chattel and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume , have merely , like the Jews , been expelled . Now they are all gone , those who were supposed to take with them all their treachery and chicanery and leave behind a Spain so pure it would almost rise of its own accord , up , up into the unbearable blue of the Spanish sky , and who instead have left behind this storm 's eye of depression , the royal court . <p> Philip slumps on his throne while the fools and jesters try in vain to bring a smile to his face . Hoping to relieve his imperial boredom , he takes his queen to bed , fantasizing about the pockmarked kitchen girl he has taken a fancy to . Hoping that he has this time impregnated his seventeen-year-old consort with a male , but knowing that any child born of such a rustless coupling will be wan and frail , he wanders to Velazquez 's studio where he spends the afternoon slumped on a chaise , watching the artist at work and yawning . Sulking Queen Mariana , who can not abide Philip 's moodiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of Philip 's depression seeps into her , summons Mari Barbola to sit next to him at table . <p> " Mari , " he says , halfway through the supper , " why have n't you said anything to amuse me ? " <p> " I 'm hungry , " she responds , gnawing at a lamb shank . " So I 'm eating . " <p> This remark sends the table into laughter . Humor is like beer : it does n't travel . ( The court fool Borra was said to have killed his master , King Martin , by telling him the following joke : " Out in the vineyard , I saw a young deer hanging by his tail from a tree , as if someone had so punished him for stealing figs . " Whereupon the king died of laughter . ) <p> Queen Mariana hoots , slaps her knee , and although she has been warned that outright laughter is considered unseemly in the Spanish Court , cries out , her speech punctuated at odd intervals by bursts of giggles : " Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketplace , what say the people of our great nation ? How fares it ? " <p> " Your Majesty , " Mari speaks around mouthfuls of stringy lamb , " in the mercado one sees many beggars and many rich people . The beggars implore alms and crusts of bread ; yet the rich envy them , for at least they have nothing . " <p> " For at least they have nothing .... " Queen Mariana hoots , and even dour Philip smiles . <p> " Yes , " Mari repeats , blinking and staring coldly at the queen , " because the rich have less than nothing , they owe everywhere , to everyone- " <p> The queen hoots again and then , gathering her vast skirts in her arms , comes towards Mari , takes her into her arms , lifts her into the air , and kisses her . <p> The court little people straddle the divide between pets and servants , sometimes acting as living toys , or sometimes frank Cassandras : dogs whose yowling , warning of the coming earthquake , will only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bankrupt splendor of the Spanish Court ! There is no money , not a single real ; the royal archives are filled with obsequiously worded petitions from maidservants and grooms demanding back wages ; yet there is no decrease in the number of maidservants and grooms , or in the finery in which they are arrayed : like every servant in Spain , they go about clad in silks and linens which they pay for in coins of air . <p> A dinner is given for Philip and his queen by one of his nobles , and one of the thousand dishes served is a stew which contains one calf , four sheep , two hundred pigeons , a hundred partridges , a hundred rabbits , one thousand pigs ' trotters and one thousand tongues , two hundred fowls , thirty hams , and five hundred sausages . Yet a few months later , a capon is served to the Infanta Maria Theresa and her half-sister , Margarita , which she orders removed from their presence , as it stinks like a dead dog ; instead she is served chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of buzzing flies . Maria Theresa gags , slaps the hand of the hungry Margarita who stretches out her hand for the chicken , then weeps . There 's nothing else in the kitchen , and the shopkeepers refuse to extend any further credit . Mari Barbola lets Maria Theresa carry on for a while , weeping and wailing and gnashing her teeth , before Mari pulls off her ring , a ring that the Infante Baltasar Carlos traded her for a sweet bun when he was four years old . The adults were so amused they allowed her to keep it . She holds the ring aloft between thumb and forefinger , then strides out into the street , returning shortly with the apron of her skirt full of oranges and hams and loaves of bread , a sweet bun . ( For once , a loan has not only been repaid to the Spanish court , but repaid with interest . ) <p> What has happened to Moctezuma 's ransom , to the past of the Aztecs and their subject nations , the rings and sacred tablets and gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Some say that it passes through the hand of this official and that bureaucrat , dribbling steadily away as it moves ) and then goes abroad , to pay the interest on the usurious loans that were taken out during the glory days of Spain , and to buy silk purses , linen collars which the sumptuary laws forbid the making of in Spain . Some say that no sooner does the plunder of America arrive in Spain than it is returned to the earth from which it was wrenched , reinterred to be safe from the tax collectors . For this the Aztecs and Mayans and Incas are being worked to death in the hot , hot American sun , imploring their dead gods in Nahuatl and Maya and Quechua ? <p> But now Mari Barbola has been summoned to the royal gallery for a sitting ( some sitting ! Velazquez leaves them on their feet all day , even the five-year-old Margarita and poor Dona Mariana Sarmiento who has to balance herself , kneeling and holding forth a golden tray ) . Stand here . Stand here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your Most Royal Highness might want to take a step to the right . Perfect ! Jose Nieto , master of the royal tapestry works , and the king and queen do n't have to hang about posing : they appear in the painting , but will be added in later . It 's Mari Barbola and Nicolasico Pertusato and the maids of honor who can be ordered to wait about ; and the infanta who must , after all , be taught to have the desires of others be her desires , so that at the age of fifteen she can be handed over as wife to the German Emperor . <p> In the painting , the embellished cross of the Order of Santiago appears on Velazquez 's breast , but it was added afterwards , reportedly by the king himself . When he paints Las Meninas he is petitioning for admission to that order . A report , which takes 113 days to prepare , for which 148 witnesses are sworn and deposed , decrees that Velazquez has successfully proved that his lineage is untainted by Moorish or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have sprung from noble lineage ( after all , Daddy , although he called himself a merchant , was really a huckster , rushing about Seville buying dear and selling cheap , and could n't even call himself Don ) , no matter that his family insisted that the de Silvas , from whence his father sprung , were descended from Aeneas Silvius , King of Alba Longa , and were thus related to the kings of Leon . A dispensation from His Holiness Pope Alexander VII is needed so that Velazquez can , at last , be sworn into that order which he has so long coveted . <p> Endless treatises will be written about this painting . One tome sets forth , in the third of its appendices , a sampling of the pigments that were used in it , identification of said pigments having been made via polarizing microscopy , X-ray powder diffraction , and X-ray fluorescence analysis using either a scanning electron microscope or electron-beam microprobe . For instance , the light brown stretcher support of the canvas , near the lower left corner , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in the range of 40-60 percent ) , yellow ocher , charcoal/bone black , calcite , smalt , and perhaps red ocher or vermilion ; while Nicolasico Pertusato 's left stocking is lead white , vermilion , red lake , calcite , and charcoal/bone black . Others will plot the geometric relationships between the figures that occupy this space , drawing triangles , equilateral and isosceles , some that reach beyond the frame of the painting . <p> The king and queen are there but not there , pale reflections in the milk glass of a distant mirror ; while Dona Marcela de Ulloa , dressed in mourning garb that resembles a nun 's habit , speaks to another old retainer , both fading back into the shadows . Jose Nieto , firmly planted in his rectangle of light , the head of the royal tapestry factory , whose offspring will be the kings of industry , pauses on the steps that lead away from the darkness that is settling over the Spanish court . <p> Dona Mariana Sarmiento kneels before the Infanta Margarita , offering her on a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cup made of soft clay from South America , clay gathered from muddy riverbanks by Indians who have seen their sisters and brothers burned alive by literal fire or by those plagues and poxes the Europeans brought with them ; the special red-clay cup which , when empty , can be chewed and swallowed . The infanta is about to reach out her hand and drink the blood and sweat , eat the dead flesh of her American subjects . <p> Nicolasico Pertusato sets his foot on the drowsy Alsatian recumbent at his feet , sets his foot on the uneasy divide between the human and the animal , us and them , while Mari Barbola , frank and ugly Mari Barbola , stares out from the edge of the canvas at us : look , she says . Look . Here . This is the way it was . Look . <p> Seventy-five years later , an underpaid lackey in the kitchen allows a flame too close to a vat of oil . When he sees what he has done , he sneaks from the Alcazar , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thick red wine while he hears the shouts of Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! , the out-of-breath gossip delivered by those who have just come from the yards around the court . The fire has climbed up worn velvet curtains , lapped up carved mahogany tables and silk brocades ; the infantas and the ladies-in-waiting have hitched up their skirts and run pell-mell for the doors , dashing alongside scullery maids and courtiers and the king . Outside , the royal family catches its collective breath and then orders the servants back in , to fetch jewels and gold and strands of pearls ( the pretty globes found lodged in clamshells that the mga katutubo used to dive for late in the afternoon , roll about in their palms , and perhaps leave lying in the sand , that the Kastila are ready to risk their lives for ) . The lucky ones return with sweat running down their faces , wheezing , carrying jewelry boxes , fortunes stuffed in their pockets , or staggering under the weight of the immense canvases , the paint blistering and running in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the painting has been borne for safety , paint runs down Mari Barbola 's doughy face as she stares out at the frantic racing , the flames surging higher and higher through the doomed palace of the Alcazar . <p> 212 years after the burning of the Alcazar , 287 years after Velazquez painted Las Meninas , outside a town in Poland , 1,232 kilometers from Madrid , a man in a military uniform speaks to a woman wearing thin pajamas . <p> " You see  --  the problem with the photographs , " he says , shaking them out of the manila file and onto his desk . They stand , not exactly side by side , but as a junior clerk might stand in the presence of the owner of a firm . <p> " Now you see , this one  --  she had a very interesting texture to her skin , a certain kind of fat deposit underneath her chin , " he tugs at the flesh of his own neck to indicate , " which the camera does n't capture at all . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most annoying . Stop it . " She stops . So much for what her professors had said about involuntary movement . Or perhaps it was just that at that place , in that time , the laws of nature had also been suspended . <p> " And then this one , " he says , throwing down a photograph of a fat dwarf with an outsized head , " he had sexual organs like a child 's , but again the camera  --  " <p> " The camera 's eye is flat . It captures everything and so , sometimes , fails to see the essential . " She knows she is taking an enormous risk in saying these words that might be read as insolent . On the other hand , sometimes cowering , putting one 's tail between one 's legs , did n't work either . Every day in this place you engaged in a game of Russian roulette , never certain if the words you spoke would allow you to live for a while longer or trigger your death . That , of course , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always in their hands . <p> " Precisely , " he says . <p> She was about to say , " When I was a medical illustrator in Prague . . . " and mention the name of a famous doctor she had worked with , but she decides against it , and merely looks at the floor and mumbles , " I was a medical illustrator in Prague . " <p> " Oh , that 's good . Very good . I did n't know that . Come along . You can get started right away . The doctors will let you know if there 's some feature they want emphasized . " <p> She is following him down the hallway when he adds , " Also , there 's the matter of the cost of the photographic process . " And laughs a little at his own joke . Only his way of letting her know that although they are walking down the corridor together , although she made an observation to which he responded , " Precisely , " she is worth less than the thin layer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few pfennigs ' worth of developing salts . <p> A man in a white coat joins them . She is led to a cubicle . <p> Usually , the dwarfs are brought in by an orderly ; occasionally , it is a doctor who accompanies them , when he has some special instruction he wants to give the illustrator , whose given name is Dina , although it has been months now since anyone has called her by her given name . The dwarfs arrive quite naked and yet they never seem ashamed . <p> Once someone left a chair here . Because it is still here , for a few days Dina is able to sit down as she works . Her body has long since gnawed up the fat of its own belly , its own breasts , and turned finally to the fat that pads the balls of her heel , leaving a raw pain between heel-bone and ground . <p> And then one day the chair is gone . <p> Sometimes the door of the cubicle is left open , sometimes it is closed . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it herself . <p> Sometimes , the doctors bring her an inch or two of soup in a coffee mug , a napkin holding a scrap of bread . It is against the rules , but they like her work , they do n't want to lose her to typhoid or cholera . <p> Usually , it is quite straightforward : front ; rear ; left side ; right side . She does n't speak to them , except to ask them to turn . What can they possibly say to each other ? Sometimes , she is told to do a more detailed sketch : of a patient 's genitalia , or of a deformity. name ? " <p> The doctor holds Lia Graf 's hand as they come down the corridor . She smiles up at him as he bends down and lifts her up onto the table . Dina has never seen a doctor touch one of them before . <p> " Today we have a celebrity for you . From From  --  " " and he begins to laugh . <p> " The Barnum and Bailey Circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barnum and Bailey , " he repeats , his German accent turning the words into guttural commands . " And she became quite a little celebrity when she sat on the lap of J. P. Morgan . The usual four sketches . " <p> " Goodbye , doctor , " she trills , but he makes no response . <p> She is perfectly proportioned , roughly two-thirds of a meter tall . Instinctively , no doubt because of her theatrical background , she assumes a somewhat coquettish stance . She is in her mid-thirties . Warts on her elbows . One missing tooth . But otherwise quite well-preserved . <p> " No . Do n't pose . Just stand there . Arms at your sides . And please turn around . " Dina dislikes doing the front views ; she always does them last . <p> Lia turns her head over her shoulder and mouths : " What is your <p> After a nearly thirty seconds pause , the answer is mouthed back , " Dina . " <p> " Lie Graf .... Where are you from ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then : " How long ? " <p> " Just stand there , " Dina says aloud . " Your head as it was . I can not draw you properly if you do n't hold still . " <p> " Please . It 's important for me . To know . " <p> " Quiet , " Dina says , and draws her finger across her throat . <p> Dina works in silence until the evening siren is sounded . Then she is returned to the barracks and Lia Graf to the ward . <p> The next morning , they resume . The doctor does n't bring her this morning , but instead a nurse , dressed in white . Dina is the one who hoists her onto the table . The nurse closes the door behind him . <p> " Your left side now . " <p> After a few minutes , Lia says , certainly not in a normal speaking voice , but not in the barely audible whisper of the day before : " The door is closed . Will you not talk to me now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It distracts me . " <p> " Distracts you from your drawing ? " <p> " No . From staying alive . " <p> " But I talk to you because I want to live . " <p> " Everyone wants to live . They all wanted to live . " The cubicle is windowless , so she can not gesture to the plume of smoke . Instead , she wrinkles her nose at the stench in the air . Add then makes a sound . What shall we call it : laughter , a hoot , a snort ? Any of those will do equally well , or poorly . Ordinary language is another thing that does not fare well here . <p> " You are cruel . " <p> " I am alive . " <p> " So am I. And I am going to go on living . " <p> Dina laughs again . " How long have you been here ? " <p> " Do n't mistake me for a child . We are used to that assumption . We often turn it to our advantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 38 .

Her grandparents had believed the old story about the two white doves that for over a millennium had come and perched on the roof of the synagogue to save it from fire ; yes , and believed too that there was an underground tunnel leading straight from the Old Jewish Town to Jerusalem . Right up until March 15 , 1938 , they had believed these things . Her parents did not believe any such fairy tales ; no , they believed that their Jewishness was a coat they could slip out of and hang on a convenient hook , to put on again when they chose . Her mother even took Dina to the Mala Strana at Christmas to see the pastry angels with their wings of spun sugar set out in the windows of the bakery shop , the quaint customs of the Christians . For a second , as Dina speaks , she smells not the smell that is everywhere in that place , but the smell of cinnamon , the smell of fresh snow , the smell of the tram wheels as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lia says , " Go on . " <p> " That 's all . " <p> " Go on . " <p> " What do you hope to accomplish by this ? " <p> " It helps me understand . " <p> " This ? You will never understand this . " <p> " I think I almost do . Go on , " Lia orders . <p> Lia , you can see what this is doing to her . Why are you insisting so ? It 's not as if there were something unusual about this story . It could be the story of any of a hundred , a thousand , a million other sensitive girls with souls that aspired beyond the quotidian . The desire to be an artist , the mother who nurtured her dreams and the father who mocked her . She compromised , agreed to study medical illustration as well . And four years after she graduated , during the terrible winter of ' 31 , working days doing drawings for medical professors , nights her own work , she saw the boy wunderkind who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and turned away before he could see her and so be ashamed . Nights and weekends she painted her pictures of the robust young girls from the country she hired as models . You 've seen this play before , Lia , you know the final act : the god of death goose-steps out of a trap door in the floor of the stage and puts an end to all this silly palavering about the soul of the artist . <p> But you say , " Go on . " <p> She 's furious now , Lia . That hand that once patiently delineated the coils and flutings of a bacterium now presses the pencil so hard it engraves the paper . <p> " Go on , " she says . " Tell me about the beautiful country girls you drew . Go on . I think I almost understand this . " <p> The paintings Dina made in Prague are gone , chucked out by the German-speaking Czechs who took over her family 's house . A few prewar photos of Lia Graf remain : publicity stills , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Morgan 's lap ; but most of the pictures of her are gone , gone up in smoke like Lia and Dina themselves . On a dusty shelf in an archive in a brown manila envelope kept shut by a twisted piece of string are the four drawings Dina made of Lia , left side , right side , rear , front ( is she really almost smiling ? ) , along with the medical report , the genealogy , and the autopsy report . <p> <p> By ANNE FINGER <p>
