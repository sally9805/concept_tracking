Even as a child , I connected the infamous Capt . William Bligh of the mutinous ship Bounty with food . On television in those days , there was an ad that ran again and again during programs for kids , in which a tyrannical Bligh yelled at his first mate : " Mr. Christian , come here . I want my Post Toasties . " The same line was shouted frequently at school because we had a classmate whose last name was Christian . Somewhat later , I must have found out the real link between Bligh and food when I read the Nordhoff and Hall novel Mutiny on the Bounty . But I retained only the main story line , in which a South Pacific idyll turned into a classic drama of survival on the open seas when Bligh 's crew revolted and set him afloat in midocean in a small boat . Recently , as part of my research for this magazine , I have been reminded that the Bounty voyage and the mutiny were , in fact , part of what might be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-minded energies into transporting a useful plant from the Old World to the New , and his seamen grew weary of doubling as nurserymen for more than a thousand heavy tubs of Artocarpus altilis . While Europe stood on the brink of universal disruption and revolt in 1789 , Bligh was trying to fulfill his mission of bringing breadfruit from Tahiti to Jamaica . He was executing a plan conceived by the influential botanist Joseph Banks , who , when he traveled to the Pacific with Captain Cook , had observed firsthand how breadfruit made the happy indolence of Polynesian life possible . Banks reasoned that if this bountiful plant could be cultivated in proximity to the slave plantations of the West Indies , it would solve or at least alleviate a fundament problem . It would feed the slaves and eliminate or greatly reduce the need for plantation owners to give them time off from financially productive labor in sugar cane fields to work on their own vegetable gardens . From our point of view ( and perhaps that of the slaves , who must have cherished the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the Banks plan looks diabolical . But a just destiny determined its ultimate fortunes , human and horticultural . Right off , the pendulum swung away from Banks : the mutineers threw the breadfruit overboard . But Bligh survived his 4,000-mile lifeboat ordeal , sailed back to Tahiti , and after possibly mitigating his management style , did finally land in Jamaica in 1793 at the helm of the Providence , whose decks looked like forests . Most of Bligh 's troubles had been caused , at the most fundamental level , not by human nature per se , but by human tampering with nature . A. altilis , as Bligh and Banks found it under cultivation in Polynesia , was a seedless plant . At some point in its travels from its birthplace in the Malay Archipelago , perhaps many times , the breadfruit was cloned from the rootstock of specially desirable seedless trees . So Bligh could n't just collect a lot of seeds and sail away . He had to take whole trees , trees so sensitive to cold that they had to be dragged belowdecks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even then , the Banks plan continued to misfire . Slaves refused to eat breadfruit ... until they were freed . That , at least , is the legend that has come down to us . And the story is so appealing , we may as well accept it and not go looking for alternative explanations ( for example , that it may have taken a while for the Bligh trees to fruit in quantity in their new home , and that the odd taste of breadfruit , of which more later , may have taken a generation or two to catch on ) . Between the end of slavery in the British Empire ( 1838 ) and now , however , breadfruit has established itself firmly in the cuisines of the Caribbean . In certain islands , affection for these large ( six pound ) , green , spherical fruits , with their pustular rinds and smooth white pulp , runs very deep , perhaps nowhere more so than in Saint Vincent , a lush volcanic island west of Barbados . Since 1979 , Saint Vincent and thirty-two sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saint Vincent and the Grenadines . While the local economy is heavily dependent on the export of bananas , Vincentians love breadfruit with an unashamed passion . I discovered this first in conversation with a woman health worker in New York . At the time , I was routinely asking Caribbean emigres about breadfruit . Some expressed only routine interest . This woman , whose nationality I did n't know , lit up immediately and recommended steaming breadfruit and serving it with kingfish . Yes , that was really delicious , and she hoped a friend of hers would be bringing some with her on the plane from Kingstown ( not Kingston but Kingstown , the capital of Saint Vincent ) . At the shop in the Kingstown airport , T-shirts emblazoned with breadfruit are for sale . Where the cab turns on to the highway , a tall tree towers ; from it dangle dozens of green orbs . I assume that soon I will be tasting the fruit itself in one of the myriad cooked forms that I have been reading about . But it is nowhere to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep missing it here and there . It is always sold out before I get there or out of reach on trees , such as the big clone of a tree brought over by Bligh that is the main attraction of the botanical gardens high above the city center . The national dish , I am told , is buljol ( a salt cod salad served on many islands ) with breadfruit . One restaurant promises the dish but has to substitute eddoes ( a potatolike taro ) for breadfruit . I am ready to start climbing trees to get my own fruit , but I have n't a clue how to pick one that 's ripe . ( It turns out that different recipes call for different degrees of ripeness , from green and hard to mottled and soft . In the U. S. Northeast , breadfruit is available unpredictably in Caribbean markets , stored in tubs of water . ) At last , on the way to our flight home from the Kingstown airport , we pass a roadside stand selling whole fruit completely blackened from charcoal baking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh inside . He removes the fibrous " gut " from the center and makes it clear that it is time to eat . It tasted like ... bread . White bread of the spongy variety . An acquired taste and not one I am going to work hard acquiring . Perhaps I 'd like it with a sauce or deep-fried like French fries ( green breadfruit is said to resemble the texture of potatoes ) . Polynesians allegedly flavor bland green breadfruit with mushy , pungent , very ripe fermented breadfruit . Are they aware that the fermentation provides a significant amount of vitamin C , just as it does for fermented cabbage ( sauerkraut ) ? European sailors discovered that breadfruit consumption lowered the rate of scurvy on long voyages . Breadfruit also comes off relatively well as a source of protein ( 1.3 grams per 100 grams ) , warding off khwashiorkor among Polynesian children . Like any staple food , breadfruit has inspired a large variety of recipes . The hard , green fruit can be treated like a potato  --  baked , boiled , or mashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until chewable but still crunchy . To reach a stage soft enough to pure , count on at least thirty-five minutes . In Polynesia , the primordial method of cooking breadfruit is in a pit , with heated stones , in other words , a luau . I had breadfruit this way in New Zealand , at Rotorua , where the heat came from geothermal steam geysers . The culinary result was Polynesian , very bland and pasty . Is the charbroiled breadfruit I had on Saint Vincent a Polynesian survival , a transfer of an African method to an exotic fruit , or a spontaneous development on the island ? It is hard to know , but there is no doubt about the originality of the Jamaican dish that combines Pacific breadfruit with the African fruit called ackee and with salt cod introduced from Europe . It might serve as an emblem for the complexity o Caribbean culture . And no one would say it was dull in terms of taste . In the French islands , the breadfruit has also spurred cooks to rise to a difficult occasion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Domingo ( I follow data provided by Andre Negre in Antilles et Guyane a Travers Leur Cuisine ) . In 1820 fruit abounded , but a Colonel Boyer-Peyreleau curled his lip and predicted that breadfruit would never play a part in human nutrition . Nevertheless , Creole cooks on the French island adapted fruit a pain to many of their own recipes . For example , they mixed together eggs and pureed breadfruit and deep-fried it as acras , fritters descended from an African original first made with black-eyed pea flour and still seen on the streets of Lagos ( akara ) and in northeast Brazil ( acaraje ) . There is a crab and breadfruit colombo , a curry adapted from recipes of East Indian laborers brought to the islands in the nineteenth century . ( Actually , the name colombo may indicate a connection with the capital of the former Ceylon  --  now Sri Lanka  --  rather than with coolies , as Dr. Negre suggests . In any case , the French islanders refer to their conventional prepared commercial curry powder as poudre de colombo . And Dr. Negre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) In other stewlike preparations with allegedly Carib names ( migan , matete ) , breadfruit serves as a creamy thickened or a more solid , potatolike starch . As I type these words , my interest in breadfruit revives . Perhaps Negre is right and a crab-breadfruit matte ' is a splendid dish . Still , I do not expect to see breadfruit , this unexpected first cousin of the fig , mulberry , and Osage orange ( all members of the Moraceae family ) , become the next fad fruit . To paraphrase Secretary of the Treasury Bentsen , the breadfruit is no kiwi . And yet I take heart from the real success of A. altilis in its intended New World home . Islanders chose it freely and only after they had free choice . There is also some comfort in knowing that Banks and Bligh did not undermine the system of slave gardening that , as scholars Sidney Mintz and Lydia Pulsipher have shown , was a crucial outlet for African initiative and survival , both literal and cultural , before emancipation .

Remove ackee from pods . Discard seeds and the pink membrane in the cleft of each fruit . 2 . Wash and combine with the cod in a large quantity of boiling water . As soon as the ackee is tender , drain fruit and fish in a colander . Separate ackee from fish and , after cleaning skin and bones , flake the fish . 3 . Heat butter and oil in a skillet . Add onions , thyme , and chili . When onions are translucent , add fish and ackee . Stir for a few minutes , trying not to crush the ackee. 4 .

Replace the slice from the top of the breadfruit . Roast over an open fire until outside is completely blackened and a trussing needle pushed into the breadfruit penetrates easily , or bake in a 350-degree oven for a half hour or until tender . 6 . Peel the fruit before serving . ( Alternatively , and perhaps more practically , roast the breadfruit whole , peel and core while hot , and stuff with hot salt cod and ackee mixture . ) Yield : 4 servings <p>
