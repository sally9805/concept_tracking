STARRING : Anthony Hopkins , Jessica Lange , Alan Cumming , Laura Fraser , Harry Lennix DIRECTOR : Julie Taymor OPENS : Dec. 25 in N.Y.C. and L.A. ; wide in Jan . <P> Shakespeare has caught a few breaks at the movies lately . Romeo and Juliet and Richard III became vigorous films that did honor to both the Bard and the medium . Now Julie Taymor , the magician who on Broadway turned The Lion King menagerie into masked enchanters on stilts , takes Shakespeare 's goriest play , Titus Andronicus , and makes it vivid , relevant and of elevating scariness . <P> A boy , his face hidden by a paper-bag helmet , plays an improvised war game with toy soldiers on his kitchen table . An explosion startles him , the room bursts into flames , and a giant totes him out of the late 20th century and into 1st century Rome . Hence , the action will take place in both ages . Imperial warriors , caked with the dust of conquest , tramp through the Coliseum like bulky action figures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of the past ; his rival , the emperor Saturninus ( Cumming ) , is pure oil of modern politician , oozing endearments and threats , riding through Rome in an open limo with a bubble top , seizing and betraying Titus ' daughter Lavinia ( Fraser ) . Tattoos abound , on the royal Goth captives led by Tamora ( Lange ) and on the Moor Aaron ( Lennix ) . A big band plays at Saturninus ' Saturnalia ; heavy metal accompanies the Goths . A tiger stalks the forest . <P> Taymor keeps the eye as busy as the ear ; she embellishes the story without disfiguring it . There 's room in her bestiary for fine performances , a pretty collision of histrionic styles . Cumming preens , Lennix schemes , Lange smolders . Then all cede to Hopkins , who , in the suitably grisly finale , serves up Titus as Hannibal Lecter with a noble vengeance . Rare and well done ! <P> Other movies this season have bigger stars , higher budgets , pricier effects , deeper tans . But if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an early clue to where film might go in its second century , your Christmas shopping can begin and end with this towering Titus . <P>  --  R.C.
