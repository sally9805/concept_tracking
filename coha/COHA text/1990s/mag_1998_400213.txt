GEARING UP I just got my Gear Guide ( March ) and am glad to see manufacturers finally giving attention to women 's gear , Karin Close Dayton , NV Twenty-five years ago is about when I started backpacking , and your " then and now " comparisons of old and new gear ( Gear Guide ) are misleading and in many cases incorrect . Younger readers probably believe you . Heck , they probably think we rubbed two sticks together to start fires , too . While there have been many innovations and revolutionary improvements the past 25 years , there was a lot of high-quality functional gear back then . Ed Norvaisis Beavercreek , OH MORE ON RAY 'S WAY I 'd like to make a clarification to The TRay Way ( February ) . Ray Jardine founded the American Long Distance Hiking Association-West , and not ALDHA ( Appalachian Long Distance Hiking Association ) , which is a separate organization . The focus of ALDHA-West is to " promote fellowship and communication among long-distance hikers and those who support long-distance hiking . " We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all long-distance trails . We publish " The Distance Hiker 's Gazette , " a quarterly newsletter written by and for long-distance hikers and also have a Web site ( http : //www.gorp.com/ nonprof/aldhaw ) , Although small in numbers , our " Gathering " each October offers two days of information , presentations , and fellowship . We also try to answer each and every inquiry . Contact us at : ALDHA-West , P.O. Box 651 , Vancouver , WA 98666 . Bob Turner Coordinator , ALDHA-West Coeur d'Alene , ID When Jardine tells the long-distance hiking community , " You 're doing it wrong , " his implicit claim is , " I know best what 's right for you . " Then he says he does n't understand why people get upset at his ideas . Maybe he should consider his attitude . O.D. Coyote Molalla , OR OH , TO BE IN ILLINOIS To my surprise and delight , someone finally has acknowledged the quiet splendor and beauty of Shawnee National Forest ( " A Trail of Two Rivers , " February ) . It certainly brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I yearn for the hills of the Shawnee and Lusk Creek Canyon . Growing up in Evansville , Indiana , it was only 80 miles to paradise , where I spent summers and winters backpacking the many trails . Steven R. Moorhead Eagle River , AK WEIGHTY MATTERS The February edition of The Basics ffi ( " The Oops Factor " ) states that the National Outdoor Leadership School " recommends that beginners pack no more than 40 percent of their body weight . " This sounds a little high . I typically hump 60-plus pounds when I go out and typically also bust my butt ( and brag about it later ) . However , I 'm much more comfortable carrying 35 to 40 pounds . If I were to attempt the 40 percent ratio , I 'd be carrying 78 pounds . Even if I were in fantastic shape , this would be a major chore . Joe Furey // Danville , CA There are as many theories on pack weight as there are sources to cite , and NOLS is certainly a reputable source for any backpacking-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 percent of body weight is on the high side of reasonable . It is also true that more experienced packers are likely to carry less weight than beginners , since they will know where they can cut corners without compromising safety or comfort . In the future we will recommend 30 percent of body weight as a more reasonable pack weight threshold , with 25 percent being ideal . - The Editors TENTS ON HIGH In your field test of single-wall tents ( " Tents From On High , " December 1997 ) there 's one from The North Face in the photo . Worthy enough for the testers , but not for a printed review ? James Roy Stamford , CT Author John Harlin responds : The tent was The North Face 's Tempest , which TNF markets as an " extreme high altitude tent . " Company representatives warned us that it would not perform up to standards at low elevation , where it breathes relatively poorly . We decided to look at the tent anyway in case TNF was selling itself short . It was n't . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we subjected the rest of the tents to that winter-conditions designed to reveal whether mountaineering-type single-walls could reasonably be used by the average mild-winter backpacker . Since TNF is explicit about who the tent is ideally suited for ( mountaineers ) , to be fair we chose not to include the Tempest in our head-to-head comparison . KEEPING IT WILD I would guess all of us who use wilderness , and/or find great importance in the concept , share some of Mr. Clark 's concern about its regulation ( Backcountry , October 1997 ) . Although " freedom " was not specifically legislated in the Wilderness Act of 1964 , it is certainly one of the primary values felt by many of us as we leave more urbanized existence behind . Preservation of that personal freedom has been a primary objective in the way Yosemite manages one of the most heavily used wilderness areas in the world . Rules such as the permit requirement are necessary to allow for public enjoyment while preserving not only the ecosystem , but the wilderness experience we all seek . Voluntary compliance , not outlaw-ism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My sincere thanks to all of your readers who help , rather than hinder , those of us trying to keep the wild in wilderness . Laurel Boyers Wilderness Manager Yosemite National Park , CA GETTING REAL Most of us who enjoy the outdoors also have jobs or school to deal with . I like reading about dream trips , but it 's refreshing when I see thought given to weekend people like me . William Beatty Colorado Springs , CO We also have a hard time squeezing in trips between driving kids to soccer practice , keeping the lawn mowed , and putting together this magazine . That 's why we 've devoted so much space to Weekend Wilderness destinations in this issue ( page 152 ) . We 're also planning a story on how real people with real jobs and obligations find time to get out more . Look for it in the June issue . - The Editors CORRECTIONS Our March 1998 issue contained an incorrect E-mail address for Kelty .
