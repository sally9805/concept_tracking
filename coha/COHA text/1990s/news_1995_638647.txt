<p> MISSION , Texas - Sonny Detmer sounds the horn in his pickup and " the girls , " loping through a clearing in the brush , come out to greet him . <p> They approach him warily , their moon-pie eyes looking for what he has brought . Sonny reaches into the truck bed for a handful of range cubes - square chunks of cottonseed meal and molasses . <p> He pitches the cubes to the ground and soon the mantra-like munching of six longhorn cows drowns out the drone of the underbrush life in this little corner of south Texas cattle country . <p> " There 's nothing more beautiful than a longhorn steer , " Sonny says , " and there 's nothing tougher than a longhorn cow , because of what she 's got to go through to raise her calves . " <p> He has staked 150 acres to support these six cows and their calves . They graze on what little they can extract from a stingy , unrelenting environment . <p> The sun is high enough and hot enough to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet blanket of humidity . <p> The ground , hard as concrete under a layer of fly-away dust , gives way only to the most vigorous forms of vegetation : mesquite trees , huisache bushes , black brush , thorn bushes and prickly-pear cactus among them . Of those , only the mesquites provide shade , and that only in patches under gangly limbs . <p> " I really like the longhorns because they 're so tough and hardy , " says Sonny , who owns 80 in all . " Other people get cattle and they get a drought and they ca n't feed them . Mine , they 're sort of making it on their own on that brush . " <p> Untempered toughness . Survival , even new life , in the face of stacked odds . These are the values Sonny Detmer cultivates and celebrates here in the harsh-reality landscape he paints as an underrated utopia . <p> His children , they know . No problem is too weighty , no obstacle too overwhelming , no shadow too darkly cast , no goal too lofty . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture the football jersey hangs on Koy Detmer , the third of Sonny and Betty 's four children , like an oversized coat on a wire hanger . Already grown to 6 feet , the starting , starring quarterback for the Mission High School football team weighed barely 160 pounds then . <p> But that right arm - the one shooting out , tendril-like , from under the jersey sleeve - he used to throw for 8,221 yards in his high-school career , enough to become the all-time passing leader in Texas . In the face of man-sized defenders , he performed with poise and grit . <p> " He 'd do cartwheels , he 'd get hit so hard , " Betty says . " He 'd roll over and get right back up . " <p> The picture hangs in a small trophy room at the Detmer home . Koy , who will start at quarterback for the University of Colorado this season , sleeps here during his visits , surrounded by a static yet storied display of success . <p> On one wall , pictures and awards comprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shelves hold dozens of trophies won by younger sister Lori , now 15 . Sonny , going on 28 years as a Texas high-school football coach , is the subject of one faded picture , a football tucked under his arm and a boyish grin perched on his face . <p> The grand-daddy of the display , though , sits on the floor , waiting for Betty to find enough time to create a showcase place for it . Camouflaged in a crowd of cumbersome college bowl trophies , it is close enough to the bed for Koy to stumble over it in the dark . <p> The 1990 Heisman Trophy - not so many years ago the coveted carrot at the end of one college player 's mouth-dropping , tongue-wagging season - is gathering south Texas dust . <p> The Heisman made the Detmer name famous and made Koy forever a target of comparison and ballooned expectation . Older brother Ty , a backup quarterback for the Green Bay Packers , won it while playing at Brigham Young University . Koy was the only member of the Detmer family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City . <p> " Sonny always had a rule : If you miss practice , you ca n't play . He ( Koy ) had his own excitement . Mission was in the state semifinals , " Betty says . " Besides that , Koy 's going to have his own chances to do things . " <p> When Koy was born , Ty was 6 years old and eager for a playmate and teammate ( not to slight sister Dee , born two years after Ty ) . <p> " Once , while I was pregnant , Ty came in and sat on my lap and said , ' I dreamed last night I had a little brother and we were out in the backyard , playing football , " ' Betty says . <p> The dream came true , on countless days and in countless back yards , front yards , fields , streets and driveways . Early on , Ty and his friends designated Koy a lineman , because that 's what little brothers play , and neighbors joked that Koy was hiking a football while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost like a practice every day , " Ty says . <p> From the beginning , the brothers mixed competition with camaraderie . Every new pastime brought a new twist and new test of who could run the fastest , throw the farthest , find the biggest worm , catch the biggest fish . <p> " Even now , when Ty and Koy meet , they do n't hug , they do n't shake hands . They usually square off and start wrestling , " Betty says . <p> When Koy was still very young , he and Ty and Sonny would play golf whenever weather and time allowed , Koy using a sawed-off 3-wood and putter . Once , when Koy and Sonny were paired against Ty and another family friend , Ty started needling Koy about being behind in the game . Koy simmered , then decided to settle it , right there on a tee box . <p> " Back then , Koy was real shy . If you tried to bug him about anything , he would cry , " Ty says . " I started him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided he had enough , he threw down his clubs and came after me . " <p> It took the progression of life to separate them , and then only by physical distance . They still talk two or three times a month . <p> " The first time Ty had a date , " says Doris , their grandmother , " he was getting ready and Koy was getting ready . When Ty was about to leave , he said , ' No , Koy , you ca n't go this time , ' and left him sitting slumped on the couch . Betty said she did n't know who was upset more - Ty or Koy . " <p> Koy spent CU 's spring break this year with Ty in Wisconsin , where the two hunted and fished - passions inherited from and nurtured by Sonny . In his coach 's office at Mission High School , Sonny has a snapshot of the three of them in hunting gear , Koy and Ty each with a deer shot for the Muy Grande Deer Contest in Freer , Texas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's was a 10-pointer with a 25 3/4-inch spread , and Koy 's was an 11-pointer with a 19 1/2-inch spread ) and that Ty won his division while Koy placed in the top three of the 14-and-under age group . <p> " Just the idea of competing all the time at something , " Koy says , " makes a guy a stronger competitor . " <p> Ty could show him how to wrap his hands around a football to throw a spiral , and Sonny could help him perfect it , but Koy had to summon his own competitive strength . <p> As Ty 's sidekick , he had only to match Ty 's strides and rise to Ty 's challenges . Ty made the decisions and gave the orders . Koy , meanwhile , harbored a reticence that continues to color his modest character . <p> " Ty talked for him when he was little . He would come to me and say , ' Koy wants something to drink . Koy wants this , Koy wants that . ' Ty was his manager , I guess you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the periphery , happy to hang on the edge of the huddle and to hunch his wispy frame in a lineman 's stance play after play . So when YMCA coaches pulled him aside in the second grade and asked him to play quarterback , he took it harder than any hard knock an opponent could deliver . He sat in Betty 's car after practice that day , head hanging and tears streaming . <p> " I asked him why he did n't want to do it . He said , ' Because they make you talk in the huddle , " ' she says . <p> He resisted the position change until the fifth grade , when tastes of his talent made coaches insist . Koy threatened to throw underhanded , but soon enough he relented and began whetting the expectations of watchful fans . <p> Meanwhile , Ty was feeding the fans and the state-record books at Southwest High in San Antonio , where Sonny was coaching . As Ty 's ball boy , Koy saw first-hand the grind of it all and the glory of it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did good , " Koy says . " I never looked at it as something I had to accomplish , too . <p> " He just kind of paved the way for me is the way I look at it . Just watching him do things made me think , ' Hey , I can do it . ' He did n't have someone to see do it first . I think I have an advantage there . I have a mark to beat . " <p> In less than two seasons of starting for Mission , Koy broke nearly every Texas high school record that Ty had set over three starting seasons . <p> " We 're awful proud of what Ty accomplished , " Sonny says , " but we may be prouder of Koy because he had to follow it . " <p> The town of Mission , 70 miles west of Brownsville and separated from Mexico by only a few miles and a shallow crossing on the Rio Grande , has a population of 28,653 , not counting the longhorns . <p> La Lomita Mission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed in Spanish-conqueror style , gives the town its name . **26;1159;TOOLONG , the same strain that infects every rural and urban artery of Texas every fall , gives the town its flavor . Koy , who led the Eagles to a second consecutive district title as a senior , gave the town a hero - second only to Tom Landry , who also played his high-school ball at Mission . <p> " One time when we were playing for the district championship , both teams were nine-and-oh . There were people lined up all along that fence , " Koy says , pointing to a chain-link fence beyond the south end zone at Mission 's Tom Landry Stadium . " You could n't see the fences . There were just people standing all over . " <p> Says Sonny : " I get a kick out of it . Ty will come down here and the kids will run right past him to get Koy 's autograph . He 's their boy down here . " <p> The Detmers moved to Mission during Koy 's freshman year of high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , apparently brought on by flu , held him out for much of his sophomore season . When he returned for his junior season , Koy had to battle a local player and community misconceptions for the starting position . <p> The two quarterbacks traded off quarters or halves through the first few games of the season while rumblings about Sonny merely wanting to start his own son grew into rumors and , at their worst , threats of drive-by shootings at games . <p> Koy answered all the accusations with one 80-yard drive against Pharr-San Juan Alamo . The Mission Eagles , who had dominated every opponent until that game , had less than two minutes to score the winning touchdown . It came at the end of the drive on a 20-yard pass from Koy to the tight end . <p> " I just wanted to win for the team . As long as the team was winning , that was fine with me , " Koy says . " I did n't feel any added pressure to prove to anybody that I was deserving . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof they needed . Koy led the Eagles all the way to the state semifinals in San Antonio 's Alamodome that season . They lost the game , but , Sonny says , getting there " was like winning the state championship or better . " <p> Koy committed to BYU midway through his junior season , ready to conquer the comparisons and to douse Provo in Detmer deja vu . But BYU soon signed John Walsh , and Koy decided he 'd have to go elsewhere . <p> That year , the Japan Bowl teamed Ty with former CU coach Bill McCartney . Ty so impressed McCartney that the coach asked if he had a younger brother . <p> The little brother , no longer a lineman and no longer mum in the huddle , made a visit and a quick decision : He would be a Buffalo . <p> Ty has n't been in the stands or on the sidelines to see Koy lead a team downfield since Koy 's seventh-grade year . Yet , elements of Ty were with him every yard of the way , in style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I kind of wanted to follow the things he had done and try to be like him , " Koy says . " I never tried to be better than him . " <p> The name " Ty " carried a clarion ring the first time Sonny heard it . It belonged to a local Texas player , but Sonny knew the instant it came off the announcer 's lips that it also would belong to his boy . He rolled it over his tongue and through his mind . Yes sir , that sure did sound good coming over a loudspeaker . Later , he felt the same about " Koy . " <p> Sonny 's birthday is Sept. 11 , same as Landry 's and Bear Bryant 's . His syrupy drawl is pure Texas , even though he spent his early years in Indiana after his family moved from his birthplace of Beaumont , Texas . His demeanor is down-home - as inviting as a sunny front porch , as soothing as a cool night on the south Texas border . His passion is austere . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four hours , " Ty says . " He stands there watching the cows and blends right into the fenceposts . He 's always thinking about something , whether it 's cows or football . " <p> Much like his sons , Sonny as a young man had a slight stature . Yet at age 16 he signed with Wharton County Junior College , 60 miles west of Houston , to play point guard and center field . There , he met Betty . <p> " He was an athlete . I was always in the stands , " Betty says . " It 's never changed . I 'm still sitting in the stands . " <p> Sonny spent a year at Florida State playing baseball , then returned to his native state to finish his college years at Southwest Texas , where he also played receiver for the football team . <p> After graduation , he played two seasons with the Continental Football League team in San Antonio . In 1968 , he was steered to his first high school coaching job , at South San Antonio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I really planned on being a coach . It just happened , " Sonny says , " and I 've never wanted to get out of it . " <p> He 's paced in front of numerous packed stadiums across the state , coaching at eight schools in Texas and one in Arizona . At almost every stop , he 's stirred the town with the ultimate in Texas sports success - teams playing in the postseason . <p> The one year Sonny spent in Laredo brought Laredo-Martin its first district championship in 26 years . A family friend told Doris after that season : " They do n't think Sonny 's a great football coach down there ( in Laredo ) . They think he 's God . " <p> At home , Koy and Ty remember Sonny not as a deity , not as a coach , but rather as a dad . The coachspeak , as well as the formations and ruminations , he left on the field . <p> " The only time I heard about football at home , " Ty says , " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would listen to those and watch game film . I thought it was fun watching ( players on film ) running backward when they 'd rewind . " <p> Even now , when Sonny talks to his sons or when they talk to each other , football is n't foremost . The Detmers spend their long-distance dollars on discourse about fishing holes . <p> A cow poker rests in the gun rack of Sonny 's 1986 GMC truck , a cowboy hat rests on his head . The dust from a road outside town swirls in the cab . Sonny talks over the engine rumble , once again about longhorns . This friend he 's going to visit , he says , has one of the best calves he 's ever seen . <p> Coach Sonny Detmer 's offense produces some of the most gaudy passing statistics the state of Texas has ever seen . It 's an open offense , invented in Sonny 's mind and perfected in Ty 's and Koy 's performance . <p> " Genetically , they understood my offense , " Sonny says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " even though at 6-foot-1 , 185 pounds , he 's not pro quarterback size . But then , neither was Ty , and coaches constantly gushed over his attributes , much like Sonny does with a good calf . <p> His friend 's calf is midnight black , but that 's not all Sonny sees . He points out the generous horn base , the hip level , the bone width . He thinks he might be able to talk his friend into letting him have this one . <p> " He 's probably not good enough to show . But he 's got good genes , " he says . " If it 's in the bloodlines , it 'll turn up . " <p> No doubt about that .
