Millions of snow geese invade the marshes around Hudson Bay each spring , turning healthy tundra into a biological wasteland. // The race to save a fragile tundra ecosystem from ravenous geese ON THE PRAIRIES OF NORTH Dakota , what appear to be huge , feathered storm clouds move from wheat field to wheat field . Flocks of lesser snow geese , sometimes numbering in the tens of thousands , descend on croplands , spiraling to earth to scour the dirt for any spilled grain . To the casual observer , such abundance is a mesmerizing spectacle of nature 's bounty . To someone who has set foot on the birds ' tundra breeding grounds , however , the sight portends something far more sinister . The number of snow geese that winter in the central U.S. and then head north to Canada is now estimated at more than 3 million-triple the number of the late ' 60s-and the increase is stressing the fragile ecosystem around Hudson Bay to the point of ecological breakdown . " We 've reached a critical juncture , " says Ducks Unlimited 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has witnessed firsthand the awesome devastation wrought by the huge flocks of geese . " If we do n't bring these populations under control soon , nature will do the job for us . " The problem , however , is that if we wait too long for a population crash , the birds will further-and perhaps permanently destroy their nesting areas , which are also vital to Canada geese and myriad other species of migratory birds . During the spring migration , much of the mid-continent population of lesser snow geese is found in a thin , 1,200-mile-long strip of coastal marsh that rims Hudson Bay . Within this staging area , scientists have identified 130,000 acres of prime breeding and feeding habitat on the south and west coasts of Hudson and James bays . Already , the geese have completely denuded some 50,000 acres of this territory . Another 30,000 acres have been damaged but can be salvaged if populations are brought under control . As the number of birds continues to grow , the stress on an already weakened ecosystem increases proportionally . In spring , before there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed by grubbing tubers out of the soft tundra earth , removing the plant , roots and all . Where once there was lush tundra , there are now extensive mud flats , devoid of vegetation . Once the plant cover is removed , salt leaches upward from the earth beneath , raising the soil salinity-often to three times that found in ocean water . Alkali deposits stain many areas along the bay , telltale signs of the widespread destruction . The geese are , in essence , turning the landscape into a biological desert , and scientists still do n't know whether the region can recover . One area similarly devastated by lesser snow geese more than a decade ago , but protected by an enclosure fence since then , shows no hint of recovering . At the crux of the dilemma is the survival rate of adult snow geese . Unwittingly , grain farmers have contributed to the problem by providing the geese with additional crop fields in which to feed . The birds now find an abundance of food along much of their migratory corridor , which stretches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corn in the Midwest and rice in Texas and Louisiana . Such high-energy foods allow the birds to gain weight , which makes them more likely to successfully reach their ancestral breeding grounds . Despite the fact that wildlife managers have liberalized snow geese bag limits and season lengths , the number of lesser snows taken by hunters has actually declinedeven as bird numbers continue to climb . Because the birds travel in enormous flocks , they are difficult to decoy , and unlike their Canada goose brethren , they are not easy to pattern . While Canada geese commonly return to feed in the field in which they fed the day before , snows continually search out new venues , often foiling even the most diligent waterfowlers . For the first time in history , waterfowl managers are faced with the problem of too many birds , and as the paradigms change , so must the search for solutions . " We 're looking at several innovative ways in which the birds might be brought under control , " says Dr. Batt . Among the approaches being considered is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live decoys . The fact that market-hunting methods once considered taboo by sportsmen have resurfaced as ways to reduce snow goose populations underscores the problem 's severity . " Once these habitats are gone , " says Dr. Batt , " they could effectively be lost forever .
