St. Martin 's Press is determined to show the veracity of the old chestnut about why people who live in glass houses should n't throw stones . The publisher is rushing out 500,000 copies of an " instant " paperback book , Glass Houses : Shocking Profiles of Congressional Sex Scandals and Other Unofficial Misconduct by attorney Stanley Hilton and psychologist Anne-Renee Testa , due in stores by Election Day . The book 's mission : to expose the hidden lives of some of those who will be judging President CLINTON . The book will review the ethical problems of more than 50 Senators and Congressional Representatives . <P> Glass Houses grew out of a three-year investigation by Hilton , who used to work on Bob Dole 's Senate staff . ( Kenneth Starr was two years ahead of him at Duke Law School . ) Hilton interviewed 150 Congressional staffers and 35 lobbyists . Why does he think Congressmen point fingers when they have secrets of their own ? " It 's a form of grandiosity , " says Hilton . " They tend to think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an angry Congressman might sue him after the book comes out ? Nah : " Truth is a defense . " Besides , he adds , " I 'm a litigator .
