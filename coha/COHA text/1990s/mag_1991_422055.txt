Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS <p> Dateline : Washington <p> The Thomas confirmation hearings reveal little about the nominee  --  but a lot about a ritual process that 's become a caricature of itself <p> Just imagine what the Soviets must have thought if they were watching the Clarence Thomas hearings on CNN last week . <p> Behold ! In the crucible of the Capitol , in the marbled splendor of the Senate Caucus Room , was the world 's oldest democracy in action , weighing who in the land should sit on the U.S. Supreme Court . Here is what a free people seemed to get for their faith in their government : an evasive , overcoached nominee ; a cynical , manipulative White House ; a windy collection of senators . And in the corridors just outside the hearing room were platoons of interest groups eager to characterize what Thomas was saying before he even said it ; there have n't been so many spin cycles since the last Maytag convention . It was not exactly a glorious display of the American political process , notwithstanding how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better  --  and worst-part of the four days of confirmation hearings last week , Clarence Thomas did all he could to disavow every controversial position he 's ever taken . On abortion , on affirmative action , on natural law-no speech or article was sufficiently tame not to repudiate . He did n't read it , he did n't mean it , he would n't do it as a judge . On a few matters , such as church-state relations and gender discrimination , Thomas committed himself in broad strokes to a centrist position . But on the question of Roe v. Wade , the 1973 court decision creating a constitutional right to abortion , Thomas went so far as to say that he had never discussed the case with anyone , even in private . " I ca n't imagine any lawyer in the last 17 years having no opinion on Roe , " <p> All along , the administration maintained publicly that its nominee to the high court was the best man for the job and was selected for nonracial reasons . The latter claim , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge privately what is clear circumstantially : picking a black conservative with a rags-torobes life story was a political bonus . The former claim is undercut by the fact that Thomas was n't even the runner-up in 1990 , when David Souter was nominated . The American Bar Association last month gave Thomas its lowest approval rating , in part because of his lack of judicial experience . His unfamiliarity with constitutional law was highlighted last Friday when Leahy asked him to name " a handful of the most important cases " decided by the court since he entered law school in 1971 . After a long pause , Thomas mentioned only Roe and one other case . Leahy repeated the question twice , but Thomas came up empty . <p> Despite Leahy 's foray , most senators were a study in docility . Except for the prosecutorial Arlen Specter , the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee saw themselves as speechifying cheerleaders for the nominee . Orrin Hatch asked Thomas this mind twister : " When you become a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court , do you intend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , Alan Simpson did n't bother with questions ; on Wednesday he went on for 15 minutes seemingly without even indicating where one sentence stopped and the next one began . <p> The Democrats promised better . Ever since Thomas was named , they warned that this time they would n't let a nominee slide by without answering specific questions about abortion and the right to privacy . They said they had learned their lesson over the past five years by confirming Antonin Scalia , Anthony Kennedy and Souter  --  only to see reticent nominees become Hard Right loyalists on the high court . The result ? Some senators certainly have pressed Thomas . Joe Biden of Delaware scolded him , calling one answer " the most unartful dodge I have heard . " No one , though , would confuse any of the interrogators with Perry Mason . And nothing close to a committee majority has indicated that Thomas 's evasiveness would cost him when it comes down to a vote ; Thomas is expected to win committee approval by a 9-5 or 10-4 vote . With that lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence whom the White House nominates for the court in the future . <p> Much of the hypocrisy from the Senate , the White House and Thomas himself is based on a set of myths about the confirmation process that were trotted out yet again last week : Answering questions about current issues compromises a nominee 's impartiality . Thomas has used this bromide to avoid discussing Roe just as Thurgood Marshall did at his confirmation hearings 24 years ago , when he was asked by conservatives about Miranda warnings ) . Even Thomas 's toughest questioner , Sen. Howard Metzenbaum , insisted ( unpersuasively ) that his questions were merely about privacy and not a specific case . The platitude has visceral appeal ; after all , judges would n't seem able to rule fairly on matters they 've already worked out . The fallacy , though , is that nominees presumably have thought about the vital constitutional issues of the day . ( If they have n't , it suggests they 've been practicing law on Neptune . ) Why are those ruminations less prejudicial simply because they remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Justices Harry Blackmun or Scalia , who already have taken extreme , opposite positions on the viability of Roe ? Should they be required to recuse themselves from future abortion cases ? The truth is that nominees refuse to answer controversial questions because they 're concerned about hurting their confirmation chances , not their veneer of impartiality . A nominee 's personal views have nothing to do with his or her constitutional philosophy . Thomas refused last week to divulge even nonlegal opinions on abortion . He said such views were " irrelevant " to any court decisions he would reach . While that sounds great , the days are long past since we believed jurists were special beings endowed with the power to reach into the sky and pull out neutral principles to resolve disputes . Seventy years ago , Benjamin Cardozo , later to become a justice , put it well . Judges " do not stand aloof on these chill and distant heights , " he wrote , " and we shall not help the cause of truth by acting and speaking as if they do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day O'Connor said she personally opposed abortion . There is a presumption in favor of the president 's pick . This , obviously , is the view of all presidents . But it has support in neither the text of the Constitution nor the words of its authors . The purpose of the Senate 's " advice and consent " role is to act as a cheek on the chief executive , not simply ratify his choice based on a review of credentials . In the modern era , the test has become whether the nominee is woefully incompetent ( G. Harrold Carswell , rejected in 1970 ) or way out of the philosophical mainstream ( Robert Bork , rejected in 1987 ) . <p> Do n't worry . You never can tell what kind of justice you 'll wind up getting . Thomas 's supporters have tried to show their man has a libertarian streak and could wind up voting with the court 's liberals ( both of them ) sometimes . True enough , even Scalia is n't a robot ; for example , he voted in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presidents typically get what they want . Their justices are their legacy . All five appointed by Ronald Reagan and George Bush have been consistently conservative . <p> Politics is a dirty word . The process of filling Supreme Court vacancies surely contemplates politics : cajoling , calculating , counting Senate heads . That 's why the two dominantly political branches were given the joint power to pick justices . Politics can produce consensus , compromise and even wise policy on occasion . But before the Bork summer of 1987 , confirmation hearings rarely resulted in the sideshow we now take for granted . " The process is n't working well , " Sen. Herbert Kohl , a Democrat , told NEWSWEEK . Because the nominee prepares so long with politicians rather than scholars , " We are almost assured of getting a less-than-totally candid performance . " Hatch laments the process , too , but blames " Single-issue politics , " meaning abortion . <p> Both explanations ring true , but neither is complete . The problem is perception : What is the Supreme Court about ? In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stature of nominees and the prestige of the court as the principled branch of government . A Cardozo was n't required , but some distinction and diversity in public life or academe or the judiciary was usually a prerequisite . Today , ideology drives all actors in the process , and it usually takes us down the low road . Until that changes , confirmation hearings like Thomas 's will remain a September charade .
