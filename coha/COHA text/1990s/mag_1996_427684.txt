Is the End Near for the NRA ? <p> This year , election day handed the National Rifle Association a striking series of defeats . The 10 senators and congressmen it fought hardest to replace all held onto their seats . Meanwhile , eight of 10 legislators who gun-control advocates considered the NRA 's staunchest allies in Congress lost their races . So complete was the NRA 's Election Day humiliation that of the 38 challengers to House incumbents it supported this year , not one managed to win . Not only were the organization 's various campaigns ineffective , they were also expensive , costing the NRA more than $5 million  --  about the same amount it spent in 1994 , when many of its candidates swept to power on Newt Gingrich 's coattails . <p> If anything , support from the gun lobby this year hurt those candidates who tied themselves too closely to the NRA 's extremist policies . Take Al Salvi , the radical-right Illinois Republican Senate candidate who was handpicked by gun activists to run for Paul Simon 's seat . For months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he did to downplay his gun stance , he could not shake the label of " poster boy for the NRA . " Finally , in his campaign 's closing days , Salvi lashed out . His target : Jim Brady , the gun-control crusader who was wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt against President Ronald Reagan . Brady was , Salvi said , " a licensed machine-gun dealer before he was shot . " <p> Salvi 's Twilight Zone-like performance caused an uproar during the last weekend of the campaign . Brady called a news conference and mocked the charge . Salvi tried to apologize and retract his charge , but it was too late . His opponent , Rep. Dick Durbin , a strong backer of gun control , ran a campaign commercial that featured Jim and Sarah Brady ; Durbin called Salvi 's remarks " shameless " and waltzed to a landslide , 56 percent to 41 percent victory on Election Day . <p> Salvi 's defeat was a crushing blow to the NRA , which had designated his race as a must-win battle . All across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , backing him with $9,900 in direct campaign contributions and spending another $60,000 on targeted radio advertising and direct mail on his behalf , in addition to $53,000 spent helping him win the GOP nomination . <p> Salvi 's loss was one tile in a nationwide mosaic of defeat for the NRA this year . Hoping to repeat its wildly successful run of 1994 , when it spent $5.3 million to help elect dozens of pro-gun Republican freshmen , the NRA once again lavished more than $5 million in contributions and advertising on its favored candidates , with hundreds of thousands of dollars more going for postcard mailings and phone banks in the last weeks before Election Day . Unlike 1994 , this year was an almost unbroken string of disasters for the gun lobby  --  especially in races where guns were an issue . The result will be a White House committed to expanded gun-control measures and a Congress that is far less likely to pay attention to the NRA 's lobbyists . <p> " The main outcome , particularly in the House , " says Kristen Rand of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a prayer of forcing the Republicans to do things like trying to repeal the assault-weapons ban  --  where they know better , but they 've been afraid of the NRA 's political clout . They 'll see that the emperor has no clothes . " <p> The NRA , mired in a deep financial crisis while its membership shrinks , does not need another problem right now . The NRA 's losses this year will be Topic No. 1 when , as expected , the NRA executive council meets in December , and heads could roll . Wayne LaPierre , the NRA 's executive vice president , is likely to be ousted . NRA insiders say that the organization 's board and executive council could place the blame for the NRA 's disastrous situation where it belongs : squarely on the shoulders of Tanya Metaksa , head of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action , and her chief backer , First Vice President Neal Knox . <p> All year long , the NRA was swimming not only against the tide but against a tidal wave of anti-gun voter opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NRA . The most telling evidence of the NRA 's impotence this year : In the November-December issue of American Rifleman , an NRA monthly , the NRA identified a group of senators and representatives as the 10 Who Got ta Go . Not a single one went . Those targeted included , in Senate races , Paul Wellstone of Minnesota , Max Baucus of Montana and Tom Harkin of Iowa  --  all incumbents challenged by pro-gun Republicans  --  and Durbin in Illinois . All won handily . Among the six members of the House who were targeted by the NRA was David Bonior of Michigan 's 10th District , a House Democratic leader . The NRA endorsed his opponent and poured nearly $40,000 into the race in his district , north of Detroit , but failed . In contrast , Handgun Control Inc. , a group chaired by Sarah Brady , targeted 12 NRA-backed candidates , which Handgun Control Inc. called the Dangerous Dozen . Of those , 10 went down in defeat , a stunning record in a year when most incumbents , from the president on down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are : <p> Daniel Frisa , the congressman from New York 's Long Island who was backed by the NRA and lost in a stunning upset to Carolyn McCarthy , whose husband was killed by a gun-wielding lunatic on the Long Island Rail Road three years ago . McCarthy made the ban on assault weapons  --  which Frisa voted to repeal last spring  --  the centerpiece of her campaign . The McCarthy race drew national attention to gun control and was one of Handgun Control Inc. ' s top priorities . <p> Harold Volkmer , a Missouri Democrat and 20-year veteran of the House who led the opposition to the Brady Bill three times  --  in 1988 , 1991 and 1993  --  and authored a landmark 1986 law that weakened the Gun Control Act of 1968 . " This is a huge , huge blow to the NRA , " says Rand . " It has got to be in shock . He is the most long-standing , reliable advocate it had in the House . " <p> Key freshmen who voted to repeal the assault-weapons ban last March like Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Longley of Maine and Andrea Seastrand of California . All are Republicans , and all lost . <p> " We ran ads against two-term Ohio Congressman Martin Hoke and Andrea Seastrand , and we took election-eve polls to see whether this issue was working  --  and it was , " says Bob Walker , legislative director for Handgun Control Inc . " Where this issue played out , where it was a big issue in the campaign , we did exceedingly well . " <p> More broadly , the NRA failed almost completely in the House . For instance , the NRA backed 38 challengers to House incumbents in 1996 , and all 38 ( including the likely outcomes of several Texas races in runoffs scheduled for December ) lost . In some of those , the NRA poured tens of thousands of dollars in vain into a single race to topple a key anti-gun Democrat like Bonior . In California 's 3rd District , the NRA spent more than $57,000 attempting to unseat nine-term incumbent Vic Fazio and contributed $4,950 directly to Tim LeFever , Fazio 's opponent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigns , spending $42,000 on ads for Rep. Dick Chrysler of Michigan , $44,000 for David Funderburk of North Carolina and $63,000 for Randy Tate of Washington , all GOP freshmen . In keeping with its stealthy style , the NRA 's ads often did n't mention guns at all . <p> In all , the NRA endorsed 283 House candidates  --  out of a possible 435  --  and managed to back winners by supporting many incumbents and a handful of strong candidates in open-seat races . " We were up against Clinton , the unions , the environmentalists and Emily 's List a group that gives money to Democratic , pro-choice female candidates , " Metaksa said on <p> C-SPAN , spinning like mad . " There were casualties , but the Hill was n't taken . It could have been better , but I think we did very well . " Yet Metaksa has to look hard to find bright spots for the NRA . One , certainly , is Kansas , where NRA-backed candidates won both Senate seats and the four House seats ; the victors were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Smith squeaked by with NRA support in a close race . Other NRA-backed winners include Senate candidates in Maine , Alabama and Colorado , along with longtime NRA veterans like Sens . Phil Gramm of Texas , Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Larry Craig of Idaho . But those wins , predictable as they were , are balanced by losses in Senate races in Nebraska , South Dakota , Georgia and New Jersey  --  where Democrat Bob Torricelli , long one of the NRA 's betes noires , hammered away during the closing weeks of the campaign at his opponent 's mixed record on guns . <p> A symbol of what a frustrating year it was for the NRA was the down-to-the-wire Senate contest in Louisiana . In September the NRA mobilized , along with other conservative groups , to help a far-right Republican , Woody Jenkins , win a chance to be the GOP 's standard-bearer against Democrat Mary Landrieu , who supports the Brady Bill and the ban on assault weapons . Jenkins , who 's close with Oliver North ( in the ' 80s , Jenkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backing the Nicaraguan rebels during the CIA-sponsored war ) , received the benefit of more than $130,000 in independent expenditures from the NRA , a greater amount than the NRA spent on any other House or Senate candidate . Blanketing the state with radio ads , the NRA accused Landrieu of being soft on crime and " helping to win parole for a man who had stabbed his wife to death . " Landrieu , however , eked out a win , with barely more than 50 percent of the vote . <p> In the end , the NRA 's biggest disaster was its total irrelevance in the presidential race . Seething at Clinton , the NRA was paralyzed when Bob Dole refused to support its position on repealing the ban on assault weapons . In a fit of pique , the NRA 's Knox and Metaksa refused to endorse Dole . But that step , taken to placate radical gun-rights activists who would abandon the NRA for even more militant groups such as Gun Owners of America , disheartened the NRA 's pragmatists and depressed voter turnout among NRA members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at political windmills since 1992 , during which time Clinton was elected twice , and Congress passed both the Brady Bill and the ban on assault weapons , the NRA has now spent itself almost into receivership with little to show for its effort . <p> By By Robert Dreyfuss <p> <p> Robert Dreyfuss wrote about the travails of the NRA , in RS 746 . <p>
