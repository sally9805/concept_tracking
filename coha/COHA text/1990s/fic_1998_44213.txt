It was Friday night and Alex Fader lay on his mother 's bed , watching television with glassy eyes while his mother sat in the kitchen reading , or talking on the phone , or doing whatever it was she did in the kitchen while he watched television . He secretly suspected that what she was doing was giving him the privacy to watch television alone , which made the use he put this privacy to even more unsettling . As II:3o approached , his pulse began to quicken . When it arrived he turned down the volume and changed the channel . <p> At the age of thirteen Alex was hit by the twin lightning bolts of sex and religion , two previously unrelated subjects that came crashing into his life simultaneously , as though holding hands . It was when he was thirteen that cable television was installed in his home , and Bar Mitzvah season commenced . <p> II:30 on Friday night was when a program called Ugly George aired for half an hour on channel J. Ugly George was a television show about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very simple and yet never lost its suspense from one show to the next . The opening scene would invariably be a shot of a busy street somewhere in the city . The camera was mounted on Ugly George 's shoulder as he strolled along , pointing his camera this way and that while he described the scene for his viewers in the sing song voice one might use to read a bedtime story . This introductory segment was the equivalent to a magician showing the audience that the top hat was empty , before reaching in and producing a rabbit . Ugly George was showing his viewers that this was the real world , the same sort of crowded street they might have walked down the other day , looking at faces , making tiny judgments about people , having fleeting moments of lust , and proceeding on without anything eventful happening . Ugly George , on the other hand , possessed the ability to make things happen . <p> Alex did not . He had experimented with petty forms of vandalism and theft , as well as belligerent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his own audacity moments after he made them , as though he had been momentarily possessed by some strange demon . Yet everyday circumstances continued to sweep him along , diverting his plans and wishes , impervious to his efforts to change his own life . He had been planning to do something about his crush on Tania Vincent , for example , and yet had hardly been able to meet her eyes . He felt like a captain who drew up elaborate navigational plans for his ship , only to discover anew that the wind and waves would dictate his path , and nothing else . <p> For Ugly George , the sailing was not smooth , but the direction was clear . If a young woman walked by , Ugly George would point his camera at her and begin talking . He was cordial and polite , but he got to the point fairly quickly . The point was : would the woman care to duck into an alley , or a rest room , or some nook and cranny of the city that Ugly George was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera , and a large portion of the subscribers to Manhattan Cable , her breasts . <p> The Ugly George show was an anthology of rejection . The styles were as varied as the women . But every now and then a woman said Yes . The amateurism of the footage and the awkwardness with which the whole thing progressed added to its intensity and its immediacy . There was no airbrushing here , no poses and props like in dirty magazines , just this strange voluntary gesture of a woman exposing herself to a man with a camera , usually after considerable coaxing . Alex watched the Ugly George Show in a state of extreme excitement and agitation , because all this visual delight had to be experienced with his mother sitting in the kitchen at the end of the hallway , in her slippers and robe . His Friday night bedtime was midnight . The floor of the hallway was carpeted . And though Alex had developed a hypersensitive device in his ear to detect his mother 's footsteps in the hall , all the erotic stimulation of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her arrival . <p> He watched now crouched in the small space between the television and the foot of her bed , arm outstretched , with his hand on the cable box dial , ready to spin to another channel at the first sound of her steps . This was the position he maintained for the entire half hour duration of the show . <p> Ugly George explained that he had gone to the Auto Show to see what he could find . He found the latest cars from Detroit and Japan , as well as hot rods , and drag racers , and men demonstrating incredibly sharp kitchen knives that would stay sharp no matter what you did to them . Scantily clad woman stood on platforms next to the cars like gigantic live hood ornaments . Ugly George approached one after the other . <p> " Excuse me ! " he called out pathetically . " Excuse me ma 'm can I talk to you a moment ? " He was ignored . Or he was told , " I 'm busy . " Or , " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ford , Chrysler , and General Motors told Ugly George to get lost . There had never been an entirely fruitless Ugly George program but it was now II:SO , ten minutes until his bed time , and things were looking bleak . Then an attractive woman standing next to a car with a lot of chrome started paying attention to what Ugly George had to say . She listened to him with a serious expression . <p> " I get a break in twenty minutes , " she said . <p> Suddenly she was standing on a dark staircase and talking about her modeling career . The bright light on top of the camera gave her face a pale , washed out quality . Ugly George told her that many women have had their careers launched on his show . While she spoke a hand appeared in the lower corner of the screen , and tugged gently at her spandex top . " Could you pull this down a little ? " he asked . <p> She pulled it down , showing more cleavage , and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked a little confused by the bright light . <p> " Yes , that 's great , " said Ugly George . " Great . " Then the hand reappeared at the bottom of the screen . Ugly George was persistent . His hand was like a pale moth that kept flitting back to the bright light of her breast . " You know what would be ideal ? " he said . Her face responded coolly to the suggestion . " You want me to take it all the way off ? " The hand reached out and gave a gentle tug . She cooperated . Two breasts popped out . Alex and half the adolescent male population of Manhattan let out a silent , heart thumping cheer . Unfortunately the palpitations of his heart were echoed by his mother 's footsteps thudding gently in the hall . He spun the television dial and threw himself back onto her bed . The spin was as arbitrary as roulette . <p> Alex 's mother often walked in on her son watching strange programs . Cooking shows . News specials . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits of God , and the perils of sin . He made exaggerated gestures with his arms and punctuated his sentences with long meaningful stares into the camera . Alex stared at him with the same blank enrapt expression he always had when he watched television . She watched this for a while , standing next to the bed . Finally she turned to him and asked , " Does this interest you ? " <p> " Sort of , " he mumbled . " It was just on . " <p> This exchange depressed him far more than abandoning the beautiful woman and her breasts . The real business of his life was , more and more , conducted on a subterranean level , out of his mother 's sight , and he felt a pang of sadness and pity for her now , as she puzzled over this strange new fragment like an archeologist who has found yet another incongruous item on her dig . <p> " This is a mistake , " he wanted to explain . " This guy talking about Jesus is a fluke . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw any conclusions from it . " But this explanation would have to lead to other , impossible explanations , and so he just kept quiet , and suffered through five minutes of the preacher vehemently insisting that Jesus Christ loved both Alex and his mother , and that Jesus will save them both if only they let Him into their heart . Then it was time for bed . <p> The next morning Alex stood still while his mother helped him with his tie . She tugged at the knot , tightening it , and he pretended to be having an out of body experience , so as to not be so close to her face . His father had not lived long enough to teach Alex how to knot a tie properly , and his mother was n't too good at it either , so they made it a perennial joint enterprise , a shared task of pulling and tugging until they got it right . Alex felt he could do it on his own at this point , but was n't quite ready to deprive his mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was on his way to Phil Singer 's Bar Mitzvah . Under his arm was a gift wrapped copy of Great jews in Sports . In a rare moment of foresight , Alex had fished ten copies of this book out of a discount bin and had them gift wrapped , thereby resolving the Bar Mitzvah gift problem . They sat in an ever shrinking stack in his room . <p> " Let me get your scarf , " his mother said as he headed for the door , " because it 's cold . " She went and got him his scarf . He could picture all her movements by the sounds of her footsteps through the apartment , receding and then approaching again , hurried and purposeful . She handed him the scarf . " Have a wonderful time , " she said . <p> He glared at her because of the word wonderful , which was a typical word for his mother . It was impractical and romantic and strange . Furthermore it was too dignified . There was something barbaric about these Bar Mitzvahs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity existed within each individual eighth grader was submerged , and they became one pulsating headless group of stimulation seekers , constantly seeking out new life forms to devour . Bar Mitzvahs were like petri dishes in which the germs that comprised his class were allowed to commingle and multiply . <p> Today 's Bar Mitzvah boy , Phil Singer , was the coolest person in the grade and , amazingly , someone Alex felt close to , but he did not think wonderful was the word for what lay in store . <p> " I 'm not going to have a wonderful time , " said Alex stoically . " I may have a good time . And that 's a maybe . " <p> " All right , " she said . " Then have a good time . Have whatever time you want to have . " <p> He stood in the small vestibule outside their apartment , and she stood in the doorway while the elevator came . <p> " You look very handsome , " she said , smiling , as though she knew she should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist . There she goes again , he thought . Handsome . What kind of word was that ? When a girl at school liked another boy , she called him cute . But then did he want his mother to call him cute ? The thought was disturbing . He was rescued by the elevator . <p> " Good-bye , " he said . The elevator door closed and he kept his eyes glued to his mother 's until the door itself interrupted the sight . It was only in this last second , as his mother stood there in the doorway to the apartment smiling at him and meeting his gaze , that his feelings of contempt and disgust for her abated , and were replaced by a wrenching and overwhelming sensation of love . Then he was enclosed by the fake wood paneling , descending in what he had come to feel was the world 's slowest elevator , a tiny decompression chamber between his home and the real world . <p> He took a taxi to the Park Avenue Synagogue , which in spite of its name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of boys on the sidewalk standing around talking in their gray three piece suits . Gerstein , Conroy , Fluss , Edleman , and Cohen . They sounded like a law firm and all except for Gerstein would eventually graduate from law school . Gerstein was a cynical and manipulative creep who had been popular and attractive ever since he stood up in the sandbox . These waning months of eighth grade would be the last uncomplicated and happy months of his life ; soon the world would get complicated , and he would be unable to get complicated with it . Someone racing up Madison in a taxi might have mistaken this group for a bunch of brash young executives , but Alex recognized them as a bunch of leering and belligerent adolescents , spoiled brats , and , he had to admit , the sorry group of humans he spent a lot of his time with . Alex had by now witnessed Rabbis manhood . Gerstein , Edleman , and Fluss had already had theirs . The transformation was not evident . Alex joined the group . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good friend . " Do you wear the same underwear to every Bar Mitzvah too ? " <p> " Nice face , " Alex replied , and immediately marveled at his inability to say anything insulting to anyone else , while , on the other hand , every insult directed at him was like a radioactive thorn that leaked poison into his system for hours if not weeks after it was inserted . Already he felt a tiny vibration of hatred toward his mother for having bought him this stupid blue blazer and gray slacks . At least , he reflected , Gerstein had not called him fat . He was not even that fat anymore , but he had been when he first arrived at the school in fourth grade , and had continued to be for several years , and now he was like a character actor who is not allowed to change his character-fat . <p> " Today is going to be good , " said Cohen . " The Plaza . " <p> " Singer is a maniac , " said Fluss . <p> " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I hope it 's better than a little cup that says , ' Arnold 's Bar Mitzvah ' on it , " said Fluss , referring to Gerstein , s Bar Mitzvah gift a month earlier . <p> " I wonder if Singer will be wasted when he reads from the Torah , " said Cohen . <p> " Scott would be so pissed if Singer messed up , " said Fluss . Scott was Phil Singer 's father . <p> " Scott ! " said Edleman . <p> " Scott ! " replied Fluss , as though responding to a mating call . " Scott Scott Scott Scott ! " he continued . All the boys started bleating the name Scott . They sounded like honking geese . Alex joined in meekly . It was the strange custom of all of Alex 's classmates to refer to their own and everyone else 's father by their first names . The mention of one of these names sent all his friends into peals of ecstatic laughter , as though it were the most ridiculous thing they had ever heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine taking any pleasure in referring to him as " Sol " and in chanting his name derisively with them . <p> When the chanting subsided , the boys turned to go inside . The Park Avenue Synagogue , on 88th and Madison , was just three blocks south of Alex 's barber shop , Michael 's , and Alex suddenly thought of it . Michael 's specialized in children . It had been founded sometime during the Kennedy administration and its interior design had not been revised since . The walls were covered with pictures of the Kennedy kids sporting a haircut called " The John-John . " The chairs were large imperial contraptions made of white porcelain and red leather that went up and down , and some of them had little toy cars , orange and green , built around them , for the youngest children , which gave the place a carnival atmosphere . Every kid got a Tootsie Pop while his hair was cut . There was a small room in the back where particularly distressed children were taken , so their screams and wails would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor to this back room when he was very young . He remembered the cooing sounds of the barber , his mother 's hand caressing him , and the shrill snip snip of the scissors next to his ear . Above all , as he entered the cool interior of the Park Avenue Synagogue , he remembered his own screams . A bloody corpse could not have provoked more hysterical cries of distress . <p> Why had he screamed like that ? Now , at age thirteen , it was a mystery to him . Already a small pool of his own humanity had slipped forever beyond his reach , locked under a pane of glass through which he could only peer , as though he were looking at an exhibit at a museum . He no longer cried in the Michael 's barbershop . But then , it occurred to him , he rarely went . His hair was long and unruly . There had been a palace coup on the subject of hair styles a couple of years before , and The John-John had been deposed . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took out a Bible from the rack in front of him , not to read , just to hold , like an amulet . He too , in his own small way , had taken steps away from being a boy and toward being a man , although there was no ceremony to commemorate it . He was n't even sure it was an event worth celebrating . <p> The idea of a Bar Mitzvah had never been discussed between Alex and his mother , and he had never given it any thought until the beginning of the eighth grade school year , when the invitations began to arrive . He remembered the first one , which he and his mother had puzzled over with the unabashed awe of primitives who have found a functioning match book . It was a large square envelope , cream colored and made of a paper stock less flexible than certain kinds of wood . The type on the enclosed invitation was thick enough to read by touch . There were copious amounts of gauzy tissue paper in there as well , and other envelopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to far off dates . The slightly askance stamp was the only evidence that a human being had anything to do with this assemblage of objects . <p> " What I do n't understand , " said Alex at the time , " Is that I do n't think Richard Edleman even likes me . Why is he inviting me to his Bar Mitzvah ? " <p> " Maybe he does like you , " his mother , ever the optimist , had replied . <p> " No , that 's not an issue , okay ? That 's not possible . Maybe he just invited the whole grade . " He was making a joke . <p> But Richard Edleman had in fact invited the whole grade . Six weeks after the invitation arrived Alex had been stuffed into a jacket and tie and sent off to attend a service in which Edleman , a nervous boy who , at the age of thirteen , had a body that suggested that not one single pubic hair had yet sprouted on it , stood robed in strange garments and read Hebrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the Synagogue along with the rest of his class . The boys sat in one section and the girls in another . Afterward there was a bus that took everyone down to the World Trade center . The invitation had said : " Reception at Windows on the World . " <p> Windows on the World was a restaurant on the top floor of one of the World Trade Center towers . Therefore , it had a view . Everyone was very excited about the view , and for the first ten minutes the whole class flocked to the windows and pressed their faces against it , peering out at New Jersey or the Atlantic Ocean , depending on which way they were facing . Windows on the World was a distinguished restaurant which served very good food at exorbitant prices , and the presence of fifty screaming kids would have depressed and angered many of the lunch patrons , had they been there . But no one was there , because , for a fee equal to about two years ' school tuition for their son , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those whose face was pressed eagerly to the glass one hundred and one stories above the ground . But in a short while he unstuck his nose and began walking around the tables , looking at the name tags that were written out in neat script and sat on every plate . He lingered among the tables , feeling intimidated by the array of silverware and the fancy lettering on the name cards . He had sat through that lunch with a stiff posture , spoke hardly at all , and made a point of keeping his elbows off the table . For some reason he was under the impression that his mother was going to be judged by his behavior here , and he wanted to make a good showing . <p> His classmates did not feel the same compulsion . Specifically , the gang of boys who more or less ran the grade , and to whom Alex had tangentially attached himself , discovered that Mr. Edward Edleman , who was presiding over this celebration of his son 's Bar Mitzvah with evident pride , smoked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole eighth grade class , Edward Edleman had invited the entire executive staff of the electronics firm of which he was vicepresident , and was busy greeting them and making jokes and spotting small intrigues of conversation and affiliation that were bubbling around the room . So he was very surprised when a rumor welled up among the younger generation that the stuff in his pipe was not tobacco , but marijuana . No one actually believed he was smoking pot , but Edward Edleman was , on some deep and partially buried level , a nice man , and furthermore he was genuinely moved by his son 's Bar Mitzvah , and proud of the event he was putting on , and all these genuine human emotions made him vulnerable . Alex 's classmates had a desire to attack the vulnerability that was as natural and innate as their ability to detect its presence . <p> And so from the depths of the party came the chant , " Eddie is stoned ! Eddie is stoned ! " And soon kids were running around laughing hysterically and screaming " Crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expression became strained . One of his colleagues sidled up to him and said , " What 's up , Crazy Eddie ? " Mr. Edleman had the nauseating premonition that it was a name that would stick around the office for years . The sight of a gang of thirteen year olds running around calling him Eddie was not part of the fantasy he had long nurtured for how this day would unfold . He put his pipe away . He stopped milling around the party and hung back in a corner , looking a bit tired and aggrieved . Eventually he was discarded as the favored object of scorn because the troublesome group of boys were distracted by a more interesting target . They began harassing a group of girls . One girl in particular seemed to be the object of their scorn and desire . From across the room he could see that she looked genuinely frightened by the group of boys that encircled her . An hour earlier Mr. Edleman would have intervened , but he had been mauled into submission and simply turned his gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious business . <p> What Crazy Edward Edleman had looked away from was a heated discussion between a group of girls and a group of boys . Al Neuman , who did double duty as class clown and class pervert , had tried to grab Marcy Goldblum 's breast . Marcy-who was still two years away from the nose job she already fantasized about , who was popular , and who did n't have much breast to grab-knocked his hands away with an aristocratic slap . A conversation , or rather an inarticulate screaming match , followed , in which the girls more or less tried to explain that the boys could n't just grab them , they had to at least try to talk to them . After a minute of this Al , who was crashing from the initial sugar rush of euphoria he experienced whenever he touched a girl , walked over to Tania Vincent and grabbed her breast . <p> Tania had wavy golden hair , pale skin , and a pretty nose . Her claim to fame in the eighth grade was that she had breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys in the grade to interact with her in a civilized manner . <p> Now , everyone watched Al 's knotty little fingers sink into Tania 's right breast . She screamed . The girls shrieked and the boys let out a yell as though someone had just hit a home run , and in one short instant the essential architecture of Bar Mitzvah socializing for the remainder of the year had been established . It was a peculiar form of flirtation that mixed elements of tag and rape . There was a weird element of status involved as well , since only the more popular boys did the grabbing , and only the more popular girls had to run around with their hands over their breasts . <p> In the midst of all the screaming Alex looked across the room and was amazed to see Mr. Edleman off in the distance , watching the proceedings , but standing immobile . He had been beaten into submission by the eighth grade . Years later Alex would still think about the Bar Mitzvahs of that year and wonder that such behavior was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that adults were full of their own fears and anxieties , and were as mortal and prone to error as any eighth grader , if not more so . <p> Edleman 's Bar Mitzvah was just the start . A few months later Alex was a veteran of Windows on the World , which seemed to be the destination of choice for Bar Mitzvah parties , although there were other opulent destinations as well . He had seen adults get drunk , and had stolen half finished drinks off the adult tables to drink himself . He had watched classmates anxiously sing Hebrew words , be praised by rabbis , and later receive envelope after envelope from friends and relatives , each containing a check of biblical proportions . <p> He had been barraged by clowns and magicians and enthusiastic disc jockeys who played " Ring my Bell " and " Push Push in the Bush " when they wanted to get people dancing , and who then played the soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever once they were . He possessed , along with a closet full of stupid door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping around spastically on the dance floor in a rare moment of inhibition , while simultaneously puzzling over the lyric : " You ca n't hope / To Understand / The New York Times effect on man . " <p> Phil Singer 's Bar Mitzvah promised to be different from the others , and at first glance it was-it was even fancier . There were banquette tables set up throughout the Plaza ballroom . Bouquets of flowers sat on each table , above which hung clusters of white helium balloons . There was a buffet . Already Alex could sense a weird panic in the eyes of his friends . There had been such a buildup to this Bar Mitzvah that something more than a veal cutlet was going to have to happen . A big brass band played quietly , though ominously , as though they were just limbering up , and would start to seriously swing once people had a chance to digest . <p> The boys wore their suits and exalted in the discovery that the bartenders scattered around the Plaza ballroom were willing to serve them drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meanwhile , continued to refine their adult-like behavior . They wore dresses and elegant suits , they had their hair done , they wore makeup and jewelry . <p> At the Plaza Alex was seated at the same table as Tania . She looked assured and womanly as she engaged in conversation with Marcy Goldblum . <p> " And then she got up to go to bathroom and missed the back seat scene , " Tania was saying now , " and when I told her about it later she was so pissed . " <p> " That was the most intense scene of the movie , " replied Marcy . <p> " What back seat scene ? " said John Goldman , who was sitting next to Alex . " Why is it that I never understand what the hell anyone is talking about ? " <p> " They 're talking about a dirty scene in a movie , " said Alex . <p> " We 're talking about Saturday Night Fever , " said Marcy from across the table , in a loud aggressive voice that seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own . <p> Tania did n't even look over . She just tossed her hair a little . She nodded knowingly as she spoke and elegantly brought her fork to her mouth . She was quite womanly , Alex thought . She was wearing a pretty dress with a lace frill around the collar and sleeves and a provocative pink ribbon tied between her breasts , as though it were a shoe lace . Alex stared intently at her hands as she used her silverware , and occasionally he stared at the space between her breasts , covered but not entirely obscured by the ribbon . He imagined Ugly George 's hand reaching out and tugging at it gently , until it came apart . <p> " I did n't see Saturday Night Fever , " said John . " My mother would n't let me . " <p> Alex stared at him incredulously , torn between hating him passionately for being a geek , and admiring him for having the gall to say the truth , which , as it happened , was the same truth that applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were it not for the fact that the Jaws Part II experience still lurked , with accompanying soundtrack , in the back of his mind . He had been forbidden to see Jaws Part II but had snuck in on his own one afternoon a few days before leaving for sailing camp . He returned from sailing camp with awards in riflery , archery , and tennis , but the only water that had touched his skin either came out of a shower or was heavily chlorinated , and every time someone touched his leg in the pool he became hysterical . <p> Something about the way Tania moved , the way she talked , the way she brought her fork to her mouth , made her seem much too good for the bacterial fungus that composed eighth grade society . Alex was intent on interacting with her in a civilized manner , but could not seem to manage it . She liked art , and spent time after school in the art studio painting , and once Alex had seen her all by herself after school , walking with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . This was the perfect opportunity for him to express his admiration for her , to show he was interested in art , and generally to distance himself from the baboon like behavior of his classmates . Practically hyperventilating with effort , he had made himself call out to her as she walked by . " Let me see it ! " he said . <p> He was referring to the canvas , but Tania hurried past without looking up . He stood there amazed at this misunderstanding , but unable to correct it . <p> Now he tried to glance at her surreptitiously , but his glances kept devolving into stares , which would be broken only when her eyes raked briefly across his face and he immediately looked down . Unwilling and also unable to muster the grabby aggressive prerogative of his classmates , his only strategy involved being so passive and pathetic and conspicuously inept that she would be forced to take pity on him , approach him , talk to him , get to know him really well , and then , on her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became vague and possessed of the illogic of dreams-she would take off her shirt , and let him see , just because she felt like it . He understood that this was an unrealistic scenario , but was at a loss for anything to replace it . <p> Eventually the party became wild and dispersed . The grown ups got drunk and danced . The kids got drunk and danced . The usual ritual of boys grabbing girls was played out . The swing band was replaced by a disc jockey . Phil Singer made out very publicly with Audrey Stevens and then they both disappeared , and a joke made the rounds that they had rented a room . Then Audrey reappeared and said Phil had passed out on one of the couches outside . <p> Gradually all the kids came out to view the body . He lay there looking very peaceful , with envelopes bulging out of all his pockets . The only thing askance were his feet , which were not really in a comfortable position , but turned in toward each other . <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singer when she saw her son . She stroked his face and put a pillow under his head and then went and got a shoe box and put all the envelopes in it . An older lady came out and looked down at Phil and then at the assembled youth who were standing around . <p> " Who did this ! " She demanded of the crowd , as though someone had forced Phil to get drunk , or had perhaps hit him over the head and robbed him . " Who did this to Phily ? " She was , Alex surmised from the " Phily , " the grandmother . He wanted very much to explain to this woman that no one had done anything to Phil Singer , quite the contrary , this was yet another small bit of philanthropy that Phil had doled out to the rest of the class in a moment of generosity-he wanted to explain that her grandson was a great guy because he had single handedly changed the definition of cool in the eighth gradehe had written the word TULL on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front rank of popular bands in the grade , and had then , once this happened , crossed it out . This in a class where the most popular boys had previously been neat fastidious creeps like Arnold Gerstein who did n't even want his down jacket to get wet . Phil did bong hits before the morning bus and once brought a bottle of vodka into school , which he shared with a large group of boys during lunch , leading to Allen Fluss 's infamous vomit in geometry episode . Phil was a rebel who understood that things were fucked up and was willing to do something about it . If what he was willing to do was pass out on his Bar Mitzvah , then so be it . All this raced through Alex 's mind , which the woman seemed to read like a ticker tape , for she turned toward and him and said , with a quivering accusatory finger raised in his direction , " You ! What have you done to Phily ! " <p> " Me ? " said Alex , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ringleader ! " <p> This was perhaps the least accurate description of himself that Alex had ever heard . He could n't face this hysterical woman , and he suddenly could n't face the mirth of the Bar Mitzvah party . He saw that a number of people were drifting off into an adjoining room and he followed them . <p> He walked into the cream and candy colored sitting area , which was adjacent to the ladies ' room . Couches and easy chairs and throw pillows were placed elegantly here and there , and the beige carpet gave the strange piece of theater unfolding before his eyes a hushed , unreal quality . <p> Al Neuman and Jack Gold were struggling with Tania Vincent , who was strangely quiet while she tried to get them off . After occupying the huge cathedral of the ballroom for so long this small pretty enclosed space seemed illicit and private . The room was filling up with kids , as though some accident had just occurred , and they were gathering around to rubberneck . Except the accident was in progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stop it ! " She kept saying that over and over again . What was so strange was that rather than a hit and run attack , which was the normal mode of operation , Al Neuman and Jack Gold were struggling with Tania as though she were a running back in football that they were trying to tackle . Then there was a ripping sound . Jack Gold had managed to get his hand into that space where the pink ribbon was , and had torn the dress , and just then Arnold Gerstein came running over and grabbed both of Tania 's arms and held them behind her back , and for one split second Tania 's dress was pulled all the way down to her waist and her breasts fell forward , completely exposed , jiggling and awkward . Every person in the room screamed . The girls screamed in horror and the boys screamed as though they were at a sporting event and the home team just scored . Alex started laughing with hysterical glee at what he had just seen , and within his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone was yelling , and he just stood there watching it unfold , amazed at the momentum of events . Tania was crying now , her hands cupping her breasts , while several pairs of hands tried to pry them off or squeeze the parts that were not covered . Her friends came to the rescue , and there were shrieks and screams . Ellen Levine was pounding Jack Gold in the face , and Tania broke away and ran for the ladies ' room . <p> Every boy in the room followed in hot pursuit . There was no context to their actions , just wild giddiness , the chase , the yelling , the brief glimpse of what had been imagined for so long . Alex ran with them , swept up in the momentum of what was happening . <p> Tania pushed through the door to the ladies ' room and it had hardly closed before eight more boys were clamoring to get through the same door . The light was different in here . The cream colored hues of the sitting room had given way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one of the stalls , slammed the door shut , and locked it . The boys leapt onto its sides like braying animals , their hands reaching down into the stall toward Tania , who shrank back in tears . Alex was among the first to leap onto that flimsy metal partition . He looked down at Tania . <p> The first thing he saw were her braces . An enormous amount of metal was affixed to her teeth . You did n't usually see it , because Tania did n't have the kind of mouth that showed her teeth , but now her mouth was configured in the figure eight of sobs , and they gleamed in the light . She clutched her torn dress to herself . She was crying now , real sobs of fear and despair and sadness . Finally all that womanliness was gone under the bright fluorescent lights , and Alex could see the thin blue veins on her chest and neck and face ; her whole body seemed pale and bluish in that light , and her tears streaked mascara and her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the first time , part of his group , part of his class , and his world . <p> Then the feeling abated , and he hung there , feet dangling , eyes bulging from the strain of the thin metal wall pressing into his stomach , looking at down at Tania . He wanted very much to say something . He wanted to apologize . But this was not a good time for apologies . His pride at finally having done something vied with his shame at what he had done . Eventually he got down with all the other boys , and was herded into the group that the Plaza Hotel Security staff , who had burst onto the scene in their uniforms , walkie talkies cackling , identified as the criminal element . The criminal element stood there unworried . <p> " What are you going to do ? " Gerstein said . " You 're just security guards . We pay you guys . " They were kept in the room just long enough for the truth of this statement to dissipate a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seemed amazingly composed . She walked out without saying a word , her chin held high , while all her friends walked with her , calling the boys assholes over their shoulders . <p> Eventually the group dispersed , but not before Phil Singer 's grandmother appeared on the scene and again became hysterical at the sight of Alex . " It 's him ! " She cried . Alex was amazed to note that he felt flattered by this . <p> Soon afterward the party began to disperse . Alex walked through the Plaza 's glittering lobby , his knees loose and bouncy with nervous energy , the plush springy carpet making him feel as though he might float up toward the ceiling . None of the grown-ups in the lobby knew of the events that had just transpired in the ladies ' room , yet they seemed as though they could fathom them , understand their context , grasp the dreamlike quality of their sequence . <p> The same could not be said for the world beyond the Plaza 's heavy front door . He pushed through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was dusk , and cloudy , and the city looked a bit blue and feverish , as though it were n't getting enough oxygen . He had moved through the ballroom , and that small , warmly lit sitting room , and the bright fluorescent bathroom , like a superball racing in the air for longer than seemed natural . But now gravity reasserted itself , and time returned to its normal pace . <p> He walked up Central Park South to Sixth Avenue , shivering a little in the cold air and pulling his scarf tightly around his neck . He had cab fare but decided , as some kind of penance , to take the number 5 bus . He waited for the number 5 until the sky was black and his teeth were chattering , and then hailed a cab . <p> When he got into his apartment he felt its warmth envelop him as though a blanket had been thrown over his shoulders . He headed straight for his room . <p> " Did you have a nice time ? " his mother called after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more a yelp than a comment . He stepped into his room , and pulled the door shut . <p>
