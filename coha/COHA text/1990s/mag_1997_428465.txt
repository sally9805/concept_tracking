Section : Sports Top 40 Out-of-sight basketball deals pushed up pay by 24% for the Forbes Super 40 athletes . Average annual take : $17 million <p> ELEVEN MEMBERS of this year 's Super 40 are basketball players , the most from one sport since we started tracking athletes ' incomes in 1990 . Last year three hoopsters  --  Shaquille O'Neal , Alonzo Mourning and Juwan Howard  --  each signed deals worth more than $100 million  --  the first nine-figure contracts in sports history . <p> That in large part explains why the take of the Forbes Super 40 surged 24% last year , from $556 million to $687 million . Average per athlete : $17 million . Our 40th-ranked athlete , Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre , took in $9.2 million . <p> Michael Jordan continued piling it up . This season 's salary is $33 million , which will count more in 1998 . It helps bring his total take since 1990 to over $300 million in salary and endorsement money . <p> Boxer Mike Tyson is a distant second at $182 million . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearly half of last year 's Super 40 were off the list this year . Dropping off were football players Troy Aikman , Emmitt Smith , Steve Young , Neil O'Donnell , John Elway and Dan Marino . Three basketball players fell off , including Patrick Ewing ( who will be back ) and Clyde Drexler ( who wo n't ) . Boxer Riddick Bowe retired , as did hockey star Mario Lemieux . <p> Newcomers include five basketball players  --  Mourning , Howard , Gary Payton , Horace Grant and Reggie Miller . The top newcomer is a bit of a surprise , Joe Sacik of hockey 's Colorado Avalanche , who banked a $15 million signing bonus . <p> All figures are FORBES estimates for the 1997 calendar year . The Salary/Winnings figure includes salary , prize money and signing and incentive bonuses . The Endorsements figure includes traditional endorsement income , licensing royalties , exhibition and appearance fees and money from celebrity-related activities such as autograph signings and speeches . <p> Some of these folks are even richer than we show : Our numbers do n't even include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Top this if you can : Jordan 's new $33 million contract for this season broke the record for the biggest single-season salary in sports . Add $47 million in off-court earnings , and he 's the highest-paid athlete ever . Revenues from his Space Jam movie roll in , as do royalties from his wildly successful Bijan cologne . But wait until next year : His new line of Jordan athletic shoes and apparel for Nike hit the stores in November . TABLE <p> The $33 million purse he pulled in for the infamous Bite of the Century rematch with Mike Tyson undoubtedly eased the pain of losing part of his right ear . The win also allowed him to start a lucrative quest to reunify the heavyweight rifle , which he kicked off last month by taking Michael Moorer in an 8th-round TKO . Next up : A bout with Lennox Lewis is expected this spring . TABLE <p> With five fights this year  --  including eight-figure paychecks against Pernell Whitaker in April and Hector Camacho in September  --  boxing 's Golden Boy put together the most lucrative year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for even more big-money bouts next year , including a possible rematch with Whitaker or a match with much-feared welterweight champ Felix Trinidad . TABLE <p> Schumacher saw his third Formula One title slip through his fingers when he crashed during the last race of the season . But the circuit 's most popular driver just signed a new deal with Omega watches to add to his endorsement portfolio , led by Nike and Dekra , a German pollution control company . His largest chunk of off-course change is from the Schumacher Collection , a catalog of more than 50 products , including toy cars , pit jackets and perfumes . TABLE <p> He 's made a staggering $142 million since his release from prison in 1995 . But his ear-biting attack on Holyfield in June cost him $3 million , the largest fine in sports history , and put his whole career in jeopardy . The Nevada State Athletic Commission will decide whether or not to lift Tyson 's ban from the ring at a hearing next summer . The former champ has said he expects the commission to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First man ever to earn $2 million oil the PGA Tour , the first-year pro and Masters champ is already the second-best-paid endorser in sports . To his blue-chip deals with Nike and Titleist he 's added American Express , Rolex and Japanese coffeemaker Asahi . Look for a seven-figure annual deal with CBS Sportsline this month . Is he worth it ? Nike thinks so : Sales of its golf line have more than doubled since he signed on . Nike will bring out a new Woods apparel line next spring , and a Nike-licensed video golf game . TABLE <p> Steel flopped at the box office , so for the first time since 1994 , Shaq 's take does n't include a salary from a new flick . No matter : Endorsement deals with Reebok and PepsiCo power an impressive off-court portfolio . His record label , Twism ( The World Is Mine ) , just formed a joint venture with A &M; Records to produce his fourth rap album . His Twism urban clothing line will generate about $5 million in sales this year . A new endorsement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletic apparel will complement his high-end deal with Reebok . TABLE <p> Huge amounts of money are flowing into stock car racing , and Earnhardt is still Nascar 's most venerated driver , despite a 58-race winless streak . " The Intimidator " still rakes in millions for his cut of the T shirts and caps sold with his likeness and his No. 3 Goodwrench Chevrolet race car on them . His endorsement portfolio includes Anheuser-Busch , Cadbury Schweppes ( Dr Pepper , 7UP ) , Coca-Cola , Burger King and Wrangler Jeans . TABLE <p> The New York Rangers shocked the hockey world when they tried to poach Sacik away from the 1996 Stanley Cup champs with a 3-year , $21 million contract plus a $15 million signing bonus , the largest in NHL history . The financially strapped Avalanche responded by matching the offer , keeping their captain in Denver . Like most hockey players , not much endorsement work . TABLE <p> After single-handedly making Fila a player in the lucrative basketball footwear business , Hill has seen sales of his signature line of sneakers fall off for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. endorser with a new seven-year , $80 million contract , making him the second-highest-paid sneaker-pitcher in sports , behind only Michael Jordan . Other national deals include Sprite , McDonald 's , Kellogg , Wilson and GMC Trucks . TABLE <p> Big endorsement deals with Maxfli , Boeing , Chevy , Bell Helicopter and Cobra helped the Great White Shark move up on the list this year . The Greg Norman Collection , an apparel line with his Shark logo made by Reebok , did $100 million in sales this year . Norman 's cut : about $3.5 million . Next : restaurants . Greg Norman Down Under Grills will open in Myrtle Beach , S.C . and Orlando , Fla. next year ; Norman gets a fee for each one built . TABLE <p> Bouncing back from prostate cancer surgery last winter , hard-charging Arnie was back on the course after only eight - weeks . Biggest recent deal is with Federated Department Stores ( Bloomingdale 's , Macy 's ) to produce the Arnold Palmer Collection line of high-end casual attire . Long-term endorsement programs continue with Cadillac , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before teammate Shaquille O'Neal left Orlando to play for the Lakers , Grant agreed to stay with the Magic . His loyalty was rewarded with a five-year , $50 million deal that pushes him onto our list for the first time . Nike pays him to wear its shoes and Liberty Optical shells out for him to wear its goggles on the court . TABLE <p> Two bouts this year at just over $5 million a pop for the brawling baby boomer , including a 12-round split decision over the respectable Louis Savarese in Atlantic City in April . His most impressive score , however , may be his George Foreman Lean Mean Grilling Machine , sold through infomercials and shopping networks . Foreman took in close to $2 million from the cooker that reduces fat in hamburgers . Next : George Foreman Meat Loaf . Then George wants to make hash out of the heavyweight champ . " He really wants Holyfield , " says his attorney , Henry Holmes . TABLE <p> Another year as the best tennis player in the world . His on-court winnings augmented considerably by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cup in Munich in September . Nike ( shoes and apparel ) and Wilson ( racket ) continue to be his biggest endorsement deals . Also pitches Movado watches , MBNA credit cards , business jets , videogames . TABLE <p> A wrist injury kept Agassi off the court for most of the year , so his prize money and ranking on our list suffered accordingly . But he 's still the most popular player in the game and a great collector of endorsement money . Huge deal with Nike continues , as do long-term pacts with racketmaker Head , Canon and Pepsi . With fellow Forbes 40ers Woods , Gretzky and Griffey , he 's a stakeholder in the Official All Star Cafe . TABLE <p> Breaking Lou Gehrig 's consecutive game streak two years ago moved Ripken from the realm of sports hero to national celebrity . Baseball iron man 's endorsement income has improved accordingly . New deals with AlliedSignal ( Fram oil filters ) and Nabisco helped boost his numbers . But a quarter of his off-field money comes from sales of Ripken memorabilia : lithographs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay is n't based on the number of days he shows up at work . Because of injuries , Robinson played only six games last season . A chronic back problem forced him to miss the start of the season . When that healed , he promptly fractured his left foot . Resulting surgery forced him to miss the rest of the year . AT &T; and Doritos endorsements , new pact with Nabisco to pitch Oreos goes with long-term Nike deal . TABLE <p> Griffey 's new contract ( including $1.5 million of his signing bonus ) kicked in this year , and Junior did n't disappoint . His 56 home runs were the most by an American Leaguer since Roger Maris broke Babe Ruth 's storied single-season mark in 1961 . Strong endorsement lineup led by Nike , which pays him more than twice what any other baseball player gets ; in return , Griffey devotes much of the off-season to Nike promotion . Sizable deals with Upper Deck , Nintendo and Pizza Hut continue . TABLE <p> Mourning 's seven-year , $105 million contract last year was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow Forbes All-Stars Shaquille O'Neal and Juwan Howard and , more recently , future listers Shawn Kemp and Kevin Garnett . Strong deal with Nike fuels his endorsement portfolio , which also includes Coca-Cola and McDonald 's . TABLE <p> Best year yet on the court , spending almost all of it as the number two player in the world . That status helped push up Chang 's appearance fees and endorsement income , especially in tennis-crazy Asia , where the Chinese-American is arguably the continent 's most popular athlete . New deals with Eveready and Nissan augment a strong list of endorsements , led by Prince and a big Reebok deal that was made even more lucrative this year . TABLE <p> Never heard of this guy , who calls himself Prince Naseem ? You will soon . Wildly popular in his native U.K. and in the Middle East ( his parents emigrated from Yemen ) , the featherweight just inked a multifight deal with Time Warner 's HBO division , and his first fight outside the British Isles is scheduled for this month at Madison Square Garden against New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract with Adidas , to add to deals with Audi , McDonald 's and Sony PlayStation . TABLE <p> Although it proved lucrative in the end , the free-agent market was tough on Howard last year . The forward decided to flee the nation 's capital , signing a $101 million contract with the Miami Heat in July 1996 . But as the ink was drying , the NBA ruled the contract invalid , arguing the Heat had violated the league 's convoluted salary cap rules . So Howard returned to the Wizards ( originally gullets ) , who forked over even more money to keep their man in town . Endorsement deals include Nike , Coke and McDonald 's . TABLE <p> After taking the Sonics to the NBA finals in 1996 and being named the NBA 's top defensive player , Payton was rewarded with a seven-year , $88 million contract . The deal included a big signing bonus , but his annual salary alone was more than enough to put him on our list this year . In addition , Nike inked the point guard to an endorsement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Air Glove . He also pitches for AirTouch Cellular and Upper Deck . TABLE <p> Maddux just might be the greatest pitcher of all time ; he certainly is the highest paid . His new five-year , $57.5 million contract extension does n't begin until next season , but a $3 million signing bonus pushes him on our list this year . Like most baseball players , Maddux does limited endorsement work . The money he does make off-field , mostly from autographs and sales of Maddux paraphernalia , all goes to charity . TABLE <p> The unassuming center from Nigeria took his turn on last year 's NBA money machine when he signed a reported five-year contract extension worth $65 million . The deal should keep him in Houston for the rest of his career . His quiet demeanor has slowly earned him a decent list of endorsements , including Spalding ; plus the NBA pays him to be the league 's " international ambassador . " TABLE <p> Rodman 's bad-boy act may be wearing thin . His second book , Walk on the Wild Side , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I Wan na Be . His new shoe with Converse was slow to take off . He was dropped by Carl 's Jr . after making comments that offended Mormons . His salary was cut by more than $1 million last year because of fines and suspensions . But he still finds ways to bring in cash . For example , a made-for-TV movie based on his autobiography netted him $500,000 and will appear on ABC next year . TABLE <p> Gretzky lost close friend and teammate Mark Messier when Messier jumped to the Vancouver Canucks , but the Great One decided to stay put , inking a two-year contract extension with the Rangers just before the season started , Off the ice , it was Gretzky who jumped ship , leaving Easton , his longtime equipment endorsee , so he could join with partners in buying venerable Hespeler Hockey , the same stickmaker he used as a child in Ontario . TABLE <p> His powerful bat and access to the Los Angeles media market make the slugging catcher a good deal of money . But his biggest asset may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hero in his native Japan . Piazza 's association with Nomo has helped him break into the lucrative Japanese endorsement market , where he has pocketed big deals from Tokyo-based Komatsu ( construction equipment ) and underwear maker Gunze . TABLE <p> Yet another basketball star who makes our list by cashing in big during last year 's NBA free-agent bonanza . Miller was rumored to be headed for New York to play for the Knicks but instead re-upped with the Pacers . Big deal with Nike heads endorsements . Also a burgeoning broadcast career : Did color commentary for Lifetime Television 's broadcasts of WNBA games . TABLE <p> When Belle signed his five-year , $55 million deal with Chicago last year , it was the largest contract in baseball history . But the honor was short-lived : Atlanta Braves pitcher Greg Maddux has since surpassed him . Do n't feel sorry for him . A clause in his contract requires the Sox to adjust his salary every year to ensure that he 's one of the three highest-paid players in the game . Alas , being baseball 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals . TABLE <p> With movie-star looks and a beauty-queen wife , this California native ( raised in Indiana ) could well become stock car racing 's first national superstar . Already featured in a nationwide ad for Pepsi with fellow Forbes All-Star Shaquille O'Neal . Burst on the scene two years ago , when he became the youngest man ever to win the Winston Cup Series , which he did again this year . Makes the most of his offtrack money through licensing ; has a handful of endorsement deals , including Pepsi , Ray-Ban sunglasses and Edy's-Dryer 's Ice Cream . TABLE <p> Sanders became the highest-paid nonquarterback in the NFL when , after a brief holdout , he signed a five-year deal with the Lions with a $12.8 million signing bonus ( $7 million of which he got this year ; the rest is deferred until 1998 ) . Big endorsement deals with Nike , DirecTv and Cadillac . The former Oklahoma State standout has n't forgotten his roots : Used some of his bonus money to buy a controlling stake in a Tulsa bank . TABLE <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a provision in the NHL 's new collective bargaining agreement that allows young players a limited form of free agency . The new rule has put wealthier clubs in a position to lure young talent away from smaller-market teams with huge signing bonuses . In Gratton 's case , a five-year , $16 . S million offer along with a $9 million bonus was enough for the Flyers to snatch the forward away from the Tampa Bay Lightning . TABLE <p> The British heavyweight returns to the Super 40 for the first time since 1994 after a very strange year . First , he recaptured the WBC belt in February , when opponent Oliver McCall refused to defend himself and broke down crying in the fifth round . Then a July bout was stopped after his opponent was disqualified for excessive holding . But his pummeling of talented but troubled Pole Andrew Golota in October  --  the bout lasted 95 seconds-has restored Lewis ' credibility and will likely gain him a lucrative payday against Holyfield next spring . TABLE <p> When Moorer lost his heavyweight title ( and his respectability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brooding southpaw off for good . But last year Moorer regained the belt against German Axel Schultz , earning him a big payday against Holyfield . Even though he lost the bout , the purse plus a fight in February were enough to boost him onto our list for the first time in three years . TABLE <p> Sammy who ? The hapless Cubs stunned baseball when they inked the unsung Dominican to a four-year , $42.5 million contract extension . Although the deal does n't start until 1998 , a $4 million signing bonus edges him onto our list this year . Not that it helped any : Chicago ended up in last place yet again and Sosa hit a lowly.251 . Endorsements limited to smallish equipment deals with Nike and Rawlings . TABLE <p> For the first five years that FORBES tracked athlete income , the Golden Bear was a staple in the top ten . Then last year Nicklaus took a big chunk of his businesses  --  including his 30-year master licensing arrangement  --  public through Golden Bear Golf Inc . Since the Super 40 does n't count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he wo n't go hungry : A new deal with Citibank boosts his endorsement income , and his 54% stake in Golden Bear is worth about $38 million . TABLE <p> The Big Hurt signed a contract extension at the end of the year , but it brings in no new cash for 1997 . Endorsements led by Reebok , which pays the giant first baseman more than any other baseball player in its stable . Also strong deals with Donruss ( baseball cards ) and Acclaim ( videogame : All-Star Baseball ' 97 Featuring Frank Thomas ) . He and Albert Belle are the first baseball teammates to make our list since the Mots ' Dwight Gooden and Bobby Bonilla in 1993 . TABLE <p> The year started with a victory in Super Bowl XXXI , and things only got better from there . Both Nike and the Packers gave Favre new contracts ; Green Bay 's pact included a $12 million signing bonus ( $4 million of which came in 1997 ) , and Nike will shell out about $1 million per year over the next five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sprint , among others . CONTRACT QUIRKS Mark McGwire/St . Louis Cardinals <p> McGwire gets $1 for every fan the Cardinals draw over 2.8 million . Alas , last year the club sold only 2.7 million tickets . Gary Payton/Seattle SuperSonics <p> Payton has unlimited use of a luxury suite at Key Arena , Sonics ' home court in downtown Seattle . Brett Favre/Green Bay Packers <p> Last year Favre spent a month and a half in a rehab center for painkiller addiction . If he relapses , he 'll reportedly forfeit a big chunk of his salary . Albert Belle/Chicago White Sox <p> If Belle is not one of the sport 's three highest-paid players , based on average salary , the Sox must give him a raise or allow him to become a free agent . AUTHOR ! AUTHOR ! TABLE <p> Unlike the champ , it 's ponderous and trite . Best revelation : Holyfield 's childhood nickname was " Chubby . " TABLE <p> No ghostwriter  --  and it shows . Great baby pictures make up for lack of literary merit . TABLE <p> Nice pictures but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much the same . " TABLE <p> A grand life and a good read .
