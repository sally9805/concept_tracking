<p> HOW do you write something about a painter whose magic is to be found in the way he makes paint celebrate the shining surfaces , the multiple reflections , of a silver teapot ? Or the sweeping silhouette of a low , rounded hillside against an evening sky , with below it the rich green , stretching out smoothly , of a commonplace meadow ? <p> Here is an art of something-out-of-nothing , an artist who finds his vision , his significant image , in the mere skin of the world , in the surface appearances of everyday objects , of the unexceptional landscape . <p> English artist William Nicholson ( 1872-1949 ) , by all accounts , was not someone who liked art talk . He said extraordinarily little about his own work . He expected his paintings to " speak " for themselves in their own language - the language of painterly realism , of paint-erly idealism , of painterly sensuousness . He was as directly concerned with the purely visual as a musician is with sound . The clumsiness , slowness , and inadequacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark or a joke , must have seemed to him inappropriate to the act , or at any rate the effect , of painting . <p> The companion of his later years was novelist Marguerite Steen , certainly a woman of words . She wrote a book about him . And although she found little to quote , insights into Nicholson 's attitudes are there to be spotted . She points out , for example , that as a schoolboy , this Nottinghamshire-born painter was taken sketching by his art teacher among the impressive hills of the English Lake District . But , she adds , the " beauties " of the area " never took hold of him . It is a district overpictured201 ; as he says , ' the picture is there without painting it . ' " <p> So it is the painting that makes the picture . As a clue to Nicholson 's unpretentiousness , and of his conviction that the subject is not quite the main point of a painting , this remark is revealing . His preference was for the " unpromising subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , undramatic , even unpicturesque in themselves , but an ideal vehicle for a painter whose intent is to convey just the right light , just the true shadow . <p> What one remembers above all from a Nicholson painting is , in fact , his catching of light and shadow and their play on a surface - the slick shine of red patent leather ladies ' boots , the intense color of a shadow cast by some object or figure on a wall , the silver of moonlight on a still ocean , the bright highlights and transparency of a glass jug . He had a straight , uncomplex delight in luster and gleam and shine . He concentrated on that . <p> Portrait painting , particularly in the Edwardian period before the World War I , was Nicholson 's bread and butter : He was no Bohemian and chose a high standard of living . At that time he had a steady stream of notable sitters . Some art historians and critics , not entirely persuaded by his work , have damned him with faint praise , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living - his appearance of the flaneur - with the style of his painting . Frances Spalding , for instance , in her book " British Art Since 1900 , " calls him a " quintessential Edwardian " and uses phrases like " studied elegance " and " suggestions of ease and luxury . " <p> To a degree William Nicholson brought such dismissives upon himself . Those writing about him seem unable to resist mentioning his white duck trousers and spotted shirt . But to suggest that Nicholson 's approach to painting was somehow lightweight , because of his sartorial preferences , is silly . He was an extrovert ; he joked and chatted while painting portraits . His daughter , Liza , describes him as virtually licking his lips while he painted , relishing the luscious quality of turning subject into paint . She says , " he was a sensuous and not an intellectual painter . " There was an element of performance about his work . <p> His paintings look extraordinarily spontaneous . But Steen continually emphasizes the time he spent on them ; portraits took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of William 's work has ever come to him easily . The seeming lightsomeness - particularly noticeable in some of his later Still Life - covers an agony of effort201 . ' I have to learn it all first . ' When ' learnt , ' the final utterance is swift and sure - rather like a stammerer who , after long training , is at last delivered of a perfect sentence . " But Nicholson was not the kind of painter who wanted the world to see , in his work , any evidence of that " agony of effort . " <p> Looking at some of his earliest work , the work on which his considerable reputation was originally based , shows clearly that what was involved in this apparent ease of statement was not so much a pleasure in clever style , but a scrupulous determination to do without the unnecessary so that the painting is free to sing . This was a rebellion against Victorian painters who packed into their pictures as much miniscule detail as possible , smothering them with it . <p> Nicholson 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They made , under the assumed name of " J. &; W. Beggarstaff , " a number of highly original posters that have found an honored place in the history of the poster . <p> Bold and spare , these posters displayed an acute eye for the balancing of simplified shapes and essential outlines . Where detail or even a contour line could be left out , it was , letting the viewer 's certainty or guesswork supply what his eye did n't actually see : the line describing a leg or a shoulder . Forms were flattened as far as possible , becoming silhouettes either dark or light , and so the play of shapes across the surface became crucial . <p> Nicholson then went on to make some picture books - an " Alphabet , " for instance , and a collection of " London Types " - with " woodcuts " ( which were , technically speaking , wood engravings ) . They were colored , in a few special cases by hand in watercolor , but in the main by lithography . Like the earlier posters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large blacks in contrast to large whites , characterize these prints . Once again the extraneous is cut out . Economy was clearly equated with strength of image . <p> Although oil painting is an entirely different technique from wood engraving , Nicholson 's " fastidious economy " was not to be abandoned because of a change of medium . <p> When he told Steen that he had to " learn " something exhaustively before painting it , he presumably meant that he was studying how a particular subject could be most effectively translated onto canvas , into pigment , brushmark , and shapes disposed across the surface . The complex distractions and multiplicity of little details the eye perceives evidently needed selection and arrangement for them to work as a painting . <p> He continued his fascination for shadows - for the reductive character of a figure 's shadow cast on a wall , an object 's on a table . Steen was intrigued when she saw him start by painting a shadow of something in a picture before he painted the thing itself . He occasionally painted on glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object has to be painted first ; this doubtless challenged him . <p> One of William 's children , Ben Nicholson , who became an artist of international standing himself , summed it up laconically enough : " Behind his personality lay a very simple , direct painterly approach : he merely wanted to paint . " <p> Ben Nicholson also said that he himself owed a lot to his father , but his own work developed in ways that William Nicholson could hardly go along with . Cubism and abstraction were part of a revolutionary modernity and internationalism that Ben explored in his own way . Not William . He would sometimes even drop humorous comments at the expense of " the cubists . " <p> The elder Nicholson drew his inspiration as a young artist from Whistler and Manet - and through them from Velazquez . The Cubism that grew out of Cezanne 's quite different approach to the visible world was not for him . Perhaps it was a matter of choice rather than modernity , however . <p> His preference was for the surface , for painterliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures , and with drawing . They were intent on describing things from all sides . Nicholson was concerned with what the eye saw directly from the front - the skin and outward texture of the mushroom on the plate rather than its dissectible , three-dimensional , tactile form . <p> To place a William Nicholson still life next to a Picasso or Braque cubist still life would be instructive indeed about the differences between artists . But in his own unpretentious way , Nicholson was an experimenter . What he never did was simply repeat a practiced formula . His style may have been fluent , but it was n't some taken-for-granted trick of the hand . <p> William Nicholson 's lack of interest in what his son called " the universal contemporary spirit " has , however , rather too inevitably meant that his admirers feel the need to apologize for his modest Englishness and " regressive " attitudes . But his art has already quietly outlived its period , at least , and its " Englishness " can be challenged . Nicholson 's subject matter has no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other fine still-life painters - 17th-century Dutch or 19th-century French . His landscapes have been compared with Constable 's , but equally they show links with Monet and Corot . <p> It is probably time for a large-scale exhibition to reassess William Nicholson 's art . Much is still in private collections or buried in the storage vaults of institutions . Small shows occasionally take place in Britain . Catalogs have accompanied these shows . But after a long gap since Lillian Browse put together her Catalogue Raisonne ( 1956 ) , new books are starting to appear : two by Colin Campbell on " The Beggarstaff Posters " and Nicholson 's graphic work , and even more promisingly , research is under way under the auspices of " The William Nicholson Trust " to produce a book with a lot of good color reproductions . That is certainly needed .
