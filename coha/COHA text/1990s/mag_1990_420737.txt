Section : SPECIAL REPORT Crisis in the Gulf <p> Vietnam hangs in the collective subconscious like a bad dream , a psychic wound that leaves the patient forever neurotic . It hovers over politicians and policymakers , the past that will not die . For the baby boomers who saw their first body bag on the nightly news , for the onetime company commanders who now sit with stars on their shoulders in the corner offices of the E-Ring of the Pentagon , for the mothers whose sons are now but names on the Wall , the message echoes on and on : Never again . <p> So last week George Bush decided to answer the question that has shrouded his Persian Gulf policy since the first warships and planes headed off in harm 's way last August . " In our country , I know that there are fears of another Vietnam , " he told the nation last week . " Let me assure you , should military action be required , this will not be another Vietnam . This will not be a protracted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences between Then and Now : the " forces arrayed are different ; the opposition is different ; the resupply of Saddam 's military would be very different ; the countries united against him in the United Nations are different ; the topography of Kuwait is different , and the motivation of our all-volunteer force , " he concluded , in an oblique reference to the frightened draftees who were thrust into an unwinnable war in Vietnam , " is superb . " <p> The president 's message , say his top advisers , was aimed as much at Saddam Hussein as it was at the American public . The memory of Vietnam is global ; it remains the great American misadventure of the modern age . For the Iraqi strongman , the moral of Vietnam is that America lacks the will to fight , that once the body bags start coming home , the protesters will take to the streets and demand that the living come home with the dead . Saddam has memorized the lesson of Ho Chi Minh : that no matter how superior America 's force in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and minds of the American people behind it . <p> Bush , too , knows the lessons of Vietnam . He knows that Lyndon Johnson destroyed his presidency by failing to give peace a chance before it was too late . He knows that Johnson waited for four years  --  and thousands of American casualties  --  before openly trying to talk peace with the enemy . Johnson was already politically finished when he sent a delegation to Paris in May 1968 to negotiate with the North Vietnamese ; in the same speech he announced the peace talks , Johnson also announced that he would not seek another term as president . The president had no choice ; his party was in revolt along with the rest of the country . <p> Bush 's decision to send Secretary of State James Baker to Baghdad to meet with Saddam was taken as much to head off a congressional revolt and quell popular unrest as it was to seek a settlement to the crisis . All week long a parade of former soldiers and statesmen  --  all of them with vivid and often personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate Armed Services Committee . Sending Baker , said Sen .. ' Albert Gore of Tennessee , a Democratic member of Armed Services , was " politically brilliant . It bought Bush time . " Whether it wins peace is less certain . Baker 's mission is risky . He can not appear to be delivering an ultimatum . On the other hand , he can not seem to be inviting concessions . After all , this was the president who said that he would never negotiate with terrorists , and Saddam is a hostage-taker and terrorist on a far grander scale than the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . If Saddam senses that U.S. resolve is weakening , he may just decide to sit tight . America 's partners in the international coalition strangling Saddam may decide to ease their grip  --  and cut their own side deals . <p> Cold war : The announcement to send a special envoy came less than 24 hours after Bush had secured international backing to use force . By a 12-2 vote , with only Cuba and Yemen in dissent and China abstaining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of force if Saddam failed to quit Kuwait by Jan. 15 . It was a powerful demonstration of international resolve , one that would have been impossible during Vietnam , when the world was divided between East and West and the communist nations would automatically veto any move by the free world . Freed from the stasis of the cold war , Bush had achieved what the founders of the United Nations had only dreamed off true collective security against the forces of aggression . ' It did not go unnoticed on Capitol Hill that Bush seemed more intent on winning the support of foreign countries than his own duly elected lawmakers . " Presidents do not go to war , " grumbled Sen. John Glenn . " It is the nation that goes to war , and the people must understand and support the decision if we are to avoid the disasters of the past . " He did not need to identify which disaster he had in mind . Bush and his men were well aware of the growing restiveness in the American body politic . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote on a war-resolution of its own , but backed down , partly for fear the resolution would so divide Congress that the president would lack a clear mandate even if he won . <p> If Bush was wary of the power of Congress , so was Congress . The Constitution gives the legislative branch the power to declare war . But in modern times Congress has shirked that responsibility . Congress whined that Lyndon Johnson had weaseled his way to war with his flimsy Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964 . But when Congress wanted to stop the Vietnam War , the lawmakers needed only to pull the plug by refusing to authorize funds . The fact is that Congress wants to be consulted , that members of Congress ' want to make speeches and posture-but that they are all too willing to leave the responsibility for war on the shoulders of the president . <p> The strongest dissenting voices last week came from the foreign-policy and military . establishment that has grown up since Vietnam . Former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairmen Gen. David Jones and Adm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops to combat . This consensus was most clearly articulated by former secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger in 1984 . Weinberger set forth a half-dozen conditions that must be met before America goes to war : American interests must be vital , the American people must be fully in support and the war must be a last resort . Basically , it was a prescription for never going to war , since it is hard to imagine a war that would satisfy all the requirements . The Pentagon would support small wars that would be over in a few days at the cost of no more than a platoon  --  a Grenada or a Panama . But it never wanted to go through a protracted losing war like Vietnam , which the brass still believe was lost because their hands were tied . <p> No ' halfway effort ' : Bush made it very clear that he would not repeat Lyndon Johnson 's mistake of backing into war by increments . " I will never , ever agree to a halfway effort , " he told the nation last week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powell , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , made an all-out effort a condition of the Pentagon 's support when he agreed to support the intervention in the gulf last August . <p> In fact , a war against Iraq would not be Vietnam redux . The United States gradually ratcheted up its forces in Vietnam . First came the American " advisers , " then some air power , followed by Marines to protect an airfield , then ground troops for combat . But it took from 1961 , when the first advisers were deployed in significant numbers , until 1969 , to build up American forces to their peak of 540,000 . Bush , by contrast , will have some 400,000 American troops in the desert within five months of dispatching his first Marine . In Vietnam , American forces were restricted from going after certain targets ; for example , they were warned not to hit Soviet ships in Haiphong Harbor . They were told to stay out of Laos and Cambodia , thereby affording the North Vietnamese valuable sanctuaries . North Vietnam was constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow and Beijing . Saddam , once a well-supplied Soviet client , has been cut off by a global embargo . Ho Chi Minh was able to supply his forces along a well-camouflaged jungle trail that bore his name . Saddam 's supply lines will be across open desert , where Vietnam 1968 : American Marines evacuate the wounded at the battle of Hue American warplanes can not fail to see lumbering convoys . Americans were out-foxed by the Viet Cong 's guerrilla tactics . U.S. soldiers have always been better at wars of attrition  --  blunt force  --  than clever tactics . In Kuwait , the United States will be striking Iraqi soldiers in static defense positions . Sheer firepower will count for more than guile . <p> Still , there is the question of staying power . Iraq , after all , fought eight years against Iran without breaking . Iraqi forces may not be quick or mobile , but they are good at digging . Digging them out will be a hard , violent slog . Saddam is counting on his soldiers , inspired by Allah as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the softer Americans . America 's force in the field seems to be more willing than its Vietnam predecessor . The soldiers in the desert volunteered for service ; they were not drafted like many of their Vietnam counterparts . Too much can be made of the differences between then and now . More than half the men who died in Vietnam were in fact volunteers , not draftees . Furthermore , while American boys volunteered , many of them did not go into the service thinking they 'd actually have to fight . During the great cold-war standoff , a full-scale conventional war seemed highly unlikely to the average grunt . The small wars , like Panama , were fought by elite troops , Rangers and paratroopers , who wanted to see action . To create an all-volunteer army , the Pentagon had to offer good salaries and generous benefits . Soldiering became a job with security and good fringes , like travel and college loans . In many ways , the modern army is more domesticated than the Vietnam version . In 1971 , only 14 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Granted , there is a certain assumption of risk when the tool handed a worker is an M-16 . Still , if many of America 's soldiers are less than gung ho , they can not be blamed . And what was true in Vietnam is still true : the well-off and well educated will not be dy-Lug in foxholes . Minorities are even better represented than in Vietnam  --  while roughly 12 percent of the Vietnam forces were black , about 30 percent of active duty Army troops in the desert are African-American . <p> Eve of war : The generals who command these men seem confident of victory . But over-confidence is a generic disease among generals on the eve of war . This is particularly true of Air Force generals , who are forever predicting that air power can win the day , quick and clean . Strategic bombing had at best mixed results in World War II , and it was mostly a failure in Vietnam . The highly exposed Iraqi forces in Kuwait seem like a more promising target . The awful experience of war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go wrong : missed targets , death by " friendly fire , " equipment failure in the desert conditions harsh to high tech . <p> Even if the United States wins militarily , there is a nagging question that the administration has not yet satisfactorily answered . " What happens after you defeat Iraq ? " asks Edward Luttwak of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washingtom The United States may succeed only in replacing one aggressor with two : Iran and Syria . The whole region could be radicalized , endangering moderate regimes like those in Egypt and Jordan . " All you do by defeating Iraq is remove the immediate threat , " says Luttwak . " But you do nothing to remove the long-term threat of instability waiting in the wings . " That , in turn , could draw the United States into a deeper quagmire . <p> The president knows that war would be a gamble . Yet he seems truly resolved to takethe risk if Saddam does not back down . Bush is not known for vision , especially on the domestic front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's role in the world . It is the same one that inspired him to enlist as a naval aviator in 1942 at the age of 18 : to stop armed aggression . " This will not stand , " said Bush on the first weekend after Saddam seized Kuwait , and it was Clear from his tone and manner that he meant it . He is not unmindful of the costs . In a dramatic moment last week , a reporter asked Bush if he would be willing to sacrifice one of his own children to the cause . Taking off his glasses , he said , " I know what it 's like to have fallen comrades and seeing young kids die in battle . " He repeated that " this will not be a Vietnam , " and vowed to back each soldier " to the hilt with American firepower . " But he never wavered from his willingness to use force . <p> Lyndon Johnson was also a creature of the postwar world . As a congressman , he cheered when Harry Truman announced in 1947 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures . " Johnson believed that America had to stand up to aggression in Vietnam , or we will " have to pull our defenses back to San Francisco . " Yet he hated the Vietnam War from the first  --  " that bitch of a war , " he called it . He feared it would wreck his Great Societyprograms and derail his domestic agenda , along with his popularity . Johnson fancied himself a " war leader " in the mold of Lincoln and Churchill , but he refused to make . hard choices about putting the economy on a war footing or callLug up the Reserves . In the end , determined to have both guns and butter , he launched the nation on an inflationary spiral that nearly ruined the economy in the 1970s . <p> Bush does not want to repeat Johnson 's destructive dithering . One reason he wants to move quickly  --  and not wait for sanctions to work over the next year or 18 months  --  is that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was deeply affected when Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel told him last month that higher oil prices were crippling Eastern Europe 's attempts to launch a capitalist democracy . <p> Betting his presidency : The risks are enormous . Bush is betting his presidency , well aware that Vietnam cost LBJ his . If war can not be contained , if it envelops the Mideast and halts the flow of oil , recession will become world depression . But more important than the future price of oil is America 's future role in the world . Even after the United States lost Vietnam , the basic world order remained unchanged . True , America became briefly isolationist , even though George McGovern 's " Come Home America " campaign failed to win him the White House . But the basic division between East and West , and America 's role as guardian of the so-called Free World , remained unchanged . Now , with the end of the cold war , that stable , if scary , structure has been wiped away . It is up to Bush to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wins , either by bluffing him out of Kuwait or forcing him out , then collective security will have been given a critical boost . If the United States fails by loss of will or force , there will be no one to replace America as global policeman . Saddam  --  and future aggressors like him  --  will be emboldened . In a nuclear future , with even small nations armed with nuclear and chemical weapons , that will be a dangerous way indeed . The president is right that the Persian Gulf crisis is not Vietnam . In many ways , it is more important . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : In the desert of Saudi Arabia , U.S. Marine Hawk missiles <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A fighter on the deck of teh USS Midway in the Persian Gulf <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : George Bush <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The gulf 1990 : U.S soldiers with a newspaper report on the U.N . war resolution <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Vietnam 1968 : American Marines evacuate the wounded at the battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McDANIELand DOUGLAS WALLER in Washington <p> How We Would Fight by Land , Sea and Air <p> Looking for a cheap , quick kill , the Pentagon first hoped to destroy Saddam Hussein with the air option . The military estimated that in the first two or three days of an airstrike , it would lose under 7 percent of its planes to Iraqi defenses . But once the Iraqi antiaircraft batteries were destroyed and the Iraqi Air Force decimated , the loss rate would drop to .5 percent . Casualties could be held to fewer than a thousand . But during the three months it took to air- and sealift a massive force of planes , tanks and men into the desert , Saddam was able to build up  --  and dig in  --  his own forces in Kuwait . So the timetable for an air campaign kept lengthening  --  from six days to 10 days to two weeks . By mid-October , it was clear that Iraqi forces could not be destroyed by air power alone . <p> To minimize Army casualties , strategists hoped to try a flank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kuwait . One idea was to strike through southern Iraq into western Kuwait ; that terrain is too rough for tanks . The brass considered a helicopter assault , and the Marines proposed an amphibious landing at the head of the gulf to cut the supply route from Basra . But Saddam has now pulled tank forces back so far a flank attack would take Americans well into Iraq . Overextended and outmanned , light forces would be chewed up . <p> By late October it was clear the United States would have to launch a frontal attack . The cost would be high : perhaps 15 percent of the assault forces would be lost . President Bush decided to boost U.S. troop strength to more than 400,000 , and Saddam responded in kind , with plans to send an additional 150,000 soldiers into Kuwait . The 450,000-man/3,600-tank Iraqi Army now in the area is not mobile , but is well dug in . Some Iraqi defenses are overrated : trenches of burning oil can be bulldozed full of sand . But Iraqi artillery can carpet the desert with barrages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to strike by air and land . The offensive would begin with a massive aerial bombardment . At H-hour , warplanes would take out Iraqi air defenses and chemical-tipped missiles aimed at Israel , as well as Saddam 's command links to his forces . Later sorties would be aimed at destroying the Iraqi Air Force on the ground and in the air , and at pounding Iraqi troop fortications . The U.S. Air Force believes it can destroy half of Saddam 's forces within a week . In Baghdad , Saddam 's headquarters would be flattened . But in general , civilian targets and industry would be spared . At the Pentagon , military planners believe Bush would order a pause in the bombing after several days to give Saddam a chance to surrender . But White House aides insist there will be no breaks in the action  --  that once war is begun , it will be fought to the finish . The administration and the Pentagon share a belief in ultimate victory . But no one is talking anymore about a war that is short or cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> MAP : The Flank Attack ( Gulf War ) <p> MAP : The Frontal Attack ( Gulf War ) <p> By JOHN BARRY in Washington <p>
