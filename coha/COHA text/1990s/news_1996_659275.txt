ROSENBERG <p> AP Business Writer <p> Christmas 1995 was a tough time for parents and the toy industry . Everyone was tussling with the same problem : no big hits . <p> Sure , there was Holiday Barbie and the " Toy Story " toys , all in short supply . But there was little else to trigger any stampedes into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to revive for Christmas , thanks to a resurgence in video games and several big movies , including a live-action version of " 101 Dalmatians " and " Spacejam , " which stars Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters . <p> Industry watchers have even greater expectations for 1997 , with the release of a slew of big films - including the next " Batman , " with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the villain - and the re-release of the " Star Wars " trilogy to theaters . <p> " Next year is going to be spectacular . If I 'm wrong on this , I give up , " said Michael Goldstein , chief executive officer of Toys R Us Inc . <p> A sales surge would be welcomed by toy manufacturers and retailers who have endured relatively lackluster sales the past year and a half . <p> " The toy industry is struggling to find product leadership , " said John Taylor , an analyst with Arcadia Investment Co. in Portland , Ore . " It 's similar to last year . There is n't anything ( on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take on a life of its own . " <p> In other words , there 's no Power Rangers ( although they 're finding some renewed popularity , thanks to their new Zeo line ) that every child wants and that heightens demand for other toys . <p> At Toys R Us , which suffered a disappointing Christmas 1995 , " the most significant issue we 've faced is the lack of new toys , " Goldstein said . <p> Some of this year 's toys have n't met expectations . Disney 's " The Hunchback of Notre Dame " has waned at toy stores as well as at the box office . The film did not excite children as much as hits like " The Lion King " and " The Little Mermaid . " <p> When they strike the right note with children , movies and TV shows are the biggest generator of toy hits - consider how many kids had to have " Jurassic Park " and " The Lion King " toys . <p> So the movies coming out over the next 18 months are expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Independence Day , " the big hit of the summer , and the scheduled November release of the " Toy Story " video will likely boost demand for action figures ( and Slinky Dogs and Mr. Potato Heads ) tied to the films . <p> Then there are " 101 Dalmatians " and " Spacejam . " Mattel is a big manufacturer of Disney characters , and other companies that have licenses to make puppy-emblazoned toys should profit . <p> It 's hard to imagine that a movie with Michael Jordan , Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck could fail . Goldstein predicted that Playmates Toys Inc. , the company that has sold billions of dollars in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles figures , is expected to have another big hit with packages that combine figures of Michael with Looney Tunes characters . <p> Video games are reviving after two down years , helped by sales of next-generation machines like Sony Playstation . Sega 's Saturn machine is also doing well , and Taylor said software titles including Madden Football , Crash Bandicoot and Knights will be big sellers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is expected to be hot at Christmas and into 1997 . <p> " We know based on ( sales in ) Japan that this is hot , " Goldstein said . " We expect every piece of Nintendo 64 will be sold " - he paused and snapped his fingers - " just like that . " <p> Toymakers have mixed feelings about video games . Consumer dollars spent on Sega , Sony and Nintendo products mean less money for Mattel , Hasbro , Playmates , Tyco and other manufacturers . But video games get shoppers into the stores , making them more likely to buy other toys as well . <p> Among dolls , Barbie is the only one making much noise . Gymnast Barbie , timed to coincide for the Olympics , has been a good seller . For Christmas , Holiday Barbie - in short supply last year , angering many parents - is expected to be hot again . <p> " This year 's is out already , and customers are gobbling them right up , " Goldstein said . <p> Mattel , Barbie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the doll sold out , said Frank Reysen , editor of Playthings , a trade magazine . <p> " It 's so hard to predict demand , even for the best brains in the industry , " he said , rebutting contentions by some consumers that Mattel deliberately created a shortage . <p> " When we looked at the dolls and Mattel looked at them , we did n't see much difference in them " that would turn them into such a hot commodity , Goldstein said . <p> Another big trend this year is educational toys and those that provide what Reysen called quality play . Toys manufactured by companies like Learning Curve , Brio and Playmobil , as well as the Disney , Playskool and Sesame Street lines are getting more attention . So are specialty toy stores like Noodle Kidoodle . <p> But if the analysts are right , this Christmas will just be a warmup for 1997 . <p> In February , the " Star Wars " movies come out and new lines of toys will arrive in stores . What 's particularly intriguing about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movies in theaters , yet Star Wars action figures have been very popular for years . It 's easy to imagine that seeing the trilogy on the big screen will excite many kids . <p> Then , around Memorial Day , " Jurassic Park 2 " is scheduled to be released . The original film sold millions of dollars of toys , and both Taylor and Goldstein expect an encore from the sequel . <p> Next summer should bring the fourth " Batman " movie . Even if Batman himself were n't such a big draw , there is Schwarzenegger . The combo is likely to be unbeatable in the action figure category . <p> " Anastasia , " the first animated film from Fox , is also expected to have successful toy tie-ins , as are several other big movies scheduled for 1997 : " Hercules , " " Quest for Camelot " and a live-action version of " The Little Mermaid . " <p> But Goldstein noted that movies do n't automatically generate good products , even if the pictures do well . He noted that " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year did n't lend themselves to the kind of toy that children - and retailers - got ta have . <p> BLOCK 2 <p> AP Graphic <p> TEXT : <p> PARAMUS , N.J. - Perhaps the greatest gift Toys R Us Inc. got for Christmas 1994 was the gift of foresight . The big toy retailer realized it needed to make some changes . <p> " It was a pretty good year , but we did n't like the feel of what was going on , " said Michael Goldstein , the company 's chief executive officer . <p> Competitors like Baby Superstore , Wal-Mart and Kmart were taking business away . Toys R Us stores were beginning to look tired . So the company began laying plans to remake itself . <p> It was just as well , because last year turned out to be bumpy . As Toys R Us told shareholders in its annual report , " the 1995 holiday selling season was particularly difficult . " <p> Now , with another Christmas season approaching , the company expects to do better , partly because of a restructuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revamped toy store , and Babies R Us , a superstore for infant merchandise - and a streamlining of its bloated inventory . <p> Concept 2000 is the company 's code name for the Toys R Us stores of the future . The first is actually a remodeled Toys R Us in Raritan , N.J. , completed in mid-July . <p> In the parking lot , shoppers see a store with a glass front instead of brick , making the toys visible from outside , and giving the building a lighter feel . <p> Inside , the aisles have been reconfigured to make the store more spacious and less like a warehouse . Signs help shoppers see which toys are in which aisle . Cheerful displays similar to those in stores like F.A.O . Schwarz brighten the ambience . There 's merchandise that shoppers are n't accustomed to seeing at Toys R Us , such as a big display of Gund plush toys . <p> A typical Toys R Us has about 45,000 square feet , although some stores in smaller markets measure 20,000 or 30,000 square feet . Concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slowly renovate many of its other 650 stores . Every new store will be built according to the new design . <p> Results at the first Concept 2000 store are good , Goldstein said during an interview in the company 's Paramus headquarters . He rapped his knuckles on the table for luck . <p> The changes have received favorable reviews among analysts . <p> " The format is much more forward-thinking . It moves Toys R Us to the consumer of today , " said Jeffrey Feiner , an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc . <p> But Feiner also noted it 's too soon to know how fast changes can be made to the other Toys R Us stores . The company has said it expects to complete about 20 Concept 2000 stores this year , including four renovations . <p> The company has revamped its inventory focus , reducing the number of items carried , and has been running clearance sales to eliminate slower-moving merchandise . <p> Goldstein said the changes will " reduce assortments to make the stores more shoppable . " Moreover , they mean Toys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niche markets , such as adults who collect higher-end toys like $ 100 Barbie dolls . <p> As part of the inventory streamlining , Toys R Us wo n't necessarily stock every single version when manufacturers start cloning rivals ' products . Goldstein noted that after the toymaker Little Tykes introduced its Cozy Coupe car , other companies mimicked the design and Toys R Us carried eight different models . Several did n't sell well . Now the chain will carry only three or four . <p> The first Babies R Us store opened on Long Island in May . The store is a broad expansion of the infants ' departments in Toys R Us stores and the company 's Kids R Us clothing chain . The company expects to have 10 Babies R Us stores open by year-end . <p> In October , the company expects to open its first superstore , a which will encompass Concept 2000 , Kids R Us and Babies R Us . <p> End adv for release anytime
