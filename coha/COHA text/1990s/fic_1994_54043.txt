MY DRESS FOR THE BARON of Helmany 's ball was violet sateen , off the shoulders , with frothy lace cuffs to conceal my cracked fingers . It was the best I could manage in a week , sewing late at night after I finished the work I brought home from Madame Carolla 's . Libby had found ten yards of pink silk , very cheap , but unflattering to her complexion . Never mind , she said , and I whipped it up into a gown in the latest mode . She modeled it for me after her last client of the night had departed . Ella was asleep in her boxroom , safe from the improprieties of her elder sisters ; shutters rattled below stairs as the landlord closed up his tavern . The candlelight in our attic erased the imperfections from Libby 's round , heavy features : she seemed time-smoothened , a madonna of golden stone . But when she posed for me in the dress , her over-ripeness  --  the way she thrust out her chest , the coyglances  --  spoilt the illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said tentatively . <p> " Oh , do n't bother . " She waved my judgment aside . " I know it does n't suit me . But that really is n't important , as long as it does n't gape open down the back . It 'll be such fun . The other girls standing outside the gates , shivering in their bare shoulders and their openwork slippers , and me inside . For once , inside . " She twirled , ducking to avoid the sloping rafters . " I think I 've got enough put by for us to hire a carriage . I 'll wave to Francine and Sharon and Marie as they flutter their eyelashes at the fine gentlemen . " <p> I shook out my skirts and ran my fingers through my golden hair . It is my one beauty . " What about me ? Am I alluring ? " Please tell me so , I prayed . Even if it 's not true . <p> " It 's a beautiful dress , Minette , as good as anything Madame Carolla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look ? " I lifted up the hair off the back of my neck and tried to imitate her come-hither smile . " I want to be wanted , like you . . . " <p> She let out a giggle , and gathered me in her arms . Her hot breath tickled my neck , smelling faintly of codfish . " You do n't want to be like me , Minette darling . You want to be beautiful . And that 's your problem . " Disappointment hit me hard in the stomach . Libby went on , " You 're nineteen . Is n't it time to live instead of dreaming ? You do n't have to be a mousy little seamstress all your life . " <p> " I 'm so tired of being despised , " I said passionately , " I 'm jostled in the street , my purse is stolen , jokes are made about me in my hearing , because I 'm a plain , poor woman , worthy of nothing but contempt . If I looked like Ella I would be happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Libby laughed . " Darling Ella has n't got a grain of sense in her head . No , Minette , you know who my favorite sister is . " <p> " That does n't help . I want to be loved , Libby . And not just by you . " <p> Ashamed that I had confessed my secret longings , I fell silent , running my fingers over the low-quality sateen of my gown . A ray of pink dawn came through the window and made a mockery of our candle , showing up the cracks of age in Libby 's face . <p> We Ingles sisters were all born blanks . As we grew , we developed certain differences . I believe that these started with the differences in our faces . I remember Libby five years old , wriggling while Nanny dressed her in a small replica of a lady 's attire ; I , three , tumbling determinedly toward the nursery grate ; Ella cooing , pink-faced , in the midwife 's arms . The day she was born , it became clear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with equal workmanship . " I have given birth to an angel , " my mother sighed ( so Father told us ) , and curled up in the great bed , its linen all bloodstained from her birthing , and went to sleep . <p> I crept upstairs with Libby , after the relatives in their sweeping dresses of black had come and gone . We did n't understand what had happened . We pushed open the oaken door . Far away across the carpet , Mother lay between unrumpled white sheets , stiff as a clothes peg doll , unmoving , her lips slathered with scarlet to make her look alive . Her hands lay like milky glass on the sheet . Nanny in her high cap came and hustled us away . I remember the hot smell of her starch . She murmured to newborn Ella in her arms , as she swept us toward the nursery : " Poor thing , poor love-a-dove . Growing up all alone , your father a clever man , but unfit to care for so much as a mouse . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce . " Look after Baby . You two great lumps of girls , you must promise you 'll love her in place of the mother she does n't have . " <p> We stumbled over our tongues to promise . We were three and five years old . <p> And though I may complain , though I may envy her her face , I love Ella as if she were my own child . I feel a swell of pride when she walks ahead of me into the market , singing a little tune , her step jaunty , a wicker basket swinging on her arm . And the stallkeepers and matrons and beggar-boys fall silent . <p> Nanny must have known she would be dismissed . It seemed to us as if Mother 's death pulled a brick out from the bottom of Father 's elaborate financial pyramid . And indeed it was Mother who had the noble title , Father was merely a clever man . We moved to a smaller house , skimped meals , darned clothes , heated cow 's milk for Ella . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how slender a base ( like that of a gyroscope ) our luxurious lifestyle had balanced on . When I was ten , Father ceased to work , even as a solicitor , by which means he had kept up our dignity . We moved to the city . His sole comforts now were the kindness which comes in brown glass bottles  --  and Ella , who had grown into a spritely child , with hair like golden mist and eyes like summer skies . <p> When I was sixteen , the brown bottles got the better of him . We , the bereaved , leased this apartment . With every move , we had sunk lower in society , and this district is in the center of the city : riddled with vice and illicit pleasures , but possessing a veneer of patched respectability . The apartment has only three rooms , and the kitchen is no wider than an armspan , but Ella still complains how much work it is to keep house . This whining is the way , I believe , in which she works out her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the recesses of Madame Carolla 's Dress Shop . Libby works at night , in this very attic , or sometimes in alleys . She gave up hope of marrying because she had no dowry , and now she says she would n't if she were given the choice . <p> We have been here three years . <p> The Baron is a foreigner . His country lies east of here , ringed by mountains , the hills furry with trees . I have heard that his hair is the color of black earth and his eyes like sapphires . His list of ladies and gentlemen in Society must be sadly out of date , for when he prepared to hold a winter ball in our city , he sent an invitation to Father " and his lovely wife Marguerite . " It found us just a week ago , grimy and tattered . I had to give tuppence to the urchin who brought it . <p> " We deserve to go , " Libby and I told each other . " We work hard . We should give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far have been more a misery than a treat . ) " We are going . " <p> But Ella is not . All these years we have striven to preserve her innocence , and we will not have it shattered now . From our life here in Riverbank , we know the rich are more perverted than the poor , or maybe they 're just less ashamed of showing it : Libby says the lord or two she has had wanted things of her that no Riverbank man would dream of . We refuse to expose Ella to such sordidity . I may be timid , but I understand what is happening around me , I wear no rose-tinted spectacles . She knows what goes on upstairs when she is asleep , but I do n't think she envisions the act . Like a child , she romanticizes it . <p> But she was Father 's favorite , and ever since babyhood he filled her head with tales of the old life , when full-bearded gentlemen escorted tinkling ladies to dinner , and music flowed out of the windows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest disappointment of her existence . She sulks in the kitchen , pressing her face against the grimy glass , so that the prentices passing in the street gawp up at her ; and then , diverted , she flirts with them through the window . She does not understand . " I want to go , " she whines over and over . <p> We stand in the doorway with our ugly old wraps over our dresses , watching for the carriage through the gusting snow . Libby 's patience is worn to a thread . " Absolutely not , " she snaps . " Now get back upstairs , you 'll catch your death . " <p> " Minette . . . ? " Ella begged . " Pleeeease take me with you ! I want to meet a handsome noble , and marry him , and live in a mansion . . . " <p> " Good Lord , child , " I said , my voice high with excitement . " Where did you get that idea ? " <p> " I 'm not as stupid as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lantern light of the entryway , her lower lip stuck out , her brown dress cinched around the waist with Father 's old belt . " I listen to people talking . Sharon Cooke told me nobles are kinder and handsomer than Riverbank men . She said if you look pretty and can dance well , you stand a chance of netting one , no matter what your birth . " She outstretched her arms and broke into a waltz , there in the cramped passage . She would have made a brilliant danseuse , among many other things . " And anyway , I am born to it , even if our fortunes have fallen . " <p> " Oh , will you stop your capering . " Libby 's teeth chattered . She gave Ella a push . " I 've worked with Sharon many a night . She likes to believe birth does n't count , but it does . Birth and breeding . The lords might fuck her , but they would n't marry her if she was the most ravishing beauty in the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never work with you . " Libby winced involuntarily . Ella said with unintentional , adolescent cruelty , " She 's got real employment . She knows things . And she 's right ! Nothing else counts , as long as you 're pretty enough ! " <p> She fled upstairs , crying . <p> After a silence , " We do deserve it , " I repeated , trying to convince myself . " We work our hands to the bone to buy bread , while she sits at home , dusting the mantelpiece . We do deserve to go . " <p> " Yes . " Libby wiped one eye , careful not to smudge her powder . " We do . But that was hard . Here  --  here 's the carriage . " She stepped into the street and hailed it . Pulled up sharp , the horses pranced , tossing their heads , as if they considered it beneath their dignity to venture this deep into the bowels of the city . <p> Inside the carriage , I gazed up through the leaded panes . Ella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , silhouetted against the amber glow of a candle . Now and again she dabbed her eyes with her sleeve . " She 's crying , " I said . " But she knows we 're watching . Do n't fret . " My excitement was returning . Tonight , I thought , I would enjoy myself  --  and just maybe I would change my life . I did not know how or where , but perhaps I would find love . <p> Here is the story of what happened while we were at the ball , as I had it from Ella next day : <p> After we had clattered away , she being no longer observed , she started to leave the window . But the snow stopped , and she became fascinated with the shadow she cast on the white street . She got out her little treasures  --  a fan , a pair of drop earrings that had been Mother 's , a comb Father had bought her  --  and experimented with her image , piling her hair on top of her head , half-hiding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thus Duchess Chiliver saw her . The foreign Duchess was trotting along the street in her eggshell carriage , badly out of temper , late for the Baron 's ball , not even sure whether she wanted to go . ( You must understand that here I am using my imagination . ) Her coachman was new to the city , and had lost his way in the slums . " What is that enchanting little picture in the window ? " the Duchess said to her maid-in-waiting . " Stop the carriage ! Marianne , dear , go and knock on the door . " <p> " Madame , the ground is wet . I will spoil these lovely slippers you gave me . " <p> " Nonsense . It 's only snow . See what that girl really looks like if she is as lovely as her silhouette . If she 's only a courtesan whiling away time between customers , at least you can ask her which way it is out of these awful slums . " <p> When the maid was gone , the Duchess sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These locals , " she muttered to herself . " They ca n't tell a leper from a Marquise . I do hope . . . " Her entrepreneurial eye had seen a wealth of possibilities . Also an excuse for being late to the ball . She was renowned for her shrewd choice of protegees : they had become , among others , a famous ballerina and a politician 's mistress . <p> The carriage door swung open , letting in a blast of icy air . The maid 's face was bright pink , but not from the cold . " Madame , " she gasped , " you must come and see  --  " <p> Behind her , an angel hovered in the entryway , her golden hair haloed in the light . <p> THE BARON 'S mansion was outside the city , on the edge of a frozen lake . Lanterns on flower-stem-like wooden poles illuminated the lawns which sloped down to the ice . Candles garlanded the trees . The French windows stood wide open , but the house was heated so efficiently by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold to hot as if walking into a sweat-lodge . A buffet supper was spread in the dining room . In the ballroom , an orchestra played on and on and on . I thought I should never escape the strains of those minuets and fandangoes . I hear them in my head still . <p> The flounced , ruffled dresses of the Ladies and Marquises and Baronesses floated on the streams of sound , like miniature sailing ships . Supported by their upright black counterparts , they bobbed into every comer , gathered in backwaters talking animatedly , spilled out over the frost-tinged lawns . Bare arms glowed pale in the shadows where perversions were already being practiced . The faces of the women were no more extraordinary than ours : but they had the courtesan 's art of disguise . What we saw were elaborate , laughing contrivances . The men embraced them lustfully , but this seduction was itself contrived . I believe that this is why Ella was such a success . She was not contrived at all . <p> Until about eleven o'clock , Libby stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not because her gown was inferior to the ladies ' ( I keep that tiny scrap of pride ) , but because she had no one else to talk to . From the moment we came in the door , and the haughty doorman made us produce the tattered parchment to prove our identities , we were out of place , like daisies in a prize flower arrangement . The ladies embraced , the lords shook hands and exchanged glasses of champagne , we caught snatches of conversation by which we knew they had all been to the same parties last night , last week , last year . Perfumes washed over us like an aromatic rainbow . We had thought it indelicate to wear any , because Libby and the gifts outside the gates doused themselves with scent of a night , to disguise other smells . We had been wrong . <p> Every move we made seemed wrong . <p> When the Baron stretched out his hand to us , Libby grinned and kissed him on both cheeks as if they were old friends . Her smile was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . But my head was spinning , I do not know if I should have had the strength to touch him . The inside of my chest prickled slowly , in waves . My eyes were dazzled . <p> He was the most suave of all the nobles ; the most elegant of the gentlemen ; he had the most delightful foreign accent . Neat teeth , violet eyes , dark curls of hair on the backs of his hands . I had not touched him , not spoken to him nor made eye contact . I watched as he turned and bowed and kissed hands , jousting good-humoredly with his friends . I wanted to wrap myself around him . I wanted  --  I wanted  --  my stomach was hollow with wanting . <p> I was in no condition to talk . Libby 's attempts at chatter produced raised eyebrows and silences like clear puddles . Blushing , we withdrew to a dimly lit alcove behind the orchestra . Libby was subdued . I trembled gently , my mind pulsing . <p> At last Libby said , " Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know how to do one thing well , and I 'm going to do it . " <p> I clutched at her . She was my flotsam in a sea of helplessness , of melting dreams . " Do n't leave me alone ! " <p> " Do n't be so shy , Minette . If you do n't talk to the gentlemen , how are you ever going to make one love you ? " <p> " I 've given up that hope , " I said wretchedly . " I only want one , and I can never have him . " <p> " Not the Baron . Not even you are so silly . " <p> I looked up at her with guilty eagerness . She knew about men and women , perhaps she could help me . . . <p> She blew out breath in exasperation . " Oh yes , you look just like a fine lady of Helmany , " she said , and turned and strode away . <p> The group of young gentlemen she joined looked as nervous as I. Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a jot of compassion to spare for them . In the golden light of the chandeliers , I saw that Libby was presenting herself as a whore , her body language advertising it clearly in the delicate atmosphere of the ball . She captured one of the boys with ease . Heads turned as he took her arm , and I heard murmurs of surprise , but neither noble nor servant moved to throw her out . I do not think they connected her with the gauche lady who had shaken the Baron 's hand . The gap between guest and courtesan , through in private it might not exist , was publicly impossible for them to bridge . <p> The Baron stood not twenty feet from me , talking to a pretty , red-haired woman seated on a couch . She looked up into his face , her body angled toward him : at first they seemed intimate , and I could have sworn I saw them brush lips , but then one corner of his mouth developed a sardonic twist , so it seemed that he mocked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chucked the woman under the chin , quite hard , so that her head snapped back , and strolled away . The red-haired woman sat very still for a minute , then dropped her forehead to the back of the couch . <p> Libby reappeared and began to work the edges of the dance floor . From my hiding place , I saw that her lip rouge was smeared . <p> A murmur arose by the doors . I looked that way wearily , my eyes blurred with other people 's perfume and unshed tears . The guests parted to let her step onto the dance floor . Floating in a mist of naive awe , in a gown the color of her eyes , with pearls around her throat , she waved to them all , a proud little flutter of fingers . <p> " Baron , " trilled a woman 's voice , " look here at what I found , in the city , not an hour 's drive away . Does n't she remind you of my little goose girl , and the others ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white-gowned Duchess had not early on taken charge of her schedule , I think she would have given a dance to every gentleman who asked . Now and again she stopped to accept champagne from the servants , who practically crawled at her feet , grinning like pet dogs . The Marquises and Countesses watched her hostilely . Unaware that she was envied , she smiled at them all  --  and then , captivated by her sweetness , they had to smile back . She waved at Libby , and would have dashed to meet her , bubbling with excitement , but Libby ducked under people 's arms and out of the ballroom . She knew that would have been the end of Ella 's popularity . <p> " Who was that , my lady ? " a gentleman asked her . <p> Ella looked as if she were about to tell the truth , then she tittered . " Someone I thought I knew . Nobody , my lord . " <p> * * * Later , of course , she and the Baron danced . They drifted past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their blue eyes were locked . His hand trembled , splayed like a hairy starfish on her back . Ella chewed her lip . Both of them looked as if they were in pain : bruises in sensitive places , perhaps , that hurt when they moved . The orchestra played slower and slower for them , violins wailing like grasshoppers in the forests . I put my knuckles to my eyes and wept . <p> Libby appeared at my side , breathing hard . " We 're going home . " <p> " What , are n't you making as much here as you would in the Golden Hog ? " I said viciously through my tears . <p> She indicated her bosom . Five or six strands of jewels dripped into her cleavage . " They keep them in their pockets just for gifts to courtesans . No , it 's that I ca n't stand to think of you here in the shadows , crying your heart out over that ugly little Baron . Will you fetch Ella or shall I ? " <p> " How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's the most beautiful man in the room ! " <p> " He 's creel and stupid . If I did n't love Ella so much , I 'd say they suit each other nicely . But she does n't understand what she 'd be getting into , she does n't see . I would n't leave her with this lot for a minute . Look at their teeth . The minute they get her alone , they 'll tear her to pieces . " She shuddered . Her words were so heartfelt that I scrutinized the ballroom again . Everyone was watching Ella , yes . Could I possibly have misread their indulgence and admiration ? <p> " I want to watch him . " I followed the Baron with a yearning gaze . " Just a little longer . . . " <p> " Ella ! Ella ! " Libby shouted , flinging away from me . " We 're going home ! " Our sister posed on the far side of the dance floor , surrounded by a worshipful court of young gentlemen . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just slipped away for a minute to get her something . Her cheeks were flushed , her teeth flashed . " Come on , Ella ! " Libby grabbed her and started pulling her straight across the floor . <p> " No ! Do n't ! Libby  --  " <p> " We 're leaving . " <p> Ella twisted in Libby 's grasp . " Come for me , Baron ! " she cried out to the crowd . " Please ! Soon ! " <p> A bitter taste came up into my mouth . The gaudily colored dresses swam before my eyes . My head spun with the mixture of perfumes as I stumbled along in Libby 's wake . Before I knew it , we were hurrying down the broad steps , snow whirling around us . Icy cold knifed into me . " Goddamn it , where 's the carriage ? " Libby squinted left and right through the snow , gripping our hands tightly . Ella was crying , and I suspect I was too . " Coachman ! " Libby screamed . " There he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the feet of the blowing , stamping horses , and pushed us bodily into the snug interior just as a party of gentlemen burst out of the mansion . The door slammed . <p> Ella huddled small , crying uncontrollably . <p> " Whatever 's wrong ? Go , coachman ! To Riverbank ! Ella , darling , what is it ? " <p> " Leave me  --  alone ! I 've lost  --  my shoe  --  " Ella gasped . " I love him so much  --  I did n't tell him  --  goodbye  --  " <p> We knew she was not crying for want of the shoe . But one of her feet was bleeding , peeking out from under the pearl-trimmed hem , her toes cut by the gravel under the snow . <p> Madame Carolla 's shop buzzed with customers spreading gossip . The Baron of Helmany had mounted a search throughout the city . He swore he would find the girl who had dropped the slipper on the steps of his mansion , or die trying . Every golden-haired woman who aspired to a barony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoe . " It is ridiculous , " sniffed Madame Carolla . " All nobles are crazy , and those females trying on the shoe are worse . " <p> " Oh , but it 's so romantic , " said one of the girls stitching beside me . " Do you know , he says that if she does n't come to him , he will search all the houses in the city until he finds her ? " <p> When I got home , I found Ella singing and sighing in tums over the housework . Having been starved for an audience , she immediately fell to prattling about the ball , it drove me away from her , to the attic . Crushing my face into the pillow , I writhed on my bed , hating myself , hating the face that had not given me a chance to win the Baron . I would have chopped my nose off if I thought it would do any good . His face hung before me , so close I could see the wide-spaced pores in his skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libby came home at ten o'clock , unusually early . The poverty and squalor of Riverbank must have hit her especially hard after last night . I could imagine Ella 's fervid babble about the Duchess and the Baron did not go down well . " If you want the bastard so much , " I heard Libby shout , " why do n't you go and find him ; Nobody would reuse to give you a lift out of the city ! Not with that pretty face ! " <p> " But that would n't be right . It would n't be womanly . The Duchess told me all about being womanly , " Ella said  --  seriously , I believe . " You do n't know anything . " <p> " I try so hard to protect you and Minette . " Libby sounded as if she were almost crying . " And you never make it easy for me ! You never give me the least bit of thanks  --  " <p> Then I heard Ella 's footsteps running upstairs . She burst into the room , giggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Minette  --  hide me  --  " <p> A few moments passed . " It 's all right , " I said sourly . " She 's not coming after you . " <p> She poked her head up , squatting under the slope of the roof , resting her elbows on the bed . Cobwebs clung like silver hairnets to the golden mass . " That 's good , I was scared she 'd  --  Minette ? What 's wrong ? " <p> I hid my face in my arms . I could not speak . <p> She touched my shoulder . " Minette , I love you . " <p> Bitterness welled up inside me . <p> " The Baron is coming to fetch me . I can feel it in my bones . Is n't that wonderful ? Do you know what he said to me ? I love you because you are real . Mmmm . . . If he takes me to live in Helmany , you can come too . And Libby . " <p> Little sister . Oh little sister , how easily I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to help anyone who wants to poke his nose into other people 's business . The matter of the glass slipper and the vanished girl must have captured their imaginations . They quickly made the connection between the tattered invitation the Ingles sisters received a week ago , and the Baron 's search . He arrived at dawn , a few days later . A muffled cavalcade of horses and men stamped down the new-fallen snow . The Baron himself bestrode a dappled stallion . The gold thread on his riding costume glinted in the sunlight , and his handsome , cruel face was lit brightly . Looking down through the window , I knew I would have him if it killed me . He was everything I was not . I had sense enough to realize this , but I believed it meant that we would complement each other perfectly . The resolution hardened in my heart , blocking out all else . <p> Just because Ella was beautiful . . . ! Our faces weigh too much in the balance of our destinies , I thought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's here , " she said , instantly awake . <p> " Yes . " <p> " Has he seen Ella ? " <p> " No . I 'm going to pretend I 'm her . Please help me , Libby . " <p> Her hair a dark , frowsy mat , her face still thick with paint , she knelt up in bed and looked out the window . " Let me think . . . your hair 's the right color . . . " She chewed her lip . " But that 's not enough , is it ? You have to fit into the shoe . And she has such tiny feet . " <p> " I have to have him , Libby . I know I 've been ungrateful to you before  --  " I was nearly weeping with tension  --  " but please help me . . . " <p> " Oh , gladly , " she said with an inflection I could not identify , and fumbled under her mattress . " I always keep this . Just in case . " I gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give me your foot . " <p> " No , Libby . You ca n't mean that . " <p> " Do you want him as much as I think you do ? " Her voice was bitter , and even vindictive , as if she were repaying me for all the injustices I had done her . " I thought you could n't be as silly as Ella . But I was wrong . Was n't I. Wrong about you , Minette . Give me your foot . " <p> Bang ! Bang ! " Open up ! " <p> It would not be long before they woke the street . I moaned . Libby said , " Women chop off bits of themselves , push themselves apart , squeeze themselves together , singe and tease their hair , make holes in their ears , tie their feet up so they will be smaller . . . all for beauty . You saw it last night . And this is a better cause than mere looks . Is n't it ? " She sounded almost gloating as she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I was n't ! Pain was no object ! <p> I held out my foot , gritting my teeth , turning my head aside as if I feared Libby was going to take the knife to my face , uglifying me even more in exchange for my heart 's desire . <p> I stood up in the little glass slippers , tumed a circle , swaying on my feet . " It fits ! " the Baron breathed . " It is she ! My lady ! " <p> He swept me into his arms , spun me around , my head nearly bumping the ceiling of our tiny parlor . My golden hair flew loose around the veil that covered my face . Smelling him so close , I nearly fainted , and not from blood loss alone . " My love , " I whispered . <p> He made to lift the veil and kiss me , but I stopped him . Libby said swiftly , " My lord , surely you would not be so improper as to kiss your bride before the wedding . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primly crossed , on the couch . He sounded as if he were mocking her as he said , " Oh , no , mademoiselle . Of course not . " <p> But his thick , strong fingers curled mine with a suggestive pressure . One of the sentries muttered to the other , and they both snorted with laughter . <p> The mixture of pain and happiness made me so giddy I could hardly stand . <p> " Do you know what you have been concealing here ? " the Baron said to Libby . " She is a real treasure , she is nothing like the other ladies of the court . That is why I have to have her . Let us be on our way , darling . " <p> Libby embraced me at the door . She smelt of sweat , so pungent that I , rendered nauseous by my ordeal , had to hold my breath . I tasted strands of her hair . " He 's going to try to get it on in the carriage , " she hissed . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're married . He 's stupid enough not to feel the difference between your and Ella 's figures , but he ca n't miss it if he sees your face . Once the priest has his say , though , there 's not a damn thing he can do . " The carnage bells jingled impatiently . She released me ; then thought of something else and caught me back . " I love you . " She kissed my cheek , leaving a greasy lip-print . " Be happy . " <p> " Why were you goading me ? " I whispered , at the end of my strength . " You were trying to make me angry . " <p> She laughed humorlessly . " Let me tell you a secret . I wanted him too . Why did you think I kissed him in the receiving line , like a twelve-year-old girl with a crush ? But I 'm too coarse for the likes of him . It could never have happened . " <p> " Libby , " I breathed , stunned , and fell away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sinking backward into deep water . The Baron caught me and made a step with his hands , boosting me into the carriage . " Such a little foot , " he gloated . <p> As we neared the end of the street , I heard a faint scream and looked back . A golden-haired figure pelted after the carriage , a scrap of nightgown fluttering around her thighs . The Baron asked me disinterestedly whether I knew who that might be . <p> " Oh  --  " I strove to keep my voice light  --  " just my little sister . I did n't have time to say goodbye to her . No doubt she is upset . " <p> " I thought you only had one sister . No , no , love , do n't bother with explanations . " His voice was lazy . His arm went around me , his fingers kneading the soft flesh under my dress , just above my corset . I lost myself in the ecstasy of contact with him . <p> The dawn glanced red off the river . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating ineffectively on the filthy snow . The ground was already trampled , kicked up into slush by local urchins and their parents on their way to work . This was the worst part of Riverbank , too miserable to be even a little glamorous , too poverty-stricken to be respectable . <p> On the broadest thoroughfare , another carriage approached us , and halted . In the interests of courtesy we had to stop too . The Baron muttered a curse and lifted his face : he had been kissing my hair . " Probably some doddering Marquis who wants to pass the time of day , darling . But it does n't do to be discourteous . " He opened the window , letting in a rush of air so cold it froze my nostrils . <p> A plump yet drawn-looking woman leaned out of the window . " Baron ! What a relief ! I have been wandering around these slums ever since I left the mansion ! This coachman does not know the river from a blind alley . " The man sitting on the box looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duchess got home . " Can you beat the directions into his head , perhaps ? " <p> " But of course , Duchess . " The Baron beckoned me . " But first let me present my bride-to-be , Ella Laide . " <p> " You found her ! My dear ! " the Duchess squealed . But then she looked at me suspiciously , and my heart thudded . " Ella ? Is it you ? It is not . Baron , this is n't my protegee . " <p> The Baron held me away and looked at me . " Of course it is . She is wearing the slipper , and what 's more , her sister had the match to it . " <p> The Duchess gave a social laugh that had not a grain of tolerance in it . " Baron , I sometimes think you are quite empty-headed . Or are all men the same in that respect ? Of course it is n't Ella . Any fool could see that . Her sister has tricked you . " <p> The Baron 's eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help myself . Far away , church bells rang . <p> " We shall find out just who it is , then , " my husband-to-be said , and flicked the veil from my face . <p> THE SNOW burned my feet like hot coals . But it was worse torture to wear the slippers . The snow soaked through my dress , numbing my body where I leaned against the cold brick wall of a tenement . My tears froze on my cheeks . I did not think they would ever come off . <p> I smelt my own blood . Libby 's expert bandages had not stood up to my tottering on them through the crowds of workers ; they unwound and the blood flowed . I sank down among the beggars at the side of the road . The poor , truncated stumps stuck out in front of me . I could see the ends of whitish bone where my toes should be , filmed over by bright blood . The sides of my feet quivered , raw , where Libby had lopped off excess flesh . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slush up from the wheels . Wearily I looked up . I knew how infrequent nobles ' carriages were here ; and from this low vantage , I understood the starved Riverbanker 's desire to pounce on it and rape it of all it contained . <p> Hers golden , his dark brown , their heads rested side by side in the window . His arm lay along her shoulders , puffing up her hair . Her hand flew up as if in protest , he took her wrist and pulled it down . <p> They passed out of sight . The angry grumble of the thoroughfare resumed . <p> Little sister , how easy it is to hate you . I ought to feel sorry for you , because I know what you are destined for : a life of high-class abuse at the Baron 's hands in the name of love , and eventually , transformation into one of the painted ladies , those who flutter frustrated on the edge of aristocracy . Your beauty wo n't protect you . But I can only covet your fate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever I was before , but I can not accept my condition , as Libby did years ago , even though I am unable even to stand up .
