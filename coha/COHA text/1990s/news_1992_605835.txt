<p> Mile after mile , the roadsides bristle with jagged stumps  --  the remains of huge old trees hacked down and hauled away after dark . Across the country this spring , entire villages are being denuded by ax-wielding citizens obeying the anarchic new law of the land . <p> " The trees were nice , but if we do n't cut them , the bandits from the next village will do it first , " said peasant Xhavid Bagdoni as he chipped away at a stump near the village of Harizaj , south of Tirana , seeking lumber and fuel for next winter . <p> Released from nearly five decades of extreme isolation and the most savage dictatorship in Eastern Europe , Albania is now on a wild and harrowing ride between chaos and democracy . Rigid communist control has ended , but with nothing to replace it , the country is suffering from an explosion of lawlessness , and from poverty and malnutrition on a level with sub-Saharan Africa . <p> If Poland was the locomotive of democratic change in Eastern Europe , little Albania  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Society has disintegrated here , " said Eduard Selami , a leader of the opposition Democratic Party , which is hoping to win a majority over the ex-Communists in Sunday 's parliamentary elections . " When other countries in Eastern Europe began to open up 20 years ago , Albania went the other way . Now we are like people who have been in the dark for many years , blinking in the strong light . " <p> To a visitor , Tirana evokes a seedy menace . Frightened citizens skitter home by 8 p.m. , abandoning the darkened streets to armed gangs that shake down taxi drivers in front of the main hotels and abduct women walking alone or in small groups . <p> The capital 's three new private restaurants barricade their doors after dark , like medieval fortresses . Authorities estimate there has been a 70 percent surge in violent crime in the past year , including rape , gunfights and knife attacks . Meanwhile , stripped of the state terror that empowered them , police officers in baggy blue uniforms stand vacantly on city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus . <p> Outside town , unlucky motorists are forced off the road and stripped at gunpoint of wallets , cars , even clothing . A former finance minister startled one Western diplomat not long ago by pulling a gun from his jacket after dinner in the port city of Durres . It was n't a holdup . He was trying to build the diplomat 's confidence for the evening drive back to Tirana , an hour away . <p> " Before , the state was dreaded by everyone . Now , we do n't have a state , and people make their own law . Every man is his own judge , " said Gjergi Rakaj , director of Tirana 's largest textile mill . <p> At Tirana 's Hospital No. 2 , Albania 's best medical facility , the halls are dark and filthy . As in the rest of the city , electricity and running water are interrupted for hours , sometimes days . There is no disinfectant , almost no medicine , no sheets  --  much less luxuries such as respirators or heart monitors . Garbage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common toilets . Hepatitis B is rampant . <p> In the intensive care unit , long shards of broken glass poke from the entryway where armed gangsters burst in one night two weeks ago , ransacking empty medical cabinets and demanding treatment for a wounded comrade . On the neurosurgery ward , bare mattresses are occupied by the groaning victims of car accidents . Permitted for the first time in 48 years to own cars , Albanians have taken to the road with a vengeance . But the hospital has no brain scan equipment , so doctors can only guess about head injuries . <p> " I am working like a medieval doctor here , " said surgeon Emil Asadurian as he made his rounds last week . " We are underwater . " <p> Conditions are scarcely better outside . In Tirana , the water stops every day , often because thieves have stolen sections of pipe . The country 's passenger trains halted in February after thieves dismantled overhead switching equipment . <p> Three-quarters of all food consumed in the country since October has been relief aid supplied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Albania would starve . Even so , food is rationed and scarce . <p> " My husband and I spend between four and five hours a day looking for food , " said government economist Linda Xhillari . <p> In the countryside , cooperative farms that accounted for 60 percent of all arable land look like bomb sites , after " spontaneous privatization " began a year ago . Peasants not only divided land , equipment and livestock , but also stripped farm buildings of floors , window frames , roof tiles and even bricks . Former landowners have turned up too , demanding their old holdings . The chaos has reduced spring planting by at least half . <p> " We have worked 50 years for nothing , " said Dr. Asadurian . " Among poor people especially , there is a great psychosis of anger . " <p> There have been dozens of attacks on food warehouses in recent months . Goaded by empty shops , thousands of people stormed a large government storage area in the town of Kavaje in search of food . The looting went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uninterrupted by local police and security forces . Instead of food , the crowds found gallons of Italian red wine , detergent , imported ceramic tiles , sterile hypodermic needles and other goods that local Communist officials had never thought to distribute . <p> " Of course I took things , " said Astrit Merhori , standing outside the warehouse . " We all did . We had n't seen wine here in 2 1/2 years . " <p> Shortages of raw materials have crippled entire sectors of the economy . For want of dynamite , coal mines have closed . For want of coal to make steam , Cotton Mill No. 1 on the edge of Tirana furloughed 4,200 workers this week , perhaps indefinitely . <p> Nationwide , about 70 percent of the work force is idle , but by government decree continues to collect 80 percent of pay . Inflation is at 150 percent . <p> Many Albanians have invested great faith in Sunday 's elections and the Democratic Party 's ability to end the chaos and attract Western aid and investment . <p> " Long live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Azem Hajdari at an election rally in the textile mill parking lot on Wednesday . <p> " America will save us ! " the crowd shouted back . <p> In the countryside , ragged peasants explain that after the election , Albania 's Democratic Party leaders and U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III will be bringing them shoes and food . <p> Sunday 's elections will be the second since Communist President Ramiz Alia , under pressure of demonstrations , began the slow loosening of control nearly two years ago . Albania 's Communists , renamed the Socialists , won the first election in March 1991 on the strength of the rural vote . <p> The government lasted less than a month , however , toppled by a general strike . The coalition government that replaced it fell in December , when the Democrats withdrew in frustration over the Socialists ' resistance to reforms . Since then , the country has been ruled by a caretaker administration that many Albanians say has been little better than no government at all . <p> The Democrats , led by French-trained cardiologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion survey last month put their support at 55 percent . <p> " The mentality of the countryside has completely changed . The peasants are much more informed and much less fearful , " said Genc Pollo , party spokesman . <p> Socialist Party international secretary Bashkim Zeneli said this week that his party would accept the election results , even if they meant defeat . " We will be a responsible opposition , " he said . <p> But in its pre-election assessment , Washington 's International Republican Institute noted that Albanians who in past elections were proud to host polling stations in their houses now " are fearful of violence and theft . " <p> Private Western charities in Tirana decided last week to suspend their relief deliveries . The decision reflects widespread uncertainty about whether the Socialists will be willing to cede power without a struggle . <p> In an interview , Democratic Party officials insist they have no reason to believe election day will be anything but calm . Campaign rhetoric tells a different story . <p> " Save the warehouses , the shops and yourselves from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic Party 's Hajdari told the crowd at the cotton mill . " The ones who are losing power are kind of crazy now . They are like an army in retreat , destroying everything . "
