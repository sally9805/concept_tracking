Lasers embroidered the curtains with bursts of aquamarine and white to simulate lightning . An electronic hiss and crackle conjured up thunder . Billows of cloth suggested wind and rain , then fell away to reveal the swaying prow of a tempest-tossed Renaissance ship . Its captain shouted orders , wrestled with the wheel , tumbled into a make-believe sea and emerged a moment later as if dragging himself onto shore . He cried in triumph , " Sweet Jesus , I 'm alive ! " <P> The relieved laughter and sustained applause that greeted Philip Casnoff as he spoke that line were partly to honor the melodramatic stage effects . But much of the response was to salute the actor for his brave return to the stage on what was to have been opening night of the year 's biggest Broadway musical , Shogun , the Musical  --  an $8 million extravaganza of sword fights and fireflies , earthquakes and snowstorms , based on James Clavell 's best-selling novel and TV mini-series . In a preview two days before the scheduled opening , as he readied himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck on the head and knocked to the stage by a 30-lb. scenic screen that broke loose from 18 ft. overhead . The performance was immediately canceled . Fortunately , if astonishingly to onlookers , Casnoff suffered only superficial injuries and took just one day off before resuming previews for this week 's opening . Some of the metaphysically inclined credited his survival to the producers ' having brought in five Shinto priests from Japan , before performances started , to purify the Marquis Theater amid the neon honky-tonk of Times Square . Skeptics complained that the blessing should have averted the freak accident altogether . <P> The same Shinto ritual might have been helpful at the Kennedy Center in Washington , where tryouts began in August . At that point the show ran almost 3 1/2 hours . Its plot was virtually impenetrable , in part because 85% was sung rather than spoken , in part because in its conspiratorial milieu  --  the warrior era of 17th century Japan  --  good guys quite often turned into clandestine bad guys , or vice versa . Critics were harsh , but audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show averaged nearly $400,000 a week at the box office  --  almost , but not quite , enough to cover weekly operating costs for a 35-member cast , 350 costumes , 150 wigs and 140,000 lbs . of sets and equipment . <P> Meanwhile , producer Clavell and his team  --  director-choreographer Michael Smuin , adapter-lyricist John Driver and composer Paul Chihara  --  hacked away an hour of running time , primarily pageantry . A funeral procession was eliminated . A 3 1/2-minute ballad about the hero 's adulterous love was compressed to 30 seconds . A formalized yet rousing 12-minute battle scene was fought and won in five . Musical exchanges between a Portuguese trader and a Jesuit missionary became clearer and quicker as dialogue . Almost every show in tryout undergoes revision , but few weather change of this magnitude .
