" I 've lost Oscar ! I ca n't see Oscar ! " U.S. Coast Guard coxswain Curtis Dewey shouts from behind the helm of a 44-foot-long motor lifeboat . He 's steering it through a rough section at the mouth of the Columbia River . How rough ? This section is known as the Graveyard of the Pacific . " Five hundred yards port bow ! " responds fellow coxswain John Anders , pointing out into the river . Twelve-foot waves crash into the boat from all directions . Rain pounds against the windshield . The wind blows between 20 and 40 knots . Even as Dewey wipes the seawater off his glasses , more water splashes on them . Still , thanks to Anders , the boat 's lookout , Dewey spots an orange dummy , nicknamed Oscar , floating in the water ahead . " I 've got him ! " he yells . " Let 's go ! Full power !

It 's the only school in the country for rough-weather and surf-rescue operations . " It 's a big classroom out there on the water , " says Anders , a former Boy Scout from California . " You 've got a lot of surf . It tests all your skills . " The school teaches coxswains how to operate a boat and conduct a rescue during heavy weather conditions . On the first day of class , the nine students put on their insulated overalls called Mustang suits , pull on their rubber boots , strap on their helmets and jump into the cold , rough water . " We want to make sure they 're not going to ' spaz out ' on us if the boat rolls , " explains surfman instructor Kevin Clark . That could happen . The boats used by the Coast Guard are self-righting , which means they 're designed to roll over into the water and then turn back up .

Saving Lives  --  as a Team Rich Huff , an Eagle Scout from New Mex ico , has been an instructor at the school for about a year . He has per formed countless sea rescues during his 13 years in the Coast Guard . He once saved a family from near disaster when their sailboat drifted into rough water . Unfortunately , he has n't always been able to save people . When he worked in the Gulf of Mexico , a commercial vessel capsized after hitting a submerged gas line . He and his crewmen were able to pull two people to safety , but 15 died . " We stress teamwork here because it takes a team to get the mission accomplished , " Huff says . Safe and Steady " One hundred yards off the starboard beam ! " This time , it 's coxswain Greg Durstine 25 , shouting .

Curtis Dewey tries to keep the boat steady . With his crewmen unstrapped , he does n't want to make any sudden movements that could result in a real man going overboard . " The biggest concern during a man overboard is where that person is in the water , " Dewey says . " But you 've got other concerns . You 're looking for swells , for breaks , for windows ( areas of calm water ) . Anything that will allow you to maneuver the boat without putting your crew in danger . " Though Dewey is a " student , " he 's an experienced coxswain . Dewey was a Life Scout in Troop 2112 in southern California . His Scoutmaster owned a 42-foot sailboat , so he and the Scouts would often take the boat out to Catalina Island on weekends , where they would hike , fish and learn how to operate the boat . Dewey joined the Coast Guard after graduating from high school . The rewards are great he says . " You 're training every day to save people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great feeling . " When he was stationed in Astoria , Ore. , only a few miles from the Lifeboat School , Dewey was singled out by the U.S. Department of Transportation for his fine work during a man overboard situation . He and his crewman noticed a boat circling without any passengers . But despite efforts from other Coast Guard boats and helicopters , they were unable to locate anyone in the water . Finally , Dewey spotted a man barely bobbing above the ocean 's surface . Though the man had been in the water for 45 minutes , they were able to save him . " I 've had many saves , " says Dewey , who 's been in the Coast Guard for eight years , " but that was probably the best one ever .

" he shouts . There is no time to relax , however . The sea continues to rage . Huff slaps Dewey firmly on the back , then turns quickly to Durstine . " O.K. , " he says . " Your turn . " As Dewey leaps from the chair , Durstine quickly takes his spot at the wheel . Anders then heaves the dummy back into the water . " Oscar overboard ! " <p>
