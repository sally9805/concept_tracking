Birds do it . Bees do it . But dandelions do n't . The prodigious spread of these winsome weeds underscores a little-appreciated biological fact . Contrary to human experience , sex is not essential to reproduction . " Quite the opposite , " exclaims anthropologist John Tooby of the University of California at Santa Barbara . " From an engineer 's standpoint , sexual reproduction is insane . It 's like trying to build an automobile by randomly taking parts out of two older models and piecing them together to make a brand-new car . " In the time that process takes , asexual organisms can often churn out multiple generations of clones , gaining a distinct edge in the evolutionary numbers game . And therein lies the puzzle : If sex is such an inefficient way to reproduce , why is it so widespread ? <P> Sex almost certainly originated nearly 3.5 billion years ago as a mechanism for repairing the DNA of bacteria . Because ancient earth was such a violent place , the genes of these unicellular organisms would have been frequently damaged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intricate process in which one bacterium infuses genetic material into another  --  provided an ingenious , if cumbersome , solution to this problem , although bacteria continued to rely on asexual reproduction to increase their numbers . <P> Animal sex , however , is a more recent invention . Biologist Lynn Margulis of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst believes the evolutionary roots of egg and sperm cells can be traced back to a group of organisms known as protists that first appeared some 1.5 billion years ago . ( Modern examples include protozoa , giant kelp and malaria parasites . ) During periods of starvation , Margulis conjectures , one protist was driven to devour another . Sometimes this cannibalistic meal was incompletely digested , and the nuclei of prey and predator fused . By joining forces , the fused cells were better able to survive adversity , and because they survived , their penchant for union was passed on to their distant descendants . <P> From this vantage point , human sexuality seems little more than a wondrous accident , born of a kind of original sin among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was maintained over evolutionary time because it somehow enhanced survival . The mixing and matching of parental genes , they argue , provide organisms with a novel mechanism for generating genetically different offspring , thereby increasing the odds that their progeny could exploit new niches in a changing environment and , by virtue of their diversity , have a better chance of surviving the assaults of bacteria and other tiny germs that rapidly evolve tricks for eluding their hosts ' defenses . <P> However sex came about , it is clearly responsible for many of the most remarkable features of the world around us , from the curvaceousness of human &; females to the shimmering tails of peacocks to a lion 's majestic mane . For the appearance of sex necessitated the evolution of a kaleidoscope of secondary characteristics that enabled males and females of each species to recognize one another and connect .
