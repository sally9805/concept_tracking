I was dreaming of cool flesh and sheets the color of fresh blood . The phone shattered the dream , leaving only fragments , a glimpse of midnight blue eyes , hands gliding down my body , his hair flung across my face in a sweet , scented cloud . I woke in my own house , miles from Jean-Claude with the feel of his body clinging to me . I fumbled the phone from the bedside table and mumbled , " Hello . " " Anita , is that you ? " It was Daniel Zeeman , Richard 's baby brother . Daniel was twenty-four and cute as a bug 's ear . Baby did n't really cover it . Richard had been my fianc once upon a time  --  until I chose Jean-Claude over him . Sleeping with the other man put a real crimp in our social plans . Not that I blamed Richard . No , I blamed myself . It was one of the few things Richard and I still shared . I squinted at the glowing dial of the bedside clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one calls at ten after the witching hour with good news . He took a deep breath , as if preparing himself for the next line . " Richard 's in jail . " I sat up , sheets sliding in a bundle to my lap . " What did you say ? " I was suddenly wide awake , heart thudding , adrenaline pumping . " Richard is in jail , " he repeated . I did n't make him say it again , though I wanted to . " What for ? " I asked . " Attempted rape , " he said . " What ? " I said . Daniel repeated it . It did n't make any more sense the second time I heard it . " Richard is like the ultimate Boy Scout , " I said . " I 'd believe murder before I 'd believe rape . " " I guess that 's a compliment , " he said . " You know what I meant , Daniel . Richard would n't do something like that . " " I agree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " No , he 's still in Tennesse . He finished up his requirements for his master 's degree and got arrested that night . " " Tell me what happened . " " I do n't exactly know , " he said . " What do you mean ? " I asked . " They wo n't let me see him , " Daniel said . " Why not ? " " Mom got in to see him , but they would n't let all of us in . " " Has he got a lawyer ? " I asked . " He says he does n't need one . He says he did n't do it . " " Prison is full of people who did n't do it , Daniel . He needs a lawyer . It 's his word against the woman 's . If she 's local and he is n't , he 's in trouble , " " He 's in trouble , " Daniel said . " Shit , " I said . " There 's more bad news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood , clutching the phone . " Tell me . " " There 's going to be a blue moon this month . " He said it very quietly , no explanation , but I understood . Richard was an alpha werewolf . He was head of the local pack . It was his only serious flaw . We 'd broken up after I 'd seen him eat somebody . What I 'd seen had sent me running to Jean-Claude 's arms . I 'd run from the werewolf to the vampire . Jean-Claude was Master of the City of Saint Louis . He was definitely not the more human of the two . I know there is n't a lot to choose from between a bloodsucker and a flesh-eater , but at least after Jean-Claude finished feeding , there were n't chunks between his fangs . A small distinction but a real one . A blue moon meant a second full moon this month . The moon does n't actually turn blue most of the time , but it is where the old saying comes from  --  once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so . It was August , and the second full moon was only five days away . Richard 's control was very good , but I 'd never heard of any werewolf , even an Ulfric , a pack leader , who could fight the change on the night of the full moon . No matter what flavor of animal you changed into , a lycanthrope was a lycanthrope . The full moon ruled them . " We have to get him out of jail before the full moon , " Daniel said . " Yeah , " I said . Richard was hiding what he was . He taught junior high science . If they found out he was a werewolf , he 'd lose his job . It was illegal to discriminate on the basis of a disease , especially one as difficult to catch as lycanthropy , but they 'd do it . No one wanted a monster teaching their kiddies . Not to mention that the only person in Richard 's family who knew his secret was Daniel . Mom and Pop Zeeman did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . He did . " You 'll come down then , " he said . " Yeah . " He sighed . " Thanks . Mom is raising hell , but it 's not helping . We need someone here who understands the legal system . " " I 'll have a friend call you with the name of good local lawyer before I get there . You may be able to arrange bail by the time I arrive . " " If he 'll see the lawyer , " Daniel said . " Is he being stupid ? " I asked . " He thinks that having the truth on his side is enough . " It sounded like something Richard would say . There was more than one reason why we 'd broken up . He clung to ideals that had n't even worked when they were in vogue . Truth , justice , and the American way certainly did n't work within the legal system . Money , power , and luck were what worked . Or having someone on your side that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was licensed to hunt and kill vampires once a court order of execution had been issued . I was licensed in three states . Tennessee was not one of them . But cops , as a general rule , would treat an executioner better than a civilian . We risked our lives and usually had a higher kill count than they did . Of course , the kills being vamps , some people did n't count them as real kills . Had to be human for it to count . " When can you get here ? " Daniel asked . " I 've got some things to clear up here , but I 'll see you today before noon . " " I hope you can talk some sense into Richard . " I 'd met their mother  --  more than once  --  so I said , " I 'm surprised that Charlotte ca n't talk sense to him . " " Where do you think he gets this ' truth will set you free ' bit ? " Daniel asked . " Great , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've got to go . " He hung up suddenly as if afraid of being caught . His mom had probably come into the room . The Zeemans had four sons and a daughter . The sons were all six feet or above . The daughter was five nine . They were all over twenty-one . And they were all scared of their mother . Not literally scared , but Charlotte Zeeman wore the pants in the family . One family dinner and I knew that . I hung up the phone , turned on the lamp , and started to pack . It occurred to me while I was throwing things into a suitcase to wonder why the hell I was doing this . I could say that it was because Richard was the other third of a triumvirate of power that Jean-Claude had forged between the three of us . Master vampire , Ulfric , or wolf king , and necromancer . I was the necromancer . We were bound so tightly together that sometimes we invaded each other 's dreams by accident . Sometimes not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Richard was our third . I could admit to myself , if to no one else , that I still loved Richard . Not the same way I loved Jean-Claude , but it was just as real . He was in trouble , and I would help him if I could . Simple . Complicated . Hurtful . I wondered what Jean-Claude would think of me dropping everything to go rescue Richard . It did n't really matter . I was going , and that was that . But I did spare a thought for how that might make my vampire lover feel . His heart did n't always beat , but it could still break . Love sucks . Sometimes it feels good . Sometimes it 's just another way to bleed .
