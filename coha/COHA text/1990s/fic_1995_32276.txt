Rayford Steele 's mind was on a woman he had never touched . With his fully loaded 747 on autopilot above the Atlantic en route to a 6 A.M. landing at Heathrow , Rayford had pushed from his mind thoughts of his family . Over spring break he would spend time with his wife and twelve-year-old son . Their daughter would be home from college , too . But for now , with his first officer dozing , Rayford imagined Hattie Durham 's smile and looked forward to their next meeting . Hattie was Rayford 's senior flight attendant . He had n't seen her in more than an hour . Rayford used to look forward to getting home to his wife . Irene was attractive and vivacious enough , even at forty . But lately he had found himself repelled by her obsession with religion . It was all she could talk about . God was OK with Rayford Steele . Rayford even enjoyed church occasionally . But since Irene had hooked up with a smaller congregation and was into weekly Bible studies and church every Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church where people gave you the benefit of the doubt , assumed the best about you , and let you be . People there had actually asked him , to his face , what God was doing in his life . " Blessing my socks off " had become the smiling response that seemed to satisfy them , but he found more and more excuses to be busy on Sundays . Rayford tried to tell himself it was his wife 's devotion to a divine suitor that caused his mind to wander . But he knew the real reason was his own libido . Besides , Hattie Durham was drop-dead gorgeous . No one could argue that . What he enjoyed most was that she was a toucher . Nothing inappropriate , nothing showy . She simply touched his arm as she brushed past or rested her hand gently on his shoulder when she stood behind his seat in the cockpit . It was n't her touch alone that made Rayford enjoy her company . He could tell from her expressions , her demeanor , her eye contact that she at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anything more , he could only guess . And so he did . They had spent time together , chatting for hours over drinks or dinner , sometimes with coworkers , sometimes not . He had not returned so much as one brush of a finger , but his eyes had held her gaze , and he could only assume his smile had made its point . Maybe today . Maybe this morning , if her coded tap on the door did n't rouse his first officer , he would reach and cover the hand on his shoulder -- in a friendly way he hoped she would recognize as a step , a first from his side , toward a relationship . And a first it would be . He was no prude , but Rayford had never been unfaithful to Irene . He 'd had plenty of opportunities . He had long felt guilty about a private necking session he enjoyed at a company Christmas party more than twelve years before . Irene had stayed home , uncomfortably past her ninth month carrying their surprise tagalong son , Ray Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the party early . It was clear Irene noticed he was slightly drunk , but she could n't have suspected anything else , not from her straight-arrow captain . He was the pilot who had once consumed two martinis during a snowy shutdown at O'Hare and then voluntarily grounded himself when the weather cleared . He offered to pay for bringing in a relief pilot , but Pan-Continental was so impressed that instead they made an example of his self-discipline and wisdom . In a couple of hours Rayford would be the first to see hints of the sun , a teasing palette of pastels that would signal the reluctant dawn over the continent . Until then , the blackness through the window seemed miles thick . His groggy or sleeping passengers had window shades down , pillows and blankets in place . For now the plane was a dark , humming sleep chamber for all but a few wanderers , the attendants , and one or two responders to nature 's call . The question of the darkest hour before dawn , then , was whether Rayford Steele should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He suppressed a smile . Was he kidding himself ? Would someone with his reputation ever do anything but dream about a beautiful woman fifteen years his junior ? He was n't so sure anymore . If only Irene had n't gone off on this new kick . Would it fade , her preoccupation with the end of the world , with the love of Jesus , with the salvation of souls ? Lately she had been reading everything she could get her hands on about the Rapture of the church . " Can you imagine , Rafe , " she exulted , " Jesus coming back to get us before we die ? " " Yeah , boy , " he said , peeking over the top of his newspaper , " that would kill me . " She was not amused . " If I did n't know what would happen to me , " she said , " I would n't be glib about it . " " I do know what would happen to me , " he insisted . " I 'd be dead , gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly right up to heaven . " He had n't meant to offend her . He was just having fun . When she turned away he rose and pursued her . He spun her around and tried to kiss her , but she was cold . " Come on , Irene , " he said . " Tell me thousands would n't just keel over if they saw Jesus coming back for all the good people . " She had pulled away in tears . " I 've told you and told you . Saved people are n't good people , they're --  " " Just forgiven , yeah , I know , " he said , feeling rejected and vulnerable in his own living room . He returned to his chair and his paper . " If it makes you feel any better , I 'm happy for you that you can be so cocksure . " " I only believe what the Bible says , " Irene said . Rayford shrugged . He wanted to say , " Good for you , " but he did n't want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envied her confidence , but in truth he wrote it off to her being a more emotional , more feelings-oriented person . He did n't want to articulate it , but the fact was , he was brighter -- yes , more intelligent . He believed in rules , systems , laws , patterns , things you could see and feel and hear and touch . If God was part of all that , OK . A higher power , a loving being , a force behind the laws of nature , fine . Let 's sing about it , pray about it , feel good about our ability to be kind to others , and go about our business . Rayford 's greatest fear was that this religious fixation would not fade like Irene 's Amway days , her Tupperware phase , and her aerobics spell . He could just see her ringing doorbells and asking if she could read people a verse or two . Surely she knew better than to dream of his tagging along . Irene had become a full-fledged religious fanatic , and somehow that freed Rayford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something , suggest something , hint at something as he and Hattie strode through Heathrow toward the cab line . Maybe earlier . Dare he assert himself even now , hours before touchdown ?  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Next to a window in first class , a writer sat hunched over his laptop . Fie shut down the machine , vowing to get back to his journal later . At thirty , Cameron Williams was the youngest ever senior writer for the prestigious Global Weekly . The envy of the rest of the veteran staff , he either scooped them on or was assigned to the best stories in the world . Both admirers and detractors at the magazine called him Buck , because they said he was always bucking tradition and authority . Buck believed he lived a charmed life , having been eyewitness to some of the most pivotal events in history . A year and two months earlier , his January 1 cover story had taken him to Israel to interview Chaim Rosenzweig and had resulted in the most bizarre event he had ever experienced . The elderly Rosenzweig had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of Global Weekly . Its staff had customarily steered clear of anyone who would be an obvious pick as Time 's Man of the Year . But Rosenzweig was an automatic . Cameron Williams had gone into the staff meeting prepared to argue for Rosenzweig and against whatever media star the others would typically champion . He was pleasantly surprised when executive editor Steve Plank opened with , " Anybody want to nominate someone stupid , such as anyone other than the Nobel prizewinner in chemistry ? " The senior staff members looked at each other , shook their heads , and pretended to begin leaving . " Put the chairs on the wagon , the meetin ' is over , " Buck said . " Steve , I 'm not angling for it , but you know I know the guy and he trusts me . " " Not so fast , Cowboy , " a rival said , then appealed to Plank . " You letting Buck assign himself now ? " " I might , " Steve said . " And what if I do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a science story , " Buck 's detractor muttered . " I 'd put the science writer on it . " " And you 'd put the reader to sleep , " Plank said . " C'm on , you know the writer for showcase pieces comes from this group . And this is not a science piece any more thin the first one Buck did on him . This has to be told so the reader gets to know the man and understands the significance of his achievement . " " Like that is n't obvious . It only changed the course of history . " " I 'll make the assignment today , " the executive editor said . " Thanks for your willingness , Buck . I assume everyone else is willing as well . " Expressions of eagerness filled the room , but Buck also heard grumbled predictions that the fair-haired boy would get the nod . Which he did . Such confidence from his boss and competition from his peers made him all the more determined to outdo himself with every assignment . In Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosenzweig in the same kibbutz on the outskirts of Haifa where he had interviewed him a year earlier . Rosenzweig was fascinating , of course , but it was his discovery , or invention -- no one knew quite how to categorize it -- that was truly the " newsmaker of the year . " The humble man called himself a botanist , but he was in truth a chemical engineer who had concocted a synthetic fertilizer that caused the desert sands of Israel to bloom like a greenhouse . " Irrigation has not been a problem for decades , " the old man said . " But all that did was make the sand wet . My formula , added to the water , fertilizes the sand , " Buck was not a scientist , but he knew enough to shake his head at that simple statement . Rosenzweig 's formula was fast making Israel the richest nation on earth , far more profitable than its oil-laden neighbors . Every inch of ground blossomed with flowers and grains , including produce never before conceivable in Israel . The Holy Land became an export capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment . Everyone prospered . The prosperity brought about by the miracle formula changed the course of history for Israel . Flush with cash and resources , Israel made peace with her neighbors . Free trade and liberal passage allowed all who loved the nation to have access to it . What they did not have access to , however , was the formula . Buck had not even asked the old man to reveal the formula or the complicated security process that protected it from any potential enemy . The very fact that Buck was housed by the military evidenced the importance of security . Maintaining that secret ensured the power and independence of the state of Israel . Never had Israel enjoyed such tranquility . The walled city of Jerusalem was only a symbol now , welcoming everyone who embraced peace . The old guard believed God had rewarded them and compensated them for centuries of persecution . Chaim Rosenzweig was honored throughout the world and revered in his own country . Global leaders sought him out , and he was protected by security systems as complex as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became with newfound glory , the nation 's leaders were not stupid . A kidnapped and tortured Rosenzweig could be forced to reveal a secret that would similarly revolutionize any nation in the world . Imagine what the formula might do if modified to work on the vast tundra of Russia ! Could regions bloom , though snow covered most of the year ? Was this the key to resurrecting that massive nation following the shattering of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ? Russia had become a great brooding giant with a devastated economy and regressed technology . All the nation had was military might , every spare mark going into weaponry . And the switch from rubles to marks had not been a smooth transition for the struggling nation . Streamlining world finance to three major currencies had taken years , but once the change was made , most were happy with it . All of Europe and Russia dealt exclusively in marks . Asia , Africa , and the Middle East traded in yen . North and South America and Australia dealt in dollars . A move was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations that had reluctantly switched once were loath to do it again . Frustrated at their inability to profit from Israel 's fortune and determined to dominate and occupy the Holy Land , the Russians had launched an attack against Israel in the middle of the night . The assault became known as the Russian Pearl Harbor , and because of his interview with Rosenzweig , Buck Williams was in Haifa when it happened . The Russians sent intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear-equipped MiG fighter-bombers into the region . The number of aircraft and warheads made it clear their mission was annihilation . To say the Israelis were caught off guard , Cameron Williams had written , was like saying the Great Wall of China was long . When Israeli radar picked up the Russian planes , they were nearly overhead . Israel 's frantic plea for support from her immediate neighbors and the United States was simultaneous with her demand to know the intentions of the invaders of her airspace . By the time Israel and her allies could have mounted anything close to a defense , it was obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had only moments before the destruction would begin . There would be no more negotiating , no more pleas for a sharing of the wealth with the hordes of the north . If the Russians meant only to intimidate and bully , they would not have filled the sky with missiles . Planes could turn back , but the missiles were armed and targeted . So this was no grandstand play designed to bring Israel to her knees . There was no message for the victims . Receiving no explanation for war machines crossing her borders and descending upon her , Israel was forced to defend herself , knowing full well that the first volley would bring about her virtual disappearance from the face of the earth . With warning sirens screaming and radio and television sending the doomed for what flimsy cover they might find , Israel defended herself for what would surely be the last time in history . The first battery of Israeli surface-to-air missiles hit their marks , and the sky was lit with orange-and-yellow balls of fire that would certainly do little to slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Those who knew the odds and what the radar screens foretold interpreted the deafening explosions in the sky as the Russian onslaught . Every military leader who knew what was coming expected to be put out of his misery in seconds when the fusillade reached the ground and covered the nation . From what he heard and saw in the military compound , Buck Williams knew the end was near . There was no escape . But as the night shone like day and the horrific , deafening explosions continued , nothing on the ground suffered . The building shook and rattled and rumbled . And yet it was not hit . Outside , warplanes slammed to the ground , digging craters and sending burning debris flying . Yet lines of communication stayed open . No other command posts had been hit . No reports of casualties . Nothing destroyed yet . Was this some sort of a cruel joke ? Sure , the first Israeli missiles had taken out Russian fighters and caused missiles to explode too high to cause more than fire damage on the ground . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corps ? Radar showed they had clearly sent nearly every plane they had , leaving hardly anything in reserve for defense . Thousands of planes swooped down on the tiny country 's most populated cities . The roar and the cacophony continued , the explosions so horrifying that veteran military leaders buried their faces and screamed in terror . Buck had always wanted to be near the front lines , but his survival instinct was on full throttle . He knew beyond doubt that he would die , and he found himself thinking the strangest thoughts . Why had he never married ? Would there be remnants of his body for his father and brother to identify ? Was there a God ? Would death be the end ? He crouched beneath a console , surprised by the urge to sob . This was not at all what he had expected war to sound like , to look like . He had imagined himself peeking at the action from a safe spot , recording in his mind the drama . Several minutes into the holocaust , Buck realized he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravado , only uniqueness . He would be the only person in this post who would see and know what killed him . He made his way to a door on rubbery legs . No one seemed to notice or care to warn him . It was as if they had all been sentenced to death . He forced open the door against a furnace blast and had to shield his eyes from the whiteness of the blaze . The sky was afire . He still heard planes over the din and roar of the fire itself , and the occasional exploding missile sent new showers of flame into the air . He stood in stark terror and amazement as the great machines of war plummeted to the earth all over the city , crashing and burning . But they fell between buildings and in deserted streets and fields . Anything atomic and explosive erupted high in the atmosphere , and Buck stood there in the heat , his face blistering and his body pouring sweat . What in the world was happening ? Then came chunks of ice and hailstones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head with his jacket . The earth shook and resounded , throwing him to the ground . Facedown in the freezing shards , he felt rain wash over him . Suddenly the only sound was the fire in the sky , and it began to fade as it drifted lower . After ten minutes of thunderous roaring , the fire dissipated , and scattered balls of flame flickered on the ground . The firelight disappeared as quickly as it had come . Stillness settled over the land . As clouds of smoke wafted away on a gentle breeze , the night sky reappeared in its blue-blackness and stars shone peacefully as if nothing had gone awry . Buck turned back to the building , his muddy leather jacket in his fist . The doorknob was still hot , and inside , military leaders wept and shuddered . The radio was alive with reports from Israeli pilots . They had not been able to get airborne in time to do anything but watch as the entire Russian air offensive seemed to destroy itself . Miraculously , not one casualty was reported in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious malfunction had caused missile and plane to destroy each other . But witnesses reported that it had been a firestorm , along with rain and hail and an earthquake , that consumed the entire offensive effort . Had it been a divinely appointed meteor shower ? Perhaps . But what accounted for hundreds and thousands of chunks of burning , twisted , molten steel smashing to the ground in Haifa , Jerusalem , Tel Aviv , Jericho , even Bethlehem -- leveling ancient walls but not so much as scratching one living creature ? Daylight revealed the . carnage and exposed Russia 's secret alliance with Middle Eastern nations , primarily Ethiopia and Libya . Among the ruins , the Israelis found combustible material that would serve as fuel and preserve their natural resources for more than six years . Special task forces competed with buzzards and vultures for the flesh of the enemy dead , trying to bury them before their bones were picked clean and disease threatened the nation . Buck remembered it vividly , as if it were yesterday . Had he not been there and seen it himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took more than he had in him to get any reader of Global Weekly to buy it either . Editors and readers had their own explanations for the phenomenon , but Buck admitted , if only to himself , that he became a believer in God that day . Jewish scholars pointed out passages from the Bible that talked about God destroying Israel 's enemies with a firestorm , earthquake , hail , and rain . Buck was stunned when he read Ezekiel 38 and 39 about a great enemy from the north invading Israel with the help of Persia , Libya , and Ethiopia . More stark was that the Scriptures foretold of weapons of war used as fire fuel and enemy soldiers eaten by birds or buried in a common grave . Christian friends wanted Buck to take the next step and believe in Christ , now that he was so clearly spiritually attuned . He was n't prepared to go that far , but he was certainly a different person and a different journalist from then on . To him , nothing was beyond belief .  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rayford Steele felt an irresistible urge to see Hattie Durham right then . He unstrapped himself and squeezed his first officer 's shoulder on the way out of the cockpit . " We 're still on auto , Christopher , " he said as the younger man roused and straightened his headphones . " I 'm gon na make the sunup stroll . " Christopher squinted and licked his lips . " Does n't look like sunup to me , Cap . " " Probably another hour or two . I 'll see if anybody 's stirring anyway . " " Roger . If they are , tell ' em Chris says , Hey . ' " Rayford snorted and nodded . As he opened the cockpit door ; Hattie Durham nearly bowled him over . " No need to knock , " he said . " I 'm coming . " The senior flight attendant pulled him into the galleyway , but there was no passion in her touch . Her fingers felt like talons on his forearm , and her body shuddered in the darkness . " Hattie --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face close to his . Had she not been clearly terrified , he might have enjoyed this and returned her embrace . Her knees buckled as she tried to speak , and her voice came in a whiny squeal . " People are missing , " she managed in a whisper , burying her head in his chest . He took her shoulders and tried to push her back , but she fought to stay close . " What do you m --  ? " She was sobbing now , her body out of control . " A whole bunch of people , just gone ! " " Hattie , this is a big plane . They 've wandered to the lavs or --  " She pulled his head down so she could speak directly into his ear . Despite her weeping , she was plainly fighting to make herself understood . " I 've been everywhere . I 'm telling you , dozens of people are missing . " " Hattie , it 's still dark . We 'll find --  " " I 'm not crazy ! See for yourself ! All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a joke . They 're hiding , trying to --  " " Ray ! Their shoes , their socks , their clothes , everything was left behind . These people are gone ! " Hattie slipped from his grasp and knelt whimpering in the corner . Rayford wanted to comfort her , to enlist her help , or to get Chris to go with him through the plane . More than anything he wanted to believe the woman was crazy . She knew better than to put him on . It was obvious she really believed people had disappeared . He had been daydreaming in the cockpit . Was he asleep now ? He bit his lip hard and winced at the pain . So he was wide awake . He stepped into first class , where an elderly woman sat stunned in the predawn haze , her husband 's sweater and trousers in her hands . " What in the world ? " she said . " Harold ? " Rayford scanned the rest of first class . Most passengers were still asleep , including a young man by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But indeed several seats were empty . As Rayford 's eyes grew accustomed to the low light , he strode quickly to the stairway . He started down , but the woman called to him . " Sir , my husband --  " Rayford put a finger to his lips and whispered , " I know . We 'll find him . I 'll be right back . " What nonsense ! he thought as he descended , aware of Hattie right behind him . " We 'll find him " ? Hattie grabbed his shoulder and he slowed . " Should I turn on the cabin lights ? " " No , " he whispered . " The less people know right now , the better . " Rayford wanted to be strong , to have answers , to be an example to his crew , to Hattie . But when he reached the lower level he knew the rest of the flight would be chaotic . He was as scared as anyone on board . As he scanned the seats , he nearly panicked . He backed into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheek . This was no joke , no trick , no dream . Something was terribly wrong , and there was no place to run . There would be enough confusion and terror without his losing control . Nothing had prepared him for this , and he would be the one everybody would look to . But for what ? What was he supposed to do ? First one , then another cried out when they realized their seatmates were missing but that their clothes were still there . They cried , they screamed , they leaped from their seats . Hattie grabbed Rayford from behind and wrapped her hands so tight around his chest that he could hardly breathe . " Rayford , what is this ? " He pulled her hands apart and turned to face her . " Hattie , listen . I do n't know any more than you do . But we 've got to calm these people and get on the ground . I 'll make some kind of an announcement , and you and your people keep everybody in their seats . OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . As he edged past her to hurry back to the cockpit , he heard her scream . So much for calming the passengers , he thought as he whirled to see her on her knees in the aisle . She lifted a blazer , shirt and tie still intact . Trousers lay at her feet . Hattie frantically turned the blazer to the low light and read the name tag . " Tony ! " she wailed . " Tony 's gone ! " Rayford snatched the clothes from her and tossed them behind the bulkhead . He lifted Hattie by her elbows and pulled her out of sight . " Hattie , we 're hours from touchdown . We ca n't have a planeload of hysterical people . I 'm going to make an announcement , but you have to do your job . Can you ? " She nodded , her eyes vacant . He forced her to look at him . " Will you ? " he said . She nodded again . " Rayford , are we going to die ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . " But he was n't sure of anything . How could he know ? He 'd rather have faced an engine fire or even an uncontrolled dive . A crash into the ocean had to be better than this . How would he keep people calm in such a nightmare ? By now keeping the cabin lights off was doing more harm than good , and he was glad to be able to give Hattie a specific assignment . " I do n't know what I 'm going to say , " he said , " but get the lights on so we can make an accurate record of who 's here and who 's gone , and then get more of those foreign visitor declaration forms . " " For what ? " " Just do it . Have them ready . " Rayford did n't know if he had done the right thing by leaving Hattie in charge of the passengers and crew . As he raced up the stairs , he caught sight of another attendant backing out of a galleyway , screaming . By now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane unaware of what was happening . Worse , Rayford had told Hattie he did n't know what was happening any more than she did . The terrifying truth was that he knew all too well . Irene had been right . He , and most of his passengers , had been left behind .
