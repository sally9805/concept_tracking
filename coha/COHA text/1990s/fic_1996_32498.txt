America 's mice have a government , too With Presidents , Senators and Congressmice , who Are elected , debate , vote the popular will -- It 's a Rodent Republic on Capitol Hill ! There 's a Capitol there that looks just like our own -- A Mouse House and Senate , of column and stone . Mouse masons and workers copied every detail , From the tip of the dome , down to every last nail ! One day in Moussouri , a wonderful state , A teacher , Miss Tuftmouse , at about half past eight , Told her class , " Settle down , everyone , sit up straight ! There 's a special assignment , and it must not be late ! " " The class , altogether , for worse or for better , Must write to our Congress an interesting letter . You ought to get started , not later , but soon , For you must turn it in by this Thursday at noon ! " Well , the children , excited , did not waste a minute , Working hard on their letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , they wrote and they read . Then the letter was finished , and here 's what it said : DEAR CONGRESS , WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE , IF YOU PLEASE , A LAW TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL CHEESE WE LIKE THIS IDEA . WE HOPE IT WILL PASS . YOURS SINCERELY , MISS TUFTMOUSE 'S SECOND GRADE CLASS Miss Tuftmouse , of course , gave the letter an A ' And mailed it to Congress the very next day , Where it went to the mail room , where mail comes in crates , From Moussouri , Moussissippi and other mouse states . The Postmouster took to Longworth McMouse , The capable , confident Squeaker of the House . A copy was rushed across to the Senate , To the Mouse-jority Leader , Russell Mouse Bennett . Then Longworth called Russell as quick as a blink : " A National Cheese -- well , what do you think ? " " Good idea ! " the Mouse-jority Leader said back . " We 'll draw up a bill to get it on track ! " To make a new law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document written with care and with skill . To find the right words , mouse assistants begin At the Library of Congress , and the books found within Next a " committee " considers the bill , For it just is n't finished or ready until The members discuss it , make changes and more , Then finally send it along to the floor . That 's the floor of each chamber , the Senate and House -- That 's where each Senator and each Congressmouse Gets to vote on the bill , and if enough do , The President signs it , if he likes it , too . But it 's not always easy for all to agree On just what a bill should do , say or be . For example , the bill for a National Cheese Caused a big disagreement , a lot of unease ! Some mice wanted Cheddar to take the top spot -- Some mice wanted Roquefort , but others said not ! Some said Parmesan , some could n't care less -- So many opinions , and such a big mess ! Just when it seemed things could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squeaker To gather the brightest on Capitol Hill To figure out how they could rescue the bill ! The Rotunda was packed -- a good place to meet -- When Senator Thurmouse rose to his feet . The oldest and wisest in Congress by years -- The Squeaker , the Leader , the rest were all ears ! " Our Mouse Founding Fathers , " he said , " were so wise -- They founded our nation around compromise ! They wrote it all down in the Mouse Constitution , So after much thought , I propose this solution : We are city mice , country mice , large mice and small -- We like many cheeses -- in fact , like them all ! But we 're Americans first ! So now , if you please , Let 's agree that American is our National Cheese ! " " Bravo ! " they all shouted . " Hooray ! " they yelled twice . " What a good compromise , what terrific advice ! " In the House and the Senate , it passed right away , And the President signed it the very next day ! And back in Moussouri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmhearted . " Look , children , look , " she said , " is n't it grand ? We live in a wonderful , wonderful land ! " Historical Notes for Parents and Teachers In 1792 , the new government of the United States held a contest for the design of a Capitol for the young nation . William Thorton , a doctor and amateur architect , submitted the winning design , and in September 1793 , President Washington laid the cornerstone of the building . The north wing was the first part finished , in 1800 . In 1807 , the south wing was completed . The two wings were separated by a vacant yard that was the site for the domed center . By 1811 , most of the work on the two wings was done . But with war with England imminent , the Americans ceased further construction . In 1814 , during the War of 1812 , the British captured Washington , D.C. , and set fire to the Capitol and other buildings . The structures were saved from total destruction only by a sudden rainstorm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1819 . The center opened in 1826 , joining the two wings . The original dome was low , built of copper and wood . But by 1850 , with the nation growing so quickly , the government had approved plans to design and construct two new , larger wings to accommodate the expanding Congress . The architects quickly realized that the longer building would make the low dome look out of proportion , so Congress appropriated additional money for a new , taller dome . The House moved into the new south wing in 1857 ; the Senate moved into the new north wing in 1859 . Work on a tall cast-iron dome continued during the Civil War , and it was finished and capped with the ITLStatue of FreedomITL in late 1863 . Despite the war , President Lincoln insisted that the construction go on -- he felt the work would be a symbol to the people that the Union would go on as well . Illustrator Cheryl Shaw Barnes spent many days on Capitol Hill researching the art and architecture of the buildings there for this book . She also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Capitol . All of the illustrations are based on actual structures , rooms , furnishings and artworks . In the book , the United Mice of America have built their own miniature Capitol . Our Capitol building is a work of art , with many painted walls and frescoes ; famous paintings , statues and sculpture are everywhere . The building has a floor area of 16.5 acres and has 540 rooms , 658 windows and 850 doorways . Later in the story , the children 's letter arrives in the House mail room . At the time of the authors ' research , the mail room was located in the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill . Now it is located in the nearby Ford House Office Building . The Longworth Building is still home to the beautiful Ways and Means Committee Room , where the congressmice review the National Cheese bill . Unlike members of the House , Senators have their own desks in the Senate chamber . Many of the desks have a special history . For example , in some , senators have carved their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back row is the " Candy Desk , " stocked with a good supply of sweets for members . In the story , when the bill is in trouble , the Squeaker and Mouse-jority Leader meet in the magnificent President 's Room , off the Senate floor . The room , known as the " Gem of the Capitol , " was constructed in the 1850s and is decorated with frescoes and oil paintings ( the portraits represent the members of George Washington 's first cabinet ) . Until the 1930s , the room was often used by presidents for signing bills ; the mahogany table they sat at still stands under the great crystal and bronze chandelier . To settle the disagreement over the bill , the lawmakers gather in the mouse Capitol Rotunda . The real Rotunda is 96 feet in diameter ; the canopy is 180 feet from the floor . In 1865 , Italian-American artist Constantino Brumidi painted a 4,664-squarefoot fresco on the canopy , ITLThe Apotheosis of George WashingtonITL , which honors the life of the first president . Other famous works of art , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang from the Rotunda wall . In the story , the illustration of the mouse Founding Fathers is based on Howard Chandler Christy 's ITLScene at the Signing of the ConstitutionITL ( 1940 ) , which hangs in the east stairway of the House wing . The 20 x 30 foot canvas is the largest painting in the Capitol . When the mouse Congress passes the National Cheese bill , members go to the White House for the signing ceremony in the Oval Office with the mouse president , Woodrow G. Washingtail . ( He is the main character of the authors ' first Washington , D.C. , book , ITLWoodrow , the White House MouseITL . ) Woodrow signs the bill at the Resolute Desk , a special desk used by many presidents over the years . It was built from the oak timbers of the British ship ITLResoluteITL . The desk was given as a present to President Hayes by Queen Victoria in 1880 , after the stranded ship was recovered in the Arctic by American whalers and returned to England .

How a Bill Becomes a Law The idea for a bill can come from many places : from a letter from a second grade class ; from a voter ; from a member of the House or Senate ; or from someone who works on a member 's staff . But once the research is done , the bill can be introduced only by a member of Congress . The bill is first referred to a committee , a smaller group of members who specialize in the issue that is addressed in the proposed legislation -- the House Ways and Means Committee , for example , specializes in taxes , health care , trade , welfare and Social Security . But the committee usually refers the bill to an even smaller group , a subcommittee , for close review . The subcommittee or full committee will hold hearings on the bill , taking testimony or other input from experts , the administration , interest groups and the public . Once the hearings are completed , the bill is " marked up " with changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of committee if it is approved by a majority of members . The bill is then put on the chamber calendar for debate and voting . Each bill must be approved by both chambers , often twice . The first time , each chamber usually votes on its own version of the bill . Then members from the House and Senate meet in a " conference committee " to negotiate the differences . Once they do , the bill is returned to each chamber for final approval and sent to the president , who can sign or veto it . If vetoed , a bill can still become a law with , a two-thirds vote of Congress .
