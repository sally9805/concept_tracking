Section : THE Watercolor PAGE <p> New and distant places can so influence personal sources of creativity that their impact lingers long after the trip is over . This happened to me upon my return from an excursion to Asia last year . The journey included several weeks in the city of Hong Kong and a couple of days in the mountains near the town of Guilin in southeastern China . With the prospect of a lot of free time at my disposal , I packed a sketchbook , pens , and my 35mm Nikon camera  --  and deliberately left my watercolors at home . Here was an opportunity to explore other media and postpone painting with my favorite medium until my return home . HIGH OVER HONG KONG <p> As a visual experience , Hong Kong is as exciting as it gets . Its scale , energy , and dense humanity make Manhattan look like a backwater . While the city can overwhelm some visitors , I was blessed with a knowledgeable friend whose curiosity had led her to the far corners of Hong Kong and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced me to all the places tourists like to visit , along with other lesser known sections of the city . My sketches and photographs included vignettes of the endless urban landscape  --  its skyscrapers , temples , markets , bays , waterways , and mountains framing the city . <p> I spent hours sketching , fully tolerated by Hong Kong 's cosmopolitan residents . In addition , my friend 's apartment rose high above Hong Kong Island , affording such fantastic views that I found myself bouncing out of bed at dawn to draw by the windows . From this perspective , I could view the water to one side , a parade of skyscrapers and the diagonal of Victoria Peak on the other . JOURNEY THROUGH GUILIN <p> After a few weeks , we flew to Guilin , the departure point for tours through the fabled sugar-loaf mountains of southern China . Our sojourn provided a welcome respite from the rigors of city living , particularly for this rural upstate New Yorker . The highlight of a visit to Guilin is the day cruise along the Liang River . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fisherfolk at work , and traditional villages unfolded before us . It was easy to understand why similar panoramas have inspired Chinese artists for centuries . I felt as though we had been thrust into the midst of a lovely scroll painting . Needless to say I nearly exhausted myself making sketches . My camera came in handy when the succession of changing views became overwhelming . BACK HOME <p> Now that I have been home for a year , the odyssey continues . The sketches and photographs from my trip trigger my creativity , resulting in many efforts at capturing the essence of Asia . I work sequentially , from a fairly realistic starting point to abstract forms of expression . In particular , I am fascinated by the dense volumes , vivid color , and staccato rhythms of Hong Kong 's narrow streets , buildings , and interiors . As a watercolorist , I am painting with hues I rarely used before  --  viridian , golds , and rich reds . Juxtaposed against dark grounds or interiors , these colors summarize for me the history , achievements , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the material from Guilin has inspired both realistic interpretations and small abstractions . Some scenes were perfect in their own right , so I interpreted them in a straightforward approach . Yet the lyrical , calligraphic grace of mountains and rivers compelled me to explore both paperweaving and collage . Paperweaving is an approach I developed accidentally about 10 years ago ( see " Expressing Energy With Woven Textures , " by Nancy Neaher Maas , Watercolor , summer 1996 ) . The surface vibrates , lending an animated quality to an image . At the same time the gridlike format stabilizes the composition . This approach seems a particularly appropriate way to blend the rapidly running waters of one of China 's formidable , flood-prone rivers with the age-old presence of traditional residences set along its banks . <p> In contrast , the collages play with the fantastic " loops " of the mountain profiles . They emphasize their astonishing curves , setting off an adventure in asymmetry and motion . Indeed , Guilin was the perfect subject for watercolor . No wonder the Chinese have relied on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this continually changing , diaphanous landscape . <p> Although I do not know where this material will take me next , I relish the open-ended quality of this creative odyssey . But that does not mean that the world around me no longer inspires my art . Rather , I believe that I , like most artists , require both the familiar and the new to stimulate my creativity . TRAVELING LIGHT <p> I kept art supplies to a bare minimum on this trip to avoid lugging extra weight , and because I did n't know how much rime I would actually have to work onsite . Even though I ended up having plenty of time , the supplies I brought ( listed below ) proved to be more than sufficient . <p> Sketchbook : ring-bound , 5 " x 7 " , with good paper . Small , but portable and unobtrusive . <p> Ultra-fine Sharpie pens : Great for gut drawings because no erasure is possible . They also prevented me from using subtle gradations of light and color , forcing me to concentrate on strong patterns of lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lens ) : I use 4 " - x- 6 " prints as memory devices . While slide film might be a useful alternative , the perfection of a slide image can sometimes be intimidating . I usually avoid collecting source materials so precise that they inhibit my own creative response to a place . <p> Cray-Pas : These were my one failing , as they were too greasy for the paper I brought . For my own personal growth , I found it was better to limit myself to black and white . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Liang River , 1996 , watercolor paperweaving , 11 x 15 .
