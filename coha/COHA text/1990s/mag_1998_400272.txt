Filled with annuals and perennials , the bed is overflowing with color that will last throughout the summer // Sharon Whittington is a downin-the-dirt gardener . " In my dreams , I see flowers everywhere , " she says . She loves to work on a garden project from start to finish , all by herself . But , she 's also busyand on a budget . Sharon and her husband , Allen , have developed a plan for their landscape and tackle it one project at a time . The new garden was part of that plan . DRAWING THE LINE The Whittingtons wanted the shape of the new garden to complement the projects they had already completed . Thus , the arbor mirrors the arched shape of the front door , and the fence was placed with a gentle curve to make a welcoming frame for the new garden . By giving the front of the bed a curved edge , the appearance is casual and reflects the style of the house . Sharon got out the hose and set to work . She placed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved it around until the shape of the bed was exactly as she wanted . Once the boundaries of the garden were determined , Sharon sprayed landscape paint to outline the space . FROM SOD TO SOIL " Over time , I 've learned the difference between a fair garden and a great garden is the soil , " says Sharon . " It 's worth taking the time to do it right . " First , she sprayed an herbicide to kill the grass . In about two weeks the garden was ready to till . Using a spade , Sharon dug a shallow trench outlining the border . Then , she loosened the old turf with a garden fork . Sand and compost were raked over the surface of the garden to amend the soil . After running the tiller over the bed several times , she raked it smooth . It was ready to plant . ( To page ss ) LOOKS LIKE A MILLION Now Sharon was faced with a large empty planting bed ( 22 feet long and 4 to 8 feet wide ) . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all , " she confesses . " I have to go with something specific in mind . " Her goal was to find maximum flower power for minimal cost . Sharon first considered her garden 's growing conditions . Most of the bed receives about six hours of direct sunlight , but it also curves under some trees at its western end . She needed flowers for full sun and partial shade . She also wanted continuous blooms from the time she planted until the first frost of fall . She discovered a range of economical plants that grow big and bushy or provide nonstop flowers . See her shopping list below . In addition , she wanted a few flowers for cutting . Globe amaranth ( Gomphrena globosa ) , annual blackeyed Susans ( Rudbeckia hirta ) , and Envy zinnias did the trick . WEATHER OR NOT Although her plant choices were excellent , the weather interfered . The annual black-eyed Susans and the Envy zinnias did not last the entire summer and had to be replaced . The globe amaranth never thrived and also had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more predictable . In midsummer , the butterfly bush began to bloom , and the Snow Nymph salvia filled out to add a light look to the garden . The spider flower bloomed , and Sharon 's plan finally fell into place .
