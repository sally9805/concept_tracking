1 The Amazon Basin , September 1987 At noon , the clouds clinging to the top of Cerro Gordo broke free and scattered . Far above , in the upper reaches of the forest canopy , Whittlesey could see golden tints of sunlight . Animals -- probably spider monkeys -- thrashed and hooted above his head and a macaw swooped low , squawking obscenely . Whittlesey stopped next to a fallen jacaranda tree and watched Carlos , his sweating camp assistant , catch up . " We will stop here , " he said in Spanish . " Baja la caja . Put down the box . " Whittlesey sat down on the fallen tree and pulled off his right boot and sock . Lighting a cigarette , he applied its tip to the forest of ticks on his shin and ankle . Carlos unshouldered an old army packboard , on which a wooden crate was awkwardly lashed . " Open it , please , " said Whittlesey . Carlos removed the ropes , unsnapped a series of small brass clasps , and pulled off the top . The contents were packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled aside the fibers , exposing some artifacts , a small wooden plant press , and a stained leather journal . He hesitated a moment , then drew a small but exquisitely carved figurine of a beast from the shirt pocket of his field jacket . He hefted the artifact in his hand , admiring again its workmanship , its unnatural heaviness . Then he placed it reluctantly in the crate , covered everything with thefibers , and reattached the lid . From his rucksack , Whittlesey took out a folded sheet of blank paper , which he opened on his knee . He brought a battered gold pen out of his shirt pocket and began writing : Upper Xing Sept. 17 , 1987 Montague , I 've decided to send Carlos back with the last crate and go on alone in search of Crocker . Carlos is trustworthy , and I ca n't risk losing the crate should anything happen to me . Take note of the shaman 's rattle and other ritual objects . They seem unique . But the figurine I 've enclosed , which we found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been looking for . Note the exaggerated claws , the reptilian attributes , the hints at bipedalia . The Kothoga exist , and the Mbwun legend is not mere fabrication . All my field notes are in this notebook . It also contains a complete account of the breakup of the expedition , which you will of course know about by the time this reaches you . Whittlesey shook his head , remembering the scene that had played itself out the day before . That idiotic bastard , Maxwell . All he 'd cared about was getting those specimens he 'd stumbled on back to the Museum undamaged . Whittlesey laughed silently to himself . Ancient eggs . As if they were anything more than worthless seed pods . Maxwell should have been a paleobiologist instead of a physical anthropologist . How ironic they 'd packed up and left a mere thousand yards from his own discovery . In any case , Maxwell was gone now , and the others with him . Only Carlos and Crocker , and two guides , had stayed . Now mere was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Use my notebook and the artifacts , as you see fit , to help restore my good standing with the Museum . But above all else , take care of this figurine . I am convinced that its worth to anthropology is incalculable . We discovered it yesterday by accident . It seems to be the centerpiece of the Mbwun cult . However , there is no other trace of habitation nearby . This strikes me as odd . * * * Whittlesey paused . He had n't described the discovery of the figurine in his field notes . Even now , his mind resisted the memory . Crocker had wandered off the trail for a better look at a jacamar ; otherwise they 'd never have found the hidden path , slanting down steeply between moss-slick walls . Then , that crude hut , half-buried among ancient trees , in the wet vale where daylight barely penetrated ... The two Botocudo guides , normally chattering nonstop to each other in Tupian , shut up immediately . When questioned by Carlos , one of them just muttered something about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who violated its secrets . Then , for the first time , Whittlesey had heard them speak the word Kothoga . Kothoga . The shadow people . Whittlesey was skeptical . He 'd heard talk of curses before -- usually , right before a request for higher wages . But when he emerged from the hut , the guides were gone . ... Then that old woman , blundering out of the forest . She was probably Yanomamo , obviously not Kothoga . But she knew of them . She had seen them . The curses she 'd hinted at ... And the way she 'd just melted back into the forest , more like a jaguar yearling than a septuagenarian . Then , they turned their attention to the hut . The hut ... Gingerly , Whittlesey allowed himself to remember . It was flanked by two stone tablets with identical carvings of a beast sitting on its haunches . Its claw held something weathered and indistinguishable . Behind the hut lay an overgrown garden , a bizarre oasis of bright color amid the green fastness . The floor of the hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck on the way in . Whittlesey followed him more carefully , while Carlos simply knelt in the entranceway . The air inside was dark and cool and smelt of decaying earth . Switching on his flashlight , Whittlesey saw the figurine sitting on a tall earthen mound in the middle of the hut . Around its base lay a number of strangely carved discs . Then the flashlight reached the walls . The hut had been lined with human skulls . Examining a few of the closest , Whittlesey noticed deep scratch marks he could not immediately understand . Ragged holes yawned through the tops . In many cases , the occipital bone at the base of the skull was also smashed and broken off , the heavy squamosal bones completely gone . His hand shook , and the flashlight failed . Before he switched it on again , he saw dim light filtering through thousands of eye sockets , dust motes swimming sluggishly in the heavy air . Afterward , Crocker decided he needed a short walk -- to be alone for a while , he 'd told Whittlesey . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetation here is very unusual . The cycads and ferns look almost primordial . Too bad there is n't time for more careful study . We 've used a particularly resilient variety as packing material for the crates ; feel free to let Jorgensen take a look , if he 's interested . I fully expect to be with you at the Explorer 's Club a month from now , celebrating our success with a brace of dry martinis and a good Macanudo . Until then , I know I can entrust this material and my reputation to you . Your colleague , Whittlesey * * * He inserted the letter beneath the lid of the crate . " Carlos , " he said , " I want you to take this crate back to Prto de Ms , and wait for me there . If I 'm not back in two weeks , talk to Colonel Soto . Tell him to ship it back with the rest of the crates by air to the Museum , as agreed . He will draw your wages . " Carlos looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You will stay here alone ? " Whittlesey smiled , lit a second cigarette , and resumed killing ticks . " Someone has to bring the crate out . You should be able to catch up with Maxwell before the river . I want a couple of days to search for Crocker . " Carlos slapped his knee . " Es loco ! I ca n't leave you alone . Si te dejo atrs , te moriras . You will die here in the forest , Seor , and your bones will be left to the howler monkeys . We must go back together , that is best . " Whittlesey shook his head impatiently . " Give me the Mercurochrome and the quinine , and the dried beef from your pack , " he said , pulling the filthy sock back on and lacing his boot . Carlos started unpacking , still protesting . Whittlesey ignored him , absently scratching insect bites on the back of his neck and staring up toward Cerro Gordo . " They will wonder , Seor . They will think I left you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlos said rapidly , placing the items in Whittlesey 's pack . " The cabouri flies will eat you alive , " he continued , moving over to the crate and lashing it shut . " You will catch malaria again , and die this time . I will stay with you . " Whittlesey stared at the shock of snow-white hair plastered to Carlos 's sweaty forehead . That hair had been pure black yesterday , before Carlos looked into the hut . Carlos met his gaze for a moment , then lowered his eyes . Whittlesey stood up . " Adis , " he said , and disappeared into the bush . * * * By late afternoon , Whittlesey noticed that the thick , low clouds had returned to shroud Cerro Gordo . For the last I several miles , he had been following an ancient trail of unknown origin , barely a narrow alley in the brush . The trail cleverly worked its way through the blackwater swamps surrounding the base of the tepui , the soggy , jungle-clotted plateau that lay ahead . The trail had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It moved with obvious purpose ; animal tracks often wandered . And it was heading for a steep ravine in the shoulder of the approaching tepui . Crocker must have come this way . He stopped to consider , unconsciously fingering the talisman -- a gold arrow overlaid by another of silver -- that had hung around his neck since childhood . Besides the hut , they 'd seen no sign of human habitation for the last several days except a long-deserted root-gatherer village . Only the Kothoga could have created this path . As he approached the plateau , he could see a few braids of water cascading down its steep flanks . He would camp at the bottom tonight , and make the thousand-meter ascent in the morning . It would be steep , muddy , and possibly dangerous . If he met the Kothoga -- well , he would be trapped . But he had no reason to think the Kothoga tribe was savage . After all , it was this other creature , Mbwun , to which local myth cycles ascribed all the killing and savagery . Strange -- an unknown creature , supposedly controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist ? he wondered . Conceivably , a small remnant could be alive in this vast rain forest ; the area was virtually unexplored by biologists . Not for the first time , he wished that Crocker had n't taken his own Mannlicher .30 06 when he 'd left camp . But first , Whittlesey realized , he had to locate Crocker . Then he could search for the Kothoga , prove they had n't died out centuries before . He 'd be famous -- the discoverer of an ancient people , living in a kind of Stone Age purity deep in the Amazon , on a plateau that floated above the jungle like Arthur Conan Doyle 's The Lost World . There was no reason to fear the Kothoga . Except that hut ... Suddenly , a sharp sickly smell assailed his nostrils , and he stopped . There was no mistaking it -- a dead animal , and a big one . He took a dozen steps as the smell intensified . His heart quickened with anticipation : perhaps the Kothoga had butchered an animal nearby . There might be artifacts left at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . He crept forward . The sweet nauseating reek grew stronger . He could see sunlight in a patch of canopy high above his head -- the sure sign of a nearby clearing . He stopped and tightened his pack , not wanting to be hampered in case he had to move fast . The narrow trail , walled in by brush , leveled off and took a sudden turn into the head of the small clearing . There , on the opposite side , was the carcass of the animal . The base of the tree it lay against had been ritually carved with a spiral , and a bundle of bright green parrot feathers lay on top of the gaping , greasy brown rib cage . But as he walked closer , he saw that the carcass was wearing a khaki shirt . A cloud of fat flies roared and swarmed about the open rib cage . Whittlesey noticed that a severed left arm was lashed to the tree trunk with a fibrous rope , the palm sliced open . A number of spent cartridge casings lay around the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up under the corpse 's armpit , the back of the skull torn away , the cloudy eyes staring upward , the cheeks bulging . Whittlesey had found Crocker . Instinctively , Whittlesey began stumbling backward . He saw how rows of claws had flayed the body with obscene , inhuman strength . The corpse looked stiff . Perhaps -- if God was merciful -- the Kothoga had already departed . Assuming it was the Kothoga . Then he noticed that the rain forest , normally overflowing with the sounds of life , was silent . With a start , he turned to face the jungle . Something was moving in the towering brush at the edge of the clearing , and two slitted eyes the color of liquid fire took shape between the leaves . With a sob and a curse , he drew his sleeve across his face and looked again . The eyes had vanished . There was no time to lose -- he had to get back down the trail , away from this place . His path back into the forest lay directly ahead . He 'd have to make a run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground he had n't noticed before , and he heard movement , ponderous yet horrifyingly stealthy , through the brush in front of him .
