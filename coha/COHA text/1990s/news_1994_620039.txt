<p> Quick : What do Van Morrison , Kiss and the Carpenters have in common ? <p> All three will be among the subjects of more than 15 tribute albums to be released by the end of the year . Also coming are tributes to Led Zeppelin , Arthur Alexander , Richard Thompson , Neil Young , George Gershwin , Black Sabbath , Lynyrd Skynyrd , Leonard Cohen  --  each with an impressive all-star lineup . <p> In a trend that has grown slowly over the past several years , an onslaught of artists is interpreting the songs of the honorees . Some are as obvious as Eric Clapton 's playing Jimi Hendrix ; some as bizarre as Garth Brooks ' singing Kiss . <p> The results have been as mixed as the pedestrian renditions of Eagles hits , every one inferior to the original , by contemporary country stars on " Common Thread , " to the rather glorious reworkings of songs of the little-known Victoria Williams by Soul Asylum , Pearl Jam , Lou Reed and others , on " Sweet Relief . " That album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no insurance . <p> A STELLAR LIST <p> Cohen will be serenaded by a stellar list of mainstream veterans  --  Elton John , Willie Nelson , Billy Joel , Aaron Neville , Don Henley , Tori Amos , Trisha Yearwood . And the Carpenters have been covered , largely without irony , by an assortment of alternative types : Sonic Youth , American Music Club , Redd Kross , Babes in Toyland , 4 Non Blondes , Cracker and others . <p> Morrison co-produced his own forthcoming tribute album , " No Prima Donna , " featuring contributions from Elvis Costello , Sinead O'Connor , Marianne Faithful , Lisa Stansfield and Morrison 's daughter , Shana . Actor Liam Neeson delivers a spoken-word rendition on one track . <p> Oddly enough , outside of the 2 million-selling " Common Thread , " none of the released tribute albums has sold enormous amounts . <p> The concept is not new . Producer Hal Willner cut his first multi-artist tribute to Italian film composer Nina Rota in 1981 , and Yoko Ono was the subject of a 1984 tribute , " Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Costello , Eddie Money , Roberta Flack , Rosanne Cash and others . Producer Jon Tiven recorded a tribute to Phil Spector , " Bionic Gold , " with an array of little- known New York musicians in 1977 . But the tribute album is clearly an idea that has reached critical mass . <p> " It 's weird , is n't it , " mused Willner , who also serves as musical director of " Saturday Night Live . " " It 's kind of put me off doing any for a while . " <p> A PLETHORA SCHEDULED <p> In addition to the plethora scheduled before the close of the year , 1995 tribute albums are said to be in the works for George Harrison , John Lennon , Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac , and Motown founder and songwriter Berry Gordy Jr . It seems that no end is in sight . <p> " A couple come along and it really fuels the fire for more with producers , labels and fans , " said Pete Howard , an industry analyst and publisher of the Santa Monica-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed off each other . " <p> In the past few years , there have been tribute albums to artists as well known as Elton John , the Grateful Dead , Curtis Mayfield and Hendrix , and artists as little known as Williams , Roky Erickson , Harry Chapin and Gram Parsons . Bob Dylan was the subject of an all-star tribute concert at Madison Square Garden that turned into a live album and a home video . The favorite subject for tributes appears to be songs from Walt Disney movies ; three such albums are on the market now . <p> As is so often the case , this current industry infatuation can be traced to the small independent labels . A bunch of indie-type artists  --  Soul Asylum , Nick Cave , Sonic Youth , Dinosaur Jr .  --  collaborated on a 1989 Neil Young tribute , " The Bridge , " that garnered a lot of attention and may even have set the stage for Young 's current incarnation as Godfather of Grunge . England 's Imaginary Records blossomed forth with a series of tribute records , matching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hendrix , Syd Barrett , Captain Beefheart , the Kinks and the Byrds . Even the songs of Sonny Bono were celebrated on an indie tribute album . <p> SALES ENCOURAGING <p> But with the 1991 album " Two Rooms , " a collection of Elton John songs performed by a staggering list of heavies including Clapton , the Who , the Beach Boys , Tina Turner , Rod Stewart and others , the major labels entered the fray . " Two Rooms " may have celebrated nothing more than Polygram 's acquisition of the John song-publishing rights , but sales were encouraging . <p> " Deadicated , " the 1991 tribute to the Grateful Dead on Arista Records , came about when a fanatical admirer of the band , producer Ralph Sall , set out to prove a point about the band 's often-maligned songwriting . He fitted Los Lobos , Dwight Yoakum , Suzanne Vega , Costello , Midnight Oil and more to Dead songs . <p> " It was strictly me being a record producer and a Grateful Dead fan who felt their songs were n't getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eagles and upcoming Led Zeppelin tributes . " There is a certain prevailing opinion that there 's a glut of these records , but I do n't agree . If you pick the right subject and do it correctly , it will be successful . A subject might be worthy but not timely . There has to be a reason beyond ' Let 's do it . ' There 's got to be a concept behind it . " Sall currently is working on the Lennon tribute for release next year . <p> By the time Warner Bros. issued the Mayfield tribute earlier this year  --  with contributions from Bruce Springsteen , Clapton , Aretha Franklin , Stevie Wonder , Whitney Houston and others , at a reported budget of more than $ 1 million  --  the idea was entrenched on a major-label level as well . <p> INDEPENDENT LABELS CONTRIBUTE <p> Independent labels continue to compile tribute records . " The Infinite Summer of Love , " honoring the San Francisco sound of the ' 60s , was produced and licensed to a German label by San Francisco 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honoring Tom Petty , the Doors , Buddy Rich and the Hollies in the near future . <p> Many of these projects have earned money for charities . Producer Tiven has created a series of tributes to ailing rhythm and blues pioneers that have helped defray medical expenses for songwriters Otis Blackwell , Don Covay and Mayfield . An Arthur Alexander tribute provided needed funds to his heirs . " They 've all accomplished what I 've tried to do  --  bring these people to greater attention , " Tiven said . <p> Blackwell , writer of such rock classics as " All Shook Up , " " Handy Man , " " Fever " and others , was able to communicate his immense pleasure with the tribute despite being incapacitated by a stroke . Tiven 's Mayfield tribute , which preceded the million-dollar major-label effort , actually earned a radio hit for Huey Lewis and the News , who contributed an a cappella version of " It 's All Right . " <p> For Tiven , one of the main purposes of the tribute record is to throw some light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose work is , generally speaking , underappreciated and is n't an active figure on the scene , then you 're doing legitimate work . " <p> Willner echoed those sentiments : " I 've always dealt with complete bodies of work , not people that are still active and , as a general subject matter , not that well-known , " he said . <p> CREATIVE AND HIGH-MINDED <p> In many ways , Willner 's work has been the most creative and high-minded in the field , madly breaking stylistic barriers , merrily mixing artists and repertoire and choosing such relatively artistically elite subjects as Thelonious Monk , Charlie Mingus or Kurt Weill . His 1992 record , " Meditations on Mingus , " for instance , features appearances by such disparate musicians as Costello , Vernon Reid of Living Colour , Henry Rollins , Keith Richards , Leonard Cohen and author Hubert Selby Jr. , all backed by a rhythm section drawn from the ranks of downtown Manhattan avant-garde jazz circles . <p> " The Mingus record was n't a jazz record , although it was a record based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While both Tiven and Willner strive for consistency in the core bands for their records , the big-budget , major-label projects tend to farm out each track to a different producer , who assembles a band for the individual song being recorded . Warner Bros. executive Bill Bentley served as executive producer on the 1990 tribute to Texas psychedelic rock musician Roky Erickson of the 13th Floor Elevators that featured tracks by ZZ Top , R.E.M. , Butthole Surfers and others . <p> AN OVERUSED CONCEPT <p> " I have n't given up on them , " Bentley said of such projects . " Every once in a while you get one that makes sense . But I would n't do another one . I think it 's an overused concept .
