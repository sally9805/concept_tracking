Sir Peter Terry was doing a crossword puzzle in a back room in his house in the Staffordshire village of Milford when a gunman opened fire through a rear window , wounding him nine times . The attack left Terry with extensive internal injuries  --  as well as two bullets lodged less than an inch from his brain . <P> The following day , with Terry in stable condition , the Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for the attack . Its grievance was no mystery . Terry had been governor of Gibraltar in 1988 when three I.R.A . guerrillas were shot and killed there in an ambush that was staged by British agents . The I.R.A . members had been spotted parking a car that was mistakenly thought to contain a bomb . London claims that the I.R.A . rebels , who were unarmed , were shot when the agents believed their own lives were at risk .
