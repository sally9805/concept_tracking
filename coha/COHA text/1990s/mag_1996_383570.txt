A President Clinton is greeted by CBC Chair Donald Payne at the conference 's closing dinner . // The Congressional Black Caucus Foundation 's ( CBCF ) Annual Legislative Conference is far more than just a celebration-because it has the potential to change the course of American politics . That was the message members of the Congressional Black Caucus ( CBC ) worked unceasingly to drive home to the 20,000 people who recently converged on the nation 's capital to attend the conference , which has become the ultimate summit in Black politics . And changing the current course of American politics is exactly what CBC Chairman Congressman Donald Payne stressed must occur . During his State of Black America address at the start of the five-day national forum , Payne touched on every topic from the upcoming presidential and congressional elections to affirmative action to congressional redistricting to the recent Black church burnings in the South . " The theme chosen for this year 's conference-Yesterday , Today , and Tomorrow-is especially appropriate as this century draws to a close , " said Payne . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must continually look forward . " Looking toward the future was the reason why more than 65 issue forums , workshops and congressional braintrusts were convened by CBC members during the conference . The topics discussed included AIDS , banking , drug abuse , education , international trade , and allegations that the CIA was involved in conspiring to put drugs in Black communities .

" I refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it was a popular thing at the moment . I think the popularity has sort of faded now . Because the few instances of things that did n't work did n't prove that we should throw away something that had plainly worked overwhelmingly for so many people over the last 25 years . " Clinton also implored the 4,200 guests to help him to build the right kind of bridge to the 21st century . " There is no nation in the world so well-positioned for the 21st century as the United States , in no small measure because of you ... If we can maintain our commitment to staying on the cutting edge of change , and making sure everybody gets a chance to go there , no one will do as well as American children will in the 21st century .

Clinton bestowed the nation 's highest civilian honor on Parks and 10 others at the White House several days earlier ; however , he related Parks was unable to attend that ceremony . " One of the honorees , John Johnson ( founder , chairman and CEO of Johnson Publishing Company ) , is clearly a legend in the African-American community ... I enjoyed seeing him there , and I was glad to honor him .
