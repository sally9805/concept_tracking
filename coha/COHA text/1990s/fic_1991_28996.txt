1 THE SENIOR PARTNER studied the rsum for the hundredth time and again found nothing he disliked about Mitchell Y. McDeere , at least not on paper . He had the brains , the ambition , the good looks . And he was hungry ; with his background , he had to be . He was married , and that was mandatory . The firm had never hired an unmarried lawyer , and it frowned heavily on divorce , as well as womanizing and drinking . Drug testing was in the contract . He had a degree in accounting , passed the CPA exam the first time he took it and wanted to be a tax lawyer , which of course was a requirement with a tax firm . He was white , and the firm had never hired a black . They managed this by being secretive and clubbish and never soliciting job applications . Other firms solicited , and hired blacks . This firm recruited , and remained lily white . Plus , the firm was in Memphis , of all places , and the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a male , and there were no women in the firm . That mistake had b een made in the mid-seventies when they recruited the number one grad from Harvard , who happened to be a she and a wizard at taxation . She lasted four turbulent years and was killed in a car wreck . He looked good , on paper . He was their top choice . In fact , for this year there were no other prospects . The list was very short . It was McDeere or no one . The managing partner , Royce McKnight , studied a dossier labeled " Mitchell Y. McDeere -- Harvard . " An inch thick with small print and a few photographs , it had been prepared by some ex-CIA agents in a private intelligence outfit in Bethesda . They were clients of the firm and each year did the investigatingfor no fee . It was easy work , they said , checking out unsuspecting law students . They learned , for instance , that he preferred to leave the Northeast , that he was holding three job offers , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest offer was $76,000 and the lowest was $68,000 . He was in demand . He had been given the opportunity to cheat on a securities exam during his second year . He declined , and made the highest grade in the class . Two months ago he had been offered cocaine at a law school party . He said no and left when everyone began snorting . He drank an occasional beer , but drinking was expensive and he had no money . He owed close to $23,000 in student loans . He was hungry . Royce McKnight flipped through the dossier and smiled . McDeere was their man . Lamar Quin was thirty-two and not yet a partner . He had been brought along to look young and act young and project a youthful image for Bendini , Lambert &; Locke , which in fact was a young firm , since most of the partners retired in their late forties or early fifties with money to burn . He would make partner in this firm . With a six-figure income guaranteed for the rest of his life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably from his tall , athletic frame . He strolled nonchalantly across the thousand-dollar-a-day suite and poured another cup of decaf . He checked his watch . He glanced at the two partners sitting at the small conference table near the windows . Precisely at two-thirty someone knocked on the door . Lamar looked at the partners , who slid the rsum and dossier into an open briefcase . All three reached for their jackets . Lamar buttoned his top button and opened the door . " Mitchell McDeere ? " he asked with a huge smile and a hand thrust forward . " Yes . " They shook hands violently . " Nice to meet you , Mitchell . I 'm Lamar Quin . " " My pleasure . Please call me Mitch . " He stepped inside and quickly surveyed the spacious room . " Sure , Mitch . " Lamar grabbed his shoulder and led him across the suite , where the partners introduced themselves . They were exceedingly warm and cordial . They offered him coffee , then water . They sat around a shiny mahogany conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed his legs . He was now a seasoned veteran in the search of employment , and he knew they wanted him . He relaxed . With three job offers from three of the most prestigious firms in the country , he did not need this interview , this firm . He could afford to be a little overconfident now . He was there out of curiosity . And he longed for warmer weather . Oliver Lambert , the senior partner , leaned forward on his elbows and took control of the preliminary chitchat . He was glib and engaging with a mellow , almost professional baritone . At sixty-one , he was the grandfather of the firm and spent most of his time administering and balancing the enormous egos of some of the richest lawyers in the country . He was the counselor , the one the younger associates went to with their troubles . Mr. Lambert also handled the recruiting , and it was his mission to sign Mitchell Y. McDeere . " Are you tired of interviewing ? " asked Oliver Lambert . " Not really . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all agreed . Seemed like yesterday they were interviewing and submitting rsums and scared to death they would n't find a job and three years of sweat and torture would be down the drain . They knew what he was going through , all right . " May I ask a question ? " Mitch asked . " Certainly . " " Sure . " " Anything . " " Why are we interviewing in this hotel room ? The other firms interview on campus through the placement office . " " Good question . " They all nodded and looked at each other and agreed it was a good question . " Perhaps I can answer that , Mitch , " said Royce McKnight , the managing partner . " You must understand our firm . We are different , and we take pride in that . We have forty-one lawyers , so we are small compared with other firms . We do n't hire too many people ; about one every other year . We offer the highest salary and fringes in the country , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected you . The letter you received last month was sent after we screened over two thousand third-year law students at the best schools . Only one letter was sent . We do n't advertise openings and we do n't solicit applications . We keep a low profile , and we do things differently . That 's our explanation . " " Fair enough . What kind of firm is it ? " " Tax . Some securities , real estate and banking , but eighty percent is tax work . That 's why we wanted to meet you , Mitch . You have an incredibly strong tax background . " " Why 'd you go to Western Kentucky ? " asked Oliver Lambert . " Simple . They offered me a full scholarship to play football . Had it not been for that , college would 've been impossible . " " Tell us about your family . " " Why is that important ? " " It 's very important to us , Mitch , " Royce McKnight said warmly . They all say that , thought McDeere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mines when I was seven years old . My mother remarried and lives in Florida . I had two brothers . Rusty was killed in Vietnam . I have a brother named Ray McDeere . " " Where is he ? " " I 'm afraid that 's none of your business . " He stared at Royce McKnight and exposed a mammoth chip on his shoulder . The dossier said little about Ray . " I 'm sorry , " the managing partner said softly . " Mitch , our firm is in Memphis , " Lamar said . " Does that bother you ? " " Not at all . I 'm not fond of cold weather . " " Have you ever been to Memphis ? " " No . " " We 'll have you down soon . You 'll love it . " Mitch smiled and nodded and played along . Were these guys serious ? How could he consider such a small firm in such a small town when Wall Street was waiting ? " How are you ranked in your class ? " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five percent , but top five . That was enough of an answer for all of them . Top five out of three hundred . He could have said number three , a fraction away from number two , and within striking distance of number one . But he did n't . They came from inferior schools -- Chicago , Columbia and Vanderbilt , as he recalled from a cursory examination of Martindale-Hubbell 's Legal Directory . He knew they would not dwell on academics . " Why did you select Harvard ? " " Actually , Harvard selected me . I applied at several schools and was accepted everywhere . Harvard offered more financial assistance . I thought it was the best school . Still do . " " You 've done quite well here , Mitch , " Mr. Lambert said , admiring the rsum . The dossier was in the briefcase , under the table . " Thank you . I 've worked hard . " " You made extremely high grades in your tax and securities courses . " " That 's where my interest lies . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite impressive . " " Thank you . I enjoy research . " They nodded and acknowledged this obvious lie . It was part of the ritual . No law student or lawyer in his right mind enjoyed research , yet , without fail , every prospective associate professed a deep love for the library . " Tell us about your wife , " Royce McKnight said , almost meekly . They braced for another reprimand . But it was a standard , nonsacred area explored by every firm . " Her name is Abby . She has a degree in elementary education from Western Kentucky . We graduated one week and got married the next . For the past three years she 's taught at a private kindergarten near Boston College . " " And is the marriage --  " " We 're very happy . We 've known each other since high school . " " What position did you play ? " asked Lamar , in the direction of less sensitive matters . " Quarterback . I was heavily recruited until I messed up a knee in my last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I played off and on for four years , even started some as a junior , but the knee would never hold up . " " How 'd you make straight A 's and play football ? " " I put the books first . " " I do n't imagine Western Kentucky is much of an academic school , " Lamar blurted with a stupid grin , and immediately wished he could take it back . Lambert and McKnight frowned and acknowledged the mistake . " Sort of like Kansas State , " Mitch replied . They froze , all of them froze , and for a few seconds stared incredulously at each other . This guy McDeere knew Lamar Quin went to Kansas State . He had never met Lamar Quin and had no idea who would appear on behalf of the firm and conduct the interview . Yet , he knew . He had gone to Martindale-Hubbell 's and checked them out . He had read the biographical sketches of all of the forty-one lawyers in the firm , and in a split second he had recalled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to Kansas State . Damn , they were impressed . " I guess that came out wrong , " Lamar apologized . " No problem . " Mitch smiled warmly . It was forgotten . Oliver Lambert cleared his throat and decided to get personal again . " Mitch , our firm frowns on drinking and chasing women . We 're not a bunch of Holy Rollers , but we put business ahead of everything . We keep low profiles and we work very hard . And we make plenty of money . " " I can live with all that . " " We reserve the right to test any member of the firm for drug use . " " I do n't use drugs . " " Good . What 's your religious affiliation ? " " Methodist . " " Good . You 'll find a wide variety in our firm . Catholics , Baptists , Episcopalians . It 's really none of our business , but we like to know . We want stable families . Happy lawyers are productive lawyers . That 's why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd heard this before . The three looked at each other , then at Mitch . This meant they had reached the point in the interview where the interviewee was supposed to ask one or two intelligent questions . Mitch recrossed his legs . Money , that was the big question , particularly how it compared to his other offers . If it is n't enough , thought Mitch , then it was nice to meet you fellas . If the pay is attractive , then we can discuss families and marriages and football and churches . But , he knew , like all the other firms they had to shadowbox around the issue until things got awkward and it was apparent they had discussed everything in the world but money . So , hit them with a soft question first . " What type of work will I do initially ? " They nodded and approved of the question . Lambert and McKnight looked at Lamar . This answer was his . " We have something similar to a two-year apprenticeship , although we do n't call it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax seminars . Your education is far from over . You 'll spend two weeks next winter in Washington at the American Tax Institute . We take great pride in our technical expertise , and the training is continual , for all of us . If you want to pursue a master 's in taxation , we 'll pay for it . As far as practicing law , it wo n't be very exciting for the first two years . You 'll do a lot of research and generally boring stuff . But you 'll be paid handsomely . " " How much ? " Lamar looked at Royce McKnight , who eyed Mitch and said , " We 'll discuss the compensation and other benefits when you come to Memphis . " " I want a ballpark figure or I may not come to Memphis . " He smiled , arrogant but cordial . He spoke like a man with three job offers . The partners smiled at each other , and Mr. Lambert spoke first . " Okay . A base salary of eighty thousand the first year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A low-interest mortgage so you can buy a home . Two country club memberships . And a new BMW . You pick the color , of course . " They focused on his lips , and waited for the wrinkles to form on his cheeks and the teeth to break through . He tried to conceal a smile , but it was impossible . He chuckled . " That 's incredible , " he mumbled . Eighty thousand in Memphis equaled a hundred and twenty thousand in New York . Did the man say BMW ! His Mazda hatchback had a million miles on it and for the moment had to be jump-started while he saved for a rebuilt starter . " Plus a few more fringes we 'll be glad to discuss in Memphis . " Suddenly he had a strong desire to visit Memphis . Was n't it by the river ? The smile vanished and he regained his composure . He looked sternly , importantly at Oliver Lambert and said , as if he 'd forgotten about the money and the home and the BMW , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last year we earned more per lawyer than any firm our size or larger . That includes every big firm in the country . We take only rich clients -- corporations , banks and wealthy people who pay our healthy fees and never complain . We 've developed a specialty in international taxation , and it 's both exciting and very profitable . We deal only with people who can pay . " " How long does it take to make partner ? " " On the average , ten years , and it 's a hard ten years . It 's not unusual for our partners to earn half a million a year , and most retire before they 're fifty . You 've got to pay your dues , put in eighty-hour weeks , but it 's worth it when you make partner . " Lamar leaned forward . " You do n't have to be a partner to earn six figures . I 've been with the firm seven years , and went over a hundred thousand four years ago . " Mitch thought about this for a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be well over a hundred thousand , maybe close to two hundred thousand . At the age of thirty ! They watched him carefully and knew exactly what he was calculating . " What 's an international tax firm doing in Memphis ? " he asked . That brought smiles . Mr. Lambert removed his reading glasses and twirled them . " Now that 's a good question . Mr. Bendini founded the firm in 1944 . He had been a tax lawyer in Philadelphia and had picked up some wealthy clients in the South . He got a wild hair and landed in Memphis . For twenty-five years he hired nothing but tax lawyers , and the firm prospered nicely down there . None of us are from Memphis , but we have grown to love it . It 's a very pleasant old Southern town . By the way , Mr. Bendini died in 1970 . " " How many partners in the firm ? " " Twenty , active . We try to keep a ratio of one partner for each associate . That 's high for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things differently . " " All of our partners are multimillionaires by the age of forty-five , " Royce McKnight said . " All of them ? " " Yes , sir . We do n't guarantee it , but if you join our firm , put in ten hard years , make partner and put in ten more years , and you 're not a millionaire at the age of forty-five , you 'll be the first in twenty years . " " That 's an impressive statistic . " " It 's an impressive firm , Mitch , " Oliver Lambert said , " and we 're very proud of it . We 're a close-knit fraternity . We 're small and we take care of each other . We do n't have the cutthroat competition the big firms are famous for . We 're very careful whom we hire , and our goal is for each new associate to become a partner as soon as possible . Toward that end we invest an enormous amount of time and money in ourselves , especially our new people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer leaves our firm . It is simply unheard of . We go the extra mile to keep careers on track . We want our people happy . We think it is the most profitable way to operate . " " I have another impressive statistic , " Mr. McKnight added . " Last year , for firms our size or larger , the average turnover rate among associates was twenty-eight percent . At Bendini , Lambert &; Locke , it was zero . Year before , zero . It 's been a long time since a lawyer left our firm . " They watched him carefully to make sure all of this sank in . Each term and each condition of the employment was important , but the permanence , the finality of his acceptance overshadowed all other items on the checklist . They explained as best they could , for now . Further explanation would come later . Of course , they knew much more than they could talk about . For instance , his mother lived in a cheap trailer park in Panama City Beach , remarried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They knew she had received $41,000 from the mine explosion , squandered most of it , then went crazy after her oldest son was killed in Vietnam . They knew he had been neglected , raised in poverty by his brother Ray ( whom they could not find ) and some sympathetic relatives . The poverty hurt , and they assumed , correctly , it had bred the intense desire to succeed . He had worked thirty hours a week at an all-night convenience store while playing football and making perfect grades . They knew he seldom slept . They knew he was hungry . He was their man . " Would you like to come visit us ? " asked Oliver Lambert . " When ? " asked Mitch , dreaming of a black 318i with a sunroof . The ancient Mazda hatchback with three hubcaps and a badly cracked windshield hung in the gutter with its front wheels sideways , aiming at the curb , preventing a roll down the hill . Abby grabbed the door handle on the inside , yanked twice and opened the door . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel . The Mazda began a slow roll . As it gained speed , she held her breath , released the clutch and bit her lip until the unmuffled rotary engine began whining . With three job offers on the table , a new car was four months away . She could last . For three years they had endured poverty in a two-room student apartment on a campus covered with Porsches and little Mercedes convertibles . For the most part they had ignored the snubs from the classmates and coworkers in this bastion of East Coast snobbery . They were hillbillies from Kentucky , with few friends . But they had endured and succeeded quite nicely all to themselves . She preferred Chicago to New York , even for a lower salary , largely because it was farther from Boston and closer to Kentucky . But Mitch remained noncommittal , characteristically weighing it all carefully and keeping most of it to himself . She had not been invited to visit New York and Chicago with her husband . And she was tired of guessing . She wanted an answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked two blocks . Their unit was one of thirty in a two-story red-brick rectangle . Abby stood outside her door and fumbled through the purse looking for keys . Suddenly , the door jerked open . He grabbed her , yanked her inside the tiny apartment , threw her on the sofa and attacked her neck with his lips . She yelled and giggled as arms and legs thrashed about . They kissed , one of those long , wet , ten-minute embraces with groping and fondling and moaning , the kind they had enjoyed as teenagers when kissing was fun and mysterious and the ultimate . " My goodness , " she said when they finished . " What 's the occasion ? " " Do you smell anything ? " Mitch asked . She looked away and sniffed . " Well , yes . What is it ? " " Chicken chow mein and egg foo yung . From Wong Boys . " " Okay , what 's the occasion ? " " Plus an expensive bottle of Chablis . It 's even got a cork . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Follow me . " On the small , painted kitchen table , among the legal pads and casebooks , sat a large bottle of wine and a sack of Chinese food . They shoved the law school paraphernalia aside and spread the food . Mitch opened the wine and filled two plastic wineglasses . " I had a great interview today , " he said . " Who ? " " Remember that firm in Memphis I received a letter from last month ? " " Yes . You were n't too impressed . " " That 's the one . I 'm very impressed . It 's all tax work and the money looks good . " " How good ? " He ceremoniously dipped chow mein from the container onto both plates , then ripped open the tiny packages of soy sauce . She waited for an answer . He opened another container and began dividing the egg foo yung . He sipped his wine and smacked his lips . " How much ? " she repeated . " More than Chicago . More than Wall Street . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyed him suspiciously . Her brown eyes narrowed and glowed . The eyebrows lowered and the forehead wrinkled . She waited . " How much ? " " Eighty thousand , first year , plus bonuses . Eighty-five , second year , plus bonuses . " He said this nonchalantly while studying the celery bits in the chow mein . " Eighty thousand , " she repeated . " Eighty thousand , babe . Eighty thousand bucks in Memphis , Tennessee , is about the same as a hundred and twenty thousand bucks in New York . " " Who wants New York ? " she asked . " Plus a low-interest mortgage loan . " That word -- mortgage -- had not been uttered in the apartment in a long time . In fact , she could not , at the moment , recall the last discussion about a home or anything related to one . For months now it had been accepted that they would rent some place until some distant , unimaginable point in the future when they achieved affluence and would then qualify for a large mortgage . She sat her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't hear that . " " A low-interest mortgage loan . The firm loans enough money to buy a house . It 's very important to these guys that their associates look prosperous , so they give us the money at a much lower rate . " " You mean as in a home , with grass around it and shrubs ? " " Yep . Not some overpriced apartment in Manhattan , but a three-bedroom house in the suburbs with a driveway and a two-car garage where we can park the BMW . " The reaction was delayed by a second or two , but she finally said , " BMW ? Whose BMW ? " " Ours , babe . Our BMW . The firm leases a new one and gives us the keys . It 's sort of like a signing bonus for a first-round draft pick . It 's worth another five thousand a year . We pick the color , of course . I think black would be nice . What do you think ? " " No more clunkers . No more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she slowly shook her head . He crunched on a mouthful of noodles and smiled at her . She was dreaming , he could tell , probably of furniture , and wallpaper , and perhaps a pool before too long . And babies , little dark-eyed children with light brown hair . " And there are some other benefits to be discussed later . " " I do n't understand , Mitch . Why are they so generous ? " " I asked that question . They 're very selective , and they take a lot of pride in paying top dollar . They go for the best and do n't mind shelling out the bucks . Their turnover rate is zero . Plus , I think it costs more to entice the top people to Memphis . " " It would be closer to home , " she said without looking at him . " I do n't have a home . It would be closer to your parents , and that worries me . " She deflected this , as she did most of his comments about her family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He nodded , bit into an egg roll and imagined her parents ' first visit , that sweet moment when they pulled into the driveway in their well-used Cadillac and stared in shock at the new French colonial with two new cars in the garage . They would burn with envy and wonder how the poor kid with no family and no status could afford all this at twenty-five and fresh out of law school . They would force painful smiles and comment on how nice everything was , and before long Mr. Sutherland would break down and ask how much the house cost and Mitch would tell him to mind his own business , and it would drive the old man crazy . They 'd leave after a short visit and return to Kentucky , where all their friends would hear how great the daughter and the son-in-law were doing down in Memphis . Abby would be sorry they could n't get along but would n't say much . From the start they had treated him like a leper . He was so unworthy they had boycotted the small wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . " Once when I was a little girl . Some kind of convention for the church . All I remember is the river . " " They want us to visit . " " Us ! You mean I 'm invited ? " " Yes . They insist on you coming . " " When ? " " Couple of weeks . They 'll fly us down Thursday afternoon for the weekend . " " I like this firm already . "
