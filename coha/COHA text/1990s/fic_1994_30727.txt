Chapter One&lt; Ian Yarbro was in no mood for a party . Dingoes had brought down four of his best sheep just since Monday . Water holes all over the property were coming up dry . And worst of all , Jacy Tiernan , damn her , was back from America . The first two plights were sorry ones , all right , but a man had to expect a fair portion of grief if he undertook to raise sheep in South Australia . That last bit , though , that was something personal , an individualized curse from God . With a resounding sigh Ian leaned back against the south wall of the shearing shed , a mug of beer in one sore , lacerated hand , and scowled . Every muscle in his body throbbed , for he 'd shorn more squirming woollies than any man on his crew in the days just past , and he felt as though he could sleep for a month , should the opportunity arise . That was n't going to happen , of course , not with all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sip from his beer , which had lost its appeal while he pondered his troubles , and surveyed the rustic festivities . The music of the fiddles and mouth harps seemed to loop and swirl like invisible ribbon in the warm summer twilight . Shearers and roustabouts alike clomped round and round the long wooden floor of the shed , some dancing with women , some with each other . The night air was weighted with heat , since it was January , speckled with dust and bits of wool fiber and rife with the smells of sweat and brewer 's yeast , cheap cologne and cigarette smoke . And Jacy was back . Ian muttered a curse . It had been bad enough , this past day or so , knowing Jacy was living right next door at Corroboree Springs , but at least she 'd had the good grace to keep her distance . Until about five minutes before , that is , when she 'd walked into the celebration with her father . Ian could have ignored her completely , and would have , if it had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best mates Ian had ever had , and he was just out of hospital as it was . Collie Kilbride had flown the pair of them , Jake and his daughter , up from Adelaide in his vintage plane the day before yesterday . If he was going to live with himself , Ian reasoned sourly , he 'd have to go over to Jake and shake his hand and tell him it was good to see him up and about again . No need for so much as a glance in Jacy 's direction , as far as he could see , but if an acknowledgment was required , he 'd just nod at her in the most civil fashion he could manage . Frowning , he pushed away from the wall , tossed what remained of his beer through the open doorway of the shed , and handed the mug off to Alice Wigget as he passed her . Wending his way between the spinning couples was like moving through the gears of some enormous machine . The colored light from the paper lanterns dangling from the rafters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders and curled riotously around her face . She 'd put on a bit of weight since he 'd seen her last , as well . Too bad , Ian thought uncharitably , that it had all settled nicely into just the right places . Drawing nearer still , Ian saw that Jacy 's blue-green eyes were luminous with affection as she gazed up at her father 's face . She was good at looking as if she gave a damn , but where had she been for all those years , while Jake 's luck was getting worse and worse by the day ? Where had she been when her dad 's health had started failing ? Ian was seething by the time he reached them . He felt a muscle twitch in his cheek , set his jaw in an effort to control the response , then thrust out his hand to Jake . " It 's about time you got back and started tending your property , instead of leaving the whole place for your mates to look after , " he said , half barking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't force a smile to his mouth . Jake , always good-natured and full of the devil , had no such problem . He beamed as he pumped Ian 's hand , but his grasp was not the knuckle-crusher it had once been , and he was thin to the point of emaciation . There were deep shadows under Jake 's pale blue eyes , and his face had a skeletal look about it . " Well , then , " Tiernan teased , " let 's see what you 've made of the job before you go complaining too loudly , Ian Yarbro . I 've just been back for these two days , and for all I know , you 've ' helped ' me straight into the poorhouse . " Ian was painfully conscious of Jacy 's nearness ; he felt her gaze on him , caught the muted , musky scent of her perfume . And , God help him , he remembered too damned much about how things had been between them , once upon a time . " Hello , Ian , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoky , evoking all kinds of sensory reactions . She was going to force him to acknowledge her . He should have known it would n't be enough for her , just coming there and stirring up all those old memories again . He forced himself to look down into her upturned face and instantly regretted the decision . Jacy was twenty-eight now , as he was , and far more beautiful than she 'd been at eighteen . He saw a flicker of some tentative , hopeful emotion in her eyes . " Hello , " he replied , and the word came out sounding gravelly and rusted , as though he had n't used it in a long time . Jake and the shearers and the roustabouts and their women seemed to fade into a pounding void , and there was only Jacy . Ian hated knowing she could still affect him that way , and he hated her , too , for ripping open all the old wounds inside him . The dancers pounded and thumped around them , shaking the weathered floorboards , and Ian had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helpless , into the depths of Jacy Tiernan 's eyes . He did n't notice that the music had stopped until it started again , louder than before , and strangely shrill . Jake put one hand on Jacy 's back and one on Ian 's , then pushed them toward each other with a gentle but effective thrust . I think I 'll sit this one out , he shouted , to be heard over the din , and then he stumped away through the crowd . By no wish of his own Ian found himself holding his first love in his arms . He swallowed hard , battling a schoolboy urge to bolt , and began to shuffle awkwardly back and forth , staring over the top of her head . Jacy moved with him , and they were both out of step with the music . Nothing new in that . " Is it really so terrible , " she asked , in the familiar Yankee accent that had haunted his memories for a decade , " dancing with me ? " " Do n't , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plea . Ian felt exasperation move through Jacy 's body like a current , though he was barely touching her . " Will you just lighten up ? " she hissed , standing on tiptoe to speak into his ear . " You 're not the only one who 's uncomfortable , you know ! " Ian 's emotions were complex , and he could n't begin to sort them out . That nettled him , for he was a logical man , and he hated chaos , especially within himself . He wanted to shake Jacy Tiernan for all she 'd put him through , but he also wanted to make love to her . He was furious that she 'd come back , but at one and the same time he felt like scrambling onto the roof and shouting out the news of her return . He clasped her forearm  --  it was bare and smooth , since she was wearing a sleeveless cotton sundress  --  and half dragged her to the door and down the wooden ramp to the ground . The farmyard was filled with cars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow some distance away . " What are you doing here ? " he demanded in an outraged whisper . Jacy raised her chin and put her hands on her hips . Her pale yellow dress seemed to shimmer in the rich light of the moon and stars , and her eyes sparked with silver fire . " That depends on what you mean by ' here , ' " she retorted just as furiously . " If you mean why am I here at this damn party , then the answer is , because my father wanted to come and see all his friends and neighbors , and I came along to make sure he did n't overdo and land himself back in the hospital . If , on the other hand , you meant why am I in Australia , well , that should be obvious . My dad had a heart attack , and I 'm here to look after him . " Ian was fairly choking on the tangle of things he felt ; he might have turned and put a fist through the rickety wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cut from all the times he 'd caught his own flesh in the clippers while shearing sheep . " Ten years you stayed away , " he said instead . " Ten years . Do you think he did n't need you in all that time ? " Do you think I did n't need you ? he thought . Her eyes brimmed with tears , and because Ian was n't expecting that , he was wounded by the sight . " Damn it , Ian , " she said , " there 's no need to make this so difficult ! I 'm here , and I plan to stay for an indefinite period of time . If you ca n't accept the fact , fine , just stay out of my way , and I 'll stay out of yours . When we have the misfortune to run into each other , let 's try to be civil , shall we ? For Jake 's sake , if nothing else . " Ian could n't speak . He was reeling from her announcement that she would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him crazier than her absence , and that was having her live at Corroboree Springs day in and day out . Naturally , she could n't leave well enough alone and keep her mouth shut . Oh , no . That would never have done . " Well ? " she prompted with a sort of nasty sweetness . Ian shoved a hand through his dark hair . With all the business of mustering and shearing the sheep , then dipping them in disinfectant to prevent infection in the inevitable scrapes and cuts and to keep the blowflies away , he 'd let it grow too long , and it felt shaggy between his fingers . " You should have stayed in America , " he said stubbornly . " Jake has mates here . We 'd have been glad to look after him , with no help from you . " She dried her eyes with the heel of one palm , smearing the stuff she wore on her lashes , and then tossed her head . " God , Ian , you can be such a bastard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Would it have killed you to say good-bye before you left ? " he snapped , regretting the words even as they tumbled from his mouth . " Even ' go to hell ' or ' drop dead ' would have been better than just leaving the way you did . " " So now it was all my fault ! " she flared , making less of an effort to keep her voice down that time . " Has it escaped you that Elaine Bennett came up to us in front of the movie house in Yolanda and announced that she was carrying your baby ? " She threw out her hands for emphasis . " But maybe you did forget . After all , you certainly never got around to mentioning that you 'd been sleeping with her while we were going together ! " Ian tilted his head back and glared up at the stars . He did n't know why he bothered to tell her , since she 'd never believe him , but the truth was all he had to offer . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie would have been convenient , but he 'd never gotten the knack of it . When he tried , he stuttered and his neck turned a dull red , so he 'd long since given it up . " Elaine and I were all through before I ever touched you , Jacy . " He made himself meet her eyes and saw there the incredulity he 'd feared all along . " And somewhere deep inside yourself , you know it . You knew it then . You just needed something to throw between us , some excuse to run away , because you were scared to death of what you were feeling ! " Jacy retreated a step and hugged herself as if a chill had struck her , even though it was nearly ten-thirty and stiff hot enough to smother a came . " Okay , so I was scared , " she murmured testily , but with less conviction than before . " I was only eighteen . " " So was I , " Ian responded brusquely , giving no ground whatsoever . " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt for you was real , and so was the hell I went through when you walked out on me . " It was all he could trust himself to say . He turned to walk away toward the long , one-story cement homestead he shared with his nine-year-old son , Chris , intending to wait out the party there . Chances were , no one would miss him . She clasped his arm , and Ian stopped cold , bracing himself , refusing to turn and face her . " I 'm sorry , Ian , " she said . " Please believe that . " He wrenched free . It was n't good enough , after the way he 'd suffered . " Do us both a favor , " he said , still refusing to look at her . " Go back to America and stay there . " With that he strode off toward the dark and empty house , where the light and music of the party would n't reach , and it was he walking into his own soul . Jacy stood watching as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flinching when she heard a door slam in the distance . She had n't expected their first meeting in ten years to be easy  --  not after the way things had ended for them  --  but she had n't anticipated anything so wrenching and difficult as this , either . She needed time to compose herself , not wanting her dad and the friends , neighbors , and workers jammed into Ian 's shearing shed to see how shaken she was , so she sat down on a crate in the shadows , drew a deep breath , and folded her arms . Some of the things Ian had said stuck in her spirit the way briars and nettles stuck in the sheeps ' wool and the callused fingers of the shearers  --  especially that bit about her being afraid of the love she 'd felt for him . It had been as vast and deep as an ocean , that youthful adulation , full of treacherous beauty and alive with mysterious currents . She 'd thought , sometimes , that the great waves would encompass her one day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer moon , mentally tracing its gray ridges and valleys of cold light . Another of Ian 's accusations had struck its mark , too ; she 'd neglected her dad , keeping her distance those ten long years when she 'd known how much her visits meant to him . It had been hard staying away , because she and lake had always been kindred souls , but she simply had n't been ready to face Ian . She still was n't , she supposed , though she had n't had much choice in the matter . " Jacy-me-girl ? " Startled by her father 's voice , gentle as it was , Jacy jumped a little and turned her head quickly . Jake was standing at the base of the ramp , leaning on the cane he 'd been using since he left the hospital . His heart attack had left him weakened and gaunt , and Jacy still had n't gotten used to the change in him . He 'd been so strong as a younger man , as vital and tireless as Ian , though always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? " he asked in the fitting accent she loved . Jacy blushed , knowing Jake had had hopes of his own for the evening . He had been a second father to Ian , since the elder Yarbros had passed on within a few years of each other , when Ian was still very young . Jake had never made secret of his belief that Jacy and Ian belonged together . " It could n't have been worse , " she said with a sigh and a rueful , shaky smile . " Except if he 'd drawn a gun and shot me , that is . " Jake made his way to the crate with a slow awkwardness that was painful to see , then took a seat beside his daughter " Give him time , " he counseled . " Ian 's a hardheaded sort , you know . " " I had n't noticed , " Jacy mocked , but she moved a little closer to her dad and lot her head rest against his thin shoulder . Jake patted her hand . " Once he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jacy stiffened . " I do n't want him to come around , Dad . Not in the way you mean at least . " The glow of the moon only highlighted the amused skepticism in Jake 's face . " Is that so ? Then I 'll confess to wondering why a simple shearing shed would be filled to the rafters with blue lightning from the moment the two of you spotted one another . There was so much electricity flying about in there that I 'd have been afraid to step in a puddle of spilled beer . " Jacy Could n't help smiling at his description of the tension that had coiled between her and Ian earlier in the evening . She slipped her arm around Jake and said , " I 've missed you a whole lot . " Do n't be changing the subject , " he replied , his accent thicker than ever . It happened whenever he was being mischievous or having trouble controlling his emotions . This is a small community , and you and Ian wo n't be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . " She linked her fingers with her dad 's and squeezed . Jake had a point ; Ian 's property bordered their own , and if that was n't enough , they were bound to meet in nearby Yolanda , in the post office and the shops . Or in Willoughby , the slightly larger town fifty kilometers to the northeast , where homesteaders and townspeople alike went to see the doctor , purchase supplies , and attend to various other errands that could n't be taken care of in Yolanda . " Are you sure you would n't like to come back to the States with me , just until you 're feeling strong again ? " she ventured , though she knew as she spoke what the answer would be . Jake had nothing against America  --  he 'd married a Yank , after all  --  but he 'd often said he was no more suited to the place than a kangaroo was to Manhattan . He simply arched an eyebrow . " All right , " Jacy burst out . " Then we 'll go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve . We could collect seashells and lie out in the sun and eat those wonderful giant avocados . " She still had some of the colorful shells she 'd gathered back then , displayed on a shelf in her room at the homestead . To her the shells symbolized eternity and the extravagant , careless continuity of life . " We could leave tomorrow . What do you say ? " " I say that you 're trying to run away again . " Jake paused , still gripping her hand , to study the spectacular display of stars , their majesty undimmed by the lights of any city . When he looked at her again , the expression in his eyes was sad and gentle . " You 've done enough of that in your young life , Jacy . It 's time to stop now , and face matters head on . " She averted his eyes , afraid of all that was in her heart , good and bad , noble and ignoble , terrified that all those mixed-up emotions would spill over and disgrace her if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . There was no point in denying her father 's words anyway , because he was right  --  Jacy 's unspoken credo had always been She who loves and runs away , lives to love another day . Only she had never loved again . Not before Ian , and certainly not after . " What do I do now ? " she asked in a soft voice . " Nothing much , " Jake replied easily , tenderly . " Just stand still for a time , Jacy-me-girl . That 's all . Just hold your ground and see what comes toward you . " She laughed , but the sound resembled a sob . " What if it 's a freight train ? " Jake chuckled , slipped an arm around her shoulders , and gave her a brief hug . " See that you do n't stand on the railroad tracks , love . Now let 's take ourselves home , shall we ? I 'm tuckered . " Jacy was relieved to be leaving Ian 's place . At the same time she was worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are n't you ? " she asked , peering at him anxiously . " We could drive over to Willoughby and see the doctor , just to be on the safe side  --  " " And rouse the poor bloke from his bed ? " Jake spoke amicably , as he almost always did , but Jacy knew the suggestion had annoyed him because be shook off her hand when she tried to help him stand . " Get a grip on yourself , sheila . I ca n't go waltzing off to the doctor every time I feel a bit worn down , now can I ? " Wisely , Jacy said nothing . She just walked along at Jake 's side , and when they reached his dusty old truck she got behind the wheel and left him to hoist himself into the vehicle on his own . Jacy rose early the next morning , even before Jake was up . It was her third day back , but she was still greedy for the sights and sounds and smells of the place . She loved the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old-fashioned roses Grandmother Matty had planted at one end of the veranda . Loved the shed , although there were no horses there now , and the paddocks , though there were no sheep . As little time as she had spent there , the homestead and the land surrounding it were dear to her in a way her mother and stepfather 's luxurious townhouse in Manhattan had never been . She lingered on the veranda for a while , watching the sunlight sparkle and dance on the surface of the spring-fed pond a little distance away , in the midst of a copse of thirsty trees . From there the water flowed away through the paddock in a wide stream , eventually forming the border between the Tiernan land and Merimbula , the huge cattle station to the south . Standing still , she heard her mother 's voice in her mind . " You are an Aussie through and through , " Regina had often said , always adding a long sigh for effect . " It 's in your blood , that hot , lonely , harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer you my sincerest apologies . " Jacy smiled . She 'd spent most of her life in America , but there was an element of truth in her mother 's words . She was an Aussie , in so many ways . Some of her pleasure faded . Despite her Australian heritage , Ian and not a few other people would always view her as an outsider . It would be nave to believe her former lover was the only one who thought she 'd failed Jake by staying away all those years ; in the bush , where everyday life was a challenge , abandoning someone was just about the worst thing a person could do . A betrayal of one was a betrayal of all , and the homesteaders around Yolanda had long , long memories where such matters were concerned . She turned reluctantly and went back into the cool shelter of the house . Jake was still sleeping , apparently , so she returned to her own room and pulled Grandmother Matty 's handmade quilt off the bed . The coverlet had n't been washed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . In the homestead 's primitive kitchen Jacy heated water on the gas-powered stove , making as little noise as possible then she rinsed out the quilt in the kitchen sink , wrung it gently , and carried it out to the clothesline in back of the house . When it was drying in the warm morning sun she brewed a cup of tea and sat on the back step to drink it , watching with delight as a mob of kangaroos sprang across the paddock separating her father 's property from Ian 's . She was exhausted , and not just from the hasty trip across the international date line , after she 'd learned about Jake 's heart attack , and the long vigil at the hospital in Adelaide that had followed . There were troubles waiting back in the States , snarls to untangle , things that , true to form , she 'd run away from . The way she 'd run away from Ian . " Ian . " She spoke the name softly , but aloud , and it hurt more than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushfire ; tears stung her eyes , a sob escaped her , and finally she knew it was futile to try to hold back her grief any longer . She wept in earnest . When the personal storm was over Jacy sniffled , tilted her head back , and closed her puffy eyes . Scenes from that awful time ten years before played on the screen of her mind in Technicolor and stereo . She made herself walk through the memories , facing them one by one . Having done that , she reasoned , she might be able to look Ian in the eye the next time they met without losing her dignity . Jacy saw in her thoughts a smaller and wilder version of her sophisticated twenty-eight-year-old self , a sunburned waif in blue jeans . Her dark blond hair had been short then , and she 'd ridden all over the property , and some parts of those adjoining it , on her aging white mare , Biscuit . She 'd been free as a gypsy in those days , knowing nothing of heartache . Even her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been too young to remember leaving the homestead with her mother , and she 'd made the long trip Down Under often throughout her childhood to stay with Jake . Ian , like Jacy , had been just eighteen the year the world turned upside down , but more man than boy even then . He 'd already begun taking over the responsibilities of running the property he 'd inherited from his father . Jacy had fallen in love with Ian at a spring party much like the one the night before , after the shearing had been done and the wool baled and sent off to Adelaide in semis to be sold . Miracle of miracles , he had felt the same way about her , or said he did , at least , and in secret places on her father 's property and his own he had taught her to glory in her womanhood . He had introduced her to the most excruciatingly sweet pleasures , and , in fact , no man had touched her so intimately since . They 'd planned to marry , over Jacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strong and smart , but she 'd entered into a rash marriage in a foreign land herself once , and subsequently her bridegroom , Australia , and her own disillusionment had combined forces to break her heart . Not surprisingly , Regina had been terrified that the same fate awaited her daughter . In the end , though , it had been Elaine Bennett , daughter of the American manager of Merimbula Station , who had brought Jacy 's dreams down with a soul-shattering crash . She 'd come up to Jacy and Ian outside the theater in Yolanda , looked Ian straight in the eye , and told him she was going to have his baby . Even after a decade Jacy could still feel the terrible shock of that moment and the helpless , fiery rage that had followed . Ian had not denied the accusation ; neither had he troubled himself to explain or apologize . He 'd simply expected Jacy to understand . A distant bleating sound jolted Jacy from her musings , and she rose slowly from her seat on the step . Way off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicking up the dry red dust as they came . Jacy 's heart rose immediately to her throat and lodged there , impassable . The sheep were Ian 's  --  she had no doubt of that  --  on their way to the springs to drink . For a few moments she nursed her scant hope that someone else would be driving the flock , or mob , as the locals called it  --  one of Ian 's two or three hired men , maybe . Even before Ian himself came into view , however , mounted on that enormous liver-colored stallion Jake had written her about , she knew she could n't be so lucky . She was n't ready , she thought frantically . Not so soon . The baaing and bleating of the sheep grew until the racket filled Jacy 's skull and stomach , and she watched the mob divide like water coursing around a stone . Two lean dogs kept the odd-looking beasts moving when they would have stopped to nibble the grass in the yard , and great clouds of red dust billowed in the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grit . Jacy just stood there on the back step like a felon on the scaffold , waiting for the noose to tighten around her neck . Her clothes  --  jeans and a white T-shirt  --  felt all wrong , her hair probably looked like hell , and she had n't bothered to put on makeup . She 'd never felt less prepared for anything . She figured she 'd be really upset about the quilt once her thoughts calmed down , but at the moment she was too distracted . In the dazzling light of a summer day it was plain that Ian 's features had hardened with maturity . His violet gaze seemed to slice through her spirit , cutting cleanly , leaving no jagged edges . Her knees went weak , and she sagged onto the step . Jet lag , she insisted to herself , though it had been more than three weeks since she 'd landed in Adelaide . Ian was wearing perfectly ordinary clothes  --  a battered stockman 's hat ; a blue cambric workshirt , the front of which was stained with sweat ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stole Jacy 's breath away . " How 's Jake this morning ? " he asked , shouting to be heard over the last of the sheep and swinging down from the saddle . There was nothing cordial in the question ; she could see by his expression that things had n't changed since the night before . " See for yourself , " she replied , amazed that the words had gotten past her constricted throat . Her heart was pounding like a ceremonial drumbeat , and she feared she might be sick to her stomach . Ian tethered the horse to a rusted hitching post , resettled his hat , and crossed the yard to stand facing her . " See for myself I will , " he answered in that low , rumbling voice that had once urged her to passion and then consoled her afterward , when she 'd feared that all the scattered pieces of her soul would never find their way back to her . " If you 'll just get out of my way . " Jacy looked straight into those impossibly blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and turned her back on Ian , praying he would n't guess how shaken she was . " Dad was sleeping before your sheep came tramping through here like a herd of buffalo , " she said in a moderately acidic tone . She could feel him behind her , though of course they were n't touching , feel the heat and hardness of him in the small of her back , the space between her shoulder blades and her nape , the tender flesh of her thighs and the insides of her knees . " I do n't suppose you noticed what those creatures did to my clean quilt . " They entered the kitchen . " I do n't suppose I did , " Ian said , utterly without remorse . " I 'll tell Jake you 're here . " " Thanks for that much , anyway , " Ian grumbled . In an involuntary backward glance Jacy saw him hang his hat on a peg beside the door and shove splayed fingers through his hair . Suddenly the old anger crashed through all her carefully constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jacy 's self-control to keep her voice calm and even . " What did you expect , Ian ? That I 'd welcome you with open arms ? That I 'd thank you for teaching me that love has fangs ? " Ian 's jawline hardened , but before he could speak , Jake appeared in the inside doorway , leaning on his cane . " Hello , mate , " he said . " I wondered when you 'd get round to paying an old man a visit . " Ian 's laugh was a low burst of sound , only too well remembered by Jacy and somehow excluding her . " You think I 've got nothing better to do than eat biscuits and sip tea with the likes of you , Jake Tiernan ? " Jacy hurried outside before her father could suggest that she put the kettle on . She 'd eat a bale of raw wool before she 'd make tea and fetch cookies for Ian Yarbro . If he wanted refreshments , he could damn well serve himself .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
