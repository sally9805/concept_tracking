<p> Nicholas Wilson 's painstaking techniques for adding vital details to his gouache paintings have earned him international acclaim among wildlife-art enthusiasts . <p> A viewer at an exhibition of Nicholas Wilson 's gouaches desert animals asked him how he had " pasted hair on the paintings . " He replied , " Not pasted on  --  scratched in . " However , the viewer 's question is n't surprising when one sees the illusion of three-dimensional animal hair , fur , and feathers that Wilson achieves in his works . His paintings are the result of a distinct , singular technique mastered only through years of experience  --  a technique requiring up to a dozen straight-edge razor blades per painting that has made Wilson a renowned wild-life artist . He exhibits widely and has been commissioned to design prestigious installations , such as the one he created in 1984 at Jungle World in the world-famous Bronx Zoo in New York City . <p> Perhaps it 's because he resides so close to the animals he portrays in the eighty-mile are between Phoenix and Payson , Arizona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson 's animal portraits have a quality of " touch-ability " that makes viewers want to " feel " the fur and feathers . In this desert region there are seven different life zones , each with its own flora and fauna , that change as the terrain ascends two thousand feet into the Superstition and Mazatzal Mountains . The flora ranges from saguaro cactus to spruce forest and the fauna includes quail , roadrunners , red-tailed hawks , turkey vultures , cayotes , raccoons , cottontail rabbits , bighorn sheep , mountain lions , bobcats , and kit and gray foxes , all of which are likely subjects for Wilson 's special treatment . <p> In preparation for his designing a series of murals depicting the world 's rain forests , New York City 's Zoological Society sent Wilson to the jungles of Trinidad , just off the coast of Venezuela , where he worked with a resident botanist and saw firsthand that marvelous and fragile environment whose plight is now the focus of worldwide concern . During the trip , Wilson collected butterflies as well as creating numerous sketches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work and cover 16,250 square feet of wall space in the Jungle World exhibit . The exhibit opened officially in 1985 . <p> Characteristically , Wilson then turned to the opposite extreme : continuing a series of small copper-plate etchings , which , he says , " provide some of the finest detail imaginable . " In addition , the artist continues to sculpt animals for his series of limited-edition bronzes , which find a broad market among collectors . However , Wilson 's use of gouache on Masonite panels , with which he creates the extremely textures of fur , hair , and feathers that have become his trademark , has brought him the widest attention . <p> Wilson started teaching himself to draw and paint when he was in grade school in Seattle , Washington , where he was born , and continued making art through high-school , which he attended in Reno , Nevada . Teachers in both cities gave him support and encouragement throughout his early years . <p> Following his graduation from high school , he worked both as a ski instructor and a framer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal portraits . A freelance assignment from the Nevada Department of Fish and Game to illustrate a manual on chukar partridges led to his first wide exposure . This in turn led to a job as staff artist at the Arizona Sonora Desert gin Tucson and , at the age of twenty-three , he became museum 's curator of exhibits . There , he first developed his unique painting method . <p> At this museum , regional animals are displayed in outdoor habitats that simulate their natural environment . " I learned a lot about animals while I was experimenting with art there , " Wilson comments . It was n't long before his carefully detailed portraits of animals began to find buyers and were reproduced on posters that were put on sale in the museum gift shop . At the time , he described his works as " semi-still lifes " : He took little interest in paintings of animals in action , preferring to show their passive behavior rather than their defensive and offensive territorial side . He later began showing the animals up close and in much greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques because , as Wilson points out , " I was getting into the sort of detail work that could n't be painted ; for the three-dimensional look I wanted , I needed to identify materials I could scratch into . " One experiment involved scratchboard paintings on chalk-coated cardboard . " Unfortunately the boards fell apart , " he remembers . He then developed a ground of made with diatomaceous which is used for swimming-fool filters ; this made " a dull , brittle surface , " Wilson remarks . <p> " I 'm not really a scratchboard painter , " says Wilson . " I , m doing gouache paintings , scratching out details in feather and hair . " At first , he tried using a scratchboard , knife , but he currently uses straight-edge razor blades to achieve his textures . A careful and methodical worker , Wilson describes his method in a similarly exact manner , beginning with his original concept for a painting : " In conceptualizing a painting , I always position the animal as the main focal point while attempting to marry it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a kind of large-scale prop , which supports the main theme . From my extensive photographic file , compiled from twenty years of visits to zoos , game farms , and observations in the wild , I decide on the specific animal for the painting . I often use two or more photos as reference for one composite subject . To begin , I quickly sketch several positions that suit the picture idea , usually focusing on the one that best conveys the animal 's strong points , such as dramatic field marks or stance . The photos are referred to for details of feature and musculature . Next , I redraw the subject more explicitly in my sketchbook and then go out to locate a setting . " <p> More often than not , the setting is in the vicinity of Wilson 's home , a locale of greatly varied trees , rocks , grasses , and wildflowers . " I like painting weathered rocks and wood because these textures contrast well with fur , " he comments . Since most of these settings are within walking distance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his photographic file for information . Instead , he says , " I compose from what 's available at the moment . I need to experience being there in person just before beginning a painting . There are times when I 'll drive up to fifty miles just to find the right locale . It can mean hours and hours of walking around . " <p> When he looks for a setting that promises to accommodate his subject 's size and position , he photographs the scene , focusing on specific details . " Then I take a series of four or five photos , which can later be overlapped to produce an overview of the entire setting , " he says . " Afternoon light is best for these pictures . " He uses a Konica Auto Reflex 35-mm. camera and has black-and-white prints processed locally within a few hours . Wilson will also sketch the setting while " experiencing the mood of it , " he points out . " I sketch it into the animal drawing I did back in the studio in order to work out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal subject will overlap what 's contained in my photographs . Then I shade in the tones and shadows , in an effort to further this imprinting process . " He may also make brief notes on the location sketch , citing details such as cracks , textures , or lighting effects worth remembering . " I usually spend about an hour soaking up the scene and making mental notes . Once I have all this information , I leave the setting and have the film developed , " says the artist . <p> Back at the studio , using a new sheet of paper , he creates a closely detailed brush-and-ink drawing in the exact size he has chosen for the final painting . He says , " I make anatomical corrections with dry-brush shading , and outline the whole animal in black to judge the profile . Then I get my light source to match the lighting in the setting photos . " He then does an additional graphite drawing in reduced size to place the animal in its setting for final corrections . " Symmetry is my main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not attempt a color sketch , " he reports . <p> He then turns to the final painting , for which he uses 1/4 " - thick untempered Masonite that has been coated with shellac to seal off the surface . The smooth side is coated with the artist 's special mixture of lacquer , designed to accept the gouache paint as well as to allow the hairs on the animal subject to be scratched out of the surface . This lacquer coat is made of a mix of fifty percent nitrocellulose white lacquer and fifty percent chalk flattener , bought at an automotive paint store . The automotive flattener contains diatomaceous earth as its main element . " I spray on twenty coats of the lacquer , " Wilson observes , " each of which dries quickly , until the final thickness is like thin paper . " Onto this ground , Wilson then traces with graphite the animal subject from his original ink drawing . He redraws the setting elements onto the board around the animal 's outline until the entire composition is in place , using soft vine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then underpaint the whole surface carefully in acrylics , using only burnt umber and ultramarine blue , " he says . " The underpainting allows me to play with various values in order to harmonize the elements within the painting . I try to bring out more and more detail as I work . Once this is dry , I can begin coloring in over the acrylic with gouache . Since I 'm working now over insoluble acrylic , there is no danger of lifting portions of the under-painting in the process . " <p> Using the razor blades , Wilson proceeds to " go around the different parts of the animal body , indicating with scratches the general hair direction and length . The razor blade exposes the white lacquer ground lying just beneath the field of brown acrylic . This produces a white line against a darker field . " Once he has determined the direction of the hair , Wilson says , " I cut the lines closer together by making scratch marks in a series of modified x 's in a technique I call tracking . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern of thin , white lines , which suggest the under-fur of the animal . This process takes many hours . After it has been completed , I glaze the panel with a soft wash of color in gouache , which tints all the scratched white lines a light brown . At this point I have a light brown hairline against the darker field . " <p> A new layer of scratched lines is then placed on the panel and once again , after the previous wash has been fixed with fixative spray , a glazing wash is laid over the top . Early layers may show through succeeding ones to some degree . These newer scratches are applied to create deliberate highlights and to isolate entire hair groups on the animal . " This may be repeated six to eight times over the subject , " says Wilson , " requiring up to a dozen razor blades in the process . <p> " Once the animal is completed , " he continues , " less than one percent of the original field color remains , having been replaced by repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit to the number of layers that can be worked over an area , provided none of them is too deeply scratched into the surface . " When Wilson gets close to finishing a work , he evaluates color and textures and edges and adjusts them to achieve harmony . " Some colors are enhanced ; others are subdued , " he says . " I place complementary colors near one another for interest and by this time I 'm using various types of brushes , including bristle and sable . Then I 'm ready for a coat of varnish . I stars with a couple of light coats of acrylic spray followed by one coat of matte final varnish . I find this protects the painting sufficiently and eliminates the need for glass . It brings out the colors to their full intensity and value . " <p> Wilson 's palette for gouaches and oils consists of Winsor &; Newton paints in both mediums in the following colors : Naples yellow , yellow ochre , cadmium yellow medium , lemon yellow , burnt sienna , burnt umber , cadmium red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , viridian green , sap green , cadmium orange , titanium white , cobalt violet , and Mars violet . The last color , Wilson notes , " is only for underpainting oils , because Norman Rockwell used it for that . I use no black at all , but mix ultramarine and burnt umber for my darkest darks . " <p> His exacting methods and precise results leave little room for spontaneous changes as he works . " I have to have all my ideas ahead of time and I visualize the finished work , even in its frame , before I even begin to draw , " Wilson remarks . Long hours of close work have resulted in a growing body of work in gouache on Masonite panels , none larger than 18 " x 24 " . " It would be impossible to do larger works in this technique , " says Wilson . " I 'd never finish . " Therefore , when he wants to do larger paintings , Wilson turns to oils . " I try to achieve the same effects with less time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a 62 " - x- 72 " painting , to be installed in a weekend cabin set amidst seven thousand forested acres near Flagstaff , Arizona . <p> " My oil paintings look like gouaches , " he says . " The hair texture is not as fine , but it is appropriate to the picture area . There are some effects that I do n't strive for in oil because I 'd just be repeating myself , and I do n't do small oils , either . " Wilson needs variety and change of pace , and the challenge of using different mediums acts as a stimulus as well as relaxation from doing only one or the other . His oils comprise about on , third of his output ; the gouaches account for half , and the rest is etching and bronze sculpture . His subject is always animals , which are always portrayed in compelling detail . Over the years , Wilson 's compositions have changed from the passive still-life poses characteristic of his early work to more active studies , in which animals interact with their environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " I do n't care to have too many commissions for large paintings or oils , and I do n't like the challenge imposed by working to sell . I need to be satisfied by doing the work . " He chuckles . " Lit the gallery do the selling . " Considering the breathtaking beauty of his paintings , it 's a job his galleries  --  which include Venture Fine Arts in Tucson and Trailside Galleries in Scottsdale , Arizona and Jackson Hole , Wyoming  --  find a pleasurable one . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Before a Storm , Mountain Lion , 1988 , gouache , 18 x 24 .
