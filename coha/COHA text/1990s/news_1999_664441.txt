<p> With 20 percent of its members implicated in the Salt Lake scandal , the International Olympic Committee promised Wednesday to consider expelling more of them to restore its damaged credibility and assuage big-money sponsors . <p> " We will act decisively , " said Anita DeFrantz , an IOC vice president from the United States . <p> IOC leaders read the 300-page report issued Tuesday by a Salt Lake ethics panel , a document detailing more than $ 1 million in cash payments and other favors lavished on IOC members during the city 's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games . <p> The report linked an additional 10 IOC members to the scandal , bringing to 24 - a fifth of the total membership - the number of Olympic delegates accused of accepting excessive benefits . <p> The IOC said the ethics report was being forwarded to its own six-man panel investigating the Salt Lake case . <p> The decision-making IOC executive board expects to receive " the earliest possible recommendations " from the panel , the IOC said in a statement from Lausanne , Switzerland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking action based on all available evidence , " the statement said . <p> Last month , the IOC panel identified 14 members involved in alleged excesses stemming from Salt Lake 's bid . <p> Nine of those members have either resigned or been expelled by the IOC executive board . Three others - including powerful executive board member Kim Un-yong of South Korea - remain under investigation , one received a warning and one has died . <p> The IOC noted that last month 's expulsions were " based on evidence available at the time . " <p> Further expulsions are now likely before the special IOC assembly in Lausanne , March 17-18 . <p> " If you find something that 's a real breach , we basically have only one sanction , and that 's expulsion , " said IOC vice president Dick Pound , head of the internal inquiry . <p> IOC executive board delegate Jacques Rogge , a member of Pound 's panel , said the commission will likely meet soon to review the report . <p> Rogge said he was not surprised that more members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up , " he said . <p> Rogge said a key issue for the IOC panel will be to determine whether members were guilty of actual ethical violations . <p> " You have to differentiate between what is a breach of the line , and what is so-called ' lavish treatment , " ' he said . <p> IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has also written to all cities which bid for the Olympics of 1996 through 2004 , asking for any documented evidence of misconduct . The deadline for responses is Feb. 15 , meaning even more members could be implicated before the March meeting . <p> IOC marketing director Michael Payne , on a trip to the United States to meet with Olympic sponsors , said the IOC is doing everything in its power to stamp out corruption and institute reform . <p> " Has the IOC been damaged ? " Payne said . " Yes , clearly it has . On the other hand , it 's the opportunity to clean house and to reform . You have to take two or three steps backwards to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of Olympics sponsor John Hancock insurance criticized the IOC 's handling of the crisis and suggested that Samaranch 's tenure may be running out . <p> But Payne rejected the continuing calls from outside the IOC for Samaranch to resign , saying the 78-year-old president is needed to lead the house-cleaning efforts . <p> " If the president stepped down , you would have a presidential election with all the instability that would bring , " Payne said . " That 's the last thing you want at this stage . You need a firm hand at the top to drive through the changes . " <p> Payne played down the decison by John Hancock , one of the IOC 's international corporate sponsors , to cancel negoatiations with NBC for $ 20 million in ads . <p> " They are n't withdrawing from their sponsorship , " he said . " This issue is related to a media purchase , which is separate from the sponsorship . Several Olympic sponsors do n't advertise at all on the broadcast . There 's no obligation . " <p> Despite John Hancock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support from the Olympic sponsors who pay tens of millions of dollars to help finance the games . <p> " The sponsors are standing , first of all , behind the games , and , second , behind the steps and action the IOC , Samaranch and the executive board are taking , " Payne said . <p> Payne spoke by telephone from New York , where he will meet this week with Olympic sponsors . He also is to travel to Australia later this month to meet with sponsors of the 2000 Sydney Games . <p> A key test for IOC leaders is how they handle the case of Kim , the South Korean executive board member and highest-ranking official implicated in the Salt Lake scandal . <p> Kim is one of three members - along with Russia 's Vitaly Smirnov and Ivory Coast 's Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye - still under investigation by Pound 's panel . <p> Kim was further implicated in the Salt Lake report . It found that the bid committee paid $ 45,000 toward the salary of his son , John , to work at Keystone Communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keystone 's former chief executive said the bid committee paid all of the costs of John Kim 's employment - $ 75,000 to $ 100,000 . <p> Kim claimed the report had exonerated him and his son . <p> " Any secret deal between the bid committee and Keystone was a contrivance solely between those two entities , and was wholly unknown to either Dr. Kim or to his son , " Kim 's lawyer , Howard Graff , said in a statement . <p> The ethics report also said Kim sought bid committee help in getting a visa and admission aid for a Russian student at the University of Utah . The committee spent $ 15,000 on the student , the report said . <p> Kim , 67 , has been considered a leading contender to succeed Samaranch , whose term expires in 2001 . <p> " Such persistent attempts to smear both my reputation and the leadership of president Samaranch are political and designed to undermine the stability of his leadership , as well as to affect the succession of his presidency , " Kim said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I have a lot of ammunition . " <p> Kim said he did not expect his opponents to try to expel him . <p> " That 's too risky for them , " he said . <p> In other developments : <p> - Australia 's Phil Coles , one of the 10 new IOC members implicated in the Salt Lake case , stepped down from the Sydney Olympic organizing committee board , pending an IOC inquiry . <p> The Salt Lake report said Coles and Guatemala 's Willi Kaltschmitt made four visits together , with their families , to the United States - including a trip to the Super Bowl in Miami , hosted by Salt Lake City bid director Tom Welch , at a cost of $ 19,991 . <p> " Phil categorically denies that he visited Salt Lake City four times during Salt Lake City 's candidature , " Coles ' lawyer , Simon Rofe , said . " It is regrettable that the board of ethics chose to make this serious allegation of unethical conduct without first putting it to Phil in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> - Barbados IOC member Austin Sealy , who was implicated in the Salt Lake report , denied any wrongdoing . Bid records showed $ 3,000 a month passed through a company affiliated with a consultant to Sealy . <p> " I have never been solicited for my vote , never been offered any payment , never been offered any inducement , " he said . " The bottom line is that I know nothing about any payments . I 'm completely in the dark about this . " <p> - The Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that Stockholm 's unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Olympics paid for the medical care of IOC members or their relatives on five occasions . The newspaper said each of the payments amounted to more than the $ 150 limit for gifts . <p> - The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Olympic chief Billy Payne suggested a college tennis scholarship , medical treatment and free plane tickets as gifts for IOC members in a memo written before the city won the 1996 Games , but immediately dismissed the idea . <p> - In Salt Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitt Romney to be chosen Thursday as the chief of a committee badly bruised by scandal . <p> The Boston venture capitalist , who is the choice of Gov . Mike Leavitt and Salt Lake Organizing Committee chairman Robert Garff , met Wednesday with SLOC board members who will be asked to hire him as the new chief executive officer of the group staging the 2002 Winter Games . <p> " He 's the sort of franchise player that can restore the integrity to an institution that has gone awry , " said Bill Hybl , president of the U.S. Olympic Committee . <p> - Leavitt , responding to allegations that the telecommunications company U S West dangled a $ 5 million Olympic contribution for favorable treatment , said Wednesday he is abandoning a sweeping initiative to deregulate the industry .
