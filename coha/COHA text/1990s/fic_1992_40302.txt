The Piper Cub was gathering speed . Its engine droned , at first like a fly buzzing in the ear and then like the whining of a dozen lawn mowers . The wheels bounced against the asphalt as it struggled to lift from the earth . Cleo clutched the seat belt tied snugly around her hips , then stole a look at Freda . Cleo did n't want Freda to notice the panic rising in her . But Freda was looking straight ahead as she pulled back on the throttle , hurtling the little plane smoothly into blue sky . <p> " How ya doin ' ? " Freda shouted , as she leveled off at 2,000 feet . <p> " Okay , " answered Cleo , although her heart was still beating wildly . It was the first time that she 'd been airborne in something so small . It was smaller than the Cessna she had ridden in at the Ocala Fair last summer . Cleo had been searching for the craft show when she let a nice white lady , a member of a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride in a four-seat Cessna . <p> At first she had been afraid as the small plane swayed lazily into the sky . But the brief ride around the fairgrounds changed her perspective on things . Cleo , who had been born and raised in the all-Black Memphis suburb of Ocala , had always thought of this Central Florida area as a dull-green plain . Everything she knew she had learned within its narrow borders . But gliding 1,000 feet above it , Cleo looked down on a land of vivid greens , criss-crossed by dusty-red dirt roads leading away from Highway 50 . The roads seemed to roll on indefinitely . When she landed in the plane , Cleo reluctantly crawled out . She wanted to see more , to follow the roads she had seen to their ends . She wanted to learn to fly . <p> " So you 've caught the disease , " the white lady , who 'd introduced herself as Freda Smith , said with a little laugh . " I 'm an instructor at Ocala Airport . I could teach ya . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleo . <p> " Wait , do n't walk away , " Freda had stopped Cleo as she started off to look for her three children . She had left them with her mother to wander among the animal stalls . " The Ninety-Nines has a scholarship program to help women learn to fly . Here , take this card and call me in a couple of days . " <p> Cleo had n't really expected to get free flying lessons . But then Freda had told her to come on , that the Ninety-Nines had approved a scholarship for her . <p> That was six months ago . She had spent hours on successive Saturdays learning how to navigate , to understand airplane instrumentation . Today she was observing . Tomorrow she would fly . <p> She had n't told a soul about her lessons . She was afraid someone might wake her from this pleasant dream . <p> When they landed two hours later , Freda offered to buy coffee at the airport restaurant . But Cleo did n't have time . " My husband 's supposed to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Cleo hurriedly taking her purse from the locker . <p> " Oh , I forgot it was Friday , " said Freda . " Have fun , hon. " <p> " Do n't worry , " said Cleo as she pushed through the airport 's glass double doors . <p> Thirty minutes later Cleo was in her kitchen , making dinner and talking with her children . After sitting the kids down to eat , Cleo went upstairs to get out of the jeans she had worn all day . She had just changed into a sundress when she heard her man coming home . His red Ford pickup growled as it ascended the small rise in the driveway . Cleo brushed her lips with red gloss and hurried out of the bedroom . <p> Downstairs in the living room , she stopped to peek out the window . Pulling up behind Ty was his father , Bill , driving his old Buick . Damn , thought Cleo . She had wanted to talk to Ty alone , to tell him about her recent good fortune . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children in the kitchen . Billy , 9 , Mike , 8 , and Sheila , 5 , whooped and ran blindly past her out the door . Cleo watched smiling as Ty tried to hug them all at once . She saw Ty looking over their heads toward the house , but she did n't move from the shadows of her front window . <p> The last time he had come home during a weekend break from his job at a power plant being built in Georgia , they had quarreled . " What happened to that sweet little girl I married ? " Ty had asked as he searched Cleo 's smooth dark-brown face for an answer . " You 're so stubborn now . " <p> She and the children had stood huddled outside the truck door in the driveway . The children , feeling the chill between her and Ty , clung to her in silence . In their grasps she could feel their desperation to see their parents laugh and break the tension that filled the space between them . But she discovered during that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's moods . She was developing unmalleable edges to her personality . <p> " Maybe you ought to take a harder look , " Cleo had answered . " I 'm not a little girl anymore . " But when he had left for the job five years ago , she had cried like a baby . She was afraid that she would n't be able to manage the household , even with weekend visits from Ty and with her parents two blocks away . She remembered his impatience as he tried to reason with her . <p> " You do n't have to worry ' bout nothing , " he had tried to assure her . " I 'll be home every Friday . This job is a chance for me to make some real money . " And when the tears would n't stop , he added testily , " Damn , girl , you 're no child . You can take care of yourself . " <p> Ten years ago , when they were married , Cleo had felt lucky to get Ty . She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on her daddy 's porch , asking to cut the grass . He was 18 then , long and loose-jointed , with muscles that rippled under his cinnamon-brown skin . She was a tall 13 , all legs and hormones . They had dated secretly at first , just after she turned 17 . She thought her parents would disapprove of her going out with a " man . " But Ty charmed them , as he did most people , and they let her go . <p> " The man of the house is home , " Ty bellowed now as he entered the door , interrupting Cleo 's thoughts . Their children and Bill , Ty 's father , followed noisily . <p> " Cleo ? " Cleo rushed to Ty then . She did love this man . She held him briefly in her arms and lifted her face to be kissed . He could still make her tingle with desire . . . <p> " Fly ? What you need to learn how to do that for ? " Ty snorted later , sitting up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We do n't have time for games , girl . I 'm set to start my contracting business . We 're going to need every extra dollar you can make on overtime until it takes off . Has n't that been our plan ? " <p> Cleo jumped out of bed to confront Ty , forgetting the shame that always made her hide the stretch marks on her belly . <p> " You mean your plan , " Cleo whispered angrily , remembering her sleeping children nearby . " When 'd you ever ask me what I wanted ? It wo n't cost nothing for me to get my pilot 's license . I got a scholarship . I 've been taking lessons for six months . " <p> " Six months ! " Ty shouted . " Why I 'm just hearing about it now ? " <p> " There was n't time before . You 're in and out of here so fast , I ca n't think of everything to tell you . " <p> " That 's bull . . . " said Ty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forget it , Cleo . We ca n't afford for you to waste time learning to fly . Think , we 've got money for an airplane ? " <p> " I 'm doing it , " Cleo hissed . <p> " You 've gotten so damn stubborn , I hardly know you , " Ty said in disgust . He sat back on his legs and looked Cleo over . " Look Cleo , this is not the time to branch out into something frivolous . Tell you what : You help me until the business takes off and then I 'll pay for you to finish flying school , how about that ? " Ty 's smile radiated charm . <p> Cleo resisted . " No , Ty , that wo n't do . All our married life I 've been doing what you wanted , to satisfy you . Once , just once , I 'd like to do something frivolous , something just for me . " <p> " I said no , Cleo , " Ty spat out , his jaw clenched . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatched her robe and started for the door . Ty sprang from the bed , grabbed her by the shoulders and spun her around . He pushed her off-balance and they both fell on the closed door , Ty leaning heavily against her . Ty had never hit her , but Cleo feared he might now , and she turned her face to the side . <p> " You 've got to choose , Cleo , " Ty whispered tensely in her ear , pausing between each word to gulp in air . " Do you want to be my wife or do you want to be some lady pilot ? Choose carefully now , or you 'll find yourself back in your daddy 's house . " <p> With that Ty pushed Cleo out of the way and stalked downstairs . Closet doors opened and closed . Soon she heard Ty 's truck roar to life , its tires squealing on the concrete driveway , then fading to a rumble in the distance . She should go after him , she thought , tell him that she wanted to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to make him understand that this is important to me , Cleo thought . But is it worth giving up your man ? her inner voice whispered . Cleo felt a tightening in her chest . She thought about calling her momma , or her friend Jeannetta . Instead she crawled into bed and waited , sure that sleep would n't come until Ty was home again . <p> " Momma , Momma , Daddy said come eat , " Sheila said , patting Cleo on the shoulder . Cleo felt heavy , her head still clouded from exhaustion as she turned over to face her daughter . She could hear laughter and the voice of her men below . " Momma , Daddy said come eat , " Sheila repeated , tugging at the arm that Cleo had moved from under the covers . <p> " Okay , I 'm getting up , " Cleo said , but she did n't rise . Instead she scooped her daughter into a hug , which made the little girl giggle . Ty had obviously washed and dressed Sheila , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocala factory where she worked . <p> " You can go eat now , your momma 's up , " said Cleo . <p> " No , you 're not , " said Sheila . <p> " Okay , here , " said Cleo and she threw a leg over the side of the bed . Sheila giggled again . <p> " That 's not up , " she said . <p> " Alright , I 'm getting up , " Cleo said , and she threw her other leg over the side and pulled her torso slowly up . She saw by the clock on the nightstand that it was just after 7:00 A.M. She was supposed to meet Freda at the airfield at 8:30 . " Okay , you 've got me up . You can go eat , " Cleo said . " I 'll be down in a minute . " Cleo appeared in the kitchen 30 minutes later , showered and ready to fly . Ty , Billy , Mike and Sheila were at the table , chattering happily between bites of pancakes and bacon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The children greeted her in near unison . <p> " Hi , " Ty said , searching her face for a clue to her feelings . Cleo got a mug of coffee and sat beside Ty . <p> " Guess what y'all , I 'm going to fly an airplane today , " said Cleo . <p> " You are , Momma ? Can we go ? " asked Billy . <p> " Can we , Momma ? " joined Mike . <p> " Not this time , I 'm just learning , but maybe later , " said Cleo . Ty 's eyes , so loving a moment ago while talking with the children , had narrowed . <p> " So you 've chosen , " Ty said as he got up from the table with his plate and walked to the sink to empty the leftovers into the garbage disposal . <p> The children were too excited to notice their father 's change of mood . " Wow , Momma 's going to be a pilot . I 'm going to be a pilot , too , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood next to Ty . " Please try to understand . This may seem a silly thing , but it 's something that I want to do . I feel ... so ... free up there , " said Cleo . <p> " Well , it looks like you want to be free down here too , " Ty said without turning to look at his wife . <p> " Oh , Ty , I 'm not saying that ... Come watch me . Maybe if you see , you 'll understand , " said Cleo . <p> " Who 's going to look after the children ? I had planned to go over to my daddy 's place , " said Ty . <p> " Then take them with you , " said Cleo , abruptly turning around . Then to her children : " See ya later . Your daddy 's taking you to see your Granny and Gramps . " She kissed the tops of their heads and turned to go . She could feel Ty 's stare boring into her back . <p> " Ca n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy . <p> " Ask your daddy , " Cleo said , then she went to get her car out of the garage . But sitting in the car she felt less sure about leaving . She started to go back inside and tell Ty she could wait . " No , I 'm going , " Cleo said aloud to herself . She started the car and eased it down the driveway . Suddenly she saw Billy running across the front lawn , waving his arm frantically . <p> " Stop ! Wait , Momma ! " he shouted as though she was down the street already . Cleo braked and rolled down the window . <p> " Daddy ... Daddy said where are you going to fly from ? " Billy asked , his dark eyes shining with excitement . " He said we might go see you fly . " Cleo saw a movement at the living-room window , in the shadows where she had stood yesterday to watch Ty . <p> " Tell your father I 'll be at the Ocala Airport , " Cleo said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy . " Cleo called . " Tell him to get there by 8:30 , or you 'll miss seeing me take off . " <p> Billy started to run again . <p> " Billy , " Cleo called again . The boy stopped and turned around . " Tell your daddy that it would make me very happy if y'all came , " Cleo said . Billy scampered away this time inside the house . Cleo backed out , a smile spreading across her face . <p> Just before she got to the bend that put her house out of sight , in the rear-view mirror she saw Ty standing by his truck watching her go . As she rounded the bend , Cleo thought to herself that there was something eerily familial about Ty 's standing there . <p> Then it struck her . That 's where she usually stood , waving good-bye to Ty . <p> Rose Simmons , a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer , has been writing short stories since she was 14 . <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
