Linda picked up the plastic vial again , turned it over and over in her hand , listening to the silence . She 'd packed the container too full of capsules for there to be any rattle . That effect pleased her . Again she read the cautions on the label . Linda twisted the child-proof cap until both arrows lined up , tried to thumb the cap off , broke her nail instead . She set the vial down beside the sink a little too hard and rubbed the ragged rim of nail against her index finger . Linda started to reach for the emery board in the zippered case by the sink , then hesitated . Why bother ? <p> If she was going to die , it did n't really matter if she looked perfect , though she suddenly remembered her mother 's long-ago admonitions about clean slipped between compressed lips sounded more to her own ears like a whimper . <p> And if she did n't die , there was no one to impress , so why bother ? She remembered her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet and marry a doctor . Linda did n't know at this point whether she wanted to laugh or to cry . <p> She gave the vial an impatient tap on the faux marble . The cap popped free and red capsules pattered across the sink . Several bounced off the toilet ring and into the electric blue water . Linda thought she could see them start immediately to expand like the gel-packed sponge dinosaurs she had once bought for her nephew 's seventh birthday . <p> This was sordid . It took away even more from the mood , and her sense of resolve . Resignedly , she got down on her knees and picked up every capsule she could find . In the comer , three robust ants tried to make off with one of the capsules . She shook them free and scooted the trio toward the baseboard with a piece of Kleenex . Maybe they were depressed too . She thought about mutual pacts , this time could n't stop herself from giggling , looked for the rest of the capsules . The ants wandered away into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capsules went back into the vial and she replaced the cap with a positive click . <p> Another time , perhaps . She had enough capsules , even without the ones that had swirled down the toilet . If she were patient , she could even wait until the prescription was again refilled . She knew full well her doctor would do that . <p> But in the meantime . . . <p> Linda walked tiredly into the living room , flipped on the radio by the faded couch , heard the first notes of a love song she particularly hated , twisted the dial looking for a heavy metal station . Or rap . Or even country . She found none of those among the intermittent cascades of static . All that seemed to be on the air tonight were easy-listening stations with mushy ballads . She aimed the TV remote . Like Water for Chocolate was on HBO . Encore had Zeffirelli 's Romeo and Juliet . And so it went . Love Story on TBS . She slapped the remote . The TV image dwindled into a dot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a message from God , it was a grotesque one . <p> And if it was divine punishment for even mulling the thought of suicide , then God was even more of a thug than Mark Twain had mocked . <p> Linda slipped a Nick Cave album into the CD player , cranked the volume only on the headphones out of deference to her downstairs neighbors , and lay back against the couch pillows . <p> * * *  --  and woke as she felt the bullet , rising toward her on a hot cushion of flame , starting to push toward the softest part of her eye , the membrane distending , the optic nerve shrieking , the pain and the sound rising to a crescendo . Linda blinked furiously , rubbed her eye , only half-noted the staccato reflections of rotating emergency lights crossing the faded rose plaster of her bedroom walls . An ambulance , she realized , orienting herself , the wail of a siren diminishing in the distance . She wondered who had died ? <p> Certainly not her . Maybe no one . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bed , wincing at the sharp pain by the base of her skull . She must have slept completely wrong the crick in her neck was evidence of that . Linda realized she did n't recall moving from the couch to her bedroom . Now her whole head was aching . The vial waited in the bathroom . <p> But when she went into the harsh fluorescent light of the lavatory , she let the faucet run for a whole minute , then used half a glass of the tepid water to wash down three aspirin . <p> In the living room she looked at the clock on the VCR . Half past nine . She had a long , long time until morning , and she did n't want to spend all those hours dreaming . That 's why she put on a light cotton top , her denim skirt , and decided to take a walk . It was an atypically hot early October night and this early there should be plenty of people on the streets . <p> Although , whispered a small voice , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car would suddenly jump the curb , a wall would collapse , a hideously off-course airliner would try to use her street as an emergency landing strip . Maybe a man with a knife or a pistol would step from a dark alley . " Are you talking yourself out of this , or into it ? " she muttered to herself . <p> Linda took her keys and a twenty dollar bill . She hesitated , then took the half-empty pack of Marlboros and a book of matches . When she swung open the door to leave , Mr. Claws screamed from the railing outside and bounded into her apartment . <p> She turned and headed for the kitchen , knowing exactly what Mr. Claws wanted . Mr. Claws was an alley scrapper , a bulky gray cat getting a little long in the fang . Linda had taken him to a vet the month before when it looked like the cat 's left eye was well on the way to liquefying and dropping from its socket . The vet prescribed antibiotics and showed Linda how to clean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid . Mr. Claws had recovered just fine . Both eyes seemed to work now , following squirrels and birds with endless patience when Linda watched him stalking , <p> Now he padded around the kitchen , grumbling and hissing , waiting for Linda to open a can . " Pressed chicken okay , Mr. Claws ? " She took the package from the refrigerator , extracted a slice , then knelt to feed him . The big gray grabbed the meat from her fingers and shook his head as if trying to snap a mouse 's neck . Linda touched the lumpy top of his head . Mr. Claws growled with the chicken still in his mouth and tried to take a swipe at her hand . " Living up to your name , kitty , " said Linda , quickly withdrawing her fingers . " I 'll leave the rest of the chicken in your dish . Suit you ? " <p> She stood and rinsed her fingers in the sink . Mr. Claws happily attacked his evening treat . " Just have a good meal , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . This time use the litter box . " She had reason to believe the cat was box-trained , though he sometimes used the Navajo rug in her living room just to be obnoxious . <p> From the doorway , she said , " You can earn your way tonight . " The cat ignored her . " I 'd really like it if you 'll stay and sleep with me . " The cat still did n't look up from his pressed chicken . <p> Propositioning a stray cat , she thought . Now that 's pitiful . She left the apartment , locking the deadbolt behind her . As she descended the open stairwell , she realized it really was comforting tonight knowing there was something  --  someone  --  to come home to . Even if it was a flagrantly unfaithful big gray eat . <p> Linda 's apartment building was only half a block from Paradise Avenue , and the most immediate mile of Paradise held at least two dozen favored destinations for nighttime wanderers . She strode briskly , passing bars and music clubs , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evening shows , and neon-bright restaurants . <p> At the corner of 18th Street , a red convertible stopped for the light . One among the four boys in the car yelled something at her . Another of the kids whistled . <p> Linda had n't been able to decipher what the one boy had called out , so she gave him the benefit of a doubt . " I 'm as old as your mother , " she said back . <p> The boy grinned . " You do n't look like her . " <p> Linda found it hard not to smile back . The light changed as she stepped into the crosswalk and she quickened her pace . <p> " Last chance , " called the boy . <p> Probably , she thought , stepping onto the opposite curb . My last chance . No doubt . She let the words cool in her mind . The convertible roared away , trailing the squeal of rubber and a chime of laughter . <p> The next block was less populated by passersby and even less well-lit . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if they carried copies of Looking for Mr. Goodbar . Just why am I out here ? Linda thought . Just going for a walk . Just clearing her head . Not looking for anything . Not looking for anyone . <p> Linda knew she was coming up on a club called High Beam . The next block would be busier . She was paying attention to her surroundings , but still was surprised when a man 's voice came out of the darkened alley beside High Beam . <p> " Linda ? " She heard the baritone , knew it was male . Broke her stride , startled . Hesitated , knowing even as she peered into the darkness she should be sprinting for light and other people . Safety . " It is you , is n't it , Linda ? " The man stepped forward and his shape resolved in the light on the sidewalk . <p> She involuntarily took a step back . He did n't look familiar . He was taller than she , though most men were . Maybe six feet . She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker . He smiled and there was a white glistening of teeth . His eyes were dark ; that 's all she could tell . <p> " Yes ? " she said . " Do I know you ? " <p> " We know each other , " he said . " We 've had some long conversations . " <p> She instantly thought back over every crank call she 'd ever gotten . Most of them were hang-ups . She never allowed obscene callers to hang on the line . She refused to feed their hunger . <p> " I think you 're mistaken , " she said uncertainly . " We do n't know each other . But how do you know my name ? " <p> The man stepped farther into the light . Linda took another step back to compensate . She believed she knew something about body language ; this man seemed to offer no threat . <p> " Linda 's a lovely name , " he said . She could see his lips curve in a smile . " You know the Spanish meaning ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like just ' pretty , ' " she found herself saying . <p> The man shook his head emphatically . " Beautiful , " he repeated . His smile widened . " Do you know the old High German ? " <p> She shook her head . <p> " Over there it means serpent . No connotation of something ugly or scaly . Mythic . The suggestion is one of strength , flexibility , power . " <p> She watched him closely , waiting to see if he was going to turn into some sort of berserk maniac . <p> " You 're wondering if I 'm some sort of serial killer , " said the man . <p> Linda did n't shake her head . The thought had occurred to her , though she knew rationally that he was probably just an articulate drunk , or perhaps one of the slightly deranged street people who mixed among the upscale tourists on Paradise Avenue . He wore jeans with no visibly worn patches or holes . His western shirt looked pressed . His black leather jacket did n't appear scuffed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collar . Then she thought , who knows what one looks like ? He could be a serial killer . He could have slaughtered hundreds . How do you tell , save by weighing deeds ? <p> " Well maybe I am , " he said . " But I 'm off-duty for a while . My name is Todd . " He extended his hand . <p> She took it tentatively at first . His hand was much larger than hers , but his grip was firm and warm without being intimidating . She admitted surprise to herself that he did n't offer either the crushing grip or the sensitively limp gesture she was accustomed to from men . There was heat in his hand , and it seemed to flow like a live electric current into her own fingers . She was aware , as she withdrew her hand , that their touching had lasted perhaps a second longer than it should . By whose standards ? the rebellious little voice in her head said , and then laughed softly . She ordinarily gauged these things by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised her . <p> " I bewilder you , " Todd said , half a question , half a statement . " All those questions in your head will get answers . " He cocked his head to one side , looking down at her , into her eyes . The shadows were too dark ; she still could n't tell what color his eyes were . " In the meantime , I 'm going to ask you out for a drink . And how about going dancing later ? " <p> " I do n't dance , " she said automatically . <p> He laughed . " Do n't ? Not ca n't ? I do n't think you 've been dancing in a while , but I 'll bet you could if you decided that was what you wanted . " <p> " Not in a while , " Linda conceded . " I can . " <p> " Then you should . " Todd turned and gestured down Paradise . " Let 's just see what happens . " <p> Linda felt a pang of caution as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe we should try High Beam . " <p> " My thought exactly , " said the man . Linda wondered how old he really was . He looked about Linda 's age . Forty . Perhaps a little older . Maybe a little younger . It was hard to tell . <p> " You 've got nice hair , " he said suddenly . <p> She involuntarily reached back , touching her hair with the fingers of her right hand . " It 's got snow in it , " she heard herself saying . Her mother had said that same thing about her own hair when the glossy black had so quickly started to gray . <p> " Such tension , " Todd said . " The contrast , the lightness playing against the dark , that 's exciting . " He sounded serious . <p> " Smooth talker , " said Linda . " You use that line on all of us ? " <p> " Actually , no . " Todd sounded even more serious . " Usually I need say nothing at all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are n't you ? " <p> He smiled back at her ; ingenuous , she thought . " A drink ? " he said . " A dance ? " <p> " A deal , " Linda said , wondering momentarily why she was saying this , but knowing on another level why . " A drink . And maybe , maybe a dance . " <p> Just inside High Beam , a doorman did n't ask for a cover charge , but he did check Linda 's driver 's license . <p> " Charming , " she said . She could n't remember the last time that had happened . <p> High Beam was an old dance club apparently now fallen on difficult times . The first thing Linda thought as Todd and she walked into the cavernous interior was , maybe they should rename it Low Beam ? It had n't looked this big from the outside . The dance floor stretched back farther than she could accurately gauge in the darkness . It looked as though the walls had once been thickly populated with neon decor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were more purples than anything else , abstract shapes , a few red forms that could have been flames or perhaps the teeth of a saw , part of a green palm thatch , the crest of a bright blue wave . In all the comers at ceiling level , pairs of spotlights swept back and forth in tandem , like headlights rounding a turn . A fog generator coughed out a mist that softened the headlight glare , giving momentary form to the high beam probe . <p> Most of the nearby light seemed to come from a huge and elaborate CD jukebox in the near comer . A myriad of lights , red , blue , white , chased themselves along all the hard chromed edges of the machine . Music boomed from speakers mounted around the dance floor . <p> Linda found her body already beginning to yield treacherously to the beat of the music . She swayed with the fierce chords . The up-tempo rocker made the thick , smoky air vibrate . She took a deep breath . " Who is this ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shrugged . " I think it 's a group called Manichee . " At least that 's what she thought she heard him say . <p> Something suddenly snapped into focus as she stared over to the left , at the neon-limned bar and the stools spaced in front of it . The Manichee piece ended in a minor-key crescendo and the echoes diminished and were gone . <p> " There 's no one here , " said Linda . <p> Todd followed her stare . " That would seem to be the case . " <p> " I would n't even expect us to be the only customers , " she said , still looking at the deserted bar . " No one would leave all that untended . " Linda gestured toward the glittering rows of bottles . <p> " ' Probably just getting some re-stock out of the storeroom , " said Todd . <p> " This is strange . " Linda suddenly felt as though she did n't want to get any closer to the bar . She turned . " Where 's the doorman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's a psychopath . And the people who were here are all lying on the floor back in the storeroom . All tied up . " <p> " I really do n't want to walk into a robbery . " A chili raced along Linda 's neck . <p> " Maybe not just a robbery . " Todd looked serious . " Perhaps they 're all back there in the storeroom on their bellies on the floor with some guy putting a bullet through the back of each of their heads . " <p> Linda clapped a hand to her mouth , forced herself to take it away . She steadied herself . " Not funny , " she said . <p> " No , " he said . " It 's not . " <p> " We 've got a choice , " said Linda . " We could call the police , or we can get out of here . " <p> " Or we can dance . " Todd touched her shoulder lightly . She could feel the heat of his fingers again . <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He stepped closer to her and said , " The people really are back somewhere getting stock . Or maybe taking stock . Or getting laid . I 'm sure of it . I do n't think this place has much of a clientele , even on the best of nights . They 're perfectly safe . So are we . " He took his hand away from her shoulder . " Now . Music . What would you like to hear ? " <p> " What I 'd like and what this fancy machine can play are probably a few miles apart . " <p> The song started then , and the opening chords rocked her back on her heels . " I 'll be damned , " she said , sure Todd could n't hear her now . The volume lowered a notch or two . <p> " Is this something you can live with ? " said Todd . <p> It was , in fact , the song she 'd been thinking of . Not by the King , true ; and a slightly slower tempo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendition . Hoyt Axton 's mommy 's big hit , sung by an unknown voice that sent shivers through her abdomen . <p> Since my baby left me . . . She could sing right along with the words . The song was " Heartbreak Hotel . " <p> He took her hands in his . " Let 's dance . . . " <p> They did , and he was very good . And after the first chorus of " Heartbreak Hotel , " so was she . It was n't the dancing she had to reaccustom herself to . It was holding a partner in her arms . She felt strangely shy . That feeling went away quickly . Linda found herself not so decorously distant from Todd . It felt like a gravitational thing . They moved around the dance floor together , gradually closer . She was n't aware of the process so much as she realized , when the song ended , that they were now very close indeed . <p> The next song was another familiar tune with an unfamiliar arrangement ; this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . <p> He looked down at her . " Pardon ? " <p> Linda said , " The jukebox is playing ' Lonely Women Make Good Lovers . ' " <p> " You like the country version better ? " <p> " That 's not the point , " said Linda . " It 's a great dance tune . It 's also an article of faith for cracker bubbas on the make in every sleazy dive . " <p> " Are you saying it 's sexist ? " said Todd , drawing her very close now , so that her head tucked up close to his chin . <p> She nodded . " That 's about it . " <p> He nodded too , slowly . " I 'm a great student of country , " Todd said . " I 'm a great student of most things , " he added modestly , cutting the effect with a smile Linda could feel against her temple . His lips moved like silk . His voice was a little muffled . He moved his mouth away just enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But so are lonely men . And I 'd rather deal with lonely women any day . " <p> " I 'm sure , " said Linda . <p> " No , really . Guys have their own cliche . Lonely men whimper and bitch a lot more than women . Women ignore it or do what they have to do to get through it . Men start acting like babies , yapping and whining and carrying on like there 's nobody 's business except their own . " <p> Linda felt the warmth of his right hand against the small of her back . Felt the heat of his palm and fingers move a little to the side , resting on the curve of her hip , then back to the center . " Are you some kind of therapist ? " she said . <p> " Nope , " said Todd . <p> " Then what are you ? " <p> " I told you before . " <p> She had to think for a few seconds . It was easier now not to think , but just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end . " The . . . " She was n't sure if she should be keeping her voice light . " The serial killer thing . " He nodded , jaw seeming to generate a static charge as it rubbed against her hair . " You were n't kidding , " she said . <p> " I said I was off-duty , " said Todd . " You can trust me on that . " <p> She knew she could trust him . She also knew she could bring her knee up into his groin , put stiffened fingers into his throat , run for the door , risk hearing his tortured breath and stumbling footsteps behind her . Linda made her decision without really thinking about it . She remembered a time once when she had made certain decisions based on feeling  --  no , more on other intangibles that rarely played her false . This time , after a very long time of ignoring the issue , Linda opted for trust . <p> " Okay , " she said . " Now what do you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to your apartment , " said Todd . " I 'd like to see your cat . " <p> " You know entirely too much , " said Linda . " Are you a detective too ? " <p> " I just know a lot . " The music ended . He gave her a hug , drew away , spread his hands . " You know ? " <p> " No , " she said . " I do n't know . This is stupid . I 'm going to hate myself in the morning . " If I 'm alive in the morning , she said silently . <p> " I do n't think you 'll hate yourself . " Todd sounded serious . " I 'm pretty sure of it . " <p> " I do n't take strange men home from bars , " she said . <p> " I know that , " said Todd . <p> " I do n't go to bed with people I barely know , " she said . Did I actually say that ? she said to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 'm not easy , " she said aloud . I 'm not , she repeated silently . <p> " I know that . " <p> " I 'm not going to do anything with you . " <p> " I know that . " His face was close to hers . <p> " But you can come up for some coffee . " <p> Todd smiled with what looked to Linda like innocent pleasure . Sure , she thought . He 's very , very good . And then she wondered , who was being the most truthful in this strange interchange ? <p> " I do n't do floors and windows , " she said . <p> " I know that too . " He reached for her hand , drew her gently but firmly toward the door of the High Beam . She noticed that the doorman still was not in evidence . She had n't seen him since they 'd entered the club . <p> " Is there anything at all you do n't know ? " Linda said . <p> For the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice . Fatigue ? Or perhaps it was something like wistfulness . " There are things , " he said . " And wondering about them keeps me from going . . . stir-crazy with boredom . " <p> She squeezed his fingers . <p> " And not just things , " Todd said . " People , sometimes . You . " <p> They left the High Beam . She sensed the headlights snapping out . Behind them , she heard the jukebox start to belt out a polka version of " Are You Lonesome Tonight ? " <p> * * * Paradise Avenue was deserted . <p> " Where is everybody ? " said Linda . She had never seen the street completely without pedestrians . <p> " Back at the club , " said Todd . " That storeroom where everybody 's lying on their bellies ? It 's big . " <p> " You 're sick , " she said . <p> He nodded . <p> They walked a while in silence . " Do you live around here ? " Linda said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for long ? " <p> " I 've only got so much energy , " he said . " And only so much time . " <p> She said , " I guess you 're being honest . " <p> He nodded . " I am . " <p> They got to her street . Linda took his arm and turned him away from the avenue . As they walked beneath the canopies of oak and elm just starting to turn with the autumn , Todd said , " I find this very beautiful . " <p> " It 's my favorite season . " Linda wanted this part of the walk home to last forever . She knew exactly how many steps there were between the warm pools of light from the old streetlamps . A breeze started to rise , rattling the leaves overhead like dry bones . <p> " We 've something in common , " said Todd . " The fall 's my favorite too . " <p> " Is that all we 've got in common ? " She regretted the words as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hated sounding shallow . <p> He seemed to take the question seriously . " There is more , " he said . He did n't elaborate . She did n't press . <p> Another two pools of light , the quality of illumination seeming to flicker as wind-tossed branches swept in front of the electric lights . Linda shivered in the rising wind . Todd took off his leather jacket and draped it around her shoulders . <p> " We 're almost there , " she said . " Thanks . " <p> And then they were there , and climbing the outside steps to the second floor landing . Even with Todd 's jacket around her , Linda shivered as she keyed the deadbolt , then turned the other key in the latch . <p> Inside , she luxuriated for a moment in the warmth . She shrugged off the leather jacket and reached for the light switch . Then she felt Todd 's fingers lightly on her wrist . He stood behind her , took the jacket from her left hand . Linda heard leather sigh to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Todd . <p> " And the coffee ? " <p> " For later , " he said . <p> Linda suddenly wished she had taken time to file her broken nail . She knew he was standing close , close behind her . The warmth on the back of her head was his breath . It smelled a bit like cloves and orange peel . The small hairs on the back of her neck prickled , the graying hair above seemed to crackle with electricity . He could not be closer without touching . <p> Linda felt his hands alight on her shoulders , fingers cupping those shoulders , two spots of radiant heat . She knew she was acting now without thinking as she leaned back against him , adjusting her body to accommodate his . Her hips touched his thighs ; she felt the length of his legs against the backs of hers . The top of her head tucked beneath his chin . Her back relaxed . <p> " My shoulder blades are sharp , " she said . <p> " I like them that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been . <p> " Is that a kind of serial killer thing ? " Linda was n't sure whether she said that aloud or not . But she did know she was smiling . And when Todd took his right hand from her shoulder and let his fingers caress the line of her jaw and then brush across her lips , she gently took one finger into her mouth . <p> They stood like that a long , long while as the room seemed to get warmer . Linda felt his breath move down the back of her head to her neck , felt Todd 's mouth lightly touch the nape of her neck , felt the quick , hot dart of tongue against her skin . <p> She thought she cried out . At first just a little , and later , quite a lot . His left arm encircled her front , his hand cupping her right breast without quite touching it . <p> " Tease , " she said , from around his finger . Linda reached up and pushed the hand against her breast . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't want you to think I 'm a tease . " <p> " Then do n't be . " She felt his fingers slide between the buttons of her top . She wondered if he was as surprised as she how hard her nipple had become . And how sensitive . <p> " I do n't do this . " <p> Todd smiled against her hair . <p> That was the last silly thing she remembered saying . <p> There were some things she did remember . <p> Linda remembered when they first were there in her big comfortable bed , the bed in which two people had never slept together . The bed which she had bought after Jack died . She handed Todd the small packet which he took , then lifted up to examine in the candlelight . <p> " It 's old , " she said apologetically . " I never expected an occasion to use it . " <p> He began laughing . " I 'm safer than you can imagine , " he said . <p> Linda said , " Indulge me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came back later , a kind of overlay of the past on the present , though the past was so long ago , Linda thought she had buried it thoroughly . <p> The memories started to flood back with every single thing Todd did to her . <p> And when she climaxed , letting the heat and sheer sensation claim her as she had not experienced in nearly two decades , Linda began to cry . Todd held her , touching her hair and her skin , comforting her when she wanted comfort , giving her silence when she craved a temporary wall o privacy , while she felt the tears well from her eyes and leave trails of salt across her lips . <p> " I do n't do this , " she finally said in a low voice . I do n't come and I do n't cry , not like this , she said inside her head . <p> " I know that , " he said , and this time she knew he really did , though she honestly did not know how he could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And after he held her for a long , long time even tighter and closer , and after he kissed her a few more times , he told her .

" <p> He was sitting up now , back against the headboard , knees drawn up . " And I told the truth . " Linda leaned against him , wrapped her arms around his knees . " Do you have some idea of our meeting ? " <p> She nodded . " I 'm not stupid . " <p> " But you have been  --  " He seemed to fumble for words . " You 've been frozen . In a kind of prison cell . " <p> " I had to protect myself , " she said . " Thanks to you . " <p> Todd looked away . " I ca n't be ashamed . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I owe you . I 'm not , " he said , voice rising . She reached and touched his face . He seemed to relax just a little . <p> " We 've been more than just acquaintances , " said Linda . " I suppose it was inevitable we become lovers . " <p> " No . " Todd shook his head . " ' It was not in any way predestined that we do this . " He hesitated . " But I wanted us to . " <p> " And I guess maybe I did too , " Linda said slowly . " Jack , Mom , all the others you came to embrace . My nephew  --  he was only seven , you son of a bitch . I argued , remember. ? I screamed and cried and begged . I used logic and I tried bargaining . " In her mind 's eye , what she saw were the sick-beds and the hospital wards and the nursing homes and the funeral parlors . She smelled the cloying odors of farewell , and again tasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not easy , " said Todd . <p> " Do n't I know it . " Linda leaned closer to kiss him , the touch long and lingering on his lips , the taste a little bitter . " What now ? " <p> Todd looked away , then back , meeting her eyes . " Morning . I 've got places to go . " He smiled . " People to meet . You know . " <p> " Yes . " She nodded . " I believe I do . But things between us are n't the same . " <p> Todd sighed . " Nope , they 're not . " <p> " Morning 's a while yet , " said Linda . " Kiss me a few more times . " <p> " I will do that , " Todd said . And he did even more . <p> They stood in the open doorway of Linda 's apartment . The eastern sky above the city 's skyline lightened . <p> " Be honest , " she said . <p> " I 'm always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willfully misunderstand me . " <p> " Be honest , " she said again . <p> " All right , " he said . " Okay . Do n't badger me . " He took a deep breath , looked her in the eye . His gaze did n't waver . <p> " You 're stalling . " She surprised herself that she could manage the tiniest of smiles . <p> He acknowledged it , smiling himself , touching her lips lightly with his right index finger , passing it across her mouth , pausing when he encountered the moist tip of her tongue just barely extending beyond those soft lips . " Very good , " he said . " You 've regained so much . " <p> " But too late , " she whispered . <p> Todd shrugged , stepped closer to her , now within an intimate radius . " I think I could grow to love you . " He sounded a little surprised with himself as he passed the flat of his hand across her eyes . For just a moment , the blackest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approaching new morning returned . " Too late . " This time he really did laugh . " I do love you . " <p> Linda thought about that . She stared boldly into the deep , dark wells of his eyes . " But you 're leaving me . " <p> " For a while . " He spread his hands as though helpless . " I know what that sounds like . " <p> " Should I wait ? " said Linda , wondering what answer he 'd choose . <p> No hesitation , but his smile widened . " Those pills in the bathroom ? Use them for headaches , or give ' em to the ants . Trust me to catch up with you . " <p> " I can do that . " <p> " Honest , " he said . " I 'll come again . " The smile grew even further . " And so will you . " He winked . <p> He brushed his lips against hers . She felt the fire . Linda believed him . And knew that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There was some disturbance at their feet . Todd glanced down at Mr. Claws , who was glaring balefully up at them both , no doubt impatient for his pressed chicken . <p> " Nice kitty , " said Todd . " What a great old cat . " <p> " Do n't even think it , " said Linda . " He 's with me . " <p> This time Todd laughed out loud . " I can live with that . " He offered her a final kiss . " And he can live with you . For now . " He coughed . " Sorry . That 's not too comforting . " <p> " You 've never been a comfort , " she said . <p> Todd looked for a moment as if he was deciding whether to say something . Decided . " Listen , what you said before about being too late ? " He shook his head . " I just want you to know , you 've got some time . I ca n't tell you how much . It 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped away from around his mouth as he smiled . " Time is something to use well , okay ? " Finger to his lips , kiss transferred to her lips , and then he turned and descended the stairs . The sound of his steps echoed and dissipated and was gone . <p> Light sleeted across the city 's horizon . <p> Mr. Claws gurgled in his thick , furry throat . <p> " Okay , " said Linda . " Breakfast . " <p> Later , in the bathroom , she set one of the red capsules from the vial down in the corner for the ants to carry away . If they wished . The rest she placed deep in the medicine cabinet where they would not get in the way . <p> ILLUSTRATION : " I suspect Dr. Kervorkian had a hand in this .
