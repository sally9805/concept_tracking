1938 Pei Pei glanced down into the dark , glassy water of Hong Kong harbor and suddenly felt shy and wordless . She saw herself as a child again , whom , at the age of eight , her father had taken to the girls ' house in the village of Yung Kee . Compared to their small farm , everything had been big and frightening . For nineteen years , Pei had lived and worked with Lin doing the silk work , only this time , Lin 's patience and kindness would n't be waiting for her when she arrived . Now , she alone would have to care for Ji Shen in the big , vibrant city ; the thought terrified her . At fourteen , Ji Shen was almost half Pei 's age , and had already been orphaned once , fleeing from the Japanese devils in Nanking . She had miraculously found her way to the girls ' house , where Pei and Lin had nursed her back to health . As the Imperial Japanese Army closed in on Canton , they 'd made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . That the past weeks had been spent in constant movement was a saving grace . Pei 's days had been filled with the needs of Ji Shen and with their impending voyage . When the ferry groaned and finally docked , it swayed from side to side , knocking and creaking against the wooden pier . As the crowd pushed to disembark , Pei stopped abruptly at the railing and stared down at the clapboard ramp that led to the crowded pier . " We have to keep moving , " Ji Shen whispered , gently urging her forward . Pei held onto her cloth sacks and inched toward the ramp . Highshrieking voices pierced the air , attacking them from every direction . Pei felt a sharp jab from someone behind , then stepped down the ramp into the dizzying , hypnotic life that would now be hers and Ji Shen 's . " Hong Kong 's so crowded , " Ji Shen said , clutching the sleeve of Pei 's white tunic . " Yes . " Pei smiled wearily . She hoped Ji Shen could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buzzed with movement . Ships from all over the world were docked in Hong Kong harbor , ships with long , complicated names written on their sides . Sampans huddled together , filled with families who lived their lives on the boats crowded , swaying decks . Faces glared at them , then quickly turned away . There were more Westerners than Pei had ever seen . Even many of the Chinese women were dressed in Western clothing . From the pier they turned left and walked down the crowded street , sidestepping swarms of people as if in a dance , sweating in the humidity . The salty pungent smells and high whining voices were overwhelming . They passed endless stalls of merchants , selling silk stockings , flowers , fresh fruit , and hot noodles in soup . Filthy , toothless beggars thrust their wooden bowls out , hoping for a coin or two . Ji Shen squeezed Pei 's arm tighter as they fought their way through the crowd . A long , jagged line of rickshaws and their drivers snaked from one end of the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope of money and the letter Chen Ling had given her with the names and addresses of other silk sisters who had made their way to Hong Kong . " Go to the address at the top of the list , " Chen Ling had directed . In her other hand , Pei grasped her belongings , including the cloth bag Moi had insisted she take . Pei carefully swung it over her shoulder , the jars of herbs and dried fruits clinking against one another . " Ride , missees ? Cheap deal ! " A barefoot boy wearing once-white cotton pants and shirthe was no older , Pei guessed , than thirteen or fourteenstopped in front of them . A pointed straw hat hung from a string around his neck , thumping against his back . He pointed to a red-and-green rickshaw , which sat next to a nearby stone wall . On the ground beside it , an older woman in mismatched , soiled clothing cradled two smaller children on a straw mat . " I 'll give you a much better price ! " another voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , thank you . " Pei took a step forward , but neither rickshaw driver moved . " Cheapest deal in Hong Kong ! " the boy repeated . Pei pulled Chen Ling 's letter from her pocket and looked past Ji Shen and the rickshaw drivers toward the crowded street ahead . In the weeks before Lin died , she had told Pei of going to Hong Kong with her father as a little girl . Across the street was a large open spacethe one Lin had said was Statue Square . Statue Square was where the Government House and city hall stood , flanked by the precipitous green hills that loomed over everything . Pei caught her breath at the sight . " Where are we going ? " Ji Shen asked . Pei cleared her throat . " Over there . " She straightened her shoulders and began walking toward the square . " Please , missees , cheapest deal in all of Hong Kong ! " The boy was still following them . " Do n't listen to him . " The older man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a few feet ! " Pei stopped . She put down her belongings and looked up at the darkening sky . It was getting late . Statue Square would have to wait until another day . From the corner of her eye , Pei could see another rickshaw driver approaching them . She turned toward the boy . His smile grew wide now that he 'd gained Pei 's attention . She pointed to the address at the top of Chen Ling 's letter . " Do you know where this is ? " The older rickshaw driver coughed and then spat on the ground in front of them . " Only a fool would choose a boy to do a man 's job ! " he said , stomping away . The boy studied the letter for a few moments . Finally , he nodded his head in recognition . " In Wan Chai , not so far from here . No problem , I 'll have you there in no time , " the boy boasted . He glanced quickly at Ji Shen . Pei hesitated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Maybe we should try " " Yes , yes , right away . " The boy nodded again . He ran back to the woman sitting on the ground , whispered some words to her , then grabbed the rickshaw and quickly pulled it toward Pei and Ji Shen . " Right away , right away ! I know just the place . No need to worry . " He stepped aside , offering Pei and Ji Shen help up into his rickshaw . Pei suddenly remembered the stories she 'd heard of rickshaw pullers doubling and even tripling prices once they arrived at their passengers ' destination . Lin had told her to settle on a price immediately , before climbing up into the seat . " How much ? " Pei asked , fingering the Hong Kong coins she 'd gotten at the exchange in Canton . She kept her voice low and confident . " Do n't worry , missee . " The boy smiled . " I 'll bring you there for a fair price . " When they 'd settled on a fare , Ji @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the torn leather seat next to her , proud of her first Hong Kong transaction . The boy jumped between the wooden poles , squatting low to grip a pole in each hand . " Do n't worry . Quan will get you there . " Pei felt sorry for him and wondered how such a skinny boy would be able to pull them more than a few feet , but Quan straightened his back , tightened his leg muscles , lifted up the poles , and moments later had them gliding smoothly down the crowded street . He called out , " Coming through ! Coming through ! " to urge the crowds and waiting rickshaw drivers out of his way . Ji Shen let out a scream and covered her eyes when they barely missed knocking down another driver . " I 'll kill you next time ! " the man shouted after them , raising his fists at them , but Quan simply turned around and yelled back , " You have to catch me first ! " All the colorful , crowded shops that lined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the fading light of early evening , the street seemed to open up and come alive right before their eyes . Bars , curio shops , food stalls , fish stands , a shoe repair shop , a dress shop all blended together . Bright , harsh lights hissed and flashedgarish red , green , and yellow against the oncoming darkness . Pei had never seen anything like it , not even when she 'd visited Canton with Lin . A quick spirit seemed to live here in Hong Kong , making everyone and everything move faster and louder than they did anywhere else she 'd been . After weaving in and out of dozens of streets , Quan rounded a corner down a narrow lane , which , though quieter , was just as dense with people and brightly lit shops . He drew the rickshaw to a stop , then turned around to face them . Pei looked up at the narrow , grayish building , which rose four or five stories above an herbalist 's shop . Signs plastered across the front window advertised ginseng and snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop , an entrance led upstairs . The small window in the door was covered with a flimsy lace curtain . At one time the door must have been painted an auspicious bright red ; now most of the paint had flaked down to the pale brown wood . In the fading light , the building looked tired and forlorn . " Here , missees , this is the place . " The boy carefully lowered the wooden poles and offered his dirty , callused hand to help them down from thc rickshaw . Pei accepted his help . " Is it safe here ? " The words slipped from her lips . " As sale as anywhere in Wan Chai . Just do n't go wandering around alone at night . There are many foreign-devil sailors looking for a good time , and bad men roaming the streets at night . " Quan shook his head from side to side as if to make his point , his hands brushing against Ji Shen 's long braid as he helped her down and signaled for them to follow him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pei and Ji Shen followed Quan as if he were an adult , not a young boy barely older than Ji Shen . Strangely , Pei had felt comfortable with him from the moment she touched his callused hands . He swaggered up to the door and rapped hard three times . When no one answered , he knocked again , harder and louder . Pei held the letter up against the dim light to see the name and address again . " Song Lee " was written in neat black characters . Chen Ling told her Song Lee had been in Hong Kong for over eight years now , and would help Pei just as she had helped other sisters who had left Yung Kee . " She was a good worker , " Chen Ling had said . " Tell her that I gave you her name . The last thing I heard was that she had found work in a good household . " At last , they heard the slow scrape of footsteps . Ji Shen held tightly onto Pei 's arm . Then an irritated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm coming ! " The lace curtains parted and dark , suspicious eyes glared out at them . " I beg your pardon . " Pei stepped forward . " We are looking for a Song Lee . I was given this address as a place I might find her . " The lace curtains fluttered closed , and in a few moments , they heard the door unlatch and open just a crack . " What village are you from ? " the woman asked . " The village of Yung Kee . " " Are you from the sisterhood ? " Pei nodded . " Yes . I was told by Chen Ling that Song Lee might be able to help us . " The door swung open wider , and they stood in front of a thin , wiry woman in her forties who glanced at Pei 's clothing and lacquered-black hair and chignon , then at Ji Shen 's long single braid . " Come in , come in . I 'm sorry for all the questions , but you must be careful in this area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pei stepped in , then turned around , remembering Quan . " No , no , I 'll carry this up for you , " he said , stepping in behind them . " All part of the service . " Single file , they followed the woman up a dark , narrow stairway , their steps resonating . Once upstairs , the building was slightly more inviting . The first floor had a high ceiling , which at least kept the building cool and comfortable . Doors to other rooms opened in three directions . The woman did n't say another word until they reached the landing . " This way , " she said . She led them through the middle door into a small , yet comfortable sitting room . There was an old sofa , a few chairs , and a small cabinet , which held a few small jade pieces . " You must be thirsty . Let me bring you some tea . " Quan smiled , then spoke to the woman in a cheerful , bargaining voice , a street voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman bowed her head slightly toward Pei and Ji Shen . " We will talk about that when I return with tea . " She smiled . " Please , make yourselves comfortable . " Pei looked around at the worn furniture . Her tongue flicked across her parched lips . She reached deep into her pocket and brought out a small silk pouch , from which she extracted several coins . " Here , this is for you , " she said to Quan . " You 've been very kind to help us . " Quan glanced at the money . " Too much , " he said . " Just what we agreed on . " " Please , take it , " Pei insisted . Quan hesitated , then quickly pocketed the coins . " I 'll stay a little longer . Just in case you need me to bring you somewhere else tonight , " he said shyly , watching Ji Shen . When the woman returned , she sat down , poured each of them a cup of tea , and spoke words Pei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am Ma-ling Lee . I was also a member of the sisterhood , though I left it many years ago to come to Hong Kong . When other sisters began migrating to Hong Kong , I decided that they might need a place to stay while they decided what to do . Hong Kong is a large , sometimes frightening place . " Ma-ling sipped her tea . " You can stay here as long as you like , but there is a small fee . Many sisters have passed through this way . Most of them find work in a household within a few months . The less fortunate ones find whatever work they can . " " What kind of work ? " Ji Shen asked . Ma-ling smiled . " We 'll talk about that another time . You two must be tired . Let me show you where you can sleep . " " And Song Lee ? " Pei asked . Ma-ling stood . " You can see her tomorrow . Right now she 's working as a domestic for a household up on the Peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing in the morning , " she offered . Pei smiled . " We 're very grateful . " Quan parted with them at the foot of the stairs . " I 'm sure you 'll be all right here , " he said . " It looks as if she can get in touch with your friend . " " Thank you , " Ji Shen said . Quan blushed . " If you ever need anything , just ask for Quan . I 'm around Wan Chai a lot . People here know me . " He backed slowly down the stairs . A moment later , they heard the front door open and quietly click behind him . The room Ma-ling brought them up to was not what Pei had expected . Once a large , open space , it was now divided into numerous smaller rooms by thin wooden partitions that did n't reach the ceiling . If Pei stood on her toes she could look over the partitions from one space to the next . They walked down the narrow aisle that separated the cubicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton curtain most of the curtains were askew . Bare and clean , each small cubicle held two single cots and a wooden chair . Ma-ling told them there were some larger cubicles in the back with two sets of bunk beds . " You can have this room . " Ma-ling stopped and pointed to a cubicle with a curtained window that looked out on a small , colorless concrete courtyard . For a moment , Pei stood looking out at the graying darkness . " Thank you . " She tried to smile , grateful at least for the window . " Everything will look better in the morning , " Ma-ling assured her . " The bathroom is down the hall . There are only a few other sisters staying with us now , so it should be quiet . The kitchen is downstairs . I 'll bring you up some tea and sweet buns in case you 're hungry . " " Thank you for everything , " Pei said , too exhausted to say anything else . Ma-ling closed the door behind them , leaving Pei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had come so far from their life in Yung Kee and the silk factory . With the Japanese now occupying most of China , she wondered whether Chen Ling and Ming were safely hidden away at the temple in the countryside where they 'd taken refuge , and whether Moi would be all right by herself at the girls ' house . Pei tried to push these thoughts out of her mind . Yet she could n't stop wondering if she had made the right choice leaving Yung Kee . Her doubt was like the constant prickling of bristles . " It 's as if everything 's alive here . " Ji Shen 's voice rose and filled the small space . Pei inhaled , the warm air tasting slightly stale . " I suppose it 's time we join in , " she heard herself respond . She looked around at the bare , colorless cubicle that was now their home , then hurried to open the window , letting in the demanding , boisterous voices from outside . * * * That night , in a restless sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friend 's sweet , calm voice telling her that everything would be all right . At twenty-seven , Pei had spent almost twenty years of her life with Lin , first at the girls ' house with Auntie Yee and Moi , and then at the sisters ' house , where their life took on the comfortable rhythm of work at the silk factory . Pei was amazed at how easy it was to forget . Suddenly gone were the raw , sore fingers from soaking the cocoons in boiling water , the long , grueling hours of standing on damp concrete floors , the lives that were lost in their union 's struggle against the rich factory owners . And Lin 's death . It was n't just Lin 's death that tormented her , but how she had died , and what had gone through her mind as she gasped for breath , slowly suffocating in the devastating fire that destroyed the silk factory . In the past month , Pei had learned what to hold on to , and what to discard . Instead , Pei dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her smallest questions , even before Pei could ask them . When she first came to work at the silk factory , the steamy , sweet-sweaty smell of the soaking cocoons seeped into every pore of her skin , clung to her clothes , hung on every strand of her hair . It was so persistent , yet so subtle a scent , Pei thought it would n't ever wash out . " Wash your hair with this , " Lin had told her one evening when they 'd returned to the girls ' house . She held up a bottle filled with an amber liquid . When Lin shook it , white jasmine petals drifted through the liquid , floating slowly back down to the bottom of the bottle . " Does it work ? " Lin stepped closer . " Here , smell , " she directed . From that day on , the scent of jasmine became a part of Pei 's everyday life . Just after the girls had washed their hair , the strong , sweet smell rose up and filled their room at the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lin . Even the clean smell of Auntie Yee 's ammonia was no match for the jasmine . Again , Pei smelled jasmine in her dreams . Ammonia . Cocoons boiling in hot water . The fragrance of Moi 's cooking wafting from under the kitchen door they were forbidden to open without knocking first . Again , Pei stood at the bottom of the wide wooden stairway that led up to their rooms . She heard a sound , a small intake of breath , and looked up to see Lin , radiant in her white burial gown , walking down the steps toward her . " I 've been waiting for you , " Lin said , smiling . Pei opened her mouth , but at first no words emerged . She felt so dizzy she thought she might faint . Lin answered her question even before she had asked it . " Yes , it 's me . " " I 've missed you . " Pei finally found her voice . " More than you can know . " " I do know . " Lin took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . " Pei held onto Lin 's hand , never wanting to let go . It seemed so real in hers she squeezed it tighter , feeling Lin 's warm softness in her own large , rough hand . " But who 's waiting ? " she asked . " Still so curious . " Lin smiled . " You 'll soon see . " She swept a strand of Pei 's hair away from her face , then swung open the double doors to the reading room . Pei 's heart raced . She glanced around the crowded room . The smell of burning incense was overpowering . Shadows flickered across the walls . The chairs were filled with women dressed in the white cotton trousers and tunic of the sisterhood . Pei closed her eyes and opened them against the thick , stinging air . She touched Lin 's sleeve to make sure she was really there beside her . Faces from the past appeared fresh and young . " Come , come in , " called a high , shrill voice . Pei knew it immediately : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older woman , fell to her knees before her chair , and threw her arms around her . She breathed deeply . The faint clean smell of ammonia rose above the incense . " It 's been so long , " Pei whispered into Auntie Yee 's neck . Auntie Yee squeezed her tightly before letting go . " You 've grown into a fine young woman , just as I knew you would . " " Yes , you have , " another voice added . Pei faintly remembered it . She stood up and looked closely at all the faces that surrounded her . " Who ? " she asked . " It 's me , " the voice said . Moving out and away from the other sisters was Mei-li , who appeared just as she had so many years ago , before she had drowned herself . " Mei-li ? " Pei asked . " And do n't forget me , " another voice rang out . Sui-Ying stood by the side of Mei-likind , sweet Sui-Ying , who had been killed during their strike for better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gods that these two friends would find the peace they so richly deserved . Like Lin 's their lives had ended much too soon . Then , from the corner of her eye , Pei saw movement from behind the others . The flash of gray hair stood out among the rest . Pei strained to see beyond the sisters in front of her , hoping to catch another glimpse . She wondered if this could really be . The last time Pei had seen her mother , Yu-sung , she had been so thin and fragile . " Ma Ma , " Pei said softly , then again , louder . The hum of voices died down around her . Yu-sung stepped forward . Her gray hair was neatly combed back . She smiled widely and said , " Yes , my tall daughter . I 'm here . " Growing up , Pei had rarely seen a smile cross her mother 's lips , Now it glowed before her as bright as any light . Pei took a step forward and began to say something , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurred and burned behind her eyes . " It 's all right , " Ma Ma said . " You have done well in life , just as I always knew you would . After you and Lin visited , I knew I could leave your world in peace . " Pei hung on to her mother for as long as she could , but soon she felt Lin lean near and heard her whisper , " You have to leave now . " Pei shook her head . " I do n't want to leave . I want to stay here with all of you . " Yu-sung pulled away . " That ca n't be . It is n't your time yet . There are too many things you must still do . Do n't forget your baba , and your elder sister , Li . " Pei began to cry , at first softly and then without restraint . She felt Lin take hold of her arm , pull her gently away from the others . Ma Ma stood before her , whispering words she could no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight to Lin . " Not you , too , " she said , through tears . " Not again . " " You have to go on with your life in Hong Kong , just as we planned . We will be together again one day , " Lin whispered . " I promise . " Voices . Footsteps . A dull thump against the fragile partition . Pei awoke . In the darkness she felt lost . A thin , pale light filtered into the room . Ji Shen slept soundly in the bed across from her . Pei closed her eyes again , struggling hard to hold on to the memory of Lin 's sweet , lingering fragrance of jasmine . Song Lee Song Lee quickened her steps , already late to meet the two new sisters waiting for her at Ma-ling 's . Wan Chai was crowded and noisy . In the past year , since the Japanese devils had seized Beijing and continued their march southward , more and more people had flowed into Hong Kong from Canton . Along with the crowds , the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually put on in the eight years since she had arrived in Hong Kong left Song Lee gasping for air . That morning , when the young boy with Ma-ling 's message arrived at the gate of the house she worked at , Song Lee had already made plans for her Sunday afternoon . She 'd intended to meet some of her other sisters at the Go Sing Teahouse in the Central District . There , the latest news and gossip were eagerly delivered . The sisterhood from Yung Kee and other villages had remained strong in Hong Kong . Most of the sisters were known to be clean and hardworking . Nearly all were enthusiastically accepted as amahs and servants in wealthy households , both Chinese and British . The majority of the sisters now working in Hong Kong had been in the sisterhood back in the delta region of Guangdong province for many years , and had gone through the hairdressing ceremony , pledging their lives to the silk sisterhood . Song Lee knew the Hong Kong Tai tais had their own term , sohei , to describe their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were less at risk of attracting philandering husbands , and their services quickly grew in value . Some sisters could n't adapt to domestic work and were soon replaced . But for the most part , the sisterhood continued to thrive in Hong Kong . Organizing themselves much as they had in the silk work , they remained strong in numbers . Loan associations and retirement committees were quickly formed to help sisters who found their way to Hong Kong . In no time , Song Lee became an active participant in helping the new arrivals adjust to living and working in Hong Kong . Like most of her sisters , Song Lee had had a lifetime of adjusting . She was the only daughter of a poor farmer and his wife . Her two older brothers were granted what little her parents had to offer them , both materially and emotionally , while Song Lee was given to the silk work when she was six , earlier than most . For months she refused to speak to anyone and cried herself to sleep every night . She lay small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , narrow room . Then one night Song Lee heard another girl crying , the soft hiccuping breaths drawing her attention away from her own misery . She listened in the darkness , mesmerized by the strangely comforting lullaby . For the first time , she realized that she was n't alone . Every girl in the room had been abandoned by a family she loved . A dozen years later , Song Lee had pledged her life to helping her sisters in whatever way she could . By the time Song Lee reached the boardinghouse , she was hot and thirsty . The two new sisters were waiting for her as Ma-ling ushered her into the sitting room . " Please , please , do n't get up , " Song Lee said . She let her thick body fall onto the sofa next to the young girl , across from the older , strikingly tall sister , who watched Song Lee 's every move with sharp , inquisitive eyes . " Thank you for coming all this way , " the tall Pei said , relaxing into a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for work . Hong Kong is so big , so crowded . " " I hope I can make your transition easier . " Song Lee smiled . She rummaged through her bag for the red , gold-trimmed paper fan at the bottom , and snapped it open . The slight movement of sticky air brought her little relief . Song Lee watched Pei closely for a moment . She must have helped more than a hundred sisters relocate and find domestic positions since she herself had come to Hong Kong . Now she prided herself on reading each woman 's face as if it were a map of her life , with hints in every line and crevice . Even if Song Lee did n't know a woman 's final destination in life , she could guess in which direction she was headed . Sometimes the clue was as subtle as a young woman 's slightly protruding forehead , or the delicate downward curve of her lips . Each small feature foreshadowed a person 's destiny . So many times Song Lee 's heart ached when she detected future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sharp knives pointing upward , had foolishly played up to the master of the house , become pregnant , and been kicked out by his wife . Afterward , the sisterhood had a hard time placing her . Word had spread , and no Chinese Tai tai would take her . She eventually found work washing clothes for an English family . Another young girl , whose eyes were always moist and watery , cried suddenly at the slightest word or glance . Her employers were at a loss for what to do with her , and when she returned to the sisterhood in tears , Song Lee was exasperated , too . In cases like these , Song Lee simply had to look the other way . There was little she could do against a fate that had already been set . She could only hope that what she detected as a flaw would be balanced by some other favorable feature she had n't seen . Song Lee 's own life had been no less difficult , and though that did n't show on her round , prosperous face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she carried on the back of her neck . If the same mole had been on the front of her neck , and carrying her , Song Lee 's life might have followed an easier path . The face of this woman , Pei , told a different story . Song Lee saw a quiet strength in the bridge of Pei 's nose , along with intelligence in the deep-set eyes . If Ji Shenwhose face lacked a certain definition , with its flatter nose bridge and sloping foreheadminded Pei , then she too , would be all right . Pei was also old enough hot to make some of the foolish mistakes that other younger sisters had . Song Lee saw a complex journey ahead , but one Pei could most likely manage . Over the past years , Song Lee had learned to move slowly , leading each woman carefully into the specifics of her new life . She drank down her tea , cleared her throat , and spoke in her high , melodious voice . " The sisterhood has been good to me , and the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides " Song Lee smiled " I have always believed good fortune will someday return to me . But tell me , how arc Chen Ling and Ming ? " " Well , we hope , " Pei said , her smile disappearing . " They have given themselves to the Buddhist faith and joined a vegetarian hall in the countryside . They were to leave the day after we left Yung Kee . I ca n't help wondering whether they 're all right . " Song Lee leaned forward . " If anyone will be all right , it 's Chen Ling . She has the strength of a dozen men ! " Pei and Ji Shen relaxed . They spoke of Yung Kee and the silk work , until Song Lee sat back and raised her hand as if to wave away the recollection . " Most of the sisters who have come to Hong Kong do domestic work now , " Song Lee said . She poured herself another cup of tea . " It is a small island , after all , and word spreads quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a position . Most families prefer us above all others as their children 's amahs . " " Why ? " Ji Shen asked . " Because we have come from a working background , and we 've proved to be stable and reliable , " Song Lee answered . " Will I be able to work , too ? " Ji Shen asked . It was the first time she had uttered a full sentence since Song Lee had arrived . Song Lee smiled at the girl . " I 'll have to talk to some of the other sisters , but I 'm sure we can find you a place " " No , " Pei quickly said . " I 'm sorry to interrupt , but I would like Ji Shen to finish her education . " " But " Ji Shen began . " You 're still young enough to choose another path . It 's important to me , " Pei continued , lowering her voice seriously . " In a few years , you can do whatever you want . " Then , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For now , I 'm the only one who will need to find a position . " Song Lee nodded . She sipped the slightly bitter tea , then adjusted the collar of her tunic , which was getting too tight . Perhaps she had been wrong ; this tall sister 's strength was not so quiet after all . Fragrant Harbor Three days later , Pei followed the directions Song Lee had given her to the Bing Tao Fa Yuen , the botanical gardens across from the governor 's palace . She had thought about hiring Quan to take her up , but decided she should learn the streets of Hong Kong as fast as she could . Walking would assure her of a quick challenge . After making sure Ji Shen would be comfortable staying with Ma-ling , Pei set off to meet Song Lee and the other sisters who would help her seek work . " Come meet some of the other sisters on the committee , Song Lee had said . " It is important to make as many connections as you can here in Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pei nervously agreed , wondering if she 'd even be competent to do domestic work . With the help of Song Lee , she had no choice but to enter this new world , of which she knew so little . A crush of people enveloped her as soon as Pei rounded the corner from the boardinghouse . She suddenly became acutely conscious of her surroundings . The sour smells of sweat and urine , the oily odor of Chinese doughnuts frying , the heady fumes from the many motorcars , the high-pitched voices of vendors . In the quivering afternoon heat , even the bright daytime blend of garish color was jarring . Pei had never seen so many big , dark motorcars , which roared and raced at her from every direction . " Metal monsters , " she muttered under her breath as she dodged across a crowded street . The crowds thinned and Pei 's panic calmed as she left the noisy streets of Wan Chai and began the upward climb along paved streets toward the gardens . Beautiful brick and stucco houses stood large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the muscles of her legs pull as she walked briskly up the incline . The flat , open space of Yung Kee had had almost no hills ; climbing the streets of Hong Kong left her hot and breathless . As the streets grew gradually steeper , she tried to imagine making her way back down again . One slip , and she might roll all the way back to Wan Chai ! When she was high enough to see the shimmering blue-gray water below , Pei paused and turned around . Ships dotted the harbor . Across from it rose the dark landmass that was Kowloon , and beyond Kowloon lay China . Pei was amazed by all she could see . She swallowed the dull pain of wishing Lin were there with her . At a soft shuffling of footsteps behind her , she turned around . An old woman dressed in a servant 's dark tunic and trousers , carrying a bulging bag in each hand , walked slowly downhill toward Pei . She seemed to stare at her with disdain , mumbling under her breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " take our positions , " as the old woman quickened her steps down the hill . The botanical gardens were on Upper Albert Road . Ahead , Pei could already see a cluster of green among the concrete roads and houses . She began to walk more quickly , promising herself the cool shade of the trees once she had arrived . Song Lee had told her that the sisters would wait on the grass just to the right of the entrance . Near the gardens , Pei stopped and caught her breath . She liked sweet-voiced Song Lee and hoped for the best in dealing with the other sisters , but Pei remembered all too well the different personalities that had affected her life , first at the girls ' house , then at the silk factory and sisters ' house . Dealing with so many people was often like playing a game of chess . There were so many pieces , all moving in different directions . It was always wise to guard all sides against capture . The sisters were waiting right where Song Lee had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-and-white birds in their black trousers and white tunic tops , not unlike the clothing of the silk sisterhood . For a moment , Pei felt she could be back in Yung Kee . She took a deep breath and dusted off her own white trousers . " Ah , Pei , you 've found your way . " Song Lee ran over to meet her . " I hope you did n't have any trouble . " Pei smiled , a bead of sweat running down her forehead . " No , your directions made it easy . I just did n't realize how steep the hills are . " Song Lee laughed . " You 'll get used to them . You 'll have no choice , going up and down to the market and picking up the little ones from school . " She took Pei 's arm and led her back to a small group of women waiting by a shady boulevard , surrounded by flower beds . " Do n't worry , " Song Lee whispered , " they wo n't bite . " Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the names of two : Luling , who was roughly the same age as herself , and a younger-looking sister who preferred to be addressed by her newly adopted English name , Mary . The others greeted her , poured her tea from a thermos , and handed her rich-tasting almond cookies , whose flaky crumbs tickled her throat as she tried to answer all the sisters ' questions . That night , as Pei lay in her cot next to Ji Shen 's , she thought of what a different impression Lin would have made that afternoon . Although she was shy , Lin would have spoken eloquently , made them listen to her and recognize her gifts . But Pei felt as if all her words had been short and dry , falling to the ground like stones . Hong Kong is hot , big , crowded . Yes , I can cook , wash , dust . Pei shifted on the uncomfortable cot . She felt the slight ache of her strained leg muscles , and winced again at recalling Ji Shen 's excited , happy voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They wanted to know how we like it here in Hong Kong , " she answered wearily . " Have they found you a position yet ? " " I 've only just met them . " " When they do , will we live there ? " Pei forced herself up the stairs . " I do n't know , " she said , her voice barely audible . Two days later , Pei went downstairs to find a note from Song Lee waiting for her . She turned it over in her hands , as Ji Shen urged her to hurry and open it . When Pei finally did , she read : We have found you a good position in the Chen household . Be at the address below at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon . Use the back entrance . Song Lee Pei studied the address on Po Shan Road . She wondered if it was like one of the big brick and stucco houses she 'd passed on the way to the botanical gardens , whether it had many rooms with the same thick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a view of the harbor . She kept the note tucked safely in her pocket all day . For dinner , Pei and Ji Shen went to the nearby Star Village Restaurant to celebrate their good fortune . That night , Pei was too excited to sleep . Her heart raced . Their new life in Hong Kong would begin tomorrow . Pei inhaled the musty air , tried to find a comfortable position on the sagging cot , and then closed her eyes against all her fears .
