<p> Three Milwaukee-bound passengers on a stopover in Phoenix got an unpleasant surprise recently after slaking their thirst in the terminal cocktail lounge . Returning to the gate , they could only watch forlornly through the window as their plane taxied to the runway , having unceremoniously dumped their luggage in a baggage cart on the tarmac . <p> " We made the boarding announcement and even paged them , " said Scott Sorensen , an America West flight attendant who worked that flight . " In years past we might have waited , but we no longer delay flights to accommodate passengers who arrive late . " <p> Nor , all of a sudden , do most other airlines . In fact , if the airlines deliver on their recent promises  --  or possibly threats  --  not only will latecomers increasingly find the gates shut in their face , but so will passengers who arrive at what used to be considered on time . UAL 's United Airlines , for example , recently warned even passengers who book seats in advance to arrive at least 20 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The logic of the situation seems apparent . " If a flight waits around , " explained Bill Compton , a pilot who is executive vice president of operations for Trans World Airlines , " that plane will be late all day long , " inconveniencing passengers systemwide . <p> But why has it taken until now for airlines to get tough on stragglers ? The answer seems to be that at long last they can afford to . When they were losing more than $13 billion between 1990 and 1994 , they did not dare leave late-arriving travelers behind for fear of sacrificing precious revenue and good will . <p> Now that they are enjoying record profits ( $5.1 billion over the past two years ) , and are packing passengers in at the highest levels in half a century , the airlines have the luxury of teaching the laggards a lesson . And they are finding that being sticklers for punctuality is good for business . <p> " Until deregulation in 1978 , " T.W.A. 's Mr. Compton said , " about the only way we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were like public utilities . After deregulation , it took our industry more than a decade to become competitive . T.W.A. , along with everybody else , lost sight of the fact that people buy an airplane ticket to get where they 're going on time . " <p> Keeping more closely to departure and arrival schedules also saves money  --  lots of it  --  that would otherwise be spent mopping up after the mess of missed connections . Northwest Airlines , for example , calculates that late arrivals cost it about $36 million a year , roughly what it spends on advertising , in overtime pay and the expense of delivering mishandled luggage , feeding stranded passengers and booking them on rival airlines . <p> Similarly , before Continental Airlines improved its on-time record over the last two years  --  in part by offering monthly bonuses of up to $100 for every worker below senior management , for every month the carrier finished in first , second or third place  --  it figured its poor showing was costing it $6 million a month . Other airlines have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial toll of losing angry customers . <p> " It 's a disservice to passengers who spend a lot of money to fly when their airline does n't arrive on time , " said James E. Goodwin , United 's senior vice president for North America . <p> Improving on-time performance  --  defined by the Department of Transportation as the percentage of flights that arrive within 15 minutes of schedule  --  has become something of an obsession with airlines , which view high scores as a publicity bonanza . In fact , the industry 's ratings have actually been slipping throughout the decade  --  from a peak of 82.5 percent in 1991 to 74.5 percent in 1996 . But last year 's dismal showing resulted largely from the horrendous winter weather , and other uncontrollable forces have influenced the long-term decline , from increased airport traffic and fuller airplanes to the introduction of time-consuming security procedures at check-in counters . For the last two years , the figures have been further skewered by the Government 's decision to start counting mechanical delays in the total . <p> But the absolute numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and everybody is scrambling to stay ahead of the pack . Delta Air Lines , for example , has stopped making announcements at the start of boarding calling for passengers needing assistance . " Because almost everyone jumped up thinking the boarding process was under way , it led to confusion , " said Bell Berry , a Delta spokesman . " So we now identify passengers needing assistance as they arrive at the gate or check in , but still check them in first . " The new approach , he added , is designed to speed up boarding and get planes moving earlier . <p> T.W.A. recently stopped holding up flights for connecting passengers stuck on delayed flights , except in unusual circumstances , preferring to risk the wrath of the fewer connecting passengers than of the many more passengers who would be inconvenienced while awaiting the others ' arrival . And many airlines are looking at such time savers as electronic ticketing and what is called gate-reader technology , a system that automatically keeps track of who is on board and where they are seated  --  functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special disadvantages just have to fight harder to keep their ratings high . United , with 30 percent of its 2,200 daily departures from the oft-fogbound West Coast , concedes it has little hope of consistently capturing the No. 1 spot anytime soon . " But we believe we need to be in the top tier , " Mr. Goodwin said . " Our focus is to get into the top three or four . " In April , the last month for which figures are available , United finished third . <p> United now boards passengers five minutes earlier than in the past , Mr. Goodwin said . In addition , it has changed maintenance procedures to make them more efficient , has added more mechanics and has been working with the Federal Aviation Administration at Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport to make landing procedures more efficient through better spacing of arriving aircraft . <p> Several airlines are encouraging more collaboration among departments to shorten delays . At Continental , flight timetables no longer involve just the scheduling department , but seek information from pilots , baggage handlers , mechanics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down together and talk about the ripple effect of something so seemingly unimportant as reopening the door of a plane ready to taxi for takeoff . " Opening the door may take only 10 seconds , " said Jon Austin , a Northwest spokesman , " but then you may have to go through the safety check again . " <p> T.W.A. created a special on-time group of managers and employees from every sector of the company to propose ways of saving time . It came up with some 40 suggestions , and the carrier incorporated 12 of them . <p> For example , it now gives the captain discretion to fly faster to make up for lost time , despite higher fuel costs , or to fly more slowly , if early arrival would mean that gate , gate crew or baggage handlers were not available . Another innovation involves the distribution of an hourly count-down-to-departure checklist for all employees , from gate agents and cleaning crews to caterers and flight crews , showing the interrelationship of their tasks . <p> Those strategies appear to be paying off for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressively in recent months  --  to 83.8 percent in April , the latest month for which official statistics have been released , and to 88.2 percent in May , a figure that will be reported by the Department of Transportation in July , from 66.9 percent in May 1996 . Hoping to lift it even higher , T.W.A. has guaranteed 1,000 frequent-flier miles to passengers on any domestic flight arriving late through this month , on the assumption that the employees will bend over backward to keep the giveaway miles to a minimum . <p> Consistently high on-time performance can lift the morale of workers , who have fewer irate passengers to deal with and who get to enjoy a more ordered home life . " Our employees want to be able to know they 'll be home to their kids on time , " said Ned Walker , a spokesman for Continental , " and they ca n't know that if flights are always being delayed or canceled . " Continental 's bonuses for on-time performance averaged $525 for each employee in 1995 and almost $600 last year . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just line employees ' pockets , of course ; it has also played an important role in Continental 's turnaround . " Two and a half years ago we were pulling out our maps one more time , looking for the road to Wilmington , " the Delaware site of the United States Bankruptcy Court , Mr. Walker said , " and last year we had $1 billion in cash , and Smart Money named us as having the best business class . " <p> Last month , for the second consecutive year , J. D. Power &; Associates cited Continental as No. 1 in consumer satisfaction for domestic flights of 500 miles or more among frequent business travelers who average 25 round trips a year . ( America West won for flights under 500 miles . ) The most important factor in that evaluation , conducted with Frequent Flier magazine , was on-time performance . <p> Bragging rights for No. 1 for on-time performance has taken some unusual , occasionally fractious , occasionally humorous turns . Last year , for example , Continental said it would no longer consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader , or of America West or Alaska Airlines when deciding whether to award employee bonuses for finishing in the top three positions . The reason ? Those carriers lack the expensive automated system that register the exact moment that the plane 's front door is opened . The implication , as far as Continental is concerned , is that the three airlines ' manual reporting system presents an invitation for them to fudge their arrival-time figures . <p> All three defended the integrity of their reporting , and the Department of Transportation said it had no complaints . However , Northwest also refuses to compare its performance with Southwest 's because , according to Mr. Austin , Northwest 's spokesman , Southwest does not operate a hub-and-spoke system and thus it has the built-in advantage of not having to transfer luggage to connecting flights . <p> Five years ago , Southwest had a lot of fun at Northwest 's expense with television spots and newspaper ads mocking Northwest 's claim to be No. 1 in punctuality and ending with the gibe " Liar , liar , pants on fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could not resist taking a retaliatory potshot at Southwest and its feisty chairman , Herb Kelleher , with this bit of doggerel : " We serve Paris , the one in France/ We see Herb 's underpants .
