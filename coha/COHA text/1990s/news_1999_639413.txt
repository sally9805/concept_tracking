<p> It was early in the 1980s that The Denver Post stopped being a ' mom and pop ' operation - or more accurately a ' pop-and-sis ' operation - and entered into big-time newspapering . <p> Owned and operated by Frederick Bonfils and his daughter , Helen , for most of the century , the newspaper was sold to the Times-Mirror Corporation which promptly turned it over to a management team from Texas . <p> Their first big idea was to declare war again on ' the other paper . ' They did succeed in intensifying the hostilities , mostly by raiding their newsroom staff and spending lots of money covering the major events of the day . <p> It was at one of those events , on the Saturday morning before Super Bowl XVII , that the sports pages of The Denver Post also entered into the big-time . <p> There I was in a hotel room in Los Angeles in 1983 , getting ready to cover John Riggins and ' The Hogs ' vs . David Woodley and ' The Fish ' ( the Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was Edgar Kaiser Jr. , the new owner of the Denver Broncos , inviting me to come over to his suite at an exclusive Beverly Hills hotel for coffee . He said he wanted to talk about the future of the Broncos , so I jumped in a taxi . <p> A few sips into our coffee , Kaiser hit me with a staggering question that would eventually elevate sports in Denver to the highest of highs . ' Joe , he said , ' What do you think it would take for me to get John Elway . " <p> Considering how Kaiser had just low-balled a couple of all-pro linebackers , Randy Gradishar and Bob Swenson , I thought this was probably just big talk intended to get Kaiser some positive publicity in the paper . I said , ' I do n't know , but unless you 've got some extra first-round draft choices I do n't know about , it 's probably a lot more than you 've got to offer . ' <p> But Kaiser reminded me that he was a Stanford grad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore Colts had the first pick in the draft , that Elway had already indicated he would not play for Colts coach Frank Kush , and that he had become chummy with Robert Irsay , the Colts ' eccentric owner . <p> I wrote the story , telling readers not to count the Broncos out of the pre-draft Elway sweepstakes and four months later , on May 2 , 1983 , Kaiser delivered . <p> ' BRONCOS SIGN ELWAY , ' screamed the lede headline on the front page of The Post the next morning . <p> ' MAJOR EARTHQUAKE JOLTS CALIF. ' was the headline right below it . <p> After that , there would be no end to the Elway headlines and no end to the parade of big-time writers assigned to cover the Elway stories . Among them were Woodrow Paige Jr. , the outrageous humorist from ' the other paper , ' and Rick Reilly , the promising young prospect from the Boulder Camera , who would eventually become sports page superstars . <p> When word of the trade passed along press row at a Denver Nuggets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press conference , leaving a couple lonely sport writers to cover the game . <p> In Paige 's column the next morning , he described the trade as ' the biggest steal since The Great Train Robbery . ' <p> Wrote Paige : <p> With all the subtlety of a nuclear blast , the Denver Broncos dropped a bombshell Monday night . <p> Boom . <p> John Elway has exploded onto Colorado . <p> The shock waves may never subside and the fallout already is being felt throughout the National Football League . <p> Elway throws lethal bombs . <p> In the biggest steal since The Great Train Robbery , the Broncos got the fabulous young quarterback , who may earn in five years what was taken in the Brinks Robbery , from the Baltimore Colts for their No. 1 draft pick this year , offensive lineman Chris Hinton , a first-round draft choice in 1984 , and reserve quarterback Mark Herrmann . <p> Yes , that 's all the Broncos gave up . It was grand theft . <p> Colts owner Robert Irsay , in Denver Monday , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Broncos owner Edgar Kaiser probably should have thrown in some swampland in Florida and the Brooklyn Bridge into the deal . The trade was somewhat reminiscent of the time when the Boston Red Sox sent a young pitcher/outfielder named George Herman Ruth to the New York Yankees . <p> But the Yankees did n't get this Babe . Elway wo n't be another Ruth , but he has the potential to become another Joe Namath with good knees . <p> Irsay should be elected mayor of Denver . In one day , he has done more for this city than the other guy has in 14 years . <p> Paige was right on the money ( Elway signed for $ 5 million over four years , including a $ 1 million signing bonus ) , and he was right on the money with his predictions . <p> Elway did throw lethal although it did take a few years for him to get started . <p> It was n't until his fourth season , in fact , that Elway began making more big headlines , leading the Broncos into the NFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Elawy had the headlines screaming again after leading the Broncos to an incredible come-from-behind , overtime victory at Cleveland to get them back to the Super Bowl . <p> ' SIMPLY SUPER , ' screamed the headline over this reporter 's game story . <p> CLEVELAND - The road to Pasadena is approximately 981/2 yards long , and then some . <p> John Elway stepped it off for the Denver Broncos on the cold and muddy floor of hostile Cleveland Stadium Sunday , leading them along on an unbelievably intrepid trip to the Super Bowl . <p> In a game that undoubtedly elevated Elway to national superstar status , the young Denver quarterback rallied the Broncos to a 23-20 overtime victory over the Cleveland Browns for the American Football Conference championship , only the second in team history . <p> Rookie wide receiver Mark Jackson scored the tying touchdown on a five-yard pass from Elway with just 37 seconds left in regulation time . Veteran placekicker Rich Karlis kicked the winning 33-yard field goal with 9:12 in overtime . <p> For more heroes , run a finger all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that game that did , indeed , elevate Elway to national , even international , superstar status . <p> It was that game that also gave the sports pages of The Denver Post the quote of the decade : <p> ' We 've got them right where we want them ' was offensive lineman Keith Bishop 's unforgettable message to Elway and the rest of the Broncos when they huddled up at the 11/2 yard line to start ' The Drive ' after having fumbled a Cleveland kickoff . <p> With two more trips to the Super Bowl , Elway and the Broncos were clearly THE STORY of the ' 80s , but they were n't the only story . <p> Early in the decade , Denver had a brief fling with professional hockey before some guy from Buffalo sold the Colorado Rockies to some guy in New Jersey despite an embarrassing Denver Post ' save-the-Rockies ' campaign . <p> Shortly after Elway arrived , the Denver Nuggets , with an all-star lineup that included Kiki Vandeweghe , Dan Issel and Alex English , made a couple of brief appearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game in NBA history - a 186-184 triple-overtime loss to the Detroit Pistons with Vandeweghe scoring 51 and English adding 47 to tie Detroit 's Isiah Thomas for second-leading scorer honors . <p> Neither of those franchises entertained Post readers like the new game in town , however - the Denver Gold of the United States Football League . The USFL was a spunky spring league that might have worked if some of its greedier owners had n't decided to try to take on the NFL in the fall and in court . <p> But it was fun while it lasted , especially when Red Miller , the former Broncos coach who was fired by Kaiser in 1981 , got mad at his new owner , Ron Blanding , slammed him up against some lockers at the schoolhouse headquarters and got himself fired again . <p> Miller was replaced by his old quarterback , Craig Morton a story broke by the same reporter who broke the original **47;1466;TOOLONG story , by the way . And who could ever forget the colorful Mouse Davis who introduced the run-and-shoot offense to pro football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the NFL . <p> Buying and selling professional sports teams was big business and big news in Denver in the ' 80s . The Broncos and the Nuggets got sold twice , while the Rockies and the Gold hung around just long enough to experience one ownership change apiece .
