Dear Dr. Cory : My father is a paramedic with the Baltimore County Fire Department . He got a new stethoscope and he gave me his old one . I am really interested in medicine and I want to be a doctor . My heart sounds like lub-dub , lub-dub . One of my friends has a heart murmur . She let me listen to her heart . It sort of goes lub-fa-dub , lub-fa-dub . What causes that ? My friend is very thin and her heart sounds louder than mine . Marybeth Reynolds Edgewood , Maryland Dear Marybeth : A murmur is a noise that doctors or nurses hear between the " lub " and " dub " sounds of the heartbeat . One type of murmur , called an innocent murmur , is caused by the normal noise of the blood flowing through the heart . Innocent murmurs are often difficult to hear . They are very common in preschool and school-age children . Children with innocent heart murmurs lead normal lives.They do not have to restrict their activity . These kind of murmurs do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away on their own as a child gets older . Heart doctors , or cardiologists , do n't know why they start or why they go away . Your friend 's heartbeat probably does sound louder to you than your own . Listening to a heartbeat through a stethoscope is a lot like listening to water flowing through a garden hose.The thinner the hose , the louder the noise . Because your friend is thin , she has less body tissue for the heart sounds to travel through.This is most likely why her heartbeat sounds louder to you . // We 're glad to hear about your interest in medicine . It is n't too early to start reading all you can about biology , chemistry , and anatomy . Dear Dr. Cory : Whenever I take a bath or a shower , I see wrinkles on the bottoms of my feet and the insides of my hands.Why is that ? Olivia Mae Clinton Mentor , Ohio Dear Olivia Mae : The tiny oil glands in your skin make an oily liquid called sebum . Sebum helps to keep your skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that help protect skin from germs . When you take a bath , soap and minerals in the water wash off this oil . Once the oil is gone , your skin is no longer waterproof . Water seeps into your epidermis , the top layer of your skin.This causes the skin to swell and wrinkle . The palms of your hands and the soles of your feet will wrinkle first.That 's because they have less oil , or sebum , than the rest of your body . The wrinkles will go away once you get out of the bath or pool.Your body will absorb the water and continue making oil , restoring the skin 's waterproof protection . Dear Dr. Cory : My teacher learned at her school that blood is blue or purple before it picks up oxygen . My dad said it is n't . Who is right ? Thank you for your help ! Sylvia King // Paradise , Pennsylvania Dear Sylvia : Technically , your dad is right . Blood contains the substance hemoglobin . Hemoglobin contains iron . Iron is what gives the blood its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in oxygen , the hemoglobin is a purplishred color . When blood is full of oxygen , the hemoglobin is bright red . Our bodies have two major types of blood vessels , or tubes , that carry the blood through the body . One type , called an artery , carries blood from the lungs and heart.This blood has lots of oxygen in it , so it is bright red.The other type of blood vessel , called a vein , carries blood back to the lungs and heart.This blood has very little oxygen in it , so it is more purplish-red . As it travels through the lungs again , it picks up oxygen and regains its bright red color .
