CONVINCED THAT MY SLANT on Bohr 's version of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics was our last hope , I bullied Jane , who did n't want to be married to me anymore , and Sacha into cooperating with a final desperate attempt to save the world . <p> " This is stupid , Tim , " lane said , her voice softened a little by the brown paper bag over her head . <p> " La la , la la , la la , " Sacha sang . She banged the heels of her shoes against the legs of her chair in time to her tune . Wearing a bag over her head was still fun , I thought , but our daughter was seven and had fidgeting down to a fine art . How long would she stick with me ? <p> I 'd pushed away my plate , but there was a sticky spot , orange marmalade probably , where I would have liked to put my hands . I put them in my lap instead . Breakfast had been tense . Jane had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some toast , warmed some bacon . I wished I 'd brushed my teeth before I put a bag over my own head . <p> Everything was tan , but not an even tan , I imagined it was like looking through the dry , mottled skin of some desert creature , maybe a horned toad . There was a seam where the brown paper overlapped and joined to make a bag , and I could n't see much light through that double layer . If I tilted my head back carefully , I could see what looked like the letter H in some fancy font ( except for the way the seam came up and touched the cross piece of the H ) made from the overlaps needed to square off and seal the bottom of the bag . <p> " I do n't think I could have missed the fact that a comet is about to hit the Earth , Tim , " Jane said . <p> " Do you read the newspapers ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Do you watch TV ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How about the radio ? " <p> " Well , no . Not today . " <p> " None of your goofy friends do either . " I nailed down my point . " So just how do you think you would have heard about it ? " <p> " That tone is exactly why I say we need to live apart , Tim . " <p> " Boop boop boop be doop , " Sachs sang . <p> " Everyone just relax , " I said . " And keep your bags on . " Things were slipping away . I needed to circle our wagons . It was vital that none of us give the world outside even a fleeting glance . <p> My own breath aside , the smell inside my bag reminded me of all the things you can carry in a brown paper bag . Curiously , the first thing that came to mind was books . Surely , I 'd carried home more groceries in brown paper bags than books . In fact the name of the grocery store was printed right on the bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and clothes , and moving . I thought of garbage in the bags before I thought of groceries . Maybe it was because groceries spend so little time in the bags . I knew that if I packed my stuff up in paper bags , the bags might just sit for months in some cold new place . <p> " This is n't just my plan , Jane , " I said . " The president has been on TV urging people not to look . Forests have been lighted to smoke up the skies . Teams are everywhere in primitive areas making sure no one looks . " <p> " Even if there is a giant comet about to hit the Earth , just what good do you expect these bags to do ? " Jane asked . <p> " Things that might happen ca n't be separated from the devices you use to measure them , " I said . " You ca n't look at something without changing it . " <p> " What ? " <p> " The moon 's not there if no one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Like the tree in the forest ? " <p> " Sort of , " I said . " But that was philosophy . This is science . " <p> " Oh , right . Sure . " <p> " I have to go to the bathroom , " Sacha said . <p> " Soon , Honey , " I said . " Just hang on a little while longer . " <p> " Someone would peek , " Jane said . <p> " Maybe . But it wo n't be us . " <p> " How can that matter ? " <p> " This is the same argument you use for not voting , Jane . " I knew I should be soothing her instead of snapping at her , but I could n't help it . " It 's irresponsible . If everyone thought like you , no one would vote . " <p> " Who 's talking about voting ? We 're sitting around the kitchen table with grocery sacks over our heads ! " <p> Sacha giggled . <p> I decided to try silence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides of the bag , and with any little movement there was a rustle like dry autumn leaves in a green plastic trash sack . I could hear birds , too . They would be in the feeder outside the window over the sink . They would fly away if they caught us looking at them . I could pull the bag away from my face a little and look straight down and see my white shirt over the gut hanging into my lap . I could suck the gut in ; I could sigh it out . I could see my tan slacks , my black loafers , and the black and white kitchen tiles . <p> Strange , but I could n't see the name of our grocery store through the bag . Had I put the bag on backwards ? I twisted it around . I still could n't see the letters , and then I did n't know which way the bag was . Were the red letters to the front or to the back ? I felt unhooked , disoriented , lost . <p> Things suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comet touched the atmosphere , and because it did n't hit just then , I think the last person on Earth quit looking at it at precisely that moment . <p> " Do n't you see the sudden light of the fire ? " <p> " A cloud probably just moved away from the sun , " Jane said . <p> I thought I heard some uncertainty in her voice . " That 's what you 'd like to think , " I said . <p> " How long are we going to play this game , Tim ? " <p> How long ? Why , just until the comet 's gone , I almost said . It hit me then that Jane 's question was a good one . If finally no one was looking at the comet , did that mean it went away , or did it mean the comet was hanging frozen just inside the atmosphere , filling the entire sky , ready to plunge down on us as soon as we looked ? Did n't that mean we could never look ? Did n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table with bags over our heads forever ? <p> " It makes no sense , " Jane said . " What about intelligences on other planets ? What if some alien shaman is looking at your comet through a telescope ? " <p> " One of your saucer people ? " <p> " At least there 's good evidence for them . Unlike your stupid comet . " <p> " Jane , " I said , " if you looked out the window right now you 'd see the sky filled with fire , and just because you looked , the comet would crash down and blow us all up . " <p> " You 're scaring me , Daddy , " Sacha said . <p> " Do n't worry , Honey . " I would have liked to touch her hand , but I could n't reach her . " Nothing can hurt you if you keep your head in the bag . " <p> " You 're teaching her to be an ostrich ! " <p> " What 's an ostrich ? " Sacha asked . <p> " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . <p> " Yes . " <p> " I really , really have to go , Daddy , " Sacha said . <p> I heard them shifting in their chairs , moving around , trying to be quiet , but not succeeding . I heard them whispering . Fear turned me to stone . The game was up . I pictured Jane quietly slipping off her bag and setting it aside , pictured her carefully removing Sacha 's bag , saw Jane grin and roll her eyes in my direction and put her finger to her lips so Sacha would be quiet , saw them both looking at me stiff in my bag , the two of them , the little alien , the Russian girl , our surprising blond Sacha , and the big one , looking so sweetly sad suddenly , Jane . It was n't that she hated me , I realized . She 'd moved on when I was n't looking . She was bored , restless ; we had so little in common these days . She wandered like a wounded bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I plodded ever westward . What in the world did we have to talk about ? <p> I saw Sacha make an O of her mouth when she looked at the window and saw the comet peeking in at us like an angry red eye filling the sky . I saw the comet leap to Earth and fire the trees , the city , our house . Burning hurricane winds knocked down our walls and crisped our skin and peeled our bones . <p> I cried out . <p> Jane snatched the bag from my head . <p> Sunshine turned the refrigerator into a gleaming white block , an alien monolith that had popped into existence among our chrome pots and wooden bowls . From somewhere far away came the tiny tinkle tinkle of an ice-cream truck . I looked at the window over the sink , and , in a flutter of squawks and black wings , birds fled the feeder . <p> " It 's easy to see what happened , " I said . " You were right , Jane . Someone peeked . But we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we looked , we 'd split off into a reality in which the comet never existed in the first place . We 're saved ! " <p> " Oh , Daddy . " Sacha hugged me quickly , then ran off to the bathroom . <p> " Okay , " Jane said , " you can have every other weekend . But we take the cat . " <p> " What cat ?
