<p> Colin Cook believes gays can be changed to straights . <p> Cook , a former Seventh-day Adventist minister who says he himself has overcome homosexuality , has counseled gay men for years despite having been disciplined twice by his church for inappropriate sexual activity . <p> He was removed from the ministry in 1974 after he was discovered having sex with a man in the church where Cook preached . In 1986 , his Quest Learning Center in Reading , Pa. , a " change ministry , " came crashing down with his admissions he 'd had sexual encounters with several counselees who had come to him for help in changing their homosexual orientation . <p> Now Cook is in Colorado , again counseling gay men to change their orientation , and , according to two recent clients , again practicing inappropriate sexual behavior as part of that counseling . <p> Cook has been endorsed by Colorado for Family Values of Colorado Springs and spoke at several of their " Time to Stand Seminars " in Colorado last summer . Cook has continued speaking at his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springs and continues into tomorrow . <p> Cook says he has n't been involved in any homosexual activities since 1986 . <p> But two young men counseled by Cook in the past two years told The Denver Post that he had hours of " phone sex " with them instead of counseling them to become heterosexuals . <p> The Post interviewed seven other men counseled by Cook in the 1980s and the mothers of two others , all of whom reported inappropriate sexual behavior by Cook in counseling sessions . The Post also listened to hours of tape recordings one man made of Cook 's phone counseling sessions . <p> Tape after tape from Eddy ( not his real name ) and story after story from the other men show a pattern of counseling sessions filled with discussions of sex . Phone counselees reported Cook described his own body and asked the client to do the same , gave advice on how to masturbate for more enjoyment , had prolonged discussions about genitalia and discussions about each other 's sexual liaisons , current and past . <p> " He 's emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 30s who had phone counseling sessions with Cook in 1993 . " He thinks if he 's having erotic phone conversations it 's OK because he 's not having sex . " <p> David , who had " three or four " phone counseling sessions with Cook said he ended the sessions after another therapist he was seeing told him Cook 's conversations were totally inappropriate for a counselor . <p> Men who met in person with Cook reported similar discussions in addition to mutual masturbation , removal of clothes , naked and near naked full-body massages and " grinding " hugs that lasted for several minutes . <p> Kevin Tebedo , director of Colorado for Family Values , stoutly defended Cook , saying " we believe Colin 's message is valuable and the response to Colin ( at last summer 's seminars ) has been tremendous . All the people thought he was top-notch . " <p> Colorado for Family Values is the conservative Christian organization based in Colorado Springs that backed Amendment 2 , which sought to bar local laws offering anti-discrimination protection for gays . The law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tebedo , the group 's spokesman , said he knew about Colin 's past . " He 's very open about that . We have every confidence in him . I do n't know the intricacies of counseling . I just know the homosexual lobby is trying to rip open Colin . " <p> Cook 's views are disputed by those who argue that scientific evidence is mounting that the sexual orientation of many gay people is rooted in genetic and biological factors determined before birth and therefore can not be changed by counseling . <p> Rick Cendo , a local gay activist , has protested Cook 's Colorado appearances and in May wrote to Colorado for Family Values criticizing the group 's support of Cook . <p> In a stinging reply , Tebedo wrote back that Cook " has been totally free of homosexual activity " after undergoing " rigorous counseling . He has been set free ; Colin is a changed man " by the love of Christ . <p> " CFV has chosen to stand with Colin I want the entire state to hear him , " Tebedo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group Focus on the Family , a multimillion-dollar information clearinghouse for families and groups that largely agree on a philosophy of " Christian values . " It produces magazines , books , videos and radio programs that are circulated worldwide . <p> An article in the August 1995 Colorado Christian News said that Cook 's FaithQuest Colorado Inc. , " shares its expertise through leaders like the counseling department at Focus on the Family , Colorado for Family Values and church and seminary leaders . " <p> But a Focus on the Family official said the organization has no connection with Cook or FaithQuest and has never endorsed him . <p> Cook was a speaker this year at a meeting of the Christian Counselors of Colorado Springs , which sometimes meets on the Focus campus , said Paul Hetrick , a Focus vice president . " But that does n't mean we endorse him . " <p> Cook declined to discuss his " counseling techniques " with The Post . <p> The Post read to Cook parts of the transcribed tapes of explicit sex discussions with Eddy . His response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other counselors say any kind of sexual contact between counselors and counselees is inappropriate . <p> " Sex is sex , " said Dr. Marjorie Leidig , a Boulder psychiatrist . " It does n't matter if it 's in person or on the phone . Therapists are n't to have a dual relationship with patients . You ca n't be counseling someone and screwing them at the same time . " <p> Cook has no credentials in counseling and makes no claims to be a psychiatrist , psychologist , pastoral counselor or licensed social worker . His brochures say he is " Colin Cook , MA , " and lists the number of years he has counseled . <p> Colorado does not require counselors to have licenses . <p> An independent operator such as Cook is n't bound to " follow the generally accepted guidelines if he does n't belong to a professional organization , " said Dr. Tom Roessler , staff psychologist at National Jewish Hospital . Therapists who belong to professional organizations would be removed from the organization for inappropriate behavior , he said . <p> A director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ron Highley , said any counselor who has sexual contact with counselees " is totally unprofessional . It is a gross abuse of his position . " <p> None of those who say they were inappropriately treated by Cook ever went to law enforcement authorities and The Denver Post has n't found any record of arrests or charges against him . Most said they did n't report Cook because they were embarrassed about their homosexuality , about being " taken in " by Cook and because of their conservative religious backgrounds . <p> Craig Scott , a client from Cook 's Reading , Pa. , days , filed a written report with the Pennsylvania attorney general in 1990 , but officials in that office did not take any action , saying it was a church issue and the state did n't want to get involved , Scott said . <p> Scott was part of a lawsuit filed against Cook in June 1988 in Berks County , Pa. , on behalf of six men who had been Cook clients in Reading , but it was never pursued , partly because of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inactivity " in 1991 , according to court records . <p> In the lawsuit , all of the men said Cook wanted to hear about their sexual fantasies or were asked to masturbate in front of Cook . In each case Cook told the men the activities were to help them " feel comfortable with their bodies in the sight of God , " and as a way of " desensitizing " the men . <p> Some men said they were taken in by Cook 's attention , his seductive voice and sharp intelligence and felt relieved they had finally found someone with whom they could discuss their homosexual feelings . <p> The effects of the sessions with Cook last to this day , said John Eric Kulp , who now lives in Winston-Salem , N.C. " I have a lot of anger about this . I ca n't trust anybody . " <p> Cook 's troubles became public in 1974 when he was kicked out of the Seventh-day Adventist ministry for allegedly having sex with a man in the church where he was pastor in New York . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change his sexual orientation . He later married and , having convinced the Adventist Church he was a heterosexual , set up theQuest Learning Center in Reading in 1979 . He also founded Homosexuals Anonymous , which at one time claimed more than 60 chapters in the U.S. and Canada . <p> But the Quest ministry collapsed after details of Cook 's activities were told in a research paper written by Ron Lawson , sociology professor at Queens ' College in New York City . <p> Cook continued private counseling after a six-month leave , he said , and in 1993 moved to Colorado . He founded FaithQuest Colorado Inc. , and began doing " Lifting the Fog " seminars on changing orientation as well as private counseling . <p> Most counselees past and present learned about Cook through church magazines , from ministers , parents or from hearing Cook speak in their churches . Cook was also on a church television program and twice appeared on the " Phil Donahue " show , along with other reparative therapists . <p> " Everyone in the church knew Colin was the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former client Scott . FaithQuest was the only sex-orientation change ministry funded by a denomination . <p> The mother of one former client who has AIDS said she sent her son to Cook on the advice of church leaders . Her son came home and reported Cook had " made a pass " at him . <p> " I bought his line , " Glenda said in a recent interview with The Denver Post . " Cook seemed like a nice person , very disarming , and seemed to have great Christian faith . " <p> Her son never elaborated on the Cook sessions . " It 's not the kind of thing a son and mum talk about , " she said . <p> Still an Adventist , Glenda is " angry " at her church , because officials never made it clear to the membership the extent of Cook 's behavior in Reading . " I still hear his name among church people and his books are still for sale . " <p> A national Adventist official said this week the church has no connection with Cook . Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClure confirmed that the church had twice ended its relationship with Cook . <p> But Cook has his supporters among clients . <p> Five of Cook 's current clients said Cook had helped them and never acted or talked inappropriately in counseling sessions . One man said he feels totally free from homosexuality now , but he knows that men often fail as they try to change orientation . " Failure is part of recovery , " said David Abood , of Manchester , N. H. <p> " One of Colin 's main points is to show us how to explore our bodies with God 's presence so we have a healthy view of sex , " said another . <p> But former clients from the 1980s say remembering Cook 's counseling is still painful . <p> " There was never any feeling Colin wanted me to change ( orientation ) but only that he wanted to have sex with me , " said Kulp . <p> Kulp is still angry over what happened to him . " It 's like your Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor giving you a drink . "
