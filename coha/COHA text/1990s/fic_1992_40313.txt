DADDY 'S LITTLE GIRLS <p> Five of them , sisters , juicy as figs - plump to nearly bursting through their clean clear skins . Griselda , the eldest , with dark filbert eyes that watched , watched everything , so sagacious before their time . Gardenia , the second , as pink and blonde as her sister was brown and bronze , with a smile that darkened as she grew more delectable , and then went black . The third girl was Geneva , named for a lake and a town . Sulky , sultry Geneva , with a beauty as exotic as her name , ripening deliciously as she advanced toward her teens . The other two : practically babies . Twins . Fraternal . Sororal . Georgina and Grippina . Sisters in the womb , in bed , the little twin bed they shared in the dark back room where sunlight slatted against the wall through a louvered blind . Mere children still , succulent with baby fat , streaks of blonde like marbling in their char-brown hair , like mottled sunlight , darkening as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush , children , do n't tell mom , it 's our little secret . Yours and Griselda 's and Gardenia 's and Gardenia 's and Geneva 's and mine . <p> How did it begin ? Not with the eldest . Gardenia was the first . Gardenia , home from school - was it first or second grade ? - ill with measles , or perhaps it was the flu , day after day on the daybed in the family room , her compact little body like a Brazil nut , so small beneath the sheet . Gardenia , with her plump arms reaching out to daddy , for comfort , for a hug . Hugsies , she called it . " Daddy , Hugsies . " Wanting to be tucked in , tended to , waiting to feel her daddy 's big broad hand at her sides , on her legs . Gardenia , hot , feverish , moaning , squirming side to side , canopied by the smell of her unwashed hair . <p> Lie still , Gardenia , lie still , my little girl , and daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just you and daddy , together on your bed . <p> Afterwards changing the sheet , mom laughing . " You never changed a sheet in your life . " Explaining : they looked so sweaty and wrinkled . Folding them to hid the stains . Thinking : if she asks I 'll tell her , and then I 'll never have to do it again . <p> She did n't ask . <p> To the doctor ! No . Gardenia 's getting better . Tomorrow as good as new . Take her to the doctor ? Daddy will take her , he 'll take her . Thinking : why is n't mom enough ? Wanting to stop , needing to stop , to throw light into the terrifying darkness , wanting not to want . You are the fruit and I am the seed and the rind . There is nothing lower than my body prone against your bed . Lying in black togetherness . Love and hate , fear and invincibility , good and evil , pleasure and pain . <p> Get Gardenia out of bed ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each looking so wise and yet so frightened beneath her minute brows . I do n't want to hurt you , tell me if I 'm hurting you , but be sure that you tell me and not your mom . Mom , who takes children to the doctor , wise little brown and blonde children , obedient little children who know enough not to talk about their dad . ( Daddy will punish you if you do n't obey . ) Mom , who does n't know enough to ask . Mom , who is no longer enough at all . <p> Hello . Yes , this is Russell Krugh . Trouble at school ? No , I ca n't understand it . They 're never any trouble at home . ( They 're seldom here . They come home late . They never bring friends . They 're afraid to go to their rooms . ) Thank you for telling me . Yes , I 'll take care of it . I can make my girls behave . <p> Six eyes , round as cherries . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad wolf , the wicked witch , the ogre . I 'm going to eat you up . " Please , daddy , no . " Devouring children like cashews . Thirsting for their tears . I ca n't stop , you ca n't stop me , no one can make me stop . Young eyes , so sad , accusing , feeding daddy 's fear and shame . Do n't look like that , young ladies . You 'll get your daddy angry . You know what happens when you get your daddy mad . How much do they know at school ? How much have they told ? <p> Mom has good news for the family . Another baby is on the way . Mom , who is no longer enough . Her belly like a cantaloupe , she is pushing daddy away . " Go sleep somewhere else tonight . Be quiet . Do n't wake up the girls . " <p> Hush , hush , Geneva , Gardenia , Griselda , little sugarplum fairies , hush , hush , my sweet little girls . Do n't wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls ask such strange questions ! Why some people are bigger . Why boys are stronger . Why fairy tales are cruel . Why houses do n't have locks on the inside . But they never ask where babies come from . I 'm pregnant . Their mom is pregnant . Why do n't they want to know ? " <p> Praying : Dear God , let it be a boy . <p> It was not a girl . It was two . <p> Bringing them home from the hospital . Trying not to hold them , not to touch the cotton-soft skin , not to smell the newborn scent . Trying to avoid the dim back room , the bassinets , so small next to a man . Mom complaining . " There are two of them . I ca n't do everything . I ca n't feed , burp , bathe , and diaper both at once . " Adding : " Griselda wants me to send them away to be adopted . What a strange child she 's become ! " It 's rivalry , sibling rivalry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newborns , infants , toddlers , healthy children , healthy bodies , all intact . Legs , fingers , toes , ears , noses . Bellies round as potatoes , little nipples like eyelets , so dark and still so flat . Daddy is your teacher . You must learn to be a woman someday . <p> " Daddy , stop ! They 're nearly babies ! " I ca n't , Gardenia , I ca n't . They 're mine ! Wanting to be stopped , but not found out . Twin impulses . Twin desires . <p> Twins . <p> Grippina , so tiny , like a fat blanched almond , lying like a wounded soldier on a spot on the sheet . Not crying like the others . Brave girl , brave girl . Your daddy 's proud . Like a whole bag of almonds rolling down from her oval eyes . Green eyes , turning brown . He loves you , Grippina . Daddy loves you , Grippina . Lying so still beside Georgina on the speckled sheet . Watching , like Griselda , with wide almond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . <p> A rash on Georgina 's mouth ? She must have scraped herself on something . Bloodstains on the linens ? They must have hurt themselves playing , in the yard , on a swing , on a stair . No wounds ? They heal quickly , young ones do . Invisible wounds , invisible scars . It happens sooner or later . Better to get it over with now . <p> Let daddy kiss it and make it better . Sh , sh , make no sound . That 's daddy 's little girl . You make your daddy proud . <p> " Geneva needs a head doctor . She 's brooding , depressed . She flies into rages over nothing . And she cries all the time . " Geneva 's head is find . " And Griselda ! Griselda 's running wild . She has the worst reputation in town . She 's never home nights . I ca n't control her . I think she 's out with boys . " I 've missed my little Griselda . In her room , over the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for daddy now . <p> It 's in magazines and newspapers , it 's even on TV . Children and strangers . It 's better with their dads . Daddy can teach them , daddy can help them . No one ever needs to know . It 's our little secret . It 's better that they get it over with now , that they learn it from someone they know . The loathing , the shame ! <p> No doctors ! " There 's something wrong with Grippina . " <p> Grippina . <p> It was Grippina was told . Fifth of five by five minutes . And she was only five years old . " No , mommy , no ! Do n't leave me alone with the big man ! " <p> " It 's only the doctor , Grippina . He 's going to help you . " <p> " Do n't let him touch me ! No ! " <p> Diagnosis : This child has been abused . <p> Incensed , mom and daddy .

" They 're mine ! <p> " Who has been doing this to them ? " <p> Mom Knows ! " I 'll make sure you never see your kids again . " <p> Never to see them again . Never to hold their fruitful bodies , never to kiss their chubby fingers , pink fat cheeks , or brooding eyes . Never to see them grow and develop , thick waists slimming , thin chests swelling , hips and thighs . <p> Mom says : " How could you do this to your children ? How could you be so vile ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're his onliest little diddle-ums . His iddy snooky-ookums . His babies . His berries . His brides . <p> Mom says : " You 're sick .

Let me kiss them away . " No , daddy , no ! " <p> The neighbors : " Did you hear about Russell Krugh ? He was just like all of us , with his station wagon and his lawnmower and his barbecue . Five girls ! All of them ? One at a time . My God ! He drove the Girl Scouts to summer camp ! My God ! He coached the girls ' softball team !

Take the girls , take the girls . <p> Goodbye , goodbye , sweet children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the garage , each painted with strips of sunlight , brunette and blonde . The Krugh girls , growing up and away from him , fleeing into their teens . Have n't taken care of you , watched over you , night after night ? <p> Nights gone by without them , dreaming about them in the dark , pale faces glowing , growing older , catching up with their eyes . Hushed nights along in the darkness , black rage swelling , empty arms cleaving the air for the pressure of daddy 's little girls . " You 'll never see them again . " ( NO ! ) They 'll never know their daddy loved them . " You 're sick . You 're an animal . " ( NO ! ) They 'll forget everything but that , the terrible secret .

Who will teach them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gardenia tried to understand him . Gentle , blossoming Gardenia , his soft-petaled flower . The first , but not the eldest . The one with the oldest scar . Only she still tried to see him , occasionally . In a public place . " I know you could n't help it , daddy . But why , daddy ? Why ? " <p> I 'm still your dad . No matter what your daddy did . " Yes . You 're still our dad . " <p> You 're mine ! <p> Watching the neighbors ' children , looking through them like a prism for daddy 's little girls . Seeing the nose or the cheekbones of one of his girls beneath the strangers ' eyes . Trying not to touch the skin of his daughters on a stranger 's little hand . They 're not my girls . <p> Waiting alone , for nothing , wanting nothing to be enough .

It 's better with their dads . <p> Hello , little girl . What 's your daddy like at home ? Does he keep you like a secret ? Are you afraid of going home ? I 'm your next-door neighbor . I raised five little girls like you . Just like you , with older eyes . <p> " Do n't your children have a right to be protected ? " Mom says : " Do n't worry . He 'll never see them again .

In the park , on the playground , their little limbs pumping , their fine soft hair flaying the sun . ( Griselda : " I hate you , daddy . " Gardenia : " Yes , you 're still our dad .

No matter how much I plead with you , keep them all away . Daddy 's girls . Five . <p> Hello , little girl . Would you like some candy ? Can I offer you a ride ? <p> Little girls , short , stunted fruit trees , shadowed dimples , darkness looming from lost-tooth smiles .
