<p> The consultants who oversaw installation of baggage systems at Denver International Airport indulged in Christmas candy and then billed it to the city . <p> They rented furnished apartments at the upscale Breakers complex for up to $ 1,700 per person , per month . They stayed at the Four Seasons Clift Hotel in San Francisco at $ 275 a night . A $ 1,400 airline ticket was n't a problem for them ; the city paid for it . <p> They availed themselves of valet laundry service , rental cars and gasoline . On the night before DIA opened last February , six of the consultants treated themselves to a $ 260 meal at Landry 's Seafood House restaurant in Englewood . The city picked up the tab . <p> Denver financial inspectors labeled the pattern of spending as " out of control , " but that has n't prevented O'Brien-Kreitzberg and Associates from cashing in on a $ 5.8 million contract . <p> Ten months of receipts and invoices submitted by O'Brien-Kreitzberg to the city show a pattern of lavish spending on hotels and apartments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt during construction and enough sympathetic ears from Mayor Wellington Webb 's staff to keep the city 's wallet open . <p> O'Brien-Kreitzberg 's expense receipts , from September 1994 to June 1995 , were reviewed and copied by The Denver Post . <p> Spending by DIA 's chief baggage-system consultant was a source of frustration for contract administrators who wrestled with whether to approve the expenses or bounce them back to the firm . But even if a bill was rejected , O'Brien-Kreitzberg would resubmit it in a different invoice . <p> " We went round and round over these expenses , because they were out of control , " one city inspector told The Post last week . " They were going haywire with the expenses . Their wives were coming with them , and they were taking trips to Vail . We finally had to put the kibosh on that . " <p> O'Brien-Kreitzberg is n't the only airport contractor whose spending habits have been scrutinized , but it is the one that city administrators cite the most difficulty with reeling in . <p> During the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Works Director Mike Musgrave . Musgrave left the city June 30 to go to work for O'Brien-Kreitzberg . <p> Among the more curious bills submitted to the city for payment were those of an O'Brien-Kreitzberg executive who twice stayed at luxury hotels in Pebble Beach , Calif . Gene Cochrane , head of O'Brien-Kreitzberg 's airport staff , charged the city for his January and March expenses at the golf resort . <p> Those bills are pending approval from the airport 's contract office . <p> Last week , Cochrane said he does n't expect the city to pick up the cost of his Pebble Beach excursions . <p> " If something got submitted to the city in connection with that , that would have been a mistake on my part , " he said . " But I just ca n't imagine that would have happened , frankly . If it did , I screwed up . " <p> Musgrave joined Cochrane to play golf in Pebble Beach in March but did n't bill the city for his expenses . He left his city job three months later for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in part , the subject of Denver grand jury and federal investigations , say sources who have testified . <p> Cochrane said he was interviewed by U.S. and Denver investigators but was told not to discuss the issues . <p> Asked if he had been interviewed as part of a Denver grand jury investigation , Cochrane said : " I need to skate out from under that question . Sitting here at this moment , I ca n't recall what I was asked to say or not say , and I think under the circumstances I just need to say I really ca n't say . <p> " But I can say unequivocally that there are not any ongoing issues that I 'm aware of , at all . We 're not talking about something that 's a matter of a few months old . " <p> O'Brien-Kreitzberg was the city 's engineering consultant on the airport 's automated and alternate baggage systems . The firm represented the city in negotiations with the airlines and in meetings with New York bond-rating firms . <p> Among the routine items on O'Brien-Kreitzberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $ 1,700 a month each , and airline travel that cost the city thousands more per month . <p> Cochrane , in addition to his $ 150 hourly billing , received travel and expense reimbursements as high as $ 8,000 per month . Other employees received similar payments . <p> In addition to the receipts , The Post reviewed internal city memos . They revealed how the city 's airport contract office fought with the New York-based firm to bring its fringe-benefit expenses under control . City staffers admonished O'Brien-Kreitzberg for paying its temporary employees higher hourly rates than its city contract allowed . <p> In a March 6 memo to Musgrave , Norm Witteveen , deputy director of aviation , detailed problems with O'Brien-Kreitzberg . They included : <p> Frequent out-of-state trips by the firm 's employees were charged to the city . Witteveen and other city officials say such trips should have been restricted by the city or paid for by O'Brien-Kreitzberg . <p> O'Brien-Kreitzberg rented five apartments for its employees at the luxurious Breakers . The city was left with lodging bills that came to as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the city exceeded amounts authorized in O'Brien-Kreitzberg 's contract . Pay for temporary clerks and typists was authorized at $ 14 an hour , but O'Brien-Kreitzberg was billing the city $ 30 an hour for those employees . <p> Overtime paid to subconsultants hired by O'Brien-Kreitzberg was n't authorized in its city contract . Musgrave eventually took it upon himself to approve overtime payments at 1 1/2 times the hourly rate . <p> With the apartments , the rental cars , gasoline costs and taxi fares , Witteveen said , the city was billed $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 a month for each consultant . <p> " This may be justified in short-term contracts , " Witteveen wrote to Musgrave , " but not on contracts that span more than one year . " The interoffice notes also detail how amendments to O'Brien-Kreitzberg 's contracts were drafted to cover added perks and were reworded to withstand scrutiny of outside auditors . <p> In one note , DIA contract administration supervisor Cheryl Tilkens told chief airport engineer Ginger Evans about difficulties she was having paying the expenses of O'Brien-Kreitzberg and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the expenses because of the wording in both O'Brien 's and Greiner/MKE 's contracts , " said Tilkens . " It would be best to correct the wording in both contracts so we do n't have auditors questioning why we did or did n't do something . " <p> Oftentimes , Evans or Musgrave approved O'Brien-Kreitzberg 's spending . As one city administrator who had to pay the bills said , " As long as it 's authorized by a manager , my butt 's covered . " <p> Like Musgrave , Evans also left the city to work for a private contractor that held a city airport contract . <p> O'Brien-Kreitzberg got its first airport management contract in 1992 , when it was hired as a technical expert to help deal with lawsuits arising from DIA design and construction . <p> It subsequently gained five amendments to its contract to serve as the city 's main engineering consultant on DIA 's automated and alternate baggage systems . The latest of those amendments was approved by Denver City Council last month . <p> Through the amendments , O'Brien-Kreitzberg 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Denver Aviation Director Jim DeLong said that , since DIA has opened , he has put in place a system with more checks and balances . <p> Vicki Braunagel , who heads DIA 's finance division , also now oversees the contract office and has staffers making sure only legitimate expenses are paid by the city . <p> " I have always felt strongly that there should be checks and balances , and that 's not to say it was done badly before , " DeLong said . <p> Witteveen also has weighed in to correct some of the " inconsistencies " in various personal service contracts at DIA . <p> Members of Webb 's administration have said over recent weeks that , if anything arises from the various federal and local investigations of DIA , it could be allegations of fraudulent billing and misrepresentations on minority contracting status by some companies . <p> So far , federal investigators have n't reported anything improper . <p> But city administrators continue to question bills submitted by O'Brien-Kreitzberg , including an airline ticket showing a trip to New Guinea . The bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disallowed because the firm could n't explain how the ticket related to airport business , said Debby Gibson of the airport contract administration office . <p> " It should n't have been billed to us , and it should not have gotten paid , " she said last week . Gibson has the chore of reviewing all of O'Brien-Kreitzberg 's billings and determining if the expenses should be paid . <p> So far , she has rejected $ 44,500 in expenses . Another $ 40,100 worth of receipts , including the Pebble Beach bills , are pending . The city has n't complained about O'Brien-Kreitzberg 's work at DIA . In fact , officials have praised the firm as one of the key day-to-day players in getting the airport opened . To Cochrane of O'Brien-Kreitzberg , that 's what matters . <p> " At the end of the day , we were hired on the basis that we knew our business , " he said . " And at the end of the day , we did a job for the city . "
