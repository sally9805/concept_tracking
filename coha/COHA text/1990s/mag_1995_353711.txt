Sometime this fall , if all goes well , a revolutionary new undersea vessel will be lowered gently into the waters of Monterey Bay for its maiden voyage . Named Deep Flight I , the 14-ft. - long , 2,900-lb. vehicle is shaped like a chubby , winged torpedo but flies like an underwater bird . Compared with the hard-to-maneuver submersibles that now haul deep-sea explorers sluggishly around the oceans , Deep Flight is an aquatic F-16 fighter . It can perform barrel rolls , race a fast-moving pod of whales or leap vertically right out of the sea . With a touch on the controls , a skilled pilot  --  who lies prone in a body harness , his or her head protruding into the craft 's hemispherical glass nose  --  can skim just below the ocean 's surface or plunge thousands of feet below . <P> More than 35 years after the bathyscaphe Trieste took two men , for the first and last time , 35,800 ft. down to the deepest spot in the world  --  the Mariana Trench 's Challenger Deep just off Guam in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last March a Japanese robot scouted a tiny section of the bottom of the 1,584-mile-long crevasse and sent back the first real-time video images of deepest-sea life . And in laboratories around the world , engineers are hard at work on an armada of sophisticated craft designed to explore  --  and in some cases exploit  --  the one great unconquered place on earth : the bottom of the sea . <P> The irony of 20th century scientists venturing out to explore waters that have been navigated for thousands of years is not lost on oceanographers . More than 100 expeditions have reached Everest , the 29,028-ft. pinnacle of the Himalayas ; manned voyages to space have become commonplace ; and robot probes have ventured to the outer reaches of the solar system . But only now are the deepest parts of the ocean coming within reach . " I think there 's a perception that we have already explored the sea , " says marine biologist Sylvia Earle , a former chief scientist at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and a co-founder of Deep Ocean Engineering , the San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began : " The reality is we know more about Mars than we know about the oceans . " <P> That goes not only for the sea 's uttermost depths but also for the still mysterious middle waters three or four miles down , and even for the " shallows " a few hundred feet deep . For while the push to reach the very bottom of the sea has fired the imagination of some of the world 's most daring explorers , it is just the most visible part of a broad international effort to probe the oceans ' depths . It 's a high-sea adventure fraught with danger , and  --  because of the expense  --  with controversy as well . <P> But the rewards could be enormous : oil and mineral wealth to rival Alaska 's North Slope and California 's Gold Rush ; scientific discoveries that could change our view of how the planet  --  and the life-forms on it  --  evolved ; natural substances that could yield new medicines and whole new classes of industrial chemicals . Beyond those practical benefits there is the intangible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great frontier .
