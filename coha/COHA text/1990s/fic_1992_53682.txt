It was one hundred and seven that June day . The swamp cooler on the roof had lowered the temperature down to the high nineties , and the walls and furniture were damp to the touch . I felt clammy and restless but there was nowhere to go except to the shopping center . My husband had flown to Cincinnati to be with his mother , who had just had a stroke , and the house was silent , hour after hour . I took my new Greek textbook into the bedroom , and lay on the bed , propping my head up with both pillows . I reviewed the alphabet , then repeated the three phrases I had learned at the first class on Tuesday . There was a whole column of vocabulary words that I was supposed to memorize for tonight 's class . My eyes felt heavy and I soon fell asleep . <p> I woke up to the sound of someone banging at the front door . I staggered down the hall and looked through the peephole . It was my next-door neighbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her face . I got the key to the dead bolt from underneath my pot of basil , and opened the door . A hot wind blew in through the screen as I fumbled with the hook . <p> " Alison , someone 's in my house ! " Judy 's voice was shrill and trembling . " I just got back from Phoenix . I 'm locked out . " <p> " Good God ! " I stepped out on my porch in my bare feet . The street was empty and silent except for the noise of the cicadas . The blinds were drawn in Judy 's brick bungalow . It looked the same as it had this morning when I went out to turn on my sprinklers . I hurriedly followed Judy across the brittle lawn . Her key worked in the lock , but the door handle would n't budge . " It 's bolted on the inside , " I said . <p> " So is the side door . " <p> " Let 's check the windows in the back . " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I pushed open the gate to Judy 's backyard , where four dusty mulberry trees made circles of ineffectual shade . The lawn was almost dead , and the dry grass cut my feet . A pane in one of the casement windows , near the latch , was broken . <p> " They did n't get in that way , " Judy said fiercely . " I had locks put on all my windows last year . " <p> We went out of the backyard and around to the far side of the house , where huge , pink-blooming oleanders grew . We had to push the branches out of our faces . All the panes were broken out of the middle window of Judy 's bedroom , and the metal frame had been bent out of shape and pried back . <p> " They 've used a crowbar , " I said . <p> " Do you think they 're still in there ? " Judy whispered . <p> " It must have happened last night , " I whispered back . " Let 's go call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judy kept clenching her fists and groaning . She almost tripped on an ant hill . <p> " I was only gone one night , one single night ! " <p> " I did n't know you were gone , " I said . " I did n't hear anything . " <p> I dialed the police emergency number , but it was busy . I called the regular number . I handed the phone to Judy as soon as someone answered , then put on my tennis shoes . I was feeling shaky , too . There had been break-ins all down die street , and I was beginning to feel tense whenever I came back from the grocery store . I 'd sit in die car for a minute , just holding the steering wheel . The Spanish-speaking family across the street had recently installed bars on their windows . <p> " They said twenty minutes , " Judy said . She covered her face with her hands . " I did n't have anything worth stealing.I feel like I 'm dreaming . " <p> " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wait at the front door . I 'll unbolt it . " <p> I tied my hair back , and we went outside again . The oleander leaves smelled like tar in the heat . I swept the broken glass off the window ledge , and pulled myself through the window . Glass crunched under my tennis shoes as I jumped down onto the tile floor inside . The bedroom was a mess . All the drawers had been pulled out of the dresser , and Judy 's clothes were lying in heaps . The top mattress had been shifted partway off the box spring . Open shoe boxes were tumbled at the closet door . A bottle of hand lotion had been poured out on the floor . <p> I hurried down the hall . I slid into a big pool of water and almost fell . The living-room carpet was soaking wet , covered with big pieces of glass mixed in with colored pebbles and shells . I realized with a shock that it was Judy 's aquarium . It had been filled with beautiful striped and fringed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been invited into Judy 's house she had shown me her fish They all had names . Now the fish lay in little heaps here and there on the carpet . <p> The sofa cushions had been ripped open , and some of Judy 's books were soaking in water from the aquarium . I tried not to step on any of the dead fish . I shot back the cheap brass bolt at the top of the door . <p> " How bad ? " She was gripping the edge of the screen door . <p> " Pretty bad . It 's your aquarium . " <p> I stepped past her . " Oh , no , no , no , " I heard her cry . <p> I looked down the street for some sign of the police . A hot breeze was stirring the palo verde in the front yard . A whirling dust devil rose up at the curb and then dissolved into the air . The sky was a high and perfect blue over the mauve Santa Catalina Mountains on the horizon . <p> Judy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the street , who had recently moved here from Nogales . I had exchanged hellos with a retired couple from Minnesota who lived in a pink stucco house down the street . But all around me were strangers living in brick or stucco bungalows with swamp coolers or air-conditioning compressors on the roofs . And at this time of day , except for the sound of the compressors , and the growing roar of an Air Force jet crossing the sky , I might have been looking out at some ruined city in Mesopotamia . <p> Judy came out on the step . Her eyes were red and the muscle of her left cheek was twitching . She held a glass of water which contained a bright yellow fish . <p> " Sammy was in a little pool of water . He might live . " She lifted the glass up against the sky . The fish was floating near the surface , not moving . <p> " What did they take , Judy ? " <p> " My old jewelry box is gone , " she said , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would they take that ? It was junk  --  costume jewelry , trinkets , my grandmother 's cameo , my high school ring  --  who would want that stuff ? " <p> " Any gold ? " <p> She frowned . " I had a couple of lockets , I guess . But my God , Alison ! They took the lid off the toilet . They dumped the flour in the canister into the sink . My big Shakespeare is ruined  --  and the aquarium ! Why did they break my aquarium ? " <p> " They thought you had hidden something down in the pebbles . " <p> " Hidden something ! " Judy laughed , a little hysterically . She looked down into the glass , and poked her finger at the fish . " He 's dead , too , " she said . " They 're all dead . " <p> The police pulled up at the curb . I spoke to them briefly , then left , telling Judy I would help her dean up when they were finished . I told her to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left before she telephoned . During that hour I had done nothing but pace up and down in my own house . I looked at my dresser , at my scattered earrings , at my bookshelves , my typewriter , my neat kitchen counters , my medicine cabinet . I transposed the destruction I had seen in Judy 's house on my own house , and I felt breathless and angry . <p> Judy had been crying . Her eyes were shiny , and her face was mottled , but she seemed to have herself under control . The fish were gone , and I did n't ask her whet had become of them . We gingerly picked up the big pieces of glass , swept up the rest , and smoothed out the wet books to dry on the kitchen table . Judy had called a glazier , and while we straightened up her bedroom , he replaced the broken panes . <p> " I should have installed bars , " she told the glazier as he got out his tools . <p> He was a thickset , freckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It would have slowed them down , that 's all . I 've seen plenty of bars pried open . If they want to get in , they 're going to get in no matter what . " <p> Afterwards , we went over to my house for supper . Judy sat at the table while I made spaghetti . She kept playing with the buckle on her belt . Occasionally a spasm crossed her face , or she made a fist . <p> " What were you doing in Phoenix ? " I asked as I snipped off some basil leaves from the plant near the door . <p> " I had a couple of job interviews . Then , I stayed over with some friends  --  people John and I used to know before the divorce . But we did n't have much in common anymore . " She rubbed her forehead . " They must have been gasping on the floor for hours . " <p> " Try not to think . " <p> Her voice rose . " It was just a spur of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fran and Dick and they said , Hey , come on up . But I should have driven back . " Her whole face clenched up in pain . " I 'm thirty-eight . I ought to get over being lonely . " <p> I poured her a glass of wine and set it in front of her . She looked at it . There was a stack of books on the table and she pulled them over . " Books about Greece ? Are you going to Greece ? " <p> " Next May if we can save enough money . " <p> Judy unfolded the map at the back of one of the books . It was a large map , and covered the whole table . She stared down at the blue water as she sipped her wine . <p> " I was there once , " she said , pointing to one of the islands . I was at the stove and I could n't see which one . " I took a boat . I was twenty-two . I was in love with a French boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other . " <p> " What happened ? " <p> She sighed . " I do n't even remember his name . He had to go back to Nantes , and I had to meet someone in Rome . I lost his address . " She swept her hand across the map . " I 'm careless . I lose everything . " <p> Judy sobbed , and took a big drink of wine to cover herself . I felt embarrassed . All the comforting phrases that came to my mind sounded hollow . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Judy said in a moment . " I 'm just feeling sorry for myself . My whole life seems like a waste . " <p> I brought the plates of spaghetti to the table . Judy refolded the map , not looking at me . <p> " You 'll feel better tomorrow , " I said awkwardly . " Why do n't you come with me to my Greek class ? " <p> " I did n't know you were taking a class . " <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid it 'll be canceled . You need ten students , and there were only five at the first class . The teacher was going to see if she could find some more people . " <p> " You want me to sign up ? " <p> " Well , no , " I said . " Unless you feel like it . But she 's going to bring some slides of Greece tonight . " <p> Judy thumbed through one of my guidebooks . She paused over a photograph of two headless statues , a man and a woman . " All right , " she said , frowning a little . " I 'll come . " <p> " What 's that ? " I asked as she continued to stare at the photograph . <p> " It 's called the House of Cleopatra . It 's on Delos . I was there . I remember I was looking down et the mosaics on the floor when a snake came out of the weeds . It was a little green snake . I suppose it was harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't afraid . I was n't afraid of anything in those days . I kept looking at the snake and then up at the statues . The couple who lived in that house , which was nothing more than a waist-high wall and a floor , had put up those statues of themselves , and they were still standing , but without heads . And the snake was sunning himself on their floor , centuries and centuries later . " Judy looked over at the window where part of the roof of her own house was visible . " Do you think my floor will still be there in a thousand years ? " <p> I deliberately clattered the dishes . " We 've got to hurry , " I said . <p> I parked on the campus near the Union . There were only a few cars in the lot . The sidewalks were thick with brown grasshoppers which had come in from the desert . They hopped and scattered in all directions as we walked through them . The pigeons nesting up in the palm trees cooed loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The classroom was in the sub-basement of the library . We took the escalator down two flights . The hallway was brightly lit and cold as a refrigerator . Two tanned girls in shorts hurried around us and disappeared into a classroom . <p> I opened the door of the Modern Greek classroom . The room was empty . Judy and I each sat down at little blond wood desks . The concrete block walls were painted pastel blue . The chalkboard was green . The air-conditioning vent made a faint rattle as the cold air poured out . <p> " When does class start ? " asked Judy in a hushed voice , looking around at the empty desks . <p> I glanced at my watch . " Three minutes . It looks bad , does n't it ? I hope some other people show up . " <p> The door opened , and Mrs. Mastrapas came in , wheeling a metal cart with a slide projector on it . She smiled at us shyly . She was a small , dark-haired woman who looked French . Even her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , " she said . She looked nervously around the empty room . She took her Greek textbook off the cart , and placed it carefully on the large oak teacher 's desk at the front of the room . She opened a red canvas tote bag and pulled out a computer roll sheet . <p> " I have five people on the roll , " she said . " I need ten , but they said they would not cancel the class if I could get seven students by tonight . " <p> Mrs. Mastrapas looked at her watch , then sighed and sat down in the chair behind the teacher 's desk . The room was eerily silent . I looked down at the cover of my textbook . Judy played with her belt . <p> " I 'm sorry , " said Mrs. Mastrapas , looking at the door of the classroom , which remained closed . " I must cancel the class . " <p> " That 's too bad , " I said awkwardly . " So many people leave town in June . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her head . She got up slowly . She smoothed he , skirt distractedly . <p> " Have you taught Greek before ? " asked Judy in a tight , embarrassed voice . <p> " This was to be an experiment , to see if anyone was interested in Modern Greek . " Mrs. Mastrapas looked at the slide projector . " Why did those other students not come back ? " She looked at me . " Did you find the assignment too difficult ? " <p> " Oh , no , " I said . " But in the summer people change their minds a lot . " " I have never taught before , " Mrs. Mastrapas said . " Perhaps they could tell I have never taught before . " <p> " I 'm sure they could n't , " I said . " Anyway , you 're a native speaker . You know the language perfectly . " <p> She nodded . " I grew up on Crete . My husband is Greek-American . I used to go back every summer , but my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece anymore . I thought it would help me to remember my language if I taught it . " <p> " I 'd love to see your slides , " Judy said . " If you are n't in a hurry . " <p> Mrs. Mastrapas 's face brightened a little . " Would you ? They belong to the library and I have n't seen them either . " <p> Judy and I helped Mrs. Mastrapas move a few desks . She wheeled the projector to the back of the room and plugged it in . I pulled down the screen above the blackboard . When she had the projector ready , and properly focused , Judy turned off the lights . <p> We looked at the slides of Greece . I recognized the Parthenon and Delphi , and the windmills on Mykonos , and even the headless statues of the House of Cleopatra , but Mrs. Mastrapas had to identify the Asclepium on Kos for me , and various views of the Peloponnese . At first she was talkative . But when a picture of a mountain slope covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . <p> " Where 's that ? " asked Judy . <p> " Mount Ida on Crete . " <p> Next came a slide that showed a herd of goats and a shepherd . Mrs. Mastrapas said nothing . She began to flash the slides forward in silence . I looked at Judy but I could not see her expression in the dark . I watched scenes of Greece pass before my eyes , broken columns , poppies on hillsides , temples , stone lions , ferryboats , a long strand of beach , nets drying , whitewashed houses . The scene of a mountaintop , with a tiny white chapel in the distance , remained on the screen for a long time . I looked over at Mrs. Mastrapas . I could see her faintly in a little light that escaped from the projector . She was bent over with her head in her hands . Her shoulders were heaving . <p> I felt Judy stiffen beside me , and I heard her swallow hard . Mrs. Mastrapas was crying . I remembered how stupid I had sounded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about his mother . The stroke had paralyzed her on one side , and robbed her of speech . All I could say was , " How terrible ! That 's terrible ! " <p> Judy stood up . " Please do n't cry , " she said softly . <p> Mrs. Mastrapas sniffed loudly . " Oh , forgive me . Forgive me . " She hastily pressed the button and another slide appeared . " That 's the Corinth Canal , " she said , struggling to control her voice . <p> Judy remained standing , partly blocking my view of the screen . Then she ran to the door , banging into several desks on her way . She opened the door , momentarily flooding the dark classroom with light , and let it slam shut behind her . <p> " Oh , what have I done ! " Mrs. Mastrapas groaned . " I 'm so sorry . " <p> I hurried over to the light switch . In the sudden glare I saw that Mrs. Mastrapas 's small , lined face was streaked with tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'm a fool , " she said . <p> " Oh , it 's not your fault . She 's very upset . Her house was burglarized today . " <p> I opened the door and looked out in the hall . Judy had made it halfway down to the escalator , and was now leaning with her head against the wall , her shoulders shaking . <p> I looked back at Mrs. Mastrapas . She had turned away from me . She was clenching the edge of the projector cart with one blue-knuckled hand . <p> I was standing between two crying women and I did n't know what to do . <p> Then Judy called down the hall : " I'II be in the ladies ' room ! " <p> I went over to Mrs. Mastrapas . She was wrapping the cord around the projector . " I do n't know how I let that happen , " she said , not looking at me . " I started feeling so sad . " <p> " Let me help you box those slides . " I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned it upside down . <p> " Oh , thank you , " she said in a small voice . " Please apologize to your friend . " <p> I helped Mrs. Mastrapas wheel the projector to the elevator , and waited until the doors had closed on her . Then I went into the ladies ' room . Judy was looking at herself in the mirror over the sinks . <p> " I just felt awful , " she said . " When I heard her crying I just felt awful . " <p> " Are you O.K. ? " <p> She nodded . She smoothed the swollen skin under her eyes with her finger . " Let 's go somewhere , Alison . " <p> " All right . I left my book in the classroom , though . " <p> When we went to get my book , I saw that Mrs. Mastrapas had forgotten her own book on the oak desk . I took it along . I could call her tomorrow . I followed Judy out into the hot black night . The stars were large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any humidity . I could see lights in the foothills miles away . We drove up to Speedway and entered the stream of traffic . <p> Neon glittered and lights flashed from showrooms on both sides of us . Jeeps with blaring radios darted past us , and a dangerous-looking group of black-jacketed men on motorcycles roared by , weaving in and out of the big , air-conditioned cars with out-of-state plates . A bank thermometer flashed ninety-seven degrees . <p> " Where do you want to go ? " I asked Judy as we drove past stereo outlets and Chinese take-out places . <p> " There , " she said , pointing to a glittering temple in the distance . Illuminated fountains jetted into the air in front of it . The grounds were landscaped with palmettos and prickly pear . " Let 's play miniature golf . " <p> We pulled into the crowded lot and found a spot near a convertible where half a dozen teenagers sat on the hood , passing a joint around . The pagoda-roofed temple was an arcade full of noisy electronic games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took our clubs and balls outside . I had never been here before , and ordinarily would have been delighted by the elaborate grassy grounds , the fountains , and the bridges over streams . I liked the illusion of humidity . But I hit my ball without thinking . Now that it was dark , I was beginning to worry about my house . I had left the blinds open and no lights burning . <p> When we reached a Swiss chalet , with a hole in the door for a ball , I noticed a commotion a couple of holes ahead of us . A blond man in a T-shirt was singing and waving his club in the air . A crowd was gathering . <p> " Hole in one ! " cried Judy . " I did it ! " <p> I was looking away . " What 's going on over there ? " <p> Judy retrieved her orange ball and stepped out beside me on a little bridge . " He 's overdosed on something . " <p> Two uniformed policemen came hurrying across the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's your ball . " <p> It took me seven strokes . By the time we finished our last hole , it was clear that Judy had beaten me soundly . She seemed almost cheerful as she added the score , but as we drove back home I felt the gloom descend on her again . <p> " I just remembered my watch , " she muttered . " My good watch was in the jewelry box . " <p> We pulled into my driveway , and we both sat looking at our dark houses . The hot air smelled of creosote . I saw a jagged slash of lightning over the mountains . <p> " Thanks , Alison . " <p> " Will you be all right ? " I asked , opening the car door . The light came on . Judy was twisting her hands together as if she were strangling something . <p> " I feel angry but I 'm all right . " <p> I took a deep breath before I unlocked the door of my house . I did n't hear anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exactly as I 'd left it . I closed the venetian blinds , then checked the back door I went around the house and tested all the windows , making sure the nails my husband had driven into the frames were still in place , although , after seeing Judy 's window , I knew they were useless . The small window in the bathroom , which had to be open a crack for the swamp cooler to work , made me nervous in spite of the special lock . <p> I could n't sleep . I could hear the wind blowing through the Italian cypresses on the side of the house . Once a sharp noise made me sit upright in bed , my heart pounding . I knew at once that the wind had blown my gate open , but I peered through the blinds to make sure . The gate was swinging back and forth on its hinges . I told myself to go outside and fasten it again but I was afraid . <p> I looked at my watch in the moonlight . Two o'clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I imagined her pacing up and down restlessly , muttering and wringing her hands . <p> At three , I got up and brought the Greek guidebooks into the bedroom . I looked at the pictures of Athens , and Rhodes , and Samos , but they depressed me . At first I was n't sure why , but then I realized it was the thought of the money . Instead of air fare , we ought to replace the swamp cooler with an air conditioner , so we could close all the windows . We should put up bars and install a burglar alarm . <p> Somehow I fell asleep . I woke up to the sound of the doves , my eyes heavy . I made coffee , then went out and turned the sprinkler system on in the front yard . A lizard scurried out from under the pyracantha near the step . I went into the backyard to water the olive trees that my husband and I had planted two years ago when we first bought this house . <p> The trees were a little taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it would be shiny years before I could pick olives from their branches . <p> My watering can was n't near the faucet where I kept it . I saw it Iying over in front of the shed , where we kept the garden tools . The wind must have blown it there . Yet I felt my breath catch . Surely I had left the rake leaning against the side of the house . Now it was Iying on the ground in front of the shed . <p> The wind could not have blown the rake . I must have made a mistake . I must have forgotten where I left it . <p> I unlocked the padlock on the shed . When I opened the double doors , I had to jump back while a black widow scurried into a dark recess . I gingerly replaced the rake . Then I took my time watering the olives . This was my house . These were my trees . <p> After I drank my coffee , I looked up Mrs. Mastrapas in the phone book and gave her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her I would drop off her book on my way to the grocery store . Then I emptied the waste cans into the kitchen garbage , and took the bag outside . When I took the lid off the smelly metal can , I saw two beer bottles in the bottom . <p> I stared down at the amber bottles which were covered with tiny ants . I never bought that brand of beer . Someone had crept up my drive last night to dump them . <p> Mrs. Mastrapas lived in an older neighborhood of winding streets lined by palms . Her house was a long rancher with a red tiled roof . I parked in the drive behind a Volvo station wagon . As I walked up to the front door , I noticed the ornate bars that covered the windows . There was an alarm sticker on the window nearest the door . I rang the bell . I stood directly in front of the peephole so that I would be dearly visible . I heard the heavy lock click several times , and finally the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Mastrapas said . She was wearing a white sleeveless dress and red sandals . She smiled at me , and I stepped into the cool hallway . I handed her the book . <p> " Please stay for a while , " she said . " Come sit down . " <p> " I really ca n't , " I said , but she was already moving away . I followed her . The living room was mostly white , but I hardly noticed it at first , for it was dominated by a huge picture window with a view of a cactus garden . I felt I was looking out at the desert itself . There were several mature saguaros , ocotillos , barrel cactuses in bloom , beavertail , agave , and yucca with tall spikes of white bells , all growing in natural profusion . <p> " Oh , it 's beautiful ! " I exclaimed . <p> Mrs. Mastrapas nodded . " I sit here for hours just looking out , " she said . " Now please , sit down . I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue , " she laughed , as I opened my mouth . " You sit down . It was so nice of you to bring my book . If I ca n't teach you my language , I can at least make you coffee . " <p> I sat down . The nubby white sofa cushions prickled the backs of my legs because I was wearing shorts . I could feel a draft of cold air on the back of my neck , but it was pleasant to stare out at the miniature desert . <p> A cactus wren flew out of one of the saguaros . A lizard flashed . <p> Mrs. Mastrapas resumed with a tray . She had demitasse cups filled with thick , rich coffee , and a sticky pastry that reminded me of shredded wheat . She told me it was called kataifi . <p> " And how is your friend ? " Mrs. Mastrapas asked . " You said she had been burglarized . That 's terrible . It 's happening to everyone . " <p> " They broke her aquarium . All her fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful . Sometimes I feel like a prisoner here . You saw my big lock ?

Last month my friends down the street  --  they both work  --  came home and their house had been broken into . They collect antique silver . Some of the pieces were missing , but not everything . Two days later the burglars came back and took the rest . " <p> " That 's terrible , " I said . <p> Mrs. Mastrapas looked around her living room . " I do n't have anything valuable , but I have some gold bracelets . They were my mother 's . I have to keep them in the safety deposit box . " She stretched out her bare , tanned arm . " I do n't dare wear them anymore or keep them in the house . " <p> I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick sediment . Judy did n't have any antique silver or gold bracelets to melt down .

" <p> " One more cup , " Mrs. Mastrapas insisted . I could see she was lonely so I let her take my cup back to the kitchen . I went to the window and looked out at the cactus . I noticed a side door leading to a patio . It also had a heavy lock . <p> " Your house is a fortress , " I said when she returned . <p> She sighed . " When Yannis is n't here , I have trouble sleeping . We 've talked about going back to Greece when he retires , but ... " She shrugged elaborately . " Yannis is American . He was born in Chicago .

" <p> I drank my second cup of coffee hastily , and gave my phone number to Mrs. Mastrapas in case she ever arranged to teach Modern Greek again . Instead of going directly to the store , I stopped by my house to make sure it was all right . It was noon , and the neighborhood was silent . A man in a straw hat pedaled slowly by on his bicycle while I sat in my car . I watched him suspiciously . <p> Throughout the next week , I found myself increasingly reluctant to leave the house . I forced myself to drive out to the shopping mall for exercise , but the whole time I was wandering through the air conditioning , looking at swimsuits and running shoes and stereo equipment , or picking through sale blouses , I was tense with worry , and by the time I reached home , I had a stomach ache .

He seemed happy to stay in the house at Christmas . " <p> " He 's in San Diego for the summer . " <p> " Judy could keep an eye on things . " <p> " She 's gone a lot , " I said evasively . <p> " Too bad , " he sighed . " I 'd wish you 'd come , though God knows it 's not exactly cheerful here . " <p> " It 's not that , " I said . " I 'm just worried about the house . How 's the weather there ? " I added , trying to change the subject . <p> " It 's been raining a lot , but I like it . The day lilies are out . I 'd forgotten they grow like weeds here . And the zucchini Mother planted are bloomimg  --  they have flowers like big yellow stars . I walked with Dad around the old neighborhood last night . I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like an alien . " <p> " I wish I could come , " I said , " but I do n't see how . " <p> After I hung up , I checked all the windows . I stood in front of the door for a long time , but all I heard was the rasp of the pyracantha . Nevertheless , I could n't sleep . I sat reading the Blue Guide to Greece until dawn , and then I made myself some scrambled eggs and coffee . I went out and watered . Then I fell asleep on the couch in my clothes , and did n't wake up until the afternoon . I was brushing my teeth when someone knocked at the door . The blinds were still shut , so I tiptoed down the hall and looked through the peephole . A young , dark-haired man in blue jogging shorts and an Aspen T-shirt stood on the step . I had never seen him before . He knocked again and I held my breath . I could hear him shuffling his feet on the step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted a corner of the blind . He crossed the street and knocked at the Romeros ' . Mrs. Romeros answered her door . They spoke for a moment . She shut the door , and the young man went down the street , casually " lancing at houses as if he were looking for a particular one . He disappeared from sight . <p> I did n't leave the house all that day . In the evening I tried watching television , but after a while I was afraid the noise would distract me , and keep me from hearing an intruder , so I turned it off . I sat in silence . I had to read the sentences in the guidebook two or three times in order to make sense of them . <p> Somehow I did fall asleep . In the morning I took a shower and washed my hair . I felt better . When I went out to turn on the front yard sprinklers , Judy came around the side of her house with a lawn mower . <p> " I got a job ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She was wearing cut-off jeans and a blue work shirt . She left her mower and came over to my yard . <p> " That 's wonderful . What kind of job ? " <p> " I 'm going to be an underwriter . They 're sending me to Houston for training , then I 'll work in Phoenix . I suppose it 's boring but I do n't care . " She gestured behind her . " So much for Cleopatra 's house . Let it fall . ' <p> " Oh , so you 're going to move ? " <p> " You bet . My real estate guy is bringing the sign over today . I thought I 'd better mow . " <p> " When are you going to Houston ? " <p> " Next weekend ! " She stretched both her arms above her head , as if she were doing an aerobic exercise . She was smiling . " Thank God ! Mel that 's my real estate guy  --  will keep an eye on this dump until it 's sold . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went back to mowing . She was singing to herself . I went inside . I was happy for Judy , but the thought of an empty house next door was disturbing . It might be months before it was sold . Still , I could n't help feeling more cheerful . A little sleep , and a little conversation , was what I had needed . I made some sun tea and set the jar out in the backyard . Then I clipped the pyracantha . I put on my straw hat , and walked slowly through the heat to the convenience store three blocks away . <p> Two young women in shorts and halter-tops were standing near the soda machine outside . One was eating a Popsicle . The other , who wore large , round sunglasses , was gesturing excitedly . <p> " It was the middle of the day . She 'd just gone to the mailbox . He must have got in the bathroom window . " <p> " Oh , my God , " said the girl with the Popsicle . <p> They hushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bought some bread and club soda . I looked around at the bright shelves . I could n't remember what else I wanted . I kept thinking about the women outside , but they were gone when I left . <p> On my way home , I passed a blond man in loose white trousers who had a small daypack on his shoulders . <p> " Howdy , " he said . His eyes were hidden behind mirror sunglasses . <p> " Hello , " I answered , hurrying past him . I told myself he was just a student on his way home from the university , but at the same time I realized that I had become suspicious of everyone . I walked past small , rundown bungalows , with weedy lawns , and noticed the bars over the windows . <p> A large " For Sale " sign stood in Judy 's yard . She had mowed her dry grass , and now her yard looked as if it were covered with straw . Her car was gone . Already her house looked abandoned . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew I had fastened it tightly . I walked slowly up my drive with my grocery bag . I set it on the burning hood of my car , and forced myself to go into the backyard . My jar of sun tea was on its side , and all the water had spilled out the screw top and was evaporating in the sun . Someone had kicked it as they crossed the yard . <p> Iclenched the redwood gate so tightly that a splinter slid into my finger . I tried to think . If Judy had come back here looking for me , and knocked over my jar , she would have righted it again . So would the gas meter man . Only someone who did n't belong in my yard would have left it like that . <p> I took the jar and the grocery bag inside , checked all my windows , and locked the gate again . I got a needle and dug the splinter out of my finger . Then I walked slowly around my house from room to room , hugging my arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guest room where we kept the photography equipment we never used anymore . I looked in the kitchen cabinets and at the medicine-chest mirror . I ran my hand along the back of my old green sofa , then sat in the rocking chair . <p> I could n't live like this . I felt tired and confused . Should I look up security systems in the phone book ' I went down the hall to the telephone in the bedroom . The Greece guidebooks were Iying on the bed . I sat down on the chenille spread and began opening them aimlessly , looking at the pictures but not paying them much attention . Then the photograph of the headless statues jumped out at me . I looked at the chipped pillar in the foreground , and at the rubble of a wall . A man named Dioscurides and a woman named Cleopatra had lived in that house on an island which was no longer inhabited . Twenty thousand people had lived on that island and it was now only stones and weeds . <p> I closed the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got out a suitcase . I packed a few odds and ends of clothing and trinkets , then went around the house gathering anything that I thought would break my heart to lose . I wrapped up my three-hundred-day clock in a shawl , and rolled my blue Mexican glasses into newspaper . I got my husband 's broken pocket watch , and the camera and lenses . I cleaned out the desk , making sure I had all the tax records and check and credit card information . I packed my diary , and then remembered the picture plate of a moose on the wall that had belonged to my grandmother . I wrapped it carefully in tissue . Then I loaded the car . I did it openly for the whole neighborhood to see . I put the typewriter on the seat , next to the box that contained my wedding shoes . I checked all the windows , set light timers in the bedroom and the living room , and pulled the blinds . I got out the screwdriver and took the chains off the doors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded the bills , and hid them in my underwear drawer . I did n't want the burglar to get angry . I Iocked the door and got in my car . <p> I drove to a nice motel on the east side of town . It was late aftemoon , and the atmosphere was clear . The saguaros and other cactus up the foothill slopes stood out dearly and sharply , and I could see little ridges and canyons not ordinarily visible . One thin cloud drifted across the blue sky . <p> After I checked into the motel , I drove around to the back and unloaded my car . I turned on the air conditioner under the window , and lay on the queen-size bed until the stuffy room grew cold . Then I put on my swimsuit . <p> I was the only one in the pool , and I swam back and forth in the green water until I was exhausted and my eyes burned with chlorine . Then I lay on a chaise lounge in the shade . The water in my ears helped me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some screaming children burst into the water . <p> I showered and dressed . It was still early , but I went into the Mexican restaurant attached to the motel and ordered chile rellenos and a pitcher of strawberry margaritas . Afterwards I felt dizzy . I went back to my room and watched the satellite television until I could n't keep my eyes open . I fell into a deep sleep . <p> I woke up with a headache and a feeling of dread in my chest . I looked around the motel room . The round table under the swag lamp was covered with my belongings . So was the long , imitation maple dresser . I wished I could stay here and spend the day in the pool . <p> I was feeling too ill to eat breakfast . I repacked the car , and drove around to the front of the motel to turn in the key . It was early , and the glass door was locked . I rang the bell . A Doberman on the other side started barking and jumping against the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried out from behind the desk and dragged the Doberman away . Then he returned to the door . <p> " Sorry , " he said , tucking in his shirt . " I 'm running a little late . I 've usually got Attila out of the way by six . <p> " Attila , " I said , handing him the key . " That 's a good name . " <p> " Yeah , I guess . One of the night clerks was shot through the head last month . We 've had to increase security . <p> " Oh , God ! " <p> " What a world . " He shook his head , handing me a copy of my bill . " Well , you have a nice day now . You from back east ? " <p> " No , " I said , folding the bill into my purse . " I 'm from here . " <p> My mouth was dry when I pulled up the driveway . The house looked the same as when I had left it , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in the car for a moment , rubbing my forehead . Then with a little thrill I noticed that one of the slats of the kitchen blind had been bent over , as if someone had looked out . I knew I had arranged the blinds smoothly . <p> I slung my camera around my neck and got slowly out of the car . It was over now . The gate was shut but not latched . I went into the backyard . There was broken glass on the ground . The burglar had broken panes in two of the windows in an attempt to reach the crank handles inside . But the nails had stopped him . The study window in the corner , shielded by one of the olive trees , had been pried open with a crowbar like Judy 's window . <p> I unlocked the door of my house and stepped inside . The cornmeal had been dumped out on the kitchen floor , and the lining had been ripped away from chair bottoms . My underwear was scattered over the bedroom . The bed had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor of the study . <p> I called the police . While I was on the phone , a brown lizard , which must have scurried up the wall and come in the open window , darted in panic down the hall . <p> I walked around , photographing the ruin of my house . <p> <p> By Maura Stanton <p>
