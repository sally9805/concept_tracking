THE WORLD AT WAR <p> Collar the lot ! ' Fifty years ago this summer in Britain , an exotic miscellany of foreign refugees , academics and Italian restauranteurs were rounded up for internment in response to Churchill 's famous injunction . Colin Holmes explains the policy , the pressure of the times and their aftermath . <p> The Second World War began in September 1939 but the sense of imminent danger on the Home Front did not take hold in that first year of the war . It was in 1940 rather than 1939 that the fear developed of Britain falling to Germany . <p> By the summer of 1940 the German armed forces had swept through Western Europe and Scandinavia . Another year ! another deadly blow ! another mighty Empire overthrown ! ' , Wordsworth had written in his November 1806 as the French Revolutionary armies swept across Europe . In 1940 Britain had to contend with the withdrawal from Dunkirk , the subsequent sustained German military assault during the so-called spitfire summer ' and the blitz on British cities . It was a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Britain at that time can be absorbed from George Orwell 's The lion and the Unicorn , with its dramatic and haunting first sentence , As I write highly civilised human beings are flying overhead trying to kill me . ' <p> In these circumstances the lives of enemy aliens living in Britain took a turn for the worse . It has to be recalled that during the 1930s , following the assumption of power by the National Socialists , an irregular stream of refugees left Germany to start new lives in other countries . After 1938 , following the Anschluss , these refugees were joined by other exiles who departed from Austria . By their departure these refugees from Central Europe were expressing their opposition to National Socialism , but this fact did not guarantee a warm welcome for them in Britain nor indeed in the other countries , such as the United States and Canada , which they tried to enter . In the case of Britain the 1919 Aliens Act placed strict controls over the entry , movement , and deportation of aliens . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1929 Wall Street crash and , in particular , the consequent high levels of unemployment , contributed to the British Government 's reluctance to admit any substantial number of refugees . Furthermore , the fact that many of those intent on leaving Austria and Germany  --  perhaps up to 90 per cent - were Jews , created its own tensions : hiding behind the fear that the entry of Jewish refugees would encourage the expression of anti-Semitism , the mandarins in Whitehall and the politicians whom they advised could indulge in their own brands of amorphous anti-Semitism and remain unenthusiastic about any smooth and growing flow of refugees from Central Europe . The British Government also maintained strict controls over the entry of Jewish refugees into the mandated territory of Palestine . <p> With the outbreak of war the position of many of the 56 , OOO refugees from Austria and Germany who had managed to enter Britain soon deteriorated . Those who , by the outbreak of war had not assumed British nationality became converted into enemy aliens . The fact that Britain girded itself up to oppose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newcomers any immunity against various hostile shafts of public opinion and the oppressive powers of the State . <p> Even before the outbreak of war the Government had formed the opinion that a degree of internment of enemy aliens would be necessary . A sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence reported on April 1st , 1939 , that some measure of internment would be required at an early stage of any consequent war . The full Committee of Imperial Defence accepted this recommendation on April 6th and approved the action of the War Office in reserving accommodation for 18 , OOO civilian internees . <p> When war did break out the Government took down the internment files which had been created during the First World War and on September 4th , 1939 , the Home Off ordered an immediate review ' of all Austrians and Germans living in Britain . The Government already had in its possession details on aliens which had been gathered by the security services . However , to assist in the process of categorising enemy aliens into those who were to be interned ( Category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions ( Category B ) and those who were to be exempt from internment or restriction ( Category C ) the Government established a number of investigative tribunals before which enemy aliens had to appear . By January 1840 , as a result of such activity , 528 enemy aliens had been interned and just over 8 , O00 had been placed under restrictions . <p> At first little pressure can be detected for any extension of these restrictions . However , in 1940 as the German military threat increased , we can trace a hardening of attitudes and policy . Mass Observation in its public opinion surveys provides clear evidence of this growing concern about enemy aliens . At the same time , the formation in May 1940 of Churchill 's wartime coalition Government encouraged a sharpening of official policy . Against this background in the second half of May , the authorities rounded up and interned all those enemy aliens who had been placed in Category B. In the following June all Category C Austrian and German men were interned . The same month witnessed the arrest of Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10th , 1940 . As a result of such measures by the end of June 1940 the only enemy aliens remaining free were non-suspect Austrian , German and Italian women . The police also received instructions not to interfere with the invalid and the infirm among the enemy alien communities . The state also issued instructions to give special consideration to every enemy alien who had specialist knowledge which might be useful to the war effort . <p> A number of striking reminiscences reveal the initial sense of shock and dismay which shuddered through those who were detained . Why should they pick me up ? . . . I 've been in England since 1907 and I 've never been any trouble ' , protested P.G . Leoni , the well-known Soho restaurateur . Walter Fliess who , together with his wife , opened a vegetarian restaurant in London in 1934 , recalls that when they were detained it came as such a terrible shock . . . we were just the victims of a huge governmental public relations exercise . . . the tribunal was a farce from beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they were arrested . Professor Paul Jacobsthal remembers that On Friday July 5th in the morning , when I was peacefully working on a Celtic geometric ornament , a knock came on my door in Christ Church College , Oxford and a plain clothes police officer produced a warrant of arrest . . . ' <p> Precise figures on the number of internees are hard to calculate but it has been estimated that the trawl resulted in the internment of 22 , O00 Austrians and Germans and 4,300 Italians . Included in these bald figures are people who by 1940 had achieved public recognition . Franz Borkenau , a fierce critic of Fascism , and Stefan Lorant , the editor of Picture Post are two names easily recalled . Other internees , whose eminence came later , included the businessman Charles Forte , the historian Francis Carsten , and the scientist Max Perutz . <p> The events in the spring and summer of 1940 did not spell the end of the Government 's interest in enemy aliens . In the summer of that year , with the internment programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deportation of enemy aliens , mainly to Australia and Canada . This programme generated its own horrors . The treatment of detainees aboard the ship Dunera on its way to Australia is one notorious development . One of those on board remembers vividly that we were robbed , there 's no doubt about it ... By the guards , officers also . . . They did pretty awful things . . . but war is war ' . At the same time as pursuing a policy of deportation the Government encouraged internees to make their own arrangements to leave Britain for the United States . I the event , however , this scheme never became effective since it ran into opposition from within both the American administration an the British Government . <p> Following the swift and decisive acceleration in the internment programme , it might be assumed that the internees would remain ) in their camps until the end of the war . In fact , the majority were soon returned to freedom . Towards the end of July 194O , one month after the last of the internees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that certain categories were eligible for release . In the autumn of the same year the Government widened the grounds for the discharge of internees In the course of 1941 the number of releases continued to increase . As a result , by the end of that year only two internment camps remained on the Isle of Man . As late as November 1940 the island had provided nine camps . By July 1942 the number of enemy aliens still detained had diminished to between 300 and 400 and in the course of 1943 and 1944 some of these internees were exchanged in a transfer of personnel between Britain and Germany . By the end of 1944 a hard core of internees alone still of those who remained in the camps until 1945 were refugees who had arrived before 1939 and how many had come into the hands of the British authorities during the course of the war . <p> The implementation of internment and the subsequent sudden run-down of the system deserve further comment . The episode amounted to more than an irrational outbreak of May madness ' . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background to the internment programme . In these circumstances certain departments of state , particularly the War Office and MI5 , developed an increasing power within Whitehall and their influence over policy can be detected . More over , there is no doubt that the decision to intern was assisted by the degree of support it commanded in the country . In particular , it appealed to those groups which in the 1930s had opposed the arrival of refugees from the greater Germany . In other words , internment can be viewed partly as a continuing hostility towards these refugees . <p> But why did the Government suddenly put its policy into reverse ? Evidence on this count is less clear . The sinking of the Arandora Sear off the coast of Ireland on July 2nd , 1940 with the loss of 175 Germans and 486 Italians who were being deported to Canada and the impact of this incident on public opinion , provides one possible influence . The conversion of Churchill to a liberal position which had become evident by the beginning of 1941 must also have helped . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversal of policy still persists . ad the threat of invasion vanished after the Battle of Britain and did xenophobic pressures decline as a consequence ? Did a realisation dawn among policy makers that internment damaged the country 's image ? Was there a growing awareness of the possible utility of the enemy aliens in the war effort ? To use the jargon currently fashionable in Eastern Europe , these are blank spots ' in our understanding . <p> Is it possible to assess the impact of internment upon the enemy alien internees ? As yet our impressions on this question , as on the internment episode in general , must be drawn essentially from the evidence of Austrian and German internees . The experiences of the Italians remain relatively neglected ; indeed , the general history of the Italians in twentieth-century Britain is an underworked terrain . <p> Conditions varied from camp to camp . Kempton Park racecourse , the scene of important National Hunt meetings , became converted into a collecting ground , or transit camp , for Category C aliens and here the Grendier Guards struck a tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lancashire Regiment who guarded the Warth Mills camp near Bury adopted a more relaxed posture . However , all the camps imposed an institutionalised system of arrangements upon their inhabitants which provided a sharp contrast with the freedoms of the wider world . In addition , many of the camps experienced difficulties in accommodating the internees . Sanitary problems became severe at Huyton camp near Liverpool and also in other centres . In short , internees ran into difficulties over which they , in their powerlessness , had little or no control . To be snatched from freedom and then to be confined in one of these camps produced an initial degree of bewilderment or trauma . In the words of one detainee , I remember the first few days . I felt rather done in , I suppose by it all . I felt I could n't eat and had n't much energy . And I remember spending some hours of the day time lying on my couch . ' <p> However , life in the camp also depended upon the activities of the internees . In some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme , the authorities failed to segregate the strong anti-Nazi segments from the smaller number of pro-Nazi aliens who happened to be present in Britain at the time of internment . Problems of a different kind arose from some of those internees who had previously been incarcerated in German concentration camps : these individuals found it particularly difficult to adjust to a new period of confinement in a country where they had hoped to live in freedom . Another group savaged by internment included a number of early immigrants from Galicia who had arrived in Britain before the First World War . Those who had failed to take out British nationality now found themselves detained as enemy aliens as a result of Austria 's control of Galicia before 1918 . A sense of uncomprehending despondency often surrounded these people . Finally , the isolation of internees from friends and family and other mutual support networks created varying degrees of unhappiness for all those who underwent internment . <p> Amidst such darkness , however , brighter gleams of light still penetrated into the camps . A resilient internee at the Hutchinson camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an attempt to keep up spirits . Some camps organised musical concerts . Maryan Maryan and Walter Landauer , both of whom were to become well-known on BBC Radio , often gave recitals to fellow-internees . The internment programme also brought together members of the Amadeus String Quartet . Academic activity , which in some cases assumed the proportions of University Extramural work , also flourished . The artist , Kurt Schwitters , enjoyed a fresh burst of creativity during his internment . Finally , it was during his internment that the young Claus Moser developed his interest in mathematical statistics , a field in which in later years he carved out a major scholarly reputation . In both the short term and the longer term , therefore , the world of the camps had positive as well as negative aspects attaching to its history even if the former were unintended and relied essentially on the initiative of the internees . <p> The reminiscences of those who found themselves confined to the camps provide invaluable testimony on various aspects of camp life . Historians and journalists who have examined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for understandable reasons : it constitutes one of the most pungent examples of insensitivity and intolerance in recent British history . The searing critique presented in November 1940 in Fran , cois Lafitte 's Penguin Special , The Internment of Aliens , remains a reminder of such insensitivity and intolerance . However , those who lived through the experiences of the camps have left a body of testimony which throws considerable light on the capacity of individuals to survive harsh and bitter experiences . A number of examples , culled from their invaluable oral testimony collected together in 1982 by the Imperial War Museum , under the title Britain and the Refugee Crisis 1933-1947 , make this point with great effect . <p> Ludwig Spiro had been born in Trier in 1912 . He came to London in December 1936 . His parents followed him to Britain : they arrived in April 1939 . Spiro was interned in 1940 and spent his internment at the Onchan camp on the Isle of Man . Looking back on the episode he had no intention of whitewashing it but his testimony contained a surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that to me the internment has provided an opportunity of developing my personality in relation to the people around me . I have struck up friendships and got to know people of similar background , whom I would n't have been able to meet , under circumstances which were so revealing and occasionally positive in all this negative atmosphere . I could only think that you make similar experiences , to a very much more advanced degree , in the trenches or under real danger to life . And from that point of view I would n't have wanted to miss it . <p> Spiro 's testimony does not stand alone in its positive qualities . Fritz Hallgarten , born in Winkel near Rudesheim in 1902 , arrived as a refugee in 1933 . Hallgarten , later a well-known wine merchant , found himself interned with other Category C aliens in June 1940 . He spent his period in internment , which lasted until December 1940 , in Hutchinson camp on the Isle of Man . In the Imperial War Museum project the interviewer asked Hallgarten directly , Did internment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in 1940 he had been surprised at his detention . But he tempered this surprise with the observation , . . . we had to beat the Nazis . . . therefore we had to stand by whatever they the British did ' . This lack of bitterness also featured in the testimony of the musician Hans Gal . Born in Vienna in 1890 , Gal came to England from Vienna in 1928 . He was detained in May 1940 . Gal also echoed Spiro in recognising the importance of the internment episode for the development of a number of important friendships . The internment period , incidentally , led to an intensification of Gal 's creative energy , the surviving symbol of which is The Huyton Suite ' . But if anger and bitterness are generally absent , a sense of disappointment can be detected . HeinzSteinert , reflecting on the episode , concluded , one was terribly disappointed and confused really and disheartened that such a thing could happen in a country which we liked and where one hoped one would find refuge ... ' <p> Such evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgement . The dead who went down with the Arandora Star and those detainees who committed suicide are absent from such testimony . Moreover , the recollections of those who survived were compiled many years after internment and memories have a tendency to fade . Likewise , the defeat of Hitlerism might have drawn some of the sting of bitterness from the internees ' minds . It is certainly true that samples of printed material compiled during the period of internment and released recently to the Public Record Office , present gloomier picture of internee responses . Furthermore , even the generally optimistic recollections on the Imperial War Museum tapes sometimes reveal a darker undercurrent . One woman detainee observed , There were people extremely anxious who were crying all the time and who could n't really involve themselves very much and who were ailing all the time because of this . . . In the main I think people adapted . . . but what they thought to themselves in bed at night is a different story . ' However , the positive signs of psychological resistance and personal will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be found in other written material compiled by the internees in the midst of their detention . The Onchan Pioneer , produced at Onchan camp on the Isle of Man , is a powerful testimony to human adaptability and the tenacity to survive . <p> Fiftieth anniversaries are often a time for celebration . Memories which are inconvenient or depressing are usually forgotten . However , in celebrating 1940 as the nation 's and Churchill 's finest hour we need to avoid a dose of celebratory excess . One of the most widely-promoted myths in British history relates to the nation 's toleration of its ethnic and racial minorities . The internment episode , which involved the pursuit of enemy aliens by a considerable cross-section of the British public and the state , with the intention of reducing such groups to a condition of powerlessness , is one of a number of developments which deflate that celebratory myth . <p> There is more to this hostility which requires emphasis . Britain found itself at war between 1939 and 1945 with a country which had become identified as a major centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of wartime Britain . Indeed , this brand of antipathy can be detected among some of those who campaigned for internment . Such sentiment constitutes one reminder of the persistence and tenacity of anti-Semitism in Britain . <p> This reflection leads to another . Ethnic and racial minorities are often accused of being ultra-sensitive to criticism and of dwelling on the hostility they encounter . The internment episode reveals the necessity for such groups to be constantly on the alert . In the early months of 1940 existing currents of pro-refugee sentiment suddenly evaporated . This development reveals the extent to which the history of minorities is capable of sudden shifts of direction in response to wider , immediate pressures . <p> Finally , building upon this observation , the internment episode needs to be related to the debate on civil liberties in wartime . Many individuals who remained active in the Fascist movement in Britain found themselves imprisoned under Regulation 18 B. Workers laboured under a tight system of controls so the the State could extract from them the last ounce of effort during the war . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in circumstances of great threat or adversity , and particularly during times of war , the liberal state can move quickly and decisively to diminish the freedom of individuals and groups living under its jurisdiction .
