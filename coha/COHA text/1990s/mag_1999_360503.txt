As with Ellis ' American Psycho , what stabs out at you here  --  more than the violence , gratuitous sex and endless references to famous people and clothes  --  is the novel 's length . The idea  --  models so solipsistic that they become terrorists  --  is a good-enough one for a short story of 15 pages , but it 's unsustainable at 482 . Ellis ' writing can be sharp , though , and after the first inanely repetitive 185 pages , the book succeeds in delivering a creepy sense of dread about our culture . Glamorama 's contribution to the world may be the motto of its main character , a male model : The better you look , the more you see . As a sum-up of our decade , it 's downright Tom Wolfean . <P>  --  By Joel Stein
