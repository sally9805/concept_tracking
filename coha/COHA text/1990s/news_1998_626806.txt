<p> WASHINGTON - With his presidency at risk , President Clinton reversed course Monday and acknowledged engaging in sex with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky , then apologized publicly for a relationship that he denied under oath earlier this year . <p> " I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate . In fact , it was wrong , " the president said in a televised address after more than four hours of grand jury testimony . But he said that he never urged anyone to lie or cover up the affair . <p> The president 's admission , first made during the unprecedented testimony before a federal grand jury , apparently did not satisfy independent counsel Kenneth Starr , who is preparing a report for Congress outlining what could be impeachable offenses . <p> Starr notified Clinton 's legal team that he was reserving the right to seek additional testimony from the president after he provided only general acknowledgment of a sexual affair , then refused to provide details sought by prosecutors of the kind of contact he had with Lewinsky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence about this matter gave a false impression . I misled people , including even my wife . I deeply regret that , " Clinton said in his public comments . He is the first president to testify before a grand jury investigating his conduct . <p> Clinton said his trysts with Lewinsky " constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible . " <p> Clinton said he was truthful when answering questions posed by Starr and his deputies , who have been investigating whether the president lied about Lewinsky , urged others to lie and tried to obstruct justice with a series of legal maneuvers to block the grand jury inquiry . <p> Late Monday , the president 's private lawyer , David E. Kendall , issued a statement saying the president " made the painful admission " of carrying on an affair with Lewinsky . " As to a very few , highly intrusive questions , with respect to the specifics of this contact ( with Lewinsky ) , in order to preserve personal privacy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not detailed , answers . " <p> In his speech to a television audience , Clinton said he wanted to put the issue behind him . " This matter is between me , the two people I love most - my wife and our daughter - and our God , " the president said . " I must put it right , and I am prepared to do whatever it takes to do so . " <p> It is time " to stop the prying into private lives and get on with our national life , " Clinton said . <p> " Our country has been distracted by this matter for too long , and I take my responsibility for my part in all of this , " he said . " Now it is time - in fact , it is past time , to move on . It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into private lives and get on with our national life . " <p> Clinton said he did not come forward earlier because he was trying to save himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The president 's testimony from the White House Map Room was viewed at the federal courthouse by the 23-member grand jury on two television sets . The closed-circuit broadcast was wired to the spacious courtroom of Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson rather than the more confining room where the grand jury normally meets . Reporters were kept 80 feet from the courtroom entrance . <p> After the session with Starr , Clinton huddled with his legal team and political advisers , then issued his televised apology from the Map Room . Aides said he began drafting those remarks early Monday . <p> Clinton 's strategists were counting on a candid accounting by the president to appease most Americans . Polls through the weekend indicated citizens continued to give Clinton high marks for his job performance and might be willing to let the Lewinsky matter slip if he apologized . <p> Starr left the White House without comment . At the courthouse , his spokesman , Charles Bakaly , indicated the investigation of the president and the intern was drawing to a close . " We 're continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete the investigation as fairly and as efficiently as we can and that 's what we 're going to do , " Bakaly told reporters . <p> Grand jurors were expected to gather again today . Possible witnesses include Lewinsky , presidential secretary Betty Currie and deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsey , a longtime friend and confidant of Clinton . <p> Lewinsky , who was 21 when her affair with Clinton began , reportedly told the grand jury of a dozen White House sexual encounters with the president over an 18-month period . She also told how they discussed " cover stories " to keep their relationship secret , but she said Clinton never urged her to lie under oath . <p> In January , Lewinsky and the president both denied under oath that they engaged in sex . Their statements were made in response to subpoenas issued in Paula Jones ' sexual harassment suit against Clinton . <p> Lewinsky changed her story after six months of pressure from Starr . She agreed to cooperate with his investigation in return for immunity from prosecution and testified before the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger legally extends beyond his admission of sex if Starr continues pushing to establish possible evidence of obstruction of justice . <p> Still under scrutiny by Starr are efforts by Clinton associates to get Lewinsky a job , which prosecutors have indicated is a sign that a cover-up was under way . Lewinsky also reportedly told the grand jury that Clinton told her that if they both deny having sex , no one could prove it . <p> Lewinsky told grand jurors that she returned to the White House several gifts he had given her , after he suggested it . She addressed the packages , again at Clinton 's suggestion , to Currie , Lewinsky reportedly testified . <p> Before meeting with prosecutors Monday , the president gave aides a rough draft of the public remarks he planned to deliver and directed them to postpone until today his departure for Martha 's Vineyard , the Massachusetts island where he plans to vacation with his wife and their 18-year-old daughter , Chelsea . <p> Late Sunday , Clinton met with the Rev. Jesse Jackson , a prominent civil rights leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he went to the White House after he was summoned by Chelsea . Jackson said he met with the first lady and Chelsea , then the three of them talked briefly with the president . <p> " Fortunately for him , they are greeting him with open arms and devotion , " Jackson said . " I mean face it , he ( Clinton ) is embarrassed by whatever happened , however one defines inappropriate , and Hillary has had to face the humiliation of it all . But then , she is mature and they are in love and their marriage will survive this . " <p> Sen. John Ashcroft , a Missouri Republican who is considering a presidential bid in 2000 , said Clinton 's admission should not mean he should remain in office . " It should be the basis for his resignation , " Ashcroft said . " If he has subverted the truth , if there are the serious crimes of perjury , the Congress has a responsibility to impeach . " <p> " I think the president should be forgiven , but the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashcroft said . " It 's not incompatible to forgive the president and want to see justice here . " <p> Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , reacted angrily to Clinton 's television remarks , in which he expressed distrust for Starr and his inquiry . " Was n't that pathetic ? I tell you , what a jerk , " Hatch said . " That 's the biggest mistake he 's ever made . " <p> Earlier he said : " I do n't see how he can possibly hide behind ' It 's consensual . ' The most powerful man in the world and a 21-year-old intern . Consensual or not , it 's still abysmal , if it happened . " <p> Democratic National Committee Chairman Roy Romer , the Colorado governor , said people want to see the investigation wrapped up so the government can focus instead on substantive issues such as Social Security and health care . <p> " People are saying : ' Get this out of the way so we can get to the business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Denver .
