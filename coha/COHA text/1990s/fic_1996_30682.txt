Chapter One &lt; I do n't think the elephant is going to work , " Oliver Rain finally said . His soft , dark voice was shaded with polite regret . " I was afraid you would n't like him . " Annie Lyncroft gazed morosely at the beast and wondered how to broach the real subject she wanted to discuss with the inscrutable Oliver Rain . " I 'll admit he 's unusual , " Rain acknowledged . " You 're probably asking yourself the same question that a lot of my clients ask . You 're wondering , Is it art or is it just plain tacky ? " " An interesting question , " Rain conceded . " Keep in mind that the elephant is functional as well as ornamental , " Annie said in an instinctive , last-ditch effort to salvage the sale . " There 's a little hidden drawer in the base . Very useful for small objects . " " I do n't think he fits into this room , " Rain said diplomatically . Annie wondered privately if anything except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gold , and gray study . She had been almost certain Rain would n't like the elephant . The two-foot-high cloisonn figure with its scarlet toenails and purple trunk looked cheerfully ridiculous standing next to Rain 's Zen rock garden . The garden , which occupied a large corner of the study , was not a true garden , at least not to Annie 's way of thinking . It contained no hint of green . Not a single leaf , let alone any colorful blooms , marred the pristine perfection of the pearl gray sand . The sand was encased in a low black wooden frame . It had been meticulously raked into abstract designs around five rocks . Annie suspected Rain had spent hours contemplating exactly where to put the rocks on the sand . It was undoubtedly just the sort of emotionless problem in aesthetics that would appeal to him . The designer whom Rain had hired to do the interiors of the spacious new twenty-sixth-floor suite had sized up her client with unerring accuracy . All the rooms afforded seemingly endless views of Seattle , Elliott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in the same forbidding tones of ebony , gold , and gray that dominated the study . The end result was an austere , elegant lair perfectly suited to a man whom many people considered to be a dangerous predator . No , Annie decided , the elephant was a handsome creature , but he certainly did n't fit into the disciplined , restrained decor of Rain 's newly completed suite . She could not imagine anything from her boutique full of wildly whimsical one-of-a-kind items that would look right here . Oliver Rain was clearly not much given to whimsy of any kind . " I 'm sorry the elephant is n't quite right , " Rain murmured . " Do n't worry about it . I did n't think it would work . To tell you the truth , I have n't been able to interest any of my clients in him . " Annie frowned . " Something about that elephant seems to put people off . I wonder if it 's the toenails . " " Quite possibly . " " Well , it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephant on Oliver Rain . " You insisted I bring something else by , so I decided to try him out in here . " " Very kind of you . I appreciate your perseverance . Let me pour you some more tea . " Rain reached for the black-and-gold-enameled teapot that sat on the nearby black lacquer tray . Annie watched , fascinated , as he refilled her cup . The bright white cone of light from the halogen lamp on his desk revealed the sinewy strength of his hands . Rain 's hands were not those of an ordinary business executive . They were rough , even calloused in places , as if he made his fortune working in rich soil rather than in giltedged investments . He managed to imbue the delicate act of pouring tea with a riveting masculinity . Each motion was one of disciplined strength and grace . Annie had learned that any movement Rain made , no matter how small , captured her full attention . Perhaps it was because each ripple of restrained power stood in such stark contrast to the vast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving . Annie had never met a man who was so completely in control of himself . She eyed him warily as she accepted the teacup from him . " To be perfectly honest , I do n't think I have anything in Wildest Dreams that will suit you . " Rain contemplated her as if she presented a curious but not unsolvable dilemma . " Just because the elephant does n't work , I do n't think we should assume that nothing else from your shop will work , either . " " You did n't like the carousel I brought on Monday , " Annie reminded him . " Ah , yes , the carousel . I 'll admit it had a certain charm , but somehow the rather bizarre creatures on it seemed wrong in here . " " Depends on your point of view , I suppose , " Annie muttered . Personally , she thought the beautifully gilded carousel with its collection of strange mythological animals had been a nice touch in a room that already contained the eminently unusual , near-mythic Oliver Rain . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the case with most legends , she reflected . The fewer facts available , the more legendary the man became in the eyes of the world . She had first met him six weeks ago at her brother Daniel 's engagement party . She had known of his existence , of course , because Daniel had once worked for him . But she and Rain had never been introduced . Daniel Lyncroft was an acknowledged genius in the field of electronics . Five years ago he had been hired by Rain to set up several high-tech security systems for Rain 's extensive business empire . Later , when Daniel had left to start his own electronics firm , Rain had invested heavily in the start-up operation , thus becoming Daniel 's single biggest financial backer . Daniel had warned Annie that , although Rain had been invited to attend the engagement party , he was unlikely to appear . Oliver Rain was almost never seen in public , let alone at social affairs . Furthermore , if he ever did decide to move in society , it would almost certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyncrofts occupied . The Rain fortune , which Oliver Rain had rebuilt from scratch after the mysterious disappearance of his father , was as much the stuff of legend as the man himself . But to Daniel 's obvious surprise and pleasure , Rain had turned up at the engagement party in the back of a black limousine . He had been dressed in stark black and white evening wear . The formal clothes had emphasized the dark , fierce stillness in him . Annie had been enthralled by Rain from the moment she first saw him . He was unlike any other man she had ever known . There was a haunting aura of power , passion , and pride about him , but overlaying it all was an iron-clad self-control . It was intriguing to watch the way people slipped unobtrusively out of Rain 's way as he moved through the chic restaurant Daniel had rented for the occasion . She understood the impulse . There was no doubt but that the man radiated a potential for danger . He prowled through the throng of well-wishers like a leopard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small part of Annie wanted to flee to safer ground . A much larger , louder part urged her to get closer to Oliver Rain regardless of the risks . Annie had concluded that Rain held the same sort of attraction for her as did the unusual objects she sold in her boutique , Wildest Dreams . He was not handsome in the conventional sense , but she found him utterly compelling . Something deep within her reacted to his presence with an acute sense of awareness . When he looked at her the fine hair on the nape of her neck stirred . That night at Daniel 's party , Annie had secretly memorized everything about Oliver Rain from the color of his eyes , which were an illusive , indescribable shade of gray , to the controlled impassivity of his features . He wore his black hair much too long for a business executive . It would have brushed his shoulders if he had not tied it back in a low ponytail . His grim , harsh face betrayed an implacable , unbending willpower . The icy hint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence in his gaze led Annie to conclude that Rain was very close to forty . This was a man who would never rely on his looks or his charm to get what he wanted in life , she decided . He would simply reach out and take it . Rain had stayed at the party for less than half an hour . Except for the brief time that he spent with Daniel and the few minutes it had taken to introduce him to Daniel 's fiance , Joanna , and to Annie , he had held himself apart from the crowd . He had stood alone , occupying a space that no one else dared violate and sipped champagne while the guests ebbed and flowed around him . Annie had been intensely aware of his eyes following her when she danced with some of Daniel 's friends , but Rain had not asked her to join him on the floor . He had not danced with anyone at all . When Oliver Rain quietly left the party , Annie experienced a strange disappointment . The small ember of unfamiliar sensual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived flickered out when he departed . She surreptitiously watched from a window as Daniel escorted Rain out to the waiting limousine . The two men spent a few minutes talking quietly in the drive . When the conversation ended , Rain glanced at the window where Annie stood as if he had known all along she was watching . He acknowledged her with a small , almost courtly inclination of his head . Then he got into the limousine and vanished into the rain-streaked night . " He 's an interesting but rather dangerous man , " Daniel said to Annie later . " You never know for certain what he 's thinking . I do n't believe he trusts anyone . When I worked for him , he was almost obsessive about maintaining files on all key employees and the people with whom he did business . " " Files ? " " More like security dossiers . " Daniel 's mouth curved wryly . " He always claimed that personal inside information on people was what he relied on to give him the edge . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man like that , " Annie said thoughtfully . " He would want to be in control at all times . " " The thing to remember about Oliver Rain is that he 's always got his own agenda , and he never lets anyone else know what that agenda is until he 's ready . He 's a lone wolf , not a team player . " " Is he a gangster ? " Annie asked , horrified at the possibility that her brother might be in debt to a criminal . Daniel grinned . " If he is , he 's smart enough to bury the bodies so deep that no one will ever find them . " " Why on earth did you let him back you if you do n't trust him ? " Daniel looked at her in surprise . " I never said I did n't trust him . I just said he was dangerous . " " There 's a difference ? " " A big difference . " Annie hugged herself against the small shiver that went through her . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , even though I worked for him . The man 's a legend . " " Why ? " Annie asked . " Fifteen years ago his father walked out on the family . Just vanished . I do n't know the whole story , but I do know that a few months before he disappeared Edward Rain had persuaded some of his friends to invest in one of his development projects . " " Let me guess , " Annie said . " The investors ' money vanished along with Rain ? " " Right . Not only that , but Edward Rain had liquidated most of his own personal assets . He took that cash with him , too . The family was left with virtually nothing except a mountain of debts . " I 'll ve heard tales of that kind of thing happening . There was a story in the papers just the other day about a prominent banker who simply got on a plane with several million dollars and was never seen again . He left his family and his whole life behind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Annie stared at her brother . " What happened ? " " Oliver paid off all of his father 's debts within two years , " Daniel said . There was cool admiration in his voice . " He rebuilt his father 's fortune from scratch . It 's now far larger than it was before Edward Rain disappeared , which should tell you something about Oliver . " " Poor Oliver , " Annie whispered . " He must have been emotionally devastated when his father vanished . " Daniel frowned in alarm . " Now , Annie ... " " The shame and humiliation would have been intolerable to a man like that , " Annie continued thoughtfully . " He 's obviously been scarred for life . No wonder he 's not very outgoing . " " Hold it right there , " Daniel ordered . " Don " t even think about it . " " About what ? " Annie asked innocently . " About trying to rescue Oliver Rain . He is definitely not another wounded stray male you can add to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Everyone needs to be rescued at one time or another , Daniel . " " Not Rain , " Daniel said flatly . " That man can take care of himself . Trust me . " Annie did not see or hear from Rain again until two weeks later . He had called the day after Daniel 's private plane went down in the ocean on a flight to Alaska . That had been a month ago in October . Rain had asked her very gently if she needed help of any kind . Caught up in the chaos of the situation , struggling to deal with reporters and the authorities who were conducting the search-and-rescue operation , as well as trying to console Joanna , Annie had been tense and distracted . She had brusquely told Oliver Rain that she did not need his assistance . It was only as she hung up the phone that she belatedly recalled the fact that Rain was her brother 's chief creditor . Now that Daniel had disappeared , Rain was a potential threat . If he chose to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fledgling company lacked leadership , Lyncroft Unlimited would go under . There was simply no way to pay off Oliver Rain at this point . But it was n't Rain who had turned out to be the immediate threat . It was a coalition of suppliers and the other investors , all of whom panicked when they realized that Daniel was no longer at the helm of his company . Barry Cork , Daniel 's trusted assistant , did the best he could to reassure everyone that business was going on as usual , but no one believed him . A few days later Rain had called again . " Perhaps we had better talk , " he said quietly . " About what ? " Annie demanded , knowing full well what he wanted to discuss . " Lyncroft 's future . " " Lyncroft is doing just fine , thank you . Barry Cork has everything under control . My brother will be rescued any day now , and everything will go back to normal . " " I 'm sorry , Ms. Lyncroft , but you must face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't believe that and neither does his fiance . We 're going to hold Lyncroft together until he returns . " Annie gripped the phone cord and tried to keep her voice calm and confident . " I appreciate your concern , but nothing has changed at the company . Everything 's under control . " " I see . " There was a long silence on the line . " I hear rumors that some of your brother 's other creditors are starting to press for a sale or merger . " " Nonsense . Strictly rumors . I 've explained to all ofthem that things are fine and that we expect Daniel to return soon . " There was another thoughtful silence . " As you wish . Please feel free to call me if the other investors become difficult . I might be able to help you . " Annie had hung up the phone feeling more uneasy than ever . Lyncroft Unlimited was a family-owned corporation . No one except family members could hold stock in the firm . Daniel had been intent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were only two members of the Lyncroft family , Annie and her brother . That made Annie Daniel 's sole inheritor . Two weeks ago Rain had again contacted her . Instead of talking about the fate of Lyncroft Unlimited , he had explained that he was requesting her services in a professional capacity . He wanted her to provide the finishing touches for the rooms in his new penthouse . Annie was still not quite sure why she had accepted the job . She certainly had more than enough to do without taking time out of her frantic days to provide personal consultation to a client . But today was her fourth visit to the twenty-sixth floor of the downtown Seattle high rise . Thus far it had followed the same pattern as the previous visits . It was n't easy getting to Oliver Rain . First , she had to get past the doorman in the lobby of the building . There was a special code that had to be punched into the elevator control panel in order to get to the twenty-sixth floor . When she arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robot of a man known only as Bolt . He appeared to be a combination of butler and chauffeur . Annie wondered if he was also a bodyguard . In his own way , Bolt was almost as interesting as his employer . He looked to be somewhere in his early fifties . Every time Annie had seen him he had been wearing a formal dark suit . His pale blue eyes betrayed no emotion of any kind . His thinning hair was razored to within a quarter of an inch all over his head . There was a mechanical quality about Bolt that made Annie wonder if he was part machine . She had visions of him plugging himself into an electrical outlet each night to recharge his batteries . She got the distinct impression he did not approve of her . On that first visit , Bolt had shown her into the study with a minimum of words . Tea had been brought in on a tray . Annie had waited nervously for Rain to bring up the subject of her missing brother , but he had proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the first consultation Annie had begun to look forward to these quiet , serene interludes . During the time she was safely secluded here in Rain 's study , drinking his exotic , aromatic tea and talking of unimportant things such as cloisonn elephants and gilded carousels , she could put aside her fears and problems . It was a relief because those fears and problems were rapidly turning into nightmares . She had not forgotten what Daniel had said about Rain being dangerous , but she was finding it increasingly impossible to be afraid of him . There was something oddly reassuring about his strength . She found herself consciously trying to absorb some of it during these afternoon sessions in his study . " It 's obviously going to take some time to come up with just the right additional element for this room , " Rain said with one last glance at the elephant . " But I 'm a patient man . I 'm certain we 'll find something sooner or later . " " I doubt it , " Annie said . Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously does n't run to the kind of stuff I sell . My philosophy is that every room needs a jarring note . A beautiful interior needs a colorful touch of ugliness . A serene interior needs an object that clashes . A cluttered interior needs an element of order . " Rain did n't smile , which was hardly surprising , but a subtle change in his mist-colored eyes told her he was amused . She had only spent a few afternoons with him , but she was getting quite good at reading the small signals that indicated his moods . He was not an unemotional man , she realized , but somewhere along the line he had learned to exert an astounding degree of control over his emotions . " I 'm not concerned about the differences in our taste when it comes to elephants and carousels , " Rain said softly . He fell silent , sipping his tea with a reflective air . Silences were common around Oliver Rain . They did not appear to bother him , but Annie found them unnerving . She herself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation . She swallowed tea and wondered if this was the moment to bring up the topic she wanted to discuss . Perhaps she should wait another week or so , but she was afraid she could not put it off much longer . Time was running out . If she could not get Rain to go along with her wild plan to save Lyncroft Unlimited , she would have to regroup and come up with another idea . Unfortunately she did n't think there were any other ideas . She was at the end of the line . Annie 's stomach tightened as she steeled herself . Very carefully she replaced her teacup on its black and gold saucer . " Mr. Rain ... " " Oliver . Please . I want you to think of me as a friend of the family . " " Oliver . " Annie took a deep breath . " A month ago , right after my brother disappeared , you said something about giving us , Joanna and me , that is , a hand . " " I assume there is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " Annie admitted . The search-and-rescue operation had been called off three days after Daniel 's plane had vanished . There had been no sign of either the wreckage or of her brother 's body to date . The official verdict was that Daniel had been lost at sea . " And now , at last , you 're beginning to understand the difficulties you 'll face if you continue to try to run Lyncroft Unlimited on your own , " Oliver said calmly . Annie met his cool gaze . " It 's going to be impossible , is n't it ? " " Yes . " " You knew that all along , did n't you ? " Oliver shrugged slightly . " It was inevitable that there would be serious problems . Your brother was the driving force behind Lyncroft Unlimited . Everyone knows that . With him gone , the investors were bound to get restless . " Annie gripped the arm of the black lacquer chair . " The other investors and creditors invited me to a meeting two days ago . They gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell or merge Lyncroft with a major firm very soon , they 're going to call in the outstanding debt . " " I 'm aware of the meeting . " Annie wrinkled her nose . " I 'm not surprised . " She paused . " You were n't at it , though . " " No . " " Does that mean you do n't think I should agree to a buyout or a merger ? " Annie held her breath waiting for the answer . " I did n't say that . A buyout may be for the best . It will keep the company alive so that it will have a chance to get your brother 's new wireless technology to market . When that happens , everyone involved will recover his initial investment along with a considerable profit . " Daniel 's inventions were in the hot new area of electronics that was revolutionizing everything from computerized inventory control systems to medical procedures . Daniel had often told Annie the office of the future would be " wireless . " The electrical cords that currently chained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanish . " I ca n't sell Daniel 's firm . " Annie curled her hands into small determined fists . " He 's worked too hard to get it started . He 's invested everything he has in it , not just his money but his sweat and his genius . The future in electronics is in this new wireless stuff , and he 's going to be in on the ground floor . Do n't you understand ? I ca n't give it away . " Oliver 's black lashes veiled his eyes . " You wo n't be giving it away . You can demand a very good price . There are a lot of firms in the industry that would give a great deal to get their hands on the new technology your brother was developing . " " I wo n't sell Daniel 's company , " Annie repeated . " Not as long as Joanna and I believe there 's a possibility he may still be alive . " " One of these days you will have to take a more realistic view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Daniel is gone . You know that as well as I do . " Annie lifted her chin . " I would know if Daniel were dead . " " Would you ? " " Yes , I would , damn it . Daniel is the only family I 've got , the only family I 've had since Aunt Madeline died . I 'd know if he were really gone forever . " She stabbed her fingers through her wild thick bob of sherry-colored curls . " I 'd feel it deep inside . " Surely she would know it . Would n't she ? Annie knew she was getting close to the end of her rope . She had n't had a single good night 's sleep since Daniel had vanished . The initial shock had faded somewhat , but her secret fears sometimes escaped from the dark place where she managed to confine them most of the time . When they did , they nearly swamped her . Perhaps her beloved older brother really was dead . She was exhausted . There had been too many decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions to answer , too much pressure from the people who had invested in her brother 's company . And now that Joanna had told her about the baby , there was a whole new set of concerns to be faced . " I 'm not the only one who would know if Daniel were dead , " Annie continued quietly . " Joanna feels as strongly about this as I do . We 're both certain he 's still alive . " " No one can survive in that water off the coast of Alaska for more than thirty or forty minutes , " Oliver reminded her gently . " You know that . " " The thing that everyone seems to forget is that my brother was a certified genius . Furthermore , when he flew , he took precautions other people would n't bother to take . He carried a survival suit , for example . And a raft . And all kinds of equipment . " " Even a survival suit wo n't protect a person against hypothermia indefinitely . " " There are dozens of islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just little dots of land . He could have made it to any one of them . He would be able to survive on one until help arrived . " " The search-and-rescue operation was very thorough , " Oliver said . " I made certain of it . " Annie widened her eyes . " You did ? " " Of course . I told you , Daniel was more than a trusted employee when he worked for me . He was a friend . " " I 'm glad to hear that , " Annie said grimly . " Because I 've come to ask you for help . I 'm hoping that your friendship with Daniel was strong enough that you 'll agree to my plan . " Oliver studied her with an expression of subdued satisfaction . He had clearly been expecting this . " You want me to give you a buyout offer for the company . " " No . " Annie shot to her feet and stalked to the floor-to-ceiling windows . She looked out at the slatecolored sky and gray waters of Elliott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want . I told you , I wo n't sell Lyncroft Unlimited . Not if I can help it . " " I would be willing to agree to sell it back to your brother if he does reappear . " Annie glanced back over her shoulder . " That 's generous of you , but I do n't think it 's such a good idea . " " Why not ? " She set her back teeth . " Because I have it on very good authority that you are a dangerous man , Oliver Rain . " He did not seem disconcerted by the news . " Is that right ? Who told you that ? " " Daniel . " " Your brother always was rather intelligent . " " Right . A genius . Look , we both know that if I were to sell the company to you , I would lose control of it entirely . You could do anything you want with it . You might even refuse to sell it back to Daniel or if you did , you might put such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to afford it . " " We could arrange the terms of the deal before you sign anything . " " I just do n't like letting go of the company . Not even to you . The risk is too great . No offense , but frankly , I do n't see anyone in his right mind surrendering rights to the kind of technology Daniel has created . " " I applaud your loyalty and determination . But in the meantime , you 're under a lot of pressure from your brother 's creditors . They can force you to sell or merge , Annie . " " I know . " Annie closed her eyes briefly and then swung around to face him . " They 've started to call every day . After that meeting two days ago I knew we were in real trouble . " " It was only a matter of time . They 're running scared , Annie . Surely you see their position . Lyncroft Unlimited is a one-man company in all the ways that count and that one man has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All I need is a little time . " " How much time ? " " That 's just it , I have no idea . A few days or maybe weeks . Who knows how long it will take to find Daniel ? " Oliver took a slow , thoughtful sip of tea and set the cup down on its saucer . Annie followed the movement with her eyes . The delicate china looked very fragile in his powerful hands . But it also looked quite safe . " Even if I give you all the time you wish , you ca n't hope to stave off the rest of the firm 's creditors for long , " Oliver said . " Not by myself , no . I realize that . But they would be pacified if they thought the company was in good hands again . Everyone realizes that I do n't know beans about electronics and neither does Joanna . Nor do we know anything about managing a company the size of Lyncroft . " " No , " Rain agreed . " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if an executive who had a brilliant reputation in the business world were to take the helm , I think we could hold off the investors indefinitely . " Oliver did not move , but there was an air of cool readiness about him now . " ' You 're thinking of hiring someone to manage the company for you ? " " Sort of . " " I suppose it 's a possibility . Have you approached anyone yet ? " " I had Barry Cork make a couple of discreet inquiries , " Annie admitted . " He says the problem is that the people he approached all said they would n't do it unless they were guaranteed a permanent chunk of the company as part of their payment . " " That 's a reasonable demand in such a situation . But you do n't want to give away even a piece of Lyncroft Unlimited , do you ? " " No , I do n't dare . Daniel probably would n't be able to get it back when he returns . Lyncroft Unlimited is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in five years . Everyone in the industry is aware of its potential . " " If you take on a partner now , Daniel will be stuck with him later , is that what you 're afraid of ? " " Exactly . Partners can be major problems . Daniel told me once he never wanted one . " " You must understand that you have only two options at the moment . You can sell or merge Daniel 's firm or you can take on a partner who can run it for you . " " I just ca n't take the chance , " Annie said . " Daniel might never get back full control of his company . " Oliver reached for the teapot . " I 'm sure I can be of some assistance , Annie . " Relief soared through her . " That was exactly what I was hoping you would say . " Oliver slanted her a speculative glance . " Were you ? " " Yes . The way I see it , you 've got a lot at stake here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests for my brother 's company to survive and get its products into production , right ?

" " Well , I 've come up with an option that will give both of us what we want . " " Have you ? " He sounded skeptical , but he was clearly intrigued . " Yes , I have . It will protect Daniel 's company and it will also protect your investment . " Annie hurried back to her chair and sat down . Now that the moment had arrived to explain her idea , she was no longer so nervous . She leaned forward intently and folded her arms on the polished surface of the ebony desk . " I 'm listening , Annie . " " This is a little difficult to explain , " she said . " But if you 'll just hear me out , I think you 'll agree that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be in effect very long because I 'm sure we 'll find Daniel any day . " Oliver paused in the act of pouring more tea . " This grows more interesting by the moment . Let " s hear your plan . " " Okay , as you know , Lyncroft Unlimited is a family-held corporation . My brother and I control all of the stock . When Joanna marries Daniel , she 'll receive shares in the company , too , but not before that time . " " I understand . But since she has n't yet married and your brother and Daniel is presumed dead , you now control all of the stock . You 're the only member of the Lyncroft family around at the moment . " " That 's right . " Annie gathered herself for the plunge . " ' But if I were to marry , my husband would become a member of the family . I could give him an interest in the company . " Tea splashed on the surface of the ebony desk . Oliver abruptly set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small puddle of spilled tea as if amazed that his powerful hands had failed him . When he looked up again , his eyes were filled with frozen ice . " I did n't know you were planning to marry anyone . " Annie waved that aside . " I 'm not . Not exactly , that is . Mr. Rain , I mean , Oliver , have you ever heard of a marriage of convenience ? "
