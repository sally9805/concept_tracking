ON THE MORNING his son was born , Denny McCready walked out to the banks of the Chesapeake to see the dawn . As a farmer does on his endless spirals , lost in meditation to the tractor 's unwavering drone , he had been picturing and repicturing this moment for some months . Just as he had imagined , the first yellow light dappling the water was full of promise ; he could breathe in the textured Bay air and smell the sharp fragrance of the honeysuckle growing along the fence lines behind him . But his heart was not suddenly filled with the majesty of it all . He looked down at his stained hands , resting without task at his side , and they reminded him of season after season , drought followed by too much rain , sickness and health . He took one last glance across the water to Hail Point , a fragile stand of loblolly pines slowly being undermined by the tides and storms , and then he turned , feeling almost as if his love had been found insufficient even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Denny began to feel better when he settled in on the telephone , working through the list of friends and family that Susan had prepared weeks ago . On his way through the farmyard he had stopped by the milking parlor , found his father and the hired man , and received a round of congratulations , pats on the back . The baby was named Charles after Denny 's father . The sun-creased scowl on the old man 's face relaxed for a time into a smoother reflection of satisfaction : it was right for a man to have children , and grandchildren , just as it was right for a farmer to have a dog . The moment was over fairly quickly  --  it was time to move the milkers to the cows on the other aisle  --  but as Denny left the others to their labors , he looked back with the sensation that these familiar routines were no longer his , that his life had now slipped slightly out of his control . <p> A few hours later , showered and shaved , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings of fatigue , but she had demanded the baby and he lay at her side . <p> " I do n't know how you could sleep at a time like this , " she said , assuming that he had . Denny 's big round face seemed to eclipse the sun at her window ; she could smell the farm on his clothes , a pungent sweetness in contrast to all these metallic fumes . It seemed odd , and wonderful to her , that the future of this rough and self-reliant man would now be softened by a child . <p> He did not want to tell her about visiting the rivershore . " Why did I have to call Jack Hammond ? " he asked . " He seemed surprised and not happy to be woke up . " <p> " He 's your uncle , " she said . <p> " My uncle ? I have n't seen him since before we graduated . I had to tell him my last name . " <p> " Shh . " She looked down at the small bundle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rash , shrouded in a light blue blanket . The baby 's eyes were now closed , and when the nurse came in and took him to be checked over by the pediatrician he was so firmly bound in his blanket that he looked stiff , like a mummy . <p> " Why are you being so ornery ? " Susan asked when they were alone . <p> He wondered why , and he looked around this hospital room , pleasant by any standard he could think of , a whiteness that spoke of hope and a busy hum that sounded like rest . He looked at Susan , drifting off in this borrowed bed ; she seemed as haggard and puffy as his mother had when she was dying of cancer , perhaps even in this very same room , nearly ten years earlier . He had the sudden feeling that for families as well as hospital rooms , birth and death were really the same thing . He banished these thoughts , wondering what was next and why it was taking so long , and then the door opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had a sort of pleased look on his face , as if he had just been proven right . When Susan was again alert , the doctors told them that the boy had cystic fibrosis , that his insides and lungs were already plugged , that he might not survive the week , and if he did he would probably not live long enough to enter kindergarten . The doctors  --  even the smug one  --  said it kindly , over the period of an hour or so , but that is what they said . <p> For the first months of his son 's life , Denny could barely bring himself to touch him . He heard air passing through those small lips and pictured his lungs as blackened ruins dripping with tar . He watched Susan happily nursing the boy , passing her hand over the smooth contours of his silky head , luxuriating in the weight of the child in her arms . It surprised him that she seemed , at these moments , so satisfied with her baby , despite all that awaited them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , he usually found Susan and the baby in the kitchen . Sometimes , even before he entered the house , he could hear the deep jarring thud , thud , thud , of Susan 's firm hands on the baby 's back , the prescribed regimen for loosening what Denny thought of as the crusts and plugs of tar . The boy never seemed to mind this ; Susan had learned how to drive the blow through the small body , and not to let it hit with a slap on his skin . But even so , Susan always ended the procedure by rubbing and massaging him , which made him giggle and coo . In time it became part of a sensuality between them , a kind of game , starting her hand down for one more blow , stopping just short and then folding into a caress , her broad palms covering his entire back . When Charlie had begun to talk , he said to his mother , " Smooth me , " and Denny watched , almost embarrassed , as she passed her flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his body . <p> Back when Charlie was still a newborn , when the first untroubled and unknowing smiles began to appear , Denny prayed that this could all happen quickly , before he gave too much of his love , before he surrendered too much of his hope . It took almost to the end of Charlie 's life for Denny to realize that this prayer was monstrous , that he had asked for an end of his own pain in the place of a cure for his son . Susan would make him pay for this . But by then Denny had also learned that of all the pain a human can endure , not allowing oneself to feel love is the worst ; that denying love to oneself can destroy , from the inside . <p> In the hospital , during what they had all finally decided would be his last hours or days , Denny sat beside Charlie while Susan went home to eat and perhaps to cry in the solitude of the shower . Charlie was awake , naked except for a diaper , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat easily and his eyes were at rest on his father . Denny reached over to take his hand and then began to stroke his small chest , running his fingertips around the cushioned indent of his nipples . Charlie smiled and closed his eyes halfway . " Smooth me , Daddy , " he said . <p> " You okay ? " he asked . " Can you breathe good ? " <p> " Smooth me , please . " <p> Denny dropped his hand down to the flat , starved stomach , to the navel that had been opened too wide by the poisons concocted from his parents ' mingled blood . Charlie held still for those hands , rough and work-stained as they were , as Denny traced the lines of his body . " This is what it feels like here , " Denny thought , rubbing the shoulder ; " this is a tickle . This is a pat . " He even lightly twisted a finger until the eyes reflected irritation and discomfort . He followed the sinews of each leg and then reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Smooth me , Daddy , " said Charlie , and then Denny realized what the boy was asking him to do , or was it that Denny realized that there was one gift left to bestow ? What does it feel like there ? What will I miss ? Denny could do this for a son , not for a daughter . As the boy , in dreamy rest now , lay still on his sheet , Denny parted the tapes of the diaper and put his hand on his stomach . He traced down to the penis , to the tiny purplish tip , to the vacant scrotum . Denny looked up to Charlie , and the eyes were full of surprise and joy . Denny knew there would be no shame between them , even as the penis became erect , a slight nub of a thing . Denny imagined what he himself liked , how he liked to be touched , and he tried to do it , running his thumb up and down the bottom and closing the tip into his palm . He kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second what a doctor or nurse would think , and Charlie finally seemed to fall asleep , a rest full of gratitude , a relief from struggle , a life , as far as it went , full of joy . <p> In high school , Susan DeLorey 's large frame , her big hands and feet , had made her seem heavy . No one would have , or ever did , call her cute . " Solid , " they said , referring both to her body and her character . Perhaps marrying Denny , who spent most of his time in those days in bitter combat with his father , was one of the less practical things she had done . But Denny had settled down enough , taken an uneasy but consistent place as a partner in the family dairy , and he had begun to seem acceptable to the town ladies in comparison to the valedictorians and boy scouts who had long ago up and left their families with no warning . And since high school the cute girls , the short and skinny blonds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their blue jeans and peroxide , while Susan 's age caught up to her strong-boned features , straight posture , and thick brown hair . <p> Susan worked as the electric meter reader for all " non-metropolitan " areas of the county . It took her half-time , on her own time , and if someone invited her in for a cup of coffee and a doughnut , it was her decision to make . They gave her a car , with a whip antenna for its citizen 's band radio , which flexed coyly as she drove from farm to farm . She had inherited this deal from her father , and it came with her to the marriage like a dowry . When Denny was courting her , after they had both spent their twenties dating others , she sometimes worried that it was the job he had fallen in love with . <p> After Charlie was born she contemplated giving the job up , and Denny had persuaded her not to . He said that she needed more than ever to get out of the house and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always planned . When Charlie died she was behind by two or three months on her accounts , and two weeks after the funeral she began to work overtime . For the most part the customers , at least the ones that tended to be home during the day , were friends and admirers of hers . She came back from those first few days of meter reading in a car loaded with hams , and sticky buns , and roasted chickens , and pickled green tomatoes . <p> One evening , exhausted from a two-hundred-mile day , she was leaning across to gather some of these consoling gestures when she realized that her mind had slipped back in time for a moment , and that she thought she was reaching for Charlie in his car seat . She blinked past the illusion and saw that it was a casserole in her arms , and the hideous image of this food , and the shock of reliving the entire loss in a split second , gripped her in panic and she began to scream . <p> Denny heard her and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicks and punches ; he staggered off dazed from a good blow to his right eye , and she came after him , trying to hurt him . The hired hand saw her standing over Denny , kicking at him , and sprinted over the width of the farmyard . They called for Doctor Taylor , and he knocked her out with a full syringe of Nembutal . <p> Denny was off-duty for the morning milking , and he was sitting at her bedside when she woke up . Their bed was a four-poster that had been her grandmother 's , and Susan had made muslin curtains with ruffles to match the canopy . She had loved to sew before Charlie was born , lacy things , feminine touches of lace here and there throughout the house as if to mark off a boundary for the odors and substances of farm life . Denny had n't complained , but to this day , especially this day , he felt as if he slept in her private space . " How do you feel ? " he asked . <p> " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , rubbing his eye . <p> " I 'm sorry , Denny . " She cried rarely , and almost always for others , but this time , her face gripped by her large hands , her elbows clamped against her breasts , Denny could tell that she wept for herself . <p> " It 's all over now . We can look ahead . " He meant for these words to soothe , and he repeated them a few times . He did n't feel he needed to argue the point and therefore did not put a lot of emphasis behind them . <p> She snapped up from her clenched recline and opened her full face to him . " It 's that simple for you ? You think now that Charlie 's gone I 'll just let you back ? " <p> Denny knew what she meant , and he knew it was n't fair , not entirely . She had all too easily let him free of the pain . She had gathered everything that hurt into herself , every one of Charlie 's laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have said ; I 'm going to save that one for later . She had gone to each doctor 's appointment loaded with questions , and night after night she studied the packets of information from parents ' organizations and disease foundations . Denny could only scan these materials , squinting to screen the truths into a blur , looking for mention of a miracle cure . It seemed to Denny that everything in her mind had been backwards . Right up to the day Charlie died , she had continued to help him learn his numbers and letters . Though she must have known that the alphabet would remain half-unlearned forever , she seemed capable of staring into the deep almost cheerfully . Denny used to hear her teaching Charlie lessons for use later in life , and he had to cover his ears with his hands . Denny knew what Susan was saying , but it was n't as simple as she made it sound . <p> " Are you God now , Susan ? " <p> " No . There 's no word for what I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Denny almost argued that he was a father who had lost his , but he did n't think the loss was comparable , at least not in their house . He had often wondered what kind of father he would have been if Charlie had been healthy , and whether he would have behaved all that differently . Who knew ? But this he could say to the mother who had lost her child : that he was a man who lost the person who would have become his best friend . <p> " I 'm trying , " he said finally , " to make you feel better . I want you to feel better . " He spoke gingerly , not assuming too much , as if he was sharing her feelings out of kindness . <p> She heard these tones , and came bounding back . " Why did n't you love him ? That was all he asked , to be loved by his mother and father . " <p> Denny thought back to the last months of Charlie 's life , and the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What could she be thinking of ? He had no answer . He looked back at her blankly , and then said , " I 'm trying to keep you from losing everything else . " <p> She softened at this , even put out her hand to his . " Maybe you are . But there is n't anything you can do now . " She got up , still in the T-shirt and underpants that Denny had left on her the night before . He looked at the curve of her hips and he wanted suddenly to make love , to fall back into bed again like newlyweds . He could honestly picture this as something that might make things better , because it had been some years since they had really made love . For many months after Charlie was born they had not even tried , and then occasionally they had joined , and they did not have to remind each other that there was fate in their mingled fluids , they did not need to admit to each other that when Denny was done and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned on the sheet between them . They did not need to confess that anytime their flesh touched  --  a simple caress , a brush of the hands  --  their thoughts bored deep through the skin and into the code of damaged chromosomes . <p> Denny believed , as he watched his long-legged wife walk across the bedroom , that they could leave this behind now . He was ready , at this moment , with the sharp tremble of desire . But she closed the door of the bathroom behind her , and then turned on the shower , and when she came back out to the kitchen , she was dressed in her jeans and was holding her account book , #2 1/2 pencils , a flashlight , can of Halt , and her thermos . " I might be late this afternoon , " she said . " I 've got to go all the way to Grangerfield . " <p> Charlie died in May , and the long , buttery Chesapeake summer moved through plantings , through the flowering of the soybean plants toward the tasseling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this nurturing , but he stopped the tractor now and again on the rivershore and thought back to that unlucky morning , back to a moment , now jumbled in his memory , when he had hoped that just beginning a life was enough to give it meaning . He made his turns on the tractor , and many times as he approached the riverbank he imagined what would happen if he simply kept going , down over the crumbling yellow clay and onto the pebbled beach , and then into the warm brackish ripples and out onto the sandbars , a mile or two into the Chester River before the water reached higher than his axles . <p> Susan was often away from the farm these days , even into the early evening , still catching up on her accounts , maybe , or hanging around with old high-school friends to whom she 'd never before paid the least attention . They all had babies , even big kids now , and after the difficulty of getting pregnant in the first place , and then Charlie , Denny could hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy chaos . But he had nothing better to offer , the gray silence of the house , the farm . As Susan said earlier in the summer , the real crop on this family farm was death . She said they were n't living there anymore as much as waiting to see who went next : the logical one  --  Denny 's father ; the unnecessary one  --  Susan ; or the unexpected one  --  Denny himself . None of them had gained anything other than front-pew seats at the funerals . She said that Denny could not offer life to her , or she to him , the promise of it , and he knew well enough what she meant . <p> Evening after evening , after milking , Denny walked the length of the farmyard in the knowledge that the three men on the place , himself , his father , and the latest teenaged hand , were all heading home to empty houses . <p> " It appears that your wife ai n't spending too much time at home these days , " said Denny 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing in the roadway between their two houses , and the heat in the parlor had drained them both . He was n't being hostile calling her " your wife " ; he was of an older school . <p> " Her private affairs are her business , " Denny argued . <p> The old man agreed . " I 'm not anyone to pry . " <p> " But what ? " said Denny . <p> " Things have to be managed , do n't they ? " his father asked back . This was an old point , his refrain from the years when Denny fought against him and against the endless repetitive details of the farm life . <p> " You do n't manage a marriage like fences and Johnson grass , Dad . There 's nothing I can do . " <p> The old man gave him the same disappointed look that he had worn during those arguments in his teenaged years , and Denny simply stared back , as he had done years ago . " There is always something , " said his father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took those words home with him , across the broad lawn , and waited up for Susan to come back . It was seven thirty when she pulled in . She was wearing her pale green shirt , with a new satiny scarf tied over the tops of her shoulders . She was carrying a sack of groceries , and she started to put them away , a bag of flour , a few cans of corned beef hash , frozen vegetables , without greeting him . He wondered if she thought of him anymore as she walked up and down the aisles of the Acme , what he liked ; he could not imagine her putting much attention on shared meals , just on food , just on the common need to eat something . <p> " Sue , " he said . <p> " Huh ? " <p> " I 'm not stupid . I 'm trying to help . " She seemed not to pick up on his invitation to confess . He added , " You can trust me . " <p> She glanced over ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned on a lamp . " I never said you were stupid . " " So where are we at ? " <p> " I think we 're just floating , as long as you ask what I think . I think I 'm just waiting . I do n't think anything that has happened all summer is real . " <p> " I 'm dairying , " he stated . " That 's real . " <p> " Denny , as long as you ask  --  " <p> " I am , " he interrupted , " I am asking . " <p> " Well I 'm seeing someone . I 'm seeing someone who makes me feel better . " <p> The truth hit his gut ; he could not deny that . But he could also not deny that he and Mandy Towle , in the occasional circling and looping through lives in small towns , had fallen together a few times over the years . " Why ? " he asked . She shrugged . <p> " Do n't think I do n't know why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes darted , but she only shook her head and told him that he could not possibly know what she was thinking . <p> " You 're going to leave me behind , is that it ? " <p> " Stop . " <p> " Throw me off like a Kleenex ? " <p> She did not respond to this right away , but continued to lean against the kitchen counter as she considered things , and she began slowly to get more and more angry , and Denny could not divine if it was because he had located her private truth , but at last she wheeled around for something to throw at him , and came up with a canister of flour , which would have been almost funny , an explosion of white mist . Denny waited , readying himself to avoid the sharp edges of the tin , but after a few moments she put it down . " You asshole , " she said , and went into her bedroom . <p> Denny slept , as he had been doing for a month or two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her room and said , " I 'm sorry . You can do what you like . That 's all I wanted to say . " But she was already gone . <p> Denny had a gift for machines . Before he was out of his teens , other farmers , even mechanics in town , began to seek him out to perform magic with a welder and metal lathe . He could do this , engineering answers not on paper but with his hands . The shop , from which these bits of genius came , was at the end of the barn complex closest to his house . It had been the granary , and the walls were still lined with rodent-proof tin . There was a single low window that looked down toward the creek , and in the afternoon , when the light came sideways , orange off the water , the grease-shined floor and tin walls glowed , a radiance that started at the feet and worked upward as the sun fell . Early in Denny 's marriage , his friends used to gather in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's project , and the women gathered with Susan , cooking and drinking wine and Irish Mist , and after everyone staggered home and after he and Susan had made love a little on the dirty side , Denny lay back in the four-poster and thought the future was offering itself to him not in years , which no one could predict , but in seasons , certain and always new . <p> The winter Susan was living in town  --  she had moved in with her friend Beth on Raymond Street , but spent most of her time in Chestertown  --  Denny closed himself into his shop . The maw of the vise stayed open , and the roller chest of Snap-On tools remained untouched . Often , at the end of milking , he went straight there , sat down in his cold Morris chair and stared out the low window across the lawn and to the creek , to the black winter water lapping at a brittle rim of tidal ice . Occasionally , when the weather was n't too cold , Denny slept the night in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stole over to the house for breakfast , eating quietly as if she were asleep behind the thin partition of the kitchen . Early in the fall he went into town a few times to see Mandy Towle . They 'd always liked each other , and she deserved a lot better than two failed marriages , one of them to a man from Kent County who was now in jail for house-renovation schemes that preyed on the elderly . She deserved a lot better than Denny , in these circumstances , which they both understood . She sent him home the last time , back to his shop , with a sisterly hug . <p> His father often stopped in to check on him , and occasionally sat down to talk . They stayed on dairying , for the most part , which was n't a subject that held a lot more cheer than the remains of Denny 's family life . " Just sell the goddamn place , " Denny said once ; " sell out and move to Florida . You deserve it . " When his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still hoped for the best . <p> " Do you think she 's going to come back ? " Denny asked . He knew that Susan had called his father once or twice . <p> " I expect what she 's going through has a shape of its own . " <p> Denny and Susan talked when they ran into each other in the street , and people could look out the windows of Todman 's Insurance , or Latshaw 's Jewelers , or Price and Gammon Hardware , and see them meeting like old sweethearts . The town was full of these almost-forgotten couplings , kids who had maybe once or twice fucked each other in his father 's haywagon , or all winter long in her father 's Buick , and what remained was a county full of people who treated each other like siblings , with the accidental intimacy of brothers and sisters who had shared the same bathroom . That 's how it felt to Denny , meeting Susan on the street , and she seemed to want it that way , as if by wiping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , had run out on them , had perhaps been running out on them for years : quality time , as the doctor said , had given way to the dry consolations of memory . " Until death do us part " would perhaps , despite love , turn out to be not long enough . <p> Denny brought these thoughts back into his workshop , these repetitious looping stabs at reason , all these variations on history . He tried to make sense of it , but he was finally bored by this hibernation and , as if in prayer , his thoughts began to wander . He could not say exactly from where or why the idea had come to him , but as the first stirrings of warmer weather came on the March winds , he realized that he had begun to concentrate more and more on the water , of the highways it offered , down the Bay perhaps , and out to sea . His father hated the water ; most farmers did . All it did was steal away land , a furrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kids went out on the water to drink beer . Watermen went out there to do God knew what . The Bay , that long question mark out there beyond Kent Island : Denny 's father had raised him to believe the Bay was not only wet and dangerous but immoral , a slippery surface choppy with wasted money . <p> But the water called to Denny . It seemed to offer refreshment for his soul ; it was as if he had recognized that he had been looking at only the land side of his life all these years , and had been missing what was perhaps the fuller half . He spent hours imagining boats , revarnishing and repainting the woodwork , overhauling the engine in the cooked odors of a clean bilge . He could not imagine why , up to now , he had never been curious about them . They seemed self-contained and sufficient , at once economical in space but extravagant with amenity . <p> In late spring Denny got in touch with the watermen at the Centreville landing , for whom he had repaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them he wanted a workboat . The watermen were willing to help him , an intruder on the water , as long as he did n't tell anyone ; when they found a good boat in Crisfield , they brought it up for him at night . <p> The following day , after knock-off , he drove it in the creek and dropped anchor at the farm . His father , as Denny had expected , was standing on the creekbank ten minutes later . <p> " What in hell is this ? " the old man yelled . <p> Denny paddled over in a dinghy that had been thrown into the deal and stood beside his father to admire the boat . It looked like a destroyer , a dropping curve that started high and fixed at the bowsprit and then seemed to go on forever , like a view . " It 's a boat , " said Denny finally . <p> The old man was speechless ; all the slack he 'd given to Denny this winter , and this was what came of it , a boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what in hell you mean to do with it . " <p> " I do n't know , Dad , " said Denny . It was the truth . One thing Denny had learned during his winter months was to tell the truth . " Maybe I 'll do some crabbing . Maybe you and me will go out and have picnics , " he shouted as his father retreated back up the lawn to his house . " Maybe you and me will take it through the Narrows and down the Bay . Maybe we 'll just keep going south . " <p> For the next six or seven Sundays , through May and into the first heat of June , Denny threw himself into his project . He had never had much regard for watermen as mechanics : they tended to make repairs underway with vise-grips and then forget about them when they returned to port . Denny was delighted to have so much to do . His father continued to grumble for a week or two , but relented in the end to the point of putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mulberry tree and passing his Sundays on the bank . Occasionally they chatted with each other across the few feet of waters <p> One day in June , Denny had his head deep into dark thwarts of the hull when he heard the scrape of the lawn chair over the shells and pebbles of the bank . He assumed it was his father and did not come up for twenty minutes , and when he did finally it was Susan he saw . She was wearing a yellow shirt , which made her dark hair shine . Denny could not believe how lovely she looked , a wife on the shore awaiting a sailor returning from a long cruise . He poled his flat-bottomed dinghy to her . <p> " I see you 've got yourself a project . " She was humoring him , as if the boat was childish , like electric trains . <p> " It feels good to be fixing something , for a change . " He came down hard on the last word . <p> She looked over at him , and betrayed no emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denny could smell the slight shade of her perfume . <p> " So who you dressing up for today ? " he said . <p> She gave him no answer , no anger , no hurt . " Denny , a lot has happened to us , has n't it ? " <p> He shrugged , but it was clear to him that she had said this in preparation for something . Asking for a divorce , most likely . Get the unpleasantness over with , then drive back out to Route 50 and meet up with her accountant from Chestertown , or whatever he was , the person she dressed up for . <p> She continued . " None of it made such sense , did it ? I mean , why did Charlie have to die ? " <p> " Charlie 's dying is the only thing that made any sense at all , " Denny snapped back . " He had cystic fibrosis . Remember ? What happened to him started happening from the moment he was conceived . It 's a disease that began millions of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water ass-backwards . Who the hell knows where it come from ? " Denny realized he was shouting . " Charlie made sense , Sue . It 's what happened to us in the meantime that does n't make sense . " <p> She raised her hands , almost as helplessly as if shielding herself from a pistol shot . " Okay . Okay , " she yelled . " What happened to us . You want to whip my ass , Denny . Do it . " <p> They looked at each other for a few minutes across the oily shine of the boat 's pistons , laid out on a rag . <p> " What I mean is , " she began again , " that we 've lived through some times I never expected , and we 've done things I never imagined doing . " <p> He shrugged , but she was right enough about that , right enough to say that everything she had done or thought since Charlie was born was contrary to logic , especially treating Denny as if he was to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I have n't seen anyone since Christmas , " she added . <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because it does n't make me feel better . ! still want to die , " she said . Her radiance , from a distance , had been an illusion . She looked very bad , haggard and worn-out from within . Denny wondered if she had been looking this miserable all winter and whether he was just now noticing because he had turned the corner . But he did not want to feel sorry for her yet . He got up , grabbed a handful of oyster shells , and flung them in a spray far across the water . A heron , feeding in the green shade of the other side of the creek , took this as a sign that it ought to move on , and it leaned forward , chest almost on the water , and then kicked its long legs into the flapping of its wings . It skimmed slow , unlikely , doomed , until it busted out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesus , " said Denny finally . " You 've slapped me from one side of this county to the other ; I 'm so bruised by you that my piss is purple . There 's some mercy in this somewhere , is n't there ? " <p> She looked at him and nodded , and it was a look he had not seen in a long time . She could not have been offering herself as mercy , but as faith . Her eyes suggested , her head tipped toward the house , but still he could ignore these gestures and they could vanish as if they had been nothing . Denny did not know how to tell her yes ; instead , he nodded back at her , and if she expected the beginning of caress on the way across the lawn , she did not show it . As they entered the bedroom , Denny was telling himself , as he had not done in many years , that he would soon make love to this woman in front of him . <p> She undressed with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgotten the strength of her body , how broad and powerful she looked across her upper chest , how quick and nimble she looked at the tuck of her waist , how sufficient and frank she looked from the stretched points of her hipbones and to the inside of her thighs . Denny had also undressed , and she gave him a little smile as they stood and looked at each other across the room . Her eyes dropped to his penis , and his to the patch of her pubic hair , and he pictured the outstretched arms of her tubes , the encyclopedia drawings with each ovary clutched at the curled extreme , and he pictured a line of eggs like pearls , some perfect , some flawed , ready to drop one by one into potential life , and then beyond . He pictured the grip of her uterus . She was looking at his penis , and he knew she also was tracing backwards to unanswered questions of that genetic disease , following on the long circuitous route to his balls , where there were sperm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> They stood facing each other , naked as if new , and they understood that they needed far more than pleasure to make him erect and to open her to him . And with that understanding , pleasure did come to him , and she smiled again , this time more slyly , as he stiffened . <p> " Hello , Denny , " she said , a joke from long ago . <p> He said nothing  --  this was as always  --  as they finally joined on the bed . He traced her lines , and searched for wetness and warmth , and very soon she was sliding one leg under him , and he did not ask what she knew about this minute in her month , and did not ask whether she had , in anticipation of this moment , driven over with her diaphragm in place , and did not ask whether she might want him to hunt through the bed-stand for a condom . He allowed himself to be guided in . They rested for a moment , centered and tied in this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was ready for an orgasm he was ejaculating inside her , and he pictured it not as a burst but as a showering , a mist like soft rain . Susan felt him come , and she too imagined what was happening inside her body , and it was a tumbling she thought of first , like the tumbling of an egg on its passage outward , and then  --  though she had not expected it  --  pleasure came to her also , and she pictured a wall , a brick wall slowly giving way to his continued motion and to the rhythmic encouragement of her own flesh . <p> Two months later , on a Sunday , Susan sat on the porch and looked across the barnyard to the water . She could see out the creek , across the wide mouth of the river to Eastern Neck , and then , on clear days such as this one , across the dark line of the Bay and toward the smudged air of Baltimore . She knew Denny would be out there somewhere on his boat , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had a cup of coffee resting precariously on her thigh , and was reading the Sun in the streams of September light ; she was warmed by the sensations and was happy to read the movie reviews , though she went to the show only rarely , with her friends Beth and Delia from town , and when she did the other two spent the whole time making silly cracks about how beautiful the male actors were and how skinny the women . <p> When Susan thought about love and men these days , and about the past year , and about her son , her thoughts came ordered like a liturgy . It was necessary , in terms of fairness , for her to start always with her own general confession , with a listing of the things she had done . She did not think having an affair with Jack Marston was a particularly kind or clever thing to do . But Susan , as she considered these things , also had to go forward and admit that she had at least taken up once again a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had confessed , she could proceed to a thanksgiving , to say that she was grateful that Denny had given her what he could , freedom if not understanding ; and then , because Susan did not blink at herself or at Denny or at the eternal pain losing a child had caused her , she gave thanks that Jack Marston had been there , because , in retrospect , without him she might have done something even less clever , killed herself maybe . And finally , in her supplications , she could pray for the people in her life , for Denny 's health and happiness , her mother and his father , for her sisters and their children . But not for herself , yet . She did not know what she wanted next ; she did not know whether this move back , which she had done a few weeks after they made love , would work . She was waiting patiently for a sign . All she knew was that she feared nothing : she would never again be afraid , just a little hesitant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She glanced down the length of the barns , silver in the morning light , and watched her father-in-law wash his car . He did this every Sunday morning in his milking clothes , before changing and then sleeping in front of the television . He had , last winter , called her a " loose woman . " She had not argued with him ; if she had she would have told him that ever since Charlie had been born it seemed everyone on the place simply wanted her gone , and that she had done precisely that . She might have tried to explain to him that she had taken with her all those bits of Charlie 's life that needed a resting place somewhere far from the farm . But during her marriage she 'd never argued with Denny 's father , and he had a dim talent for her ways of thinking . Susan had always thought of her father-in-law as a child , and girl-child at that , with a front tooth missing from her occasional frightened smile , a sort of waif trapped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Susan came back out onto the porch from filling her coffee cup , she saw that the old man had finished with his car , had walked down the long lawn to the water and was staring out into the river . With his jug ears , his hearing had always been remarkable ; he could sit in the barnyard and tell , from nothing audible to her , that the baler had broken down on the point field or that the hired hand was now in fourth gear on the Kubota and was heading for home . Perhaps he had heard Denny 's boat coming in . It was a restful sight , the man under the waterside mulberry tree . <p> He turned slightly as she approached and then looked back out to the river . <p> " Is he coming in ? " she asked . <p> " Sounded like it . " <p> She took up her place beside him . The water was dappled gold ; the slight onshore breeze was clean , clean but rich , like the air that came with the fresh-shucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell the fresh milk warming on her father-in-law 's clothes . " Do you see him ? " <p> He waved his hand outward . There were several boats in view , in distinguishable to her except , perhaps , for the sailboats way over by the Narrows . <p> " What 's he up to , with this boat ? " the old man asked . He began by spitting out the words , but ended with a genuine question . <p> She stopped halfway around . " He likes being out on the water . He thinks it will save him . " <p> The old man protested , this time with the beginning of a sarcastic snarl . " Save him from what ? Seems to me what will save us  --  " <p> She put her hand out onto his shoulder and he stopped abruptly . They both looked at her hand , big , strong , a mother 's hand , resting on his thinning frame , the white of her flesh against the green of his chino jacket . They both recognized that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handshakes and the usual bumps in the narrow parlor when she filled in at milking , they had never touched in any way . A slight breeze , flavored with cattle , rose up behind them . It seemed almost miraculous for them to be joined on this small point of land . <p> " Denny always took things hard , " he said , after she had withdrawn . <p> " That 's all I 'm trying to say . " <p> Susan thought about Denny for a second , the man high in the tractor or deep , confident with his tools , in the guts of the combine . <p> " I do n't suspect you know that he was a soft boy . He liked to be held by his Mama . " <p> Susan had guessed this , but it made tears come to her eyes anyway . <p> " By the time you knew him , he was fresh enough , " said the old man . He pulled out a handkerchief  --  a wash rag they used to clean the teats before plugging them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knew what it was , still damp with disinfectant , and she took it . " He was even softer than his sisters . One year he planted a flower garden over behind the equipment bays and he made bouquets and vases of flowers , you know , to give . It was a girlish thing to do , " the man said , sounding as confused now , and as unsure , as he must have thirty years ago , a dairy farmer with a boy who loved flowers . " The teachers were partial to him . " <p> Susan listened , and waited for more , wanted these images to do their job , feeling as if these tears could be the ones she had been waiting for all this time . <p> " If I had it to do over again ... " he began , and then stopped . Neither of them needed him to describe how he had reacted to this child . <p> " What ? " she asked . She brought her hand to her face and felt the oily release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at him and I catch a glimpse of that soft boy . In his eyes , I expect . It 's like he is asking me for something . I always figured he would get it from his own family , but that was n't to be . I always hoped you could make it right . " <p> " I  --  " she said , ready to tell him she could n't do it alone , but he talked past her . <p> " I wish you could see the boy like ! do , " he interrupted . <p> He had ended on a sort of question , a plea perhaps , and now seemed to want her to respond . But she no longer had anything to say , no answers to a father so troubled by his son , no apologies to a father who loved his boy . They waited as she blew her nose , and they both turned their stares out to the water , as if worried Denny might sneak up in his boat and overhear this conversation . <p> She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not helped her . To ward off the impulse , she thought back for a moment to herself as a schoolgirl , without blemish , living in the uncomplicated glow . She had always liked herself best in her Brownie uniform ; because the older girls wore precisely the same costume , Susan did n't feel so awkwardly big and tall . Perhaps at some point in the past year or two , she had let the girl in the brown dress out of her grasp , let her fall away as if disappearing down a sweet but deep well . She no longer felt , as she had in her younger adulthood , that she was living as two people , the girl and the woman . <p> " I sometimes think all of us out here just gave up a little early , " she said . <p> " Speak for yourself , " he said , but it was n't said harshly . It was more of an absolution than a retort . <p> " Oh , " she said . " I 've got plenty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The old man put up his hand to stop her . He turned to go , but seemed reluctant to leave this brilliant September day and to let this conversation stop . He looked at her , and made her realize that he believed the next step was hers . <p> " Charles , " she said . She rarely used his name . <p> " What ? " <p> " I ca n't fix everything . You know that . It 's not as if I have any magic . " She did not know why she was so certain that this was what he wanted . <p> " I 'm not asking for magic . You 've come home . That 's enough to keep from offending the dead , " he said finally . " The boy and my wife . " He began to walk away , heading up towards his house . Susan found herself waving to him as he departed , and then turned quickly to see that Denny had entered the mouth of the creek , a tall-weather bow , unnaturally , stunningly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She waited on the creekbank , sitting in the dry autumn grasses . Denny caught the mooring ball and was making the line fast . He seemed in a good mood , his skin a golden reflection in the tea-colored water . He looked fine as a waterman , big-chested over the low sides of the boat . Suddenly , as she looked upon this graceful scene , from deep in her lungs came a wave of joy , a relief as if for the first time in years her whole body had relaxed . She could feel it in her chest and in her shoulders . Could it be , Susan wondered , that this morning , this very moment , was what she had been waiting for , that mourning would end with the same abruptness with which it had begun , begun with the words , out of a sleep as any parent fears it most , a strange doctor saying , " Wake up , wake up , it 's about your son Charlie . " But Charlie is n't even born yet , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be waking me up with bad news about Charlie ? <p> " Hey , " Denny called out as he poled close . <p> " Shhh , " she said , putting a finger to her lips . She did not know why it was necessary for him not to talk . She watched him struggle for a second or two with an answer , perhaps even an angry complaint about being cut short when all he was saying was hello . Since she had moved back they had been careful with each other , and had not probed for feelings , and had sat silent for phrases or thoughts they did not understand . Asking for explanations would have done no good . Susan wished that her life and her marriage were that simple ; she could hardly remember the time when it was , when words took care of what words were supposed to and touch handled the rest . <p> " Can you be with me here for a minute ? " she asked . <p> He sat down beside her on the bank . He had moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her seat to face him she saw the old man watching them from the patch of grass in front of his house . The three of them hoping for a peace or for a change , depending on her . It was maybe not much of an audience . Out of all the people she had known in her life , her own family , her girl friends , the boys and men , her electric company customers , out of the planet 's billions only these few , this assortment , looked to her . Was that enough to make any of this worth it ? <p> " A real pretty day out there , " said Denny , Denny the soft boy , the one who loved flowers . <p> She moved closer to him , her knees parting the grass as if she were still in school , still looking up at Denny from her spot at the senior picnic . She took his hand , spread it out between hers , attempting to flatten the natural cup of his palm with her thumbs . She could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It may be over , " she said . She held her breath , waiting to see how this would feel , once said . A vee of geese honked overhead , a cow bellowed angrily from the holding yard , a school of small fish breached the surface in front of them in a gravelly shower . She was glad to have these other voices join in with hers . <p> " I 'm hoping so too , " he answered . <p> She wished , for a moment , that he had not used this word . Of course she had hoped for many things , beginning with herself , things done and things left undone . She had hoped to be a mother , but for the moment , once risked , it was better to put that hope aside . Especially with the new knowledge and choices that could be revealed in a drop of her fluid , conceiving life seemed to have much too much to do with death . She had hoped not to be still thinking in such terms , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a better word  --  that Denny could suddenly become someone quite different , starting with what she had learned was a slight defect , a trivial speck of dust , located on the long arm of his chromosome 7 . Denny could also be more communicative , less defensive , more open to suggestion , less interested in sex , more interested in love ; he could not have that palm-sized birthmark on his left flank and his breath could be nicer when he awoke . Hope , in other words , seemed a little beside the point for Susan . <p> He said , " It did n't seem anyone did anything wrong , anyway . That 's the thing . Neither of us did anything wrong . " <p> She quieted him once more , and this time he seemed content to sit with her in the grass . She could see Denny 's father disappearing into his house ; she could see the inevitable lineup of cows beginning at the far gate , drawn by the pressure of time as they measured it . She felt Denny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down to see him moving to pick up one of hers . She would know everything when he did . There was no way for either of them to lie on this one : the moment had come , almost five years reduced to a slight clasp of his hand . It could be a little too tight and then relax too abruptly ; a sort of halfhearted greeting , something for a cousin , something to be gotten over . That would mean that they would live out their lives side by side , but that it would never be sweet again . His grasp could be too loose , a kind of forgetful drape , the kind of thing you do to keep your balance . If so , they would drift apart in a year or two , and perhaps he would lose the farm and start drinking . Or he could run his hand into hers , flatten it against her palm and find the fit for his fingers ; he could search and then , slowly , take what she gave him , herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is what she expects , and it will be enough , not perhaps for every man and every woman , but for her , and for him , for now . <p> <p> By Christopher Tilghman <p>
