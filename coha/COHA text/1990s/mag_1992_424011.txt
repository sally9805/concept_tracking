<p> Never have there been as many people interested in learning to make art and as many other people willing and able to teach them . The ways in which this teaching can take place have also grown , encompassing schools ( both formal and informal , such as in an artist 's studio ) , recreational art classes ( in a variety of settings ) , correspondence school courses in art , watching paint-along programs on television , reading art instruction texts , and viewing art instruction videocassettes . <p> One never can be sure what to expect from any of these means of instruction until they have been tried-a particular teacher may not be rigorous enough-but there are usually ways to cut one 's losses if a specific program does n't work out . Schools frequently allow students to drop courses with minimal penalties , and the sponsors of art classes usually require payment only for the classes one has attended . <p> With art instruction books and videocassettes , however , the situation is a bit more complicated . One can not " sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible with an art class or school , and most art instruction books are not available in libraries for browsing . Some books , of course , are sold in bookstores and art supply shops , and one may thumb through them as long as the manager or sales help tolerates it . <p> More commonly , those who are interested in learning or developing skills in art find out about art instruction books and videocassettes through advertisements in the backs of art magazines , where the cost of advertising limits the amount of information about the programs . What 's more , many art instruction books and videos have similar titles-Make Your Watercolors Sing and Making Color Sing ( published by North Light Books and Watson-Guptill , respectively )  --  that make ferreting out obvious differences somewhat difficult . <p> How do you find out about , and choose among , them ? There are many questions prospective buyers should ask . Does the book feature a variety of illustrations ( by a number of different artists or by one artist ) or just a few pictures and a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for repeated playings ? Is the writing clear and the author 's philosophy a help rather than a hindrance ? Are the chapters set up as self-contained lessons or is the book divided according to various themes ? Does the video offer step-by-step instruction on selecting a subject , choosing colors and mixing them , using brushes and other materials , building up layers , and creating an image , or does it more specifically highlight a particular artist at work ? Is the book or video geared to the correct level of the student ? <p> There is a book or video for every aspiring artist , but you must determine what you want or need , then formulate questions for the publishers of these materials . Most publishers , video production companies , or artists selling books and videocassettes will provide a brochure or some written information about their products , which may include critical reviews in art magazines , testimonials from satisfied customers , a biography about the author or artist , and a sample illustration , as well as some idea of what is featured in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will answer questions over the telephone ( some have toll-free numbers , while others return calls left on their answering machines ) . <p> Prospective buyers would want to know the artistic medium used and whether the book or video is intended for beginners or artists with intermediate or advanced skills . Authors and artists generally have a specific reader in mind when they create an instructional book or video , and that is usually made clear in the title , introduction , or elsewhere early on . When the specific reader or viewer is not indicated , the book or video is probably intended for the more experienced artist . <p> Instructional material for the beginner may focus on inspirational themes , such as developing one 's creative instincts and how to see the world , and move on to various activities in drawing or painting . Other books and videos for the novice aim to provide a basic grounding in how to draw or paint ; how to select one 's subject , medium , and tools ; and how to critique one 's own work . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists may examine such technical problems as how to capture an object 's texture in a painting , pose models , or set up lighting . Some instructional programs for experienced artists look at how the Old Masters worked or examine techniques of non-Western artists , such as Chinese brush painters . Other books and videos for the more advanced artist may explore how to refine one 's working methods or how certain well-known artists , such as David Hockney and Philip Pearlstein , approach their subjects and create their paintings . <p> Prospective buyers , especially those who are experiencing their first serious exposure to artmaking , would certainly want to know whether or not there is a description of the tools used ( airbrush , brushes , palette knives , pencils , for instance ) and discussion of such concerns as-and definitions of-shape , space edge , contrast , color temperature , color mixing , color intensity , perspective , composition , content , foreground and background , texture , line , grid , surface , and how they all relate to each other . <p> Book buyers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in knowing if different styles are represented ( abstract , impressionist , realist , for example ) as well as a variety of subjects ( water , landscape , the figure , etc. ) and ways of working ( from a photograph , a model , in the studio , outdoors ) . Some videos also come with workbooks and other written materials in order to summarize what is on the tape , while some drawing books include pencil kits in order to help the artist get started . <p> No promotional brochures or selected reviews can answer all one 's questions . Are any color reproductions in the book of a suitably high quality , and does the artist in the video appear comfortable in front of a camera ? Books should provide a detailed discussion of the topics or artistic problems at hand while , in a video , the commentary should be subordinate to the image . <p> There may be other problems that a student of art has with the manner of teaching in the book or video that have nothing to do with technical deficiencies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher is quite personal , and it is no different when the teacher is a book or videocassette . Therefore , a final question to ask the publisher , video production company , distributor , or artist is about the returns policy . <p> No federal ( or state ) law enables you to return a product just because you are not " completely satisfied . " The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) or state attorney general may bring action on false claims ( " Guaranteed to Teach Anyone to Paint a Million-Dollar , Museum-Quality Masterpiece in One Week " ) or misrepresentations in advertisements . However , claims such as " Learn How to Paint " are not specific enough to warrant state or federal inquiry if a customer is not satisfied . <p> According to Bonnie Janson , an attorney for the FTC , " it would be extremely difficult to win a complaint if you did n't learn to paint , because it 's a subjective problem-you may be stupid . In this realm , any claim may be true or not true , because we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the correct tips to learning how to paint ? " <p> Return policies vary as each company makes its own rules , determining its own period of time for returns or refunds and for which reasons . The Lela Harty School of Art in San Diego , for instance , which markets a four-videocassette series of art instruction for $119.95 , states in its printed brochure that the videos come with a " 30 day money back guarantee .... Simply return the course and the purchase price will be refunded with no questions asked . " The American Artist Book Club also guarantees that " if you are not delighted with your ... book , return it within 15 days , cancel your membership and owe nothing . " North Light Books , another large publisher of art instruction tests , allows readers 10 days to decide <p> Lela Harty notes that " maybe five percent of the people who have purchased the videocassette have returned it . Some of them feel that they are beyond the course , which I do n't feel is quite true , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the people who have returned videos may have made copies of them , but I ca n't do much about that . " <p> Many marketers of videocassettes fear the potential of illegal copies and , in order to protect themselves , have established return policies that are exchange-only-they will exchange a defective video for one that is free of defects . Both Centerpoint Distribution in San Jose , California and Artists ' Video Productions in Bristol , Rhode Island deal with customer complaints in this manner . <p> Still , there is the chance of customers arguing themselves into a different settlement . Dee Alexander , director of Operations at Centerpoint Distribution , says that if someone who calls up is " really unhappy with a video he bought , we can make an exception and refund his money . That did happen twice . " <p> In general , however , it is wisest to assume that , when a company or individual makes no specific mention of a returns or refunds policy , none exists . Efforts to satisfy customers with complaints may range quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as possible about the books or videocassettes offered becomes so important . <p> Some companies may not have a written policy , or even any written material about the products they offer , but will provide detailed information about their books or cassettes as well as indicate a money-back guarantee over the telephone . As noted previously , some of them are quite happy to discuss their products with potential buyers by phone and answer specific questions . For protection 's sake , you should write down what is said about the particular product as well as about the returns or refunds policy and the name of the person with whom you spoke . If any misrepresentation is made , such as the description of a money-back refund if you are unhappy for any reason , then you may make a formal complaint to your state consumer protection office , the state attorney general , or the Federal Trade Commission . <p> Art instruction books , of course , are not the only sources for printed information and advice on how to create . Many magazines and journals for artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a variety of media . These same publications also frequently review instructional books and videos in the field . <p> <p> Where to Contact Distributors TABLE <p> ILLUSTRATION : Paint brush <p> By Daniel Grant <p> <p> Mr. Grant is a freelance art writer in Massachusetts . <p>
