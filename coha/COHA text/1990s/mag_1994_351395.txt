It was clear from the start how Ammar Shawa , 12 , died . His family was posing for photographs with newly arrived Palestinian soldiers in Jericho when one of them allowed Ammar 's 13-year-old brother to handle a loaded AK-47 rifle . It went off , accidentally , and the bullet shattered the younger boy 's head . Immediately , local activists of the Palestine Liberation Organization put out a story to townsfolk that withdrawing Israeli soldiers had deliberately left the rifle behind to cause an accident . Later they said that an Arab collaborating with Israel had given the boy the gun , and then that ammunition left by the Israelis had exploded and caused the fatal accident . Only a few hours later , the P.L.O . came clean : one of its men was to blame , the organization said , and he had been arrested and jailed . <P> The story illustrates two phenomena : how Palestinians automatically blame Israel for trouble of any kind , and how they are beginning to unlearn the reflex that has become so deeply ingrained . Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It is a huge transition that we must make in our mentality . " <P> The difficult metamorphosis began in earnest last week when the Israelis completed their withdrawal from two enclaves of Palestinian self-rule , one surrounding Jericho in the West Bank , the other covering most of the Gaza Strip . In both areas , civilian affairs were turned over to P.L.O . control , as was public order and safety . To replace the occupying forces , some 3,000 Palestinian troops , arriving from exile mostly in Egypt , Iraq and Jordan , were put to work as soldiers and policemen  --  a force that is to eventually grow to 9,000 . <P> In the Gaza Strip there was trouble from the start . As Israeli soldiers pulled out of their last outpost in the city of Gaza , they were pelted with stones by Palestinian demonstrators . Yet stones could prove to be the least of Israel 's problems . Under the self-rule agreement , about 5,000 Jewish settlers remain in the Gaza Strip . They are protected by Israeli soldiers and  --  at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially Muslim extremists who remain opposed to peace with Israel . After the turnover , Jewish settlers were fired at and wounded on four occasions in the Gaza Strip ; in a drive-by attack , militants killed two Israeli soldiers manning a roadblock just inside the zone . <P> Guarding the roads on which the settlers and other Israelis travel through the autonomous regions is the task of joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols . In the strip , the Israelis complained , such missions were scarcely functioning  --  because , they said , Palestinian security men were not showing up . A high- ranking Israeli military officer characterized the situation as " almost total anarchy . " <P> By contrast , calm prevailed in Jericho , a generally peaceful town where militants have never gained a foothold . There , 730 Palestinian peacekeepers found themselves directing traffic and helping tidy up the city . " They are highly professional and give people a sense of security , " said Emad Barahmeh , a Jericho shopkeeper . An Israeli lieutenant colonel concurred : " I have only compliments for their performance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
