<p> BEWARE OF THE CHINESE AND THE BOMB <p> Editor  --  At a time when Secretary of Defense Perry is disclosing our self-inflicted weaknesses to the Chinese military , you can perform a great service to the citizens of this country to inform them of what the Chinese have in store for us . <p> From the " Nuclear Weapons Databook , Vol. 5 " ( Westview Press , 1994 ) , reviewed in the September issue of Scientific American : " The Chinese have the largest nuclear stockpile , some 450 warheads and bombs . The largest single warheads are now also Chinese , mounted on four liquid-fueled missiles targeted on U.S. cities ; each yields close to five megatons . " <p> The last thing I want to do is to arouse the ban-the-bomb types . They are counterproductive to peace . Not they , but the Strategic Defense Initiative ( read : Silicon Valley , et al. ) brought down the threat of the Soviet Union . <p> President Clinton thinks that Gorbachev did it , but the Chinese know better ; it was SDI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Chinese missile attack will be Silicon Valley . Ironically , Secretary Perry 's own firm ESL is the bull's- eye . <p> Is anyone concerned ? The Clinton administration is dismantling defense , cancelled SDI , uses military as social workers and even as cocktail waiters in the White House . Even Secretary Perry is revealing our defense capabilities to the Chinese . <p> The baby-boom generation in the White House has now surpassed the naivete of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in 1939 . Everything he did was for peace , but what he gave us was World War II . Would n't it be the ultimate irony if policies of a draft dodger resulted in another war ? <p> BORUT PRAH <p> Oakland <p> . <p> LESSON FOR THE PROFESSOR <p> Editor  --  In Monday 's Open Forum , Thomas V. DiBacco brings up the tired , sad argument that President Clinton 's lack of military experience prevents him from being an able commander-in-chief . <p> His students would be well served if Professor DiBacco spent more time reading American history and less time sharing his ignorance about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II with a president  --  Franklin D. Roosevelt  --  who never directly served in the armed forces . Ditto for World War I  --  Woodrow Wilson . Abraham Lincoln 's military service was so scant that in later life he often made jest of it . But he led us through the Civil War as commander-in-chief . <p> DiBacco shares a problem a great many Americans seem to have today . No matter how great a success is brought by Bill Clinton 's actions and policies  --  forestalling a war with North Korea , bringing order to Haiti through a bloodless invasion , forcing Saddam Hussein to retreat by quick , direct action  --  some folks just pull on the blinders and refuse to see the truth . <p> I believe it was Georges Clemenceau who suggested that war is too important to be left to the generals . I 'll add that history is too important to be left to the professors . <p> FRED HOLLISTER <p> Alameda <p> . <p> WILL 'S TWISTED LOGIC <p> Editor  --  George Will 's October 19 column ( " The Case for Huffington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely agreeing with his conservative opinions , I have always enjoyed his writing and respected his logic ; in this case , he has turned more twists than an Olympic gymnast in his efforts to find a reason to vote against Dianne Fein stein ( it was interesting to note that even he could n't find a reason to vote for this lightweight version of Dan Quayle ) . <p> Had Mr. Huffington gone to Washington two years ago with the intent of working hard to change opinions and laws with which he disagrees , I would , as usual , read Mr. Will 's column with interest and decide to disagree ; but Mr. Huffington has done nothing to change the system , other than spend his daddy 's money on a senatorial campaign . <p> I , like most Californians , think that Senator Feinstein has shown a rare ability to represent California the way we need to be represented . But even those who disagree should realize that the effectiveness of our next senator is directly related to his or her interest in the job and willingness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's ability to earn a fortune . <p> STEPHAN H. COTTON <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> ' BASHING VS . HAPPY TALK ' <p> Editor  --  I caught your hero on " Larry King Live " the other night . She looked like Richard Nixon in drag . <p> After reading your editorial regarding Huffington 's honesty , I think you might at least be honest enough with your readers to disclose that one of your editors wrote Dianne Feinstein 's biography . Therefore , some of the folks writing this stuff have a direct financial interest in seeing her re-elected . Hence , all the Huffington-bashing and nothing but happy talk about Dianne . <p> I also read that silly piece about how you organize your editorial page for " balance . " It only takes a moment to look back to your sophomoric piece earlier this year that said in essence , " If only we re-elect Bill Clinton in ' 96 and re-elect a Democratic Congress everything will be swell . " The polls would indicate that you are not even on the same page with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be indicated by printing this letter . <p> LELAND W. TOPHAM <p> St. Helena <p> * <p> Editor 's note : Reader Topham apparently missed this statement , published on The Chronicle 's editorial page on July 16 . It appeared in a signed column by Editorial Page Editor Jerry Roberts : <p> " For the record : My unauthorized biography of Senator Dianne Feinstein . . . was written during an unpaid leave of absence from The Chronicle , before I was appointed its Editorial Page Editor , and its content reflects my own reporting and interpretations , not those of the newspaper . <p> " In agreement with Chronicle management , I am refraining from assigning , editing or writing columns or editorials about Feinstein or the Senate campaign , in order to avoid any suggestion or appearance that the book is connected to my work for the paper . " <p> Consequently , Editor Jerry Roberts has not been involved in any matter concerning the Feinstein/Huffington contest . <p> . <p> THE CASE FOR PROP . 185 <p> Editor  --  Your editorial opposing Proposition 185 took far too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic and omitting analysis . Your focus on one project and property owned by one company did not permit your readers to evaluate the crucial questions : <p> 1 . Should gasoline taxes be used to support mass transit ? Prop . 185 says " yes , " providing capital funding for an enormous number of projects which have been on the lists of public agencies around the state . Plus , roughly 20 percent of all taxes collected would support mass transit operations . <p> 2 . Should Caltrans ' overhead be limited to 20 percent on public projects ? Prop . 185 says " yes , " to the horror of government bureaucracy . <p> 3 . Should legislators be forced to use transportation funds for transportation projects ? Prop . 185 prevents legislators from robbing Peter Transportation , as they have for the past two years , and paying Paul Salaries for bureaucrats under the general budget . <p> 4 . What 's the alternative to Prop . 185 ? Quentin Kopp and others say , " Trust us , we 'll get around to developing the projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a long list of projects adding up to $ 6 billion or thereabouts , and there exists something on the order of $ 1 billion in current funding . There is no other funding source in sight . <p> Trust the legislators and the projects go unfunded . Or vote for Prop . 185 and mandate funding . It 's a simple choice . <p> ROBERT F. STARZEL <p> Vice Chairman <p> Southern Pacific Lines <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> BERKELEY YAHOOS <p> Editor  --  Benjamin Macomber , a 27-year-old farmer , picked up his musket and joined his neighbors in the militia one August afternoon in 1777 . He fell to this death the same day while defending a rebel fort on a bluff overlooking the Hudson River , leaving a young widow , a 2-year- old son and his crops in the field . <p> During the " free speech " movement in the late ' 60s , when beautiful Berkeley was being trashed , burned and looted , the death of young Benjamin haunted me . But it was not brought home more closely than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was denied the right to speak about his work in Soviet archives by a mob of Berkeley 's continuing , invading rabble who do not understand the concept of the American Revolution and the resulting Constitution which is the basic instrument of government and the supreme law of the United States . These scabrous yahoos would not understand the definition of freedom of speech if they had it tattooed on their foreheads . <p> Grandpa , you gave up your precious family and your life 's blood for nothing , when your descendants are denied , by violence , the right to hear any public speaker . <p> E.N .
