Section : FINE-TUNING THE FREE MARKET Instead of putting capital into new plants and improved products , America 's CEOs had a better idea : They invested it in themselves <p> Late one night , while waiting for the company limousine , you pour yourself a drink and ponder your life as a CEO : the bonuses , the golden parachute , the private elevator with the polished doors . Perfect  --  or rather , it would be , if it were n't for those busy-body shareholders constantly whining that their stock is stalled . What to do ? Invest in a new plant and expand production ? Pay a few dweebs in white coats to develop some new techno-doohickey that 'll really wow Wall Street ? ... Nah , the very thoughts make you tired . Life is so unfair , you think . If only you could boost stock prices , get rid of some shareholders , and maybe reap a few million bucks for yourself in the process . All without really working . <p> You can . In fact , CEOs have been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret : the stock buyback plan . For a classic demonstration , consider the owners of the Washington Redskins . Back in the early seventies , Jack Kent Cooke , Milton King , and Edward Bennett Williams sat on the board of Pro Football Inc. , the parent company of the Redskins . From that position , they quietly bought out other shareholders to take complete ownership of the team . It was quite an expensive purchase  --  which is why they used other people 's money to make it . <p> During the sixties , George Preston Marshall owned 520 of the 1,000 shares in Pro Football , Williams and his two cohorts held minority positions , and the public held the rest . As Williams came to control more of the daily activities of the company , he directed Pro Football to begin buying back public shares , using company money , for the sole purpose of increasing the board members ' relative share . Then , after Marshall died in 1972 , Williams  --  the executor of Marshall 's estate  --  had Pro Football buy and retire Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $8.8 million , but when they were through , Williams , Cooke , and King owned the entire franchise . <p> Problem was , the Redskins had nowhere near that kind of money . So the trio put Pro Football into debt  --  major debt  --  to finance the purchases . Although the three owners would n't talk , sources at Sports Illustrated and The Washington Post put the debt service alone at between $600,000 and $1 million per year . And Joe Fan picked up the tab . By 1978 , the Redskins had the highest ticket prices in the National Football League . Williams , Cooke , and King had managed to bill consumers  --  in this case ticket buyers  --  to get control of the company , and of its profits . Today , industry watchers estimate that , thanks to soaring TV revenues , the franchise is worth over $150 million , 10 times what it was worth in 1972 . There are no outside stockholders left to benefit from that surge . And Cooke , the only surviving member of the original troika , sure has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of cut-rate tickets ) with the little people who made it all possible . Stock response <p> By now , we 've all heard the cautionary tales : How Kravis , Bass , and other corporate raiders made billions during the eighties while driving American companies into debt , impervious to the impact on jobs or national competitiveness . Stock buybacks have many of the same effects  --  they just work more insidiously , since nobody 's complaining . Last year , U.S. companies bought back more than $12 billion in stock , according to Goldman Sachs partner Steven Einhorn . That money generally did n't result in better cars , lower food prices , or even cheaper tickets to Redskins ' games . It did n't result in leaner , smarter business management . It did n't help us as we slid further into recession , unable to trade our wares in a tight international market . It did result in hefty profits for the executives who engineered the deals . <p> In major food , metal , manufacturing , and other companies across the U.S. , CEOs divert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakthrough production technologies , cleaner waste management , and better-paying jobs . Then they spend it all manipulating the market to enrich themselves and their shareholders . <p> So why have n't you heard about this corporate con ? Because most business managers , stock analysts , and reporters have fallen for the buyback 's illusory benefits . <p> Even the most savvy dailies and trade magazines are infatuated with buybacks . As Quantum Chemical took on crippling loans to finance a buyback , Forbes ran a story called " Saddled with Debt But Still Able to Grow . " A Wall Street Journal story about dividends fueled by buybacks bore the headline , " Metals Producers Are Basking in a Cash Glow , And Move to Share the Luster with Holders . " A Tenneco buyback , announced in the face of takeover threats , was described by Business Week as " potent shark repellent , " even though Tenneco would have to take on $3 billion in debt to finance the purchase . <p> A buyback works like this : Say there are 1 million shares of stock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antimissile missiles . XYZ executives own 500,000 shares of the company , and the other 500,000 are held by various investors . If XYZ officers want to increase earnings per share , or reduce the relative ownership of outsiders and , with it , their influence on the company , they can buy up the public shares , using the company 's money . <p> When the shares are purchased by the company , they are " torn up "  --  they cease to exist , since a company can not own stock in itself . If XYZ executives buy 100,000 shares , for example , they then control 500,000 shares out of 900,000 , or 55.6 percent , instead of the 50 percent they used to control . Why does n't this powerplay gall small investors ? Because of the built-in bonanza : Even if the company 's earnings remain level , they are divided over 900,000 shares instead of 1 million . Thus , earnings per share increase . <p> Furthermore , after a buyback is announced , the share price tends to rise a bit , thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share mean a stock is more valuable , and therefore is worth a higher price . Brokers and analysts recommend that their clients buy XYZ , and the activity further drives up the price per share . <p> So XYZ has more control , the stockholders make more money , and the shares increase in value . What 's so bad about a buyback ? Well , there 's one minor detail : Buying back shares is n't free . If XYZ execs want to buy 100,000 shares , and the shares are trading at $30 , they have to spend $3 million of the company 's money to buy them . <p> That means one of two things : large cuts in the company 's cash flow or , if XYZ 's execs borrow money to complete the transaction , big corporate debt . Either way , huge quantities of cash are diverted from long-term improvements at XYZ  --  say , inventing a more sensitive homing device for the Zealot , decreasing costs of production , accelerating and simplifying delivery during international crises . Such capital investments would surely pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive to nations now smitten with the French competitor . Even a small increase in orders would boost the depressed region where XYZ is located , and possibly give jobs to the 15 percent of the local population now unemployed . But instead , XYZ spends its $3 million on a corporate facelift : the artificial price boost a buyback gives a stock . Unfortunately , like a facelift , that boost usually does n't last long . For proof of that , you do n't need XYZ . Just take a look at the venerable Washington Post , where blind faith in the buyback may ultimately hurt not just its stockholders , but its coverage . Post-mortem <p> Throughout the eighties , Chairman Katharine Graham and her Washington Post Co. used buybacks to drive the share price up and up , to a high of $311 in October 1989 . Then the tide turned against publishing , but Graham 's company kept buying , spending $175 million in the first quarter of 1990 . Instead of going up , the stock price slid down to $250 . The company bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around $190 . Not only did the share price lose ground in 1990 , but earnings per share did as well , dropping more than a dollar from the 1989 $15.50 dividend . President Richard Simmons recently predicted another decrease in earnings per share for 1991 . <p> So , in the long run , the buybacks not only failed to bring better earnings , they virtually ensured a worse Washington Post . In the midst of the recession , with ad lineage off 11 percent from a year ago , the Post could use the hundreds of millions it spent on buybacks to run more stories , hire more reporters , and go after more potential advertisers . But most of that money is gone . <p> The Post was far from alone in its costly infatuation . In the financially roaring eighties , it was indeed hard to find a buyback that did n't work in the short term . The economy was growing , and many companies had more cash on hand than they could handle . So they bought back stock , driving its price up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on junk bonds , even companies that were n't doing well could play the game . <p> After Black Monday , buybacks became even more attractive , as the stock prices of hundreds of companies took a nose dive . Executives at solid firms knew their stock would rebound , at least somewhat , so they bought their own shares because it seemed like a sound investment . The corporate raiding following the crash accelerated the practice . If your company was threatened by a takeover artist , one of your best defenses was to gobble up so much of your own outstanding stock that the raider could not gain control , or to bolster the stock price enough to make the takeover too expensive . <p> Once learned , the buyback proved a tough habit to break . Today , the economy is no longer booming , credit is no longer easy , and the raiding has largely ceased . The stock market has been slipping for almost a year now . The hemorrhaging real-estate market is dragging down investors nationwide , and economists are finally saying the R-word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But many executives are still playing the buyback game . Why ? Because besides offering a short-term gain to shareholders , buybacks often mean a windfall for CEOs . Purina cravings <p> The desire of big stockholders for quarterly profits has driven many a chief executive to forget about long-term strategy . Especially when the chief executive himself is a big stockholder . There 's no better example of this than Ralston Purina , the St. Louis-based owner of everything from dog food to Wonder Bread to Chex Mix . <p> In 1986 , Ralston 's board made a breathtaking offer to the company 's top execs : If the stock price hit $100 and stayed there for 10 consecutive trading days , the executives would take home a bonus of 491,000 free shares , worth a cool $49.1 million . Ralston 's chairman and CEO , William P. Stiritz , would get 160,000 of those shares , three top vice-presidents would get 40,000 shares apiece , and other managers would get smaller awards . At the time , the $100 mark seemed a pretty tall order : Ralston stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass ring was enormous . And to Stiritz , the way to reach it was perfectly clear . <p> Since taking over in 1981 , Stiritz has spearheaded one of the most aggressive and prolonged buyback programs ever seen in the United States . Under him , Ralston has spent almost $3 billion , more than 95 percent of its earnings , on its own stock . By early October 1990 , finally , the grail was in sight . So Ralston directors authorized another buyback of 2 million shares . That put them over the top . Stiritz got his 160,000 shares , worth $16 million . <p> Ralston argues that its stock plan benefited not just Stiritz but all shareholders , and quite handsomely at that ; while the company 's earnings have doubled since Stiritz took over , the per-share profits have quadrupled . But now that the plateau has been reached , Ralston 's stock is going down . Indeed , by early January , the stock price had slipped to $93 . <p> Ralston has always generated a lot of cash : $250 million a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries almost $2 billion in long-term debt , most of it used to finance buybacks . " The buyback has been Ralston 's only game , " says Timothy Ramey , an analyst with County NatWest in New York City . " They have n't done much to improve performance . " <p> Ralston , Coca-Cola , and other cash-rich retailers are particularly susceptible to the buyback disease . Managers at those firms argue that , especially during a recession , buybacks are their safest investment . What if they spent the cash acquiring a company that wound up doing poorly ? Or overspent to develop new products consumers do n't want , and then wasted even more money on large ad campaigns to promote those products ? To them , a buyback is a small risk with a predictable return . <p> Such cautious management may be shortsighted and fainthearted , since risks and sturdy R &D; drive the best American companies . But it also may be disingenuous . A thorough evaluation of a buyback 's merit must include this simple question : Who gains the most ? Clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company 's top executives . And their stock-driven compensation package does not stand alone . " In the last 10 years the emphasis in senior executive pay has shifted from salary and cash awards to stock options , " notes Ted Buyniski of Sibson &; Co. , a Princeton , New Jersey , consulting firm that specializes in compensation . " For many top executives , as much as half their total pay is now tied to increases in stock prices and stock earnings . " <p> The object of stock options , Buyniski says , is to focus executives on measures that increase shareholder wealth . But many executives have concentrated almost exclusively on improving short-term stock performance . With a buyback , they can fulfill their mandate and profit personally as well , without improving the company or its products . " If you ' re going to structure compensation to stock options , " says Buyniski , " tie it to long-term performance . " Unfortunately , only a few companies are taking Buyniski 's advice . Catch-as-catch con <p> Granted , for recession-proof , liquid companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they probably wo n't prove catastrophic . But for companies in industries with cyclical downturns , they can . <p> The real danger of buybacks comes when a company should be using its money to reduce debt or just survive . " If they try a buyback and the stock goes up , but it comes right back down once the buying has stopped , they 've blown the money they could 've used to keep their operations going , " says Len Hyman , an enlightened analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York City . That 's advice several metals companies could stand to heed . <p> North American steel , aluminum , copper , and nickel concerns that were ailing in the early eighties found themselves wading in cash by the end of the decade , thanks to improvements in efficiency made in response to competition from overseas makers . That 's the good news . But while Alcan Aluminum could have used its new money to wipe out its debt , and Phelps Dodge and Inland Steel might 've financed a permanent comeback , pressure from investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired shares , and announced special dividends . <p> Alcan , based in Montreal , has continued on this course . It bought back almost 5 million shares in fiscal 1990 , and then announced in October that it would seek to purchase 15 million more  --  almost 7 percent of its outstanding stock  --  in 1991 . At the October share price of $19.25 , the transaction would cost $480 million . Duncan Curry , Alcan 's manager of investor relations , defends the company 's practice , saying " it would be a fair criticism to say we should use the money to invest in R &D; if we were solely using the money to buy shares , but we budgeted $1 billion in 1991 for a capital spending program . " Besides , he adds , since the metals industry is cyclical , investors want cash when it 's on hand . And the company does what it can to deliver . You can take it with you <p> Of course , resisting stockholders ' shortsighted demands to preserve the long-term health of the corporation takes plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the store . Just ask CBS , which capitulated to the desires of a powerful stockholder who already had both feet in the grave . <p> In December , CBS Inc. announced a huge buyback  --  10 million shares , at a cost of $2 billion . The reason : The estate of company founder William S. Paley , who died in October , found itself with an enormous estate tax bill due by July 1991 . Paley 's family did n't have nearly enough cash , so it initiated discussions with CBS about a buyback . In order not to change the profile of current ownership , CBS decided to make a fixed price , " pro rata " offer , meaning CBS would buy the same percentage of each shareholder 's stake . The company would pay $190 for each share . <p> Paley 's estate , which owned 1.4 million shares , or 5.5 percent of those outstanding , will make $108 million on the deal . But one other entity will also profit greatly  --  Loews Corp. , which owns 24.5 percent of the outstanding shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $125 ; the prorated sale of its stake , at $190 a share , will result in a profit of $165 million . Who runs Loews ? CBS President Laurence Tisch . <p> In December , CBS announced it expected a fourth-quarter loss , the first quarterly loss in the company 's long history . The bad news was caused by a $55 million after-tax loss from coverage of Major League Baseball , lower than anticipated ad revenues , and higher costs sustained by news coverage of the Persian Gulf build up . Fourth-quarter earnings per share , it said , would be down from $1.10 , where they had been each quarter for two years . Furthermore , CBS said it expected " unfavorable earnings " in 1991 because of the worsening advertising climate , continued losses on baseball coverage , and the loss of lucrative contracts to air the Super Bowl and the NBA playoffs . <p> CBS admitted that " the loss of income from the $2 billion used to consummate the buyback offer " will have a " dilutive impact " on earnings per share , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In other words , the usual effect of a buyback  --  increased earnings and stock price  --  will not occur . In fact , due to the announcement of expected losses in 1991 , coupled with the large evaporation of cash , the stock dropped precipitously in January , after the buyback was completed . <p> All this to serve one family 's estate-tax problem . To be fair , William Paley did found the company and was essential to its growth , making his shareholders wealthy in the first place . But the buyback could be a critical blow in a recession . At the very least , it will hurt CBS 's employees . In its 30-page announcement of the buyback and its anticipated effects , CBS noted that to mitigate 1991 losses it will reduce operating costs " wherever possible , " implement " reductions in personnel levels , both by attrition and otherwise , " and reduce " the amount of annual compensation the company pays its affiliated stations . " Whitmanhandled <p> CBS 's buyback will roughly halve the trading value of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $2.3 billion . That 's a virtual invitation to takeover kingpins who , prior to the buyback , would have needed $4 billion to cover outstanding shares . <p> That a buyback would make it easier for a corporate raider is a new twist . Usually it 's the other way around . Defensive buybacks came into vogue after the crash , when raiders like Carl Icahn and Asher Edelman sought to accumulate undervalued stock . Executives responded by buying up outstanding shares to ensure either that the raiders could n't get control or that the stock price would be out of reach . <p> Perhaps in these cases the buyback can be justified as a small sin necessary to prevent a greater one  --  a bogus takeover that would result in the dismantling of a company and the loss of many jobs . Phillips Petroleum , for example , successfully used a buyback plan to fend off T. Boone Pickens Jr . Goodyear repurchased shares to beat back Sir James Goldsmith . <p> But there is a price to be paid for this tactic , and some companies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer goods conglomerate in Chicago best known for its Whitman Sampler chocolates . In September 1988 Whitman was already buying back 500,000 shares a month from the 107 million shares outstanding . Then it announced it would buy back 3.4 million more shares , worth about $125 million , from Carl Pohlad and MEI Diversified Inc. , of which Pohlad was chairman . Whitman feared Pohlad and his clan were seeking control of the company . <p> Whitman borrowed money and got the shares , and Pohlad lost interest . Some observers sympathize with Whitman 's execs , saying they had no other option . But as County NatWest 's Ramey observes , " A takeover might have been the best thing that could have happened for shareholders , considering what 's happened since . " At the time of the Pohlad threat , Whitman 's stock was selling at around $36 . By May 1989 , eight months later , it was at $26 , and Whitman had $1.6 billion in debt . By the end of 1990 the stock was trading at around $18 , and Whitman was selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who needs raiders ? Rediscovering rocket science <p> Looking back over the eighties , Kevin Phillips recently noted that , more and more , people speak of American economic hegemony in the past tense . The buyback is one of the many corporate cons that make such laments ring true . As dividends shrink and the market slides , maybe the very shareholders who benefit from buybacks will start to question why highly paid executives are n't reinvesting revenue to improve the real growth of their companies . <p> " Buybacks are easy , " says Ramey . " They 're not rocket science . Shareholders have to wonder why they 're paying top executives millions of dollars a year if all they do is buy back stock with the cash the company earns . " If more reporters , analysts , and investors began to see through the buyback 's sham virtues , more CEOs would start investing in innovation  --  which would mean a dividend not just for captains of industry and their stockholders , but for dwindling American competitiveness , too . <p> by Mark Fischetti <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts . <p>
