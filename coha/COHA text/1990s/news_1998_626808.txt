<p> TAMPA , Fla. - Before the Tampa Bay Buccaneers can think seriously about Super Bowl XXXIII , they have to figure out a way to beat Green Bay . <p> Last season , the Buccaneers got a whiff of the playoffs , and they liked the smell . But they were 0-3 against the Packers , the third defeat coming in a second-round playoff game at Lambeau Field . <p> Like other NFC teams , the Bucs believe the road to the Super Bowl goes through Green Bay . And they are confident they have the pieces in place to overthrow the Packers and win the NFC Central . <p> " Last season , we were raw and hungry , and we ate the appetizer , " says Bucs guard Jorge Diaz , a three-year veteran from Texas A &M-Kingsville; and a Katy native . " This season , we want to eat the whole meal . " <p> The Tampa-St . Petersburg area is excited about the Buccaneers , who reached the playoffs last season for the first time since 1982 . They proved they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wild-card game . <p> " When I first came here , we were the Tampa Bay Yucks , " says Warren Sapp , one of the best defensive tackles in the NFL . " Now , it 's great to be a Buc . We came from the ruins of this league . Everybody laughed at us . They 're not laughing now . <p> " It 's time for everybody to be excited . This organization has waited too long to have a team like this . We realize what 's at stake . We represent a part of Florida that 's waited too long to have a winner . We 're going to get it done . " <p> Expectations are sky-high . Fans and media believe the Bucs are a bona fide Super Bowl contender . The players are trying to not get caught up in the hype , but it 's almost impossible . <p> " As long as you have realistic expectations , you understand what you 're trying to do , " coach Tony Dungy says . " I think our players understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get into trouble . It 's good for the area to have this excitement , but the players have to keep it in perspective . " <p> Reality is that Green Bay is favored to win the NFC Central . Although the Packers lost several important players through free agency , they remain loaded . And as long as Brett Favre is the quarterback , they will be favored to reach a third consecutive Super Bowl . <p> " They 've got an excellent team with outstanding coaching and great offensive weapons , " Dungy says . " They 've also got a lot of tradition . <p> " I do n't think it 's going to be a situation where they 're going to come back to the rest of us . We 're going to have to improve to catch them . " <p> Sports Illustrated predicts Tampa Bay will reach the Super Bowl . If that happens , the Bucs will have overcome a lot of hardship . <p> Before they move into their new Raymond James Stadium , Tampa Bay will have to play on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NFC Central - the league 's best division - may be the most difficult assignment of all . <p> The Packers , Bucs , Vikings and Lions made the playoffs last season , and all are capable of doing it again . <p> " It makes it sweet to have our measuring stick right in our own division , " Sapp says . " We have six division games against playoff-caliber teams . Hey , I want to play the roughest schedule because it 'll benefit us in the playoffs . " <p> The Bucs have gone from 6-10 to 10-6 in Tony Dungy 's first two seasons as coach . Dungy is loved by his players and respected by the rest of the league . If the players become a mirror image of their coach , they will not be prone to the emotional peaks and valleys that can derail talented teams . <p> " Over the last two seasons , you 've seen us improve and take the steps necessary to reach the next level , " Diaz says . " We learned a lot last season by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overcome hard times . We 've grown up a lot . <p> " Now , you can sense it in the locker room , that everyone is ready to lay it on the line to reach our goals . " <p> Since Rich McKay was promoted to general manager and Dungy was hired as coach , the Bucs ' philosophy has n't changed . They use the draft to build the team . Owner Malcolm Glazer opened the vault to sign players to long-term extensions . <p> When they have a need they do n't fill in the draft , they will use free agency . <p> In the offseason , the Bucs identified two areas of concern : They needed to bolster the receiving corps to give quarterback Trent Dilfer better targets , and they wanted to add depth at cornerback . <p> Atlanta receiver Bert Emanuel , a restricted free agent , was signed . The Buccaneers used their top draft choice on receiver Jacquez Green . They traded up in the second round to get cornerback Brian Kelly . <p> " I think the components are where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started with defense . Then , we made sure to have a sound running game . We had to get a quarterback we liked and make sure he could play within our scheme . And we wanted speed . " <p> The Bucs have a rare combination of speed and power on both sides of the ball . <p> Their running game is built around 248-pound fullback Mike Alstott , who has missed the first three preseason games because of a hip injury , and 5-8 , 178-pound halfback Warrick Dunn , the NFL 's Offensive Rookie of the Year last season . <p> Adding Emanuel and Green at receiver with Reidel Anthony gives Tampa Bay one of the speediest units in the league . <p> The defense features linemen who explode off the ball and linebackers who run like backs . <p> " I 've always been a coach who likes speed , " Dungy says . " Speed gives you a chance to make big plays . That 's one of the things we did n't have two years ago . But speed and quickness are such an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " <p> The Bucs are confident they wo n't be one-year wonders . They feel they have too much talent on offense , defense and special teams to go backward . They have a coaching staff that knows how to handle players . <p> About the only thing that could interrupt their playoff plans would be an inordinate number of injuries to key players . <p> " We 've got a close-knit team , " McKay says . " Tony creates a working environment that brings the players together . It 's peaceful and family-oriented . " <p> Going to a Bucs game is going to be an event . Every seat for every game is sold out at the new stadium , and so many luxury suites were sold , they decided to add more . And those sold instantly . <p> In one end zone , the Glazer family forked over $ 3 million for Pirate Cove . The area will include a pirate ship more than 100 feet long . Cannons will shoot confetti when the Bucs score . Cheerleaders will dance on the ship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-of-the-art scoreboard that features several screens . Fans can come early to watch pre-game shows or other games . <p> " Everything starts with the head man , " Sapp says , referring to Dungy . " He 's great to play for . You never find him too high or too low , yelling , ranting and raving . Whenever you have somebody like that steering your ship , it 's a lot easier to do the things we need to do to be great in this league . <p> " When your head man is that calm and collected , it trickles down . He 's not a dramatic , in-your-face guy , and we appreciate that . He just expects each man to do his job . He gets a lot of productivity with that philosophy . " <p> <p> From Yucks to Bucs <p> The Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1983-1997 : <p> Playing under five head coaches , the Bucs were 91 games under .500 - 58-149 - from 1983-95 . <p> In 1996 , under new head coach Tony Dungy ( pictured ) , the Buccaneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their last seven . <p> In 1997 , the Bucs began 5-0 and eventually won their final game for a 10-6 finish that earned them a home playoff date , in which they beat the Lions . Tampa Bay lost at Green Bay in the second round .
