Sure , those first moments are magical , but in the weeks and months that follow , there 's plenty you can do to connect with your infant // BONDING HAS BECOME A BIRTHING BUZZWORD that , unfortunately , somehow suggests a superglue approach to the parent-infant relationship : Put the baby and parents together at the critical moment , when the glue is wet , and they 're stuck together for life ; miss that moment , and the glue will never properly set . Of course , human relationships do n't work that way . Bonding is an ongoing process , like falling in love or building a friendship . It 's one that 's best described by the phrase " growing attached . " The parent-baby bond deepens with time , and there are some very good reasons to encourage it . Research shows , for instance , that a secure motherinfant attachment helps keep the baby 's hormones in balance . Bonding also encourages an outpouring of the hormones prolactin and oxytocin , which are thought to function as biological helpers , giving moms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be the biological basis of the concept of mother 's intuition . What do you need to fully connect with your child ? I call the behaviors that promote closeness the " baby B 's . " Birth Bonding The first hour after birth is prime time for mother and infant . In their classic book Maternal-Infant Bonding , published in 1976 , Marshall H. Klaus , M.D. , and John H. Kennell , M.D. , described a " sensitive period " just after birth when mothers and newborns are biologically programmed to respond to each other . The baby needs the comfort of the mother 's warm skin and soft abdomen , and the mother needs to see , smell , and touch the baby she has worked hard to deliver . In attending more than a thousand births over the past 30 years , I 've seen how within minutes of delivery a newborn enters a state of quiet alertness , in which she looks directly into her mother 's eyes and snuggles at her breasts . Perhaps she 's so enthralled that she does n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually falls contentedly to sleep . In this first meeting , a baby learns to whom she belongs . This helps babies develop the single most valuable quality they need in order to grow into secure children and adults-trust in their environment . How is early bonding accomplished ? In the delivery room : Ask to delay certain routine procedures ( but for no more than an hour ) . For instance , the antibiotic placed in a newborn 's eyes may temporarily blur her vision or cause her to keep her eyes closed . She needs a clear first impression of you , and you need to see her eyes . Photograph Gaze into those baby blues : Eye-to-eye contact is key to bonding Photograph See me , hear me , feel me : Engage all your baby 's senses at that precious first meeting // Skin-to-skin contact is vital , so hold your infant as soon as possible . If you 've had a cesarean section and your arms are encumbered by IVs and pulse monitors , have your husband hold the baby 's cheek against yours while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital room : If you 're able , keep the baby with you all or most of the time ( a practice called " rooming in " ) . When a newborn spends all his time in a nursery , his periods of quiet alertness are wasted in a bassinet . And when he begins to cry a nurse responds initially , not his mother . This is unfortunate because the early phase of an infant 's cry is the perfect signal-disturbing enough to prompt a comforting response , but not so unsettling as to make the listener want to avoid the baby . By the time a nurse can get a crying baby to his mother , his cries may have escalated into a shrill squalling , so that the mom is presented with an anxious , frightened baby who can be difficult to soothe and feed . However , when a baby awakens in his mother 's arms or with his mother nearby , she can respond immediately to his first whimpers . Soon the mother learns to recognize her newborn 's pre-cry clues , such as squirming or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a clean diaper right away . This way the baby learns that he does n't have to cry , at least not in a disturbing way , to get what he needs . Breast-feeding Nursing is an exercise in baby reading . Your infant 's body language tells you when she needs to eat , when she 's had enough , and when she wants to breastfeed for comfort . My wife , Martha , who nursed all of our eight children , says , " I could even tell when a baby had an ear infection just by the way she behaved at the breast . " Breastfeeding stimulates the production of hormones in the mother that help her feel calm , relaxed , and loving . For instance , prolactin levels increase 10- to 20-fold within 30 minutes after a woman begins breastfeeding . Prolactin is a short-acting substance that mostly disappears within an hour and a half , so to get the best response a mother must nurse frequently-ideally , whenever and as often as the baby wants to eat ; scheduling an infant 's breast-feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bottle-feed can achieve the same degree of closeness with her baby as one who nurses by responding promptly to her infant 's cries . Besides giving her a bottle when she 's hungry , give her your eyes , your voice , and your caresses . Wear short sleeves and , if practical , open your shirt so that your baby can feel your skin . Hold the bottle alongside your breast and look into her eyes . You want her to feel that the bottle is part of you . Above all , do n't prop the bottle up . There should always be a person at the other end of a baby 's bottle . Baby Wearing Beginning in the early weeks , hold your infant in your arms or " wear " him in a baby carrier that straps onto your body as often as is practical and enjoyable for both of you . ( A sling-type carrier works best . ) By being nestled close to a parent-Mom or Dad-a baby becomes intimately involved in that parent 's world . He goes where the parent goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Baby wearing improves the sensitivity of parents as well . Babies who are carried more cry less , and thus are more fun to be with . Some things to remember : In the beginning , support your baby with your arms and hands ; you can let loose after you become accustomed to balancing his weight and position . Do n't wear your baby while cooking , cycling , or riding in a car . Wearing him while you eat is fine , but put him safely in his crib or bouncy seat if you plan to drink a hot beverage . A splash of hot coffee could scald his scalp or face . Practice wrapping your arm around your infant as you make a sudden move ; this way , preventing him from falling out will be second nature if you ever do have to twist or turn suddenly . Bend at the knees , not the waist , whenever you have to pick up something from the floor . Do n't be a fanatic . Wear your baby as much as you can , but do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bed Sharing Although controversial , inviting a baby to sleep with her parents can be beneficial to the bonding process . Breastfeeding mothers , for instance , find that sleeping with their baby helps them get a good night 's rest : Nursing stimulates the release of hormones that have a tranquilizing effect on a mom ; at the same time , breast milk contains a sleep-inducing protein that helps an infant sleep . By slumbering together , a mother and baby can enjoy these benefits without having to get up repeatedly during the night . Bed sharing can be a wonderful way to accomplish " catchup " bonding between a parent and infant whose together time got off to a slow start due to prematurity or another medical condition that temporarily separated them . Bed sharing also is valuable for parents who have little time during the day with their baby . If you want your baby to sleep in your bed , keep the following in mind : To guard against sudden infant death syndrome , it 's best to place the baby on her back to sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface or a water bed ; remove any extra pillows or covers from the bed . For safety , do n't wear nightclothes with ribbons or ties , and never sleep with a baby if you have been drinking or are taking medicine that might make you sleep deeply . Boundary Building When a baby is between 6 and 9 months old , parents need to begin setting limits and making rules . Saying no is as important to bonding as saying yes , but it 's vital to understand the child 's point of view ; I call this approach " getting behind the eyes of the child . " By imagining what your child might be feeling when he misbehaves or causes an accident , you can handle the situation in a way that will help your child understand his limits without making him feel he 's simply being fussed at . I like to use the " takeand-give " strategy . For example , you may say to a baby who 's doing something you do n't want him to , " You may not play with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can use this disciplinary tactic as a child grows older . Once , for instance , when our daughter Lauren was 2 1/2 , she spilled juice all over the floor while trying to pour it for herself . Martha knelt beside her and , seeing that Lauren was upset , thought , " If I were Lauren , how would I want my mother to act ? " So she simply handed her a rag and the two of them wiped up the mess together . Lauren learned that the proper response to a spill was to just clean it up , and also was reminded that her mom was closely attuned to her feelings , thereby strengthening the deep bond they 'd already established . Balance Parents who focus exclusively on their baby and ignore their own needs get burned out : There may come a time when bonding feels more like bondage . One woman and her 10-month-old daughter came to our office for counseling . The baby was very clingy , and whined as soon as her mother put her on the floor . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her arms . The mother 's anxiety was reinforcing the child 's fussiness . One of the beauties of being connected is that your child is able to read your body language . I suggested that this mom try what I call the " no problem , baby " approach . The next time her baby whimpered to be picked up , I advised the mom to turn toward her , briefly acknowledge her with a relaxed , happy face , and resume her adult conversation as if no problem existed . This conveyed an attitude of " you can handle this , Mama 's here . " After the mother tried this , the child stopped crying and began playing on her own . As the mother learned to balance her own needs with her baby 's , she felt more relaxed . Bonding with a baby happens gradually ; it 's not a onetime event . The baby B 's are not a secret formula , but commonsense strategies that can help mothers , fathers , and babies get connected .
