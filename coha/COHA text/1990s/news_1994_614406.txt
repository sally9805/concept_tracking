<p> Kenneth Stein has made a career out of studying the Middle East . <p> Robert Pastor 's passion is Latin America . <p> Richard Joseph is an expert on Africa . <p> Ellen Mickiewicz knows the former Soviet Union like the back of her hand . <p> Most of the time they are erudite college professors lecturing in Emory University classrooms and grading term papers . <p> But when Jimmy Carter calls , they drop everything . <p> Like Superman , who dodges into a phone booth , they dash home to grab their passports and pack . They follow Carter to hot spots around the globe . Sometimes they wind up dodging bullets in Bosnia and Haiti . <p> " It 's a very heady experience , " Stein says . <p> As Carter Center fellows and program directors , these experts tell the former president what he needs to know . If the Carter Center is a mini-State Department of the South , these Emory professors are Carter 's Cabinet . <p> So far this year , Carter has grabbed headlines with high-profile peacemaking missions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bosnia . Before that , he made news when he monitored elections in Nicaragua , Panama and other Latin American countries in the late 1980s and early ' 90s . <p> But most of the work done at the Carter Center goes unnoticed . <p> Since it was founded in 1982 , the center has sent its experts to toil quietly for peace , human rights and democracy around the world . <p> As silent partners in Carter 's quest to improve the world , they travel to Liberia , Sudan and half a dozen republics in the former Soviet Union . The center also has health and agriculture programs in Africa . <p> It is all part of Carter 's post-presidential master plan to " wage peace " around the world . This notion has steadily taken shape in a cluster of offices on a hilltop overlooking Atlanta . <p> Too young to retire when he left the White House , Carter focused his energy on improving life in impoverished pockets of the world . And he redefined the post-presidency in the process . <p> " In most cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carter has said . " It is my life 's work . " <p> The center 's beginning <p> The Carter Presidential Library , which holds 27 million documents from the White House years , opened in 1986 . But the real work happens in the adjoining nonprofit think tank called the Carter Center . <p> " The whole purpose of the Carter Center was to be proactive , action- oriented and results-driven , " said Stein , director of the center 's Mideast programs . " He did n't want to produce books that ended up on shelves and the top floors of libraries . He wanted to make a difference , because he has this attitude that one person can make a difference . " <p> As president , Carter had little time for in-depth study of any particular issue . But at the Carter Center , with his own experts , he started asking questions . He focused on foreign policy . <p> " It gave him the chance to sit at the foreign policy table and fill himself up , " said Stein , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He could n't get enough in the mid- ' 80s . He wanted more . " <p> His staff flooded his office with maps , briefing books and background papers on the Middle East , Latin America , Africa and Russia . <p> " He has this wonderful thirst for information , " Stein said . " He loves geography . He loves maps . He absorbs incredible vats of data , pulling information from here and there . " <p> Over time , though , Carter wanted more . He wanted action . <p> It was a difficult adjustment for the professors like Stein , used to the steady pace of academia . <p> They liked to study what had already happened . They were less interested in making things happen . <p> ' If President Carter got impatient , sometimes it was because we dwelled too much on historical precedent , " Stein said . <p> Carter has freedom to push the envelope <p> As a freelance peacemaker , Carter answers to no one . This gives him the freedom to push the envelope if he thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travels as " a representative of the Carter Center . " <p> He keeps the official U.S. and U.N . diplomats fully informed of activities , but acknowledges that they do n't always approve . <p> He is stubborn . Determined . Tenacious . Tireless . And deeply religious . He 's been called a naive egomaniac . He 's often criticized for meddling in foreign affairs and changing U.S. policy in midstream . <p> He has a penchant for embracing dictators and other " unsavory characters , " but he makes no apologies . Someone has to talk to these guys , he says . After all , they are the ones who can choose to make peace . Often what he says abroad can sound bizarre to Americans back home . One instance occurred in Bosnia last week , while Carter was at Serb headquarters in Pale . <p> Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said Americans did not fully understand the Bosnian war because of media bias against the Serbs . Carter said his visit might provide " a rare chance to let the world know the truth and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Asked to explain later , Carter implied that his reply was at least partly a negotiating tactic , meant to win Karadzic 's trust . <p> Stein added that " it 's part of the process " of negotiating . <p> " When he gets engaged , as one of his preconditions , he accepts the notion that these guys are n't the nicest people in the world . But he 's willing to put aside their immediate past so he can get to the real reason he is negotiating with them : he 's doing it in order to save some lives , " Stein said . <p> Carter never travels alone . The Secret Service is always two steps ahead and behind , and several assistants take care of his travel arrangements . <p> Carter is paid no consulting fee when he mediates conflicts . In Haiti , he flew on a U.S. military plane " because he was asked by President Clinton to go , " said Carrie Harmon of the Carter Center . " In other cases , he pays his own way or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government . " <p> The Carter Center operates on a $ 25 million annual budget . It receives no government support except for grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development . <p> When Carter globe-trots , the Carter Center fellow who is an expert in the region goes along to take notes , arrange important meetings and keep in touch with U.S. officials by fax and phone . <p> " We work from 5 in the morning until way past 12 at night , " said Stein , who has traveled with Carter to the Middle East many times . " We provide ideas , briefings , background information , meetings with the press , companionship . We give him ideas for speeches and presentations . " <p> Joyce Neu , who traveled with Carter to Bosnia , said it was a sobering experience . <p> " The pace of the entire trip was really amazing , " she said . " It all happened very quickly . " <p> One week she was typing out reports on Bosnia 's key political players and peace plans . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter 's motorcade as it sped through war-torn Sarajevo . It was the only one in the convoy that was n't bulletproof . She prayed that no snipers had her in their cross hairs . <p> Sometimes , Carter 's experts get left behind . During the Haiti negotiations , when Clinton ordered Carter 's team to stop talking and get out of Haiti , Pastor was told to stay . Carter wanted him to make sure the peace agreement was honored . <p> What 's next for the former president ? <p> After Haiti , North Korea and Bosnia , one wonders where Carter will go next . <p> He gets dozens of pleas for help each week . Most of them he can not address . But often , he 'll write a letter or make a phone call on behalf of a priest , politician or activist who has been unjustly imprisoned . And even though no one may ever know he played a role , Carter will do what he can to make a difference . <p> He probably will go to the Middle East next spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Palestinians and the Israelis . And he will check with the White House and State Department to be sure they do n't object . <p> But in the end , it will be his decision . And he will probably add another notch to his humanitarian belt . <p> " I think what we created at the Carter Center is the definition for what the post-presidency can be , " said Stein . " He has set an incredible standard for others to emulate . But I do n't think any others will be able to do it . They do n't have his drive , energy and intellectual capacity . "
