<p> In 1964 , the visionary Wilderness Act postulated that humans could learn to restrain their own actions , and promoted an ethic that people should walk upon the land so as to leave no scars from their passing . In the 21st century , those ideas will grow more urgent globally . For today , our generation faces several interrelated , pressing decisions . Whether we directly address them or ignore them will determine what kind of a planet we leave for our grandchildren . <p> ' The issue today is no longer just preserving a piece of pretty land , ' said former Colorado Gov . Dick Lamm . ' Now we 're literally talking about global survival . ' <p> Lamm , currently at a University of Denver think tank , worries that ' We have small solutions chasing gargantuan problems , and the problems are outrunning the solutions . ' <p> Other leaders are optimistic . ' The important thing that has changed is that today the environment is on everybody 's agenda , ' said Tim Wirth , head of the U.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wirth , who also is a former U.S. undersecretary of State and former U.S. senator from Colorado , believes solutions will require thoughtful , long-term planning . <p> Today 's environmental problems are like a cascade of worry , tumbling from one pool of trouble into another . <p> Population growth . The torrent starts with humanity 's proclivity to multiply . The evidence is as close as traffic jams on Interstate 25 or as far as famine in Africa . There are more than 6 billion humans now . By the middle of the new century , our species may number 18 billion , the United States ' population could stand at a half billion , and Colorado likely will have more than 5 million residents . <p> Yet there is reason for modest optimism , said Robert Engleman , vice president of research for Population Action International . Humans did n't hit the 6 billion mark as early as experts feared . Our reproductive rate has slowed , thanks to better access to birth control worldwide and the improved economic status of women , particularly in developing countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if couples limit themselves to just two children , there still will be more births than deaths , and the human population will grow , not on a straight-line curve , but by many multiples . The bottom line : We can not let up on family planning efforts , or we will face catastrophe . The United States could be doing a much better job , Engleman said . For one thing , it has stepped back from its leadership as a family planning advocate , letting partisan bickering over domestic abortion laws derail its international policies . <p> For another - and this statistic is truly shameful - half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned . By contrast , worldwide the figure is only 38 percent . <p> However , the United States also must revamp its outdated immigration policies , which are the source of much of its population boom , Lamm said . <p> Even Colorado 's own policies ignore hard realities , Lamm said . Recently , Gov . Bill Owens announced a proposal to manage growth , but Lamm believes it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good intentions , ' I do n't see Colorado doing anything differently than L.A. did 30 years ago . ' <p> Resource depletion , global warming . Population growth mixed with unbridled consumerism makes a horrific recipe . <p> Per person , the United States uses more energy , water and farmland than any other nation - in fact , the average American consumes about 38 times the natural resources as the average Asian . As other countries emulate the U.S. lifestyle , they too will begin to burn more fossil fuels and consume more resources . <p> Internationally , as China , with its soon-to-be 1.5 billion inhabitants , increasingly burns its vast coal reserves , its weak air-pollution laws will make the smog-choked skies of Europe 's Industrial Revolution look pristine by comparison . <p> Nationally , Congress has surrendered meaningful support for alternative energy . <p> In Colorado , more than half of all automobiles sold are sport utility vehicles . Yet , existing federal and state laws let them burn more gas and spew out far more pollutants than the average sedan . <p> Stricter standards for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven years , the Clinton administration ignored the need to patch the obvious gap in pollution control laws . Only last week did the president recommend stricter standards . But because the plan appeared so late in Clinton 's lame-duck term , it could get lost in election-year politics . <p> Meantime , Congress is being lobbied to open one of North America 's most delicate ecosystems , the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , to oil production . <p> Meantime , Colorado 's communities keep approving new developments without asking where their water will come from long-term . A shocking number of Colorado communities have no plans for coping with drought . Many , especially in Douglas County , use ground water for their domestic supplies - yet it 's not clear how many years of heavy draw-down these aquifers can tolerate . Unless Coloradans restrict their water consumption , there will be increasing pressure to build new water projects that could , in turn , further damage already over stressed ecosystems . <p> Against this backdrop , evidence continues to mount that global warming is a real phenomenon and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning of fossil fuels . Many scientists believe an increase of only a few degrees in the average temperature could inflict massive climate changes , flooding coastal cities and drying up vital farm land . <p> As with population growth , humans have their destiny in their own hands . For example , Ford Motor Co. recently quit the Global Climate Coalition , an industry group trying to block new laws to curb global warming . <p> Another sign corporate America may be turning green : Home Depot , one of the country 's largest home improvement chains , has promised it will no longer sell lumber from old-growth forests . <p> Economic Justice . For years , the United States has promoted free trade to improve its own economic standing , and , it claims , to help other nations do likewise . Judging by our country 's prosperity , the policy has succeeded . <p> Globally , the truth is murkier . More people live in abject poverty than ever in history , and the gap between the haves and have-nots is widening . Developing countries thus consider U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preservation - blatant hypocrisy . In essence , the United States is foisting the damage of its own resource-intensive lifestyle on others . <p> The paradox concerns even American industry leaders . For instance , the United States has drastically reduced how much timber it cuts from its own national forests , but the country still needs vast quantities of lumber . Much of that wood comes from developing countries where , unlike on U.S. forests , there are little or no environmental regulations . ' So all we 're really doing is exporting our environmental issues , ' said Tom Troxel , head of the Intermountain Forest Industry Association . <p> But increasingly , scientists , environmentalists and even economists are challenging the existing paradigm . Clean air , clean water , decent living conditions and respect for the natural world are n't luxuries , but the basis for a good quality of life for all people , the challengers assert . No economy can be sustainable if it wrecks the environment upon which our species ' survival depends . <p> An educated public now understands that it 's possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wirth . <p> The recent protests in Seattle alerted many Americans to the policies of the World Trade Organization , and ' blew a big hole of sunshine into a very old-fashioned process , in which only a few people sitting around a table were making decisions for the rest of us . <p> ' The world does n't work that way anymore , ' Wirth added . <p> ' I think it will take a real change of consciousness , ' Lamm said . ' It will take a change from the endless growth model to the sustainability model of economics . It will still be a good life , but people will have to really think : What is the impact of our decisions today upon tomorrow , and how do we leave an environment intact for our children ?
