Computer visualization brings complex aspects of life into view <p> It 's no big deal to sketch a water molecule , with its two hydrogen atoms linked to an oxygen , or to picture how those atoms interact with another substance . But when molecules contain hundreds or thousands of atoms , even a brilliant chemist has trouble keeping them all straight , never mind tracking how each atom moves or changes when confronted with other molecules . <p> Nor does the challenge end with molecules . Researchers , teachers , and physicians want to compile the massive amounts of data acquired through various imaging and analytical technologies in order to make and manipulate clear pictures of cells , organs , even entire organisms . <p> That 's where computers , particularly computer graphics , come in . By incorporating computational and visualization techniques into their experimental repertoire , researchers can make sense of ever more complex data and substances . X-ray crystallographers , for example , have demonstrated that amino acids , the building blocks of proteins , form chains that twist into incredibly convoluted configurations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helper molecules . <p> " But from my point of view , that 's just the beginning , " says Arthur J. Olson of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , Calif . <p> Like other computational chemists and molecular biologists , Olson has built on those data and , with certain mathematical procedures , has reenacted molecular minglings . " That 's really the crucial aspect of biology , " adds Michael Colvin of Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore , Calif . <p> As part of these efforts , researchers have become artists , sketching with a keyboard instead of pastels . Each new line of computer code , each faster chip has brought a little more of the world beyond our vision into view . Sometimes , the scientists ask the computer simply to compile all the data into a comprehensible picture , one based totally , or as much as possible , on existing physical and chemical laws . Other times , researchers tap the ' computer program 's intuition to filter out unimportant data and fill in missing details . " Visualization lets you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , " says Helen M. Berman , an X-ray crystallographer at Rutgers University in New Brunswick , N.J. <p> Berman remembers the early days of computer graphics , when images came only in black , white , and shades of gray . " I thought , What do we need color for ? It 's just a luxury , " she recalls . Now , she realizes how much better colors are at capturing the personalities of molecules . The bright blues , yellows , and purples help experts as well as novices make sense of what sometimes seems little more than a tangled mess of squiggles or  --  in the case of ultrasound data  --  a fuzzy image . <p> Already , an explosion in visualization techniques has revolutionized the depiction and analysis of molecules . <p> But computer graphics experts and their scientist-collaborators have not stopped there . They are also portraying , in ever clearer detail , cell membranes and the development of chick embryos . They are even attempting to make picture-perfect ultra-sound images of the human fetus ( see sidebar ) . <p> Recently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collagen , the one major protein motif left for X-ray crystallographers to decipher . Collagen is a protein in bone and connective tissue that forms from three parallel chains of amino acids that twist counterclockwise into spirals . Those spirals extend down a common axis , they report in the Oct. 7 SCIENCE . The spirals hold together because of a repetitive sequence : Every third amino acid is glycine , which allows the strands to lie close together . Should another amino acid replace the glycine , the collagen might become flexible or unstable and cause disease , Berman says . <p> Interestingly , a single switch between a glycine and an alanine made crystallization , the first step in this kind of analysis , possible , Berman notes . To obtain a crystal , her group made and dissolved protein fragments that were 30 amino acids long , each with collagen 's repetitive sequence  --  and each with this one switch . The substitution leads to a slight unraveling , noticeable in an image with amino acids shown as little bubbles ( A ) . When the fragments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes less evident , but the spiraling of the three chains into a triple helix becomes much clearer , she points out . " You see different things depending on the type of representation . " At Yale University , Paul B. Sigler and his colleagues looked at molecules called chaperonins , which help proteins fold into their final shapes . In the Oct. 13 NATURE , he and his colleagues describe the structure of a bacterial chaperonin , GroEL . <p> Picture an iced doughnut divided into seven equal pieces and placed upside down on a similarly iced and divided doughnut . Each of the 14 slices consists of 547 amino acids . The amino acids occupy particular positions in the slices and arrange into three layered sections , or domains . The innermost , icing domains link the doughnuts . Pieces of the middle domains reach across and touch adjacent slices , while the outermost domains form the opening of this central cavity . <p> Even this description fails to tell the whole story . Imagine now that some hungry youngster had decided to taste each of the 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of each . These portals extend deep into the slice and probably provide the chaperonin with a place for processing energy-transfer molecules called ATP , Sigler notes . Not all the graphics generated by Sigler 's group show all these details ( C ) . <p> Based on these structural data , Yale colleague Arthur L. Horwich made specific changes in the amino acids of the GroEL central cavity . The modified GroEL could no longer hold onto proteins , indicating that GroEL corralled proteins in its core , Horwich reported , also in the Oct. 13 NATURE . <p> Like Sigler and Berman , Olson was schooled as an X-ray crystallographer . Early in his career , he wanted to know the structure of the proteins that surround the genetic material in viruses . Based on the first batch of data he and his colleagues collected , he built a model out of brass parts . However , that model proved useless in his quest to understand how the proteins self-assembled to make the viral coat . " That 's when I realized that we really needed more flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spends as much time developing computer software  --  his " flexible tools "  --  as analyzing molecular interactions . His programs enable him to " see " a molecule in any number of ways ( D ) . " They do n't look like anything from the traditional view , because molecules are smaller than the wavelength of visible light , " Olson explains . " But visualization is a way of taking that structure and representing it in an interpretable way for the questions you are seeking answers to . " <p> He can look at the bonds between atoms or ask the computer to draw a Space-filling version , whose soap-bubble appearance indicates the volume taken up by the various molecular components . He can highlight the backbone of a protein to get a clearer view of how it folds . Or the computer can pinpoint surfaces exposed to the outside environment or delineate the distribution of electrical charges . <p> Those images help Olson and others take the next step  --  determining how one molecule links to another ( see cover ) . They are also refining software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E ) . This second program represents the surfaces of proteins at greater and greater resolutions as it searches for and finds the regions where proteins can bind together , Olson explains . With each iteration , the program rules out connections that prove energetically or structurally untenable and fine-tunes those that seem likely , eventually homing in on the optimal orientations . <p> At Sandin , Colvin , too , investigates molecular connections . For one project , he portrayed a carcinogen attacking DNA ( F ) . " The DNA has grooves , and the carcinogen just drops down into these grooves like a key into a slot , " he says . <p> Students , too , are reaping the benefits of these representations of the invisible world . At Purdue University in West Lafayette , Ind. , Clark D. Gedney and his colleagues have developed several visualization procedures for teaching biology . One teaching tool incorporates pictures of cross sections of chick embryos taken at different stages of development ( G ) . Gedney 's team added colors to highlight the various tissues and had the computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuss with mounting and viewing microscope slides , students click a computer mouse to see embryos at 13 stages of development . They can look at it whole or in cross section , notes Gedney . <p> Finally , another simulation enables both teachers and students to build their own cell membranes and then examine the effect of adding or removing an electron from the membrane ( H ) . The computer program makes sure the membrane works just as a real one does , Gedney says . <p> PHOTO : A : Collagen 's blue , purple , and green amino acid strands with the alanine substitute in yellow . <p> PHOTO : B : Ribbons show the spirals in collagen 's three strands . <p> PHOTO : C : GroEL viewed from above with some domains colored . <p> PHOTO : D : Four sections of a hemoglobin molecule ( clockwise from upper right ) : Space-filling balls show relative size and distribution of hydrogen ( white ) , carbon ( black ) , oxygen ( red ) , and nitrogen ( blue ) atoms ; yellow tubes depict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped heme group ; green indicates parts exposed to the environment ; and atoms ( white spheres ) create positive ( blue ) and negative ( red ) electrostatic fields that influence protein-protein interactions . <p> PHOTO : E : A close-up shows that some parts of two protein ( white , magenta ) surfaces are nearer ( yellow ) than others ( green ) . <p> PHOTO : F : Carcinogen ( yellow ) binding to DNA . <p> PHOTOS : G : Two views of chick embryos ; lines show locations of the cross section portrayed . <p> PHOTO : H : Visualization of a cell membrane with an incoming electron ( red ) . <p> By By ELIZABETH PENNISI <p>
