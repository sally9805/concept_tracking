DURING HIS EIGHT YEARS at TIME , Michael Duffy has studied the mysteries of the Pentagon , covered the Gulf War as a pool reporter on the cruiser U.S.S. Fox and examined the workings of the Bush presidency . But , says the White House correspondent , few stories have proved as daunting as this week 's attempt to understand and describe the way President Clinton arrives at decisions , " The State of Bill Clinton . " <P> $ Duffy spoke with 70 White House officials for the story , but he still believes that he has only glimpsed the inner workings of this President 's mind . At least he is n't alone : many members of the White House staff Duffy interviewed were equally mystified by their boss 's approach to running the country . " When we want to torture people , we make them draw a flow chart of how decisions are made , " joked a senior official . Says Duffy : " In the Bush White House , if I could get to any of three key people , I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two dozen people to get to , but as often as not there is no agreement about what something means . " <P> A year into the Clinton Administration , Duffy is still struck by the contrast between this President and his predecessor . It is , he says , the difference " between covering a game of checkers and a game of three- dimensional chess . Clinton is a much more complex politician than Bush , and his agenda is as sprawling as his management style . " The Bush White House ran with almost military precision , even when its direction was unclear , Duffy says , while Clinton and his staff have a strong sense of direction but are constantly rushing to catch up with themselves . In person , Duffy finds the two Presidents quite dissimilar . Despite Clinton 's reputation for seeking instant intimacy , he is far less accessible than Bush , who loved to schmooze with reporters . <P> If the Clinton White House is more wary of the press than the Bush Administration was , senior White House officials still appreciate good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in the White House Bulletin , an insider newsletter , Duffy was the runaway leader in the voting for the best newsweekly reporter . " He knows the people here pretty well and can read between the lines , " one official is reported as saying . Duffy expresses horror at the thought of receiving praise from notoriously manipulative sources , noting ruefully that " this may be a very dubious honor . "
