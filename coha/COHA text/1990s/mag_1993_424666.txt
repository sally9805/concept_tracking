<p> Founded in 1966 as the community outreach branch of Arena Stage , the Living Stage Theatre Company of Washington , D.C. uses the art of improvisational theater to affect social change . The company 's work is centered around individuals who typically do not have access to opportunities for creative development . Working directly with children , teens and adults from high risk environments , Living Stage strives to create theater in which there is a direct connection between the art form and the lives of the Company 's participants and audience . <p> This process combines performances on themes of relevant social issues  --  such as drug abuse , AIDS , teenage pregnancy and suicide  --  with workshops based on improvisational theater techniques . Special needs audiences that include economically disadvantaged children and youth , physically and emotionally abused children and adolescents and young people struggling to overcome substance abuse are actively engaged in the creative process . <p> The Living Stage approach and environment are designed to involve participants emotionally , intellectually , and physically . Workshop exercises are geared to enhance self-esteem and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team-building and socialization . <p> Living Stage is comprised of a resident ensemble of professional actor-educators , a music director , and full-time administrative and production staffs . The Company 's $700,000 annual budget is covered by contributions and grants from individuals , foundations , corporations , and federal and local government , and through earned income contracts . <p> The content of Living Stage 's work deals primarily with the concerns of Washington , D.C. 's African-American community . Several years ago , the company acquired and and renovated a facility in the heart of what was once considered the city 's " Black Broadway . " Children Raising Children <p> In 1991 , Living Stage launched the " Teen Mothers of Today " intiative , focusing its intensive work with teens on a group of young mothers between the ages of 13 and 16 . The project has a projected 3-year cycle slated to end in 1994 . It is hoped , notes Living Stage founder-director Robert Alexander , that the extended association of these young mothers with the Living Stage philosophy of empowerment through creativity will positively affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their community . <p> Alexander observes , " We want to motivate these young mothers to go beyond their self-imposed limitations and discover the powerful , artistic genius within . Experience has shown that direct involvement in creative activities can help develop personal qualities that are needed to overcome many of life 's obstacles . " <p> With the exponential growth in the numbers of teens giving birth , the mission of Living Stage as artist/educator must include more than one generation at a time , for now the " children " of today are simultaneously raising the children of tomorrow . This next generation will be raised primarily by women . <p> Because of the current epidemic of rampant violence directed toward African-American males , most media and budget attention fails to acknowledge the potential crisis among the women and children who are the survivors . What values will they take with them to maturity ? Is it possible for them to see themselves outside the context of spiritual , intellectual and physical brutality ? <p> Our first contact with the assembled group participating in the project seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these teens . Because their verbal skills were very limited , they were uncomfortable about articulating their deeper thoughts . Their aspirations for the future typically went no further than high school graduation , and they had difficulty imagining possibilities for themselves outside the realm of the known . <p> Their opinions of themselves in general were very low : some even demonstrated such childlike behavior as thumbsucking and hiding behind others . They were universally fatalistic about conditions in their communities and the world . Their physical health was poor and their attention spans were short . <p> However , these teen mothers did manifest some very positive characteristics . They had remarkably tenacious spirits and a determination to survive their difficult circumstances in spite of the formidable odds arrayed against them . It was also readily apparent that they had vivid imaginations , although they did not realize that that had value . And of course , their love and concern for their children was unwavering . <p> In the first few days of the two-week period of intensive performance/workshops , Living Stage 's strategy was to present these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their own experience of life for solutions . It was felt that doing this would make their first experience of the company one that validated  --  not attacked or criticized  --  them . We used one of our most dramatically effective techniques : The acting company performed a short scene about a character in crisis , after which the audience was asked to suggest endings . <p> In the first performance , the group was presented with a familiar situation : A teenager is mistreated by a racist storekeeper and must decide whether or not to seek revenge for the affront to her dignity . The scene endings that the girls invented for this vignette showed their understanding of the problem that was highlighted and served to engage the group in the process of developing the story . The teens eagerly joined in acting out the endings , and were clearly enthusiastic about going further into the process . The hook was set and now the real work of learning to think creatively in all situations could begin . Constructive Self-Expression <p> Subsequently , these young were engaged in dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced to expressing their bodies in human sculptures , through painting and other visual arts media , and through photography . Whatever the form being explored , the young women received consistent , sincere , positive feedback that helped them become more comfortable with expressing themselves . <p> Accompanying these exercises , where any level of participation was accepted , was increasingly sophisticated scene and imagination work . For example , hypothetical situations were set up in which the participants became characters other than themselves and had to solve problems without resorting to violence . The majority of these scenarios necessitated resolving various family crises . The same girls who had experienced difficulty expressing their personal opinions now became eloquent role players . <p> One such scene featured two branches of an extended family . One group lived on family-owned land , while the other lived miles away in a city . The drug-related death of a young man in the city required that the family gather together in the country for a funeral . The workshop participants and the company portrayed clan members who had to overcome personal differences as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . <p> As they dealt with the details of these fictitious situations , the teens allowed their characters to undergo transformations in their emotional lives . This was the beginning of a profound learning experience , for young people with a limited knowledge of life generally view the world as composed of immutable forces over which they have no control . They do not understand or believe that people can change , and that they can have an impact upon their own destinies . <p> In many other imaginary environments , the same lesson was reinforced with no lectures or preaching . Gradually , the girls ' unconscious perceptions of the world were affected , allowing them to see that they could have the same power in their real lives . <p> This is one of the primary objectives of Living Stage  --  to show young people that they can create the world of their dreams . However , this world can not stand without a broader context . Since a people 's concept of the world is significantly shaped by an understanding of the past , these young women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heritage . Celebration and Ritual <p> A great deal of time was given to African drumming , dance and ritual . Fortuitous timing had the 2-week workshop coincide with the December holiday season , which gave us the opportunity to incorporate the celebration of the African-American holiday , Kwanzaa , into our time together , Introducing the seven principles of Kwanzaa into our activities provided the occasion to discuss traditional values in various African cultures and to share a rite that belongs wholly to African Americans . <p> Vocabulary and ceremonies that accompany the study of the seven principles of Kwanzaa were included in daily work . One of our most successful scenes took place in an African village , giving the participants an opportunity to play out their concepts of what life might have been like for their ancestors before the invasion of European slavers . <p> In addition to focusing on traditional African life , workshop facilitators also led the girls through some learning about recent African-American history . The children of the post-Civil Rights era are often almost completely ignorant of events and conditions that have led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past reinforces a vision of society as unchanging and oblivious to evolving human needs . <p> A videotape from the acclaimed series , " Eyes on the Prize " that recounts the murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till in Mississippi and the subsequent exoneration of his killers , was shown to the group . The girls were shocked  --  not only at the outrageous injustice involved but also that such behavior was so recently operative in America . <p> After the group viewed the videotape , workshop discussions on racism in America assumed a new urgency . The girls created epic-length scenes about the Till case and the realities of American society in the 1950s . Group dialogue stressed important connections between past and present . <p> As trust within the group increased , there was less stigma attached to verbalizing one 's feelings in open discussion . Workshop members found it easier to broach the very sensitive subject of sexuality and relationships between the sexes . It became clear that there were deeply ingrained stereotypes of acceptable male and female roles . These attitudes sometimes mandate degrading behavior in relationships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the attentions of a desirable male . <p> The girls readily admitted that the most desirable males in their communities were drug dealers , and that receiving expensive gifts from them was an expression of affection that provided a sufficient reason for initiating a sexual relationship . Relative ignorance of their bodies and of birth control methods makes the girls easily impregnable . Early pregnancy is considered a logical , if not completely desirable , consequence of pursuing the position of girlfriend to a high-profile hustler . <p> However , achieving this status does not confer any prestige . The girls bitterly observed that they were publicly " dogged " by their so-called boyfriends and referred to as " whores " and " bitches " by the fathers of their children . They were aware that the boyfriends had other women and , in some cases , children by these women . Some of the girls also related that on occasion they were physically abused . <p> Workshop leaders felt that in order to make any lasting impression on the lives of these young women , the underlying sexist attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theater company , we could take on the pertinent issues more obliquely , without any hint of censure . Our purpose was to illustrate through our artistic work that many life options are available . The Possibility of Change <p> Workshop scenes focused increasingly on individual characters who had powerful dreams of achieving some life goal but were opposed by forces seemingly out of their control . In the determination of their plot endings , the girls overwhelmingly chose to have the protagonist overcome the obstacles in her path  --  whether these obstacles were racism , parental conflict , lack of an education or boyfriends . <p> The girls developed the story climaxes that enabled their characters to move forward in their lives . In their enactments , they articulated positive choices for alternative futures . <p> Interspersed with the workshop sessions in the theater were excursions to such cultural institutions as local art museums . The purpose of these expeditions was to communicate , in yet another way , that art is devised both for the artist 's self-expression and for inspiring the hearts and imaginations of the viewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in museums were following the same artistic imperative required of Living Stage participants , they began to believe that , " I can do this too . " <p> The mentality that had previously been reluctant to acknowledge the possibility of change now had to admit that a range of possibilities was conceivable . The girls reasoned , " If I can do what these artists have done , then what else that is new to me is possible ? " <p> The gentle onslaught of positive messages about the girls ' own power eventually produced tangible results . Some workshop members described the new perspectives they had developed in their relationships with their children and boyfriends . Some of the girls became less tolerant of shabby treatment . Although not quite ready to terminate destructive relationships , a number of these young women had reached the point of openly questioning and protesting what they felt was debasing and sexist behavior . <p> Most encouraging for Living Stage facilitators was hearing these young mothers explore different ways to interact with their children . Several pointed out how much they would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally as they had . And almost all recounted how they had adapted games , songs and exercises from the Living Stage sessions for use in activities with their children . <p> While Living Stage is not seeking to make professional theatre workers of these young women , it is striving to change their perception of themselves and their choices in relation to the rest of society . These young mothers will then be in a better position to take action that may lead them out of the cycle of despair that claims too many of our children . If they can see themselves in a different light , they will in turn behave differently with their children , enhancing their children 's sense of their own creativity and potential . <p> The strides toward such profound change must be made gingerly and lovingly . When these young people feel cared for , they can freely absorb new concepts  --  or perhaps process old beliefs in new ways . This gentle yet aggressive approach is critical when dealing with young people who have sometimes seen their parents and friends abused or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsibilities sooner than they might choose , these young mothers are learning to reclaim their dignity and take control of their lives with the empowering philosophy and strategies devised by Living Stage . <p> PHOTO : Theater lights <p> PHOTO : Happy and sad masks representing the theater <p> By Jennifer Nelson <p> <p> Jennifer Nelson is former Associate Director of the Living Stage Theatre Company . <p> MORE ABOUT THE LIVING STAGE <p> Throughout the year , Living Stage Theatre Company offers a variety of performances , workshops , training , instructional materials , national and regional tours and events that are accessible to the general public . <p> In addition to meeting in regular sessions with its special needs audiences , Living Stage conducts residency training in cities across the country .
