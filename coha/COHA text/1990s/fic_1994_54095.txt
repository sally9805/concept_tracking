Before he left last Sunday night , Gort must have carried them all out the front door and piled them at the curb for the garbage men . The black marbled copybooks full of nature notes must have gone the same way ; when I broke into the safe on Tuesday it was empty . <p> There was one album that he left behind  --  I never got around to fitting any photographs into it . Every night now , while Susie sleeps in her crib upstairs , I sit in the dark living room with a glass of brandy on the floor beside me and this green padded album in my lap . I listen to the summer night : the bleat of an ambulance ; the splintery crash of bottles being hurled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulsing of the crickets . I turn the empty pages one by one . <p> RED LIPSTICK , 1981 All eyes are on them  --  the couple at the top of the aisle , waiting for the organist to find her sheet music . Cousins should n't marry : the eyes moving speculatively over the bride 's satin-covered stomach hold visions of babies with missing limbs , or too many . The couple stand side by side with their arms linked and their eyes on each other . Her father has declined to give the bride away . No one will give her ; she will give herself . <p> The groom is pale in the formal black cutaway he uses for work ( he 's putting himself through M.I.T. as a free-lance pallbearer ) ; his damp , ginger-ale hair is combed sternly back . He can not stop smiling . The bride wears a yellowed satin gown from another time , the gown in which her favorite aunt married a cruel man she has luckily outlived . The bride , too , is pale , except for the bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find in Walgreen 's , brighter and deeper than blood . <p> The mother of the bride lays a hand on one satin sleeve . The organ sounds its first long interrogatory note . <p> SURROUNDED , 1982 Birds on the roof wake her  --  the click of their feet across the shingles , like her mother 's old treadle sewing machine . There is a heavy , sweet smell . She lifts her head from the damp crook of her arm . There are lilacs everywhere . By her cheek , in the triangle between her belly and her pulled-up legs , along her naked back . She rolls over . A broken-off branch jabs her spine . Sitting up , she wraps her arms around her legs . Her own flesh comforts her , the creamy feel of her breasts against her bare knees . There are lilacs heaped on the tangled army blankets at the foot of the bed , lilacs arranged in a row along each side . The breeze through the open window carries the late afternoon voices of children . <p> He appears in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time  --  and they do n't pay you extra . He did n't mean it , what he said , before . <p> Afterwards she holds him , still in his scratchy black jacket , in her arms . The smell of crushed flowers is all around them , a gobbling sweetness , sweet as laughter . They listen to the noise on the roof . Gort says , " Birds in galoshes " <p> FIRE ! GOODBYE , 1984 The new house faces north , toward the lights of Boston , with relics of previous owners rusting in the yard . In the midnight kitchen  --  she forgot to have the electricity turned on  --  street-lights show cartons piled on the floor beside the new kitten 's bed , on the old mouse-colored linoleum countertops , on the round table . Gort , standing naked at the telephone , chews the skin of his lower lip . <p> She holds up one of the cue cards she 's made for these calls from Albert , Gort 's boss at Woods Hole , who 's taken to phoning late at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She points a flashlight and clicks it on . More in Morning ! Goodbye . <p> Outside , rain is falling , serious and slow , filling the cellar with sooty brown water . She holds up another card . Someone at Door ! Goodbye . Gort shifts the phone to his other ear and leans against a laundry basket filled with dishes . Lightning cracks outside . She can see the movement of his lungs against the thin ribs . His bony shoulders curve forward ; his penis in its shadowed nest of hair trembles lightly . She shines the flashlight on her last card . <p> EGG , 1984 In another room , the baby cries . Shouting , the woman picks up an egg . The baby cries ; the egg strikes the edge of the counter next to the man 's clenched hand , slides down the white painted cabinet , pools on the floor . The yolk is bright yellow . They look at each other , appalled ; then , at the same moment , they start to laugh . <p> The man crouches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully on his palm , as if they could be reassembled later . <p> THE ROSE-COLORED UMBRELLA , 1987 Autumn is late this year . It 's still warm enough for a barbecue , though red dogwood and pin oak and maple leaves have been drifting down all afternoon , and the catalpa in the back corner of the yard is already bare . Gort sits in the wooden porch swing with his three-year-old daughter . He holds the hard little heels of Lil 's bare feet , one in each hand . On the steps his nephew , Daniel , sits turning the pages of the Bird Book , in which they recorded that morning , out of season , a dark-eyed junco . Gort sings , <p> preYou 're my little potatoYou had wrinklesOn the bottom of your feet Under the catalpa Judith piles handfuls of silverware into a blue bowl .

They dose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to walk away , James puts the palm of his hand against the slope of her belly . He says , " Your eyes are a beautiful color in this light " He says , " Blue amber eyes . " Silent , not knowing any reply , she watches chickadees pick over leaves on the grass ; an iridescent black fly lands on a coil of dogshit . Her main feeling is surprise : he must know that she does n't want  --  has never wanted  --  anyone but his brother . But James sleeps with everybody  --  ugly , irresistible James . <p> When she looks back from the porch , James is still standing by the dusty rose umbrella , like the folded wings of a huge moth , with the leaves glittering and falling all around him . Beside her , Gort rests his chin on Lil 's head . <p> preYou 're my little potatoYou comeFrom undergroundALLEY OF THE MOON , 1989 They 've been driving through rainy fog for six hours , seven , over narrow roads that run alongside dim November fields . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birch , fir and pine and spruce  --  their colors muted as if under water . The inside of the car , newly shampooed for this , their last trip to the lake until spring , smells like Juicy Fruit . She feels as if someone had clapped a nose cone over her face and held it there . Her jaw aches from yawning . <p> By the time they get through Dayville , it is dusk . Elbow Lake is still an hour away . The sun , wherever it is , has set ; the sky is as blank as the highway , they run together , broken only by the occasional greasy lights of an oncoming car . <p> " We 'll have to stop . " Gort flexes his fingers on the sky-blue steering wheel . He hates fog : the blankness where the headlights end , having to take on faith what 's beyond . " Visibility 's too bad . " <p> Judith hides her gladness and peers with a concerned forehead through the windshield . Gort loves the lake , the land their shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high wooded bluff where two lakes meet . She hates the lake , or fears it ; maybe both . Not the endless mutter of water , the canvas tent struggling against the tent pegs , the mildew-tasting fish ; it 's something else , something she ca n't name . <p> The blurred sign for the Valley of the Moon Motel  --  one long contorted tube of green light with its first letter extinguished  --  is so large they can see it from the road . They park between bare bushes spiked with red berries . Through an uncurtained window they can see a man behind a counter looking out . He is large  --  not fat , but wide  --  in a faded flannel shirt , with pale skin and hair nearly but not quite white . <p> Gort goes into the tiny office , talks to the wide-chested man , comes out . She cranks the window down and the car fills with the smell of wet bark and kerosene . Gort touches her hair , frizzed up from the fog like Easter-basket grass . " Be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk bordered by a row of identical blue doors . The fog opens to take him in . He disappears . <p> She waits . Five minutes ? Ten ? Underneath the motel 's name a white worm of light says Eat . Rest . She has no watch . On the wall behind the motionless motel keeper the arrow-shaped hands of a clock point permanently at noon . Or midnight . She misses five-year-old Lil , the warm steadying weight of her body . <p> It 's absurd to be afraid . There 's the motel sign 's soupy light , the wide window , the bright anonymous beam of the motel keeper 's eyes . But for the first time and quite without warning , she knows . She understands that all of it exists just here , just now : a narrow band between blankness and blankness , a moment without past or future . <p> BLANK PAGES In one of the bare spots every album has ( always more frequent towards the end ) , Gort buys a small black safe at the Sussex Hotel 's liquidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attic , for his copybooks . The lists Judith has gotten used to finding around the house  --  between the hammock pillows , on the back of the grocery list , under his place mat at the kitchen table  --  include more and more items that do n't belong . Original Sin ( ? ) . Coelacanthus in 1938 . Go to Russia . Small things , and none of it seems real ; and he is more often simply the person he always was . The good lover ; the good father . Lil seems to know how to comfort him . For the time being , Judith decides , it is enough to be watchful . <p> JUST TWO GUYS , 1992 In Lil 's eighth summer , a new baby appears . They call her Susie , a foolish , frilly name , in Lil 's opinion . Her father , who is always sad now , says , " Fishing , Lil " and " Just the two of us " ; and they get in the old blue Dodge and go . Gort wears a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the image of her father , wears one , too . They leave the womenfolk ( there are two now ) behind . <p> At sunset the flogs make a sound like rubber bands . Lil stands on a thick , alligator-skinned limb halfway up a big cedar ; its trunk grows out of the bluff at a slant , almost horizontal over the lake . Farther out , the lake doubles the trees around its edge : pine and hemlock and silver birch . Naked except for her puffy orange water wings , she looks down through the cedar fronds . The shallow water is clear and green with purple-shadowed depths . She holds onto a branch near her head and watches for the flicker of sunfish where the water darkens . <p> A bluejay lands at the end of the limb . Its beak opens . Lil can see the black tongue inside . She looks straight down into the water and spits . It marks the surface with a distant dimple , like a water strider . She laughs ; the bird flies off . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where her father , one shoulder hunched , moves slowly between the green canvas tent and the fire with its thin flag of smoke .

I just need to know where you are . <p> Out . I go out . <p> Gort . Please . <p> Gort . <p> Christ , Jude . Will you leave me alone , for once . For once , would you just not ask me . <p> Are you . Is there . Do you have somebody else ? <p> Oh , for Christ 's sake . <p> If you would just . You 're so quiet all the time  --  <p> Do n't . Do n't . Look , your glasses 'll get all steamed up .

Please . <p> Jude  --  Okay . <p> Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1993 Without his glasses , Gort 's face looks nude ; you can see one eye turn slightly inward . He 's sitting on the bare wood floor in the unfinished half of the attic , next to his rumpled sleeping bag , legs stretched out in front of him . By his feet is an empty white porcelain pot . The skylight above his head holds a dim winter sun , a few maverick snowflakes . His telescopes stand in a corner , pointed at the floor . The lens of the larger one is cracked straight across . <p> She sits on her heels next to the chamber pot holding Lustyka , the cat , in her arms for warmth . Gort starts to speak , falls silent , starts again . He does n't look at her , but at the bare feet protruding from his blue pajamas . <p> Whatever it is , it 's better left unsaid . Her terrible aloneness is all she has left of Lil . She no longer wants to  --  ca n't afford to  --  share it . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all right , " though nothing will ever be right again , and moves over to him . He smells like milk gone bad . She pulls his head down into her lap . Pliable as a rag doll , he lies with his head next to the cat 's rump , his legs and buttocks still sitting . <p> Rumbling softly , Lustyka starts to wash herself . The pink triangle of tongue makes its way slowly along her haunches and into Gort 's thick , pale hair . Judith looks up at the skylight and wishes she were out there , floating free  --  or that he were . For a long time they sit like that , in silence , with snow zigzagging in the cold sun and the cat 's tongue rummaging tenderly through Gort 's hair . <p> The noises of the city have quieted . The stop-and-start sound of the crickets has stopped for good . I close the album , my hands trembling only a little now . A scrapbook : scraps .

Then I lock up and go to bed and lie in the dark listening for the soft thud of plaster falling from the ceiling . <p> He told me once about the ancient tribes who may have crossed over to this continent from Asia on the ice sheet and slowly found their way down the coast .
