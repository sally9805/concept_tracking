Of modern North American cases one of the earliest and most widely reported abductions occurred in the early sixties to a mixed race couple in New Hampshire ... <p>  --  K. Clifford Stanton , Taken : 12 ContemporaryUFO Abduction Narratives Bessie is telling the colonel about the ship now , and Bernie , sitting stiffly on the sectional sofa beside his wife , ca n't look up . He stares at the colonel 's cap , the gold braid on the rim , where it rests on the coffee table next to the latest Saturday Evening Post and the plate of tuna-fish sandwiches Bessie has laid out . <p> " What color were the lights , Mrs. Hull ? " the colonel wants to know , and Bessie says , " Blue . " <p> The colonel makes a checkmark . <p> " Baby blue , " Bessie adds . She looks at Bernie , and he nods quickly . He thought the lights were a cop at first . <p> " Baby blue , " the colonel repeats slowly , his pen scratching along . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg is crisply ironed , and his shoes glint . Bernie wishes he could see what the colonel 's writing . <p> " Is that usual ? " he asks . " Blue lights ? In these cases , I mean ? " <p> " I 'm afraid I could n't say , " the colonel says . <p> " ' Cept I believe aircraft lights are usually red and white . " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> " Then this would n't be an aircraft ? " <p> " That 's what we 're aiming to determine , " the colonel says . " Sir . " His smile reminds Bernie of Richard Widmark . <p> There 's a pause , and then Bessie asks , " Wo n't you have a sandwich , Colonel ? " and the colonel says , " Thank you , ma'am . Do n't mind if I do . " He takes one and lays it on his plate , but does n't take a bite . <p> Bernie thought the lights were a cop at first . They 'd already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could have sworn he 'd been doing less than sixty . The cop had shone his flashlight in Bernie 's face  --  black  --  and then Bessie 's  --  white . <p> " Any trouble here , ma'am ? " <p> " Not at all , officer , " she told him while Bernie gripped the wheel with both hands . <p> It was meant to be a second honeymoon . Not that they 'd had a first , really . They 'd been married for seven years . Bernie had been serving in Korea , a corporal in the signals , when he 'd been caught in the open by a grenade . Bessie was his nurse in Tokyo . He 'd heard some of the white nurses refused to touch the black GIs , but she did n't mind . The first day she gave him a sponge bath , he tried to thank her  --  not sure if he was more embarrassed for her or himself ( he felt an erection pushing at the slit of his pajama pants )  --  but she told him not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be silly . " Like it was nothing . " I 'm just saying I appreciate it , " he said , a little stung . " The nature of the race matter and all . " <p> " The race matter does n't matter to me , " she told him briskly . " And it should n't matter to you . " Later she came back , and he asked her to scratch his back , below the shoulder blade where it itched him fiercely , and she did . <p> Perhaps it was the thought of losing his arm . He was so relieved when she told him they 'd saved it . She 'd been changing the dressing on his hand , unwinding the bandages from each fat finger . He whooped with joy . He asked her to have a drink with him . She said she did n't think so , and his face had fallen , but then she 'd laughed , her teeth as bright as her uniform . " Oh , " she said , turning his hand over to wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . I 'd like that . I thought you meant now . You should n't be drinking now , not with your medication . " And then she wound his hand up again in fresh white bandages . <p> Her tour had finished three weeks later , but she 'd stayed on in Tokyo , and by the time his disabled discharge came through , they were lovers . They ate sushi together , and she wore beautiful multicolored kimonos , and it all seemed perfectly natural . He 'd been in the Army for nine years so he hung on to her now as the next thing in his life , and one night after a fifth of whiskey  --  " Why , Bernie Hull , you 're stinko "  --  he asked her to marry him . " Of course , " she said , and he 'd laughed out loud . " Of course ! " They 'd gone back to New Hampshire , where she had a job in a hospital in Manchester . He 'd found work at the local post office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd made a good life together . Bessie 's parents had been kind to him after some reservations . " They know better than to try and stop me when I want something , " Bessie told him . Her brother called Bernie a hero and a credit to his race at the small reception after their wedding at the town hall . Bernie appreciated it , but it only reminded him that he was the one black man in the room . His own parents were long since dead , and his sister , Bernice , back in Summer Hill , had refused to come when she heard Bernie was marrying a white woman . " What for ? " she wanted to know , and when Bernie said , " For the same reasons anybody gets married , " she told him no , she did n't believe it . <p> Bernie did n't know what to say to that . He could hear her kids , his nephews and nieces , in the background , yelling , and then a baby 's sharp , sudden sobs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had n't talked since . <p> His brother , Roy , had been more sympathetic . " You and me been dreaming about white girls since we were boys . Bernice thinks that 's all wrong , and maybe it is , but a man 's got to follow his dream . ' Sonly natural to want what you ca n't have . " But Roy had n't come , either . <p> He and Bessie did have a good life , though . Decent friends . Enough money . Bessie had even taught him to skate . He liked his job , was proud of the uniform , and Mr. Rhodes , the postmaster , treated him well . The first week , when there 'd been a little trouble over Bernie eating at the local sandwich shop , Mr. Rhodes had stepped across the street and told the owner that none of the postmen would be eating there again if Bernie did n't . And just like that the shop integrated , although Bernie told Bessie he would n't have made anything of it himself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd asked him , and when he shrugged she 'd exclaimed , " You 're too darned dignified for your own good sometimes . " <p> He was the only black man he knew in Manchester , but he followed the news of lunchroom sit-ins and the freedom riders and joined the NAACP , although he was a lifelong Republican , like his father and his grandfather before him . He met more Negroes , but they all seemed a little shy of each other , almost sheepish . " Far as civil rights goes , " one of them pointed out to him , " New Hampshire ai n't exactly where it 's at . " <p> What nagged Bernie was that it was all too good , unreal somehow , more than he deserved . He thought of his brother and sister and all the kids he 'd grown up with . Why had he been the one singled out , plucked up by life and set down here ? It made him a little scared to have something . Bessie said he was just being superstitious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day he 'd wake up , or someone would come along and take it all away . When Bessie 'd miscarried for the first time the spring before , along with the worry for her , he 'd felt an awful relief that finally something terrible had happened . He 'd been so ashamed he had n't known how to comfort her , except to keep trying . But when she miscarried for the second time that summer , he 'd decided they could n't go through it again . They 'd been distant these last few months  --  Bessie insisting she still wanted a child , had always wanted one , Bernie doubtful , thinking , She wants one more now she maybe ca n't have one , wondering if this is how she once wanted him , wondering if he was no longer enough for her  --  which was why the idea of a trip to Niagara felt like such an inspiration . <p> Bessie had laughed and called him a romantic , but took his hand across the dinner table . <p> The colonel wants to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trip them up . " I thought you said it was cigar-shaped , Mrs. Hull ? " <p> " From a distance , " Bessie says impatiently . " Up close , you could see it was a disk . " She looks at Bernie for support . <p> " We had a pair of binoculars along for the trip , " he says . " I thought it might be a star at first . But when I pulled over at a lookout and used the glasses , whatever it was was definitely moving . " The colonel is silent so Bernie hurries on , a little breathless but feeling more is required of him . " A little later it came to me that I 'd left the car running the first time while I leaned on the roof with the binocs . I thought the vibrations from the engine might have been the problem , see , so I pulled over again , stepped away from the car before I put the glasses on it . And it was still moving . " <p> Bernie wants the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't move . The colonel does n't even ask him about the binoculars  --  his service issue 10x42 Weavers . <p> " Spinning , " Bessie says . " Do n't forget it was spinning . That 's what gave it the twinkling effect . " <p> " Right , " Bernie says . " The lights that looked like they were moving across it from a distance were actually fixed to the rim . " He makes a circling motion in the air with his index finger while the colonel stares at him . <p> " Did you write that down ? " Bessie asks , and the colonel blinks and says , " Yes , ma'am . I got it . ' Twinkling was spinning . ' " <p> They had agreed before the colonel arrived that Bessie would do most of the talking . Bernie had n't wanted them to tell anyone about what they had seen right from the start , but Bessie insisted on calling her sister , Marge . Had n't Marge seen a UFO herself in ' 57 ? Bernie shrugged . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to tell someone , and Marge at least would n't make fun of them . But it had n't stopped there . Marge put Bessie on to a high-school science teacher she knew , and he told her they should really notify the Air Force . Now here was the colonel with his clipboard . Bernie had n't wanted to meet him , but Bessie 'd had a conniption fit . <p> " Bernie Hull ! How 's it going to look , " she said , " if I 'm telling this story and my own husband wo n't back me up ? " <p> Bernie told her it would n't make any difference , but what he really thought was that nothing he said would help her , might even make her less believable . " You 're a white woman married to a colored , " he wanted to tell her . He did n't think anyone would believe them , but Bessie was n't having any of that . " Of course they 'll believe us , " she said . " So long as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've no gumption , Bernie , that 's your whole trouble . " It seemed so easy to her , but Bernie 'd had to work hard to be believed most of his life . <p> Now he can see Bessie is getting tired of going over the same story again and again . <p> " I 'm not telling you what it means , " she says . " I 'm just telling you what I saw . We were hoping you could explain it to us . " <p> But the colonel just spreads his hands and says , " Sorry , ma'am . " <p> " You act like we 're lying . " <p> " No , ma'am , " the colonel says quickly . " I assure you . " <p> Bernie knows what 's coming next . Bessie wants to get on to the part inside the ship , the stuff Bernie does n't remember . He 's asked her not to talk about it , but she told him she could n't promise . " What if it 's a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our duty , is n't it ? Think what it could mean for the future of everyone . " So now she explains to the colonel how she only remembered this part later , in her dreams . Bernie feels himself shrink , but the colonel just makes another scratch with his pen , and Bessie starts to tell him about the aliens  --  the short gray men  --  and their tests . <p> " Gray ? " The colonel looks from Bessie to Bernie , Bernie to Bessie . <p> " Gray , " she says , and he writes it down . <p> " And short , " she adds . " But not like dwarfs , like children . " <p> In her dream , Bessie says , she remembers them scraping her skin with a strange metal instrument . " Like a dentist might use , only different . It tickled , " she recalls , without a smile . Then she remembers them pushing a long thin needle into her navel . " That really hurt , " she says , " but when I cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . They seemed sorry . They told me it was a pregnancy test . " <p> The colonel , who has been taking notes with his head down , not looking at them , now glances up quickly . <p> " Oh , of course , I 'm not pregnant , " Bessie says brusquely , and Bernie sits very still . This is what he feared all along , that they would n't be able to keep their private business out of this . <p> " Have you ever heard of anything like it ? " Bessie asks . The colonel tells her he has n't . <p> " You have no memory of this ? " he asks Bernie , who shakes his head slowly . He 's racked his brains , but there 's nothing . Bessie ca n't understand it . " How can you not remember ? " she cried the first time she told him , as if he was the one being unreasonable . <p> " Bessie tells me I was in another room on the ship , drugged or something , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support her now , but also in the back of his mind , he resents her dream , his weakness in it . <p> Bessie presses on . She says she knows how it sounds , but she has proof . " I 'm just getting to the best part , " she says . " The part about Bernie 's teeth . " <p> " Teeth ? " the colonel says , and this time Bernie sees a twitch to his lips that makes him feel cold inside . <p> " That 's right , " Bessie says , and Bernie can tell she 's seething now . The aliens , she explains slowly , as if to a child , were surprised that Bernie 's teeth came out and Bessie 's did n't . " They did n't understand about dentures , " Bessie says . Bernie feels his mouth grow dry . They have argued about this part . He did n't want her to tell it , but Bessie feels it 's the clincher . " How could we make that up ? " she asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " This was after the other tests , " Bessie says . " They were as curious as kids . I 'm jumping ahead a little , but do n't mind me . Anyway , after we were done , the one I think of as the doctor , he left the room , and the grayer one , the leader , he told me they were still finishing up with Bernie . Anyhow , a few seconds later the doctor runs back in . He seems very excited , and he asks me to open my mouth . Well , I do n't quite know why , but I wanted to get this over with , so I obliged , and before you know it he 'd pushed his little fingers in my mouth , and he was pulling on my teeth . Well ! You can imagine my surprise . I slapped his hand away quick as I could . He was pulling quite hard , too , making my head go up and down . ' What do you think you 're doing ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and can you guess what he had ? " <p> The colonel shakes his head slowly . <p> " Why , Bernie 's denture . There it was sitting in his little gray hand . Well , I snatched it back at once . I do n't know what I was thinking . It made me so worried about Bernie , I guess . That and the fact that he 's always losing them or pretending to lose them , anyway . " <p> She pauses , and Bernie thinks he should say something . <p> " They pinch me , " he mumbles . " And they click . I do n't like them so good . " <p> Bessie laughed . " I tell him he looks like such a fool without them , but he does n't care . He has such a fine smile , too . " <p> Bernie looks away past the colonel 's shoulder out the picture window . He does not smile . It 's October , and the first snow is beginning to fall in the White Mountains . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader started in about why my teeth were different from Bernie 's , so I had to explain all about dentures , about how people lose their teeth as they get older or like Bernie here in accidents . I thought it was funny they were so flummoxed by dentures , but you know now that I come to think about it , I do n't remember seeing their teeth . They had these thin little slits for mouths , like I said before , and when they talked it was as if they did n't move their lips . " <p> " Did they speak English ? " the colonel asks . " Or was it more like telepathy ? " <p> " Maybe , " Bessie says . " Like voices in my head , you mean ? That certainly could explain it . " <p> " And their fingers ? " the colonel asks seriously . " Would you say they had suckers on them ? Small pads , maybe ? " <p> Bessie pauses and looks at him hard . " No , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " <p> There is an awkward pause before she goes on more brightly . <p> " Anyway , to cut a long story short , I thought the whole thing about the dentures was funny , and I remember laughing , but it must have been one of those nervous laughs because afterwards when I looked at my hand , where I 'd been gripping them , I 'd been holding them so tight that the teeth had left bruises . " And here , Bessie holds out her hand to the colonel . He leans forward and takes it and turns it to the light . Bernie can just see the crescent of purpling spots in the flesh of her palm . <p> Bessie nudges him . Bernie does n't move for a moment , but then he decides . She 's his wife . He 'll try and help . He holds a handkerchief over his mouth and slips his plate out . He passes it to her , and with her free hand she places it in her palm so that the false teeth lie over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks away in embarrassment . <p> " See , " Bessie says triumphantly . " Now that 's evidence , is n't it ? " <p> " It 's something , ma'am , " the colonel says peering at Bernie 's teeth . " It 's really something . " <p> Bernie has tried his damnedest to remember what Bessie 's talking about . But he ca n't do it . It 's the strangest thing , he thinks , because he recalls the rest of the trip  --  start to finish  --  vividly . <p> They 'd got up at five a.m. , packed the car , and been on the road to Niagara by six . Bernie wanted to get a good start on the day . It was September , peak foliage . " What impossible colors , " Bessie breathed , sliding across the seat to lean against him . " Better than Cinerama , " he told her . He 'd sung a few bars of " Oh What a Lovely Morning , " and made her laugh , and she 'd done her best Dinah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 'd got impatient with him the evening before for simonizing the car , bringing out the gloss in the two-tone paint job . Now , he saw , she was proud . <p> But when they stopped for brunch at a diner in upstate New York , Bernie felt uneasy . The din in the place died when they entered , and the waitress seemed short with them . He ordered coffee and a doughnut , but Bessie had the short stack and took her time over her coffee . When he called for the check , she looked up and asked what his hurry was , and he said they still had a ways to go . Did n't he know she had to let her coffee cool before she could drink it ? " Have a refill or a cigarette , " she said , pushing the pack of Chesterfields across the table , but he told her a little sharply he did n't want either . He felt people watching him . Bessie finished her coffee and went to the bathroom , leaving him alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child crying somewhere behind him , but he did n't turn to look . When she came back , he hurried her out , before she could retie her scarf , leaving a big tip . He had to stop to urinate fifteen minutes later , and she made fun of him for not going earlier . " You 're like a little boy , " she said , and so he told her how he felt in the diner . <p> " Oh , Bernie , " she said . " You were imagining it . " <p> It made him mad that she would n't believe him , would n't take his word for it , but he did n't want to spoil the trip with a fight , and he let her half convince him , because he knew it would make her feel better . He played with the radio , pushing buttons until he found some Harry Belafonte . Bessie just did n't notice things the way he did . He loved her for it , this innocence , cherished it , though he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact ) . That night when he drove to two motels and was told that they were full , he did n't make anything of it , and when she said as they left one parking lot , " You 'd think they 'd turn off their vacancy sign , " he just let it ride . <p> " Must be a lot of lovers in town , " she added and squeezed his thigh . <p> When they finally found a room at a place called The Falls Inn , she pulled him to her , and he started to respond , but when she told him she 'd forgotten her diaphragm , he pulled away . <p> " It 'll be okay , " she told him . " Just this once . " She clung to him for a moment , holding him inside her , before he rolled off . They lay side by side staring at the ceiling as if it were the future . After the second miscarriage Bessie had been warned she might not be able to carry a baby to term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernie told her softly , but she turned away . " You 're afraid . " Curled up with her face to the wall , the knobs of her spine reminded him of knuckles . " I 'm afraid of losing you , " he said , at last . <p> He told her he 'd go out and get prophylactics , but driving around in the car , he could n't . He stopped outside one store and sat for fifteen minutes , waiting for the other cars in the lot to leave , listening to the engine tick as it cooled . He was afraid of losing her , he knew , though the admission , so abject and ineffectual , shamed him . But behind that fear was another  --  a dim , formless dread of his own children and what they might mean for the precarious balance of his marriage  --  that made him shudder . There was one more car in the lot , but before it left a police cruiser pulled in , and Bernie backed out and drove slowly back to the motel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a pet name , " Big , " burying the tight curls of her permanent against his chest . He would stroke her neck and answer in the same slightly plaintive baby talk , " Little " or " Little ' un . " It was how they had comforted themselves when they felt small and puny beside their love for each other , but remembering it now only made him feel hopeless before the childlessness that loomed over them . Bessie was asleep when he got in , or pretending , and he lay down beside her as gently as possible , not touching , but aware of her familiar warmth under the covers . <p> The next day had started better . They 'd gone to the Falls and been overwhelmed by the thundering white wall of water . They bought tickets for the Maid of the Mist . Bernie bounced on the springy gangway and made her scream . They laughed at themselves in the yellow sou'esters and rain hats the crew passed out and then joined the rest of the identically dressed crowd at the bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing out children , like miniature adults , in their slickers and hats , but Bernie could n't hear her over the crash of the Falls . " Incredible , " he yelled , leaning forward . He could taste the spray in his mouth , feel the gusts of air displaced as the water fell . Suddenly , he wanted to hold his wife , but when he turned to Bessie , she was gone . He stumbled from the railing looking for her , but it was impossible to identify her in the crowd of yellow slickers . He felt a moment of panic , like when she 'd left him in the restaurant . He bent down to see under the hats and hoods of those around him , conscious that he was startling them , but not caring . In the end he found her in the cabin , her head in her hands . She told him she 'd thrown up . She did n't like boats much in general , she reminded him , and looking at the Falls had made her dizzy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she told him , and he could see she 'd been crying . He put his arm around her , and they sat like that until the trip was over . The other passengers began to file into the cabin around them , taking off their hats and coats and hanging them on pegs until only Bernie and Bessie were left in theirs . <p> They had planned to go on into Canada that afternoon , the first time they 'd been out of the country since Korea , but instead they turned around , headed back the way they 'd come . It was late afternoon , but Bernie figured they could be home by midnight if he got a clear run and put his foot down . <p> The colonel has a few more questions , and he asks if they 'd mind talking to him separately . Bernie feels himself stiffen , but Bessie says , " Of course . " He can tell she wants to go first , so he gets up and says he 'll take a walk . He 'll be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall and finds his topcoat and hat and calls for Denny , Bessie 's dog . He walks out back first , and from the yard he can see Bessie inside with the colonel . He wonders what she 's saying as the dog strains at the leash . Probably talking more about her dreams . She thinks maybe the little gray men took one of her eggs . She thinks she remembers being shown strange children . They had agreed that she would n't talk about this , but Bernie realizes suddenly he does n't trust her . It makes him shudder to think of her telling these things to a stranger . <p> When he takes Denny around front of the house , he is startled to find a black man in his drive , smoking . The young man drops the cigarette quickly when Denny starts yapping . He is in an Air Force uniform , and Bernie realizes that this must be the colonel 's driver . He feels suddenly shy . He tells him , " You startled me , " and the young airman says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment that seems all there is to say . That " sir . " Bernie lets Denny pull him up the drive , whining . The poor dog has n't been out for hours and as soon as they 're at the end of the drive squats and poops in full view of the house . Bernie holds the lead slack and looks the other way . When they walk back a few minutes later , the airman is in the colonel 's car . The windows are fogged . Bernie knocks on the driver's-side glass . <p> " Would you like a cup of coffee ? " <p> The airman hesitates , but his breath , even in the car , is steaming . <p> " I could bring it out , " Bernie offers , and the young man says , " Thank you . " And it 's the lack of a " sir " that makes Bernie happy . He takes Denny inside and comes back out in a few minutes with two cups of coffee and climbs in the car with the boy . He sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crescents of condensation on the windshield . When Bernie sips his coffee , he realizes he 's left his teeth inside with Bessie , and he 's suddenly self-conscious . He thinks he must look like an old fool , and he wants to be silent , keep his mouth shut , but it 's too late . The airman asks him how he lost them . <p> " A fight , " Bernie says . And he tells a story he 's never told Bessie , how he got waylaid by a couple of crackers when he was just a boy . They wanted to know his mama 's name , but for some reason he refused to say . " I just call her Mama , " he said . " Other folks call her Mrs. Hull . " But the boys wanted to know her first name , " her Chrustian name . " Bernie just kept on saying he did n't know it , and then he tried to push past them and leave , but they shoved him back and lit into him . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says now over his coffee , " but it was very important to me that those fellas not know my mama 's name . Mrs. Hull 's all I 'd say . I knew it , of course , although I never called her by it or even rightly thought of her by it . But I 'd be damned if I 'd tell them , and they beat the tar out of me for keeping that secret . " <p> " Yeah , but I bet those boys got their share , " the airman says , and Bernie smiles and nods . He ca n't be more than eighteen , this driver . They talk about the service . The boy is frustrated to be a driver in the Air Force . He wants to fly . Bernie tells him how he was put in signals corps . " They liked having me fetch and carry the messages . " The boy , Bernie thinks , is a good soldier , and he feels a flush of sudden pride in him . But then the coffee is finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " She does n't see him in the car . " Bernie ! " He feels suddenly embarrassed and gets out of the car quickly . " There you are . It 's your turn . " <p> Bernie ducks his head back into the car to take the empty mugs and sees the airman looking at him strangely . " Eunice , " he offers awkwardly . The young man 's face is blank . " My mother 's name . Eunice Euphonia Hull . In case you was wondering . " He closes the car door with his tail , moves towards the house . Inside , he hands Bessie the two mugs , and she takes them to wash up . <p> Back on the sofa , Bernie sees that his dentures are lying beside the plate of sandwiches , but he feels uncomfortable about putting them back in now . <p> The colonel asks him to describe his experiences , and Bernie repeats the whole story . They 'd been making good time until the cop stopped them around ten-thirty , and even then Bernie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains how they noticed the lights a little after that and about twenty minutes later how they began to sense that the object was following them , how he had sped up , how it had kept pace . Finally , he describes it swooping low over the road in front of them and hovering a hundred yards to their right . He 'd stopped , still thinking it could be a chopper , and got out with the binoculars , leaving Bessie in the still running car . But after getting a closer look he 'd become uneasy , run back , and they had left in a hurry . They could n't have been stopped more than ten minutes , but when they got home it was almost dawn , hours later than they expected . <p> " Mrs. Hull , " the colonel says , " claims you were screaming when you came back to the car . About being captured . " <p> Bernie feels a moment of irritation at Bessie . <p> " I was yelling , " he says . " I was frightened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't tell you why . I just knew this was n't anything I understood . " <p> He pauses , but the colonel seems to be waiting for him to go on . <p> " I was in Korea . I mean , I 've been under fire . I was never afraid like this . " <p> " These dreams of your wife , " the colonel asks . " Can you explain them at all ? " <p> " She believes them , " Bernie says quickly . " Says they 're more vivid than any dreams she remembers . " <p> " Can you think of anything else that might explain them ? " <p> Bernie pauses . He could end it all here , he thinks . He looks at his dentures on the coffee table , feels the flush of humiliation . He opens his mouth , closes it , slowly shakes his head . <p> The colonel waits a moment as if for something more . Then : " Any dreams yourself ? " <p> " No , sir , " Bernie says quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The colonel clicks his pen  --  closed , opened , closed  --  calls Bessie back in , thanks them both for their time . He declines another sandwich , puts his cap under his arm , says he must be going , and they follow him out to where his driver holds the door for him . The car backs out , and they watch its taillights follow the curve of the road for a minute . Bernie wonders if the colonel and his driver will talk . If the colonel will make fun of their story . The thought of the young man laughing at him makes him tired . But then he thinks no , the colonel and the airman wo n't share a word . The boy will just drive , and in the back seat the colonel will watch him . Bernie feels like he let the boy down , and he feels suddenly ashamed . <p> They stand under the porch light until the car is out of sight . " Well , " Bessie says , and he sees she 's glowing , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right thing , do n't you ? " He feels his own mood like a shadow of hers . Moths ping against the bulb , and he flicks the switch off . In the darkness , they 're silent for a moment , and then he hears the squeal of the screen door as she goes inside . <p> It 's not late , but Bessie tells him she 's about done in . The interview has gone on for almost four hours . She goes up to bed , and Bernie picks up in the living room , carries the cups and plates through to the kitchen , fills the sink to soak them . The untouched sandwiches he covers in Saran Wrap and slides into the refrigerator . He drops his dentures in a glass of water , watches it sink . Then he goes up and changes into his pajamas , lays himself down beside his already sleeping wife , listens to her steady breathing , dreams about the future . <p> A few weeks later they 'll receive an official letter thanking them for their cooperation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernie hopes Bessie will let the matter drop there , but she wo n't . She wants answers , and she feels it 's their duty to share these experiences . " What if other people have had them ? " They 'll meet with psychiatrists . They 'll undergo therapy . Bernie shows symptoms of nervous anxiety , the doctors will say , but they wo n't know why . Eventually , almost a year later , under hypnosis , Bernie will recall being inside the ship . He and Bessie will listen to a tape of his flat voice describing his experiences . Tears will form in Bessie 's eyes . <p> " It 's as if I 'm asleep , " he 'll say on the tape . " Or sleepwalking . Like I 'm drugged or under some mind control . " <p> Under hypnosis , Bernie will remember pale figures stopping their car . He 'll recall the ship  --  a blinding wall of light  --  and being led to it , as if on an invisible rope , dragged and stumbling , his hands somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded , the aliens touching him , pinching his arms and legs , peeling his lips back to examine his gritted teeth , cupping and prodding his genitals . It 'll all come back to him  --  running through the woods , the breeze creaking in the branches , tripping and staring up at the snowy trees . " Like great white sails , " he 'll hear himself say thickly as the spool runs out . <p> Afterwards , he 'll tell Bessie in a rage he 's finished with shrinks , but in the months that follow she 'll call more doctors and scientists . She 'll say she wants to write a book . Something extraordinary has happened to them . They 've been chosen for a purpose . She 'll talk to journalists . Bernie will refuse to discuss it further . They 'll fight , go days without speaking . <p> Tonight , in his dream , Bernie wakes with a violent shudder , listens to his heart slow . He 's lying in bed with Bessie , he tells himself . He can feel her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the familiar shifting and settling weight , but then he feels the strange sensation of the mattress stiffening , the springs releasing . He opens his eyes and sees his wife rising above the bed , inch by inexorable inch , in a thin blue light . <p> <p> By Peter Ho Davies <p>
