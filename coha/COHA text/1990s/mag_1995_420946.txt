Not that he has n't ever been heli-skiing . He has , several times . But he has struggled , skiing more with guts than with grace , never quite finding the rhythm , the beauty , and the joy that comes from floating downward through feather-light snow . This time he has fat skis on his feet , and for four days an instructor has been helping him to become a better powder skier . This time he is going to soar . He has brought the articles with him ; they are in his suitcase , in his room in the lodge . Now , finally , after years of powder frustration , he pushes off and begins arcing curves through the virgin snow . His turns are not entirely graceful , but they are not without grace either . He is linking , floating , bobbing , seemingly weightless in a sea of white . I 've come because I want to taste the Holy Grail of skiing  --  a week of bounding like a gazelle through champagne powder by day and sipping fine wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of floating down the slopes of the Canadian Rockies , ever since I was a tyke skiing short icy mogul fields in the Midwest . I have skied deep , untracked powder only a few times before , at resorts , and each time was orgasmic , sensual , and way too short as the lift-served hordes quickly tracked up the new fluff . It was like a taste of the forbidden fruit , snatched away , and I wanted more . Like all journeys to a CMH lodge ( there are eight of them scattered throughout the mountains ) , mine began when I flew into Calgary on a Friday night . Here you stay at the airport hotel , where a CMH representative welcomes you and tags your bags for the lodge to which you are headed . There are several hundred skiers staying in the airport hotel before heading off to the different lodges , and most of them are milling around the lobby , checking bags , meeting up with friends , asking about conditions and weather forecasts ; the excitement is palpable  --  and sometimes humorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case he encounters a huge snow drift next to the piano , I guess . And although it 's easy to make fun of somebody wearing gaiters in a hotel lobby , somehow , they work . Those gaiters are visible symbols of the way I and , I assume , most other people here feel : " Hey We 're going heli-skiing " One indication that CMH is a class organization comes at 7 A.M. the next morning , when a line of luxury motor coaches sits idling in the cold darkness outside the hotel . Even though there are only 43 of us going to the Adamants , and we would easily fit in one bus , CMH has supplied two , so that we have room to stretch out . During the eight-hour ride , Ava , our tour guide , who has a distinctly Austrian accent , goes over snow and weather conditions , avalanche and helicopter safety , choice of skis , food allergies  --  even how to book massages . She gives us forms to fill out on ski rental and skier ability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or regular skis ? " Fat skis are the foot soldiers of the heli-skiing revolution , allowing skiers who could never have attempted deep-snow skiing to experience the joys of virgin mountains untouched by lift tower or bulldozer . ( See page 156 for more on fat skis ) . I 've never used the fat skis before , but I view them with suspicion : To me , one of the greatest joys of powder skiing is the sensation of sinking down , being caressed , enveloped , embraced like a lover by the snow . I do n't want to float on top . Good skiers do n't use these funny , stubby things , do they ? CMH discourses you from bringing your own skis , instead providing skis and poles to all guests free of charge . While they claim to have all types available , Ava is definitely pushing the fat skis . I meet Paul during the bus ride from Calgary to ... well , to where , exactly After eight hours , the bus simply pulls over in a plowed turnaround at a sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fly us and all our gear to the lodge flight to the lodge feels like something out of a movie . Ten of us pile in , and the big jet-powered Bell 212 , cranks up to a deafening whine , the trees and road and bus outside are obscured by a hurricane of snow , and suddenly we 're flying above the treetops and the oxbow bends of the Goldstream River . For five minutes we fly up the narrow valley , huge curtains of mountains rising on both sides . There is not a building in sight until we spy a small speck perched on the lower flanks of a mountain  --  the lodge We are met by a woman with a clipboard and rows and rows of Atomic and Volkl fat skis . I am already in awe of the service : Every other wilderness adventure I 've had has consisted of long arduous treks carrying a large pack , or at least humping my own duffel down the dock . I 'm in the middle of the mountains and I have n't touched my bag since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I open the door . The guests that I did n't meet on the bus , I meet for the first time over cocktails and dinner , and any preconceptions I might have had about my fellow skiers are fast being destroyed . Let 's face it , heli-skiing is a different activity than , say , bass fishing . It takes money and a fair degree of fitness , or so I think . So I had expected to find a lodge full of wealthy , healthy ski jocks . But it soon becomes apparent that these people are not all wealthy doctors , lawyers , and industrialists . And just looking at them , I can tell that they are not all super-fit ski gods . There is nothing wrong with being rich , of course . It 's just that I am not , and when you 're stuck with 43 strangers for a week in the mountains , you wonder if you will have anything in common . Sunday morning comes early , with a big Swiss cowbell ringing in the hall at 7:15 , calling us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8  --  cereal , eggs , ham  --  then outside for a morning safety talk around the helicopter , everybody involved , intense , serious . Then we practice locating buried skiers with the avalanche transceivers . Finally , after two days of planes , buses , and helicopters , we get what we came for . This first day , I am skiing with the group that includes Paul and three Japanese men . They have signed up for a Powder Experience Week , which includes on-mountain instruction every day with the same instructor , and then videotape analysis and a classroom session each evening . Of the 43 clients staying in the Adamant Lodge during this week in early January , 10 are in the instruction group . There is only one helicopter for the four groups ( each group usually consisting of 11 clients and one guide ) , so the groups take turns being shuttled off by The Machine , as the guides call it . The sky is overcast , gray , and a light snow is falling . As we climb through the mountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't matter , because everyone is staring out the windows , awed by the jagged peaks disappearing into the swirling clouds . As we approach our first landing , a small flat area of snow on top of a ridge , months of anticipation have reached a fever pitch . The light is very , very flat , so our first run is an easy warm-up through sparse trees called Easy Over , about 1,500 vertical feet . This is definitely back country skiing . The rolls and dips and drop-offs have not been blasted and bulldozed as at a ski area . In the open areas , the flat light makes it almost impossible to discern the terrain variations ; bumps and drop-offs ambush us with surprising regularity . There are quite a few biffs , and the entire group is covered with snow by the end of the run . Some people are doing a loose parallel , but more than a few are resorting to stem christies , something that would be impossible on regular skis in this deep snow . But the fat skis just float @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roko has the visage of a hawk , with penetrating eyes that appear to see everything , and at six feet six inches , he seems to have a hawk like perch as well . His beard , his hyperkinetic movements , and his hair flying out in all directions from under his headband make him look like a wild man . But Roko is no lunatic . An Austrian mountain guide , former downhiller , and Austrian ski team coach , Roko has been hired to develop something CMH has never had before : a regular instruction program . If fat skis are the foot soldiers of the heli-skiing revolution , then instruction is its radical philosophy , and Roko is its Robes-Pierre . He is in charge of developing CMH 's own unique curriculum of deep-snow skiing , and he is training all CMH guides to be instructors . Several years ago CMH introduced its first level of instruction , the Powder Introduction class . Last year , it began Powder Experience , for those with some powder experience , and this year it will introduce Powder Perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is free ; an instruction week costs no more than a regular week of heli-skiing . Roko came to Canada six years ago and still seems to be learning the language , keeping up a constant patter : " Ve go off slow and den ve ski into dat side , soon ve vill be den in de trees , de terrain is nice and smooth , no real surprises . So ve vill have a nice one here . " He is coaching , coaxing , giving the group positive reinforcement . " Ja , nice , very nice , " he says to all the participants , after they ski a nice little 30-degree , 150-yard stretch of untouched powder . Lunch resembles a giant cocktail party in the middle of a run called Prospector . All we need are tuxedoed waiters with silver trays serving champagne . Instead the helicopter has dropped off containers of sandwiches  --  salami and cheese , egg salad , tuna  --  and chocolate-chip cookies , big bars of Swiss chocolate , huge metal thermoses of hot tea or hot beef bouillon . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All four groups gather at the same spot , and we stand around wolfing down our food , not saying much . After lunch , the Powder Experience group does n't fare much better than it did in the morning , and that night the lodge is quiet , everyone is exhausted , and sleep comes early . Monday dawns under a steely gray , overcast sky , which fades into the color of the mountaintops . It 's hard to tell where the sky ends and the mountains begin ; wisps of cloud cling to the peaks . At breakfast , the croissants are fantastic , melt-in-your-mouth delights ; the lodge has a baker who makes fresh baked goods every day . Already people are opening up , becoming more friendly . I sit at a table where Roko is helping to break the ice . It turns out he is from the part of Austria near Italy in the Dolomites , and he has some good jokes about the 5,000-year-old man that was recently discovered there . " Do you know dey knew he vas a ski instructor because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pockets ? " And : " They knew he vas Austrian , not Italian , because he had tools on him dat verked . " The last barb is directed at Christian , a CMH guide from Italy . We 've all lost our tentativeness today . Where yesterday I had no idea what to expect , today I 'm ready to go . C'm on , let 's go heli-skiing People are milling around , getting their skis , avalanche transceivers , and other gear ready . While the Powder Experience group waits for the helicopter , Roko gives us a quick review of technique , and shows with body movements how to really unweight , how to bend at the waist and knees , sink down , and rise up . " You vill be more sportif , today , ja ? You vil see , the rhythm is here : hup , hup , hup , hup . And ve vill put all the things together , and you vill see you vill be able to make really nice turns , ja ? " The Machine lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the light is flat , but the group is skiing better , following Roko 's advice . We drop into the trees , where the air is absolutely still . Snow is falling gently , but the visibility is still good . Roko leads the way through the trees in his yellow , blue ; and bot-pink suit , yodeling so we know where to find him . Even with fat skis there are a lot of exhausted skiers who elect to fly back to the lodge after lunch , so I join another group . Franz is the guide , and a quiet , commanding presence with a baby face that hides his age ( he has been with CMH for 18 years ) . But Franz is an imp , as well . He wears a perpetual smile and an elf hat . He yells " follow me " and takes off into the trees , the long peaked cap streaming out behind him . This group skis much faster , my speed . There are some very good skiers , and they are all on fat skis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point we are standing in a clearing , and I ask Franz if he always uses fat skis . " Yes , I am on skis every day , and they 're a tool . There is a lot less wear and tear on my body . " Somehow I thought the guides , perhaps the greatest powder skiers on earth , would not be using fat skis . As for me , I 'm getting used to them . You do n't sink into the snow as much , but I still find places in the trees where I hit large pockets of snow that fly up face shots And you still get the same floating sensation that is the raison d'tre of powder skiing . I 'm beginning to think that fat skis are not the skiing equivalent of training wheels , after all . The helicopter lifts us to the top of a run called Bungy . At first it is unclear where to go ; there seems to be nothing but a solid wall of trees . But as usual Franz yells " follow me " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are flying through perfectly spaced Engleman spruce , the trunks flying by like so many slalom poles . The snow is soft and light , and hisses against my pant legs up to my knees . I 'm huffing and puffing , breathing in the pine-scented air . My legs are burning , and I 'm tired and sore , but all that falls away as I find myself soaring in rhythmic turns  --  hup , hup , hup through the trees . Around me , whoops and yahoos and all manner of giddy yelling seem to come from every direction . I am skiing with Brad Nantz , a young insurance agent from San Francisco , and we find ourselves at the top of a steep slope in the trees that is covered with a delicious-looking blanket of untracked snow . We look at each other with expressions that say , " Hey , let 's go quick before everybody else gets here , " and we jump in , bounding through the deep snow , sliding sideways at the end of the turns , smiling , laughing and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs bursting but still with huge grins on our faces . I wonder how another of our companions , Walter , is faring . A 65-year-old , Walter had spinal surgery only 12 weeks ago . One fall the wrong way and things would not be good . Walter 's doctor is not happy about his being here , but Walter has almost a million vertical with CMH . He knows the routine , and he figures he can handle it with fat skis . Back at the lodge there is a small buffet in the bar with tabbouleh and mini pizzas and pasta salad  --  a pick-me-up after a hard day of skiing . Some of us are standing at the bar , drinking Island Lager beer and savoring the food ; others have already high-tailed it to the 10-person hot tub ( the men have discovered that Ute , a blond Austrian guest , takes her hot tub at precisely 5:30 every day ) . " Dis is how you get heli-belly , " Roko says , and we all laugh , and toast to a fine day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that guests can order a bottle of wine to go with the meal . Dinner is served family style at six long tables , a guide presiding at the head of each . Every night is a different meal ; there are no choices , but the food is always plentiful and excellent . Tonight 's entree is trout . One of the people at the bar is Vern Neff , a retired auto body shop owner who 's been coming to CMH for 19 years . We start talking about the changes he 's seen  --  like women . There never used to be women here at all . His wife came once , 18 years ago , and she was the only woman . " Now sometimes you come and half the guests are women , " he says . He has seen other changes , as well . " You would come and there would be plywood bunk beds , with toilets down the hall . That was the sleeping quarters . Another lodge was a Quonset hut where they 'd hand you a mummy bag  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it . " Now there are lodges like the Adamant  --  the newest and the crown jewel of CMH 's lodges . Three stories high , the lodge is more like a small ski  --  area hotel than a lodge , with twin rooms with a bath for all the guests , a TV room with a VCR for showing movies , a full-service ski shop , a drying room , a bar , a dining room , a climbing wall , a game room , and a sauna house , with the hot tub and a view to die for . The lodge is made of fieldstone and fir and maple and pine , with 12-foot ceilings and a big stone fireplace in the middle of the bar . CMH has a few heli-skiing sites where you stay in hotels in towns instead of in a lodge , but Vern prefers the lodge . It 's part of the true CMH experience , he says , and the skiing is really the same at all the areas . Another thing that he says has changed is that they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four times a day . " In the old days they never would have done that ; you were out for the day . Now it 's like a taxi service back to the lodge . " Finally , Vern says he thinks that safety has improved dramatically . " In the old days it used to be the guide would look around , stick his ski pole in the snow , and make a decision to ski or not ski that slope . Now it 's snow pits and automated weather stations . " No discussion of heli-skiing would be complete without mentioning safety . It 's something everyone wonders about . And CMH takes it very seriously . I was amazed by the levels of precaution that most guests never see . Every day one guide is designated the " snow safety guide , " and instead of going out with a group , he digs snow pits , checks the snow survey sites , and generally determines the stability of the snowpack . All the other guides have notebooks in which they constantly take notes , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once at night , to compare what they have seen  --  avalanches , snow stability , weather . In the morning they talk about where they want to go . Every run is voted on ; if just one guide says no , then a run is off-limits  --  no arguments . They keep big charts on the walls with an annual profile of the snowpack . There is a computer for all the data . Franz runs through a litany of the other changes he 's seen : fat skis , instruction , the level of luxury and service that manifests itself in the addition of such things as fresh bread , massages , and wine cellars . Of course , all these changes do n't come cheap : Another change , according to Franz , is that the first year it cost $400 , now it 's $4,000 . " Vat 's von more zero ? " Roko asks . Tuesday , I join the same group again , but instead of Franz , we have a different guide , Ted . He is big and robust , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and like all the guides , he seems to have a perpetual smile on his face . He calls everybody meister . Ted says , " I 'm a Canadian mountain guide , and I do n't know how to yodel . So I just yabba dabba do so you can find me . " He proceeds to demonstrate loudly , and we all find it pretty hilarious that we 'll be following a skiing Fred Flintstone through the mountains of British Columbia . We do n't often wait for the helicopter , which constantly ferries skiers around the mountains in a kind of tag-team relay system that ensures that three groups are always skiing while one is being flown to the next run . By 2:30 in the afternoon , we are taking an exhausting run through wet snow in the lower trees of Panache , and my body is screaming for a break . We reach the bottom of the run and immediately The Machine-I begin to think of it as " The Infernal Machine "  --  lifts us up to the top in about two minutes flat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give for a nice , slow chairlift right about now . " In the middle of the next run , Ted announces that Walter has reached his million-vertical-foot mark . We all cheer , especially when Ted says , " Walter-meister , you can lead the rest of the run through powder untracked even by a guide , " and Walter , characteristically cur mudge only , says " Okay , but ca n't you do something about this flat light , dammit ? " That night at dinner , among much fanfare , Walter is awarded a brand-new , bright red Bogner/CMH **25;1025;TOOLONG one-piece suit , and this time 50 people cheer . Heli-skiing is like that . There are no bars or restaurants to go out to , no phones to talk on , no sporting events to watch on TV , so we are together morning , noon , and night , and many of us have become fast friends . In fact , we all do have something in common with each other , regardless of income or skiing ability , or sex , and that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next day finally dawns bright and clear , with wisps of cloud in the air , which makes for a gorgeous soft light . It is colder today , in the mid 20s  --  should be great snow up high . Franz , standing outside the lodge , yells , " Come on Come on , let 's go " He does n't know how long this weather will last , and does n't want to miss it . The sun hides behind a small cloud , and a aray of light illuminates the ice crystals in the air to form a sun dog . The helicopter lands on a high , razor-sharp ridge , leaving the front and back of The Machine hanging out into space , and we gingerly climb out the door and along the ridge . We 're up high at about 9,400 feet , Christian is our guide , and he points out the Adamants in the distance  --  Mount Sir Sanford , the spires of the Gothics , Marmot Mountain , to Neptune Peak , Poseidon Peak , the Serendipity Spires . Across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the huge crevasses of the glacier . Below us the helicopter is a tiny speck flying back down the valley . The run we are on is called Silk Road , and it rolls away into the valley in absolutely gorgeous white undulating glacial folds . Christian leads us down some steep shots on the ridge 's face , around crevasses on the glacier . With the colder air , the snow is helium-light , and the sun lets us see every little change in the terrain . It is a day to make heroes of all of us . My skiing is light , effortless ; I sink down , rise up , again and again . I feel like every cliche in the book : I am a porpoise , a bird , an otter . But really I am me , feeling at one with nature , skiing with the gravity-induced rhythm of nature , caressed by nature 's beautiful winter child  --  powder . So what if I 've been brought here by The Infernal Machine , so what if I 'm wearing stubby skis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still washes over me . We yo-yo up and down , each group taking a different line down the glacier , which is so vast , you could fit seven or eight Vails in this one valley . It is a single run on CMH 's map . At lunch , I see the Powder Experience group , and ask them how they 're faring . This is the moment that will determine whether the revolution is real , or just a marketing gimmick . Can fat skis and instruction really let these skiers feel what I 've been feeling today ? Their faces are beaming , and they are effusive in their praise  --  for the day , for their skiing , and for Roko , who has taught them all to soar . Paul says , " Lee , you would n't have believed it . This is a day to remember for a lifetime . " And Roko , always the smart aleck , replies , " Ja , this is the kind of day that makes you come back , that makes you waste your money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
