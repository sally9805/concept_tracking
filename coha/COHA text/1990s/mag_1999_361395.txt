While the music industry fiddles , its business is going up in flames . Given how much money is at stake  --  roughly $38 billion in CDs , records and cassettes each year  --  you 'd think that someone would have reached for a hose sooner .

More than 350,000 people downloaded the JukeBox software in 2 1/2 days , the fastest online " uptake " on record . <P> Naturally , I was among the takers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
