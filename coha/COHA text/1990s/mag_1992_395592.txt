Lisa ( her name and others in this article have been changed ) is tall and slender with smooth chestnut skin and wavy hair that cascades down her back . She is beautiful enough to turn men 's heads and smart enough to graduate from college with honors . Now in her early thirties , she looks back on an event that happened ten years ago that still puzzles and excites her . At the all-women 's college she attended , she exclusively dated men , but as she became more involved in feminist activities on campus and made friends with several lesbians , her attraction to the women surfaced , But it was n't until Lisa graduated and broke up with her longtime boyfriend that her attraction to a college friend turned into a sexual encounter . " The day she arrived to visit me , I knew that if I allowed myself to , I could easily let my otherwise platonic admiration of her intelligence and beauty turn into a sexual affair , " Lisa recalls . " We spent the day together catching up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar sipping drinks and playing with each other 's hair . " With both of us feeling relaxed and uninhibited , we decided to go back to my apartment . We barely made it inside before I had my pants off and shirt up and we were making love . I felt so free and passionate that night . It opened a new dimension of my personal discovery . " However , Lisa remembers how confused and claustrophobic she felt after that week . " My friend wanted to enter into a relationship , but I was only interested in our mutual erotic attraction . I knew then and know now that I 'm not a lesbian . " Though Lisa has been happily married for six years , she does not deny that she is still sexually attracted to women . Sexual feelings and encounters between women may be more common than you think . Like Lisa , many women are sexually attracted to other women but do n't consider themselves lesbians . But they are n't exclusively straight , either . Because they ca n't be categorized as either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast gray area in between : bisexual . " Bisexuality shakes up the rigid assumptions that people have about sexuality , that there is only heterosexuality and homosexuality when , in fact , sexual behavior is fluid , " says Lani Kaahumanu , coeditor of Bi Any Other Name : Bisexual People Speak Out ( Alyson Publications , Boston , paperback , $11.95 ) . " The fluidity of bisexuality is scary for most people . " Many straight people find bisexuality as distasteful as homosexuality , while many in the gay and lesbian communities think bisexuals are mixed-up closet cases afraid to really " come out . " Some men are drawn to bisexual women because they consider them a challenge , while many straight women are repelled by them  --  on the one hand afraid that they 'll jump their boyfriends , and on the other afraid that they 'll jump them ! Carol , a 37-year-old Atlantan who moves easily between her male and female lovers , cares little about how others feel . She sums up her feelings about bisexuality simply : " For me it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To understand bisexuality , it 's best to first look at sexual behavior in general . Many experts agree that sexuality is a continuum . That means that exclusive heterosexuality is at one end of the spectrum , exclusive homosexuality is at the other , and bisexuality describes all behavior in between . But because our society demands that you choose one of two labels  --  either gay or straight  --  and celebrates heterosexuality while punishing homosexuality , most women of course say they are exclusively straight . Another percentage  --  at least 10 percent , according to conservative estimates  --  call themselves lesbians while another 10 percent say they are bisexual . Though this seems cut-and-dried enough , bisexuality remains elusive . Despite what people call themselves , their behavior and feelings often defy the labels . Even experts who study sexuality can not agree on a definition of bisexuality . For example , William Wedin , Ph.D. , a Manhattan psychologist and director of the Bisexual Information and Counseling Services , believes that bisexuality is " the capacity to be aroused by either gender through fantasy or physical contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ULCA professor of psychiatry who has published research on African-American women and sexuality , argues that " the individual must define for herself what her sexual preference is and under what context she has reached that conclusion . Someone can not identify her sexual orientation for her based solely on behavior . " Wyatt notes examples of women who have had one sexual experience with a woman or a prolonged relationship that provided comfort and sexual release . Yet these women , like Lisa , consider themselves to be straight and not bisexual . In another case , Darlene , a 29-year-old graduate student in Austin , Texas , defines herself as a lesbian , but recently had a brief sexual relationship with a man . To keep from losing her identity as a lesbian , she kept this heterosexual affair " in the closet . " To untangle the complex web of sexual labels , Shere Hite , researcher on sexuality and author of The Hite Report , suggests that behavior rather than people should be described as hetero- , homo- , or bisexual . Given the social stigma attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight regardless of their sexual behavior . Though no one knows exactly what " causes " or determines sexual orientation , Wedin believes sexual behavior is greatly influenced by a blend of individual experiences and cultural values . The reasons a woman makes sexual choices , especially to move from thinking about entering into an affair with another woman , are as varied as the individuals . FROM CURIOSITY TO CRUSH Curiosity , Wyatt believes , greatly influences a woman 's openness to the idea of a homosexual encounter . However , before she can entertain the idea , she has to believe it 's an option . Gwendolyn Goldsby Grant , Ed.D. , a New Jersey psychologist , certified sex counselor and ESSENCE columnist , agrees that a woman 's access to information on sexual exploration contributes to her attitude . " Sex between women is gaining exposure in the African-American community because women are exchanging ideas that raise their consciousness about sexual options , " she says . Valerie , a 40-year-old New York City librarian , is considering such an option . Lately , she says , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friends ( who are also 40-something single , professional women ) has changed . " We used to talk about the men in our lives , but now the conversation drifts to our curiosity about having sex with women , " says Valerie . " No one will admit they 're seriously considering having a sexual affair with another woman . Actually , though , one of my friends hit on me , but I 'm not ready . I suspect some of my friends have already tried it but wo n't confess . " Considering the much-cited statistics on the lack of eligible Black men for sisters over 40 , Valerie and her friends may simply be adapting to a social reality . Valerie admits that she 's sick of the dating scene . Grant acknowledges that many Black women are emotionally exhausted from looking for a " good " man and tired of having to struggle with men romantically and sexually . " There are women , " Grant explains , " that form intimate relations with each other in lieu of men . They hug and kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that alone fills a romantic need that would normally be satisfied by men . " As Grant describes it , Leslie has turned to a woman to get her romantic needs met . She is a 26-year-old divorced writer living in Philadelphia who has been hurt by men and is sick of their " doggish " behavior . Her response is to continue to have sex with them but to reserve her emotional and intellectual bonds for her women friends . " Most of my friends are lesbians , " says Leslie , " because their identity is n't wrapped up in finding a man or worrying about what men think . I actually do n't feel men are on my level intellectually and spiritually , so I get that from women . " Leslie has also begun to realize that she is drawn to women sexually as well . " I have a strong attraction to one of my close friends , but we have never had a sexual affair . She is one of the most romantic people I know and can give me what I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like she 'll call me after a dinner date and tell me what a great time she had or leave a beautiful poem on my answering machine . " Though They may not have acknowledged it directly , Leslie and her friend are courting or dating , behaving much like a gay couple . They may or may not end up having sex . In other cases , however , one woman will have a strong attraction to another but keep her feelings to herself , to avoid complications . Sharon is one of those women . Married for three years , Sharon , a 30-year-old Boston-based journalist , developed a strong sexual feeling for her yoga instructor . " She was a very impressive woman with a strong presence , " says Sharon , " and I found her body very erotic . I was surprised at the strength of my attraction , especially when I started to fantasize about her , even during sex with my husband . " My feelings started interfering with my marriage , but I 'm too committed to my husband to act on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I do n't have to hide my feelings , nor do I have to act on them . But if I were n't married , I would like to investigate these feelings . " Most experts agree that without the social restrictions and expectations that guide us toward heterosexual relationships , more women might be inclined to experiment sexually with other women . This does not mean that Sharon made a mistake by marrying her husband . But it does raise the issue of how many women may feel isolated and confused because of their sexual curiosity and attractions . TAKING THE LEAP Despite the cultural and social stigma , some women may move from attraction to action . A percentage of these have found that one experience was enough to satisfy their erotic curiosity . Lisa 's sexual involvement , for example , was a matter of timing and interest . " I was at a point in my life where I wanted to explore , " she explains . " That included career , lifestyle and sexuality . I was lucky to know and trust a woman I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Out of that experience , Lisa learned more about her own sexual pleasure and gained an appreciation for qualities that made her feel attractive . Other women , while still thinking of themselves as bisexual , form lesbian relationships . For Alicia , a filmmaker in her mid-twenties living in Manhattan , it was her emotional need to be close to a woman , rather than sexual need , that compelled her to enter into her current relationship . " I was sexually molested at 3 , and my father abandoned me when I was 12 , " she says . " Most men in my life , including some boyfriends , were great disappointments . At a time when I really needed my mother , she was too involved with her boyfriend to be there for me . I felt betrayed by her , yet I still needed her . So I got involved with a woman to get the kind of intimacy I craved . However , if my lover and I broke up , I know I would get involved with men again . " Many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alicia 's relationship with her female lover has helped her resolve childhood pains of sexual abuse and abandonment . As Wedin asserts , " Often women who have been sexually traumatized by men feel that sexual intimacy with women is a safer option . " Other types of crises , including death and divorce , draw women together for comfort , and out of that bond sometimes comes a sexual relationship . For certain women there is no one experience that prompted them into bisexuality . Dejenya , for instance , is a 38-year-old single mother and poet living in the Bay Area . She says her bisexuality has nothing to do with childhood trauma or disappointments in men . She believes she was born bisexual and her earliest childhood memories include attractions to both genders . " All the time I was growing up I had feelings for both girls and boys , " Dejeyna recalls . " In my teens and early twenties I was sexually active with men and women . I was raised in a household that accepted alternatives to the straight lifestyle . Unfortunately the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to cut off those feelings for women until my marriage broke up . Since then I 've decided I 'd rather be with women because the qualities I find in them I ca n't find in men , like companionship and communication . " Regardless of how women choose to define themselves and whether they choose to explore bisexuality , Gwendolyn Goldsby Grant argues that sexual exploration  --  exploring though fantasy or through actual experience  --  is healthy . " The more information a woman has about ways to attain personal pleasure , including sexual pleasure , the more likely she is to incorporate it into her values . She may not choose bi-or homosexuality , " Grant adds , " but the choice will be acceptable . " Whether folks are straight , gay or bisexual , it 's important to follow the stirrings that come from within and to be tolerant of those who love differently . Grant sums up : " Women who love by their own inner truths are willing to discover themselves regardless of society 's condemnation . Because they possess self-knowledge , they lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freelance writer and producer living in Los Angeles . <p>
