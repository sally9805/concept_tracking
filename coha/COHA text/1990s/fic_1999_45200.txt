" People say , Buster , do n't you feel bad with all that weight ? " But I 've never seen a small person beat me at nothing . " - Sports Illustrated , June 1 , 1964 <p> Big Bus STICK IN A FORK AND THE JUICE RUNS OUT . Skin so crisp it shatters , white meat moist , dark slips off the bone in one piece , juice runs down so catch it with a biscuit . Get another biscuit and get gravy too , bumpy with pan scrapings and speckled with black pepper . Eat pie . Chess , shoofly , pecan . Think about what you 're doing . Chew like you mean it . I was born in Sledge , Mississippi . What I remember is being chased and beaten on and what I also remember is deciding to make myself big and harder to hit . I made myself big , but the skinny fast kid was still inside and that meant I could box . Big marshmallow , they 'd say . Chocolate sundae , slobby slab , slabby slob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving his fingers in that poor fellow 's face and my heart , big as all outdoors . Before I was born , before my daddy left and my momma died and those boys chased me home from school each and every day , it was determined that Buster Mathis would fight for the world . I beat Frazier in the trials . Then I busted my hand and missed Tokyo . The way life turns , there 's no explaining why or how . So instead of going Olympic I went back to Grand Rapids to help with the sign business . I still liked following the lines of the letters . The smell and shine of paint made my nose crinkle like it does with blood , mine or someone else 's . Having my body hurt in the ring is something different . With the lights and the noise and everyone watching I feel larger than the pain . I stand aside and watch myself do the work . Jab , skip , paint inside the lines , jab again . Fill the white space with color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then every move needs a separate thought . Block that punch , but it 's already landed on the hard , thin bone between my eyes . It 's flat there when I touch it now . After I hurt my hand and came home I bought a pair of roller skates for thirty-five dollars and went flying along the sidewalks . I was still big and getting bigger and I flew fast without trying . The skates had special ball bearing wheels that held the speed before sending it on to spin faster . Like getting something free . The money I 'd won in little fights made more on its own . I was n't in training anymore and I had extra helpings of pinto beans and ham . Food is dear to me . Cus , my trainer , once ate a loaf of bread while I was doing sit ups on the board . He said I was a fat hog who did n't have what it takes to be a champion . He tore off hunks of bread and rolled them in his hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry but did n't . Then he made me do a hundred more sit ups , bouncing the medicine ball off my belly on the odd counts . I thought of chunks of butter and strawberry jam on thick slices of white bread every time I rose up to see Cus 's face . Food is dear to me . It fills the spaces in . My pictures are down at the gym . No one wants to buy Big Buster pens or t-shirts . " Hey , " the towel boy says , but he keeps walking and , before I can answer , I 'm looking at his back , the basket riding his hip . That 's all I get , never mind anyone else , forget one of the sparring dogs or a spit bucket rat even giving me the look . They all said I was going to put the grand back in Grand Rapids . But there 's Joan and Buster Jr. , he 's fourteen and growing big and his perfect round face does n't show anything of what 's happened that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . Our hands reach for the syrup at the same time and brush together . We watch each other . His hands are mine , but smaller . Hands that can go from soft to hard . " Go ahead , " I say . " Pour it on . " We sit and eat and there 's enough to make us full . After a year or two Cus said it was time for a comeback . He took away my sausages and my corn bread with butter and honey and pulled me down to the gym . " If you lose , " he said , " you 're just batting par . But if you win , that 's something else . If you win , that 's a real upset , man , and a whole new life . " Cus boxed flyweight when he was younger . He looks more worn out than he should . But when he talks about a comeback fight with Ali the tips of his crunchedup ears get pink and his eyes turn sparkly and dark . He wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empty time of sweat , bitter spit , and thin soups . Cus came over to the house with three garbage bags and cleaned out the cupboards and the ice box , did n't say where he was taking our food . He left and came back with new groceries . Divest , he said , and invest . Oranges-Do n't eat the peelscelery , skim milk and fish that Joan cooked up scorched and sad since Cus took away the oil and cornmeal . Divide , Cus said , and conquer . I was asleep by nine every night and did n't move until Cus banged on the door at five for our training run . He chased me on a wobbly girl 's bike and rode up the heels of my shoes if I slowed down . Run , he said , or they 'll leave a piece of you in every corner of the ring . Afterwards was water , two slices of dry toast , and one creamy , dreamy banana , too small in my fist . This went on for three hundred years . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . I wanted to bring him down to earth . The date came too soon . Before I knew it we were on the scales in Houston . Ali called me a healthy specimen and talked about the man who 'd tasted the wine of success and experienced the in-tox-i-ca-tion of life . That was him , I guess . I joked around too , asked if he was gon na let me go eight and he said I was crazy like him . We danced our dance into the spaceship Astrodome . The noise echoed all around the metal saucer and I floated towards the ring , an astronaut with his head in a big glass ball . Then the bell went ding and that ball broke . My body remembered about gravity . My first fight in two years , 256 pounds of nothing hanging on my bones , pulling down , DOWN , no help at all . Head out of water and it 's under again with a snap of color . A mean red beach ball slamming at me , packed tight with bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head light up , crackle and pop . After each of the four knockdowns the crowd 's noise changed to an underwater booming . Even now the beach balls keep coming , but more slowly , lost in the dark , and they say things like : " Why did you lay inside ? " " Why did n't you keep coming forward ? " " Why did n't you give 150% ? " Others have newspaper bits . " Flaccid belly heaving . . . " " Questionable will , thin confidence . . . " " Staggering dumbness . . . " " I was n't going to take the blame for killing him , " Ali said . The papers also told about my crying , my soft nature , how I sold Girl Scout cookies in a bar in Houston . He wants everyone to like him , they say . I want everyone to like me , that 's right . I want to be warm and full of people . Before a fight they say , Be careful , Bus , and it catches at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'll do next . They know I came close to something . I like it until after a while they do n't smile as much and look like they 're trying to figure it out . They 're looking for the missing part , the part that kept me from being the champion and dropped me back in Grand Rapids . Their eyes stop at my middle , where sometimes my old shirt does n't cover all the way . They look disgusted and pleased all at once , as if something has dropped into place . Please pass the pie , I say . I 'm plain Buster , no jokes . I teach Buster Jr . to skate backwards and I go for walks with Joan and it 's sweet and relaxing as it should be , but every time I run into someone on the street they ask why I did n't do this or that , why do n't I try one more comeback fight or this or that or the other , car dealership , restaurant , etc . Franchises . I 'm thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the right moves this time : I come forward ; I 'm an actionizing , terrorizing , pulverizing machine . I remember the fight I won with Frazier and how it felt to have weight and speed and head come rushing together into the most perfect , most beautiful connection on another body . It 's a sweetness I search for my whole life , and find at a different intensity in roller skating , watching Buster Jr. , or driving the Cadillac with Joan . Joan wants to know if I 've found another vocation and I say , vocation ? You mean vacation . Joan 's tall , knows what she knows . My Cleopatra . My Queen of Sheba . Okay , Buster , she says . But the money ai n't going to last forever , not with our grocery bills . Ten chickens , three roasts , ham , a leg of lamb . That 's a week , Buster . Meat costs . I know . I like to eat frankfurters cold off the string-the salty buzz , the casing shrunk so tight it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes I buy Buster Jr . a creamsicle and for me six ice cream sandwiches . Two bites for each sandwich makes twelve bites . Buster Jr . watches and looks disappointed when I 've eaten the last one , but he still has half his creamsicle to go . Still , I wish I 'd saved him a bite to share , and that he 'd talk more , instead of listening to my stories about what-not . The next time he covers his ears against the ice cream music and says he 's too old for fudge pops . I see some of the same worries on Buster Jr . ' s face that I had on mine and I try to tell him how it can all turn out better , or at least differently , than he thinks . Look at me , I want to say . See how much you can mean with your body , how much you can get out into the world and fill it up and make contact and send it all around in a circle . Throwing a left hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the same at different intensities . But I ca n't always tell if this is better or differently . There 's no more fight in me . No one 's chasing now . So the question I see in everyone 's eyes is , What 's he do now ? I 'm like a farting old dog that no one wants to be close to but everyone feels guilty for not petting . Except that my teeth are white and strong and I 'm thirty-seven years old . I think about the future , about the birthdays stretching before me and what can be done to fill the time between all that cake and candles . I get jumpy and I eat . My body is in a small state of action most of the time . It takes a lot to get it started . But then I feel it going on without me , gaining force and momentum as I move down the street . I cover blocks in a step . I 'm a big boulder and nothing grows on me . I 'm a mountain on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor downtown , and comes home tired . With the first paycheck she buys a mattress because I tilt the bed . She sleeps close , but it hurts to look down at the floor and see her there in the morning . We still visit in that way , but it is n't the same . Joan says we have to see each other through , but then she says it 's like running a race . A marathon . I think about Joan leaving and I eat . I go out to the garage and see the bag hanging there like a big dumb ham . I take a tap at it , another , and it squeaks a little , sways . I take a few more and feel the sweat beads popping out and gathering , running into the collar of my shirt . My arms burn . Not even a round of strength in them . I find Buster Jr . in his room , reading Captain Marvel . Posters of super heroes everywhere . Come with me , I say , and he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag , talk in his face . He wants to stay inside himself but I draw him out . Hey sweet boy . Hey milk boy . Hey honey cup . Baby Marvel . That super hero shit ai n't real . He gets excited and angry and he starts to hit . The moment his first connects , a thunderbolt strikes . In a flash my mistakes are undone . The gold is mine in Tokyo . In the fourth with Frazier , I 'm coming forward instead of backing up . Before Houston I 'm a lean 220 , 230 , and I cut Ali off at the knees . That 's how much Buster Jr . changes facts by taking a swing at the bag . His body seems very certain of what it 's doing . It speaks in a way he ca n't . We start training at the gym and Cus comes around , wanting to have a go at him , but for the first time in my life I say no to Cus . This is a new era . Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to boxing , he would say , Because my dad did . Try to unravel your own self and see how far you get . Go back and there are reasons , go back and point to this or to that , go back some more and you 're stuck behind a question mark too big to see around . The same with trying to spin out the future , and so I think it should be for us all , only seeing what 's before us , punching and ducking and getting knocked down and getting up again . And even though I 'm no wise man , I ca n't help but think this is true : The biggest challenge in life is to feel okay about that question mark , to accept it and understand that you can see down the road a short distance but not far enough to prepare . The pull of my body tells me that I 'm here , snug up against the earth , but that can change . Sometimes my bones ache from the weight . Last night Joan spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was trying real hard but she did n't know how much longer she was good for . I lay down next to her mattress . Joan was a little above , she leaned over and held on . Try a little longer , I told her . Things will get better , or different , I said , and fell asleep . When I woke up in the morning she 'd already left for the office . There will always be that question mark with us . I do know something . It 's Saturday , the best day of the week because Joan and Buster Jr . are at home and our neighbors are out mowing lawns , washing cars , yelling at kids , or sitting on the curb . I 'm glab just to know that Joan is wearing the green sun dress I like so much , the one sprinkled with daisies . I think about that dress . I think that I 'm not making another comeback because I 'm not going anywhere . Pretty soon she 'll call Buster Jr . and ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 'll be heavy with deviled ham and potato salad , brownies and a thermos of lemonade . We 'll drive to the river , spread a blanket , and eat lunch . I 'll watch Buster Jr . lie in the shallows , his face and belly raised up to the sun , water running around him . His own solid island . Joan asleep , head in my lap . That 's all . That 's as far as I need to see . That 's as far as I want to see .
