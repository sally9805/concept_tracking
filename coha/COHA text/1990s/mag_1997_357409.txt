Try to imagine this : a mainstream American movie , rife with violent and often murderous behavior , yet so densely plotted , so richly peopled , that you ca n't summarize it in a sentence . Or a paragraph . Or several of them . Imagine , as well , a film set in the exotic past  --  Los Angeles in the noirish ' 50s  --  that tends to make the mass audience skittish . And imagine too a cast of terrific actors that lacks the reassuring presence of a megastar who can , as they say , open a picture . <P> Now try to imagine the pitch meeting for this project . Or the nervous marketing meetings that follow . Better still , imagine yourself at the earliest possible showing of L.A. Confidential , watching alchemist-director Curtis Hanson ( who shares screenwriting credit with Brian Helgeland ) turn pulpmeister James Ellroy 's brutal , bustling novel into something like cinematic gold . <P> To cut to the heart of its intricacy , the film basically follows the misfortunes of three Los Angeles cops as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pioneer of sleazoid celebrity journalism ( Danny DeVito , who brings huge comic relish to the role ) , a shadowy social climber ( David Straithairn ) , who is enamored of underworld glamour , a call girl ( an entrancing Kim Basinger ) working for a service whose employees are obliged to imitate movie stars ( she 's the Veronica Lake look-alike ) , and , eventually , major players in the Los Angeles law-enforcement hierarchy . <P> Whew ! This is Raymond Chandler 's penchant for complex high-low conspiracies writ large . And we have n't even mentioned the police riot , the body decomposing in the basement or the hanging of the D.A . out his office window by his heels in order to elicit information . Nor have we considered the natures of the three lead detectives , who , once they start working in atonal concert , sort of add up to one Philip Marlowe . <P> This trio includes Jack Vincennes ( Kevin Spacey , never more engagingly slippery ) , who is the technical adviser to a Dragnet-like TV show and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Australian actor Russell Crowe ) , who 's a sweet , plodding sort of guy unless someone visits violence on women , which turns him into a raging brute ; and Ed Exley ( Guy Pearce , another Aussie ) , the departmental priss and spoilsport , thoroughly despised by everyone , as moral centers of amoral enterprises should be  --  until they turn out to have been right all along . <P> If you have to spend time in a labyrinth , these are the kind of guys to do it with  --  tough , canny realists who can follow a tangled thread to daylight . Well , hmmm , daylight . There 's not much of that in L.A. Confidential . It 's a movie of shadows and half lights , the best approximation of the old black-and-white noir look anyone has yet managed on color stock . But it 's no idle exercise in style . The film 's look suggests how deep the tradition of police corruption runs . And that , paradoxically , makes it as outrageous ( and outraging ) as tomorrow 's headlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
