A modern retelling of an ancient tale of heroism and horror Photograph <p> IN THE ANGLO-SAXON POEM BEOWULE , Grendel is a monster who terrosizes a tribe called the Seyldings , who are led by King Hrothgar . Grendel lives with mother at the bottom of a pool filled with fire-snakes . Apparently , Grendel comes by his evil genetically , for he is described as being the spawn of Cain , the biblical figure who killed his own brother . In this now-classic novel , John Gardner retells the story from Grendel 's point of view . As our excerpt begins , Grendel has just entered the first year of his 12- year reign of terror against the Scyldings . Thanks to a charm he received from the local dragon , Grendel is nearly invulnerable . Some three or four nights later I launched my first raid I burst in , when they were all asleep , snatched seven from their beds , and slit them open and devoured them on the spot . I felt a strange , unearthly joy . It was as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago of the moonlit world beyond the mere . I was transformed . I was a new focus for the clutter of space I stood in : if the world had once imploded on the tree where I waited , trapped and full of pain , it now blasted outward , away from me , screeching terror . I had become , myself ; the mama I 'd searched the cliffs for once in vain . But that merely hints at what I mean . I had become something , as if born again . I had hung between possibilities before , between the cold truths I knew and the heart-sucking conjuring tricks of the Shaper1 ; now that was passed ; I was Grendel , Ruiner of Meadhalls , Wrecker of Kings ! But also , as never before , I was alone . I do not complain of it ( talking talking , complaining complaining , filling the world I walk with words ) . But I admit it was a jolt . It was a few raids later . The meadhall door burst open at my touch exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hesitated . Men sat up in their beds , snatched their helmets , swords , and shields from the covers beside them , and , shouting brave words that came out like squeals , they threw their legs over the sides to stumble toward me . Someone yelled , " Remember this hour , ye thanes of Hrothgar , the boasts you made as the meadbowl passed ! Remember our good king 's gifts of rings and pay him with all your might for his many kindnesses ! " Damned pompous fools . I hurled a bench at the closest . They all cowered back . I stood waiting , bent torward with my feet apart , flat-footed , till they ended their interminable orations . I was hunched like a wrestler , moving my head from side to side , making sure no sneak slipped up on me . I was afraid of them from habit , and as the four or five drunkest of the thanes came toward me , shaking their weapons and shouting at me , my idiotic fear of them mounted . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one plunged at me , sword above his head in both fists . I let it come . The charm held good . I closed my hand on the blade and snatched it from the drunken thane 's hand and hurled it the length of the hall . It clattered on the fireplace stones and fell to the stone floor , ringing . I seized him and crushed him . Another one came at me , gloating in his blear-eyed heroism , maniacally joyful because he had bragged that he would die for his king and he was doing it . He did it . Another one came , reeling and whooping , trying to make his eyes focus . I laughed . It was outrageous : they came , they fell , howling insanity about brothers , fathers , glorious Hrothgar , and God . But though I laughed , I felt trapped , as hollow as a rotten tree . The meadhall seemed to stretch for miles , out to the edges of time and space , and I saw myself killing them , on and on and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself swelling like bellows on their blood , a meaningless smudge in a universe dead as old wind over bones , abandoned except for the burnt-blood scent of the dragon . All at once I began to smash things-benches , tables , hanging beds-a rage as meaningless and terrible as everything else . Photograph <p> Then-as a crowning absurdity , my salvation that moment-came the man the thanes called Unferth . He stood across the hall from me , youthful , intense , cold sober . He was taller than the others ; he stood out among his fellow thanes like a horse in a herd of cows . His nose was as porous and dark as volcanic rock . His light beard grew in patches . " Stand back , " he said . The drunken little men around me backed away . The hallfloor between us , Unferth and myself , lay open . " Monster , prepare to die ! " he said . I spit bits of bone . He glanced behind him , making sure he knew exactly where the window was . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed somewhat more fiercely . He was one of those . He took a tentative step toward me , then paused , holding his sword out and shaking it . " Tell them in Hell that Unferth , son of Ecglaf sent you , known far and wide in these Scanian lands as a hero among Scyldings " He took a few sidesteps , like one wrestler circling another , except that he was thirty feet away ; the maneuver was ridiculous . " Come , come ; " I said . " Let me tell them I was sent by Sideways-Walker " He frowned , trying to puzzle out my speech . I said it again , louder and slower , and a started look came over him . Even now he did n't know wvhat I was saying , but it was clear to him , I think , that I was speaking words . He got a cunning look , as if getting ready to offer a dealthe look men have when they fight with men instead of poor stupid animals . He was shaken , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For many months , unsightly monster , you 've murdered men as you pleased in Hrothgar 's hall . Unless you can murder me as you 've murdered lesser men , I give you my word those days are done forever ! The king has given me splendid gifts . He will see tonight that his gifts have not gone for nothing ! Prepare to fall , foul thing ! This one red hour makes your reputation or mine ! " I shook my head at him , wickedly smiling . " Reputation ! " I said , pretending to be much impressed . His eyebrows shot up . He 'd understood me ; no doubt of it now . " You can talk ! " he said He acked away a step . I nodded , moving in on him . Near the center of the room there was a trestle table piled high with glossy apples . An evil idea came over me-so evil it made me shiver as I smiled-and I sidled across to the table . " So you 're a hero ; " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice more before I gave up in disgust . I talked on anyway , let him get what he could , come try for reputation when he pleased . " I 'm impressed " I said . " I 've never seen a live hero before . I thought they were only in poetry . Ah , ah , it must be a terrible burden , though , being a hero-glory reaper , harvester of monsters ! Everybody always watching you , weighing you , seeing if you 're still heroic . You know how it is-he he ! Sooner or later that harvest virgin will make her mistake in the haystack . " I laughed . The dragon-scent in the room grew stronger , as if my teasing were bringing the old beast near . I picked up an apple and polished it lightly and quickly on the hair of my arm . I had my head bowed , smiling , looking at him up through my eyebrows . " Dread creature- " he said . I went on polishing the apple , smiling . " And the awful inconvenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always having to find noble language ! It must wear on a man " He looked hurt and slightly indignant . He 'd understood . " Wretched shape- " he said . " But no doubt there are compensations " I said . " The pleasant feeling of vast superiority , the easy success with women  --  " Monster ! " he howled . " And the joy of self-knowledge , that 's a great compensation ! The easy and absolute certainty that whatever the danger , however terrible the odds , you 'll stand firm , behave with the dignity of a hero , yea , even to the grave ! " " No more talk ! " he yelled . His voice broke . He lifted his sword to make a run at me , and I laughed-howled-and threw an apple at him . He dodged , and then his mouth dropped open . I laughed harder , threw another . He dodged again . " Hey ! " he yelled . A forgivable lapse . And now I was raining apples at him and laughing myself weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tried to charge through the barrage , but he could n't make three feet . I slammed one straight into his pockmarked nose , and blood spurted out like joining rivers . It made the floor slippery , and he went down . Clang ! I bent double with laughter . Poor Jangler-Unferth-tried to take advantage of it , charging at me on all fours , snatching at my ankles , but I jumped back and tipped over the table on him , half burying him in apples as red and innocent as smiles . He screamed and thrashed , trying to get at me and at the same time trying to see if the others were watching . He was crying , only a boy , famous hero or not . " Such a life , I said , and mocked a sigh . " Such dignity ! " Then I left him . I got more pleasure from that apple fight than from any other battle in my life . I was sure , going back to my cave ( it was nearly dawn ) , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wrong ; he was a new kind of Scylding . He must have started tracking me that same morning . A driven man , a maniac . He arrived at the cave three nights later . I was asleep . I woke up with a start , not sure what it was that had awakened me . I saw my mother moving slowly and silently past me , blue murder in her eyes . I understood instantly , not with my mind but with something quicker , and I darted around in front to block her way . I pushed her back . There he lay , gasping , his belly like a half-drowned rat . His face and throat and arms were a crosshatch of festering cuts , the leavings of the firesnakes . His hair and beard hung straight down like seaweed . He panted for a long time , then rolled his eyes up , vaguely in my direction . In the darkness he could n't see me , though I could see him . He closed his hand on the sword hilt and jiggled the sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . " Unferth has come ! " he said . I smiled . My mother moved back and forth like a bear behind me , stirred up by the smell . He crawled toward me , the sword noisily scraping on the cave 's rock floor . Then he gave outgain . " It will be sung ; " he whispered , then paused again to get wind . " It will be sung year on year and age on age that Unferth went down through the burning lake- " he paused to pant " - and gave his life in battle with the world-rim monster " He let his cheek fall to the floor and lay panting for a long time , saying nothing . It dawned on me that he was waiting for me to kill him . I did nothing . I sat down and put my elbows on my knees and my chin on my fists and merely watched . He lay with his eyes closed and began to get his breath back . He whispered : " It 's all very well to make a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about dignity and noble language and all the rest , as if heroism were a golden trinket , mere outward show , and hollow . But such is not the case , monster . That is to say- " He paused , seemed to grope ; he 'd lost his train of thought . I said nothing , merely waited , blocking my mother by stretching out an arm when she came near . " Even now you mock me " Unferth whispered . I had an uneasy feeling he was close to tears . If he wept , I was not sure I could control myself His pretensions to uncommon glory were one thing . If for even an instant he pretended to misery like mine . .. " You think me a witless fool , he whispered . " Oh , I heard what you said . I caught your nasty insinuations . " I thought heroes were only in poetry ; you said . Implying that what I 've made of myself is mere fairytale stuff " He raised his head , trying to glare at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , following my mother 's pacing . " Well , it 's not , let me tell you . " His lips trembled and I was certain he would cry , I would have to destroy him from pure disgust , but he held it . He let his head fall again and sucked for air . A little of his voice came back , so that he no longer had to whisper but could bring out his words in a slightly reedy whine . " Poetry 's trash , mere clouds of words , comfort to the hopeless . But this is no cloud , no syllabled phantom that stands here shaking its sword at you " I let the slight exaggeration pass . But Unferth did n't . " Or lies here , he said . " A hero is not afraid to face cruel truth " That reminded him , apparently , of what he 'd meant to say before . " You talk of heroism as noble language , dignity . It 's more than that , as my coming here has proved . No man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled to the hills like a coward . Only you and I and God will know the truth . That 's inner heroism " " Hmm , " I said . It was not unusual , of course , to hear them contradict themselves , but I would have liked it if he 'd stuck to one single version , either that they would know and sing his tragedy or that they would n't . So it would have been in a poem , surely , if Unferth were a character , good or evil , heroic or not . But reality , alas , is essentially shoddy . I let out a sigh . He jerked his head up , shocked . " Does nothing have value in your horrible ruin of a brain ? " I waited . The whole scene was his idea , not mine . I saw the light dawning in his eyes . I understand , " he said . I thought he would laugh at the bottomless stupidity of my cynicism , but while the laugh was still starting at the corners of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You think me deluded . Tricked by my own walking fairytale . You think I came without a hope of winning-came to escape indignity by suicide ! " He did laugh now , not amused : sorrowful and angry . The laugh died quickly . " I did n't know how deep the pool was , " he said . " I had a chance . I knew I had no more than that . It 's all a hero asks for " I sighed . The word " hero " was beginning to grate . He was an idiot . I could crush him like a fly , but I held back . " Go ahead , scoff , " he said , petulant . " Except in the life of a hero , the whole world 's meaningless . The hero sees values beyond what 's possible . That 's the nature of a hero . It kills him , of course , ultimately . But it makes the whole struggle of humanity worthwhile " I nodded in the darkness . " And breaks up the boredom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the effort of it made his shoulders shake . " One of us is going to die tonight . Does that break up the boredom ? " " It 's not true , I said . " A few minutes from now I 'm going to carry you back to Hrothgar , safe and sound . So much for poetry . " I 'll kill myself , " he whispered . He shook violetly now . " Up to you , " I answered reasonably , " but you 'll admit it may seem at least a trifle cowardly to some . " His fists closed and his teeth clenched ; then he relaxed and lay flat . I waited for him to find an answer . Minutes passed . It came to me that he had quit . He had glimpsed a glorious ideal , had struggled toward it and seized it and come to understand it , and was disappointed . One could sympathize . He was asleep . I picked him up gently and carried him home I laid him at the door of Hrothgar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't be misunderstood , and left . He lives on , bitter , feebly challenging my midnight raids from time to time ( three times this summer ) , crazy with shame that he alone is always spared , and furiously jealous of the dead I laugh when I see him . He throws himself at me , or he cunningly sneaks up behind , sometimes in disguise-a goat , a dog , a sickly old woman-and I roll on the floor with laughter . So much for heroism . So much for the harvest-virgin . So much , also , for the alternative visions of blind old poets and dragons . A Closer Look What are Unferths beliefs about heroism ? Does Grendel believe in heroism of any kind ? Why is Unferth surprised that Grendel can talk ? Why is his ability to talk at odds with the Scyldings " image of him ?
