Getting the most out of your pickup during deer season is simple-and the first step is picking up the phone . // DEER HUNTERS ARE AN OPINionated lot . I know ; every year in camp , I get an earful about the " ultimate " truck for deer hunters . Funny thing , though-no matter where I roam , the essential premise boils down to a pair of basic concerns : performance and storage . As one hunter put it , pulling on his red suspenders for emphasis , " There must be a way to get a truck that can crawl through the mud and climb steep trails and carry all my gear into camp-and get my deer back home . " The search for this truck led FIELD &; STREAM to a joint venture that combined the talents of two very different companies : B &M; Racing &; Performance and DeeZee . Initially , we feared that the venture might become the ultimate clash of culturesB &M; is a West Coast high-performance company that cut its teeth on racing ; DeeZee is a Midwest-based manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and building heavy-duty running boards , grille guards , and storage and dog boxes . But , like the fortuitous accident that yielded vulcanized rubber , B &M; and DeeZee bonded instantly . That 's because both understand the particular needs of the hunter . Photograph BODY ARMOR : To protect a 4x4 from the gouges , dents , and scrapes that can occur while driving off oad or through heavy brush , Dee &e; has developed a full line of " body armor . " The UltraBlack grille bar and brush guard help protect headlamps and auxiliary driving lamps . Along both sides are Brite-Tread running boards and side box boards . The inside of the tailgate-which often gets bashed during loading and unloading operations-is similarly protected . // THE PLATFORM FOR OUR PROJECT WAS a 3-year-old Ford F-250 pickup . ( Many deer hunters prefer 3A-ton pickups because of their greater load-carrying capability . ) Previously , the truck had been fitted for serious offroad duty ( see " Locked Tight , " FIELD &; STREAM , April 1997 ) , so it was a natural choice for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine performance , we felt that the special demands of the deer hunter called for a transmission modification-one of B &M's; specialties . Brian Applegate of B &M; told us , " Hunters stress transmissions in several ways . They usually carry huge loads into camp , and they often tow utility trailers . Guys who hunt in the mountains require their trucks to climb steep hills , and these trucks often see rugged offroad duty , including deep mud . All this creates heat-and heat is a certified transmission killer . " Photograph // Hunters who wear suspenders and belts are no-nonsense types who take nothing for granted . The same philosophy guides B &M's; recommendation for a pair of auxiliary coolers . The SuperCooler automatic transmission cooler and the SuperCooler engine oil cooler work together to keep the automatic transmission fluid and the engine oil nice and cool-even while the truck is pushed to the max . B &M's; second recommendation is designed to improve the performance of the automatic transmission . The ShiftPlus electronic shift improver kit electronically recalibrates the transmission 's hydraulic system in order to eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helps reduce heat buildup . The result is better performance and longer transmission life . FROM THERE WE WENT TO THE FOLKS AT DEEZEE . Ron Shivers , DeeZee 's president , said , " There was a time when hunting trucks were hidden behind the house or sequestered in the garage . These trucks bore the scars of lots of offroad miles-the price of getting to out-of-the-way hunting sites . They did the job , but you did n't exactly want to be seen driving around town in ' em . Nowadays , hunters need a hunting truck ' to do double duty-the truck is often the family 's main vehicle as well . In order to that , you need to protect the truck from the scrapes , gouges , and dents that offroad trails inflict . That 's why DeeZee developed running boards , grille guards , and the like . " And truth be told , most hunters-me includedare gear freaks of the first order . Our storage boxes are designed to hold a lot of gear so you can find it when you need it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMpleted , we went to Summit Racing Equipment for three important additional contributions . First , they installed a Flowmaster cat-back exhaust . Improving the flow of exhaust gases helped the engine run more efficiently , which means we were able to put more power to the wheels , where it counts . Second , a Summit remote battery jump terminal ( positive and negative posts ) was mounted to the lower edge of the front bumper . When not needed , plastic caps protect each post . But if you need a jump start , instead of climbing under the hood and connecting directly to the battery , you attach the jumper cables to the remote terminal . This makes jump starting faster and safer . Third , a Summit battery terminal disconnect switch allows you to separate the battery from the electrical system . This helps keep the truck from being hot-wired ; it also means that if you leave the vehicle parked for a long time while in camp or on a day-long stalk , you wo n't have to worry that an accessory ( such as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battery . GIVEN THE WIDE RANGE OF TERRAIN and individual demands of deer hunters , you may want to customize your truck in a different way . Fine . Just keep in mind that the " ultimate " deer hunter 's truck does not require a quest that rivals the search for El Dorado . All you have to do is pick up the phone and order a catalog .

Yet it felt as though she was being punished . <p> " I have rules , " Ron Jones , the political editor , was warning her . " And I expect you to follow them . " <p> Jones , a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in his cramped , glass-walled office on the edge of the newsroom . <p> " Do I have to explain it all over again ? " Sarah asked . She knew she had to keep her composure or miss this opportunity to move onto the national politics staff . She sat as tall as she could in a chair facing Jones . <p> " Of course not , " he told her , softening his tone . " And I 'm not blaming you . Evans should 've known better . He was an editor . " <p> " He was n't really my editor , " Sarah said . It was important that she not be seen as a victim , a nanve young woman seduced by her boss . She did n't want special treatment . <p> " Investigative projects get pretty intense . At least this one did , " she said softly . " Is that why I 'm being moved ? " <p> " Hell , no , " said Jones . " I would n't let the local staff dump anyone on me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those lobbyists in Maryland . <p> " And you were tough but fair with the governor , " he added , " even though she 's a woman . " <p> Sarah hated being constantly reminded that politics was still mostly a man 's game . In Annapolis , the suggestive comments of leering legislators and dismissive slights by some of the veteran reporters had made it clear she would never be one of the boys . In the newsroom , she had faced the widespread assumption that male colleagues had the inside track to the national politics staff . <p> Before she could respond , Jones smiled knowingly , as though sharing an inside joke . <p> " C'm on , look at me , " he told her , spreading wide his huge arms . " Do n't you think people have always seen a big bad black man before thinking anything else ? It 's only made me more aggressive . Sometimes , in this business , it helps to have a chip on your shoulder . " <p> Sarah thought about that for a moment . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it 's a clichT , " Jones said , looking at her intently . " But I see a determined young woman fighting for respect . I also see something of an idealist , but we 'll cure you of that . " <p> Sarah saw herself as a fighter , too , but not necessarily an idealist . Her parents , who had grown up in the sixties and worked as reporters in Washington , had always talked about a sense of mission in journalism after Watergate . But that was before they switched to public relations and lobbying , where the money was . <p> " So why are n't there more women on your staff ? " she asked Jones . <p> " Fair question . I inherited these guys , and nobody ever leaves . So I asked for you the minute I heard they wanted to separate you and your editor friend . " <p> " Former friend , " Sarah shot back . " He dumped me . " <p> " Sounds like you 're still pissed . " <p> " I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake . But I 'm dealing with it . I just have no social life . " <p> " You do n't have to be a nun , " Jones told her . " But there 're no secrets in political reporting . So it 's not a good idea to fraternize on the beat . <p> " Some of my guys are n't happy about you , " Jones added . " They do n't think you 've had enough experience . And a couple of them are close to Evans . They resent your coming over here after what happened to him . " <p> " So you 're really not doing me any favors . " <p> " Listen . I know how badly you wanted this . And you 're getting it a few years early . " Jones leaned back in his chair . " You know , when you think about it , you should be kissing my ass . " <p> They both laughed , and Sarah relaxed enough to make her pitch . <p> " I 'd like to cover money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones smiled at her directness . " And I do n't have anyone on it full-time yet . The Democrats are raising and spending more than ever to take back the White House , and the Republicans are matching them dollar for dollar . I 'm particularly interested in what Trent Tucker will be doing . " <p> Sarah nodded . <p> " You know who Tucker is , do n't you ? " Jones asked . " He 's running Monroe Capehart 's campaign for the Democrats . I think he did some work for Elizabeth Tawney in Maryland . " <p> Sarah froze for a moment . Was he testing her ? <p> " I met him when I was covering Governor Tawney , " she said carefully . " He was a consultant for her campaign . " <p> " Well , he might be a good place for you to start , " Jones said . " He 's a walking conflict of interest . A consultant and a lobbyist . He helps put them into office and then he lobbies them on behalf of his business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run of the White House . " <p> Sarah had known she would n't be able to avoid Tucker if she covered money and politics . But she felt she had prepared herself for it . <p> " I 'll send you to the conventions so you can meet everyone , " Jones said . " You 'll have a few weeks to do some homework before the Democrats go to Chicago . I 'll make sure your new colleagues help you . " <p> " I 'm okay on my own , " Sarah said . " I 've always been pretty independent-you know , the only child of two workaholics . " <p> Jones could already tell she was a loner , the kind of instinctive outsider who , in the news business , often gravitated to investigative reporting . But he wondered who she was trying to convince , him or herself ? <p> Less than five minutes after Sarah left Jones 's office , Mark Daniels strolled in . Jones made a show of looking at his watch . <p> " What took you so long ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over here , are you ? " <p> Mark knew the decision had been made , but he did n't like it . <p> " Why not ? " <p> " She does n't understand politics , " Mark said , casually perching himself on the edge of Jones 's desk . " She 's really an investigative reporter . " <p> " She was investigating politicians . " <p> " That was in Maryland . This is the big leagues . " <p> " C'm on , Mark , " Jones said . " Your real problem is your friend Evans . He gets busted . She gets promoted . And that does n't seem fair to you . Do married guys who fool around have some kind of club ? " <p> " Low blow . " Mark slid off the desk and flopped onto the worn black leather couch on the other side of the office . " I 've never messed around with anyone in the newsroom . Anyway , whatever became of consenting adults ? " <p> " They had to be separated . " Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Evans was one of her supervisors on Metro . He broke the rules , so he gets exiled to a suburban bureau . I asked for Page because she has potential , and I needed more bodies for the campaign . I wanted someone who could do money , which she did in Maryland . " <p> " I heard she thought everybody in the legislature was on the take . " <p> " Some of them were , including a couple of the governor 's allies . Page did Tawney a favor . " <p> " Tom told me he had to rein her in . " <p> Jones leaned forward over his desk . <p> " So , " he said , slowly and emphatically , " Evans was n't just screwing around behind his wife 's back . He was also bad-mouthing his girlfriend behind her back . " <p> " I should n't have said that . " Mark straightened up on the couch . <p> " Damn right , " Jones told him . " Sarah 's part of the team now . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to show her around . " <p> A few days later , on the Fourth of July , Sarah allowed herself to sleep late in the small house she shared in the old Palisades neighborhood , just beyond Georgetown on a bluff above the Potomac River . Her housemate , a lawyer , who was intent on becoming a partner in her firm , had already left to spend the holiday working downtown . Sarah 's task for the day was nearer at hand . <p> The late morning sunlight was filling her upstairs bedroom . She threw on a T-shirt , shorts , running shoes , and a baseball cap that covered her short black hair . Rather than going for a run or to the gym , as she did most mornings , she walked over to MacArthur Boulevard , where she knew the Fourth of July Palisades parade would be starting . <p> It was a distinctly neighborhood affair , with fire trucks from the local engine house and police cars from the Second District sounding their sirens , a big refrigerated truck from Safeway honking its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from local churches and schools . It was traditionally political , with the mayor and members of the city council marching amid supporters who handed out campaign buttons and bumper stickers . It was also eclectic , with representatives of the Oldest Inhabitants association in antique cars , a Bolivian dancing troupe in brightly colored costumes , Scottish bagpipers in plaid kilts , and a gay marching band called D.C. 's Different Drummers . <p> Sarah walked the length of the parade route down to the edge of the Georgetown Reservoir and back toward Palisades Park , studying faces in the crowd through a reporter 's curious eyes . She encountered neighbors , newsroom colleagues who lived nearby , and a lawyer who had once been a source of hers . <p> When she saw the energetic young mayor coming toward her , shaking as many hands as he could , Sarah decided to introduce herself . He was only a few years older than Sarah , and she noticed how fit he looked from his well-publicized running and exercise regimen . His shaved head glistened like polished mahogany in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Page , " the mayor said , taking her by surprise . " We met last year , when I was visiting the governor in Annapolis . I hope you have n't been demoted to covering me . You 're too tough . " <p> Sarah was impressed that he remembered her and flattered by what he said . She was about to tell him about her new assignment when the mayor recognized an older woman pushing toward him . <p> " Mrs. Landry , so good to see you , " he said , reaching out his hand . " Thanks again for that reception in your beautiful home . " <p> I guess I 'm not that important to him , Sarah thought , remembering that it was n't the first time she had taken a politician 's fleeting attention too seriously . She slipped away and continued down the street . <p> Just as she neared Old Chain Bridge Road , a winding lane that tumbled downhill into MacArthur Boulevard , she spotted Trent Tucker . Wearing a loud Hawaiian shirt , with shorts as white as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sunglasses , he was off by himself , sprawled in a lawn chair on the grassy hillside . <p> " Sarah Page , my darlin ' , " Tucker called out before she could reach him . He took off his sunglasses to better assess her tanned , athletic body . " Are n't you still a fine-lookin ' woman . " <p> How could I have forgotten that down-home accent he uses when he turns on the charm ? Sarah thought . She knew that Robert Trent Tucker III , who hated the traditions of old Southern families like his own and never used his full name , liked to manipulate people . <p> " I did n't know you lived around here , " Sarah said , acting surprised . Actually , she had already looked up his address-just up the hill on Old Chain Bridge Road-and had spied on the castle-like stone house from outside its gates . She had also checked on what he paid for the house and the amount of the mortgage , which , according to city land records , was held by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , how 've you been ? ' darlin ' ? " Tucker drawled , easing into the lopsided grin that women found inexplicably captivating . " I know it 's been a long time , but there 's no need to be cold about it . " <p> " Just businesslike , Trent . They 've moved me to the national political staff . " <p> " We 're reunited ? Hallelujah ! " Tucker waved his sunglasses in mock celebration but made no move to get up . Sitting in his lawn chair , his chalky legs splayed in front of him , he was at eye level with Sarah , who was standing just below him on the hillside . <p> " So , " she asked , as though she had n't heard him , " do you live around here now ? " <p> " Sure do , darlin ' , back a ways up the hill and round the bend . " He motioned toward Chain Bridge Road . " What about you ? Are you a neighbor ? Or are you here workin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while ago . " He paused , still grinning . " But then , you just said you were coverin ' national politics now , did n't you ? " <p> " I live on the other side of MacArthur , toward the river , " she said , ignoring the teasing she had once found so amusing . <p> " Sounds nice . Maybe we can take a walk round the ' hood some time . " <p> " You do n't walk , Trent , " Sarah said . " I wonder how you 're going to get back home when the parade 's over . " <p> Tucker laughed . <p> " That 's my car , parked right over there , the big Beemer . I drove down , darlin ' . That hill 's real steep . " <p> " They 've assigned me to campaign finance , " Sarah told Tucker , turning serious to put him on notice . " I 'll be in touch after I get up to speed . And I 'm going to the convention in Chicago . Maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you anytime , darlin ' . " <p> Tucker put his sunglasses on , and Sarah walked back down into the crowd watching the parade . He 's got a bit more paunch , she thought , but otherwise he did n't seem to have changed much . But everything else had . Once , she had been his quarry . Now he would be hers . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
