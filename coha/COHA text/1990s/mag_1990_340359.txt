A scale model of the Statue of Liberty evoked memories of Tiananmen Square . A mock barrier , dubbed the Wall of Colonialism , was battered down as demonstrators cheered . It might have been an anti-Soviet prop at an independence rally in Lithuania . Instead , this was in the city of Ponce in southern Puerto Rico , and the 125,000 yellow-clad marchers were not calling for the island 's freedom but to join the U.S. as the 51st state . <P> The March 10 rally was surprising for its size , spirit and the message emblazoned on some banners : LA ESTADIDAD ES PARA LOS POBRES . Statehood for the poor ? In Puerto Rico 's triangulated politics , the statehood cause had been - monopolized by the upper class . A small faction of nationalists and leftists fought , occasionally with guns , for total independence . The rest of the population appeared content with commonwealth status , the pragmatic option in effect since 1952 . As an American commonwealth , or " associated free state " in island usage , Puerto Rico has received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich by Caribbean standards . But it remains impoverished compared with the mainland , with half the per capita income of Mississippi . <P> Now the triangle has been rearranged . The New Progressive Party , led by former Governor Carlos Romero Barcelo , argues that statehood would mean not only political equality but also more food on the table . The Popular Democratic Party , under incumbent Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon , contends that only an " enhanced " version of commonwealth can protect the island 's economy as well as its Hispanic culture . Judging by polls and street-corner opinion , Romero 's statehood campaign today enjoys momentum . When the Popular Democrats staged a rally in Mayaguez , only 75 partisans showed up . Watching the Ponce parade , Luisa Rodriguez , an unemployed mother of seven , said , " I do n't know if the North Americans want Puerto Rico , but the Puerto Ricans want a better form of life . If there is no statehood , I will move to Ohio . In Ohio , they treat you well . " <P> Washington helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hernandez proposed that Congress give formal blessing to a plebiscite with three options : independence , statehood or a modified form of commonwealth giving the island greater self-government . A month later , George Bush endorsed the proposal and reaffirmed the G.O.P. 's traditional support for statehood . But Bush signaled that he intended more than the token effort made by Republican predecessors . Bush and the Republican National Committee are trying to pry Hispanics from their traditional Democratic loyalty . Proposing full political equality for the island seized from Spain in 1898 helps that effort . <P> The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last summer approved a bill that would sanction a binding plebiscite in 1991 . However , the details horrified the Governor 's faction : under the Senate bill , the statehood option seems an instant gold mine . Islanders would get a congressional delegation plus full parity with the other 50 states in federal welfare assistance immediately , while the present full exemption from federal taxes on individuals and companies would be phased out only gradually . About 40% of the island 's 3.3 million residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hernandez , average monthly benefits for a family of four would climb from $199 to $331.
