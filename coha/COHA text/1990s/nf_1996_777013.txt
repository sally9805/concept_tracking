Dead // I 'm dead . // You want to talk about my family and here I been dead to them for fifty years . Leave me alone . Do n't bother me . They want no parts of me and me I do n't want no parts of them . Hurry up and get this interview over with . I want to watch Dallas . See , my family , if you had a been part of them , you would n't have time for this foolishness , your roots , so to speak . You 'd be better off watching the Three Stooges than to interview them , like to go interview my father , forget it . He 'd have a heart attack if he saw you , He 's dead now anyway , or if not he 's 150 years old . // I was born an Orthodox Jew on April 1 , 1921 . April Fool 's Day , in Poland . I do n't remember the name of the town where I was born , but I do remember my Jewish name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that name when we came to America and changed it to Rachel Deborah Shilsky , and I got rid of that name when I was nineteen and never used it again after I left Virginia for good in 1941 . Rachel Shilsky is dead as far as I 'm concerned , She had to die in order for me , the rest me , to live . // My family mourned me when I married your father . They said kaddish and sat shiva . That 's how Orthodox Jews mourn their dead . They say prayers , turn their mirrors down , sit on boxes for seven days , and cover their heads . It 's a real workout , which is maybe why I 'm not a Jew now . There were too many rules to follow , too many forbiddens and " you can'ts " and " you mustn'ts , " but does anybody say they love you ? Not in my family we did n't . We did n't talk that way . We said things like , " There 's a box in there for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be quiet while I sleep . " // My father 's name was Fishel Shilsky and he was an Orthodox rabbi . He escaped from the Russian army and snuck over the Polish border and married my mother in an arranged marriage . He used to say he was under fire when he ran off from the army , and his ability to slick himself out of anything that was n't good for him stayed with him for as long as I knew him . Tateh , we called him , That means father in Yiddish . He was a fox , especially when it came to money . He was short , dark , hairy , and gruff . He wore a white shirt , black pants , and a tallis on his shirtsleeve , and that was like his uniform , He 'd wear those black pants till they glazed and shined and were ripe enough to stand in the corner by themselves , but God help you if those pants were coming your way in a hurry , because he was nobody to fool with , my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was named Hudis and she was the exact opposite of him , gentle and meek . She was born in 1896 in the town of Dobryzn , Poland , but if you checked there today , nobody would remember her family because any Jews who did n't leave before Hitler got through with Poland were wiped out in the Holocaust . She was pretty about the face . Dark hair , high cheekbones , but she had polio . It paralyzed her left side and left her in overall poor health . Her left band was useless . It was bent at the wrist and held close to her chest , She was nearly blind in her left eye and walked with a severe limp , dragging her left foot behind her . She was a quiet woman , my sweet Mameh , That 's what we called her , Mameh . She 's one person in this world I did n't do right by ....
