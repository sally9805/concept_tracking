<p> MEEKER - Second-generation sheep rancher Nick Theos bounced his gear-grinding 4x4 over rocky , rutted trails to herds watched over by Basque shepherds and border collies . <p> Trailside sheep gave quizzical glances , evergreens in the gold sunlight looked like an impressionist painting and economic problems in the European Union and Pacific Rim seemed far away . <p> They 're not . <p> ' I can remember a time when we had more than 500,000 head of sheep in northwest Colorado alone , ' said Theos , 75 . ' Today , I do n't think there are that many in the whole state . ' <p> Trouble in the Asian economy , rigid quotas in Europe , not to mention the ever-changing tastes of the American consumer , have taken their toll on Colorado 's once vibrant sheep industry . <p> Colorado remains the largest sheep-feeding state in the nation , with sheep brought here from Utah and elsewhere for grazing . But the 440,000 head of lamb and sheep in the state on Jan. 1 , 1999 , was down 23 percent from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked after by Basque herders like the ones who work for Theos and his nephew , Butch Theos . Their herds are on 6,000 acres over a ridge from Nick 's place . <p> Nationwide , the U.S. Agriculture Department shows the number of sheep now being raised in the United States at less than 8 million head - compared with more than 50 million during the 1950s . <p> ' Years ago , there were lots more Colorado sheepmen , ' Theos said . ' Today , we can practically hold our meetings in a phone booth . ' <p> Lamb prices fell 40 percent between 1997 and 1999 - a drop that Peter Orwick , executive director of the Englewood-based American Sheep Industry Association , blames on imports . While Orwick is hopeful that the tide has turned a little , sheep ranchers such as Theos still struggle . <p> Theos described the way today 's realities play out for him . ' It costs me $ 2.50 to shear a sheep , from which you get an average 10 pounds of wool , ' he said . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making $ 1.30 per sheep . Two years ago , we were getting $ 1 per pound for lamb . Last year , it was 85 cents , and this year it 's 75 cents . <p> ' So we 're all making big money at a time when expenses keep going up , from gasoline to interest on loans , ' he said . <p> Many leaving business behind <p> It 's a precarious business that many are leaving - often by selling to developers land that 's been in the family for generations . <p> As the lure of selling out to developers gets harder to resist , the sheep industry - once a key part of Colorado 's economy - faces an uncertain future . <p> In 1998 , there were 1,700 sheep operations in Colorado compared with 2,200 in 1990 . <p> Theos jumped from the truck to unlock the gate to a dirt road leading to land he leases for grazing near a hill called Sleepy Cat . Theos once owned this land - two creeks run through it - and he laments selling those 560 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . I was barely able to pay the bank loan that fall and then had to borrow to pay my income tax . It got to where I had to sell this parcel to a Texan for $ 75 an acre . They 're nice people , but I wish I did n't have to do that . ' <p> Today , rising land values often spell the difference in whether sheepmen - and cattle ranchers and farmers - can stay in business by borrowing against the value of that land . But high land prices also mean young people ca n't go into the business if their families had no land to begin with . <p> Then again , fewer young people find the uncertainties of the ranching life all that attractive . <p> ' At lambing time , you 've got to be out there 17 hours a day , whether it 's sunny or a blizzard , ' Theos said , adding that fewer and fewer young people are willing to do that . <p> Nick 's nephew , Butch , has land about 11 miles north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ' <p> Butch Theos , 48 , has been in the business since he graduated from Colorado State University in 1970 . He represents the third generation of sheep ranchers in this area , but he 's uncertain about the fourth . <p> ' I have three children and one grandson and have encouraged my kids to go to college , maybe look into computers and to branch out . One of my daughters is a teacher . For me , it 's different . This is the life I love . ' <p> Tom Kourlis , the state commissioner of agriculture from 1994-98 during Roy Romer 's administration , is from a family that 's been raising sheep between Meeker and Craig for more than 70 years . <p> Kourlis could have gone in another direction years ago . He chose not to . <p> ' My goal in life was never to walk away with a million dollars from a developer , ' he said . ' And it was n't my father 's goal , either . ' <p> Kourlis recalled that when he was a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father told him an offer was on the table for the ranch . <p> ' The offer was for more than the ranch was worth then , and dad - his name was Harry - said he 'd sell unless I 'd help run the ranch . We had 30 days to decide . It did n't take that long , and I 've never regretted the decision . Because we 're not talking about simply making the most money , but about values - taking care of your family and the land and maybe making things a little better . ' <p> Nick Theos and his wife describe raising sheep as a way of life . <p> ' At our stage in life , we should be selling , ' said Lois Theos . ' But we 're buying . ' <p> A second-generation success story , Theos is nationally known in the sheep industry and served one term in the Colorado Statehouse 20 years ago . When his Greek-born father - also named Nick - began raising sheep here in 1922 after saving money he earned as a coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheepmen . <p> But in today 's global economy , lamb and wool prices in Australia and New Zealand - which are down - have a direct effect here . The effect was big enough for the American sheep industry to seek and get temporary relief for three years from the U.S. International Trade Commission in the form of stiff tariffs on lamb and wool imports from Australia and New Zealand . <p> That European countries have rigid quotas on U.S. lamb or wool also affects the industry here , along with domestic variables ranging from predators and developers to eating and fashion habits to weather cycles . <p> The combined effect of all those forces - foreign and domestic - has n't been good . <p> For Colorado sheep ranchers , lamb prices have stabilized a bit since the new round of tariffs went into effect in July . But the big picture does n't inspire too much optimism . <p> As those raising sheep struggle to make ends meet , larger and larger holdings are moving into the hands of fewer and well-subsidized ' agribusiness ' interests . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' welfare ranching . ' <p> ' Cattlemen and sheepmen are among the first to complain about in-city ' welfare queens , ' but they 're also getting government welfare , ' said Cathy Carlson , grasslands specialist with Boulder chapter of the pro-environment National Wildlife Federation . <p> Carlson particularly objects to allowing sheep to graze on public lands as high as 13,000 feet in fragile alpine areas . ' Nobody has calculated the real cost of this damage to delicate tundra , stripped hillsides and destroyed streamside habitats , ' she said . ' But it 's huge . ' <p> She also objects to federal money being spent on predator control , which she said mainly benefits the sheep industry . <p> And like many other environmentalists , Carlson thinks federal grazing fees are ridiculously low and represent yet another government subsidy . <p> Sheep ranchers naturally disagree . <p> Said Butch Theos , ' Interference from the federal government in this business started in the early 1960s . Each year , it 's gotten a little worse - regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans have the upper @ @ @ @ @ @
