In downtown Nashville , the thermometer climbs toward 100 degrees as the swooning crowd swells to more than 40,000 , all straining to catch a glimpse  --  maybe a word , even an autograph !  --  of one of the celebrities scheduled to appear . A country-music concert at the fabled Ryman Auditorium ? Hardly . They are far too cool in Nashville to get excited about mere music legends . No , this is the opening of a restaurant . <P> Granted , Planet Hollywood is not your average hash house . As the stars step from their limos and navigate the red carpet , the crowds erupt in full frenzy . " I absolutely have to see Bruce Willis ! " shouts Arthur Signoralli , 32 , a mechanic . Marjorie Bates , 61 , and her husband have driven 45 miles from Columbia , Tennessee , to celebrate their 38th wedding anniversary at the big opening  --  outside , not at the party inside . Her long-lens camera at the ready , the excited Bates says , " I want to see everybody ! My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene would be repeated the following week in Seattle , with cyberczar Bill Gates adding his virtual glamour , and soon in the most touristed spots in the U.S. and a score of other countries . And Planet Hollywood is far from the only franchise where it will be happening . Motown Cafe , the Official All Star Cafe , Harley Davidson Cafe , Country Star , Rain Forest Cafe and Dive ! are all out to sate the public hunger for theme dining . These multimedia spectaculars , designed to stimulate every sensory-nerve end  --  possibly even the palate  --  are undergoing a second , rapid phase of growth some 25 years after the first Hard Rock Cafe opened its doors in London with Eric Clapton 's guitar on the wall and American burgers on the menu . <P> In the past couple of years , a business exceeding more than half a billion dollars has emerged that the trade calls " eatertainment . " Theme restaurants , a combination plate of amusement park , diner , souvenir stand and museum , have become the fastest-growing segment of the restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as McDonald 's and the segment known as casual dining , which includes such now ho-hum fern joints as Bennigan 's that serve mere food and drink in a relaxed setting . This heady expansion leads to projections that eatertainment will be a $5 billion baby by the turn of the century  --  assuming the theme dreamers continue to titillate a fickle been-there , done-that public . <P> Wall Street investors too have a craving for concept . Last April Planet Hollywood 's creators , Robert Earl and his principal partner , filmmaker Keith Barish , took the company to the markets via an initial public offering of its stock . With its high-dazzle celebrity partners generating headlines , and with a then dazzling IPO market ( see story page 60 ) generating buyers , the price went into another orbit . Some 11 million shares were offered at $18 each , topped $26 ( you and Arnold Schwarzenegger  --  co-owners ! ) , and held firm in a shaky market . That values the company at almost $2.8 billion  --  91 times its very modest 1995 earnings . Planet Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , boasts a stock-market capitalization second only to McDonald 's . Consider that McDonald 's , which earned $1.4 billion on $9.79 billion in sales last year , sells at 22 times earnings .
