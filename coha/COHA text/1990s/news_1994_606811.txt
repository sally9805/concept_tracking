<p> Shortly after the 1982 midterm elections , Newt Gingrich and his wife , Marianne , took a trip to New York to meet with Richard M. Nixon . Gingrich had gotten a start in national politics supporting Nelson A. Rockefeller in his unsuccessful 1968 presidential campaign against Nixon , but now the disgraced former president was a Republican elder statesman and , like Gingrich , a shrewd analyst of the political scene . <p> House Republicans were regrouping after the devastating midterm loss of 26 seats in the elections , which had wiped out almost all the gains they had made when President Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 . For Gingrich , a 39-year-old congressman who dreamed of building a majority party , the results were not encouraging . <p> " He said that no single person could change an institution the size of the House and that the House Republican Party had to become more interesting , more energetic and more idea-oriented , " Gingrich said of Nixon . " And he said , frankly , all the way back to when he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude about ideas . " <p> Out of the meeting with Nixon was born the Conservative Opportunity Society ( COS ) , a caucus of like-minded young activists that eventually became one instrument for Gingrich 's rise to national prominence and for developing and disseminating the ideas that shape the thinking of the House Republicans Gingrich now will lead . <p> Borrowing not just from Nixon but from other leaders such as George C. Marshall and the late Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley , Gingrich transformed himself over the next decade from a gnat on the sleeve of the congressional leadership  --  as former House speaker Jim Wright once called him  --  to a force to contend with . <p> His clear vision , his remarkable energy , his ability to manipulate the levers of power , his creativity at throwing sand into the Democratic and Republican works , the audacity and often recklessness of his style and rhetoric and his genius at attracting attention  --  much of it negative  --  all contributed to an improbable evolution . <p> What so worried Gingrich in 1982 , and drove him to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing its momentum . " It was clear after the August break in 1981 that the great wave of Reagan reforms was over and that they did not have a second great wave with which they could build the same momentum , " he said in an interview last week . <p> After the meeting , Gingrich returned to Washington and began to assemble the cadre of loyalists who would begin a systematic attack on the House Democrats and shape an agenda for a GOP majority . <p> The strategy , developed during his first term in 1978-1980 and continually refined , was simple . It hinged on eroding public confidence in " the corrupt " Democrats who controlled Congress by focusing on ethics and reform issues while developing a set of Republican ideas that would appeal to a majority of voters . <p> Gingrich said he wanted to develop " a more positive , more open , more optimistic Republican Party , " and over time , he made believers  --  and devoted followers  --  out of the doubters in his own ranks . <p> His opponents have a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( D-Tex. ) , who resigned from the House in 1989 , tarnished by an ethics investigation that Gingrich helped launch . Although hardly an objective observer , Wright 's harsh view of Gingrich is an example of the passions , pro and con , that Gingrich inspires . <p> " At heart , Gingrich is a nihilist , " Wright wrote in a newspaper column last month . " Throughout his career , he has been intent on destroying and demoralizing the existing order . He proudly calls himself a ' systematic revolutionary . ' He has nothing in common with Karl Marx but much in common with Guy Fawkes , who tried to blow up the British Parliament . He is a bit like those who burned the Reichstag in Germany so they could blame it on the ' Communists . ' Torpedoing Congress and blaming the Democrats has been Newt 's route to power . " <p> Harassing the Democrats <p> In the first two years of the Reagan administration , Republicans and conservative " Boll Weevil " Democrats had effectively controlled the House of Representatives . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gingrich feared that his party would revert to the mindset of a permanent minority . <p> Vin Weber , then a Republican representative from Minnesota , remembers when Gingrich approached him about the COS . " He came up to me one day , " Weber said . " We were not very close . He essentially asked me , ' What are you doing next year  --  and for the next 10 ? I sort of laughed and said , ' Nothing special . ' " <p> Gingrich was looking for " back-bencher activists " like Weber . He handpicked most of the early COS members . Joining him were : Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania , Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , Dan Coats of Indiana , Connie Mack of Florida , Dan Lungren of California and Duncan Hunter of California . The group eventually grew to include several dozen representatives . <p> Nixon had suggested monthly meetings ; Gingrich rejected that . " You could n't build a rhythm of activism once a month , " he said , " so we set up as once a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes setting aside whole days to brainstorm or listen to outside speakers such as futurist author Alvin Toffler and " Megatrends " author John Naisbitt . <p> " We believed we had a chance to be a majority and only two things stood in our way , " Weber said . " The first thing was the Democrats . The second thing was the Republicans . " <p> Gingrich , who occasionally stood at an easel in group discussions , stressed that words were crucial weapons . One day was set aside for choosing a name , and each word was imbued with political meaning : " conservative " to emphasize their commitment to an ideology , " opportunity " to describe a Reaganesque optimism , " society " to engender a sense of community outside of government . The label for the enemy : the " liberal , welfare state . " <p> They described themselves as descendents of the Founding Fathers , fighting against encroachments on freedom and excessive taxation . " Wedges " were issues that would split the Democratic Party 's coalition by forcing Democrats to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Magnets " were designed to attract the public to a positive Republican vision for the country . <p> In a Dec. 28 , 1983 , memo to Weber , Gregg outlined nine priority issues for the coming year . They are remarkably similar to the 10 items in the House Republicans ' 1994 " Contract With America " that will shape the first 100 days of the incoming 104th Congress . The issues in the Gregg memo included : line-item veto , balanced budget , crime , drugs , welfare reform , " high frontier " ( Reagan 's " Star Wars " space-based defense system ) , House rules reform and school prayer . <p> Just as the " Contract With America " was tested and refined through polls and focus groups , the original issues the COS adopted were the result of years of Gingrich 's analysis of polls and public opinion . He sought what he called " 65 percent " issues , ones that enjoyed broad support . <p> " Politics is about public opinion and gathering public support , " Gingrich said in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on polls is cynically playing to the voters . " It 's like saying , is n't it pandering for Wal-Mart to stock everything people want to buy . " <p> The COS agenda enjoyed a rich lineage in Republican and conservative politics , echoing Reagan 's early speeches in the 1960s and the early writings of William F. Buckley . In Gingrich 's formulation , powerful ideas move societies , but slowly . " It 's like Russian economist Nikolai D. Kondratieff 's long wave theory of economics , " Gingrich said . " It 's a long wave theory of politics . " <p> A Strong Personality <p> Gingrich has never thought simply of the short term , and he is a student of strong leaders . He calls Peter F. Drucker 's 1969 tome , " The Effective Executive , " which describes how successful leaders spur change , " the best single book on citizenship for the 21st century . " <p> After reading columnist Mike Royko 's book " Boss " about Daley , the late Chicago mayor , Gingrich decided not to chair his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his idea , he never served as chairman . Ultimately , when Gingrich was elected as Republican whip , his ally Walker ran the meetings . <p> " Mayor Daley always had someone else chair the city council because if you 're a very strong personality , you do n't get enough dissent and you do n't get enough open discussion if you 're the chair , " he said . " You need to sit back and listen and take notes and then intervene at key moments ... . I thought it was a very , very shrewd understanding of the self-limitations of being a strong personality . " <p> Gingrich was nothing if not that . He dominated COS and later the House Republican caucus in part by sheer energy . He was inexhaustible . " We 'd finish up one of our meetings at 9:30 at night and I would be ready to go home , " Connie Mack recalled . " At 10 o'clock , Newt was back in his office preparing a memo for the meeting the next morning . " <p> He used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he told the man 's wife he figured that he could influence the official 's thinking for the whole day if he got to him early enough . <p> A prodigious memo writer , he scrawled his thoughts in longhand until he got a laptop computer . <p> His personal life showed the strain of his obsession with politics . His second wife , Marianne , said in 1989 that their marriage had been " off and on for some time . " <p> " You marry to get married , not because you want to ' change the world , ' " she said . " We can do that without being married . " Gingrich , ever calculating , estimated then that the union had a 53 to 47 shot of lasting , correctly , as it turned out . <p> For all the time spent on developing a positive agenda , it was COS 's confrontational tactics with the Democrats that put the organization  --  and Gingrich  --  on the map . The Young Turks quickly developed a series of tactics to hector the Democrats and disrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began televising Congress in 1979 , at the center of their strategy . <p> C-SPAN 's House coverage was still relatively new , and Walker is credited by his peers as the first to recognize its potential for advancing their cause . As the party 's " official objector , " Walker spent hours on the House floor , trying to defend the minority 's parliamentary interests . When he returned to his office , he would find a stack of telephone messages from people around the country . Somebody was watching . <p> Gingrich quickly understood ; he often joked that whenever he went out around the country , people asked him if he knew this guy Bob Walker . " C-SPAN is more real than being there , " he quipped to the Atlanta Constitution in 1985 . <p> On the opening day of the 1984 session , Walker stood up and tried to reserve four hours of time at the end of each legislative day of the year for COS speeches . The request , duly denied , took 45 minutes . <p> COS members began to interrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their issues . " It 's going to be like Chinese water torture , " Gingrich warned . <p> They sopped up time after the end of the regular session each day , the period for " special orders , " when members speak often to an empty chamber on subjects of their choosing . COS also learned to exploit the period at the beginning of the day set aside for one-minute speeches . " We would hold COS meetings at a time in the morning that just preceded the meeting of the House and we would literally walk out of the COS meetings and walk as a group over to the House floor and sit down and do our one-minutes on the theme we had decided for that day , " Walker said . <p> " We have the wrong culture inside the party , " Gingrich lectured in " History and Leadership , " a motivational tape recorded last April that is mailed out to Republican candidates . " If people ask , ' Why is he on TV all the time , ' my answer is ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're out there taking the Democrats on , people say , ' Why are you doing that ? ' The answer is : ' That 's how you attract attention so people can tell who 's you and who 's them . ' " <p> C-SPAN was n't the only medium Gingrich and his allies exploited . The Georgia Republican made an art of seeking media attention . It was a hit-or-miss proposition . A dinner he attended at the National Press Club , he told the Atlantic magazine , " made no sense , except the news media could see me walking through the crowd . " TV news directors were always top priority . He called them " the central nervous system . " <p> In the spring of 1984 , the COS floor tactics drew blood when Gingrich tangled with then-House Speaker Thomas P. " Tip " O'Neill Jr . ( D-Mass . ) . COS members took the floor that May to denounce the Democrats for a " Dear Commandante " letter they had written to Nicaragua 's Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega . Gingrich excoriated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeatist and skeptical view toward the American role in the world " and challenged them to respond . No one did , because he was speaking to an empty chamber . <p> Some days later , a still-infuriated O'Neill took the floor and , shaking his finger at Gingrich , said , " You deliberately stood in the well before an empty House and challenged these people and you challenged their Americanism . It 's the lowest thing I 've ever seen in my 32 years in Congress . " <p> O'Neill was reprimanded for his outburst and his words were excised from the record , a rare instance when a House speaker was silenced . Later he ordered the House cameras to pan the empty chamber when COS members spoke . " We never believed it was an empty chamber , " Weber said . " You were building a cadre out there " among C-SPAN viewers . <p> O'Neill predicted the tactic would boomerang . " I do n't think much of what that group has to say anytime , " he was quoted as saying . " Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American people ... . I think they 're an asset to the Democratic Party . " <p> Fatherly Advice <p> Many House Republicans thought the same thing . The COS hectoring worried senior Republicans in the House , who had been raised in the tradition of comity and camaraderie that transcended party differences . None was more given to this approach than House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois , a genial politician who sparred with O'Neill on the floor and then socialized with him on the golf course . <p> " I have given them some fatherly advice , " Michel was quoted as saying at the time of his rebellious youngsters . " Be gentlemanly and once you 've made your point , get on with the business of governing . " <p> Even some of the original members of COS felt uncomfortable with the group 's tactics . " Newt 's belief that to ultimately succeed you almost had to destroy the system so that you could rebuild it ... was kind of scary stuff for some new people coming in , " Coats recalled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which COS was operating was not compatible with my own personal style , so my involvement diminished . " <p> " Having said that , " he added , " I 'm quick to acknowledge now that we could n't have gotten to where we are today had Newt not kept pushing it as hard as he did . " <p> But the COS activists took refuge behind the protective strength of Reps . Trent Lott of Mississippi , Jack Kemp of New York and Richard B. Cheney of Wyoming , all of whom were more senior and less antagonistic toward the Democrats , but who sympathized with the group 's goals . <p> And they relied on each other . " We just decided that our agenda was more important than our sensitivities as individuals . We helped each other in that regard . We could all kind of go and laugh at the latest story that was being written about one of us that was a negative story , " Walker said . <p> After one clash , O'Neill referred to Gingrich , Weber and Walker as " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into O'Neill on the Capitol subway . According to Walker , O'Neill said with a laugh , " I made you guys . " <p> A Broader Audience <p> While trying to gum up the House machinery , Gingrich and his COS allies continually searched for a bigger audience for their ideas , and for ways to attract more voters to the Republican Party . Gingrich never had just one thing going . At the time he organized COS , he also helped to set up the Congressional Space Caucus and , with then-Sen . Gary Hart ( D-Colo. ) , the Military Reform Caucus . <p> In 1984 , he branched out further . He established a think tank , the tax-exempt American Opportunity Foundation . " A lot of political figures started foundations then , " said Eddie Mahe , the point man on the project . " We were looking for a way to generate some funding to undertake the research and education that all of Newt 's projects tend to need . He is very research-oriented . He just sucks up information . " <p> Bob Weed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up a COS political action committee . The PAC , which later dissolved for lack of funds , and the foundation were precursors of the far-flung network of political and philosophical organizations that Gingrich later used to spread his message . <p> At the same time , Gingrich published a non-fiction book , " Window of Opportunity . " A group of political supporters chipped in $ 105,000 to advertise it , in what Gingrich later called a " naive " attempt to promote it onto the bestseller list . The book reflected Gingrich 's standard themes of the decay of the welfare state and the need for traditional values . It also showed his fascination with technology , space and the future  --  which he predicted with mixed success . <p> Gingrich wrote about space travel as a growth industry , imagining the day when " spending a week 's vacation on a space station or a honeymoon on the moon may become commonplace . " After development of a better space shuttle , he added , " people will flow out to the Hiltons and Marriotts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the planet . " <p> In a chapter on reforming bureaucracies , he wrote , " if we abolished every anti-poverty agency in America and turned the same amount of money over to the poor in individual credit cards , " society would save on overhead and the poor would have more dignity and a better chance to improve their lives . <p> On foreign policy , the former professor predicted , " We must expect the Soviet system to survive in its present brutish form for a very long time . There will be Soviet labor camps and Soviet torture chambers well into our great grandchildren 's lives . " <p> The book was rushed into print in time for the platform hearings that preceded the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas . Mahe , the political consultant advising Gingrich at the time , said the convention marked " the first time we took the whole concept of Newt 's thinking outside of Washington to a broader audience . It was the opening , initial thrust . " <p> For Gingrich and other COS members , the convention was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer and enough other hard-right issues that many Republicans , including the Reagan White House , were uneasy about the final platform document . <p> Sen. Robert J. Dole ( R-Kan. ) , whom Gingrich once dubbed " the tax collector for the welfare state , " scornfully referred to the COS crowd as " the young hypocrites . " <p> " They think they can peddle the idea that they 've taken over the party , " he said , according to a New York Times article one month after the convention . <p> " Well , they are n't the Republican Party and they are n't going to be . " <p> A Stolen Election ? <p> COS claimed another small victory early in 1985 when Reagan , in the first State of the Union address after his 49-state second-term victory , made reference to an " opportunity " society . The Young Turks took this as a sign that they were slowly gaining ground . <p> Then came the disputed election in Indiana 's 8th Congressional District . <p> The Indiana election pitted the incumbent Democrat Frank McCloskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , McCloskey led by 72 votes , but a counting error in one county later gave McIntyre a 34-vote victory , certified by the Indiana secretary of state , a Republican . When the 99th Congress convened on Jan. 3 , 1985 , House Democrats refused to seat McIntyre . <p> The move infuriated Republicans and touched off a lengthy legal process and the creation of a House task force , chaired by Democrat Leon E. Panetta , then a California congressman and now White House chief of staff . The task force was composed of two Democrats and one Republican , Rep. William M. Thomas of California . Eventually , after much rancor , it voted to seat McCloskey . <p> " I believe to this day , and I believe every Republican without exception believes , that Democrats simply , flatly , knowingly stole a congressional seat from a guy who had honestly won it , " Weber recalled . <p> On May 1 , 1985 , McCloskey was allowed to take his seat after a full House vote that went strictly along party lines . Moments later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chamber and down the steps of the Capitol in a symbolic protest , the first walkout in the House since 1890 . <p> Weber believes the episode was crucial to Gingrich 's emergence . " It was essential to Newt and his success to drive home the point that after 40 years or however many it was at that point something corrupting had happened to Democratic rule and that it was not just not in our interest but really wrong to be in bed with the Democrats , " Weber said . " I do n't think Republicans ever looked upon the Democrats the same . " <p> The Wright Target <p> Gingrich gained even more credibility through the historic fight that ended in 1989 with the resignation of Jim Wright as House speaker . <p> Gingrich made a point of attacking House members , Democrats and Republicans , whenever they got into ethical scrapes . But in his decision to take on Wright , whom he reviled as the " least ethical speaker in this century , " Gingrich found himself virtually alone . Even his closest friends warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weber said Gingrich told him , " I 'm not a perfect person . I 've got a lot in my background that is n't pleasant . But there 's nothing like the genuine corruption of Jim Wright ... . None of us are perfect . If that 's going to be the standard , then we 're going to tolerate any level of corruption because no one will ever be able to say it 's wrong . " <p> Gingrich began attacking Wright 's ethics in mid-1987 , using floor speeches , press conferences and interviews with reporters and editorial writers as he traveled the country . That September , The Washington Post provided more ammunition for Gingrich , disclosing that Wright had a sweetheart deal , earning a 55 percent royalty on a book published by a top campaign aide  --  far more than the standard author royalty . <p> " I 'm trying to create a resonance out there , " Gingrich told John M. Barry , who was writing a book , " The Ambition and the Power , " about Wright . <p> In March 1988 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bob Livingston ( R-La. ) and James F. Sensenbrenner Jr . ( R-Wis. ) to review Gingrich 's draft complaint . They concluded it was n't good enough . So Gingrich turned again to the media . " We worked on the assumption that if enough newspapers said there should be an investigation , Common Cause would have to say so . Then members would say it . It would happen , " Gingrich told Barry . <p> As Gingrich predicted , within two months , Common Cause president Fred Wertheimer wrote the ethics committee asking that an outside counsel investigate the book deal and Wright 's help to troubled Texas savings and loan operators . A week later , Gingrich 's complaint , citing the book deal and old oil investments , was filed . <p> Wright could not conceal his disgust with Gingrich . Asked one day how he viewed his antagonist , he replied , " As a fire hydrant toward a dog . " <p> Nonetheless , by the spring of 1989 , Wright 's career was all but over . An ethics committee report that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealings with a Texas friend , and that bulk sales of his book to lobbyists and others skirted a limit on speaking fees . A month later , Wright announced his resignation . <p> Republican activists , conservative and moderate alike , recognized that the toughness Gingrich had exhibited in that fight was the stuff of leadership . He was no longer just part of the pack , no longer just one of the Three Stooges . " Having won that battle , " Walker said , " he emerged as the acknowledged leader of the group . " <p> Staff writers Serge F. Kovaleski and Dale Russakoff and researcher Barbara J. Saffir contributed to this report . <p> NEXT : Final steps to speaker
