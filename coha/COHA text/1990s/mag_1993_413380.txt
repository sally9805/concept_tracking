If you are one of the millions of Americans who would sooner take out your own appendix than join a managed-care medical plan , prepare yourself for a surprise . Supervised health care , the type provided by HMOs and other big medical networks , has provided high-quality care for millions of families during the past 20 years . That fact may fly in the face of stories you have heard about patients getting first-degree hassles and second-class treatment in cost-conscious managed-care networks . But while many of those stories are well documented ( see " The Truth About Managed Care , " MONEY , April ) , they reflect the shortcomings of some networks . On average , the doctors and hospitals working under the managed-care umbrella deserve good marks for their brand of health care , an assessment that is backed up by reams of medical data and scores of patient-satisfaction surveys . Every industry , of course , has its lemons . And as an estimated 75 million Americans are shepherded into medical networks between now and the year 2000  --  thereby joining the 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to separate the quality providers from the rest . The good news is that you can . With a telephone , a pad and pencil , and some smart questions ( which MONEY has compiled ) , it is possible to do a head-to-toe checkup on any plan you may be asked to consider , perhaps by your employer or union . And you 'll probably need to size up more than just one . Roughly half of all employers currently offer two or more managed-care options , including HMOs , preferred-provider organizations and point-of-service plans ( to learn how these varieties differ , turn to page 115 ) . Before you begin grading a network , though , you may need to jettison some widely held misconceptions . Here are the biggest : * Managed-care plans generally do n't provide the state-of-the-art treatment that often spells the difference between life and death . That may be true in some cases , but not in most . Just ask Renee Bietz , 54 , a member of northeast Ohio 's 200,000-patient Kaiser Permanente health maintenance organization . Bietz 's successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last May at the Cleveland Clinic , one of the country 's top cardiac surgery centers and a favorite of the ailing elite , including the Saudi royal family . No potentate , the Brook Park , Ohio grandmother pays just $195 a month for health coverage . Kaiser , however , will be shelling out more than $100,000 for her surgery . * A great number of doctors join managed-care plans because they are too poorly qualified to attract patients on their own . Forget it . On average , network medical staffs are 70 board certified . That means the physicians have completed three to seven years of hospital residency in their specialty and/or passed rigorous written and oral tests administered by highly selective medical specialty boards . Among all doctors in the U.S. today , only 48% are board certified . * Quality often takes a back seat to cost savings in medical networks . " Not true , " says Dr. Alan Hillman , director of the Center of Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania . " Virtually every study that 's looked at the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as or better than treatment by doctors outside managed-care plans . " Still , those studies deal with the averages , and there are managed-care plans that do n't live up to the high standards advocates claim for them . You still want to join only one of the best networks near you , and this story will help you find them . You can begin here . Each year , HealthPlan Management Services , an Atlanta company that advises employers on health coverage , rates 413 HMOs on 29 measures of price and quality . Their 1993 HMO Buyers ' Guide , sold only to employers for a fee of $5,500 , gives 109 top marks for high quality at a reasonable price . Scraping the bottom , however , are 114 plans that rank low in quality and high in price . To preview the top 10 plans of 1993 , see the table opposite . ( Table omitted ) How do you make sure you wind up in a plan that , if not among the 10 best , at least offers top-quality care ? Strictly speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your employer is more dazzled by low price than high quality , the plans you are offered will show it . In most cases , though , workers still have the option of sticking with traditional fee-for-service medical insurance , albeit at higher out-of-pocket cost . Thus , knowing how to evaluate a plan 's quality can help you avoid a costly , even catastrophic , mistake . Start with your employee benefits department . In screening competing care providers , your employer may have gathered all or most of the information you 'll want . Many medium-size and large employers , including Xerox and Southern California Edison , have done just that and will share their findings with employees who bother to ask . If you ca n't get the facts you want from your employer , phone the managed-care plan directly . Be aware that most plans do n't field many tough questions from consumers , so you may get the runaround at first . Persist , however . A first-rate plan will try to give you all the information you seek , even if it means you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan 's medical director . Here are the three areas to focus on : HOW GOOD ARE THE DOCTORS ? To begin evaluating the quality of a plan 's medical staff , get the doctor directory for the p ! an you 're considering and see whether you or anyone you know can spot a physician you trust . Then , call that doctor and ask what he or she thinks of colleagues in the plan . If the impression is favorable , you 'll hear about it instantly . If it is n't , get ready for an indirect response  --  either a filibuster or a series of long pauses that can speak volumes . If you get either , look elsewhere for a health-care provider . You 'll also want to find out the percentage of network doctors who are board certified . You can get that information in the physician directory or from the plan representative . A plan that falls short of the 70% network average for board certification is probably not setting high enough standards . One caveat : There are more than 100 self-styled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements . Be sure the certification a doctor claims reflects membership in one of the 24 boards recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties ( as do the boards counted in the 70% average network certification rate cited above ) . If you have any doubts , you can check the certification status of a physician by calling the ABMS at 800-776-238 . Other valuable bits of information can be gleaned from the forms doctors must fill out to join the plan , which plan sponsors should furnish to consumers without hesitation . Any reluctance to do so may signal that the network is less probing than it ought to be . Besides education and training , the form also should ask for the doctor 's malpractice insurer . Ask whether the application information is verified and how often it 's updated . The best plans check everything and update every two years , though it can cost a plan as much as $200 per investigation . If a plan does n't check or if it does n't bother to update its information , think twice about using it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has obtained a copy of each doctor 's current profile in the National Practitioner Data Bank , a federal file that keeps track of malpractice suits , hospital or licensing sanctions and other disciplinary actions against doctors . One piece of information that is less important than you might think is where a plan 's doctors went to medical school . It is an American bias to believe that U.S.-educated doctors are better trained than those attending foreign schools . To practice in the U.S. , foreign-trained physicians must meet the same licensing standards as American-trained doctors . Finally , ask a plan how many of its applicants are rejected . There 's no right answer . However , zero implies that standards are too low . Among top-quality PPOs , an 8% to 12% rejection rate is average . WILL COST TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER CARE ? While there 's no proof that the cost-consciousness of most medical networks cuts the quality of care , doctors , like most people , may find it difficult to keep money entirely out of their minds when doing their jobs . Observes San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his patients from managed-care plans : " It 's just human nature not to do the work if you 're not going to earn any additional money . " Managed-care plans employ several different payment schemes for doctors , but all place some restraints on their income , and some may even penalize them for ordering up a lot of patient services . Each doctor responds to these influences differently . Thus , while it is impossible to make up-front observations about network quality based on how ( and how much ) it pays doctors , you should make a personal assessment after you join a plan . If the doctors seem unmotivated or uninterested , you can always vote with your feet . The most important test of quality , of course , is not how many services are dispensed or how much money is spent on the patient 's behalf , but whether the person gets well and stays that way . All managed-care plans scrutinize patients ' use of services such as office visits , lab tests and hospital days ( called utilization ) , but the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcomes ) . Since almost all plans say they watch outcomes , here are some simple questions to find out whether they really do : Ask the network to tell you how many unplanned surgeries patients had last year , not just how many operations were performed overall ( this research lets the network know whether its doctors are doing an adequate job of anticipating the need for surgery ) . Also , ask how many of its hospital admissions were actually re-admissions within 30 days of discharge ( suggesting that doctors are discharging patients too soon ) . The point is n't for you to analyze the answers  --  most of the answers will be too complicated for a lay person to decipher  --  it 's to test whether the plan collects the right data . If it does n't , move to another plan or protest loudly to the one you 've got . One way managed-care plans cut costs is to restrict patients ' access to specialists or at least discourage it . To this end , most HMOs and POSs have " gatekeepers , " primary-care doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most PPOs place few or no restrictions on you . If it 's important to you to be able to see a specialist on your own initiative , pick a plan with no gatekeeper . Such plans are becoming less common , however , and are likely to dwindle further under President Clinton 's anticipated reforms . Next , ask about preventive services . Whether a plan does all it can to keep you healthy is highly significant . Some plans leave it up to you to get preventive care or not , as you choose . Others mail general announcements and reminders , and still others keep individual records on patients and follow up with letters or phone messages if , say , a patient is overdue for a mammogram . Ask the plan you 're investigating how it makes sure patients get preventive services . While you may consider personal contacts a nuisance , they do indicate that a plan is serious about your health . Finally , ask about accreditation . Although some state insurance departments monitor HMOs and PPOs for solvency and sometimes mediate consumer complaints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the federal government " qualifies " HMOs to receive payments from Medicare or Medicaid , quality standards are not very rigorous , and there is no federal oversight of PPOs . ( POSs have federal oversight only if they are affiliated with HMOs . ) Recently , however , two voluntary accrediting agencies have begun certifying managed-care plans on more stringent quality measures than ever before . The National Committee for Quality Assurance , which evaluates HMOs , has accredited about 50 of the 546 plans in the U.S. since it began work in 1991 . The American Accreditation Program has vetted about 120 of the estimated 500 PPOs since it got under way in 1990 . Plans without accreditation are not necessarily below par , but those that have chosen to pay the fee ( generally $9,000 for PPOs and as much as $75,000 for HMOs ) and passed the accrediting standards offer an extra assurance of quality . In short , you should n't subtract points from a plan that lacks accreditation but should give bonus points to one that does . HOW HAPPY WILL YOU BE ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient satisfaction . But it 's not enough . A chaotic waiting room or a phone system operated by computers instead of people may drive you wild . If so , ask the plan 's representative about both . Find out how long you 'll have to wait for an appointment . The average for an urgent visit to an HMO physician , for example , is about two days ( flat-out emergencies , of course , are handled immediately ) , while the wait for a routine visit averages four weeks . Discover too how much time with the doctor is allotted per patient ( average : about 15 minutes for all managed-care plans ) . You may also want to ask about demographics . Is your age group in the majority or the minority of the plan 's members ? Being in the majority often means that more services and attention will be directed to your concerns . Find out whether the plan compiles a patient-satisfaction survey and , if so , ask for a copy . Most HMOs and some PPOs do , and it 's an indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if doctors are formally rewarded with raises or bonuses for good reviews from patients . Again , it shows that patients ' views really count . One of the more traumatic things that can happen to you in a managed-care plan is to lose the doctor who has been treating you . Turnover rates in medical networks range from 5% to 15% a year , depending on the type of contracts doctors sign . Some plans will allow you to continue with a doctor who has left , at the plan 's expense , until treatment is completed . Others will require you to switch immediately . Be sure to ask about a plan 's policy , especially if you have a condition that may require lengthy treatment . Finally , ask how disputes between you and the plan over your care are resolved . A formal grievance procedure , with a panel of medical reviewers , is best . Worst is an ad hoc approach , with no systematic response to these problems . Also ask what percentage of disputes were resolved within one month . It should be 75% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at resolving hassles or , worse , is generating serious problems . Either way , you 'll want to factor the response into your thinking . If your employer has offered you good choices and you 've chosen well , you may turn out to be as happy with your managed-care plan as Margaret Friedman is . Belying the popular stereotype that older people detest managed care , Friedman , 74 , has been a member of Minneapolis ' second largest HMO , Group Health , for 16 years . Asserts Friedman : " The only way I 'll be against health-care reform is if they make me switch out of managed care . " FIVE QUESTIONS YOU MUST GET ANSWERED Q 1 How dedicated is the plan to offering and promoting preventive services ? A The best plans vigorously promote preventive services , such as immunization and cholesterol screening . If a plan plays down these activities , you may want to select another network . Q 2 Does the plan conduct a patient survey each year ? A A network that surveys patients regularly will be more attuned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that refuse to disclose the results . Q 3 How much doctor turnover does the plan experience each year ? A Lower is better . The average turnover for fee-based doctors , typically those in PPOs , is 5% annually . For salaried physicians , who normally work for HMOs , it 's about 10% . If a plan 's turnover is much higher than either benchmark , physician morale may be low . Q 4 What percent of the plan 's doctors are board certified ? A A 70% board-certification rate  --  about average for HMOs and PPOs  --  is acceptable . Also , make sure the board that certifies your doctor is one of the 24 recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties . You can find out by calling the ABMS at 800-776-2387 . Q 5 Is the network accredited ? A This is not a requirement , but it certainly is a plus . The accreditation agencies with the most stringent requirements are the National Committee for Quality Assurance , for HMOs , and the American Accreditation Program , for PPOs . <p>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
