When I crossed the border on foot at Scobey six months after the general amnesty , and two weeks after Dad passed on , no brass bands were playing  --  but it was a well-known fact that even the actual vets did n't get parades . It was a typical eastern Montana March day  --  wind that had took a running start at the mountains then raced across the plains to cut your skin like stiff paper . There 's a way the land rolls along the Hi-line-one rise blinding into the next  --  that makes it look like sky , turned hard . Outcrops of rock are gray as bone and you 're just in the middle of it all , one more blowing thing from nowhere to anywhere . It 's the kind of place you either love because you have n't been anywhere else , or love for the simple reason that you have  --  and are relieved to be back . <p> I stood in the U.S. Customs booth , getting my bearings . I declared myself an American citizen , listed my mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been in Canadian vacation , and swore I had nothing of material value to declare . Just when I thought the dude was going to inquire how long I had been away  --  nine years would be hard to account for  --  he asked me where I 'd went to high school . <p> " Milk River . " <p> He raised his eyebrows . I 'd seen such tests on TV . Next he 'd want to know who won the World Series in 1952 or what was the capital of Missouri . But the fact was , the man was merely starved for conversation . <p> " Class of . . . ? " <p> " Sixty-seven . " Here came the big one : Where 'd I serve ? <p> " Then you must have known Earl Stromeier , year behind you ? I played hoops against his brother Marky . " <p> " Do tell . " <p> " What do you hear of Earl ? " <p> I shook my head . I did n't hear of anybody . <p> " Somebody mentioned he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swimming pool . " <p> I cocked my head to show polite amazement . The two facts that came back to me about Earl were that he wore a flag on the flap of his jean jacket and that he was a regular viewer of Gilligan 's Island . He used to imitate the rich old guy , the one who was Mr. Magoo 's voice , but he was n't very good at it . <p> " Earl always had ambition , " I agreed , and that was enough to pass me through . <p> So , how did I feel being returned at last ' This was a moment I had pictured more than once . I had imagined I 'd stop feeling like a stranger , stop having to explain my whys and wherefores to anyone who wanted to know , stop being surprised at where I found myself . I stood still and paid attention . South of the border the pavement changed from black to gray , plus the distances got shorter because they were reported in miles instead of kilometers . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I thought . <p> Exhaust was coming from the tailpipe of the one idling automobile , a green Pontiac with two women in the front seat , and another in the back . The driver was Mom , but she did n't fling open her door at the sight of her only child . Instead , she pointed in my direction and the friend behind patted her shoulder and wagged her head . I walked over to the rolled-up window and knocked . <p> Mom pressed a button and the glass lowered partway , as though she were going to ask directions of a stranger of whom she was more than a little uncertain . Her eyes were invisible behind her shades , so I made the first move . <p> " Guess who ? " <p> " Do n't you have luggage ? " <p> " I mailed a box . You know me : travel light . " <p> Mom sighed , as if this news confirmed her worst fears . The rear door opened and one of Mom 's bridge club regulars got out . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my past life . <p> She smiled , pleased that I had remembered her name , then caught herself and made a pinched face . " You 'll have to ride in the middle , Norman , " she announced , employing my official name rather than what most people have called me since sixth grade , Sky . " Even with your long legs . I get carsick over the hump , and the cooler will only fit if it 's against the door , so it has to be you . " <p> " You bet . " I scooted in . The air was a combination of heater , cigarettes , and toilet water , battled to a tie score . I settled down and treated myself to a behind-the-scenes inspection of Mom 's head . Her hair was collected into a netted bun , and the dark right lens of her glasses confronted me from the mirror . It occurred to me that she had never once visited while I lived in Canada . <p> " New wheels ? " I smoothed the plush upholstery and rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drive shaft . <p> " Death benefits , " Mrs. Marion accused in a whisper , reminding me that I was now half an orphan . <p> That was the last word exchanged for the next seventy miles . On the car radio , the " Farm Report " was followed by the " Holy Redeemer Half-Hour , " and that by " Swap , Shop , or Barter . " There were lots of call-ins who wanted to unload handyman 's specials or like-new stereo AM/FM 8-track tape decks with quadrophonic sound , and one set of dishes with only two salads missing , but no takers . <p> After the first twenty mires , Mrs. Marion got the urge for a smoke . She tapped a Salem from a snap case in her purse and held it over the emergency brake until Mom pushed the lighter into the dashboard . When it popped out , Mrs. Marion leaned across the seat , damped the filtered end of the cigarette in her mouth , pressed the other against the red coils , and inhaled three or four deep huffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thanks . There was a half-full ashtray built into the side of her door . <p> Shy of Wolf Point I tried to change the subject of the disgrace of my being a draft dodger . " Earl Stromeier 's moved to Billings , " I said . <p> " Earl 's schooling was paid for by VA benefits , " volunteered Mrs. Marion , and dug for another smoke . I got the , point . You would n't find Earl riding in the middle . <p> I could n't place Mom 's front-seat companion , but I was interested in the way she held her head arched back , like the hammer on a pistol , ready to fire . She had the look of a shop teacher I once knew who had no patience for excuses  --  of which , he had often reminded me , I was a poor example . <p> " Personally , it would n't hurt my feelings a bit to see Canada . " The mystery woman had a raspy voice , and though her announcement was technically addressed to me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face she watched . Her cheeks tightened in satisfaction when Mom shot her a stabbed-in-the-heart glance . <p> " Evelyn , " Mrs. Marion hushed . " Think . " Evelyn looked back at me and pulled down one corner of her mouth to show she had previously done just that . I noticed she was more my age than Mom 's . <p> " It 's a beautiful country , " I said . " I 'd be glad to show it to you sometime , though I take no responsibility for the weather . " <p> " I 've got a suitcase packed , " Evelyn muttered under her breath . <p> That day I thought she was merely using a figure of speech , but it happened she was serious . Later , at home , when I asked for the low-down-that was the second thing I had to be grateful to Evelyn for : providing me with a topic after Mom had finished pointing out all the new furniture  --  Mom mouthed the word " divorced . " <p> " Anybody I knew ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brick , but I guess that 's not enough for some . " Mom was a defender of the matrimonial state . She had often confided that she had endured more than most would bear in order to uphold her vows . <p> I was even more interested in Evelyn , now that I knew she was a fugitive from civilized society . <p> " Well , was she just along for the ride today or what ? " <p> Mom shrugged , her shoulders slow and heavy with meaning , and brought the conversation back to where she wanted it . " It 's my curse , " she said . " I feel sorry , try to be nice . And look what it gets me . " <p> Dad , she really meant , and now , me . I nodded in sympathy . <p> " She 's Betty Marion 's cousin , " Mom continued . " Come visiting to lick her wounds . " <p> Songs play in my head all the time , one after the other , as if my brain is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume 's set a peg too low for me to make out all the words . This time , however , I caught a few definite bars of a new tune , and it sounded not one bit bad at all . <p> Now that I was back , Mom expected that I 'd take up where I left off . Actually , somewhat beyond that point . Without Dad around , Mom was horsepower with nothing to move . She took my stay in a foreign country as indication of an aptitude for political science . She had big plans for my enrollment at Northern State College and was triple-pissed when I declined to fill out the application forms she had sent for . <p> In fact , she was still barely speaking to me on Monday morning when we went downtown to collect my inheritance . Either Dad had forgiven me my desertion or he had put off too long making good his parting threat to cut me out of his will , because there was an account with thirteen thousand dollars of insurance money drawing interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to work , though on what I could n't say . Still , if it was in my pocket it 'd be handy when an idea blossomed . <p> Mom , of course , despaired of this plan and reminded me of all the months Dad paid into the premium , all the things she went without , never complaining , like reusing a paper towel at least once before throwing it away and limiting herself to a solitary teaspoon of instant coffee on weekdays . <p> So first thing out of the bank I steered her into the Do-Re-Me and ordered us each a bottomless cup while we considered the menu . <p> " You think you 're funny , " Mom whispered . " Well you 're not . " <p> Actually " funny " was n't what I was after . Somewhere along the line I had decided it was easier to concede a point than to argue it , to give freely what people said they wanted and to wish for their happiness . This was a theory I held onto against the evidence of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case in point . She had claimed on the telephone that her dearest hope was that I would come back and be company for her , but now that I had , she did n't know whet to do with me . <p> I ordered pie to celebrate , me the huckleberry and Mom the sour cream raisin . Then , while we were waiting for it to appear , I glanced out the window and there was Evelyn looking in . She did n't give me the chance to wave , just walked through the door and occupied the empty chair next to me as if the meeting had been set up in advance . Mom 's back got straighter , and I signaled for another place setting . <p> " What 'll it be ? " I asked Evelyn . <p> She lifted her chin , surveyed the options posted along the wall and chose the liver plate . <p> " I eat what I do n't make , " she told us . " I 'd rather spend my time at a good double feature than slice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental arrest , the two causes for it tied for number one . <p> " It 's eleven o'clock in the morning , " she protested . Then , taking a short breath , she added , " That meat could have been sitting here for a week " <p> Evelyn 's answer was to make her eyes big , as though she were a concerned third-party observer  --  a technique that threw off Mom 's timing . I made a note to remember to use it , and reached for the brown envelope the bank had given me . <p> " What do you think ? " I asked Evelyn , and dumped out the thirteen thousand dollars , all neat in stacks with paper bands around them , on her Summer Pleasures of Montana place mat . Mom flapped a napkin over my fortune , but not before Evelyn had nodded . <p> " Spending money is a thing I want to learn how to do , " she said , and patted her purse . " I 've got a stash of my own , and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of living death . " <p> You would n't call Evelyn small . Her shoulders were rounded beneath a lavender windbreaker , and her short , thick legs disappeared into scuffed brown boots . Her hair , coarse and graying at the temples , was cropped shorter than mine , and from each of her earlobes there dangled a gold hoop that , on closer inspection , turned out to be a coiled snake eating its own tail . She wore no makeup and smelled like soap . Her eyes were her most startling feature . It was their brightness , as if she had a two-hundred-watt light bulb lit behind them . She could have stood in the middle of a dark church and brightened up the farthest corner . <p> Nobody approved when Evelyn and I started going out . Mom and her friends warned me she was on the rebound , that who I was did n't matter , that I could have been anybody in pants  --  which is pretty much what I was . They said I should meet more people , that they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who worked at a job with a health plan . I did n't say yes and I did n't say no , but all the while they were bragging about Blue Cross and dental work I was wondering how Evelyn would look with her face relaxed . <p> For some time , she herself refused to acknowledge my interest , pretending it was pure coincidence when I took the seat next to hers at the local movie house the night of our lunch . And why should n't we share a bite afterwards ? For certain , we each packed enough cash to pay half a check . <p> For a while we arranged to run into each other accidentally . At the end of an evening in each other 's company I 'd wait for her to drop mention of a future destination , and then the next night there we 'd both be at the Steerio Lounge or Bowl-Till-You-Drop . It took a good month for me to call her at her cousin 's , and when I did , I learned something new : Evelyn might pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the first to speak . <p> " Hello , " I said to dead air . <p> " What ? " <p> " You want to shack up ? " I asked , surprising myself . I had intended to ask Evelyn if she wanted to drive over to Shelby and eat spaghetti , but suddenly that seemed too small a question for her irritated tone of voice . <p> More dead air . <p> " Well ? " I asked again . There was no use making like she had heard me wrong . <p> " You 'll be sorry , " was all she answered . <p> Those were exactly the words that Mom employed when I broke the news , followed on the heels by , " Thank God your father did n't live to see this day . " <p> " Would you rather we got married first ? " <p> Mom filled her whistling teapot with water and slammed it on the stove to boil . " Are those my two choices ? Marriage or sin ? " <p> I said I guessed so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The next day I asked , and soon found out . <p> " Once was one time too many , " Evelyn stated , and put the subject of matrimony to bed . <p> Evelyn regularly got put out by the dreams that came to her just before she woke . On the dawn of the second morning in our furnished apartment over the movie house she complained that she had been walking through a yard sale , her arms loaded with bargains , when the property owners changed their minds , told the browsers to put everything back where they found it , and go home . Evelyn 's eyes had snapped open and her arms were folded tight across her chest . It took three cups of black coffee and my complete silence to shift her back into neutral . <p> Certain days , she had long periods of seething , when her peace of mind came as rare as a crowbar of sun from an overcast sky . When those moods arrived at bedtime , she 'd start on the edge of the mattress , tuck one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself into a tight cigar of exasperation . It was too hot . It was too cold . It was noisy . It was stuffy . Her life 's disappointments were a grocery list , of wrongs that she refused to talk about . <p> " Just nod if I 'm right , " I said one night about two A.M. " It 's got something to do with your divorce settlement . " <p> Her head did n't budge an inch , but her eyes narrowed . <p> I tried putting the words into her mouth . " You got cheated out of what was coming to you . " <p> If Evelyn had been still before , now she was a stone fence . <p> " It 's something I did . " My last blind guess . <p> She blinked , unclenched her features for a fraction of a second . " Do n't flatter yourself . " <p> It 's hard to explain , but I took it as a compliment first that she answered me , and second that I was n't at the seat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out of the direct line of her fire , made it bearable when she 'd turn her face , her lips pressed into a grim seam , from my kisses . " What it meant was , I was n't just anybody in pants . I was more like the exception to Evelyn 's general rule : a person worth explaining to , a person whose feelings Evelyn as soon would n't hurt , all things being equal . Special . <p> Sometimes I caught her watching me with more pleasure than pain  --  and that beats all the poetical words in the dictionary . You might say Evelyn 's suspicion of happiness was a challenge I rose to in a contest she did n't entirely declare to be out of my league . It was a long shot : nobody , not even her , would blame me if I failed  --  though sometimes , I 'll allow , she seemed to be betting against me . She kept her suitcase in plain view . She expected me to find fault with the strange frozen food she served , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions she warned me were off-limits in bed . No matter what I did or did n't do , Evelyn hung to the reins of her doubts as tight as she did to the money she would n't spend . She kept herself ready to be the first one of us to say that she did n't give a shit . <p> The thing was , I recognized her bossiness for what it was : the instruction booklet that up to then my life had been lacking . It was a relief for questions to come with the decisions already made , to have firm opinions to rub against . After passing so many fair days that did n't count toward the final score , Evelyn was a thunderstorm that woke me up and gave me something to do . <p> Bearpaw Lake State Park was twenty miles west of town , and one hot May afternoon Evelyn and I drove over in her car to sightsee . I was glad for the chance , since I had n't been in water deeper than a bathtub since 1968 . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reminded her of her honeymoon trip to Hawaii  --  so while I cooled off she walked over to check out the administration buildings . We rendezvoused on the picnic grounds two hours later . <p> " You missed a good time , " I told her . " I 'm a new man . " <p> " And I 'm on the payroll , " she stated . " Meet the staff cook . " <p> " You hate to cook , " was my first reaction . <p> " I hate to cook for me , " Evelyn corrected . " I hate to do anything for free . Getting paid is another story . Besides , what else do I know how to do ? Can you see me in a store ? Selling dresses ? " <p> I tried to imagine Evelyn behind a counter with an inviting smile on her face , but the image scrambled , like a TV picture during a blizzard . <p> " When do you start ? " I asked . <p> " An hour ago . This is my break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper . " <p> When Evelyn went back to the kitchen I sat under a tree , watching the light play on the little waves . There was a part of me that minded how she went about her business as though it had nothing to do with me . We had plenty of money to live on and the subject of employment had never come up . I had held down jobs of every description in Regina , from construction to checkout register to maintenance , but they all had in common the same drawback . The truth was , what I hated about working was n't the working , it was the working fort <p> But on the other hand I could n't very well sit home and count dust balls while Evelyn fed a crew . Her decision to get hired presented me with a far-reaching dilemma : to follow her or be left behind . I was at a crossroads similar to the one I had faced before , but that time it was go or go or go , Vietnam or Canada or the pen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worse , and that turned out to be not so hard . I did n't even hunt , which is strange for a Montanan , but there you are . Plus , no way could I picture myself behind bars . <p> I about drove Dad crazy , who blamed me on Mom . He brought me over to the Elks one night and had me talked to by all his buddies . " It 's not too late to be a man , Norman , " one guy advised , meaning sign up , but I took his advice another way and headed north . Now I could never be sure if my inheritance from Dad was intent or oversight because neither deal made complete sense , and there was nobody who I knew to ask  --  so it was up to me to choose which . I tried to hear clearly through the static of my thoughts , and all I kept getting was an echo of the word " home " from Evelyn 's mouth . That was answer enough . <p> I had hours to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravel path down to the park entrance . The cars raced east and west , exceeding the speed limit . Finally one of them , a blue Chevy with Oregon plates , slowed down as it approached where I stood . I thought at first they were going to offer me a lift  --  I 'd never been to Oregon  --  but their goal was staring me in the face : across the highway was a red and white Conoco station . The driver of the Chevy and I noticed at the same instant that the place was deserted , with a FOR SALE sign posted in the window . This news caused him to speed back up , look further , but it had the reverse effect on me . At the first break in traffic I crossed the road . <p> Interested parties were directed to dial a number and inquire at Deja-View Realtors . I used the pay phone attached to the side of the building , and was encouraged to find that it still worked . <p> " Deja-View . Irma . " The voice was cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conoco at Bearpaw ? What do they want for it ? " <p> " Twenty thousand ? " Irma answered as though she was asking me . <p> " Cash ? " <p> " This is George , is n't it ? " she demanded . I recognized her tone from TV shows  --  it was how people sounded on Candid Camera when they began to suspect the truth of their circumstance . <p> " I 've got thirteen thousand in my back pocket this minute , " I said to reassure her . <p> " Sandy ? " <p> " My name is Norman Dial , " I said . " I 'm here at the station as we speak . " <p> There was a pause on the other end of the line while Irma waited for me to add more , to give myself away . When I did n't , her voice changed back to where it had started . <p> " Do n't budge a step , honey . I 'm on my way . " <p> It took Irma fifteen minutes , but that gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except I did n't know what I should be looking for . The plate glass of the office part was streaked and dirty , and the lock was broken on the men 's room . The sink inside had a brown stain under the dripping faucet of the cold , which spelled iron in the water . I assumed that Irma would not expect me to have uncovered this drawback , and so I felt at an advantage when I heard her car pull in . " Deja-View " was stenciled in white on the green metallic paint . <p> " Norm ? " Irma held out her hand to be shook . She was a compact woman dressed Western , that is , pointy boots , a shirt with snaps instead of buttons , and a fringed suede vest . Her hair was blond and beauty parlor-arranged with unlikely rises and falls . Compared to her I felt seedy , untucked in , so I touched my pocket and mentioned the iron problem . <p> " Nothing some Comet wo n't cure " Irma said . " But I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietor who keeps the place up . This location is a gold mine . It commands the park . Nobody can get in or out without passing your pumps . " <p> Or by , I thought . People from as far away as Oregon were disappointed not to stop , but I did n't want to betray this insight . The way Irma described the Conoco put me in mind of a fort , and that recalled the customs booth on the border where this all began , and that made me think of Mom in her car and how she would feel about me spending Dad 's insurance money this way instead of on an A.A. degree . <p> " You quoted twenty thousand ? " <p> " That 's the asking price . " Irma leaned toward me to confide a secret . " I happen to know that the owner is desperate . Make a reasonable offer . " <p> " What would you call ' reasonable ' ? " <p> Irma lowered her voice still further . " Knock off ten percent . " Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be overheard selling short her client just because she wanted to help me out . " Fifteen . " <p> I figured the arithmetic in my head . Even at this bargain basement rate I was still short four bills , and I confessed as much . <p> " You could put down earnest money to freeze the property , " Irma , my new best friend , advised . <p> " What 's that ? " The term was news to me . <p> " A simple deposit . No risk to you since it 's all returned if you 're unable to secure financing . But this way you wo n't run the gamble of another buyer moving in while you assemble your assets . You 'll hold the exclusive right to purchase for ten business days . " She paused , bent closer . " I happen to know that a couple from California has an appointment to view this station with another realtor later this very week . " <p> We both knew what California meant . I could see the couple , tan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could still ace them out . <p> " I 'm obliged by law to tell you , though , " Irma stated , " that there may be a penalty for changing your mind . If you harbor any doubt , only put down what you can afford to lose . " <p> I thought of Mom throwing up her hands in despair . I thought of Evelyn , not a ten-minute walk distant , probably peeling potatoes at this very moment . I thought of me , wearing a uniform at last , guarding the entrance to Bearpaw Lake . I knew the words were right when I heard myself say them . <p> " Draw up the papers . Will you take twelve thousand down ? " <p> " But that 's too . . . " Irma began , then shook her hair , laughed at her own caution . " Norm , you 're a man who knows his mind . Let me invite you to step over to my car and sign on the do , tted line . " <p> Evelyn had never told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had never asked . I was afraid to now , but I had no choice since I could n't go to Mom , and the banker was convinced I was mental after I had dosed out my whole account . <p> " A pump jockey ? " Evelyn and I were stopped at the station so that she could see for herself the advantages of the location . She damped her mouth as if to hold my proposal steady and get a better view . Then she let it float free . " Well , I guess you 've got to do something . " <p> She looked tired after her afternoon of labor , like some of the frire had gone out of her . <p> " I 'm short five thousand . It 'd be in both our names . " <p> Evelyn turned toward me in the seat , her face flushed , her eyes glittery in sudden anger . <p> " Take it from me . Joint property does n't count for shit . " <p> " This time it will , " I promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I said but did n't change her expression . She spoke in a voice that scratched the air . <p> " I have a daughter . Had one . " <p> " Did something happen to her ? Did she die ? " <p> Evelyn shifted her body , stared into the windshield . Her hands were clasped together in her lap . <p> " Dead to me , " she said . " She stayed . " <p> I started the engine and nosed the car onto the highway . We drove back to town in silence , and as the miles rolled by I did n't know if by this revelation we were broke up or broke through . <p> " It would n't be that way with us , " I finally offered in my own defense . <p> " You 're not doing this for yourself , " she thought out loud . " It 's all because you do n't want to be left alone . " <p> I did n't deny this fact , so it came down to whether for Evelyn this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave me or take me along . <p> Instead of signing a contract between us , making it a loan , Evelyn and I got married after all . The only things she hated worse than judges were lawyers and priests , so we stood in Mom 's living room before the lesser of the three evils . <p> I would n't call the reception a wild celebration , not by any means . From the point of view of the guests it was a mix of " Too bad " and " It could be worse " with a little bit of " What the hell " thrown in on the side . Mom had insisted on hosting , saying it was a far cry better than us greeting the world in the used mobile home that was Evelyn 's and my wedding gift to ourselves . Besides , the familiarity of her friends gave Mom strength , and Mrs. Marion could provide the live entertainment  --  a rendition of double-hand keyboard favorites . <p> Evelyn wore a dark red dress and matching shoes , and her hair was swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow out . With her thumb she kept turning the gold band on her finger , a ring bought with the last of Dad 's insurance . She sat with her feet apart and pressed onto the floor , her shoulders hunched .

But today they were little girl 's eyes , alarmed to find themselves in a grown woman 's face . Their expression reminded me of someone who had just woken up and could n't place where she was . I stroked my wife 's arm , and at my touch , Evelyn 's wholes body tensed , ready to defend itself . But her eyes , her eyes were n't at all sure what to think . <p> <p> By Michael Dorris <p>                 @ @ @ @
