Mother and Father can take down the pictures and store the rocking horse in the attic , pluck the magnetic alphabet off the refrigerator door . Maybe they can find some other use for the room with the yellow wallpaper . Or they could close it up and seal it like a tomb so they can go about their grieving for the merry little girl they love and are about to lose . <P> In the tidy backyard of the Cape Cod-style house with the cranberry shutters , Jessica DeBoer is having a picnic with her dog Miles . Her mother watches her through the blinds on the kitchen window . Everything feels so very normal . But the clock ticks loudly and the blinds all stay down and an answering machine screens the phone calls . Reporters keep calling  --  and sad friends , and adoption experts  --  and strangers who feel sorry for them . <P> When the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that Jan and Roberta DeBoer , a printer and a homemaker , had no right to keep the baby they have tried to adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scorching fuse on a time bomb . The DeBoers were given a month to turn her over to her biological parents in Iowa , Dan and Cara Schmidt . This afternoon they have 26 days left . <P> " I sit here and count the stupid hours and the days and mark them off a dumb calendar as to my last moment , my last hour , my last kiss . " Roberta sits in the forest-green dining room , sipping herbal tea out of a mug decorated with little footprints , hearts and the words IT 'S A GIRL . How is she holding herself together ? " People ca n't understand , " she says . " They think I 'm falling to pieces nonstop in front of Jessi . But I would never do that . " And then Robby DeBoer breaks down , heaving and weeping . The cries are not plaintive , not whimpers , but sobs that send her body shaking and her voice coming from deep inside her . And she is angry . <P> " We let our government make irrational decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court . " They 're going to walk away just like Michigan did and say , ' Wish we could have done something but there 's nothing to do because our laws dictate otherwise . ' I wonder if they could take their little two-year-old kids and walk into a black forest and just leave the child and walk away . . . And not feel the pain . . . How not to feel the pain . . . ? " <P> In this case , everyone feels the pain . Here are Jessica 's two sets of parents , those who conceived her and those who have raised her , fighting a passionate battle over who gets to keep her . Then there are all the other adoptive parents in the U.S. , many of whom have been watching this ghastly spectacle unravel in the courts and go to sleep wondering whether their precious child will stay their child . And finally , of course , there is Jessica , the one party to the case who has most at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judges whose rulings at times have seemed little better than suggesting that she be sawed in half . <P> A LEGAL LABYRINTH <P> Cara Clausen was 28 and single , working in an Iowa shipping factory , when she got pregnant three years ago . She had just broken up with her boyfriend Dan , a trucker , to start dating Scott Seefeldt  --  so it was Scott 's name she put on the birth certificate when Jessica was born . Two days later , Cara waived her parental rights and put the baby up for adoption .
