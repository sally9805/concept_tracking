Why ca n't technology rescue the world from the mess that technology created ? Is n't there a quick fix ? Scientists know there is n't , but that does n't stop them from musing about fanciful schemes for mechanically or chemically refurbishing the ozone layer in short order . By discussing and critiquing these ideas , researchers hope to educate the public about the dangers of climate engineering as well as learn for themselves the feasibility of various solutions . <P> " One of the common suggestions is , ' Why do n't we just ship L.A. 's ozone up ? ' " says chemist Sherwood Rowland . " Well , 30% of the ozone is in the stratosphere , and it drifts down from there to the lower atmosphere rather than the other way around . The energy that would be needed to move the ozone up is about 2 1/2 times all of our current global power use . If you could take every power plant in the world , every piece of coal and every oil tanker , the energy would be insufficient  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the ozone up there . " <P> Considering that there are 350 million tons of ozone in the stratosphere , it would take 350,000 trips by specially outfitted 747 freighters , which can carry 100 tons of cargo , to replace even a tenth of the protective gas . Alternatively , climate engineers could shoot multi-ton bullets made up of frozen ozone into the upper reaches of atmosphere . But the technology for designing and building the tens of thousands of big guns that would be required does not yet exist  --  not to mention the fact that compressed ozone is dangerously explosive . Furthermore , neither of these solutions attacks the heart of the problem , those long-lived CFCs , which would break down any replacement ozone as well . <P> As a result , some researchers are focusing their attention on the culprit molecules rather than the victims . Atmospheric scientists Richard Turco of UCLA and Ralph Cicerone of U.C. Irvine are exploring the idea of injecting into the stratosphere two chemicals  --  propane and ethane  --  that would combine with CFCs to produce an extremely weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That strategy would interrupt the CFCs ' 100-year destruction cycle , and has the further advantage of requiring only 1,000 jumbo-jet flights over a single , critical 30-day period every year for the next several decades . The products involved are readily available . However , in order for the process to work efficiently , these chemicals must reach from 15 km to 25 km ( 9 miles to 15 miles ) above the earth , and airplanes can not fly through that entire range . Moreover , the researchers calculate , there is a chance the plan could backfire and accelerate ozone depletion . <P> At Princeton University , physicist Thomas Stix has suggested using lasers to blast the CFCs out of the air before they can reach the stratosphere and attack the ozone . His idea is to tune the lasers to a series of wavelengths so that only the offensive molecules would be destroyed . Admittedly , the energy requirement would still be exorbitant , but Stix believes that a 20-fold improvement in the overall efficiency of this approach could make it feasible . Even so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tested and built before the first CFC molecule could get zapped . If this is the best idea for reviving the ozone layer , an ounce of prevention is worth more than many tons of cure .
