<p> The biggest wildfire of the season raged in the mountains of the Central Coast yesterday , doubling in size to cover about 45,000 acres of wild country and licking the outskirts of San Luis Obispo . <p> The fire was so big , so hot and so dangerous that crews often had to step aside and simply let it burn . By last night , the blaze was only 30 percent contained . <p> " All we 're doing is making a stand , and where we ca n't , we just get out of the way , " said fire Captain Bob Bergstrom of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection . <p> The blaze started Sunday , broke loose Monday and ran wild yesterday . San Luis Obispo felt like a town under siege yesterday , surrounded by smoke and the sound of helicopters carrying water buckets to the fire lines . <p> The biggest fear yesterday was that a change in the wind might send the northern edge of the fire toward the coast , where nervous residents of Morro Bay and Cayucos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evacuation of the Lopez Canyon area , where there are ranch operations and some homes . <p> At least 54 buildings , including 31 homes and six trailers , have been destroyed by the fire , and about 1,000 were threatened . Because the area around the Cuesta Summit on Highway 101 , just north of San Luis Obispo , has not burned in 60 years , there is a huge fuel load of dry brush . <p> Some of the burned area is mixed chaparral brush and oak , some is pine and grassland . It resembles the coastal hills around the Bay Area , and it is very dry after a disappointing rainy season and a long summer . The temperature was in the low 90s yesterday . <p> The fire cut Highway 101 , one of the main routes between Northern and Southern California , at the Cuesta Summit and closed it for nearly 30 hours before it reopened late last night . The six-lane highway , which usually carries 39,000 vehicles a day , had to be cleared of downed power lines , burned signs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway , which one worker described as a path of charcoal . <p> Highway 41 , between Atascadero and Morro Bay , remained closed . Authorities said the fire started in the Cerro Alto campground along Highway 41 and was deliberately set . <p> Traffic from 101 was diverted over Highway 46 , between Paso Robles and the coast south of Cayucos , but the winding two-lane highway could not handle the volume , producing a huge traffic jam . <p> The fire burned its way right to the outskirts of the city of San Luis Obispo , where houses run up to the edges of the hills , and ate into the outskirts of the town of Atascadero . As some fled for their lives  --  about 600 people spent Monday night in Red Cross shelters and motels in Paso Robles and Arroyo Grande  --  others made a stand trying to save their homes . <p> " The worst was last night , when my uncle and four firefighters got surrounded by the fire , " said Duffy Lochhead , describing a moment of terror in Atascadero . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the family home when the fire turned on them . They were able to use water from a swimming pool , the fire passed over , and the house was saved . <p> Yesterday , Lochhead said , the stiff winds that plagued the region Monday night calmed a bit , though the sky still rained embers . <p> " The worst part is past us , I think , " he said , " but we do have lots of little fires all around the house . " <p> Others in the area were not as fortunate as Lochhead and returned yesterday to assess the damage . <p> The ridgetop home and workshop of sculptor John Jagger  --  who has a number of major pieces on display in San Francisco , including a steel figure of a man with a bird 's head in the main library  --  were destroyed Monday . Jagger returned yesterday to the neighborhood of $ 750,000-homes , now with a vast view of miles of rolling , blackened hills . <p> The fire had also obliterated at least six of his sculptures , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 7-foot bronze horse I was working on , " he said . " Bronze goes at 1,800 degrees , and there was not a piece of it left in the studio . There was not a thing I could save . " <p> Jagger and his wife , Reina , hiked across their property yesterday , wondering what to do next . <p> " Now we have to decide whether to sell or to rebuild and put up with this Schwarzenegger/Conan- style landscape we 're surrounded with , " Jagger said . <p> All day yesterday , convoys of fire trucks moved south on Highway 101 . Fire crews from the state Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention were on hand , as were crews from all of the Central Coast , from Los Angeles and from the Santa Clara Valley . <p> By afternoon , there were 1,700 firefighters on hand , 167 fire engines , 30 bulldozers and 11 helicopters on the line . As of Tuesday , authorities spent $ 4 million fighting the fire . <p> " It 's been like a firefighters ' Woodstock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Grill near the fire line along Highway 41 . The Highway 41 outpost has served as a command post since the fire started Sunday . <p> And as in most fires , there were dramatic moments of apparent caprice . The fire spared two bulldozer operators who were cutting fire breaks in Tassajara Creek . The fire moved so quickly that it first trapped and then passed right over their machines , leaving them unharmed , said Jean Satterthwaite , a spokeswoman with the Forestry Department . <p> Elsewhere , in the midst of frenetic action , firefighter Tim Negranti 's life was saved by standing still . <p> A wall of flames surged toward Negranti and other firefighters as they used five bulldozers to clear a patch of ground near Atascadero and waited as the flame consumed the dense brush around them Monday night . <p> " It was just like a volcano . Instead of lava , there were flames everywhere , " Negranti said . " If we left that circle , we would have been history . " <p> The fire came close to burning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been moved yesterday , and veterinarians were preparing to tranquilize the zoo 's collection of big cats  --  including two tigers and two leopards  --  so that they could be moved when the wind changed . <p> The zoo 's bird collection was taken to the basement of the town 's City Hall , where the cries of parrots and macaws mixed with the sound of fire sirens . <p> The California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo was evacuated as the fire scorched 75 acres of campus range land . Fall classes at the 15,500-student university do not start until next month . <p> Walter Rice , director of graduate school management at Cal Poly said he was taking no chances and had packed two automobiles with irreplaceable books and documents . <p> " I ca n't see any flames just now , only gray smoke , but I remember another fire like this , in 1985 , " he said . " It went on for a week , then it turned and came right up into my back yard . " <p> The Red Cross said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims through its local offices in the Bay Area . <p> Meanwhile , other fires were burning in California yesterday . One , in Mendocino County , was in a mixed redwood forest near Anderson Valley . About 600 firefighters had the blaze 50 percent controlled last night . That blaze started Monday when a bulldozer caught fire in a narrow canyon . <p> A 2,800-acre blaze started yesterday at 12:50 p.m. near Sierraville and temporarily shut down a stretch of Highway 89 about 20 miles north of Truckee . The fire continued to burn out of control last night . <p> HIGHWAY 41 FIRE <p> . <p> * 54 BUILDINGS DESTROYED <p> * 600 EVACUEES <p> * HIGHWAY 41 CLOSED <p> * HIGHWAY 101 REOPENED AFTER 30 HOURS
