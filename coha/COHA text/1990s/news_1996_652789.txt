<p> IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE modern art  --  and especially modern portraiture  --  without Pablo Picasso . Today the Museum of Modern Art opens its third blockbuster Picasso exhibition since his death in 1973 at the age of 91 . The show , " Picasso and Portraiture , " presents seven decades of his portrait paintings and prints . <p> Although Picasso is widely acclaimed as the greatest artist of the 20th century , current attitudes toward him range from reverence to disdain . The New York Times asked artists , curators and museum directors to comment on Picasso 's relevance to them and contemporary art . ROBERT ATKINS ANDRES SERRANO Photographer <p> Picasso was important to me , especially as a teen-ager in art school . He was the first art superstar of the 20th century . My early work was narrative , so I looked hard at his blue and rose period paintings . Later it was the Cubist works . I think of my Ku Klux Klan pictures as portraits . I know that masked figures are a contradiction in terms , since individuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portraits are also full of contradictions . Distortion is their essence . James Joyce wrote about sitting for a painter who said he wanted to capture Joyce 's soul . " Forget the soul , " Joyce said . " Just get the tie right . " R. B. KITAJ Painter <p> Well , I can tell you this : When I try to exclude Picasso from my all-star team  --  nine painters from Giotto to Matisse  --  I ca n't . Picasso is the 10th , the designated hitter . I 'm a real sucker for some parts of his legend : Barcelona , the early Paris years , mesmerized by his long life in art . Are there better portraits this century , late Cezanne excluded , than about six Picassos ? Let me think . Some just as stunning Matisse ones , a Beckmann self-portrait maybe , and that 's about it . But nothing really better in my book than , say , his Gertrude Stein or one of the tough , early self-portraits or the best weeping woman . By chance , I 've just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but one is Bill Clinton , and it was a big thrill for me to sketch him in the Oval Office . I think the final pastel owes more to Gutzon Borglum than to Picasso . But I 've also begun an oil of a very fine lady I call the Modernist , and I 'll be damned if Picasso 's G. Stein  --  on my studio wall  --  is n't haunting my picture to distraction . CAROLYN CARR Deputy director of the National Portrait Gallery in Washington <p> Picasso is obviously one of the great figures in art . He 's entered the historical pantheon alongside artists like Michelangelo , but I do n't think he really affects contemporary artists ' work anymore . He 's too many generations removed . His direct influence ends in the 50 's with de Kooning ; since then it 's artists like Alice Neel or Chuck Close or Warhol who are the innovators . In today 's portraiture I see as many references to Sargent as to Picasso . LARRY RIVERS Painter <p> You 've caught me when I 'm finishing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've painted a lot of images of Picasso . You begin to see that he thought it all up ; there was nothing to guide him but himself . He made a fantastic thing out of his life . His personality became part of the work . He 's the end of a line of megalomaniacs , of individuals . But his work is also like listening to the music of Louis Armstrong . It 's the past . Why is it that museum directors and writers act as if there 's nobody else in the world besides Picasso ? I 've known Picasso 's biographer John Richardson for a long time , and recently I said to him : " What ? Another book about Picasso ? " Then there 's Norman Mailer 's book . It 's a cottage industry . <p> CARRIE MAE WEEMS Photographer and installation artist <p> Some people think of Picasso as a user or an exploiter . How you get work done is by exploiting yourself and your feelings , and sometimes people get in the way . The brilliance of Picasso was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to exploit those things around him . Everybody was exploiting African art , its masks , its people , its raw materials . He noticed its brilliance and tapped into its power to create a paradigm to construct Modernism , which was amazing . Picasso is the accepted voice of modernity . Love him or hate him , we also use Picasso as a way to talk about ourselves and our problems . <p> NANCY BURSON Conceptual artist and photographer <p> I took my 6-year-old , Kir , to see the movie " Toy Story . " Don Rickles is the voice of Mr. Potato Head , and he skews up his features and announces , " I 'm Picasso . " A week later it 's Kir making faces and saying , " I 'm Picasso , " but he is n't sure who Picasso is . So I explain that he was the first person to change people 's faces , the first " morpher , " even before Mommy and Daddy . And suddenly I realized I 'd never thought of my connection to Picasso in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had had parts of his face removed , so he 's got this tremendous prosthetic device covering a hole in his skull . Picasso is inspiring because he took the leap into ugliness and unrecognizability . This was a great shock to people , and it still is . MARIA MORRIS HAMBOURG Curator of photography at the Metropolitan Museum of Art <p> Picasso 's Synthetic Cubism was certainly an issue in photography of the 20 's and 30 's ; you see its influence on photographers like Maurice Tabard and Man Ray . What might relate to today 's work is the notion of a sort of theater of personality . His assuming a variety of roles in the work is something you might compare to Cindy Sherman , although I doubt she 's thought about it . But Picasso 's superstar approach of blind and vulgar and brutal megalomania is so distasteful that it 's probably something anybody I 'm interested in working with would want to flee . HUNG LIU Painter and installation artist <p> The Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing , where I studied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I joined a new graduate program in mural painting . They needed artists to decorate the new international airport and hotels . Even though art after Impressionism was n't taught , everybody knew about Picasso . I felt that we were n't so different from Picasso and the rest of the older generation . We , too , battled with models , rather than photographs or other representations . Now my sources are in photo images and other flat surfaces like calligraphy and diagrams . Before I left China , there was a show of Picasso drawings , but it was n't the " taboo " work . Even in the 80 's , the authorities considered Cubism too wild , too sexual , too disturbing . GLENN LIGON Painter and conceptual artist <p> Picasso was so relentless a portraitist . He represents the artist who was certain that a world could be created through his images . There 's that famous anecdote about his telling Gertrude Stein that she would grow to look like his portrait of her . It 's a pretty romantic view of art that allows no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of uncertainty . It 's interesting talking about Picasso now because for the first time I 've recently done conventional self-portraits . They 're screened photos that are more Warhol than Picasso . While Warhol was a relentless portraitist , too , there 's no sense of gaining access to an artist 's vision , but only to the mechanisms for making a portrait . THOMAS SOKOLOWSKI Director of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh <p> In Picasso 's portraits , more than any others , the presence of the artist overwhelms the sitter and allows little of the subject 's personality to come through . Think of Picasso 's famous remark to Gertrude Stein . But during the past few decades everything changed . Warhol 's influence becomes paramount ; his " hapless " mode becomes crucial . Hapless actually means " unfortunate , " but I think of it as referring to an image without obvious affect . Only the neutrality of the sitter and artist come through , although this hardly obviates a signature style . Recording is the point . And making categories : think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the little match girl peering in at high society , wondering what a rich collector or a countess was like and creating a taxonomy of it . Unlike Picasso , he revealed very little of himself . LEON GOLUB Painter <p> When I came to New York in 1964 , there was a strong anti-Picasso mood . By the time the Modern did its retrospective in 1980 , everyone was mad about him . I felt that was the difference between the sons  --  the generation of Pollock and de Kooning  --  and the grandsons . By the time the grandsons came along , Picasso was out of contention ; they did n't have to struggle with him anymore . I do n't know if he has a lot of relevance for today 's painters and portraitists . He 's not really interested in portraiture so much as a kind of expanded self-representation . One or two of the figures in " Les Demoiselles d'Avignon " bear his features in distorted , symbolic form . Everybody knows that the bull in " Guernica " is Picasso himself . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to empower himself . <p>
