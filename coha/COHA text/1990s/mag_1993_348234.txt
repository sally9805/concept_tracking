THE FACE WAS FAMILIAR . VIRGINIA SKEENS , A resident of a rural section of Wayne County , Michigan , watched as a man she had seen on the evening news unloaded his paraphernalia at the home of her neighbor Jack Miller , 53 , a tree trimmer who suffered from terminal bone cancer . " I knew , " she later told reporters , " somebody was going to die . " <P> And someone did . Facing a March 30 state deadline specifically enacted to end his practice of medically assisting suicides , Dr. Jack Kevorkian and two helpers assembled the machinery that allowed Miller to do himself in . But this ninth " medicide " since 1990 offered some new twists : Miller was the first male to die and the first outside Kevorkian 's former home territory of Oakland County . The message , said his attorney , was that Kevorkian would not only defy the impending Michigan ban but continue to expand his practice throughout the state to include anyone , anywhere , anytime .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
