This collection of interviews with inhabitants of the sexual fringe reads like an odd combination of a reporter 's raw files and an undergraduate 's paper . The strength here is that the author does dig up unquestionably fascinating subjects : vampires who drink one another 's blood , necrophiliac morticians , people who claim to have been abducted and sexually molested by aliens , a married surgeon who sleeps with 10 women a month . But her writing style can be monotonous and self-conscious , and her need to place these people in cultural context and blame society for their freakish proclivities is trite . Still , the book is worth skimming  --  you 'll feel contentedly average afterward . <P>  --  By Joel Stein
