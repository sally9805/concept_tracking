<p> The Harris County attorney 's office is investigating allegations that County Judge Jon Lindsay accepted more than $ 100,000 in bribes in the mid-1980s to change the route of a major north Harris County thoroughfare . <p> Billy Wayne Chester , a former Houston banker and real estate developer , said in an interview with the Houston Chronicle that he gave Lindsay $ 75,000 in January 1985 and an additional $ 30,000 in gambling money during a trip to Las Vegas a few months later . <p> Chester , who pleaded guilty to two counts of bank fraud earlier this year , has also made the allegations to federal and county authorities . He was sentenced Monday to five years probation on the federal charges and ordered to pay more than $ 9.5 million in restitution . <p> Chester claims the cash payments were in return for Lindsay 's decision to alter the route of Cypresswood Drive through Park 45 , a real estate development located off the Hardy Toll Road in north Harris County . Chester owned the property jointly with developer Robert Corson , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and his partner took Lindsay on several all-expense-paid trips to Las Vegas and Mexico , and cut him into a no-investment , no-risk real estate deal that netted the county judge more than $ 7,000 in additional payments . <p> County Attorney Mike Driscoll confirmed Monday his office is investigating the allegations but would not discuss details of the probe . <p> Assistant County Attorney Terry O'Rourke , however , said that if the allegations are found to have merit , the county attorney 's office will file a lawsuit seeking Lindsay 's removal from office . <p> Lindsay said the payoff allegations are " " simply not true . " The judge said the Cypresswood changes were made to improve access to the toll road and save county taxpayers money . He also said he was unaware that Corson owned the property at the time " " the deal was done . " <p> Lindsay indicated that Chester 's allegations were motivated by a desire to get a lighter federal sentence . <p> " " Other than his problems with the federal courts , why he is doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " " If he 's trying to save his own neck in some way , well , I guess that 's what he 's trying to do . " <p> In 1991 , Chester , along with Corson and B.J. Garman , were indicted on charges of obtaining or profiting from more than $ 9 million in fraudulent loans through Vision Banc Savings Association of Kingsville . Garman , Corson 's mother , is a fugitive from justice . <p> Corson , former owner of Vision Bank Savings , was found dead last year in an El Paso motel while awaiting trial . According to an El Paso County coroner 's report , he died of natural causes . <p> Chester told the Chronicle on Monday that his plea agreement with federal authorities requires him to disclose every criminal act he has committed and every criminal act he is aware of . For more than six years , Chester said , he kept quiet . Upon agreeing to cooperate with the FBI , he said , it was finally time to " " come clean " about his past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off my chest and get on with my life , " Chester said . <p> Richard " " Racehorse " Haynes , Chester 's attorney , confirmed that his client told federal authorities about the payments as part of his plea agreement . <p> " " He was asked by federal officials to tell him all he knew about Park 45 , and he did , " Haynes said . <p> Haynes said that before he took the case Chester submitted to a lie detector test , and that his account of making cash payments was found to be truthful . <p> " " We wanted to be sure we were not being sold a bill of goods , " Haynes said . <p> U.S. Attorney Larry Finder acknowledged that Chester has met with federal authorities and was " " debriefed " on numerous matters , but he declined to provide details of Chester 's cooperation . <p> " " I can not go into what type of information he has given us , " Finder said . <p> Harris County District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr . said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County Attorney 's office was investigating until contacted by the Chronicle . <p> He said , however , that the three-year statute of limitations on bribery has long since passed and his office could not file criminal charges against Lindsay , even if the allegations prove true . <p> The statute of limitations would not bar a civil action to remove Lindsay from office . <p> A six-month Chronicle investigation into the allegations has revealed that Lindsay was personally responsible for rerouting Cypresswood through Park 45 and pushed the change through Harris County Commissioners Court despite heated objections by then-Commissioner E.A. " " Squatty " Lyons , who represented the precinct in which the route changes occurred . <p> County engineers originally planned to build a bridge at the intersection of Cypresswood and the Hardy Toll Road , and made the plans part of a bond proposal during the early 1980s . <p> County records show , however , that Lindsay recommended in February 1985 that plans for the Cypresswood bridge be abandoned . <p> He said that traffic flow would not warrant a new bridge until the next century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cypresswood to Lexington Boulevard , which would route across an existing bridge and back to Cypresswood via Aldine Westfield Road , a change Lindsay claimed would save taxpayers $ 2.3 million . <p> That new thoroughfare  --  later named Cypresswood North Loop  --  cut through Chester and Corson 's proposed Park 45 development . <p> The 220-acre tract of land was owned by General Homes at the time , but Chester and Corson had signed a contract to purchase the property at the time the route change occurred . <p> Chester said his partner wanted the new thoroughfare to run through the Park 45 development to enhance the property 's value , and Corson agreed to pay Lindsay $ 75,000 in cash to see that the route change was made . Chester said he and Corson later paid Lindsay more than an additional $ 30,000 for his cooperation on the route change . <p> Chester told the Chronicle he personally delivered the cash  --  packed in a briefcase  --  to Lindsay several weeks before the county judge publicly announced the changes . The payoff was made in the parking lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " " I met him in there , we had a couple of drinks , we went out to the car , he got the money out of the briefcase and put it in a sack , walked over and put it in his car , " Chester said . " " I went inside and called Robert and told him everything 's done and Robert joined us 30 to 45 minutes later . <p> " " We sat there , had a few drinks and Judge Lindsay went home . " <p> County documents show that Lindsay pushed the change through Commissioners Court despite objections by then-Commissioner Lyons . <p> In a heated exchange between the two men , Lyons accused Lindsay of developing the route change in " " clandestine meetings " and going back on a promise made to county residents during a bond election that the Cypresswood bridge would be built . " " I do n't know of any more arrogant moves by any official on the Commissioners Court in the history of this county than this right here , " Lyons said during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commissioners eventually approved Lindsay 's proposal . <p> After the Cypresswood Loop North was built , the county decided to proceed with construction of the Cypresswood bridge , despite Lindsay 's earlier claims that the bridge was unnecessary . <p> Chester said Corson sold the Park 45 development and netted more than $ 4.5 million in profits . <p> Lindsay told the Chronicle on Monday that the county negotiated with General Homes over the route of Cypresswood North Loop , and that he did not know Corson and Chester were the developers of the Park 45 property . <p> " " I did n't know they had it under contract , " Lindsay said . <p> In addition to making the $ 75,000 cash payment to Lindsay , Chester claims Corson frequently entertained Lindsay , including taking him on a hunting trip to Mexico in January 1985 and to Las Vegas later that year . <p> On the Las Vegas trip , Chester said Corson instructed him to give Lindsay $ 30,000 in cash to gamble with . <p> Lindsay acknowledged that he went on trips at Corson 's invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Lindsay also denied having any business relationship with Corson . <p> Chester , however , also claims that Lindsay was given a profit participation in a 3-acre tract of land on FM 521 in west Harris County  --  a deal that Chester claims made Lindsay more than $ 7,000 in profits with no investment and no risk in the real estate deal . <p> Chester also provided the Chronicle with a copy of an agreement purportedly signed by Lindsay and Corson in which terms of the real estate deal are spelled out . The agreement states that Lindsay 's " " sole obligation " was to receive 5 percent of the net profit from the sale of the property . <p> The agreement is dated September 1985 , the same month Commissioners Court gave final approval to the Cypresswood route change . <p> Lindsay said he does not remember signing the agreement but did recall that Corson talked to him at one time about joining him in a land deal in that area . <p> " " We talked about participating on something they did , but I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-1980s , Corson was a major political supporter of Lindsay 's re-election efforts . Campaign records show Corson contributed $ 10,000 to Lindsay 's campaign in early 1986 . Lindsay has also acknowledged that Corson hosted a campaign fund-raiser in his home for Lindsay during the 1986 campaign .
