In 1977 President Jimmy Carter gave a speech renouncing America 's " inordinate fear of communism . " This line came to haunt Carter and established his reputation for global naivete . It is often contrasted with President Ronald Reagan 's " evil empire " speech of 1983 , although the two phrases are not logically contradictory . Carter did n't say inordinate moral revulsion from communism or inordinate military opposition to the Soviets . He said " fear , " meaning an inordinate belief in the power of communism as a political and economic system . <P> ) And has n't history borne him out ? Even after six years of remarkable change , the fragility of communism after the August coup attempt surprised nearly everyone . Meanwhile in Washington , the hearings on Robert Gates for CIA director exposed the mechanisms that produced inordinate fear . <P> Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has developed a magnificent obsession with the CIA 's odd role in the cold war as a cheerleader for the success of the Soviet experiment . " Every President since Dwight Eisenhower has been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates vastly in excess of ours , " he says . The CIA regularly predicted that the Soviets were catching up . In the late 1970s , it claimed , absurdly in retrospect , that the Soviet economy was two-thirds the size of America 's . While exaggerating the importance of communist regimes in such places as Angola and Nicaragua , the agency also completely missed the ethnic and nationalist time bombs inside the Soviet Union itself . <P> At the Gates hearings Senators struggled to determine the nominee 's role in past CIA enterprises and whether he was acting out of principled belief or narrow ambition . Whatever your conclusion on those issues , the hearings revealed the CIA in the 1980s as an institution determined to portray Soviet communism as an ever growing threat , no matter what the evidence . The agency produced an intentionally one-sided report on possible Soviet involvement in the assassination attempt on the Pope and presented it as a balanced view  --  in support of Director William Casey 's conviction that the Soviets were behind all international terror . It offered retrospective justification for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were making inroads in Iran  --  something that even Gates now admits was incorrect . <P> The argument between liberals and conservatives about what caused communism 's fall and who got it right or wrong will go on for a long time . On the main cause  --  the utter hopelessness of communism as an economic system  --  both sides got it right in their hearts but somehow wrong in their heads . They knew communism could n't work but forgot it . Of the two sides of the argument , though , it seems to me that conservatives were wronger here . They are the ones who kept emphasizing that military strength could grow indefinitely , no matter how decrepit the economy .
