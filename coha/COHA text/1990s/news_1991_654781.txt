<p> IF Saddam Hussein is facing his moment of truth , President Bush is confronting in the Middle East the defining moment of his presidency . <p> That the battle against tyranny is being won is now incontestable . The way things have been going on the battlefield should have sobered many doubters . What will come after the guns fall silent , however , is the real challenge . At the center of this challenge is the Palestine problem . <p> Now that the war has been going on for a month , the controversy over linkage or no linkage has become meaningless . The practical , cynical linkage has been nailed . <p> Not so the moral linkage . The cynicism with which an inherently just cause was , and is , still being manipulated does not make it less just or less urgent . Few causes have been as blatantly exploited to serve the narrow interests of some groups or rulers as the Palestinian issue . <p> Nevertheless , few disinterested people could now deny that among all the Middle East 's problems this issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue readily intertwines with and complicates all other problems in the region . How much more at ease we could all feel had we worked in a more sustained manner to resolve a problem that has been with us for some 43 years . <p> The nightmares that many experience when Saddam 's largely " political " missiles , as President Mubarak described them , are fired at Israel should go a long way toward making people rethink their reluctance to give the Palestinian cause the priority it deserves . <p> Paradoxically , the Gulf war presents us with an unprecedented opportunity . The indivisibility of the security of the region has become apparent . Few states , within or outside the area , can claim they have no stake in the resolution of the Palestine problem . <p> Still more significant is the change in attitude of the Arab Gulf states , which in the past had reckoned they need not be involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict beyond extending financial assistance to Palestinians . <p> It is hardly a secret among Washington policymakers that some of these oil-rich states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab-Israeli conflict , recently made it clear to visiting Americans that they would now accept full normalization of relations with Israel - provided it takes place within an overall solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict . At the root of that conflict , they firmly believe , is the Palestinian problem . <p> Since Israel has recently insisted on establishing peaceful relations with its neighboring Arab states as a precondition for settling its dispute with the Palestinians , this new development in the attitude of the Gulf countries is of critical importance . <p> In this context , a properly structured international conference should be convened . And the appropriate time is soon after the Gulf war ends . <p> Only in such a venue can we resolve all the complex issues related to the solution of the Palestinian problem , the normalization of relations among all states of the region , and the formulation of security arrangements needed to rid the region of all weapons of mass destruction . <p> All these issues require the involvement of the big powers , not to impose their will but rather to mediate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the economic aid without which the mammoth task of reconstruction will be impossible . <p> The United States has never been in such a strong position as it is now to play the principal role in this process . Washington has been the linchpin of the gigantic international operation in the Gulf since the eruption of the present crisis . US leverage both with the Arab Gulf states and with Israel , now under the protective shield of its Patriot missiles while receiving increased financial assistance , has been vastly strengthened . <p> For the first time , the blood of American young men and women is being spilled in defense of those who have regarded each other as enemies . <p> In addition , few previous American presidents have had such a grasp of international affairs as Mr. Bush . Few other presidents have had such a worldwide vision , accompanied by a determination to see that vision realized . <p> It is true that the attitudes of the two main protagonists of the Middle East tragedy , Israel and the Palestinians , seem to have hardened as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to argue that we should wait until their attitudes soften would be a recipe for disaster - as was the old argument that the US could not do much so long as the two parties remained unwilling to compromise . <p> Such an argument is bound to be considered in the Arab world as simply a variation on an old and failed theme . <p> Mainstream Palestinians have shown that they can compromise when offered hope . It is inconceivable that they would not compromise again if they are allowed to see a light at the end of the tunnel . If Washington does not act now , most of the region may enter a dark tunnel with no end in sight . <p> It should not be difficult for the United States to persuade Israel that its security is best found within guaranteed borders shared with neighbors who will join it in gradually moving , through normalized relations , toward a new order in the region and the world . <p> The present outburst of frustrations and confused emotions in some Arab and Muslim countries , though mostly fueled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense a cry for long overdue justice . <p> The situation is likely to take a downward turn if a firm commitment for action is not forthcoming from the highest level in Washington before the impending bloody ground war begins . <p> We will certainly face an unpredictable situation if a political vacuum follows the war , with its visible destruction , its destabilization of a country as central to the region 's balance of power as Iraq , and its humiliation of the proud Iraqi people . <p> Furthermore , moderate regimes in the region will feel let down if , after their courageous and principled stand against Saddam , they 're given no assurance of action on the Palestine problem - a problem now recharged with explosive emotions . <p> What is needed is a solemn declaration from President Bush to ensure for the Palestinians the same rights that President Woodrow Wilson promised for colonized peoples during World War I when he acknowledged the right of every people to chose their own allegiance and be free of masters . <p> It is to be hoped that President Bush will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Israelis and the Palestinians before they preempt him - and before other parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict relapse into their old , dangerous posturing.
