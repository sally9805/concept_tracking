THE COLOSSUS OF AMAGER <p> Weather and the World <p> Reading a book is n't a small task . The reader  --  that 's you  --  has a right to know what he or she can expect . It wo n't be much , I must confess , so maybe it wo n't be worth the trouble . Anyway , this story is about things just as they were and just as they happened . I ca n't change that . Sorry . <p> " In such critical times for our country as these " ( as the late Prime Minister Stauning would say ) , there are so many people writing books that no one  --  not even the most die-hard book addict  --  can manage to read everything . And there are a lot of other ways to use our spare time . Why not run out into the sun ? Why not go sledding ? Why not eat licorice while watching a good movie on TV ? <p> People should read only when they feel like it . Who does n't love TV ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . If you 've picked up this book but would actually prefer to be doing something else or " have more important things to do , " as we grown-ups say , then do it . Do that something else . Watch your movie . Because you 're going to have to concentrate here , and this story can hardly be called breathtakingly exciting . You will hear about my father 's constipation and why my name is Oscar . I think this is enormously interesting . But maybe you wo n't . I 'll be the first to admit that there 's more action in a gangster movie . <p> The book wo n't run away . Maybe it is n't that important . It 's just stories about my father and me from a long time ago . The sun and the snow outside your window , on the other hand , are here for today only , right here and now . This sun and this snow in any event . So use the weather . That 's what lends color to our days . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you get old , you can sit down and write about the weather and the world back when you were a child . That 's what my book is about , the weather and the world , but especially about my father and me . <p> We 'll begin on a good day . <p> About My Father 's Good Days <p> " Pretty soon I ' 11 have so damn many wrinkles I ' 11 have to screw my hat on ! " <p> That 's what my father would say sometimes , and we would howl even though we had heard it hundreds of times before . For it was a sign that he was in a good mood , and that did n't happen very often . Very rarely in fact , if the truth be told . Another of his favorite jokes was a kind of a riddle . He would ask : " Do you know what a belch is , my boy ? " <p> " No , Dad , " I would say , waiting for the answer , which of course I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver . <p> It went : " A belch is a noise progressing up from the stomach over the tongue that tells people that your asshole is jammed shut ! " <p> That was my father on his good days . He knew a lot about wrinkles and belches . He had too many wrinkles . His forehead was practically threaded , so the joke about the hat was obvious enough . On the other hand , he suffered from low pressure in his stomach and usually went around complaining because he could n't belch . On that rare occasion when he succeeded in burping , he thanked the heavenly powers and meant it sincerely . He thanked God for a good belch . My father did n't make great demands of life . He just wanted to feel all right . He hardly ever did , though . <p> He suffered from so many things . First of all , there was the really important matter of his kidneys , but we 'll get to that . The business with his kidneys was virtually a fact of life for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly . But what he could n't cope with were all the minor ailments . He suffered from constipation . He suffered from insomnia . He suffered from migraines or something similar . In any event , he always had a headache . The condition did n't exist that my father did n't suffer from . He was a greatly tormented man . <p> I visualize him sitting on the toilet in the middle of the night , wide awake and waiting for a miracle . A belch , a fart , or  --  if his prayers really were heard in the great beyond  --  a turd . He is reading a newspaper or a magazine in order not to be bored as he clutches his head and complains . Squeezing his temples to ease the pressure a little . Trying to squeeze his stomach to increase the pressure there . <p> Meanwhile he whispers over and over : " Oh , Jesus Jesus Jesus . Why me of all people ? " He squeezes and squeezes for almost an hour . If he 's lucky , maybe a single tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to bed , to lie awake as the light appears outside and the sounds of the day begin . <p> My father stubbornly insisted that he never slept at night . That might have been something of an exaggeration , but it was n't wrong by much . He slept twelve hours on the average , I believe  --  not per day , but per week . And there was always the business about pressure . High pressure or low pressure , but never intermediate pressure , where things are just right and run smoothly . I said before that my father was a greatly tormented man . And he was too , but I have found a better word : he was a very pressured man . <p> Anyway , about two or three times a month . the completely unique , absolutely fantastic , and certainly heaven sent event occurred : he felt good . You have to have lived in that atmosphere in order fully to understand what an incredible relief it was when there was a smile , a tired joke , or just an impromptu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marvelous . We howled with laughter . We went around humming . We enjoyed each other 's company , my father and mother and I. Perhaps the next day would be another trek through the vale of woe , but on my father 's good days , the family rose to the occasion . We smiled as if we were being paid for it . They could have taken pictures of us for the papers , and people would have envied us . " Now there 's a nice family , " they would have said in all the other tormented and pressured families . <p> About the Others in the Family <p> Evil tongues in the family  --  and there were a lot of them , because my father came from one of the old-fashioned provincial families where they upheld the " more-the-merrier " principle and called themselves a clan or a pedigreed line  --  accused my father of making things worse than they were . Of faking it , as the saying goes , of playing sick . Both my Uncle Jonas and my paternal Aunt Oda  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little sister , who visited us constantly  --  were always telling him that , by God , he 'd better pull himself together and see about getting up and at ' em . <p> There was a world beyond Kastrup too , as they said , and if the idea of the world sounded too drastic , well , then he might start by taking a walk in , for example , Kastrup . Out on the street in the world in real life , which in actual fact he did n't see an awful lot of since he was always lying in his bed complaining . My father gave a scornful laugh at that and looked up at the ceiling . " Poor fools , " he must have been thinking . " They talk about as well as their brains work . " <p> Since then I 've thought about whether they actually were right . Back then , I always sided automatically with my father . In the first place because he was my father , after all . In the second place because all three of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Oda and whatever else all the rest of them were called . Of course they were n't entirely wrong . My father was simply always lying in that bed . He knew the world only from the news on the radio , which he complained about at that . <p> " I get enough news in the weather forecast , " was his running commentary on the international situation , which was as always tense . Back then there were problems in the Middle East . There are problems there today too . It 's very possible that the times will change but there will always be problems in the Middle East . <p> I 've thought about it a lot and have come to the conclusion that Jonas and Oda were right , even though they really were very irritating and invited themselves to dinner every Sunday , which we definitely could not afford in the so-called long run because only my mother was earning money . No doubt about it , my father would have been better off taking a few walks , getting out of his circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and bathroom , thinking about something else and forgetting himself . Still , it must be remembered that he was clearly a man in pain . It was only on his good days that his eyes could see past himself and the boundaries of his pain . I certainly understand that he got tired of it . I understand even better that he got angry . <p> It 's entirely possible that my father was a hypochondriac , but by God he did die of it in the end . That got them , all right , the others in the family . <p> About the Older and the Younger <p> The place where we lived back then looked out over a lawn . Not because it was out in the country . We had two rooms plus a kitchen and bath in an unpretentiously ramshackle postwar apartment building . A fifties slum from an age of frugality . My father and mother had shouted for joy when they were offered the apartment . They would have shouted for joy about a hole in the ground . Back then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gave you a roof over your head . That ' s one of the reasons why the rest of us always have to hear about how good we actually have things , how happy we ought to be , how shoddy and lackadaisical everything has gradually gotten to be . <p> Older people always entertain younger people with that kind of thing . It sure is n't like it was in my day . Nope , take when I was a child . You do n't have any idea about what it was like . And so on and so forth . And of course we do n't . We do n't have any idea about what it was like back then . We might see pictures of it , but pictures are just pictures . They can only register , perpetuate what the naked eye sees . They ca n't remember . They ca n't know . And that 's why the lack of understanding is mutual . Because older people do n't have any idea about how younger people feel now either . They look at pictures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good old days are good primarily because they 're over . What was hard always becomes easier when you get it at a distance . If you live long enough , it might even get to be fun someday too . I mean : fights you got mixed up in , unreasonable orientation runs you were subjected to as a Cub Scout , desperate camping trips and awkward parties where it was just plain awful and you were about ready to crawl into a hole from embarrassment . That 's the kind of thing we remember and call good times . The hottest summers and the coldest winters . <p> That 's why maybe it is wrong , the way I remember my father . That there were only totally good and totally bad days . But you ca n't go back , and now that 's the way it is . All the ordinary days and the things in between , which certainly existed as well  --  they 're gone . They 're forgotten . They 're just time and life that have passed . <p> So I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my story . <p> About My Father , Myself and Other Oddities <p> By the way , have I revealed that my name is Oscar ? All right , well it is . <p> Oscar with a c at that . I ca n't help it . The name was my father 's idea , of course . His own name was Birger , and he was proud of that name . My mother , whose name was Tove and who was a rational woman with a sense of the proper order and relation of things , was against it , obviously . She would have called me Kim , a completely ordinary and reliable boy 's name which was very much in vogue that year . <p> " You just ca n't call the poor kid Oscar . It 'll be hard on him . The other kids will laugh at him . He 'll hate you for that name . It 's even worse than Arthur or Brge or Max or Ejvind . Why not Kim ? Kim 's a good name . A fine name . Short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes . " <p> " I could n't care less about all that stuff ! He 's my son , and I want his name to be Oscar . Period ! If you want to christen him anything else , it will be without me , my dear ! " <p> My mother had both feet on the ground , but my father was always flying high . He was a man of sweeping gestures . When he was lying in bed , he passed the time by reading . Since he lay in bed a lot , the whole house was crammed with books because borrowing books from the library was n't enough for my father . He absolutely and positively had to own them . That was one of the things that my parents were always getting into arguments about . My father would rather have books than food . My mother had to devise every possible precaution and hide her money all over so he would n't use it on books . But that 's another story . <p> One author in whom he took more than ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His other favorite had the first name of Percy , and I ( who lay kicking in my cradle and was n't consulted ) absolutely had to be called one of those things . My mother would n't hear of Percy at all ( I owe her a great debt ) , so she had to live with my being christened Oscar Olsen . She turned out to be entirely right in her predictions , by the way . The other kids at school shrieked with laughter when they heard what my name was . Oscar Olsen . It was many years before I was able to see the humor in the combination myself . But there was nothing to be done . My father was already an expert in staying away from family get-togethers  --  something that the clan considered nothing less than sacred  --  and if I had n't been called Oscar , he certainly would have stayed home from the baptism . That would have been just like him . I do n't call him the Colossus for nothing . He was sublimely indifferent to other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oscar it was , and Oscar I am : an itinerant monument to a man who died in the year 1900 . I 've never read a line of this man 's works . The name will have to suffice . <p> About My Father 's Yearning for Faraway Places <p> As a completely normal lunatic in an insane family , I must say that nothing was more disconcerting than my father in the role of an ordinary father of a family . It was truly a trial . Once a year , on one of his good days of course , the devil got into him and transformed him into a completely different person . A restless person . An adventurer . A man with a zest for life . Of all his oddities , this was definitely the most peculiar . <p> He simply could not sit still . Gone were his aches ; forgotten was the constant pain in his stomach . Whoosh  --  gone . Now we were supposed to celebrate the fact that we existed . To someone accustomed to my father bedridden , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tables and chairs , the transformation came as no small shock . It usually happened in the summertime , when he got the song of birds in his heart , and the trees outside became so green that they hurt your eyes and called to you . Then my father was dressed by eight o'clock and ready to conquer to world . <p> ' To the sea ! To the sea , I say , and it ca n't happen fast enough ! I have a yearning for faraway places . I 'm burning up in here . I need billowing waves and blue sky . Oscar and Tove , pack your things ! " <p> My mother and I did as the Colossus commanded and packed beach clothes , lunch , and whatever else one takes along . We did n't really know what we ought to think about the phenomenon . My mother was always afraid that he would fall and hurt himself because he was n't used to moving around in the open . Furthermore , in his confinement he had developed manners that , to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anything irritated him , he made it known immediately : " Now pull yourself together , man , and try to show you 've got a few brains ! Do n't just stand there and gawk like a cow ! Why , I 'm lying here languishing away , you ninny ! " <p> And so forth . We were used to hearing it but could imagine how the day would go if my father started telling other people at the beach what he thought of their looks and what they could do with their moldy coffee cups and stinking bathing togs . <p> " Up yours , I say . Up yours ! " <p> " Sh , Birger , not so loud . Wo n't you please stop ? " <p> " I 'll be dimmity damned if I will ! It 's my beach too , I 'll have you know . Who do those idiots think they are ? Damn rudeness ! We should have stayed at home . We should have . " <p> But it was n't until later in the afternoon that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was full of love for his fellow man . There were no limits to how wonderful the world really was . <p> " Did you see that , Tove , huh ? Look at that little bird over there ! And look at that old man with his dog there ! Look at how its tail is wagging ! Look at how the sun is shining . Is this a great day or what , huh ? Yes , I just ask you : Is n't this a thoroughly fabulous day ? " <p> " Oh yes , yes , dear . Now take it easy . We 'll go swimming now and lie in the sun . " <p> " That 's what I mean : Is n't this a great day ? " <p> " Oh yes , yes dear , it certainly is . " <p> My mother 's patience was boundless . They ought to put up a statue of that woman . For my part , I had had enough of the joys of life by the time noon rolled around . When it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly monotonous . There was at least some variety to his cursing and complaining . Here he had many years of training and could improvise ad infinitum . Aside from everything else , it was fun to hear my father cursing things . <p> He was astonishingly athletic . When we reached the water ( and as far as water for swimming goes , Amager Beach is at the top of the list ) , he was out of his clothes in a flash and threw himself headfirst into the Bresund without hesitating . The slightly rotten bathing jetty rumbled ominously as he went running down it , but the dive itself was about the finest thing I 've ever seen . His body split the water like an arrow . His head disappeared for a moment ( my mother held her breath ) , but then up it came , small and wet , a short distance away in the blue-green water . <p> " Well , come on , you cowards ! The water is n't poisonous . It wo n't kill you . " <p> " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then my high-pitched boy 's voice . The wind carried my words out to him . They may still be hanging there . <p> Then we dived down to him , my mother in an antique bathing suit that was faded , and I in Tarzan trunks that were much too large and slipped down whenever they got wet . My father opened his arms and we glided into them , one under each arm . Then all three of us laughed and forgot about everything else . His teeth were yellow in the sunlight . His hair was turning gray . My mother winked at me . We squeezed close to each other . <p> If I live to be a hundred and nothing at all interesting happens from now on , I will still say that it was all worth it and more . I 'm thankful for those days . I 'm thankful for my father 's yearning for faraway places . Being with him on a day like that was n't just unusual , it was an adventure . It was something you never forget . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house was located near the airport , and the place was a peculiar blend of rural and urban . Before the airplanes , it had been a small city outside the city , complete with a town hall and everything . After the arrival of the planes , the town became a kind of entry ramp to the capital city . A whole lot of people moved in who worked in the city ; they arrived more or less at the same time as the airplanes . That ' s why the place did n't have any history . Of course there were a few survivors from before who could remember a whole lot about how it was before the planes . But there was n't anybody who wanted to listen to it . For most of the new people , history began with the establishment of the airport . They did n't have any use for the past here . <p> The name of the place was Kastrup , and in many ways it resembled those little model towns that you build for your electric train . There was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but facades and roofs . It was difficult to picture people living in these blocks of red and yellow brick . If you were just driving through  --  which is what most people did  --  the natives resembled extras in a depressing movie . Kastrup is n't a place you feel like stopping in and exploring . You hurry on and out of it . You can ' blame anybody for that . <p> Of course , it was different for those of us who , as a sheer matter of fact , lived in those houses and knew that they contained all of those incredibly many destinies . Not only that . Beneath the buildings there were long , low cellars that you could get lost in . Above the apartments were attics with sloping ceilings where you could build caves and play monster movie . Then , too , there was the yard behind our apartment building where there was grass , bushes , and garages . You could barricade yourself in these thickets . You could play soccer ( which of course you were n't allowed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was the eternal fuss with senile , spiteful residents who saw it as their mission in life to make sure that this prohibition was observed ) . You could perform complete historical reenactments , such as the American Civil War , D-Day , the Battle of Little Bighorn , and the Charge of the Light Brigade . Waterloo is located in Kastrup , as my father used to say . He followed our games closely . He gave us good ideas . Unlike other fathers , he was always home during the day . My friends loved him , even though they thought he was a little strange . He was , of course . That 's the reason he was the Colossus . <p> We named him after the Colossus of Rhodes , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World . The Colossus of Rhodes was a gigantic statue that stood straddling the entrance to a harbor and towered all the way up to the sky . My father always stood on the balcony when he came out and gave us good advice . The Colossus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amager . <p> A lot can be said about the building we lived in . It certainly was n't attractive . It was really the pits , if the truth be told . The airplanes made constant noise , and the street traffic never stopped . Still , it was a good place to be a child . Really . It may be that stone pavements and farms have their charm ( even though it smells in the country , and the back lots are overflowing with trash ) , but in Kastrup we had the best of both worlds . Of course , later on you move because it is n't much fun to live in a model town that is missing its electric train , but growing up as a kid in Kastrup is not a bad thing . <p> In an odd way , it was almost always completely quiet there . The noise of the planes had settled itself so completely in the backs of our heads that we did n't notice it anymore . When my father was sick  --  which he almost always was  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  the silence was so great that you could hear the world hum . I went around in the living room puttering with things . Cutting figures out of oatmeal boxes and looking out at the wide sky . Sometimes I think that the silence ate its way farther in than I knew . Later on , the world always seemed to me to be unusually noisy . Bombs and automobile horns . Children 's screams . High-pitched squealing and church bells . Wailing sirens and drunks singing in the middle of the night . It makes you jumpy all the time . You walk around afraid . A little more consideration could certainly be shown to the children of silence . <p> When it was winter and there was snow , it was pretty fantastic to look out at the world . When the view really blurred up , you could hardly tell the difference between the sky and the ground . They were one , as they say . The sky was white , and the ground was white , and the buildings were white . The snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the shelter of the long garage , plants and bushes were hidden from view . <p> Close to Christmas , you could almost hear the songs . " Ring Ye Bells . " " A Child Is Born . " " It 's Cold Outside " ( which it obviously was , but back then you were properly dressed , and your hands got hot in those knitted mittens and you got damp frost on your stocking cap , so you started to sweat by the time you had to go back inside ) . It was a white and silent winter world . It was as pretty as a picture postcard and more . When those choirs started to sing in your head , it was n't just pretty . It was beautiful . <p> About the Great Battle <p> That was one version of winter in Kastrup : me pressing my nose flat against the patterns of frost on the window pane while my mother is slaving away to bring money home and my father is lying in the bedroom . Another version took place out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartments had lots of children , girls and boys , and when it was winter , we turned to snow on the inside . I 'm not lying . No sooner had we come home from school , where the light was yellow and friendly in the morning while the teacher talked sleepily to deaf ears ( later in the day though , the light lost its warm quality ) , than we rushed out to the Great Battle . <p> The Great Battle raged constantly over the course of the winter . We were two small armies , each with our own territory and snow fort . The boundary ran through the middle of the yard , where the clothesline was strung on its little asphalt rectangle . That was No Man 's Land , an area we were endlessly fighting back and forth over , conquering and losing it , capturing and being driven from it . We lived for the Great Battle . We built up huge stockpiles of snowballs . We screamed battle cries with thin voices that were made even smaller by the snow , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We launched assaults . We attacked . We defended . We held our ground . The ultimate humiliation , of course , occurred when the enemy captured our fort . It happened once in a while . And that was too bad because then the game was over , and we had to start all over again . So we did . There was plenty of snow to go around . <p> Once in a while , when you marvel at what makes fully grown and ostensibly rational people wage war against one another , build up stockpiles of weapons that can wipe out the world twelve times or more , and on the whole act in a way so that anybody with eyes in his head can see that this is the way to oblivion , you have to remember winter and the Great Battle in the yard behind the apartment building . Then you can be nice and decent and make excuses for yourself . Because of course they were n't real weapons , and no worlds were destroyed . As I said , there was plenty of snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we had had some lethal weapon or other up our sleeve , we might have taken it into our heads to throw it . You never know . People do so many things in the heat of battle , and we certainly are n't any better than the old men who rule the world . <p> This world would certainly look different if the Americans and the Russians and all the rest had only snowballs to play with . And imagine if it were Christmas every day , with Peace on Earth in an eternal armistice . Starlight and quiet calm . Christmas hearts and delight . It would be cake . Instead we get " stones for bread , " whatever that might mean . But one thing is certain : the old men are n't playing with snow . They 're playing with death , and we wo n't have Peace on Earth until hell itself freezes over . <p> About the End of Life <p> That last expression , about hell freezing over , I got from the Colossus . He followed the Great Battle eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island , which he owned in three editions and read at least once a year . It was as if he never really grew up . He was n't cut out for Kastrup , where everything was tedious and painful and real . He ought to have lived in a boys ' book where you found treasures and went out in search of adventure and were never constipated . In his book he could turn to a new chapter when the plot bored him . He could n't do that in real life . You ca n't do that in real life . <p> I say that my father was the Colossus , and he was . But he was something else too . He was the boy who refused to surrender . He was the dream that was able to fly . He was Peter Pan in his heart . <p> He loved playing games , and he was good at them . He won at Monopoly . He won at chess . He won at cards . Every victory delighted him , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good loser to play against my father . He was ruthless in his strategy and enjoyed your defeat . We did n't begrudge him his victories . They were his only moments of glory . He never won anything in real life . <p> One day he got sick for real and died . It went very quickly , but it was n't painless . His kidneys , which he had complained about for years , stopped functioning the way they were supposed to . First he swelled up , then he shriveled up , then he disappeared . It took my mother much too long to have him admitted to the hospital , but it was n't her fault . In the first place , my father was scared stiff of doctors and everything about them . White coats gave him goose pimples . Hypodermic needles made him pass out . In the second place , he had been complaining for so long about how much he hurt that nobody really took it seriously until it was too late . He really did n't either . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the inside and could n't be saved . I wo n't try to describe what it felt like to lose him . One does not dwell on the annihilation of the world . <p> But he was good at dying : The Colossus 's last great performance was the end of his life . He became silent . He stopped complaining . He stopped cursing everything and everybody . Instead , he said wise things with a soft voice and looked at the world with a gentle gaze . In an odd way it was this end that he had been waiting for all those years . He had prepared himself thoroughly . He became the dignified man that he had always wanted to be but could never stomach for very long . Now he was playing his last role . He died as the Colossus . <p> I sat beside his bed during the final days and listened to his voice floating up to the ceiling like cigarette smoke as I thought about every different situation I had seen him in . I was listening to his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his childhood that he had told me before . Maybe I should have paid attention , but I was busy looking at him . <p> Outside , the sparrows were singing the fall in . We smiled at each other , tired and afraid , both of us . When my mother came home , there were three of us . It lasted until the middle of October , when the birds became silent too . Then he died , and we buried him , and it was over . <p> Look at that little bird over there . <p> About Not Smiling at the Enemy <p> The funeral was a great production , with rented meeting rooms and refreshments . Everyone shook hands and offered condolences . Neither my mother nor I said very much . People become quiet when their fathers die . <p> Uncle Jonas and Aunt Oda stood at the front of the ranks of mourners . They wrung their moist hands , and their voices broke . My mother smiled reservedly and thanked them . She had to do that for the sake of appearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile and turned away . One thing I had learned from the Colossus : you do n't smile at the enemy . <p> The Colossus of Amager <p> Even now , in my dreams so many years later , he raises his hand and calls . His voice is neither strong nor weak . It 's inside my head . In my dreams he is always living in the water and has become a giant , a sea god , a colossal , invulnerable conqueror . I can only kneel at this picture . I ca n't get it to go away . <p> Sometimes I ca n't distinguish my dreams from what 's happening in real life . Then I hear him behind me , very close to my ear . He pats me on the shoulder and says inside my head : " Why did you leave me , my boy ? Why did you leave me back then ? " <p> I ca n't answer . I do n't dare turn around . I am Oscar , and he 's the Colossus . If I turned around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't understand his question . I never left him . It was the other way around . He was the one who left me . <p> In my dreams I see him . His body is hard and brown , taut with glistening muscles . He has scales on his shoulders . He has seashells in his hair , which has grown long and gray . Fish are spraying out of his nose ; dolphins are coiling in his beard . He is enormous . My father . A voice throughout the morning now . Why did you leave me , my boy ? <p> Sitting in his bed with a pillow at his back and lost in a book . That 's the way I remember him . That 's the way I love him . The Colossus . That he was . With fat on his belly and rust in his beard . My father was the Colossus of Amager . How do you free yourself from these chains ? <p> I do n't know . Nobody knows .

He is the author of thirty-five books , among them thirteen volumes of poetry , five novels , eight essay collections , a biographical essay on Oscar Wilde , a children 's book . and two collections of short stores . In addition , he has translated works of T. S. Elite , Ernest Hemingway , Nathanael West , Leonard Cohen , Anthony Minghella , Derek Walcott , Lou Reed , and others into Danish and also serves as a critic and reviewer for a number of leading Danish periodicals , including the influential Weekendavisen . His most recent works are En krans til de faldne ( A Wreath for the Fallen , poems and lyrics , 1992 ) and Ind i det amerikanske ( Into the American , essays on American subjects , 1992 ) .

Jensen has done two Fulbright stints in the United States . one at Yale ( 1981-82 ) and one at the University of Minnesota  --  St. Paul(1988-89) . <p> Primarily a poet , Jensen is a contemporary example of what used to be known as " A Man of Letters , " a writer who has distinguished himself in many genres . As a poet , Jensen has been described as a stylist , much more a deep imagist than a confessional poet . His work is also intertextual , not only to poets like Dylan Thomas and T. S. Eliot but also to the work of rock lyricists . Jensen 's fiction is extremely varied : the following story , taken from one of his collections , is an example of the deceptive lightness of style via which he skirts sentimental pitfalls to give a moving portrait of a dysfunctional family that transcends conventional expectations . Published originally for children , the story has made its way-and rightly so-into his collected short fiction for adults . <p> Bo Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Summer , 1981 ) , I lobet af aret ( In the Course of the Year , 1983 ) , Kolossen pa Amager ( The Colossus of Amager , 1984 , stories ) , Sa vidt vi ved er himlen bia ( As Far as We Know the Sky is Blue . 1985 ) , Stojen af virkelghed he Noise of Reality , 1987 , stories ) , En afgrund af frihed ( An Abyss of Freedom , 1989 ) , and Pigen med de gronne ojne ( The Girl with the Green Eyes , 1989 ) .
