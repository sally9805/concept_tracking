<p> Mission determines strategy . The recent PBS series on the Civil War was flawed by a misperception held by many historians : that Union General George McClellan agreed with Lincoln 's mission of winning the war by destroying the Confederate Army . <p> By ascribing the military failures of the first two years of the war to McClellan 's timidity , the series absolved Lincoln of blame for horrendous military blunders . That made generals with the killer instinct  --  the North 's Grant and the South 's Lee  --  look all the better . <p> McClellan  --  " the Young Napoleon "  --  was surely cocky , insubordinate and cautious to a fault , but he did not lose great battles . In fact , after one of the yes-men Lincoln preferred as general was routed at Second Manassas , Little Mac was called upon to reorganize the defeated army and stop Lee 's invasion of the North . <p> At Antietam 's blood-reddened creek , McClellan stopped Lee and for the second time saved the Union from defeat . But for failing to then destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led to the defeat of the insecure Burnside at Fredericksburg and the incompetent Hooker at Chancellorsville . <p> Yet Lincoln was not wrong to fire his best and most tested general . Because their political goals were different , their military strategies could never be reconciled . <p> Lincoln 's goal was to win the war and thereby to crush any possibility of secession . McClellan 's goal was to deny victory to the South , and then to settle the war on the basis of " the Union as it was "  --  no secession , but with slavery permitted to continue in the South , which had been Lincoln 's platform . He infuriated Lincoln by putting out peace feelers during negotiations for prisoner exchanges that might have led to peaceful separation . <p> The mission of peace with or without union led to McClellan 's " slows " and permeated his strategy of fighting to compromise . The end of his war , and that of the Peace Democrats who nominated him to oppose Lincoln in 1864 , would be reconciliation with slavery or peaceful separation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear down a smaller enemy  --  was rooted in his mission : not to be forced to settle , but to win . The end of his war would be victory , union , the principle of majority rule  --  and as a moral and diplomatic means to that end , emancipation . <p> Mission determines strategy . That 's why McClellan fought not to lose and Lincoln fought to win . Without suggesting that the war to come in Iraq is as central to our identity as the Civil War , let us apply that principle to our union of armies massed in Saudi Arabia . <p> If the mission were merely to protect oil supplies and to get Saddam Hussein to withdraw from most of Kuwait , then our current strategy of economic blockade and military readiness would be consistent with that goal . <p> Such a McClellanesque mission  --  averting defeat , seeking to settle  --  is held by the Soviet Union and France , Iraq 's longtime pre-eminent arms suppliers . It permeates the seventh floor of our own State Department . The Primakov mission , clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formerly united front 's decision to refuse negotiation until the aggression is reversed . <p> If our mission , however , is to remove the danger of a power-crazed dictator , already the instigator of a million deaths , who is known to be in the process of developing nuclear missiles capable of destroying any city in the world  --  then containment would be prelude to a bloodletting disaster . Collective security would be dead . <p> Some find that nuclear danger alarmist , two or three years away , and insist " it ca n't happen here . " But with the onrush of available technology , the dictator 's demonstrated willingness to use weapons of mass destruction and our own lack of an anti-missile shield  --  prudent people conclude that it can happen here . Nuclear weaponry is a great superpower equalizer ; in the hands of a ruler undeterred by the certainty of retaliation , it shifts the balance of terror . <p> The cancer is about to metastasize and we hold the scalpel in our hand . The mission is to be decided on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not threaten us , our strategy should be to squeeze and settle ; if he does , we should strike to save millions of lives . <p> McClellan lives ; we hear his counsel of delay in Moscow , in Paris , in the seventh floor of our State Department . Does the man in the White House now sense the mission of protecting freedom in the future ? If so , the painful , disenthralling strategy becomes clear . Send for Grant .
