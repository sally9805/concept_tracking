In February 1902 , M. Knoedler and Company , Winslow Homer 's dealer in New York City , wrote to the artist in Prout 's Neck , Maine , asking for a description of The Gulf Stream ( frontispiece and Pl . I ) . ( frontispiece and Pl . I omitted ) The gallery was concerned that the painting 's subject might deter potential buyers and was hoping a few words from the artist might make it more palatable . What seemed most troubling was the lack of resolution of its implied story . What , those who saw The Gulf Stream wanted to know , ultimately happened to the man in the boat ? Homer replied to Knoedler with the mixture of gruffness and sarcasm that had become common for him by this time : You ask me for a full description of my picture of the " Gulf Stream . " I regret very much that I have painted a picture that requires any description .... You can tell those ladies that the unfortunate negro who is now so dazed &; parboiled , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever after live happily. ( 1 ) Homer 's reply makes it pointedly clear what his painting is not about . And it seems equally obvious that he was frustrated with his contemporaries ' insistence on treating his pictures as easily read stories with clear conclusions to their narratives . The Gulf Stream has continued to bother observers to the present day . Although it is unquestionably one of Homer 's best-known images , historians have been reluctant to assign it a prime place in his oeuvre . It has been called one of the " least plastically satisfying of Homer 's paintings " and faulted for its " illustrative deficiencies . " ( 2 ) It has even been deemed " poorly painted , harsh in color , melodramatically overstated and terribly derivative in both its symbolism and its structure . " ( 3 ) Although such judgments touch heavily on matters of aesthetics , the words illustrative and melodramatic also suggest that something in the painting 's content continues to be found wanting . By suspending the story at an almost unbearably tense moment and leaving the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative of The Gulf Stream away from the specific and towards the universal . Whether the man lives or dies becomes emblematic of the ever-present possibility of death that all of us must face . By 1899 Homer had investigated many ways of accomplishing this kind of narrative deflection in his works , but his goal was always the same : to transform familiar or easily read subjects into ones capable of conveying more serious and profound meanings . That Homer would be sensitive to the complex relationships between visual images and narratives ( whether written , spoken , or imagined ) is not surprising when one considers that he began his professional career as an illustrator working for Ballou 's Pictorial , Harper 's Weekly , and other magazines where pictures and texts were customarily linked. ( 4 ) But Homer 's experiences during the Civil War  --  direct and firsthand as an artist at the front  --  began to teach him ways to work beyond both traditional pictorial precedents and typical narrative structures . Although Homer did create a few conventional battle scenes , ( 5 ) he soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential modernity from previous wars , an art that expressed those qualities would have to be different as well . His first Civil War painting , The Sharpshooter of 1863 ( Pl . III ) , managed to be wholly unlike any usual depiction of the horrors ( or glories ) of battle . ( Pl . III omitted ) At the same time , it chillingly evoked the dangers particular to this war  --  namely the new and deadly role played by technology ( in this case , a rifle capable of hitting a distant target ) . Here we see an early example of Homer 's manipulation of narrative structure , for there is obviously a story at work here  --  the familiar one in which one enemy tries to inflict grievous hurt on the other . However , we are only allowed to glimpse one component of the story ; we can not see what the sharpshooter sees , or know at whom he is shooting ( an officer ? enlisted man ? young ? old ? ) . By limiting the focus to the single figure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewer 's access to additional elements of the story he heightened it thematically . The painting becomes not so much a record of a specific incident , but rather a broader statement of the consequences of war . In Defiance : Inviting a Shot Before Petersburg ( Pl . IV ) , another early Civil War painting , Homer depicts a similar event from an opposite point of view . ( Pl . IV omitted ) Here a foolhardy Confederate soldier has jumped to the top of a rampart to taunt the enemy ; the consequences of his daring are evident in the tiny puff of smoke in the distance , which tells us that a bullet is speeding toward him . This is but one of numerous instances throughout his work in which Homer used a variation of typical or usual points of view to deflect a straightforward narrative reading of a picture . In the years after the war , Homer turned his attention to subjects drawn from modern American life  --  such as croquet , tourist travel , leisure activities at seaside resorts , and schools . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that he felt these subjects could not be fully expressed in single images . On several occasions he created pictures that may initially suggest decipherable stories , but which in the end do not so easily yield their meanings . At first glance , The Morning Bell ( Pl . V ) seems to be simply a painting of young women on their way to their labors . ( Pl . V omitted ) On closer examination , however , we notice that the woman in the center is not only literally but also emotionally apart from the others . Through her dress and demeanor , Homer indicates that she is an outsider and not part of the same community represented by the compact group of other women . The small building in the background appears to be a schoolhouse , suggesting that she is the schoolmistress . In light of the fact that the American educational system underwent widespread changes in the years following the Civil War , and teachers increasingly came from outside local communities , The Morning Bell can be seen as an image about change and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonies of country life . Breezing Up ( Pl . VI ) , still one of Homer 's best-loved paintings , was much admired when it first went on exhibition in 1876 . ( Pl . VI omitted ) One of the work 's chief appeals lies in the way it so faithfully re-creates the experience of a pleasant day 's sail . A critic for the New York Tribune wrote on April 1 , 1876 : No eye that delights in salt water ; and in the sight at least of a sail-boat bounding over it ... but must admit that there is not a picture in this exhibition , nor can we remember when there has been a picture in any exhibition , that can be named along side of this . On the face of it , the canvas tells a very simple narrative , but behind the seemingly straightforward image lay some three years of work , suggesting that the artist had something more in mind . Examination with infrared reflectography ( see Pl . VII ) reveals that Breezing Up underwent many alterations : a fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seated in the bow ( where there is now an anchor ) ; in the distance there were two other boats in full sail , both also highly finished ; the tiller and rudder were in a different position ; and the tiller was originally held by the man , not the boy seated at the stern . Artistic considerations were no doubt in part responsible for these changes ( the deletion of the background vessels , for instance , serves to concentrate the viewer 's attention on the foreground boat ) . However , the key to understanding Breezing Up , and Homer 's alterations to it , lies in the date of its completion , 1876 , the year of America 's Centennial . Marking the first one hundred years of national existence , the Centennial was an occasion to look into America 's future as well as its past . One writer observed that Americans " are animated by a new hopefulness ... the nation is only in its childhood . " ( 6 ) Another wrote , " We are young , strong , inventive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole nation will feel refreshed and encouraged . " ( 7 ) Americans were not only acutely aware of how young their nation was but also of how far it had come in just one hundred years , and how far it promised to go in the future . Homer 's replacement of the boy in the bow with an anchor  --  the symbol of hope  --  and , especially , the transfer of the helm from the old man to the boy ( " whose bright eye evidently sees such enormous horizons " ) ( 8 ) transforms the canvas into a symbolic embodiment of the optimism of the Centennial . On many occasions Homer painted pictures in which the interactions between figures are interrupted , disrupted , or in some way made unclear . Sometimes he accomplished this by showing them looking at something that is not within the space of the picture itself , as in the striking Promenade on the Beach of 1880 ( Pl . VIII ) . ( Pl . VIII omitted ) One appreciative , but puzzled , critic observed : On the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such expressions in their faces as suggest romances . Mr. Homer probably painted this peculiar phase of nature the dark sky first , but he has made a poem of it by introducing these figures. ( 9 ) One wonders , quite naturally , just who these women are and what it is that they are gazing at so intently . The collector George Walter Vincent Smith apparently asked Homer precisely those questions , for the artist replied to him in a letter of March 3 , 1880 : My picture represents the Eastern shore at sunset . The long line from the girls is a shadow from the sun . The girls are " somebody in particular " &; I can vouch for their good moral character : They are looking at anything that you want to have them look at , but it must be something at sea &; a very proper &; appropriate object for girls to be interested in . The schooner is a Gloucester fisherman . Hoping this will make everything clear. ( 10 ) Of course , Homer 's rather sarcastic explanation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously knew that much of the effect of the picture depended on its enigmatic mood and its resistance to simple narrative interpretation , and so refused to answer Smith 's questions completely . More than one hundred years later , we are still left wondering . The unresolved content of Promenade on the Beach and its striking formal qualities indicate that Homer began to reshape his art about 1880 , a process that continued through his stay in Cullercoats , a small English fishing village on the North Sea , in 1881 and 1882 , and with his move to Prout 's Neck in 1883 , where he lived for the rest of his life . During this phase , as his biographers have emphasized , Homer 's art attained a new sense of the heroic and the timeless . The first fully expressed examples of this change are the paintings executed between 1884 and 1886 . The Fog Warning of 1885 ( Pl . II ) , one of a series of pictures depicting New England fishermen at work , indicates how the manipulation of narrative meaning had become almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . II omitted ) A lone fisherman has paused in his rowing as his dory crests a wave , and he looks off in the direction of the large sailing vessel on the horizon . A dark bank of fog , a " long and ominous cloud , " ( 11 ) obscures the lower portion of the slop The painting was apparently called Halibut Fishing ( or The Halibut Fisher ) when it was first exhibited , but Homer insisted that it be called The Fog Warning . As the latter title makes clear , the painting represents what was an all-too-common peril , namely the " constant danger , at all seasons of the year , of fishermen , while out in boats , losing sight of their vessels . " ( 12 ) Homer chose the crucial moment when the fisherman must decide which course to row if he is to reach his mother ship ; once the fog has enveloped him , he can only hold his course and hope that he has made the right choice . As he would do fourteen years later in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the outcome . From the 1890s until his death in 1910 , Homer worked primarily in oils , which he preferred for his most serious paintings done in the studio , and in watercolors , which he used almost exclusively on his travels in New York 's Adirondack Mountains , Canada , and the tropics . In these years Homer 's paintings attained an even greater gravity and seriousness and became increasingly tragic and visionary . Some measure of this change can be seen in The Signal of Distress ( Pl . XI ) , which Homer painted in 1890 , exhibited in 1891 , and then drastically revised between 1892 and 1896 . ( Pl . XI omitted ) When it was exhibited in 1891 , a critic for the New York World described it as depicting a gray morning after a storm in mid-ocean , with gleams of fitful sunshine upon a troubled sea . On the deck of a steamer , evidently a large Atlantic liner which has stopped , an officer and sailors are rushing towards a boat into which two sailors have already tumbled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the rescue of a far off ship under full sail which is standing towards them. ( 13 ) This description ( along with a photogravure of the painting in its original state ) tells us that The Signal of Distress was conceived as a heroic painting depicting at least the possibility of a dramatic rescue . But when Homer repainted the picture and changed the full-rigged vessel to a dismasted , apparently lifeless hulk , he completely altered its spirit , replacing hope with a tragic sense of futility . As we have seen with Breezing Up , Homer often made such changes to his works , although they were rarely as dramatic as they were in The Signal of Distress . Sometimes he seems to have made alterations in response to criticisms or misunderstandings of his pictures , as was the case with Hound and Hunter ( Pl . IX ) , which disturbed many viewers when it was first exhibited because they thought the hunter was drowning the deer . ( Pl . IX omitted ) Homer repainted the area around the deer 's head to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testily wrote : The critics may think that the deer is alive but he is not  --  otherwise the boat &; man would be knocked high dry . I can shut the deer eyes and put pennies on them if that will make it better understood .... It is a simple thing to make a man out an Ass &; fool by starting from a mistaken idea . So anyone thinks this deer alive is wrong. ( 14 ) As his words and brush make clear , the story that Homer wished to tell in Hound and Hunter did not concern the details of a specific hunting incident , but something larger and more profoundly troubling . Deer hunting in the Adirondacks was no longer a matter of seeking sustenance , but was often pursued by individuals who discarded the meat and sold the skins and antlers to souvenir or trophy seekers . This particular deer may die , but the motivations of its killer and of the society of which he is a part will not vanish easily . During the 1890s Homer also took up the subject that became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today ) virtually synonymous with his name : the sea . He had , of course , painted the sea many times before , but it was always as the setting for some human drama . In works such as Northeaster ( Pl . X ) , it became the true protagonist . ( Pl . X omitted ) These canvases , with their dynamic compositions , richly brushed passages of paint , and powerful oppositions of water and rock , seem to capture the elemental power of the sea . When humans are present , they are invariably small and insignificant in the over-all composition . In Northeaster , for example , two men in sou'westers were originally crouched on the rocks below the tower of spray at the left , but Homer painted them out , which , he wrote , " made it much finer . " ( 15 ) In this sense , the story of these works was very simple ; as Lloyd Goodrich observed , " Dramatic action was what interested him ; and this the sea supplied , to take the place of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle with the land . " ( 16 ) Still , given Homer 's resistance to simple narrative meanings in his paintings , one wonders whether this was all he found in the subject of the sea . The geologist Nathaniel Southgate Shaler ( 1841-1906 ) wrote in 1892 : although the contest between sea and land is the most ancient , far extended , and unbroken of the many combats which make up the life of this sphere , neither side is ever victorious or is ever likely to prevail . It is indeed only in a metaphoric way that it can be called a battle at all. ( 17 ) And the popular nineteenth-century preacher and writer Henry Ward Beecher ( 1813-1887 ) noted : The ocean has no permanent objects . The waves of yesterday are gone to-day ; and the calm of to-day will be tumultuous tomorrow . The very effect of the sea , in part depends upon its exceeding changeableness . Upon what can we hang our associations ?  --  The sea forces life away from us . We stand upon its shore as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the act of forgetting all the things that are behind , and reaching forth unto those things which are before and beyond. ( 18 ) Herman Melville 's Ishmael had given voice to this view when he spoke of the sea in the first chapter of Moby-Dick as " the image of the ungraspable phantom of life ... the key to it all . " ( 19 ) Homer 's late seascapes can be read as pictorial expressions of that " ungraspable phantom of life " or , as his first biographer , William Howe Downes ( 1854-1941 ) , concluded , as " the image of Eternity . " ( 20 ) To look at one of these pictures is to glimpse the very essence of the forever unknowable . Perhaps this will seem too strong a claim , for it proposes that Homer was profoundly aware of the most challenging and complex questions posed by human existence . Certainly , he is not customarily viewed as having especially strong inclinations toward philosophical or metaphysical musings , but late works such as The Gulf Stream ; Cape Trinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right and Left ( Pl . XIII ) simply do not make sense as mere images of reality . ( Pl . XII and Pl . XIII omitted ) Rather , they must be seen as the creations of an artist who had deeply pondered life 's experiences and its unanswerable questions and was now reckoning with mortality . Cape Trinity , Saguenay River , which Homer began in 1904 but did not complete until 1909 , has occupied an uncertain place in evaluations of his work , largely because it seems so different from his more familiar images . Canada 's Saguenay River , a major tributary of the Saint Lawrence , was well known to tourists for its scenery , even though it was not at all conventionally scenic . It was described as a " gloomy fjord ... grand but sombre " ( 21 ) and called " the Stygian river . " ( 22 ) According to one guidebook , Anything which recalls the life and smile of nature is not in unison with the huge , naked cliffs , raw , cold , and silent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the tourist emerges from its sullen gloom , and looks back upon it as a kind of vault .  --  Nature 's sarcophagus. ( 23 ) Karl Baedeker 's guide to Canada described Cape Trinity as the " culmination of the sublime scenery of the Saguenay  --  rising perfectly sheer from the black water , a naked wall of granite . " ( 24 ) Homer wrote that his painting was " a most truthful rendering of this most beautiful &; impressive cape " and , in a way that distanced it from the usual conventions of tourist images , noted that it was painted " from a point of view impossible to take by photograph . " ( 25 ) Virtually monochromatic , charged with a somber mood suggestive of death and eternity , Cape Trinity is a symbolic landscape , one with more than a passing resemblance to the Swiss artist Arnold Boecklin 's ( 1827-1901 ) famous paintings entitled The Island of the Dead. ( 26 ) Homer finished Cape Trinity fifteen months before his death , and episodes of serious illness ( including a debilitating stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwell upon his own mortality . That may also have been the case with Right and Left ( Pl . XIII ) , which Homer had completed earlier in 1909 . ( Pl . XIII omitted ) Whether Homer painted Right and Left with his own death in mind can not be said with certainty ( he had , in 1895 , predicted  --  nearly exactly , as it turned out  --  that he had fourteen years left to live ) . ( 27 ) But death is unquestionably and unavoidably its subject , and there can be no doubt that in this painting Homer wanted to put the viewer in the line of fire and bring him face to face with death . Two ducks have risen from the water attempting to escape the shots fired by the hunter in the distant boat. ( 28 ) One appears to fall ( or turn ) back toward the water while the other seems , for the moment at least , to continue its upward flight . Although the question of what will happen to the ducks has been much speculated upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear that we are witnessing what John Wilmerding has described as " the momentary and the universal , mortality illuminated by showing these creatures at the juncture of life and death . " ( 30 ) In this last great work , Homer has yet again demonstrated that the most profound meanings lay not in concluding the narrative of a story but by showing viewers the very moment when difficult questions have been posed , but no easy answers have been provided .
