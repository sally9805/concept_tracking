Many people think it 's difficult to predict technological advancements . But it 's not always as hard as it seems . What 's more difficult is predicting the technology that will really change our lives and how it will affect us . Back around the beginning of this century , there were many scientists and science writers who predicted we 'd fly to the moon before the century was over . But none of them foresaw an even more amazing feat  --  that we would all be able to sit in our living room and watch while those first men walked on the moon . They did n't foresee television , which is one of the technologies that changed our lives the most this century . Earlier this year , we at Battelle gathered our most-visionary technology experts and asked them what were going to be the biggest technologies in the business world 10 years from now . We set three guidelines for our experts : 1 These technologies must provide a benefit and be of value to the end user . 2 The companies that develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using them . 3 These technologies must support a company 's business goals . In other words , these are the technologies that are going to make a lot of money for someone . We were n't looking at government-sponsored technologies . Instead , we focused on the technologies that businesses would be wise to pursue right now . And now , from the bottom up , here are our top 10. 10 Edutainment Computer software and other products related to " edutainment " include educational games and computerized simulations . Students today are much more technologically sophisticated than their parents ever were . And you can bet that tomorrow 's students will be even more adept with technology than today 's whiz kids . Tomorrow 's students will expect much more from education , and so will their parents . That will mean a big payoff for companies that can develop products that put more education into entertainment and more entertainment into education . In five to 10 years , most textbook publishers will have software developers working alongside their authors . We 're going to see applications for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the workplace , where retraining the work force will continue to be more and more important . 9 Hybrid-Fuel Vehicles In 10 years , the automobile in your driveway could be running on two different fuels , one for acceleration and the other for maintaining your speed . Most likely the fuels will be reformulated gasoline plus something else . The " other " fuel would depend on a variety of factors . In some parts of the country , such as the Pacific Northwest , that other fuel might be electricity  --  if we can improve battery technology . But in Iowa , the other fuel might be ethanol ; in Colorado , maybe natural gas . At Battelle , we recently completed the country 's largest alternative-fuels program . In the program , more than 100 FedEx delivery trucks in Southern California ran on five different fuels over two years . There was no clear-cut winner , however . We found that they all had lower emissions , but none stood head and shoulders above the others . No single fuel would be able to meet all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at the pros and cons of each fuel before deciding which way to go . 8 Medical Treatments Within the next 10 years , we 'll see the development of a number of new and more-effective ways to detect and treat diseases . We 'll have new diagnostic tools that use highly accurate sensors to detect diseases at very early stages . At Battelle , we now have a machine that can measure gases in parts per trillion . If a patient has cirrhosis of the liver , or lung cancer , or a number of other diseases  --  even at very early stages  --  his or her breath contains small amounts of certain chemicals . If doctors could detect those chemicals , then they might be able to detect a disease just by analyzing the patient 's breath . In addition to detecting diseases earlier , we 'll also be able to treat them more effectively with drug-delivery systems that target specific parts of the body . Imagine chemotherapy that could target just cancer cells so you would n't lose your hair or experience other harmful side effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way we can prevent aging , but we will be able to make the process a little less traumatic . These new developments may range from aging creams that actually work to an effective cure for baldness . The aging of the youth-oriented baby boomers makes these technologies especially marketable in the years ahead . 6 Smart Manufacturing Shoppers will link up directly to the factory floor . New , smart systems will control manufacturing processes and create individual products for individual consumers . In 10 years , when you need a new suit , you might head down to your favorite store , but instead of trying on a lot of clothes , you 'll just pick out a style and a fabric and then have all your measurements taken electronically . Those measurements , along with your order , will go immediately to the factory . A few days later , your perfectly tailored suit will come straight to your home . Factories will also be using these smart systems to gather information from sensors up and down the assembly line . The systems will automatically make decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixing a piece of equipment , or ordering supplies . 5 Miniaturization A decade from now , it will be possible for you to carry around a laptop computer about the size of a pocket calculator . These new products will be interactive , wireless data centers . You might use it as a fax , a phone , a source for news or stockmarket reports , and as a tool for accessing more information than is in your library . In addition to this supercomputer in your pocket , you 'll also be carrying around smart cards that have the power of a computer and will perform a number of daily activities for you . They might serve as the key for your car , or your personal calendar , or a record of your complete medical history . They can also serve as money . Battelle is working on a project that will put these smart cards to work on college campuses , so students could pay their tuition , sign up for classes , download textbooks onto their computer , do their laundry , and order a pizza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 15 years there will be a billion computers and smart cards in the United States . 4 Digital HDTV Digital high-definition television could well be the next hot item in the entertainment industry . The important word to remember there is digital . The predictions most of us have heard are that HDTV will make the quality of your television picture approach the quality of a movie screen . The first time you see one of these digital HDTV sets will be like the first time you saw color TV . And they 're going to do the same thing to old color TVs that compact discs did to the LP . American companies will likely be the leaders in the global HDTV market . For several years , Japanese companies have been working on analog HDTV , and they 've already come out with some products . But a few American companies have taken the lead in digital HDTV , and that 's really where the market is going to go . Now , we need one manufacturer to step forward and set the standard for others to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became for the videotape industry . This is a multibillion-dollar industry , just in terms of the market for television sets alone . After all , more homes in the United States have televisions than have telephones . But this HDTV technology will also lead to better computer images for advanced computer modeling and imaging . Eventually , within 20 years or so , your digital HDTV will have a very large but very thin screen , and you 'll hang it on the wall like a picture . At Battelle , we 've already developed that display screen technology for use in military aircraft . 3 High-Density Energy Sources We 'll be developing amazing electronics , but we 'll have to find ways to harness the energy to use them . We 'll have to develop portable , inexpensive fuel sources so that we 'll have energy available where and when we need it . Innovations in batteries and materials will pave the way for these new fuel sources . And this innovation will be driven , to a great extent , by the electric-vehicle market . These new batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the globe . After all , you ca n't use a laptop if you do n't have the energy to operate it . 2 Super Materials Currently , to make new materials , we have to combine two or more other materials , maybe under intense heat , or pressure , or some other circumstance . Then we can alter the makeup of the material to make it fit our needs . It can be an extremely long and difficult process to develop a material with exactly the desired characteristics . There 's a lot of trial and error involved . Within 10 years , we 'll actually be designing new materials at the molecular level . We 'll be able to manipulate the molecules in a material to make it lighter , stronger , more flexible , or whatever we need . For example , polyethylene is a material that we now use every day in a variety of forms , just by changing the structure of the molecule . At one end of the spectrum , we use it as paraffin oil . But we can make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can alter it again and use it to make sandwich bags . Or , making the molecule even stronger , we can make trash bags that wo n't puncture . Or , finally , we can make it so strong that we can weave polyethylene fibers into unbreakable sails for boats . In 10 to 20 years , we 'll be using hundreds of new , high-performance super materials in the transportation industry , computers , energy , and communications , to name just a few . The potential for these new materials seems almost unlimited , because the number of molecules in the world is virtually unlimited . 1 Genetic Mapping We 're standing at the threshold of a golden age for biology . Over the next few decades , we 'll begin to thoroughly understand biological processes and the causes of disease . In fact , if you look back at where the computer industry was 10 or 15 years ago , that 's where biological and genetic research is now . Today , there 's a great deal of research going on to map the human genome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic material . What we 're doing right now is defining the volumes in that encyclopedia , and that should be finished by the year 2000 . For instance , a group of scientists recently reported that they may have discovered the master control gene for the formation of the eye . After this stage of defining the volumes in our genetic encyclopedia , then we 'll concentrate on defining problem areas . We 're seeing the beginning of that type of research with discoveries of gene flaws that may be connected to kidney and breast cancer , leukemia , dyslexia , Alzheimer 's disease , Lou Gehrig 's disease  --  even alcoholism and obesity . The result of this research will be an explosion in new medical treatments and cures over the next 20 years . This genetic research may in the next 10 years lead to cures for specific types of cancer  --  and possibly even AIDS . We 'll also see many other new life-saving treatments . For instance , we predict that over the next quarter century we 'll prevent 13 million deaths from heart disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths from lung cancer , leukemia , and colorectal cancer . But along with all these new medical treatments , our genetic advances will raise some of the most difficult ethical issues that we 'll face in this period . Say , for instance , that you find out that you carry the gene defect that makes you more susceptible to developing Alzheimer 's disease at an early age . Maybe that discovery will allow you to start monitoring for the disease and maybe even take some new treatment . But at some time down the road , insurance companies and potential employers may want to see your genetic makeup before deciding to cover or hire you . Before you decide to marry someone , you might want to see your beloved 's genetic scorecard . Obviously , these are going to be extremely complex issues , and we 're going to be facing them very soon . But perhaps we 'd all gladly take on these types of issues if we could find cures for some of the deadly diseases facing us today . Seeking Opportunities In Technology None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970s , when I was working at Pacific Northwest Laboratories , lots of people thought the big research push over the next 20 years would be in alternative energy sources . But 20 years later , we 're still driving cars powered by gasoline , and most of the homes in the United States still get their heat and electricity from oil , natural gas , and coal-burning power plants . What happened was that more oil became available , energy prices fell , and the immediate need disappeared . Consequently , R &D; investments in that area shrank significantly . Clearly , we still need new energy sources , so we still need that research . But since there 's no immediate market for those products , there 's no money for the research . Some of our top-10 technologies could have the same fate These are n't sure things ; they 're opportunities . If the right investments are made in these technologies , they 'll likely produce some rich rewards . Other Technologies Of Note A few significant areas of technology research and development just missed Battelle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next decade . * Global Positioning Systems ( GPS ) . Among other uses , GPS will allow some prisoners to remain at home , because the police could monitor exactly where they are at all times . It could also track our children wherever they are . That could be a big deterrent to kidnapping . We 'll also use CPS to track stolen cars or even find lost pets . * Husbandry of the oceans . Within 10 years , we 'll be repopulating the oceans as a source for food . * Recyclability . Many products will be totally recyclable or reusable . Even products like automobiles and refrigerators will be designed to be completely recycled or reused. * Domestic robots . We may even have robotic devices that will clean the house or mow the lawn . Finally , I hope there will be some new technology that will help us avert a possible water crisis . Clean water is quickly becoming scarcer in m parts of the world , and within the next 15 years , a barrel of clean water could cost $20 .
