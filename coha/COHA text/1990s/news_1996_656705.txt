<p> The undaunted pigs have just arrived from England . Teatime , they are told , will be on Sunday . Quicker than you can say , " Gloucestershire Old Spots , " they snort and grumble , and bury their 200-pound bodies in the hay for warmth and dignity . Sunday indeed . <p> Robyn Metcalfe offered teatime last week to playfully introduce the pigs to the local media . Come get your porcine quotes directly from Patrick , Princess , Muriel , Princess Mary , and Josephine . But Metcalfe 's promotional gambit ( or pigbit ? ) is part of her serious effort to ensure the preservation of rare breeds and offer public access to Kelmscott Farm 's educational activities and products made from some of the animals . <p> Mrs. Metcalfe and her husband , Bob , founded Kelmscott Farm here last year to preserve rare livestock breeds . After only a year of operation , the farm is now home to a veritable ark of rare animals , including : a huge Shire horse named " Pete , " Shetland and Dartmoor ponies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep ( a small , multihorned breed mentioned in the Bible ) and rare chickens . A pair of horned Kerry cows from Ireland will arrive in the spring . And the tall llama towering over the sheep in the barn is " Coco , " the implacable security guard . <p> Genetic diversity at stake <p> Watching the pigs grumble in the hay , Metcalfe says , " With the loss of many livestock breeds , we are losing genetic diversity . Some of the animals already have organizations that are cheering them on , but we want to go after the ones that really need help . We also think of these animals as living history . " <p> Inside the barn at Kelmscott Farm , the temperature is in the teens . Outside , knife-like wind blows snow in all directions around the cluster of white buildings on the hill . Jolly old England was never so brutishly cold for pigs of such pedigree . <p> These pigs will grow to a lumbering 600 pounds , Metcalfe says , grinning with delight that the five of them have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other lop-eared Gloucestershire Old Spots were known to be in the United States . And only a few hundred survive worldwide , according to the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy ( ALBC ) . Now for the first time in years , the US will have a breeding group of pedigreed Gloucestershire Old Spots . <p> What has happened to domestic species , in contrast to wildlife , is that over the years genetics in livestock have been segregated and selected for uniformity by man . Turkeys , for example , are now grown quickly , with bulging breast meat , in response to the marketplace . <p> " But a turkey is now a creature approaching biological unfitness because it ca n't reproduce without human intervention , " says Don Bixby a veterinarian and executive director of the ALBC . " Without massive human support , our commercial turkey industry would be extinct in one generation . If we do n't have genetic diversity among livestock , then we do n't have options to change . " <p> Although not faced with that kind of extinction , Gloucestershire Old Spots grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs also have more fat on their bodies than most other pigs . <p> But Metcalfe and other breed conservationists suspect that what is commercially viable today could spiral into disfavor tomorrow . Or disappear entirely . If so , Kelmscott Farm , and other farms around the country that foster rare breeds , will have breeds with sought-after characteristics . <p> Old Spots are very hardy , manageable , and a grazing breed , which means they can be turned out to graze in summer , thus saving on the cost of feed . <p> " In the old days , many animals were multipurpose , " says Nick Richardson , Kelmscott 's farm manager from England , noting the example of the Cotswold sheep . Providing long , curly wool with a high luster , the sheep were introduced to England by the Roman Army for wool and meat . <p> Today most people prefer softer wool than the Cotswolds provide . Synthetic fibers are also popular , and farmers simply want a faster-growing animal . So while they once numbered in the tens of thousands in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cotswolds existed in England , and in 1978 only 78 lambs were registered in the US . <p> " The Romans did n't care that Cotswolds were slow-growing because they wanted the meat and the wool . Now we want everything to grow at 60 miles an hour , " Mr. Richardson says . <p> Building sheep populations <p> Several dozen Cotswold sheep now reside in the pens at Kelmscott Farm . And a cooperative venture with the University of Maine involves Cromwell , a black Cotswold sheep from Kelmscott being studied for his blackness . Across the US , the Cotswolds ' numbers have risen to between 1,000 and 1,500 . <p> " To preserve rare breeds , " Metcalfe says , " one way is to find useful commercial purposes . " Through a distributor , Kelmscott sold fresh lamb last year free of antibiotics or added hormones . Even at $ 15 a pound , the lamb sold out in three days at the French &; Brawn Marketplace in Camden , Maine . <p> In addition , Kelmscott 's small catalogue offers Cotswold wool scarves , blankets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sweatermakers . <p> What motivated Metcalfe and her husband , Bob , to create Kelmscott Farm is symbolically realized in their Kelmscott rug , a 3-by-5-foot wool rug offered in the catalogue . It is based on the designs of William Morris , the 19th-century English poet , designer , and social reformer . <p> Kelmscott is the name of Morris 's summer home in England . This year marks the centenary of his death . <p> " What we want to do here , " Metcalfe says , " is embody Morris 's beauty-plus-utility philosophy throughout the farm and our lives . " <p> Bob Metcalfe , Robyn 's husband , founded the 3Com Corporation in 1979 , is the inventer of Ethernet , and now writes a column for InfoWorld magazine . " Even though we were quite comfortable , " says Robyn of their life near San Francisco with their two young children , " we felt we wanted a total change of lifestyle to connect to values we cherished . " <p> The family spent a year in England , and slowly Robyn 's interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so expensive , " she says . " And when I learned that Cotswolds were really on the critical list , sheep seemed like a natural place to begin this adventure . " <p> But all was not smooth on the road to Kelmscott . " In California , where we had sheep for a while , " Robyn says with a laugh , " I was reported for llama abuse . I left them out in the rain . " <p> Because the Metcalfe family had spent several summers in Maine , they decided to look for a farm here to launch their dream . " We looked at this property first , " says Bob , " and then went to 20 other farms before we came back and bought it . " <p> The farmhouse , now renovated and expanded , sits on a high hill with a stunning view of their 145 acres . The original barn is used for horses , and a new barn is for the sheep and pigs . <p> In the warmer months , schoolchildren visit here , and the farm is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals is available - and why not be an adoptive parent of Princess Mary for $ 25 ? The farm also has a site on the Internet . " When children visit us , " Richardson says . " we give them a button that says , ' I had a wild and wooly time at Kelmscott Farm . ' "
