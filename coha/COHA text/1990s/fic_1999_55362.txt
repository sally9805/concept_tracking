Many people in New York City stay up all night . I am one of them . I do n't know who the other ones are . Except for Walter , and Walter says things like , " I think my fingerprints are wearing off . " Things like that , things other people do n't think about . <p> At two a.m. , my phone rings . " Get lost , " I say into the receiver . Then I hang up . I close the blinds , not so much because I am afraid Walter is looking in , but because there are times I ca n't help looking in on him . He lives twenty feet away , across the alley . On nights when I let Walter come over at one or two or three in the morning , he is more often than not the bearer of odd little gifts : a plastic Baggie full of extremely small pieces of chopped-up dried fruit , or those little bottles of lotion that they give you in the hospital , the ones that say not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat-up frame , which I had seen in the trash pile outside my building the day before . <p> " What is this shit ? " I 'll say . <p> He 'll either shrug or smile . His smile is very beautiful , wide and full . He has an open face . You ca n't picture him wincing . His eyes just crinkle nicely around the edges . Neither one of us is particularly young anymore , nor is anyone I know particularly young anymore . Walter also brings with him a ridiculous mood . All is right with the world . Life is good . I suspect medication . <p> I begin work , digging into my bag full of English exams to be graded . I am an adjunct professor at three different schools . Night classes , of course . And I teach a poetry class at the Y. <p> At two-thirty the phone rings again . <p> " I said fuck off , " I say into the receiver . Again I hang up . <p> The phone rings again . <p> " Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , Gary . <p> " What are you doing up ? " I say . With Gary it almost always works to change the subject to him . <p> " They woke me up , " he says on a hiss . " They wanted to stick me with needles , take my blood pressure , and weigh me , " he goes on . " They wanted to see how much a skeleton weighs at two o'clock in the morning . Un-fucking-believable . " <p> " Can you try and go back to sleep ? " I say . <p> " How can I , " he shrieks , " when my nurse is wearing angel earrings and this totally alarming little angel broach/pin thing ? " <p> Lately my brother has added angels to his list of things he finds intolerable . <p> " People can not truly believe they are having encounters with angels , " he begins . " I mean , have these people exhausted the potential of their UFO sightings and their alien abductions ? It 's all part of the dumbing down of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western civilization . Superstition and dumb religion and pathetic , sexless cults and everything just falling to pieces . " <p> " Sexless cults ? " I ask , digging in my bag for a red pen . I never use the red pen for the poetry students . Poetry should never be touched by a red pen . <p> " You know , those bald eunuchs , " he says , impatiently , " the ones in California who committed group suicide with their brand-new sneakers on . " <p> " Oh , yeah . " <p> " What the hell is the point of a cult if there is n't some weird , perverted sex thing going on ? " he rails . <p> " Gary , Gary , you know the angel thing is just an aspect of contemporary mythology , " I say . " Millennium-anxiety stuff . " <p> " Oh , that 's just trash , " he spits , " pure trash . " <p> " People who see angels believe in their experiences . They pass lie detector tests , right ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream . " <p> " Well , you can leave me out of the dream , sister , " he says . <p> " What I 'm saying , Gary , is that it does n't matter whether people are actually seeing angels , but it may matter that people believe that they are seeing them , " I say . " Has your temperature gone down any ? " I ask . Gary has pneumonia again . The bad kind . <p> " Do n't be such a Jungian , " he says . " Your anti-intellectual positions are really beginning to bore and depress me . What are you turning into , anyway ? " <p> " Why do n't you ask for a shot of Demerol ? " <p> " I 'm glad I wo n't be around to see it all fall down around us , Libby . I 'm not kidding , " he says . " I 'm glad . " <p> " Can you just calm down a little ? " I say . " You 're going to set yourself up for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , beginning to cough , " no , I ca n't just calm down . " <p> " I think you should call the nurse , " I say . <p> " I ca n't . The angels , " he says , hacking away and gasping for breath . <p> I hang up and call the nurse 's station . I ask Gary 's nurse , Mrs. Johnson , if she would mind taking off the angel earrings and the little pin . She is a very nice person and agrees to do it for the patient 's sake . <p> " You have to humor some people , " she tells me . <p> " Do n't we know it , " I tell her . With Mrs. Johnson , it is best to offer her the juiciness of a conspiracy , one which places her at the center . <p> Every once in a while I take the sleeping-pill route , but sleeping pills are never more than a temporary solution and nothing to change your life over . Eventually , sleeping pills make you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do your work or face the world , which are things that might be a problem to start with . Psychiatrists have been no help , because they are in love with sleeping pills , which , from the oxygen-depleted heights of their love cloud , they continue to insist have no side effects , even after you say things like , " I 'm hallucinating . I feel psychotic and violent . I might kill someone . " Every once in a while I try a new psychiatrist , who may say something new , but depressingly obvious and homespun , like , " Have you tried warm milk ? How about hot baths ? " As though I would n't have tried those things when I have had insomnia since the third grade . As my brother used to shriek at bad drivers , " Drive much ? " Practice medicine much ? But nobody knows very much about sleep . Anybody who says they do is lying . <p> The phone rings , but I have run out of the will to tell anyone to fuck off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I let it ring and turn on the TV . I flip around the dial , looking for something , I do n't know what . I used to watch all-night cable reruns of Dallas over the phone with my friend Yvette . At the commercials we would talk about our ongoing money problems , what kind of diets we were on , her failure to achieve success as an actress , my failure to achieve success as a screenwriter , and if we had to sleep with a Dallas cast member , which one would be the least disgusting . Male and female . We tried to be fair . But Yvette got married and stopped staying up all night . She had a baby and sent me a picture of a glum-looking child , dressed in a fairy costume and holding a wand . <p> I keep flipping , my hand on automatic , pressing and pressing the remote , watching the light and the color and the faces change , until I realize that I want the television itself to turn into something else . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will resemble it , whatever you desire , and at the same time it will never come close . It will always remind , and it will always disappoint . My feelings of disappointment begin to cause the physical symptoms you would associate with the bad side of drugs . Headache . Nausea . Sour stomach . Dry mouth . Metallic taste in dry mouth . <p> I pick up the phone . <p> " Can I come over ? " Walter asks . <p> " Walter , why do you let me treat you like shit and say mean things to you ? " <p> " Because I know you do n't mean it , " he says . <p> " How ? " I ask . " How do you know I do n't mean it ? " <p> " I do n't know , " he says . " Can I come over ? " <p> " Walter , have you ever seen an angel ? " I ask . <p> " Seen one ? No , " he says . " But I have heard them now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rite Aid bag full of yellow Post-it notes . Rite Aid is open all night . <p> " Walter , this is n't bad , " I say , taking the bag . " I can actually use these . " <p> He smiles . It is a wide , foolish smile . Walter 's brown hair is abnormally shiny for an adult . It is thick and silky , like a child 's hair , but often full of bits of plaster or paint from the endless work he does on his apartment . <p> He sits on the couch and I pick the pieces of plaster out of his hair . He is knocking out walls over there , or something . Putting up new , different walls in their place . Or maybe he is putting the exact same walls back up . I do n't know what he does . His parents are rich and give him money , I know that . He has two psychiatrists , one female and one male , whom he calls Mom and Dad . One of the two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes I can see him lifting weights . He has a lot of gym equipment and no furniture . His arm muscles are beautiful . They are the long , sinewy kind of arm muscles . His skin is very smooth . You can trace his veins with your fingers . <p> " I ca n't find Tuffy , " he says . <p> " You know Tuffy , " I say , still finding hardened , white bits in Walter 's hair . " Tuffy is a cowboy . He likes to roam . He 'll turn up . " <p> Tuffy is an orange tomcat with chewed-up ears who lives in the alley between our buildings . That 's how I met Walter , we were both out there with our little cans of Fancy Feast , feeding the strays . My own cat was dying on a blanket on my living-room chair , and that night I could n't stand the howling anymore . The strays howl and howl , caterwauling , a raw , desperate sound that scrapes at your insides if you listen to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block it out . Walter walked me back to my apartment and asked if he could kiss me . I said he could kiss my arm , which he did , for an hour and fifteen minutes . Just my arm . <p> I smooth out Walter 's hair , which is thick and straight , and still shiny , despite the residue of plaster . Walter has the kind of hair that if he bounced on a trampoline would always fall perfectly back into place . Sometimes when I imagine Walter I see him flying up in the air , and then landing , hair flying up and then lying flat , up and down like that . Weeee . <p> " Sometimes I think my fingerprints are wearing off , " he says , looking down at his hands . " Have you ever thought about that ? " <p> " You 've mentioned that before , " I say . " And , no , I never think about it . " <p> Now it is Walter 's turn to do my hair . He brushes and brushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , to be a cupcake . With frosting . To be sitting on a plate , waiting to be devoured . At my age . Just when you 're thinking you 'll never be a cupcake again . <p> I lie back on the couch , and Walter lies down on top of me . For the moment all I want is to feel his weight bearing down on me , to feel the sensation of weight , to be held beneath it , and made aware again of weight itself . There is a surprising amount of comfort to be found in the simple fact of gravity . But Walter is a man , after all , and begins to move against me . I would like it if he just lay still , but of course I also would n't have it any other way . <p> Walter slips his hands underneath my back and works them down along my spine until he reaches my hips . He pulls us together with one sudden thrust , so quickly , and with such astonishing ease , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to fit together , that for a moment I ca n't speak or think or breathe . It 's a form of genius maybe , this knowledge of his . A gift , a talent , a skill at hand . I could ask why . I could be foolish and ask why , in this one way , this person is perfect for me . But instead I let him take my clothes off , piece by piece , and then again cover my body with his . <p> Later , in my bed , I watch Walter sleep . I love the way he smells . He smells of something entirely pleasant , something familiar yet difficult to place , like a particular plant or flower , a summer drink or an outdoor cooking smell , something like that , from childhood outside the city . For some reason I do n't ever want to learn what it is . I just want to smell it . I just want to close my eyes and smell it . <p> Here is the thing about spring : Spring uncovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , take a garbage can on a street corner , somewhere in another part of the city , something benign and commonplace . In the winter that garbage can would be filled with standard New York-issue garbage , pizza boxes and newspapers and soda cans , and snow . You would be cold , and you would hurry right by , pulling the collar of your coat close against your bare throat , which would be inadequately wrapped against the freezing winter wind . You would have things on your mind . <p> In spring , the garbage can on the street corner in another part of the city would not be filled with snow . You would be walking along , and you would not be cold or in much of a hurry , and the weather with its pleasant breezes and low barometric pressure would wake up your skin and intoxicate you , and you would not have all that much on your mind . You would notice the garbage can , and realize that once , after a party , a long time ago , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would remember the party itself , where a man and a woman fought over you , while you , getting drunker and drunker , let them . Then you would begin to remember the rest of your life around that time , your restaurant jobs , the clothing you wore , a favorite pair of beat-up black cowboy boots in particular , the couch you slept on , huddled on , clung to like a life raft , as though the rest of the world were shark-infested waters , the time they turned off your lights , the time they turned off your phone , the time things got stolen because you could n't remember to lock your apartment door , the danger you knew you were in , the ridiculous good health of everyone around you , and , worst of all , your aspirations at the time , your dreams of something for yourself . <p> I am on my way to the hospital to visit Gary when I see a man standing on the subway platform who could well be my ex-husband . <p> Spring has uncovered my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turn away quickly , realizing I am unprotected , realizing that spring can uncover me as easily as any other hidden thing . <p> When the train appears , I leap into the car and disappear behind two large women and their giant Macy 's shopping bags . When I am safe behind the closing doors , I take a look out the window . He is different , but it is definitely him . He is a balding actor who looks like a balding businessman , and so , used to go around New York to auditions dressed like one , with a suit and a tie and a briefcase . He appeared in dozens of commercials and print ads , always as a balding businessman with a suit and a tie and a briefcase . The whole enterprise showed a lack of imagination all around . He looks different now , or rather he looks exactly the same but is dressed differently , in ripped jeans , a faded T-shirt , and scruffed-up work boots . He has a red bandanna tied around his head . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , collapsing with relief on the foot of Gary 's hospital bed . <p> " He has transformed himself from one kind of asshole into a completely different kind of asshole , " Gary says . <p> " Yes , " I say , " that is exactly what he 's done . " Now that Gary has summed up the experience , made some kind of sense of it , I feel I can move off of the bed . I 've brought Gary a large bunch of peonies in full bloom . It 's their time of year . They smell of our backyard at home in Virginia , and the yard of our next-door neighbor , and the yards of all of our friends and enemies , the green lawns of our childhood . <p> " Smell these , " I say . " Do n't they just remind you of everything ? " <p> " Get that shit away from me , " he says , waving the peonies away . " I do n't want to be reminded of everything . " <p> I remove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to say for himself ? " Gary asks . <p> " Who ? " <p> " Actor Man , " he says . Gary always called my ex-husband Actor Man . <p> " Nothing , " I say , arranging the peonies in one of Gary 's many vases . Gary enjoys his crystal . He has always loved his things , separate from any ranking in status they may provide , which , I suppose , is the way to love your things , even though this love of things has always somehow unnerved me , in Gary , anyway . Especially all the crystal . He always kept it all so sparkly . And it was always everywhere , sparkling and reflecting . <p> " He was jumping onto the subway , and he did n't see me , " I say , " but he was carrying a harmonica , I think . " <p> " Stop it . He was n't , " says Gary , beginning to laugh . " Tell me Actor Man was n't carrying a harmonica . " <p> " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I could just tell the harmonica was part of this new Mr. Dirty Red Bandanna persona . " <p> " You know that laughing makes me cough , " says Gary , laughing . " Stop torturing me . " <p> Gary reminds me of how my ex-husband and his actor friends used to sit around talking about Marlon Brando , James Dean , and the Actor 's Studio . <p> " For sheer banality and lack of original insight , you just could n't beat those conversations , " Gary says . <p> Gary begins to imitate my ex-husband and his friends going on and on about how Marlon Brando played Stanley Kowalski as an ape . <p> Even though Gary was skinny and effeminate as a boy , the other kids called him " Scary Gary , " or just plain " Scary , " which he was . He had an uncanny ability for mimicry , in which he would pick out the key details of another kid 's physicality , flaws , really , like an almost undetectable speech impediment caused by an overbite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been surgically corrected in infancy . He had a talent for bringing the defect front and center , exaggerating it out of proportion until it was all you could see about the person . Nobody wanted to be the subject of one of Gary 's humiliating impressions . Gary had his tormentors , boys who would pull his pants off and run them up the flagpole . Stuff like that . There were wedgies and black eyes and the various expressions generally associated with Gary 's condition . Faggot , and so on . But gradually , Gary would win over even the tormentors with his hilarious , exaggerated versions of teachers , other kids , and even the tormentors themselves . Gary says his childhood taught him two very important things about life : People were mean , and they liked to laugh . <p> I have buried my face in the peonies , inhaling again , unable to get enough . They are at the height of their bloom , fanned-out and blossoming extravagantly . Soon they will begin to turn down slightly at the edges and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe . <p> " Why on earth did I marry him ? " I say out loud , and instantly regret this utterance . Gary tends to remember everything I forget . Gary tends to remember everything in general , and in stark detail . He never sifts though details and comes up with a selective account of anything . He remembers times and dates and what was said and to whom , everyone 's least noble motivations , weaknesses and needs and endless humiliations . Everything bad and good and inconsequential . And what everyone was wearing , especially him . He can still tell you what he wore to high school on any given day . <p> " The apartment , " he practically shrieks . " You ca n't have forgotten his duplex on West 70th Street . " <p> " Yes , " I say , noting that Gary has let me off the hook fairly easily , because there must have been more to it at the time . There must have been weaknesses and needs . " But I barely remember it now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long I lived there . " <p> " Three months , " he says , " almost exactly . " <p> " Is that all ? " <p> " You were acting like a zombie , " he tells me . <p> " Probably , " I say . <p> " You met him in the park , " Gary goes on . " People used to do things like that , pick each other up in the park . Young people . Us . " <p> " Oh , God , the park , " I say . " The park in spring . " <p> " And by the way , " says Gary , softly , exhausted now , " they were just plain wrong about Marlon Brando . Marlon Brando played Stanley as a cat . " <p> Of course Gary is right , I think , watching him close his eyes . A cat . <p> I sit beside Gary 's bed and read a magazine from the visitor 's lounge . It 's a woman 's magazine with lots of tips . For insomnia you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a glass of milk , the combined ingredients of which produces a certain sleep-inducing chemical reaction in the brain . They say . <p> When Gary has fallen asleep , I head into the hallway to get a cup of ice for my warm Diet Coke and run into Mrs. Johnson , an absolute sight in her canary-yellow clogs and the most elaborate hairdo I have ever seen , stiff swirls of gray and black ringlets , fanned out all over her big , round head . <p> " I love your hair , " I tell her . I always tell Mrs. Johnson this because it allows me a moment to adjust to it , without having to take my focus off of it , which is just too difficult . Her granddaughter is a hairdresser . <p> " Your brother has been using an awful lot of bad language , " she tells me . " He sits in there cussing a blue streak . " Mrs. Johnson is a Baptist from North Carolina . <p> " Oh , he 's a bad one , " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to communicate the idea that we are united , just two girls up from the South trying our level best to navigate our way through Yankeeland . Here in the North , both Gary and I have a tendency to become more Southern than we ever actually were in the South . <p> " That 's sick people , " she tells me . " They say the nice ones get nicer and the mean ones get meaner . " <p> " Mrs. Johnson , you 're a peach , " I say , sashaying by her toward the ice machine . <p> I try to be pleasant to Mrs. Johnson because I actually like her , and because Mrs. Johnson is the one and only member of the hospital staff to have gracefully withstood Gary 's typed-up ( by me ) instructions on how to clean his crystal vases . But there is another reason . Gary seems to have given up his usually successful attempts at getting those in charge of his care to adore him . He has not gone to the usual trouble of flattering them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or hairstyles . <p> On the way back from the ice machine , I slip Mrs. Johnson six dollars for the collection plate at her church . For two dollars , Mrs. Johnson 's entire congregation will say a prayer for you , a pretty amazing deal . You have choices , like Jesus can forgive you , or bless you , or save your soul . I buy Gary the entire package . <p> " And do n't tell my brother , " I warn . This makes Mrs. Johnson wink , her conspirator 's version of a smile , and I know I have bought my brother one more week of Mrs. Johnson 's extra attention , if nothing else . <p> I settle back into Gary 's room with my magazine and my ice chips . I watch Gary breathe , steadily for now . We are not even forty , not until June , and my brother is already an old man . That 's the way this disease goes . Before you die , you get to see yourself grow suddenly old , with hollowed-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , the elasticity of youth gone from your skin  --  the new medications , the cocktails , came too late for Gary  --  and because Gary is my twin , I get to see something of myself wither , too . <p> Later , when I catch a glimpse of myself in the elevator mirror , I am shocked to see that the color in my face , the fullness , the vibrancy of my skin and hair , is still there . <p> Yvette calls out of the blue to update me on her second pregnancy . <p> " I 'm too tired to even swallow , " she tells me . " And I had to call it off with Rosario . I 'm just too huge for anything but the most unspeakable acts , and I 'm too tired for those .

" <p> " I 'd need to have a date first , " I tell her . " At least . " I do n't tell Yvette about Walter . I do n't tell anyone about Walter . You ca n't go to a movie with Walter . Walter is not a date . And anyway , between the two of us , the gene pool is an iffy prospect . <p> " Funny you should bring it up , " she says . " You want to go out with a really cool-looking Chinese guy ? " <p> " No . " <p> " He 's a really good friend of Artie 's . " Artie is Yvette 's husband , a movie industry accountant who wants to produce . Artie has a ponytail , too . But it is the wrong kind of ponytail . The ponytail , a frizzy , scraggly thing , is the only hair Artie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Please . He 's a full professor . " <p> " I do n't like meeting new people . I ca n't account for myself . I ca n't account for the gaps . " <p> " You jerk , " Yvette says . " It 's just the loony bin , for God 's sake . It 's not like you were in prison . Or something really embarrassing like the Peace Corps . " <p> " Forget it . " <p> " Then you have to take my little cousin out to lunch . She thinks she wants to be a writer , and I need you to talk her out of it , " she says . " I 'm too tired . " <p> " I can do that , " I tell her . <p> Yvette and I are quiet for a while . <p> " Now I 'm just waiting , " she says . " Me and my big stomach , just waiting . " <p> Insomniacs are always waiting , waiting for the bluish light of morning , for night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally quiet down . <p> " Me , too , " I say . " I 'm waiting . " <p> " Libby , it 's a good idea to know what you 're waiting for , " she says . <p> My doorbell rings . <p> " Who is it ? " I say , making sure it is Walter . <p> " My name escapes me . " It 's him . <p> Walter is standing there , holding a pineapple in front of his face . The pineapple is wearing a pair of glasses . <p> Idiot . Still , I feel a stab of desire , a need that never goes away , the longing to be touched . I begin to wonder why Walter ca n't be normal , a dangerous thought , one that ca n't be contemplated without creeping into other areas of dangerous thought , and so I stop the thought cold , because for now I just want to have my hair brushed and feel his arms pull me in and in and in . <p> We stand there in the hallway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm worried there is something wrong with the moon , " he says . " It 's moving around . It 's not in the same place as it was last night .

It is bug repellent . <p> Yvette 's cousin , Kit , is a twenty-one-year-old Columbia University student who is about to graduate this spring . She takes a seat across from me at a restaurant on Broadway which has opened its outdoor cafe for the first time this year . There is still a slight chill in the spring air , but the sun shines brilliantly . <p> I did not expect someone so utterly chic . She is dressed in brown velvet pants that flare at the ankle , high-heeled brown boots , and a bright green thigh-length coat cut to fit close to the body . Her hair is dark brown , and parted in the center , worn straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear her hair .

" Yvette said I 'd know you because you 'd look like you 're not used to being awake during the day . " <p> " She said that ? " I say , alarmed and surprisingly ashamed . I do n't usually like people to know about my sleeping habits . <p> " I think it 's cool , " she says . <p> " Poor sleep hygiene is cool ? " I say . <p> " Absolutely , " she says . " Very decadent . Very out of sync with the suburbs and minivans and snotty kids and pets .

" <p> " She also told me that you 've been in and out of the nut house , which is where the two of you met .

They are short and painted a purply-silver color , a color I have only seen on the young girls sitting across from me on the subway , or on a student of mine , a color that has n't crested yet , that has n't hit the drugstore chains . I remember that , being young and being a certain kind of girl , and knowing what was happening before someone wrote about it in the Sunday Style section of The New York Times , by which time it was surely on its way toward the rest of the country , and then the malls and the high school girls and their mothers , and then all of a sudden over and done with , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says " Three Jungians and Peter Bogdanovich discuss dreams , movies , and the unconscious mind .

" <p> " I ca n't , " I say , folding up the piece of newspaper . " I have to visit my brother . He 's in the hospital . " <p> " Is n't your brother a famous screenwriter ? " she asks . <p> Of course , she would know this . Everybody knows this . <p> " Yes , " I answer , feeling a familiar mix of pride and fury overtake me , as it always does , at the mention of my brother 's career . <p> " Does n't he have a major award ? " she asks , teasingly . <p> " He has two of them , " I say , holding out my fingers like a peace sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . " Am I being rude ? " <p> " It 's okay , " I tell her . " Everybody 's interested . It 's interesting . " <p> " But poetry is interesting , too , " she says by way of begging my forgiveness . And I do forgive her . Most people , people you would least expect , too , can not control themselves from some shameless expression of the bottomless hunger my brother 's success inspires . <p> " You 're just being polite , " I say . <p> " No , I swear , " she begs . " I 'm a poet , too . " <p> " Let 's split a huge piece of carrot cake , " I say . <p> " Yes , " she says , and begins to tell me about her plans for the summer . <p> " I want to be decorous this summer , " she tells me . " I want to wear just the right skirt and beautiful , strappy sandals , and I want to go sit somewhere outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if I can be both the subject of my own narrative and the object of someone else 's narrative . " <p> " Good plan , " I say . I actually do know what she 's talking about , arranging yourself to be part of the landscape , but I do n't remember having a postmodern take on the subject , or any take on the subject . I do n't remember thinking at all . I remember feeling and behaving , and that my skin was especially thin . <p> I look up to see Walter making his way down the sidewalk . He looks extremely strange out here , in public , in the daytime , the sun on his shiny brown hair , and then familiar  --  I know his loping walk so well , and the way he swings his arms  --  and then he looks strange again . I turn my head and shield my face with the dessert menu , but it is too late . <p> " Libby , " says Walter , standing beside our table , " Libby , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuffy will come back , " I say . I notice that Kit is looking at Walter 's feet . That 's Walter . He 'll look perfectly normal until you notice the odd detail . In this instance , his shoes , men 's brown oxfords , are without any shoelaces . There is also the absence of socks . <p> " Who is this person ? " says Walter , looking at Kit with his big , unblinking eyes . <p> " My friend , Kit , " I say . <p> " Hello , " she says . <p> " Can I sit down here , too ? " he asks . <p> " Walter , ca n't you see I 'm having lunch with someone ? " I say . I can see that Kit looks puzzled by the harshness of my tone . <p> " It 's okay , " says Kit , her face now lit with devilish curiosity , " sit down . " <p> " No , " I say . " Walter , you should leave now . " <p> I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reason , hides her face in her hands in order to disappear altogether , until Walter turns around and leaves , walking back in the direction he came from . <p> " That guy lives next door to me , " I explain before Kit can ask . " We both feed the cats in the alley . " <p> " He 's cute , " says Kit . <p> " Weirdo , " I say , circling my index finger in the air around my ear in the universal sign for crazy person . " I try to stay away from him . " <p> I find I am extremely tired . Whatever exhilaration I had felt at the novelty of being awake for lunch , and being out during the day , and talking about life is gone . If I lay my head down on the table in front of me , I 'm sure I would fall asleep . <p> The cake arrives . I ca n't even taste the frosting , which is the main reason I eat this cake . <p> " What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Someone stole them , " I say . <p> I arrive at the hospital to find a priest sitting by my brother 's bedside , gathering up a scattered deck of playing cards . <p> " This is Father Donovan , " says Gary . I know the various expressions on Gary 's face , better than I know any other thing in the world , and I have never seen the look that is on his face right now . He is beaming . Goofily . " Father Donovan is my new AIDS buddy . " <p> " Oh , really ? " I say . In all of his years with the disease , Gary has angrily rejected anyone who has come calling bearing the title " AIDS buddy . " <p> Father Donovan , on his feet now , extends a hand . He is a handsome man of about thirty-five , with dark brown hair and startling blue eyes . <p> " You must be Libby , " he says . He takes my hand in both of his and squeezes warmly , like an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look exactly like Montgomery Clift , in I Confess ? " Gary says . " Look at that jaw . " <p> " Does Father Donovan know that you often rail against all games as a waste of time ? " I say to Gary . <p> " It 's true . It 's true , " he tells the priest , laughing , merrily . " I do that . I rail against all games as a complete waste of time . " <p> " The cards were my idea , " says Father Donovan , releasing my hand . " I 'm teaching your brother to play poker . He 's going to be quite good , I think . " <p> Gary makes a crazy face , eyes bugging out , tongue hanging slack . " Look , it 's my poker face , " he says . They hoot . <p> " Did you tell Father Donovan that we were raised by atheists ? " I say . <p> " He does n't care , " says Gary . <p> " I do n't care , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out laughing like a couple of ten-year-olds . <p> " So , there is no talk of God or anything ? " I say , plopping myself down in a padded armchair . Father Donovan finally returns to his seat . Most men do n't do that anymore , stand until the lady is seated . I never knew how much I missed it until this moment . <p> " Shhh , not a word , " says Father Donovan , his finger to his lips . <p> " Good , " I say , " because my brother gets very agitated by spiritual beliefs . " <p> " Not true , " says Gary , holding his cards in a dainty little fan . " I get agitated by fledgling spiritual beliefs , especially those cobbled together from a mishmash of bogus influences . I do n't like the pick-and-choose incoherence of it . I say , ' Choose a religion , a real one , and stick to it . ' " <p> " How about Catholicism ? " I say . <p> " There 's a fine choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Gary . <p> We turn to Father Donovan . <p> " I 'm not saying anything , " he says . " Not a word . " <p> " Then what do you two talk about ? " I ask . <p> " Fag stuff , " says Gary . " Musicals . " <p> " Love ' em , " says the Father . <p> But the merriment has now exhausted Gary , and Father Donovan begins to pack up his cards , gently lifting Gary 's little fan from where Gary has laid it down on top of his rasping chest . <p> " Please , " says Gary , wearily , " let me keep this hand till next time . I seem to be very attached to it . " <p> " Shall I say ' God bless you ' ? " he asks Gary . <p> " Libby , you have to hear the way he says it , " Gary says , softly . " It 's so elegant and sincere , not like a talk show host or some cheesy celebrity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bless . ' " <p> Father Donovan smiles . With his velvety black eyebrows , he does look like Montgomery Clift in I Confess , only not as tortured or pained . That dark Montgomery Clift cloud is not hovering nearby , the cloud of a secretive past , and the many sins that must be hidden forever . <p> " Say it , Father , " Gary says . " Please . " <p> " God bless you , my children , " he says , genuflecting , and I feel as though I have just witnessed the perfect expression of something too fragile to name . <p> And then Father Donovan is gone . <p> " I can see it in your face , Libby , " Gary says . <p> " See what ? " <p> " He 's a priest , and nothing is going to come of it , right ? " <p> " Get some sleep , Gary , " I say , feeling stupid and scared that this is all I ever have to say anymore . <p> " But I 'm dying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come of anything . " <p> I get off the subway and walk toward my apartment with a growing awareness that a crowd is beginning to accumulate in the middle of my block . <p> When a bicycle falls from a sixth-story window , at first I decide it must have something to do with a movie that has been shooting here and there in the neighborhood . Some trees on our block have been painstakingly affixed with lifelike-looking leaves in fall colors , like brown and orange . People , including myself , stop to touch the leaves , which turn out to be made of surprisingly strong plastic . <p> The bicycle seems to fall forever , its wheels spinning crazily , while the frame appears to float , suspended there . When it lands , it does so with a comical little bounce . It rides itself down the sidewalk for a yard or two , before it finally careens into a garbage can . It is Walter 's bike , I see by now , the one that hangs on the wall of his apartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else will come flying out of the window . The bicycle is followed by an old record player and a number of record albums which go hurtling wildly in all directions . They fly like Frisbees . They smash into jagged , black pieces . <p> I watch like everyone else . The police arrive , followed by an ambulance , and people begin to make comments about how somebody forgot to take their medication . Two women behind me wait for the next item to fall while talking about local preschools and Starbucks coffee . <p> Clothes go flying . Shirts , sweaters , socks . Pants are especially comical , hollow legs flapping frantically as they go . Weight-lifting equipment is not so funny , and neither is a brand-new television , and people scatter , covering their heads with their arms . And then nothing else falls from Walter 's window , and the window sits there , open like a mouth struck dumb , waiting for the words to come . <p> Suddenly Walter appears in the window , naked and screaming . It is a shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark of the pubic hair . He screams , shouting out , until he is grabbed from behind and pulled inside . The screaming , the terrible screams , like the cats in the alley when it rains , stops as abruptly as it had begun . <p> It 's not true that I have never thought about my fingerprints wearing off . But then I was told that the belief that one 's fingerprints are wearing off is a paranoid delusion , and eventually I stopped thinking about it . It has been years . Finally , it has been many , many years . <p> Two beefy men in blue escort Walter from the building . He is wild-eyed , barefoot , and dirty-looking , covered only by an old towel wrapped around his waist . <p> I remember Gary 's face when it appeared beside my hospital bed , distorted with concern , but there beside me , recognizable among strangers ' faces , more recognizable than my own . <p> " Walter , " I say , as I break from the crowd , lunging forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have held clutched to my chest . I am reaching for his hand . <p> Do I know this man , they want to know , and I keep reaching out for Walter 's hand . Do I know him ? they ask . <p> <p> By Elizabeth Tippens <p>
