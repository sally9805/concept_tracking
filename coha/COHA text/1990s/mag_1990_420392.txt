Section : CROSS CURRENT VIEWS <p> In October 1945 , the World Federation of Trade Unions was launched at a congress in Paris . It united trade union confederations from capitalist America , communist Russia , labour Britain , liberated France and eastern Europe , from social democratic Scandinavia , unions from Latin America and from countries that later would be called the Third World . <p> After the various attempts since Marx 's First International in 1864 to bring together the world 's trade unions into one international body , it looked forty-five years ago as if the deed had been done . The creation of the WFTU was welcomed publicly by trade unionists of all ideologies . The president was Sir Walter Citrine , Britain 's Trade Union Congress general secretary . The WFTU general secretary was Louis Saillant , a young official of France 's CGT ( General Confederation of Labour ) , who had risen to prominence  --  and to a warm fraternalism with French communists  --  as a resistance organiser for labour during the war . <p> This November , the WFTU will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little celebration of its forty-five years ' existence . There will be no delegates from the TUC , or Scandinavian or American unions . The seats once occupied by the communist unions of East Germany and Czechoslovakia will be empty . Certainly , WFTU members from countries such as Vietnam , Iraq , Cuba and Ethiopia , where unions are under control by the government , will be present but even the host country , the Soviet Union , is wracked by internal divisions and splits in its once monolithic trade union movement . <p> Many observers feel that the WFTU will reduce . even close down , some of its operations and that the body designed to unite world labour in 1945 will have little choice but to admit that it has run out of purpose . <p> For students of the Cold War , the WFTU is a fascinating paradigm . Set up to bring together communist and non-communist unions , it fell apart as the Cold War gathered in intensity . In 1949 , the western unions led by the TUC walked out of the WFTU and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So like NATO and the Warsaw Pact , the ICFTU and the WFTU were locked in rivalry between the 1950s and the 1980s , the former representing western-orientated unions , the latter , unions in the communist bloc or unions , such as today 's CGT in France , which are intimately associated with the local Communist party . <p> Rival ideologies hurled insults across the divide . For some the ICFTU was a crude spear-carrier for western capitalism and used by the CIA , amongst other governmental bodies , to destabilise radical trades unionism in the Third World . For others , the WFTU was little better than a Soviet foreign policy front , infiltrated by the KGB and used as a conduit for Soviet funds to all sorts of undesirable anti-democratic organisations . <p> For the historian , the creation and then split of the WFTU in the years after 1945 provide some clues as to the origins of the Cold War . The first lesson that appears is the immense difficulty in constructing effective international bodies that can transcend national interest and work toward common goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be , the most internationalist of social organisations . Marx and Engels placed internationalism , the proposition that the worker had no country , at the very heart of their organising theses . <p> Lenin 's first major political act after seizing power was to create the Communist International . International trade union organisations for different industries were set up in the 1890s and exist to this day . Yet internationalism was ( and is ) one of the most baffling and problematic constructs for trade unions and parties of the left . The moral impulse that leads to solidarity  --  expressed , for example , in the support that millions gave to Nelson Mandela during his long years in prison  --  and the supposed material interest that links workers across borders against their capitalist exploiters are useful as sources of rhetoric but difficult to translate into continuing organisational or institutional practice that has real effect . <p> At almost any given crisis , the worker and his or her institutions has opted for country or has sought relief from oppression , poverty or weakness through an array of national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour internationalism melted into rallying behind king or kaiser . In 1945 , everyone celebrated a great international victory over fascism , but it was the co-joining of national efforts that won the war , not a sublimation of patriotism or nation-state into a common international cause . <p> Nowhere was this more true than for the unions . which in 1945 , in every country , found their position incomparably stronger thanks to the war than it had been in 1939 . It was upheavals in the organisation of the nation-state . the need for unions to promote war production in Britain and America . or the role of the unions in the resistance movements of occupied Europe , that had propelled them into positions of authority , massively increased membership and . in some cases , real power . <p> At the height of this identification and rise to power by unions within the nation-state , the founding of the World Federation of Trade Unions in 1945 represented a concept of internationalism that could not be delivered . In 1945. unions had national , not international interests to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WFTU quickly enough . On almost any issue that was raised divergent national priorities emerged . The French CGT wanted to help their Greek communist allies but the Russian WFTU representatives , adhering to Stalin 's agreement with Churchill placing Greece in British hands , refused to help . The European left wanted a blockade of fascist Spain but this was vetoed by British and American representatives in line with the policy of their governments . The Tunisian workers formed their own independent union and in 1946 sought WFTU endorsement : This was blocked by French communists who held that Tunisia was part of France and its workers adequately represented by France 's CGT . <p> The best-known reasons for the WFTU 's sundering were the division over whether or not to accept Marshall Aid . supported by western unions and opposed by the Russians and on the incorporation of the industrial international federations into the WFTU . The Soviets wanted a highly centralised federation controlling every aspect of labour international activity . They were adamantly opposed to the more pluralistic social democratic concept that , left some autonomy for individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal break points but the underlying reason stemmed from the impossibility of putting into institutional practice labour internationalism at a time when identification of unions with the nation-state was so overwhelming . There was also long-term incompatibility between Leninist forms of trade unionism and their democratic counterparts . <p> The first major split in the world trade union movement had taken place in 1920-21 when Lenin set up a Red International of Labour Unions in direct competition to the social democratic international Union confederation which had been relaunched in Amsterdam in 1919 . British shop stewards attending the Moscow conference when the decision was taken begged Lenin not to split the world trade union movement but he brushed aside their objections . Lenin wanted a Soviet International , loyal to revolutionary values and under Moscow 's control . Quickly enough in the 1920s and in 1930 , the Red International Trade Union , the Profintern , fell in line with Soviet national interests and followed every twist and turn of Stalin 's changing internal and foreign politics . <p> There was an absolute fissure between democracy and dictatorship which the WFTU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure tell us something about the difficulties of internationalism in the labour movement once it leaves the realm of speeches and seeks to become operational . The question now is whether the collapse of communism , combined with the internationalisation of the world economy can give rise to a new labour internationalism , free of the encumbrances that led to the WFTU 's failure and based on objective international needs of workers in different countries . <p> Certainly the conditions are there . The power of the nation state , to help its national labour movement is receding in the face of the internationalisation of finance , production , distribution and trade . The globalisation of capital requires a transnational response by labour . The end of the Cold War means that ideological purity tests are no longer applied to international contacts . There has been a growth of effective labour movement militancy in the last decade in countries such as South Africa , Brazil , Korea and Poland . While trade unions are not increasing their membership or power in the industrial countries of the North , they have extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South . The ICFTU now counts over a hundred million members without taking into consideration the unions in countries still under communist government control . <p> In the latter , there is a distancing from formal subordination to communist party control . Even in China , the workers stirred during the great democracy movement of May 1989 and it was their support for the students that forced Deng Xiao-Ping to send in the tanks . As he openly confessed , the one thing the Chinese communists would not have was the Polish example of independent trade union organisation , as that was the thick end of the wedge overturning the communist claim to rule , based as it is on being the representative of the majority working massess in the country . <p> In Britain , trade union internationalism has been given an immense boost by the labour movement 's discovery that the European Social Charter of Workers ' Rights could be used to promote trade unionism against the decade-long onslaught by the Conservative government and by employers . The TUC and its affiliates embraced Europe eagerly and sought linkages with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked an engagement in pragmatic transfrontier unionism and an enthusiasm for Europe quite different from the Little Englanderism of British unions a decade or so ago . <p> So forty-five years after the founding of the WFTU , the needs , possibilities and prospects for trade union internationalism are as strong in 1990 as they were in 1945 . Whether those who shape trade union international activity into the twenty-first century do so with more effect than those who placed their hopes in the WFTU in 1945 depends very much on what lessons they draw from its history . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : De Gaulle and fellow leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions celebrate its launch in October 1945 . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Sir Walter Citrine ( left ) in July 1936 with Leon Jonhaux and C.
