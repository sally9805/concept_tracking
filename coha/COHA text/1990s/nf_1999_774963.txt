Start with silly scares , the kind that would be laughable were they not advanced with utter seriousness by influential organizations , politicians , and news media . Promoted by the same means as other fears  --  and often to the same ends  --  they afford a comfortable entry point into the fear mongers ' bag of tricks . It becomes easier to recognize how we are bamboozled about serious concerns , having seen the same techniques at work in the promotion of frivolous dangers . // Scenarios Substitute for Facts // " There is no terror in the bang , only in the anticipation of it , " said the ultimate master of terror , Alfred Hitchcock . Fear mongers regularly put his wisdom to use by depicting would-be perils as imminent disasters . " They 're all around you , everywhere you drive , waiting to explode , " exclaimed an announcer at the beginning of ABC 's newsmagazine " 20/20 " in 1996 , devoted to what he called " a growing American danger  --  road rage . " Hugh Downs , the program 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences , he recast them as portentous . " How many times have you been bullied on the road , honked at or tailed , cursed at by another driver ? Maybe you 've done this yourself . Well , tonight , you will see again where this kind of aggression can lead , " said Downs , insinuating that viewers had already anticipated what Tom Jarriel , the reporter whose story he then introduced , was about to detail . // A seemingly innocuous beep of the car horn can lead , Jarriel said , to " anger so explosive it pushes people over the edge : fist fights , even shootings , between perfect strangers . " Out in the real world , people honk their horns all the time without getting socked or shot , but in the fluid logic of Jarriel 's narrative stark imagery and atypical anecdotes eclipsed reality . " It happens without warning to ordinary people , " Jarriel said , and to prove the point , he interviewed a man who was shot in the face after cutting someone off on a highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage in 1997 , used the same approach . First she transmuted familiar occurrences into a huge new danger . " We 've all been there . It starts out with the tap of the horn , an angry gesture , a dirty look ... , " she declared . Then she proceeded to recount a few actual incidents in which the outcome was a shooting or fistfight . That expressions of annoyance almost never intensify to a shooting or fight was beside the point . " This is a show that affects so many people , " she said , and then cleverly produced an impressive but ultimately meaningless number . " This woman 's biggest offense was pulling out of her driveway ... countless millions of you have done that , " she said in the course of introducing someone who had been attacked by another driver . // Journalists in the print media used a slightly different tactic . Call it the foreshadowing anecdote . After relaying the gory details of a particular instance of highway violence , they asserted that the given example " raises the overarching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " just the latest case of road rage ' to gain national attention " ( USA Today ) . A page-one story in the Los Angeles Times in 1998 declared that " road rage has become an exploding phenomenon across the country " and depicted the Pacific Northwest as a region particularly " plagued by a rise in road rage . " Only after wading through twenty-two paragraphs of alarming first-person accounts and warnings from authorities did the reader learn that a grand total of five drivers and passengers had died in road rage incidents in the region over the previous five years . // An average of one death a year constitutes a plague ? The only other statistical evidence the reporter managed to muster was from a study released in 1997 by the American Automobile Association . Cited habitually in stories about road rage , the AAA study afforded reporters an opportunity to declare that incidents of road rage had " been rising 7% a year " ( Los Angeles Times ) , or as People magazine put it , " more than 50 percent since 1990 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings in proper perspective : a piece in U.S. News &amp; World Report noted that , of approximately 250,000 people killed on roadways between 1990 and 1997 , the AAA attributed 218 deaths , or less than one in a thousand , directly to angry drivers . And of the 20 million motorists injured during that period the AAA attributed less than 1 percent of those injuries to aggressive driving . // Big percentages do not necessarily have big numbers behind them . The dramatic " up more than 50% " statistic in the AAA study derived from the difference between two relatively modest figures : the number of traffic incidents that involved major violence in 1990 ( 1,129 ) compared to 1996 ( 1,800 ) . An increase of 671 incidents in fifty states over seven years is hardly " a growing epidemic " ( USA Today ' s description of road rage ) . Nor does it warrant the thousands of stories about road rage that appeared in print and on radio and television  --  coverage that helped produce the 671 figure in the first place . The AAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports , all of which are influenced by hype . The more talk there is about road rage , the more likely are newspaper reporters , police officers , and insurance agents to classify as examples of it incidents that they would have ignored altogether or catalogued differently in the past . // Psychologists refer to this phenomenon as the Pygmalion effect , in deference to George Bernard Shaw . In Shaw 's Pygmalion , Liza comes to appreciate that , as she puts it to Colonel Pickering , " the difference between a flower girl and a lady is not how she behaves , but how she 's treated . " Posits Liza , during an exchange with the Colonel , " I shall always be a flower girl to Professor Higgins , because he always treats me as a flower girl , but I know I can be a lady to you , because you always treat me as a lady , and always will . " // In the late 1990s police and reporters treated all variety of highway mishaps as road rage . One evening in 1998 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a car that had been sliced in half by a truck on a freeway . The fatal accident had been caused by the driver going up an exit ramp in the wrong direction , but reporters and highway patrol officers labeled it " another case of road rage . " Their justification ? Witnesses reported the driver had been tailgating a van just moments earlier . At the time she drove up the exit ramp and into oncoming traffic she was neither a perpetrator nor victim of road rage , but because she may have acted aggressively in the recent past the incident could be counted as road rage . // A few days after that incident , when an off-duty prison guard was shot dead on a freeway ramp , police and reporters described the event as " a random act of violence , like other examples of so-called road rage violence plaguing the nation 's motorists " ( Los Angeles Times ) . This time too the characterization was unfounded . The victim 's husband , who had been driving the car , let police know immediately after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of road rage . According to his account , their assailants had followed them from a shopping mall , forced them to pull off the road , and stolen money . It was when his wife pulled out her state corrections officer badge , the husband reported , that they shot her . Police later suspected the husband himself in the murder , but never was road rage a likely hypothesis . // Bad People Substitute for Bad Policies // Stories about road rage left little doubt as to what , or rather who , was Responsible  --  vicious strangers . Over the past decade or so police and reporters had warned of disparate new categories of creeps out to get us  --  home invasion robbers , carjackers , child nabbers , deranged postal workers . Now they were issuing an even broader warning . Everywhere we go are " strangers in their cars , ready to snap , driven to violence by the wrong move , " the announcer on " 20/20 " cautioned . Indeed , Tom Jarriel went on to suggest , " the most disturbing aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't choose who we drive with on the highways . " // In just about every contemporary American scare , rather than confront disturbing shortcomings in society the public discussion centers on disturbed individuals . Demented drivers rather than insane public policies occupied center stage in the coverage of road rage . Where reference was made at all to serious problems that drivers face , these were promptly shoved behind a curtain of talk about violent motorists . " Roads are more crowded all the time , which means more delays and more frustration , " National Public Radio 's Alex Chadwick reported , but rather than pursue the point with insights from , say , experts on mass transit , he quotes someone from the AAA who contends that driving " frees the beast " in people . // In USA Today reporter Patrick O'Driscoll notes that 70 percent of urban freeways are clogged at rush hour ( up 15 percent over the past fifteen years ) and that traffic exceeds road capacity in most U.S. cities . Did he then go on to consider possibilities for relieving the congestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Faced with tempers boiling over like radiators in rush-hour gridlock , police agencies are seeking ways to brand aggressive driving as socially unacceptable ... " // Rather than traffic experts journalists spotlighted police officials , who understandably took the opportunity to urge the hiring of more officers . Or reporters turned to so-called experts such as Arnold Nerenberg , a psychologist who dubs himself " America 's road-rage therapist " and runs a web site ( www.roadrage.com ) where he brags that he has been featured in dozens of TV programs and magazines . Not a researcher , Nerenberg nonetheless offers authoritative-sounding sound bites that support reporters ' portrayal of highway violence as personal pathology . " There 's a deep psychological urge , " he tells Newsweek , " to release aggression against an anonymous other . " Road rage is " a mental disorder that is contagious , " USA Today quotes him . In an interview with the New York Times , Nerenberg called on the American Psychiatric Association to add road rage to its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than half of the U.S. population suffers from the disorder , which Nerenberg described on ABC 's " World News Tonight " as " an adjustment reaction disorder . " // Such psychoblather only obscures what even Nerenberg himself knows to be the primary instrument of murder on the nation 's roadways . Asked directly by People magazine whether there is truly any difference between now and twenty years ago , Nerenberg allows , " One thing that makes the problem worse is that we have more Americans arming themselves . Millions of us illegally carry loaded weapons . The more guns in cars , the greater the chance they 'll be used . " // Most of the coverage of road rage , however , shamelessly disregarded the import of firearms , even though the AAA study found that offenders in road rage incidents often use guns to kill or injure their victims . On Oprah Winfrey 's show devoted to road rage the murder of one driver by another was recounted tearfully and in detail by the victim 's fianc ? as well as by the man who killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone mention that the victim would almost certainly have survived had there not been a gun involved . In fact , when Winfrey brought on the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , his only mention of weapons was metaphoric . He referred to cars as " three-thousand-pound weapons . " // Experts who do try to direct attention to the matter of guns seldom succeed . In a road rage story on CNN occasioned by a fatal shooting , the local district attorney counseled against " too many guns in cars " and made a comparison : " When you go to Canada , they ask you , Do you have any guns in your car , ' because you have to check them at their border . If you 're coming from Canada to this country , they ask you if you have any fruit . " Rather than pursue the matter CNN correspondent Dennis O'Hayer promptly shifted the focus . " Even if you do n't have a gun , your own driving tactics could be setting you up for a dangerous face-off , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta Constitution then proceeded to urge viewers against death-defying acts such as " getting in the left lane and holding up traffic . " // One of my initial hypotheses about why pseudodangers receive so much attention was that they provide opportunities to talk about , and perhaps rectify , problems too big to face in their totality . Stupefied by the quantity of guns on the streets , we might focus on doing something about the much smaller number in cars . My hypothesis could not have been farther from the truth . Pseudodangers represent further opportunities to avoid problems we do not want to confront , such as overcrowded roads and the superabundance of guns , as well as those we have grown tired of confronting . An example of the latter is drunk driving , a behavior that causes about eighty-five times as many deaths as road rage ( about 17,000 versus 200 ) . Close to half of all fatal traffic crashes involve alcohol , and three in five Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related crash at some point in their lives . Moved by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Driving , journalists had covered the issue of drunk driving in a sound and sustained way throughout the 1980s and early 1990s . Thanks in part to that coverage , the number of alcohol-related highway deaths plunged by 31 percent between 1982 and 1995 . Fatality rates fall twice as rapidly , studies find , in years of high media attention compared to those of relatively little attention . Intensive coverage permits passage of powerful laws , creation of sobriety checkpoints , and new notions such as the " designated driver , " all of which save lives . // Yet by the mid-1990s groups like MADD were finding it difficult to be heard in the media over the noise about road rage and other trendy issues . In the years that followed the fatality rate stopped declining . Polls taken on the eastern seaboard during the late 1990s found people more concerned about road rage than drunk driving . Who could blame them when they read in their local paper , " It 's not drunken or elderly or inexperienced drivers who are wreaking havoc . Instead , scores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers who have abandoned civil roadway behavior " ( Philadelphia Daily News ) . // The Power of Calling Something " P.C. " // If the first of those two sentences by Don Russell of the Daily News inverted the truth about dangerous drivers , the second misled more broadly still . Russell is one of several writers on road rage who alluded to the issue of civility . Reporters variously raised the matter themselves or quoted police officers declaring that " people have forgotten how to be civil to each other " ( USA Today ) . In so doing they exemplified another unfortunate hallmark of fear mongering : the tendency to trivialize legitimate concerns even while aggrandizing questionable ones . // Worries about Americans acting uncivilly toward one another date back at least to frontier days , and in our present era bad behavior behind the wheel is far from the most significant or pressing form of incivility . At a time when a disabled black man in Texas was beaten by racists then chained to a truck and dragged down a road to his death and a gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol-whipped , and left to die , we would do well to focus our sights on bigtime incivilities such as racism and homophobia . Instead we are diverted by willy-nilly references in stories about road rage , or worse , by fear mongers who intentionally set out to confuse matters . // One of the most effective scare campaigns of the late twentieth Century  --  political correctness on college campuses  --  was undertaken for the express purpose of changing the terms of debate about civility . The people who generated the scare did not phrase it in those terms , mind you ; they couched their alarmism in First Amendment language . In the late 1980s conservative commentators began warning of what they described as " the greatest threat to the First Amendment in our history " ( Rush Limbaugh ) , " the equivalent of the Nazi brownshirt thought-control movement " ( Walter Williams ) , and " an ideological virus as deadly as AIDS " ( David Horowitz ) . // President George Bush , in a commencement address at the University of Michigan in 1991 , put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " declare certain topics off-limits , certain expressions off-limits , even certain gestures off-limits . " Some professors and students were indeed urging that certain categories of statements and gestures be eradicated from university life . Specifically , they sought to do away with racist , sexist , and homophobic behavior . If anything qualifies as uncivil in a diverse society , they argued , it is precisely these sorts of acts . // People who got chastised as PC were trying to create a more respectful and inclusive environment on campuses for groups that largely had been excluded  --  a goal that conservatives could not attack head-on lest they lose the already limited support they had in minority communities . Besides , far from being First Amendment absolutists themselves , many conservatives eagerly support restraints on a range of behaviors , from flag burning to the display of homoerotic art . So rather than engage in honest debate with campus liberals and progressives , conservatives labeled them " politically correct . " Much the way their forebears had used the epithet " Communist " a few decades earlier , conservatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Primarily by means of anecdotes retold time and again in political speeches , in the news media , and in popular books such as Dinesh D'Souza 's Illiberal Education and Roger Kimball 's Tenured Radical , they created an impression of armies of PC militants occupying the nation 's colleges and universities . // Conservatives told , for instance , of a mob of 200 at the State University of New York at Binghamton who , armed with sticks and canes , invaded a lecture hall and threatened an elderly man who was giving a talk . According to pieces in the Wall Street Journal ( one of them titled " The Return of the Storm Troopers " ) , the university 's president did nothing about the hooligans because college presidents " live in terror of being politically incorrect . " // Then there was the story of a class at Harvard on feminist theory taught by Alice Jardine , a professor of French . According to Dinesh D'Souza , who sat in on the class one day , a student delivered " ribald one-liners about a man who lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the professor and other students . " // Almost invariably , after such stories came out witnesses to the actual events debunked them . Participants at the Binghamton event , as well as a campus police investigator and one of the speakers , reported there had been no violence . The entire incident consisted , they said , of a single student who engaged in disruptive behavior for about four minutes , for which the university placed him on probation . About the class at Harvard , Alice Jardine subsequently explained that the discussion of the missing penis was actually about the myth of Osiris , a deity whose body parts were scattered throughout Egypt . Osiris 's wife , Isis , buried each part as she found them . The phallus was never recovered ; images of it , which are used in festivals , can be bought at tourist shops in Egypt . // Yet information correcting the faulty reports came out mostly in academic books and journals , not in the mass media . The general public was left with a highly inaccurate image of white men being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities . // Granted , activists from the political left sometimes behaved with impudence or intolerance . Speakers were shouted down on occasion if they were perceived as racist , sexist , or antigay . The sum of those occurrences did not support , however , a claim that " the delegitimization , even demonization , of the white male has reached extreme lengths , " as Paul Craig Roberts of the Cato Institute , a conservative think tank , put it in an op-ed in the San Francisco Examiner in 1996 . Guilefully trading on the memory of the Holocaust , Roberts went on to assert that affronts to white males on college campuses are " comparable to ... the denunciation of Jewry by anti-Semites . " // Exaggerated assertions of that kind received more public notice than did the true patterns of discrimination and exclusion on U.S. campuses . Perhaps editors despaired of being called PC themselves if they ran the story , but there was an important story to be told . The data were rather shocking : on the eve of the twenty-first century women , blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the professorate , mostly hold jobs at lower ranks and with lower pay . At the height of the PC scare , in the early and mid-1990s , women made up less than one-third of full-time faculty at American colleges and universities , a figure just slightly higher than in 1920 , when women won the right to vote . Only about one in twenty professors was Hispanic or African American . // Research on students documented additional disturbing trends . Women and students of color often received less attention and encouragement in classrooms than did their white male counterparts , and outside of class they were the targets of tens of thousands of verbal and physical attacks each year . Gay and lesbian students likewise faced assaults , bigotry , and death threats . Even at famously liberal colleges gays and lesbians experienced prejudice . In a survey at Yale almost all gay and lesbian students said they had overheard antigay remarks , and one in four had been threatened . At Oberlin College nearly half of gay , lesbian , and bisexual students said they have to censor themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meantime , to be openly gay or lesbian at many colleges was to risk being denied tenure , promotion , and opportunities to move into administrative positions , research showed . // Smoke Trumps Fire // The PC scare demonstrates how an orchestrated harangue can drown out a chorus of genuine concern . Faculty and students would raise questions about inequities at their schools only to find themselves made into causes c ? l ? bres of anti-PC fear mongering. // Imagine how surprised people must have been at Chico State University in 1996 and 1997 , when just about every prominent conservative commentator took out after them . " Totalitarianism did n't disappear with the collapse of the Soviet Union . It 's alive and well on many American college campuses today , " wrote Linda Chavez in a column in USA Today in reaction to an event at the previously unnoticed California school . Her comment was typical of the commentary by conservative essayists . Reading them , you would have thought that Chico State was under some sort of military occupation . The conservatives in fact were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are seeking a dynamic classroom teacher ... , " the draft of an advertisement for a philosophy teacher had read . When a member of the university committee that reviews job ads questioned whether dynamic was the best word to describe the kind of teacher the program was actually seeking , the word was replaced by excellent . Some highly effective teachers do not have dynamic personal styles , the English professor had observed , and vice versa , some high-spirited teachers do not actually have much worthwhile knowledge . In addition , she suggested , the term dynamic may unintentionally discriminate against candidates from certain Asian and Hispanic backgrounds in which personal styles tend to be more unassuming . // Just about everyone involved at Chico State had concurred with the editorial revision , yet in the months that followed the editing of the ad conservatives took every opportunity to assail the modification as PC degeneracy . " This episode typifies the sorry state of higher education today : Academes are so afraid of offending people that they 're afraid to ask for strong teachers , " Debra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasted without bothering to explain her assumption that excellent teachers are not strong . In San Francisco 's other paper , the Examiner , Paul Roberts of the Cato Institute suggested that the secret plan at Chico was to exclude white men from faculty positions . " All qualifications are restrictive , which explains their de-emphasis and the plight of overrepresented white males in our brave new world of equal outcomes , " Roberts wrote . // By this point in the PC scare sense and sensibility had become optional . Once a pseudodanger becomes so familiar it ends up in the dictionary ( not to say the title of a popular TV show hosted by comedian Bill Maher ) , argument and evidence are dispensable . Indeed , in the late 1990s some of the best-known conservative columnists , no longer feeling obliged to diagnose particular incidents of political correctness in any depth , simply threw out bunches of ostensible examples . George Will , in a piece disparaging what he called " sensitivity-soaked Chico , " went on to complain about an entry in a mail-order catalogue for kindling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Even mail-order companies have to act PC , Will bemoaned , " lest the friends of trees have their feelings hurt . " John Leo , of U.S. News &amp; World Report , likewise included Chico in a laundry list of what he dubbed " p.c. crimes and misdemeanors . " His sardonic subhead  --  " Wanted : Lethargic New Teacher "  --  was rather mild compared to some others in the same column . Beneath the heading " Tired of Education ? Try Gender Courses " Leo warned that " p.c. folk " have been " working to replace useful college courses with dubious ones . " He cited as examples " The Politics of Dance Performance " offered at Swarthmore and " Christianity , Violence and Victimization " at Brown . // Both Leo and Will banked on the improbability that anyone would look into their examples . The courses Leo cited did not replace other courses ; they were added as electives . Nor did the courses represent dubious additions to the curriculum . A well-educated student of a particular art form ought to know something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion necessarily includes attention to dishonorable as well as glorious moments in its history . As for the mail-order catalogue  --  the company was merely trying to make an unexceptional product sound special , a common practice in direct marketing . // Success Does n't Come Cheap // If so many of their examples were untenable , how did conservatives engender such a successful scare ? How did it come about that politically correct , a phrase hardly used in the media prior to Bush 's speech in 1991 , appeared in the nation 's major newspapers and magazines more than 5,000 times a year in the mid-1900s ? In 1997 , the last year for which data were available , it appeared 7,200 times . // The short but not incorrect answer is money . Behind the scenes millions of dollars were spent to generate that level of noise . Right-wing foundations such as Coors , Olin , and Bradley , along with corporate and individual contributors , provided funding for a national network of organizations : such think tanks as the Cato Institute and American Enterprise Institute ; conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D'Souza got his start ; magazines such as William F. Buckley 's National Review and David Horowitz 's Heterodoxy ; and faculty groups , most notably the National Association of Scholars . With an annual budget in the vicinity of $1 million , the NAS had the wherewithal to provide politicians and the press with an unending supply of sound bites , anecdotes , and op-eds. // In an article in Skeptic magazine on what he termed " the great p.c. conspiracy hoax " Brian Siano of the University of Pennsylvania compared the strategies of the NAS to a national magazine that asks its readers to send in accounts of psychic experiences or sightings of flying saucers . Such a request would inevitably produce loads of testimonials . " One might be able to debunk one or two accounts , but the rest of this database would remain unchallenged , ' to be trotted out by the faithful as often as possible , " Siano suggests . " Now imagine , " he adds , " if you could spend a half dozen years and millions of dollars on such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The NAS continually collected reports of political correctness gone amiss , packaged the best , and peddled them to the media . Anyone who dared challenge the reports quickly discovered the power of NAS 's home-court advantage . In 1996 after USA Today quoted an NAS official 's assertion that Georgetown University , as part of a general " dumbing down " of its curriculum , had decided to drop Shakespeare as a requirement for English majors , the dean at Georgetown responded that the school was doing nothing of the sort . Georgetown 's curriculum for English majors includes more , not fewer , Shakespeare classes than in the past , he pointed out . Moreover , regardless of their major , all Georgetown students must complete twelve courses of general-education requirements , including two literature courses . This factual information from the dean did not appear , though , in the news story , but only later , in a letter-to-the-editor column . // When Robert Brustein , artistic director of the American Repertory Theater , picked up on NAS rhetoric and proclaimed that " most English departments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agendas that it is unlikely Shakespeare can qualify as an appropriate author , " journalists found the quote too juicy to resist . The image appeared widely in the press of PC thugs in ivory towers forcibly evicting the Bard . But when John Wilson , a graduate student at the University of Chicago , suspicious of the claim , consulted data from the Modern Language Association , he discovered that fully 97 percent of English departments at four-year colleges offered at least one course on Shakespeare . Almost two-thirds , he learned , required English majors to take a Shakespeare course . In the MLA 's on-line bibliography , Shakespeare received nearly 20,000 entries  --  more than three times the next runner-up ( James Joyce ) , and thirty-six times as many as Toni Morrison , reported Wilson . Wilson 's correction to the NAS and Brustein et al . appeared , however , in the Chronicle of Higher Education , the equivalent of a trade magazine . // To the extent that great literary works were being withheld from America 's youth , PC forces were seldom to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were people like the school superintendent in Maryland who banned Toni Morrison 's Song of Solomon in 1997 after some parents called the classic of African-American literature " trash " and " anti-white . " And they were conservatives in the U.S. Congress and state legislatures . " The real danger to Shakespeare , " Katha Pollitt accurately noted in The Nation , " is not that he will cease to be compulsory at elite colleges like Georgetown but that he will cease to be made available and accessible to a broad range of students . " Throughout the 1980s and 1990s conservatives slashed budgets at the National Endowment for the Humanities , the U.S. Department of Education , and other public programs . Among the unfortunate results of those reductions in funding , such places as the Shakespeare Theater in Washington , Shakespeare and Company in Massachusetts , and the Folger Shakespeare Library had to curtail programs that train teachers and reach wide audiences . // Conservative politicians had whipped up popular support for such cuts in the first place by  --  you guessed it  --  portraying the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supports Another // Once a scare catches on , not only do its advocates have the offensive advantage , as the Shakespeare follies illustrate , but they can also use the scare as a defensive weapon in other disputes . This chapter concludes with an important case in point , in which the PC label was actually used to countermand a scientific fact . // Anyone who commuted by bus or train in the Washington , D.C. , area during the mid-1990s or sought an abortion in the South in that period will probably remember this fear campaign . More than one thousand advertisements appeared in buses and subway stations around Washington and Baltimore alluding to a scary statistic : " Women who choose abortion suffer more and deadlier breast cancer . " In Louisiana and Mississippi legislators passed laws that require doctors to inform women twenty-four hours before an abortion that the procedure can increase their risk of breast cancer . // Some antiabortion activists had been pushing the point since the early 1980s , when it first became apparent that as the number of abortions rose in the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breast cancer also increased . Not until 1994 , however , did the news media pay much attention to prolifers ' fear mongering . That year , the Journal of the National Cancer Institute published an article in which researchers estimated that having an abortion might raise a woman 's risk of breast cancer by 50 percent . // To their credit , journalists were circumspect about the study . In contrast to coverage of some other pseudodangers ( road rage among them ) , the news media generally did an excellent job of putting in perspective the 50 percent figure . Reporters noted that other studies had found no increased risk , and that even if future research confirmed the figure , the import would be minimal for most women considering abortion . A 50 percent increased risk may sound large , but in epidemiologic terms it is not . It does not mean that if all women had abortions , half again as many would develop breast cancer ; rather , it means that a woman 's lifetime risk goes up by 50 percent . If she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would raise it to 15 percent . Heavy smoking , by comparison , increases the risk of developing lung cancer by 3,000 percent . Some studies suggest that living in a city or drinking one glass of alcohol a day raises the risk of breast cancer by greater than 50 percent . // Reporters generally did a laudable job the following year as well , when anti-abortion groups heralded two more studies . One estimated a 30 percent increased risk of breast cancer for women who have abortions ; the other put the figure at 23 percent . Journalists explained that both studies suffered , as had earlier research , from a potential reporting bias that could substantially skew their results . They quoted the lead researcher on one of the studies , the epidemiologist Polly Newcomb of the Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , who noted that women battling breast cancer might be more likely than others to inform researchers that they had had abortions . Cancer patients are more accustomed to giving full and accurate medical histories , Newcomb suggested , and they are searching themselves for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researcher on the other study in 1995 , an endocrinologist at Baruch College named Joel Brind , offered no such caveats . On the contrary , he told CNN , " The evidence is quite clear , in fact , it should have been out long ago . " Brind advocated that every woman considering abortion be informed of the potential increased risk of breast cancer . When reporters checked into Brind 's background , however , they learned that he is an antiabortion activist who contributes frequently to newsletters and web sites published by prolife groups . Richard Knox of the Boston Globe reported that Brind told him he had conducted the study specifically to provide legislators with justification for requiring doctors to warn women about a cancer risk . // With Brind as their medical mouthpiece , antiabortion groups intensified their scare drive throughout 1995 and 1996 . Some persisted even after a massive study published in 1997 in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that the earlier research had been flawed in precisely the ways Polly Newcomb and other experts suspected . Conducted by epidemiologists from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-reports but on data produced through the mandatory registration in Denmark of births , cancer cases , and abortions . The scientists were able to compare 281,000 women who had had abortions with 1.2 million others who had not . They determined that neither group was more likely to develop breast cancer . // Joel Brind 's rejoinder when a reporter from the Washington Post asked him to comment on the study ? " This is an apparently large and powerful study with the politically correct result that is not scientifically correct , " Brind said . At once reinforcing the PC scare and using it to defend another misbegotten terror , Brind vowed to continue his campaign of fear .
