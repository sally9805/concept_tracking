More than 1,000,000 U.S. teenagers become pregnant each year , most of them unintentionally . Approximately 416,000 have abortions , 472,000 give birth , and the rest miscarry . In recent years , the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) has increased and AIDS now poses yet another threat to sexually active adolescents . Concern about these consequences has helped transform sex education in the schools from a taboo topic into a national norm . About 60% of teenagers receive some sex education in school  --  with the overwhelming approval of the American public . Polls indicate that more than 85% of U.S. adults favor sex education in the schools  --  up from 76% in 1975 and 69% in 1965  --  and that parents of school-age children are even more likely than other adults to support such instruction . Moreover , large majorities favor the teaching of such sensitive issues as birth control and abortion in addition to such traditional topics as reproductive anatomy and pregnancy . According to a 1986 survey , for example , 77% of Americans believe sex education courses for 12-year-olds should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homosexuality and abortion should be covered . This broad support is reflected in the nation 's laws and policies . Forty states and the District of Columbia either require or encourage sex education ; even more support teaching about AIDS and other STDs ; and 32 states and the District require or encourage instruction on how to prevent pregnancy . The number of states that mandate sex education increased from four jurisdictions in 1980 to 17 in mid 1988  --  largely in response to the concern about AIDS and the availability of Federal funds to provide education about the disease . Support rests primarily on the assumption that it can be effective in reducing the negative consequences of early sexual activity . Most Americans tend to believe that students who take sex education courses are less likely than those who do not to become ( or get someone ) pregnant , more likely to practice birth control when they have sex , and less likely to get a sexually transmitted disease . Studies show that sex education increases young people 's knowledge and provides some evidence that teens who have received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also demonstrate that it does not encourage adolescents to initiate sexual activity , as those opposed sometimes charge . Thus far , however , they provide inconclusive evidence on its effectiveness in reducing unwanted pregnancies among teenagers . One reason the impact on adolescent behavior has been difficult to pin down is that little is known on a national basis about the content , quantity , and quality of the information imparted under the rubric of sex education . Surveys of those teaching high school sex education courses in 1978 and of superintendents of large city school districts in 1982 indicated that the components varied widely across the country , but furnished scant information about the actual content of classroom instruction . However , three 1988 surveys by the Alan Guttmacher Institute of sex education teachers and state and local education officials provide valuable insights into current teaching policies and practices for students in grades seven-12 , particularly in regard to prevention of pregnancy , AIDS , and other STDs . One included more than 4,200 secondary public school teachers in the disciplines most likely to teach sex education ; another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the District of Columbia ; and a third covered 162 of the largest school districts in the country . Five key findings emerged : * The vast majority of sex education instructors are teaching their students about abstinence from intercourse , birth control methods , use of condoms , sexual decision-making , and transmission of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases  --  in other words , those topics that can help students avoid unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases . * Almost all teachers think sex education is important and also believe that certain topics  --  such as birth control , AIDS , abstinence , and homosexuality  --  should be taught earlier than at present . * Eighty percent indicate they need more help in teaching about prevention of pregnancy and STDs , in the form of more and better factual information , instructional materials , and teaching strategies . * Sex education instructors frequently feel they lack the support of parents , the community , or their school administration , especially when they teach such topics as homosexuality , condom use , abortion , and " safer sex " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place greater emphasis on education about STDs and AIDS than they do on instruction about prevention of unwanted pregnancies or on sex education generally . Curricula , particularly at the state level , often do not cover issues related to teenage sexual activity . WHO TEACHES SEX EDUCATION AND WHAT IS BEING TAUGHT ? An estimated 50,000 public school teachers nationwide provide sex education in grades seven-12 . Most are drawn from five specialties : health , physical education , home economics , biology , and school nursing . About 60% are women . Most are experienced instructors : almost 50% are 40 or older , while half have been teaching for at least 15 years , including sex education for at least eight years . For most , however , sex education accounts for 10% or less of their teaching time . Almost all have taken some courses that specifically prepared them for the subject , but only three states  --  Michigan , Ohio , and Utah  --  and the District of Columbia actually require instructors to complete a course in human sexuality in order to be certified to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states and just over 50% of the large school districts have any certification requirement , and those that do usually mandate only that teachers be certified in a specific field , such as health or physical education . Sex education almost always is given as part of another subject , such as health , although education about AIDS sometimes is given separately . Schools offer an average of about 40 hours of sex education in grades seven-12 , of which approximately five are devoted to birth control and almost six to sexually transmitted diseases . Virtually all sex education teachers provide instruction about abstinence from intercourse , sexual decisionmaking , and transmission of AIDS and STDs . Most cover birth control methods , too . Condom use , homosexuality , and abortion facts and ethical issues are taught by large majorities of sex education teachers as well . Not all topics are covered at every grade level , however , or as early as teachers believe they should be . Most , for example , think that material dealing with STDs and pregnancy prevention should be included by the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion , and " safer sex " practices , by the end of eighth grade . In reality , these subjects frequently are covered later , since sex education is most likely to be taught in the ninth and 10th grades . Teachers ' concern that these topics be covered earlier reflects their recognition that many of their students are sexually active , especially in the higher grades , and their desire to provide instruction before too many are at risk of unintended pregnancy and infection . Their assessments of their pupils ' behavior are in line with statistics on adolescent sexual activity , which indicate that approximately one-quarter of American teenagers have had intercourse before their 16th birthday , which generally occurs in the 10th grade , and slightly more than half have done so before their 18th birthday . Encouraging their students to postpone sexual intercourse until they are older is one of the messages teachers are most anxious to convey . This is a position that belies the fear expressed by some that sex education chiefly is instruction about how to enjoy sexuality without becoming pregnant . Abstinence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method for preventing pregnancy and STDs . Nevertheless , teachers believe that students should be instructed to use contraceptives if they engage in sex , and 94% discuss birth control methods with them . Seventy percent include contraception as a part of their formal curriculum , while 24% discuss birth control only in response to students ' questions . ( The remaining six percent do not discuss contraceptive methods in class at all . ) When they teach about birth control , they generally cover the pros and cons of each method and explain how it works , but fewer than half tell students where they can get birth control paraphernalia . When they refer pupils for more information , they are most apt to send them to their parents , a family doctor , and/or the local family planning clinic . Almost all sex education teachers cover STDs . They are most likely to discuss AIDS ( 96% do so ) , gonorrhea , syphilis , and genital herpes . They are least likely to cover diseases that have gained prominence more recently , such as chlamydia ( only 63% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than gonorrhea ) , genital warts , and pelvic inflammatory disease . When they teach about AIDS and other STDs , sex education instructors usually provide information about the transmission and side effects of each disease . Through the 10th grade , they devote more time to STDs than to birth control ( excluding abstinence ) . In seventh grade , for example , teachers spend roughly two class periods discussing STDs and one explaining birth control methods . By 11th grade , they devote about three class periods to each topic . OBSTACLES Pressure from parents , the community , or school officials is the most common problem cited when asked what obstacles they face in teaching the subject . Despite the consistent expressions in public opinion polls of broad national support for school sex education among the public generally and parents specifically , one-quarter believe that neither parents nor local community groups support their efforts . Furthermore , about one-third think that their school administration is nervous about possible adverse community reaction , and nearly 20% believe that their school officials do not support them . It is unclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever the reality , teachers clearly see themselves caught in the middle between a desire to meet the needs of their students and a fear of alienating parents , community groups , and school administrators . Beyond a general sense of lack of support , many encounter  --  or perceive there to be  --  opposition to their teaching certain subjects , such as birth control methods , condom use , homosexuality , " safer sex " practices , and abortion . Yet , relatively few expect complaints over their teaching about such topics as abstinence , sexually transmitted diseases , or transmission of the AIDS virus . The states that recently have adopted policies requiring education about AIDS generally have not used the surge of public concern about the disease as an opportunity to update their sex education policies to reflect today 's issues and concerns better . As a result , state education agencies are far more likely to encourage local districts to provide instruction on abstinence or prevention of AIDS and other STDs than on prevention of pregnancy . The same pattern is evident in the policies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIDS and 68% require schools to provide sex education , but only 40% direct instruction on pregnancy prevention . Sex education teachers , by their own admission , often are not well-informed on many of the topics they cover . At least one-third say they need additional information about every topic they teach ; more than half want more data about STDs , sexual transmission of the AIDS virus , homosexuality , and abortion . The gaps in teachers ' knowledge about the birth control pill , which is the most widely used contraceptive method among teenagers , is a striking illustration of the problem . Three-quarters do not know that it offers protection against endometrial and ovarian cancer or that young smokers safely can use oral contraceptives . Only 16% are aware that pill use reduces the risk of some pelvic inflammatory diseases , and just one-third that its use does not have a detrimental effect on later fertility . Teachers ' lack of knowledge about the pill is especially troubling because almost 60% of sex education teachers develop some of their own instructional materials on birth control , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , there is no reason to believe they are better versed on other topics . Most indicate they want more and better teaching materials , especially on AIDS and other STDs , birth control methods , and abortion , as well as strategies to help them cover many of the topics in their curriculum . State education agencies and large school districts produce a great number of sex education curricula , but these tend to focus on the process of human reproduction , rather than on pregnancy prevention . For the most part , state curricula do not address either sexual activity or birth control . Those produced by large school districts are more likely to include contraceptive methods , and the vast majority cover the negative consequences of intercourse for adolescents . However , given their stated need for materials , the curricula apparently either are not getting into teachers ' hands or they do not find them particularly useful , probably because much of the material in them is out of date . If sex education is to be more effective in addressing the problems associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Teachers on the front line need help , but , for a variety of reasons , are not always getting it . State and school district guidelines often are vague or overly general  --  and sometimes even nonexistent . Theoretically , they are designed this way to give local school personnel maximum flexibility in deciding what is needed by and appropriate for their communities , but provide little in the way of support or guidance . A primary task for state-level policymakers is the development of unambiguous policies on sex education , and , for local school districts , the establishment of detailed curricula . The latter should be updated frequently to help teachers stay on top of the subject matter and to provide them with constructive ways to convey important information to students . Such revisions would have the added benefit of demonstrating the commitment of district authorities to effective sex education programs . Teachers also must have appropriate materials , rather than be forced  --  as they often are  --  to develop their own because of the limited usefulness or availability of the tools that do exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their school administrations , but of parents and the community as well . Public opinion polls have made clear that the support is there , but it appears to be passive . Active encouragement is required if secondary schools are to meet the sex education needs of their students now and in the future .
