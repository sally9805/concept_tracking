The beggar was in the ruins of London , leaning against the stump of a tree in the blighted field which had once been Hyde Park , watching the foreign conquerors parade arm in arm with trollops , and with girls who would not have been trollops had their fathers and sweethearts not perished in house-to-house fighting . And perhaps some of the girls were not trollops , the invasion was a year past , and the young have short memories . <p> The beggar shifted slightly , suppressing a moan . His absent arm and his blind eye had long since ceased to ache , but the loss of his leg was still fresh . Perhaps because he had lost it in defeat , it continued to trouble him . It was if the foot were present , each missing toe throbbing continually in phantom agony <p> Sensing him move , the ginger tomcat on his shoulder began to purr , and his parrot looked over from its perch on his empty cap . " Do your duty , do your duty , " it said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led by a servile Englishman . Soon he could hear the man 's voice , and recognized the broad nasal accents of his own native Norfolk . The beggar ducked his head and tried to appear asleep , leaning his face so that the cat obscured it . <p> " You there . Do your pets do tricks ? " <p> He sighed . Norfolk was a large county ; he could only hope that the man would not recognize him . He preferred to think that none who had ever known him could become collaborators . <p> " Aye , me lords , " he said . " Now Nappy , where 's Farmer George ? " He shrugged so that the cat jumped down . <p> The parrot began to strut , shouting " Hooray for Boneyparte ! Hooray for Boneyparte ! " Then it leapt upon the cat 's back and rode about contentedly . <p> The French officers laughed happily , and each tossed a coin into the cap . The Norfolkman bent down . " I knew a bird like that once  --  smaller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a lad . " <p> The collaborator stared at the beggar , his gaze dissecting away the tangled shock of white hair , the disgusting beard , the missing teeth , and focusing instead upon the long thin nose , the huge black eyes . He drew in a quick breath , his own eyes widening . <p> " I 'm done for , " thought the beggar . The thought was nowhere near so unpleasant as he had expected . After losing the last battle and his leg , his hope had been of vengeance and salvation . But this year of wandering had buried any hope , even that of escape . <p> The Norfolkman said , " No , the parrot I knew had some yellow to him , " and whispered before he drew away , " Darcy . Pemberly . " <p> That night some roughs came and took his coins , dealt him a few blows for no good reason , and tossed his crutch away for the sheer pleasure of watching him crawl after it . Nappy and Farmer George had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched their master 's new humiliation with impassive eyes . <p> The beggar did not care . He raised himself upon his crutch and hobbled back , whistling for his pets . He had a destination now , though he had no idea where Pemberly might be , or what manner of man Darcy . But for the first time in a year he had more to his life than pain and the shadow of inchoate yearnings . <p> And so , smiling , a green Indies parrot upon his left shoulder , a flearidden orange cat curled in his lap , Horatio Lord Nelson , Viscount Bronte , Knight of the Bath , Commander in Chief of the Channel Fleet , fell asleep and dreamed of battles that would never be and of others that would never end . <p> Two months later he arrived at Pemberly . The nights had turned cold , and he knew that if he did not find refuge here , he would not survive the winter . <p> The village was surprisingly prosperous , as if bypassed by the war and the blockade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruffling the hair of a child , and he felt unreasoning hatred for these simple country folk . In Norfolk , in Yorkshire , even in Scotland and Wales , those wild lands with the least claim of loyalty to their Hanoverian king  --  there guerrillas fought a war that was vicious and unrelenting . In the ports and harbours of England , old men and boys halfheartedly rebuilt burned out shipyards and raised scuttled vessels , all that had been left by the Navy and merchant ships which even now set forth from colonial ports under the guidance of the exiled Prince of Wales . England still ruled the waves , she just did not rule herself . But here , now , it was if the war had never occurred , and the Frenchmen were the invited guests of Mad George . <p> He stopped by the pump , drank his fill , then cupped his hands for his comrades . The parrot stood upon the cat 's back to drink , and they soon had a small audience for their small performance . <p> A pair of French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tres amusant , " said one . <p> " He must come with us , " said the other . " The fair Elisabeth appreciates oddities . " <p> They mounted their horses , nervous Thoroughbreds who were obvious booty from the stables of some Englishman of taste . " You there , " an officer called . <p> Nelson looked blank until the fellow spoke to him again in English . " You there , beggar , come with us . Madame will give you dinner and a place to sleep . " <p> Nelson nodded and tugged on his hat in a crippled imitation of servility . He whistled . Farmer George 's sole trick was to leap up to his shoulder . As ever the cat managed to make it seem he had done it of his own accord as well as a great favor to his master . <p> The Frenchmen rode slowly , admiring the fine hedgerows and fertile fields where they soon intended to hunt , while Nelson stumped along behind . They were entirely unaware that he understood them , and probably would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will like Elisabeth , Jean-Paul , but remember  --  she will not award you her favors . I believe she is holding out for the emperor himself . " <p> " Perhaps he 'll let me search her . " <p> Nelson gritted his teeth and gripped his crutch more firmly , longing to dash out the man 's brain . The casual joke encompassed a tragedy which had struck him as severely as the fall of his country , and even now made his one good eye see through a crimson fog . Emma . His beautiful Emma . She had gone to Bonaparte in the guise of a lover and the role of an assassin , and had met her fate at the guillotine which had replaced the gallows at Tyburn field . While she died in futile bravery , he skulked anonymously about the country , senselessly preserving his life . Emma had died in a vain glorious gesture for her country  --  and now she was reduced to a sniggering policy of caution . <p> " Elisabeth may set her sights high , " the Frenchman continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishwoman , of course , will sleep with anyone for a dram of gin , and not be worth the price . ' <p> Once more , Nelson 's fingers tightened about his crutch . What beneficent God would reduce him so , and now force him to smile as the women of his country were denigrated ? Nappy chanted again , " Do your duty , do your duty . ' <p> " The sisters , tell me again of the sisters . " <p> " Ah . Les belles filles Bennetts . Jane is the most beautiful , but she is faithful to her boring husband Bingley . Mary is a bluestocking ; any man who tries to seduce her will die of boredom . Lydia , though  --  ah Lydia . " It was clear from his lascivious tones exactly how friendly Lydia might be . <p> " She is a widow , and you know how they are . Kitty , now , she is malleable and will do what she sees others are doing . " <p> " I see . " said Jean-Paul . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one question ... " <p> At the name Darcy , Nelson 's heart began to beat faster , and not merely from the exertion . <p> " Where might be Monsieur Darcy ? " <p> " You must ask Elisabeth , she says it so amusingly . How foolish he acted , she will say . Did he not know how interesting and entertaining we soldiers of the Empire would be ? It certainly served her husband right , to refuse us hospitality and to be shot instantly dead . " <p> One may toss a bucket overboard , a bucket of slop , of blood , of fine wine . It does not matter . It will strike the water , spread forth and in seconds dissolve entirely , no trace of it remaining in the grand , cruel ocean . So it was , then , with Nelson 's last hope . <p> Sometimes , in the grip of extreme hunger or fatigue , he felt his mind slip into a delirium the equal of those which had tormented him during his various tropical fevers . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come upon him once more . He was in charge again of the fleet , but this time the invasion force did not slip past him in the fog , as had previous French fleets at Alexandria and Toulon . This time he did not sate his fury upon empty vessels , nor send Hardy and the ships to Brighton to rescue whom they might while he and his marines hopelessly pursued the vast army on land ... <p> This time he came instead upon the fleet a mile off Portsmouth , and set his own ships amongst it , pell mell , without regard to the line . Cannons exploded , ships burned and he gave no quarter , listening to the screams of drowning men and horses , while in reality he walked a sunlit path , smelling late autumn roses and hearing the song of the mockingbird . <p> In his mind he had fought not only this battle but others , his tactical sense and his rage so heightened that , did he only think he might go to some harbor without being recognized and captured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies , might meet up with his men again and command a fleet  --  then he should be the invincible arm of terror and destruction . Then no Continental ship should ever leave its port , no ship at all touch shore upon his besieged island home ... <p> And to what avail , even in his dreams ? He who was thought dead and was as good as such ; no hero in hiding , to save his nation . Only a crippled and sun-touched old sailor , masquerading as a buffoon for so long that it no longer seemed a masque . <p> His reverie ended at the finely wrought gates of Pemberly . The great home , like its village , seemed untouched by conflict . Perhaps more horses had once graced its stables , perhaps famous pictures and crystal chandeliers no longer decorated its halls . No matter , it seemed whole and inviolate . <p> The only curiosity was a building beside the stable , its equal in size but with walls of canvas . Odd sounds emanated from the massive shed . <p> " Philippe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , echoing Nelson 's silent question . <p> " Did I not tell you that Elisabeth loves oddities ? She has given refuge to a genuine ancient eccentric , who is building ... " Here he paused to laugh , and could barely continue , " ... building a balloon that will travel to the moon . " <p> " But that is absurd . It could not fly high enough ... " <p> " Ah yes , but he uses chemicals rather than hot air , and ... " Again he interrupted himself , this time with a fit of ungentlemanly giggling ... " and he will harness birds to it , and they will pull it to the moon ! " <p> " Oh dear , " said Jean-Paul . " And so if the lovely ladies take us hunting , as you said they would , then we will be slaying the steeds of this noble effort ! " He , too , succumbed to merriment . <p> And so , reflected Nelson , I seek refuge with a woman whose sense of cruelty delights in allowing madmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome . <p> Farmer George and Nappy performed their act at the doorstep for Madame Darcy and her sisters . The women were indeed beauty incarnate , wearing fashionable gowns of simple , sheer silk that were testimony to their collusion with the enemy . They watched with vague ennui , never gracing Nelson with more than the briefest of superior glances . <p> The lady of the house then ordered her butler to take the beggar below and bathe him  --  " Twice , " she added imperiously  --  and bring him to dinner . He protested , but her odd whims seemed to be law . <p> This , Nelson reflected , might be a danger equal to any he had faced since being wounded and finding refuge in the hidden cellar of a smuggler  --  a man who had made his living circumventing the law and profiting from the enemy , but who in the throes of invasion proved himself a better friend to his country than so many who had adhered to the conventional path , and ultimately dying a more virtuous death than many . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed in coat and breeches which must have belonged to the late and apparently unlamented Mr. Darcy , but he refused to he shaved . Examining his now trimmed coif and beard in a small mirror , even he could barely recognize his famous features , sunburned and lined with illness and fatigue . Still he took pains to rearrange his hair so that it stood at odd angles , and to put the neckerchief in disarray . <p> Dinner was a bizarre yet festive occasion , so great a feast that one would not suspect the nation to be under the yoke of a dictator , the people staving from the thievery of the conquerors and from the half-successful blockade of the remnants of their own Navy . <p> Madame Darcy had placed the French colonel at the head of the table and flirted with him shamelessly and relentlessly , though with an undercurrent of coldness that signified a resolution to maintain her virtue . Her sister Jane and husband Bingley were bluff English gentry , polite , hearty , and entirely ignorant of the fact that they were engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently the widow of an Army captain who had died in service , was even more the strumpet than the Frenchman had implied , and her sister , Kitty Bennett , seemed to possess that lack of discrimination which was common to the animal for which she had been named . <p> The final sister , Mary Bennett , was actually engaged in reading at table . Beside her sat an ancient wearing an ornate , outmoded long wig and a dressing gown . who babbled on to himself about something called chymical economy . Occasionally Mary would look up from her book and address a question to this Lord Henry . and then their conversation would become so abstruse as to seem to be conducted in a foreign tongue . Madame Darcy 's father . Mr. Bennett . finished the party . an oblivious gentleman who did not seem perturbed by his daughters ' scandalous behavior . <p> No one at this table of ignorance . licentiousness . and madness spoke a word to Nelson . He thought back to his meals with his sailors . and tried to behave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers or a knife , downing his watered wine in a single gulp . And indeed . after a year of living upon the rude charity of the road . he did not have to entirely feign the manners of a starveling . <p> He ate in fear of committing some error which might call attention to the reality of himself . His identity itself must be safe . for he was presumed dead . His boatswain , after entrusting the care of his parrot to the wounded admiral  --  or perhaps it had been the opposite  --  had taken Nelson 's blood-stained coat and attempted to sell its wealth of medals . Eager French officials had known it immediately to be a relic of the missing Nelson ; the boatswain had then bragged of stripping the coat from a corpse hastily tossed into some mire , and held to this brave contention even to his death . <p> But while no one would suspect this pitiful beggar of being the late commander in chief , surely they could recognize him as a fugitive gentleman . Investigation would then identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing squad , or slowly and visibly with farcical trial . Or most likely , and most detestable , he would be pardoned in a humiliating show of magnanimity to the fallen nation , to be kept as a crippled caricature of his former dignity . Kept as a house pet , fed and groomed and brought out at state dinners to shout " Hooray for Boneyparte . " <p> " Has your cat lost as many lives as you ? " <p> Nelson started back to the moment . Miss Mary Bennett was speaking to him . Whatever d'ye mean , milady ? " <p> " It is said that a cat has nine lives . You have obviously had a number of misadventures , losing your leg and your arm . Your right eye would also seem to be weak ... " <p> He cursed it silently . It did not appear scarred or shrunken as did so many sightless eyes , but the damned thing had lately taken to wandering . <p> " ... and that scar you attempt to hide with your hair is most impressive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely gray and your age not so very advanced-fifty , I should judge  --  bespeaks a life of action ... " <p> " Sister , " yawned Elisabeth Darcy , cutting short the disquisition . " You are wont to experiment thoroughly with boring subjects , and as such have quite lost the ability to be entertaining . Philippe here has been telling us that the emperor will soon come to residence in the city , and you would rather hear the sanguine life story of an accident-prone drunkard . " <p> And so the table was instead regaled with news of the imminent resumption of the social scene . Madame Darcy ended dinner with the announcement that she would , indeed , winter in London , and enjoy the opportunities of which the metropolis provided . Next the gentlemen called for brandy and the women briefly retired , and Nelson was escorted to a windowless room with a cot , where his pets awaited . He was instructed to remain there , no matter what he might hear . <p> He woke after midnight to the sound of an opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crutch . Farmer George , foolish beast , began to purr as he always did upon half-wakening , and Nappy , now off his best behaviour , squawked . " Do your duty men . Do your duty . " <p> A figure stood in the doorway  --  Madame Darcy , with her hair down now , and clad in a simple muslin gown which gleamed ghastly in the light of a candle . <p> Marvels abound , thought Nelson . Did her interest in oddities thus include their amatory prowess ? He had been celibate for a long time , at first with a sailor 's tired stoicism . Then his mistress had been executed and his wife Fanny , determined not to be outshone even in death by her rival , had succumbed in some equally foolish show of resistance . In this act of sublime stupid bravery she had been joined by his step son Josiah . who had saved his life at Tenerife ... And with the deaths of those women he had loved had died also any carnal longings . <p> Nor did he think his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of his spirit . willing to acquiesce to any erotic adventure . But Madame Darcy was lovely and spirited , if devious and cruel . And if such a woman was of a mind to seduce this wretched bit of humanity , he doubted not that she would possess the means to bring him to the mark . <p> She slipped into the room , closing the door , and waved the candle at his eyes . " As I thought . " she said . " The right does react less swiftly . You are blind in that eye , are you not ? " <p> " Ey , mum , this ai n't done now ... " he whined . <p> " Enough . " She spoke as one used to command . " I observed you at table . Your ill manners were most well done , but I sensed the inner battle against proper behaviour . You are a gentleman , are you not ? And a man blind in his right eye , absent his right arm , with evidence of a serious head wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail might end . " Missing me left peg , too , mum . " <p> She waved dismissively . " One can not expect things to remain static . Sir , I must know  --  are you Admiral Nelson ? " <p> He sighed . It was over . " That I am , madame . At your service . " He waved his left arm in a parody of a flourish , unable to bow as the scene demanded . <p> To his surprise , she fell to her knees , clasped his hand in hers , and raised it to a face now glistening with tears . " Oh milord , how I have prayed for such a happenstance as this ! " <p> She led him through a house strangely active , then outside . It seemed that half the yeomen of the district were present . " Will you not wake the Frenchmen ? " <p> She laughed . " They think themselves exhausted by Lydia and Kitty , but in truth it is Mary 's botanicals . " <p> The studious sister , leading out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laudanum and extraction of ... " <p> " Later , sister , " sighed Elisabeth Darcy . They passed men practicing with rifles . When one is constantly entertaining hunters , the lady explained , it was only natural that some weapons and charge might disappear , and be put to better use . <p> They came to the huge shed . The canvas had been drawn up . A strange vessel rested there , a framework of light wood above an open boat . Four similar craft sat behind it . <p> " What then , do you need my knowledge to invade the moon ? " <p> " No , " replied Madame Darcy , " to invade London . " <p> She turned and curtsied " Lord Nelson , your fleet awaits . " <p> In reality , his fleet was nowhere near ready . The moonboats were not , as Nelson had feared , mere balloons harnessed together . Rather than hot air , they relied upon a heretofore unknown substance which Lord Henry Cavendish referred to as dephlogisticated air , which he formed of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " Miss Mary Bennett took pains to inform Nelson , " is the man who weighed the earth . " <p> " A boon to humanity I am sure , " he replied . But he was pleasantly surprised the first time he took his flagship up . It veritably sprang into the air , angered at restraint , and reaccepted the ground only grudgingly as the odd gas was returned into storage vats . <p> " Did I mention , " asked Lord Henry casually as he flew with Nelson one night above the trees , " that dephlogisticated air is remarkably inflammable and will explode upon any contact with fire or lightning ? " <p> " Musket fire as well ? " <p> " A direct hit to a gasbag would prove fatal , " the desiccated old man replied . " I trust that I have placed the bags high enough , and sealed them adequately , to prevent the sparks of our own flints from igniting them . But one must lack certainty without the opportunity of direct observation . " <p> Ah well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines , had risked it himself . No one who had ever witnessed such a conflagration  --  the awful roar , the instant extinction of hundreds of men  --  no one could forget such a sight . Yet one still sailed into battle . <p> There was much to do . Before teaching the crews , Nelson had first to devise methods of flying . It was a bit like sailing , in that one was at the mercy of wind and weather , but it differed in the addition of the vertical . <p> Long sails might be extended laterally from a ship , to aid in steering . These might even be manned as oars , if the ship were to become becalmed . <p> The crew , when aloft , wore ropes about their waists in case of turbulence . Nelson had a set of leather belts with which he strapped himself to a forward strut , whence he might survey both the ship and the path ahead . From this odd perch , jutting out somewhat like a figurehead , he could see sepulchral wisps of cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hedge and sparkling ribbons of water . At times it seemed almost inviting , calling to him to step away , to fly freely ... And then he was glad of his bonds , like Odysseus tied to his mast , listening to the song of the siren maidens . <p> There were signals to devise , and marksmen to train . His sergeants in this were a pair of poachers known as the Wheat brothers , Dick and Rees , unruly men who could hide in a tree and shoot a rabbit through the eye . This seemed a valuable talent , and soon Nelson was sending all his new marines into treetops , both to impart to them the skill of shooting accurately downward , and to steel them to heights . His men were armed with rifles , which gave them some small advantage  --  they might accurately shoot three times the distance of a French musket . But those French muskets , of course , outnumbered them by the thousands . <p> There was no lack of volunteers . Madame Darcy 's collection of oddities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all pretending to be farmhands . Nelson 's own lamentable cover identity was Mad Tom the human scarecrow : on pleasant days he stood in the housegarden and waved his crutch at birds . It was a humiliating performance that he found himself entering with no qualms , to the extent that he sometimes abased himself further , to earn a coin from an amused French visitor . <p> He began each night as a beggar , rag-clad , red-eyed . Yet as he entered the shed and passed amongst the shadows of the moonboats he became a different man , standing straighter , pain ignored , voice deep and resolute . Those who laughed at him by day took his orders by night , and wondered to themselves who their new admiral might be . <p> And so he would find himself in the helm of a moonboat , snapping commands to the boys as they ran aloft in the riggings  --  for other than the few old soldiers designated for boarding , and the indispensable Wheat brothers , it seemed best to have lightweight crewmen . This allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury of lining the underside of the balloon casings with a padding of burlap  --  sufficient , it was to be hoped , to prevent musket fire from piercing the bags and igniting the dephlogisticated air . <p> One cloudy night he determined to take his men up all together , to practice some vague concept of formation flying . The surveyor was complaining bitterly  --  he had just finished painting figureheads upon the boat , carved wood seeming an excessive weight , and the paint was not yet dry on Nelson 's flagship , the Electra . The name amused him , as he remembered his triumphs in the Agamemnon . <p> He had thought himself immune to surprise , but as he donned an extra coat  --  for it was cold aloft , and cloaks tended to become entangled in the rigging  --  he saw the five Bennett sisters approach him , scandalously attired in breeches and jackets . <p> " Ladies ! " he said " We do not embark upon a pleasure voyage . " <p> He did not share the superstition that women were bad luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had yet to invent new superstitions suitable to the airships . <p> " This is not a cruise , " agreed Elisabeth Darcy . " We have always intended to captain these ships ourselves . We are smaller even than your village lads , we are familiar with London and its troop dispositions due to our recent journey of reconnaissance . And if we are ignorant of seamanship  --  why , so are the men of this county , and all humanity is equally ignorant of airmanship . To further my qualifications I am also , as you are no doubt aware , the general as it were of the Free Patriot Army of this part of England . " <p> He actually had not been aware , but it did explain some of the surreptitious visitors and odd meetings he had noticed . It also explained his old shipmate 's message to him . " But ... " <p> " And besides ... " said Lydia , a dueling pistol appearing suddenly in her hand . She aimed at a rat which was skulking in shadow toward the stables . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the rodent fell twitching . Lydia smiled , her small teeth gleaming ferally in the moonlight ... " And besides , our solicitous French friends have turned us all into crack shots . And we are , I do not blush to say , utterly ruthless . " <p> He had some question regarding that  --  he had seen Jane cry over a wounded sparrow , and thought Mary might be quite distracted from combat by the sight of an interesting toadstool , but he did admit that Elisabeth and Lydia had the makings of diligent and stern warriors , and that Kitty might be relied on to do whatever the others did , only more vigorously . <p> " Very well , " he said . " But be warned that , as admiral of this fleet , I shall not temper my language or orders out of regard for your sex . " <p> " Be certain you do not , " snapped Elisabeth , and she and her sisters each betook themselves to the helm of a moonboat . <p> Mr. Bennett tended to be somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was often heard to say , " If Lizzy believes it correct , I shall abide by her decision . " He spent most of his days in the nursery , supervising the education of the various tiny Bingleys , Darcys and Wickhams who were trotted out intermittently after meals or on sunny afternoons , and were otherwise kept in seclusion . <p> One day Bennett came to Nelson 's small room . One of Nelson 's periodic fevers had recurred , and he lay drenched in sweat , sipping bitter quinine and hoping that he would recover in time for their proposed action upon Boxing Day , or weather not permitting , upon the New Year 's day . It seemed wise to attack when the better part of their foes , complacent with garrison duty , would be obtunded from holiday celebrations . <p> As always when his master had a fever , Farmer George hovered closely , delighting in the heat and adding his own feline warmth to Nelson 's discomfort . <p> " Brought you something , Mad Tom , " said Bennett , with a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , held clueless suspicions regarding Nelson 's identity . <p> " Thought you might like it , " he continued , and held up an antique scarlet uniform coat . " My great uncle 's . Ca n't have you going into battle dressed as a beggar now , can we ? Meaning no offense , of course , " as he recalled that the man was a beggar . <p> Nelson thanked him . It did suit his purpose . His crew were to wear no signs of identification , to aid in their escape should such be necessary . He , however , lacking various limbs as he did , had no chance of escape , and would prefer to die in the uniform of his nation . Even a uniform some fifty years outdated . <p> They held their final conference on Christmas morning . The Yule log roared in the fire , and Cavendish rattled on a bit about the hazards of the explosive grenades he had concocted , the need to watch the temperature of the air in relation to the balloon 's ascension , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " And now , " said the aged scholar , " I believe I have finished my role in this comedy of patriotism . I have noticed certain properties in stationary bodies of water which make me believe it will be possible to weigh the moon , and I have delayed my investigations into this matter long enough . " He left the room , and only Elisabeth 's peremptory command kept her sister Mary from hurrying off to discuss this interesting mathematical question with the old gentleman . <p> " Very well , " said Elisabeth . They went over the plans again . The Free Patriot Army  --  a motley selection of allied individual groups which tended to the occasional act of terror or thievery  --  was to be alerted but only when the fleet was already above London , to keep any from suspecting trouble and rousing the troops . Their own men were to begin the day 's action , however , by silently capturing the semaphore stations which allowed messages to be transmitted across country at a shocking speed . They would send their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their action . <p> Mr. Bennett entered the room as they were ending their conference . " I had thought we ought to ask the vicar to dine tonight , and hold services for the holy day , " he said . <p> " It will not be convenient , Father . We have planed otherwise , " replied Elisabeth . " Tonight we leave to invade and conquer London . " <p> " If you think it advisable , Lizzy , " her father returned . <p> Then they went to prepare for the night 's action . Nelson allowed himself to be shaved , and his hair to be tied back with a riband . His cat , meanwhile , bathed in equal self-satisfaction , and the parrot groomed its feathers . <p> " We are , " he remarked , " the Spartan army , bathing and oiling that they might look well as they die . " It felt good to be back in uniform , even this foolish antiquated one , and to speak again in his own voice . <p> The troops seemed taken aback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railing of the Electra , uniformed , his gaze hard and steady , as the crews gathered in the twilight by the moonboats . The craft had taken on a full load of dephlogisticated air , and they strained against their bonds like cavalry horses eager for battle . He called for their attention . <p> " England expects every man  --  and woman  --  to do his  --  or her  --  duty . " <p> Elisabeth Bennett stepped forward . " My friends "  --  only a woman would exhort warriors so  --  " Tonight , with the Almighty 's help , we will liberate our captive nation , and free ourselves from the onerous and odious foreigners . And lest you doubt that God has already given us every sign of his favour , let me remind you that in our hour of need he sent us this man to lead us into battle . Sent us Horatio Nelson , hero of the Nile , Commander in Chief of the British Navy . " <p> Her troops exchanged astonished glances , then began to cheer . It was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson was able to restore order . <p> Then suddenly the damned parrot had flown onto his shoulder and was shouting , " Do your duty , do your duty . " <p> He was never sure what fool had set them loose , but the cat was there as well , scrabbling up into the rigging , and the parrot had flown amongst the gasbags . It would take too long to catch them ; they would simply have to come along . And when he stopped to consider it , they were in fact the only veterans of naval combat at his command . <p> " Set sail , " he ordered . High above , Nappy called , " Hooray for Boneyparte ! Do your duty ! " <p> The most astonishing thing about air travel was its utter silence . Floating now above the clouds , guided only by compass and the surveyor 's dead reckoning , linked by dark lanterns flashing code , they were alone in a world of black sky and white clouds . There were , to be sure , various creaks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the billowing sail , and the occasional odd beat of the mechanical wings as they corrected course , but in all the impression was of silence . They traveled within the clouds themselves , cleaving through the ghastly , fluffy field of white . The cold haze of the clouds was nothing like the salt spray of the ocean . But Nelson felt strangely at home . <p> The ships seemed to fly as if possessed , and the crews as well . Nelson found himself under constant scrutiny , village lads looking at him with what could only be termed worship . When the Meryton came alongside , he even surprised Mr. Bingley , ( acting as second in command to his wife ) with a similar expression . The jaded , familiar voices of the Bennett women , immune to hero worship , were a relief . <p> " You should not have told them , Captain Darcy , " he said to Elisabeth . She was perched high in the prow beside him , telescope at the ready . " They now feel themselves invincible . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waterways was remarkably quick . They were over London within hours ; odd how one disregarded the stench of the place when one approached slowly by land or sea , but how it struck one almost physically as one floated down gently from above . <p> Until now , if seen at all , they must have been considered part of the clouds . As they began to draw lower they would be apparent to those below . Nelson suspected , however , that most who noticed them at this hour would be drunk , and the rest ( he hoped ) disbelieving or awestruck . <p> Their good luck was , indeed , unbelievable unless ( as Mistress Darcy would have it , and Nelson might once have been inclined to accept ) God was for them . They hovered far above the Tower of London . <p> " If Bonaparte is not there , we are done for , " said Nelson . <p> Elisabeth , peering below with her telescope , made an impatient sound . " Remember the cowardice of the man . He could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , I have had intelligence from within . " <p> One could hardly argue with that . Nelson nodded . Perhaps he should give some new , bold signal to his fleet  --  but he had not the heart . <p> Instead , he signaled for commencement of their plan . The Electra and Boadicea were to land , whilst aboard the Boyle , Mary Bennett would discover whether the grenades were truly effective by dropping them upon the guardhouses . Nelson hoped that there were not many Englishmen amongst the French , then shook his head quickly . If so , they were collaborators , and deserved what fate might overtake them . <p> The Beryton and the Canada contained the bulk of their sharpshooters , and were to stay above , offering covering fire . <p> Nelson sighed , slipping free of his restraints and wrapping his arm about the post . He was about to land in the enemy stronghold , he was beplumed and dressed in an absurd outfit of bright red , he could not run  --  one might think him nothing but a target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the quarterdeck during melees , dressed in his every medal , seeming to dare the sharpshooters to take him ? Best to do battle in the same manner he always had before . <p> They were halfway down-landing was always a bit unsettling , the ground rushing up beneath you , your stomach lagging a good ten paces behind , and the hope that the illiterate blacksmith 's apprentice piloting the ship had judged the descent properly , lest all come to resemble a pudding dropped from a bell tower  --  when a guardsman looked up and began to scream . <p> Nelson heard a sharp retort , and saw the guard fall . " Never has so much been owed to a handful of poachers , " he thought . Around him , rifles began to fire . His men had the advantage . He saw the Wheat brothers calmly take aim and fire , lads behind them reloading , while the terrified French soldiers could not even reach the ships with their musket fire , which then tended to return to them ... But then they had fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " screamed his bird . <p> " Get above , you idiot , " Nelson cursed , and immediately swore again , as he felt sharp claws dig into his shoulder . The terrorized Farmer George was moving on to his accustomed refuge . <p> The surprise unbalanced him entirely and he pitched backward , but not before hearing a musket ball pass far too close . It singed his scalp and tore the unfortunate cat off his shoulder and into eternity . Another had died for his sake  --  and if the cat had not surprised him , it would instead be he who had been sent to greet his forebears . <p> Elisabeth skidded down beside him . " Admiral ? Are you ... " <p> " Damnation ! Help me up , " he said . He was bleeding , but this time it mercifully poured over his blind eye , leaving his vision unencumbered . " Then see to that lad . " <p> That lad was beyond help  --  a belly wound . But deferring his own medical help in favor of the sailors had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . <p> There was an explosion , and great gouts of flame leapt up beyond the wall . Evidently Cavendish 's inventions had succeeded again . <p> The Electra thumped to her rest upon the ground , Nelson barely retaining footing . The crew was half off already , screaming and drawing weapons for close fighting  --  a few swords and cutlasses , more pitchforks and scythes . " For England ! For Nelson ! For George ! " they shouted and their admiral , a bit concussed by the bullet , wondered if that final cheer were for his cat . <p> Then he was out of the moonboat , hobbling furiously for cover . Soldiers were approaching from the opposite side of the ship . Elisabeth turned , smiling with narrowed lips and eyes , and shot directly into the central airbag . The dephlogisticated air exploded , destroying the Electra and taking out the majority of the pursuers . Still though , she had been a noble ship and he regretted her loss . <p> They could hear shouts and firing inside the Tower . As Elisabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English servants had fallen upon their foreign masters . <p> They met up with the crew of the Boadicea . Nelson watched as Lydia , a knife in her teeth and her blouse open to the waist in a remarkable display , put a bullet through a guardsman 's chest and a second bullet through another 's throat , then paused calmly amidst the carnage to reload her pistols . <p> They entered the Tower . He found himself lagging far behind , stumbling now and then over the body of a foe or friend . Once he rounded a corner only to find himself staring directly into the muzzle of a French officer 's pistol . Only then the man 's mistress smashed a chamberpot down upon his head . <p> " Thank you , madame , " said Nelson . Leaning against the wall , he was able to doff his absurd feathered hat . Of course , the parrot upon his shoulder made the gesture a bit less courtly . <p> " My pleasure , sir , " she replied , taking up the loaded gun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then he was in a large ornate bedchamber with his men ( and women ) holding guns outstretched on one side , and on the other Napoleon Bonaparte himself , clad in an astonishing saffron nightgown and surrounded by loyal guards . <p> " You can not escape , " said Elisabeth . Outside a building exploded . Damn ! Had they not expressly asked Mary to spare the magazine , of which they might have future need ? <p> " What will it be ? " Elisabeth continued . " Die now , and let your men fight on to keep the country ? Little good that will do you ! " <p> The emperor 's pudgy face contorted as he thought . What to choose , safety and surrender , or glorious death ? It was certain that , while he would ordinarily not hesitate to opt for the former , he was having unexpected difficulty with the choice . The man was not entirely without honor . <p> " I can not surrender  --  not to rabble , not to women , " he cried . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limping forward . He bent down and shook off his hat , then looked directly at Bonaparte . Would his famous profile , his well-known haunted eyes , reveal his identity despite the comic but blood-soaked costume and the parrot ? <p> Napoleon 's eyes widened and his jaw dropped in the moment of recognition . Then he smirked . " If I have been defeated , it has been at the hands of a dead hero . " <p> " My death , perhaps , was reported prematurely , sir , " replied Nelson . " May I have your sword ? " <p> Bonaparte gestured to his men to put down their guns , then proffered his sword , hilt outward . <p> Nelson smiled , and waved his hand dismissively . " I fear I can not oblige you without help . Captain Darcy ? " <p> And to the emperor 's eternal scandal , the woman went forward to accept the token of surrender . <p> At that moment Nappy began to squawk . " Hooray for Boneyparte , " he said . " Hooray ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed . He was obviously going to have to work on his pet 's repertoire . <p> It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single woman in possession of the gratitude of her nation must be in want of a husband . <p> Nelson , newly bandaged , having set guards about the castle and having supervised the incarceration of the prisoners and the sending of messages regarding the victory , as well as briefly paying his respects to his oblivious mad monarch , had been pleased to discover his own medals in the possession of the emperor . Their familiar weight gave solidity to the scarlet coat . All this exertion , far from tiring him , had exhilarated him . He found , also , that for the first time in a year his missing left leg no longer ached . <p> He located the Bennett sisters in a drawing room , finely painted though its decorations and the bulk of its furnishings had been removed as booty long ago . They sat demurely , pistols beside them , as the staff served tea . Jane was silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitty , one arm in a sling , was remarkably ebullient . <p> " It is settled then , Elisabeth , " she was saying . " You shall accept no less than the Prince of Wales . " <p> He sat , and allowed the captain of his late flagship to pour him a cup of tea . Nelson admitted that it did seem a good match . One felt that this year of fugitive adversity must have matured George , honing him from a dissipated selfish fop into a stern , dedicated patriot . Or so one , at least , hoped . <p> " And for Jane ? " That sister wiped away a tear . It was clear she would maintain deep mourning for at least a year . " Another royal duke ? " <p> " I think not , " said Elisabeth thoughtfully . " We shall need the royal dukes single , to induce treaties . So many sovereigns have marriageable daughters . " <p> " Allow me to recommend my executive officer and dear friend Captain Hardy , " said Nelson , entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and I 'm sure he has been promoted to admiral in my absence . " <p> Jane allowed that she might take it under advisement . <p> " Well , I want a duke , " said Kitty , and began to pout . " Foreign would do , just not from too far east . " <p> " And you , Mary ? " <p> The studious sister glanced up from a book of philosophy she had discovered in Napoleon 's bedchamber . " I suppose I shall have to marry Lord Henry . I do , after all , bear his child . " <p> This comment had the insalubrious effect of ending all conversation for the space of several minutes . <p> Then Nelson wished the ladies happy , and rose . He imagined he had more to do that evening , to ensure their safety until the Navy returned and the Army was reconstituted . <p> " Does no one intend to ask my future ? " asked Lydia suddenly . Nelson paused . " I had presumed , Captain Wickham , that you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career , as it were , of flight . " The new Air Navy would need experienced officers . <p> " Not enough , " she said , and rose to walk over to where he stood leaning upon his crutch . She took his lapels in her hands , and came very close . " Not enough to be a captain . I wish an admiral . " <p> Nelson felt a sudden odd weakness before her predatory gaze , and realized something else . For so long his life had been circumscribed by pain and want . And now , in his time of triumph , pain had retreated  --  and he felt the first stirring of that other long dormant phantom , of pleasure . <p> " It may yet be arranged , " he replied . <p> S N.
