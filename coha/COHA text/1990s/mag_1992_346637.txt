MUSIC <P> The Next Incarnation <P> Call them the ever-shrinking group . In their earliest days the B-52S were a quintet riding the new-wave crest , but the death of guitarist Ricky Wilson and the recent resignation of vocalist Cindy Wilson have dwindled the group to a trio . Still , as their seventh album , Good Stuff , demonstrates , their talent has by no means diminished . What were once " rapid-fire three-way vocals , " as singer Kate Pierson calls them , are now back-and-forth dialogues between Pierson and Fred Schneider . Familiar motifs abound : hot pants , UFOs and mother earth . The music on the album is just as colorful as its cover design , with lyrics full of sex and in-your-face politics . And , in true B-52s fashion , still as infectious , each tune inspiring a hip-shaking jig . <P> TELEVISION <P> League of His Own <P> Sparky Smith ( Joe Mantegna ) is a hotheaded baseball manager who loses his job with the Seattle Mariners and winds up coaching a squad of inept Russians . But THE COMRADES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bears . Shot in the former Soviet Union , the HBO film nicely mixes savvy baseball comedy with post-cold war satire : Sparky has to scrounge for equipment on the black market , holds practices in a cavernous warehouse and listens sadly to Voice of America broadcasts as his Mariners head for the World Series . ( It 's a fantasy . ) Mantegna is delightfully dour , and the film knows its capabilities : it does n't swing for the fences , but gets a lot of sharp singles . <P> THEATER <P> Rash Impulses <P> Without aiding Jesse Helms , might one advise performance artists that there are worthier topics than graphic details of sexual awakening ? David Drake 's THE NIGHT LARRY KRAMER KISSED ME comes from a radicalized gay who is too busy satirizing cruising in bars and gyms to define the thinking that shaped him . Josh Kornbluth 's RED DIAPER BABY is less ably performed yet livelier because it recounts a more exotic upbringing  --  as a son of doctrinaire U.S. communists . But Kornbluth barely hints at his own political evolution after an eye-opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing his virginity . Both off-Broadway shows squander serious opportunities in exchange for laughs or titillation . <P> CINEMA <P> Portrait of a Psycho in Blue <P> UNLAWFUL ENTRY is a movie just waiting to be denounced by some presidential candidate . It 's not completely anticop , but a desperate pol could read it that way . Rogue Los Angeles bluecoat Pete Davis ( Ray Liotta ) has some very weird ideas about protecting and serving Michael and Karen Carr ( Kurt Russell and Madeleine Stowe ) . He comes to investigate a burglary at their house and stays to hit on her and harass him , after Michael sees through his bulletproof vest of politesse to the psychopath beneath . Liotta 's chilly boyishness is hypnotic . Jonathan Kaplan 's film is a little distant and a lot manipulative , as it reminds some of us paranoiacs that you do n't have to be Rodney King to get more police attention than you really want or need . <P> BOOKS <P> Just for Kicks                @ @ @ @ @
