HE WAS A CHAMELEON : A PREPPY in a polo shirt one day , the next , an ascot-wearing European aristocrat . Andrew Cunanan , the 27-year-old San Diego gigolo who charmed older men into supporting his extravagant lifestyle , tried on identities as easily as other people change hairstyles . Over the years he posed as an aspiring actor , the successful owner of a building-materials company and the scion of a wealthy family with sugar plantations in the Philippines . On April 24 , just eight days before Cunanan disappeared , he told a group of friends over dinner , " Everyone has their own version of what they think I am . Nobody really knows the truth . " Until now , perhaps . According to his friends , Cunanan 's latest role is his most unexpected-that of an alleged spree murderer , whom the FBI added to its 10 Most Wanted list on June 12 . Despite a nationwide manhunt now entering its third month , Cunanan remains at large .

Despite a trail of clues , the FBI remains hampered by one crucial obstacle : Andrew Cunanan 's constantly changing appearance . Says Agent Bob Long , a spokesman in the FBI 's Chicago office : " Looking at the pictures of Cunanan from the past year and a half . . . you could almost think you 're looking at a different person .

" If he could have been born into a royal family , I thought it would have been best , " a close relative told PEOPLE , citing Cunanan 's taste for luxury . His intelligence also set him apart . He read the Bible at 7 , an entire set of encyclopedias by 14 , and eventually taught himself Spanish , according to the same relative . In turn his parents indulged him , giving him a new Nissan 300ZX for his 16th birthday and sending him to the exclusive Bishop 's School in La Jolla . Cunanan , who made no attempt to hide his sexuality , was " pretty well liked , " says classmate Richard Caleel , 27 , now a lawyer in Los Angeles , but he " put on airs .

( Modesto 's whereabouts are unknown . ) From 1992 to 1995 , Andrew paid part of the rent ( his father continued to send checks for the remainder ) on a San Diego condo that he occasionally shared with his deeply religious mother , and he began selectively dating older , wealthy men . " He was very articulate and informed , " says Nicole Ramirez-Murray , a gossip columnist for San Diego 's Gay and Lesbian Times . By the mid-90s , Cunanan had moved into the La Jolla oceanfront condo of millionaire businessman Norman Blachford , who reportedly supported him and took him on trips to Europe .

Still , in the area 's gay bars and nightclubs , Cunanan remained a social lion with a trademark bellowing laugh . " He liked to be the center of attention , " says George Kalamaras , manager of a Hillcrest restaurant where Cunanan continued routinely to treat friends to dinner . Yet according to his roommate , waiter Erik Greenman , 24 , Cunanan 's days were empty : he read , strolled idly and smoked cigars , then hit the bars every night after watching Jeopardy ! Finally , with his credit cards maxed out at $25,000 , Cunanan announced in April that he was moving to San Francisco after " taking care of some business " with a friend in Minnesota .

On Friday , April 25 , David Madson drove to Minneapolis-St . Paul International Airport to pick up Cunanan , whom he had dated briefly before breaking off the romance in 1995 . According to friends , Cunanan was still smitten , but Madson had come to distrust him . " He thought Andrew was a little shady , secretive , " says Laura Booher , 30 , who worked with Madson . " David did n't want to be alone with him . " That night , Madson took Cunanan out for drinks with friends , including attorney Monique Salvetti , 30 . When she talked to Madson by phone two days later , he told her that Cunanan had given him a gold Cartier watch-a gift that Madson , who was pushing Cunanan to do something productive with his life , considered " a bit much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That day , April 27 , Cunanan allegedly left a voice message inviting Jeffrey Trail-a friend from San Diego who had recently moved to the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington-to Madson 's downtown loft . Neighbors describe hearing a late-night argument . There , on April 29 , Trail 's body was found , wrapped in a rug , with a claw hammer they believe to be the murder weapon and Cunanan 's gym bag , which had .40caliber ammunition inside .
