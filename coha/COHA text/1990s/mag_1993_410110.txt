So you want to be hip , you want to go where the good skiers go , you want to be the envy of your friends , the talk of your office , the person everybody listens to back at your local ski area ? You want convenience , value , great skiing , superlative service , gnarly nightlife , excellent kids ' programs ? Then you want to ski where it 's hot ! You ca n't get much hotter than Sugarloaf , a huge mountain tucked away in the wilds of Maine . Last year the resort was up 21 percent in skier visits over the previous year ( which had also set a record ) . Why ? Start with great terrain : Sugarloaf 's Snowfields offer the only lift-serviced above-tree-line skiing in the East ; the rest of its trails provide bumps , steeps , or cruisers  --  take your pick . Add fine lodging : numerous slope-side condos with an excellent chairlift feeder system that gets you from your condo to the slopes . Mix in a well-designed base village with dining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good measure , throw in better-than-average natural snow , a super snowmaking system , extraordinary grooming , and a staff that lives and breathes service . Now you 've got one hot resort . To be hot , you also need mystique , and Sugarloaf has it . Just a little farther away , a little colder , a little wilder than the rest of New England , Maine conjures up visions of moose , lobster , fishermen , ruggedly independent loggers , and miles and miles of unspoiled wilderness . For more and more skiers , it also conjures up visions of snow-covered ski runs . Skiers hear stories of this big , brooding mountain towering over the surrounding landscape , and they have to come ski it for themselves . This combination of remoteness and excellent amenities makes Sugarloaf the nearest thing to a true destination resort in the East . Why has it taken skiers so long to discover this true skier 's mountain ? Because to be hot , you need more than just great skiing ; you need service , too . Only seven years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a so-so reputation . Then Sugarloaf 's new owner , Warren Cook , came along and told his staff the hottest thing about Sugarloaf shall be its service . Service means top-notch snowmaking and grooming . It means free adult ski lessons and health-club use for everybody renting a condo ( and that 's just about everybody at Sugarloaf ) ; it means giving beepers to nursing mothers who leave their children in day care . It means anyone can meet with management for skiing and breakfast on Sunday mornings . It means a concert every weekend , and it means a smiling , friendly staff wherever you go . Yes  --  great terrain is a key to being hot , but great service is even hotter . Not that Sugarloaf 's terrain is n't hot . Wrapped around three sides of the second-highest peak in Maine , Sugarloaf has scores of single- and double-diamond terrain up top , and lobsterpotfuls of intermediate cruisers and beginner trails down below , enough to make this a well-rounded family resort . One intermediate/beginner trail  --  Tote Road  --  starts on a gently angled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington and Katahdin to beginner skiers . If you want the true Sugarloaf experience , take the gondola to the summit and start on Front Face on the Snowfields  --  now covered with snowmaking  --  by making big GS turns around the tops of stunted trees sticking up through the snow . Ski to the top of Bubblecuffer , and throw yourself into its endless twisting fall line of bumps . Take the chair up and do the same thing on Skidder ( supposedly a reference , like all of Sugarloaf 's trail names , to logging terminology , not to what the bumps do to your skiing style ) , and if you 're still standing when you make it to the bottom , then you 're hot . You may die of exhaustion after skiing so much mountain , but you wo n't expire for want of food . There are nearly a dozen restaurants in the base village serving lunch and dinner . You have your choice from funky Mexican to elegant continental ; not a lousy , overpriced cafeteria among the bunch . ( There is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only one downside to a Hot Resort : If you want to go there , especially during peak periods , you 'd better make your reservations soon . <p>
