<p> " It is a great day , " a Palestinian in Amman said on Friday . " It is the first time we have hit Israel with missiles . " <p> Across the Middle East , most Palestinians support Iraq in the war . They cheer even an act as outrageous as firing missiles at civilians . <p> They speak with the voice of desperation , of defeat , of resentment . The Palestinians feel betrayed and abandoned by the West , especially by America . They lost their home , and the greatest world power has brought them no justice . <p> The feelings are real , and we have to understand them . But what a disaster it is for Palestinians to be led by those feelings into support of Saddam Hussein . Over many decades Palestinian nationalism has made crucial political mistakes . This may be the worst . <p> The fault lies with the Palestinian leadership . The P.L.O . has been ardent in backing Iraq since it gobbled up Kuwait . <p> Yasir Arafat , addressing a Palestinian rally in Baghdad on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies wanted to fight , " then I say welcome , welcome , welcome to war . " He said " Iraq and Palestine " would be " together , side by side . " When the war started , the P.L.O . executive committee condemned " American aggression . " <p> The folly of that position  --  the folly for the Palestinian cause  --  is understood by many Palestinian intellectuals . A leading figure among them , Walid Khalidi , makes the case in a pamphlet just published by the Institute for Palestine Studies in Washington . <p> " The principles violated by Saddam in his invasion of Kuwait , " Professor Khalidi wrote , " were the very principles from which the Palestinian cause drew its moral strength . The ' terrorist ' image that Arafat was so desperate to shed was only reconfirmed by a close association with Saddam after his invasion of Kuwait . . . . <p> " Even if moral considerations were not at issue  --  and they are  --  antagonizing more than half the Arab states , particularly those that have enabled the P.L.O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is hardly in Palestinian interests . " <p> Mr. Arafat had reasons to side with Iraq , Professor Khalidi acknowledged . He had outraged Syria and his own radicals by moving toward peace with Israel  --  and then had got little or nothing from the United States for doing so . Most Palestinians supported Iraq . But such reasons did not excuse the leadership decision , Professor Khalidi said . He wrote : <p> " The P.L.O . ' s failure to come out publicly , repeatedly and forcefully against the invasion of Kuwait and in favor of Iraqi withdrawal in accordance with the U.N . resolutions has gravely damaged its political credibility and international standing . " <p> There is one simple truth that any Palestinian leadership must understand . The hope of a national home for its people can not be based on threatening Israel , firing missiles at Israel , making Israel feel insecure . To the contrary , the only hope is in an Israel that feels  --  and is  --  more secure . <p> Realists among the leaders came to that conclusion quite a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Abu Iyad , who was assassinated in Tunis last week . One theory is that he was killed at Saddam Hussein 's instigation , because he opposed P.L.O . support for Iraq in Kuwait . <p> Israel has not made it easy for Palestinian realists . The Israeli Government over the last two years refused even to talk with any real Palestinian leaders . If the talks urged by the United States had begun , it would not be so easy now for Saddam Hussein to arouse Palestinians with his false claim to represent their cause . <p> But that recent history has been overwhelmed by war . Not only the right-wing Government of Israel but Israelis who wanted to make peace with the Palestinians will have in mind now who cheered when the missiles landed in Tel Aviv . <p> Can there be any renewed hope of Israeli-Palestinian peace after this war ? If there can , it must lie more than ever in American leadership . <p> When the United States sent the Patriot air-defense missiles and crews to Israel , it demonstrated in the most convincing way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by holding off on retaliation against Iraq , has earned credit in American opinion . The alliance is closer than ever . <p> If the war ends quickly and successfully , the United States will have every reason to try to patch up relations with the disaffected parts of the Arab world . It can do so on the security of its relationship with Israel  --  and perhaps even do so with the Palestinians , if their leaders understand .
