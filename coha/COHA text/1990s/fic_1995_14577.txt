ALICIA ( Another toast . ) To all that we 've refused to know . ( Sits , picks up a book . ) To wasted years . To love poems read too many times .

PEONY I 'm getting so pissed off . CELANDINE ( Still this odd gaiety . ) But phones are so capricious , little Peony . ( ALICIA begins laughing with her . ) Do you remember the phone endlessly ringing before the Sweet Sixteen party Father gave me ? My yellow silk dress with ribbons ? And all those handsome young men lining up to sign my dance card ? PEONY ( Using this speech as a weapon . ) Sure . And when they were n't dancing with you , they were kissing me under the porch . CELANDINE You 're making that up . You were only eleven . ALICIA She was precocious that way . CELANDINE My god ! You let this child run around with her skirt up to her waist inviting any man who came by It 's shameless ! Shocking !

( Takes up her knitting. ) p. 28 PEONY ( Circles around CELANDINE . ) Ma 's right , Celandine . I always loved men . Men and freedom , nobody telling me what to do . Why , I 'd run away every night if I could . I love that moment when you take off , just getting out of here . You 've got no idea where you 're going , or how , or if you 've got enough money . You never take a suitcase to slow you down , just a big purse with lipstick , comb , underpants , Tampax and condoms , because probably you 'll end up in some guy 's bed.You 'll meet him in a 7-11 over by the Doritos . He 'll be big and shaggy and kinda nasty-looking , with a cigarette or a toothpick hanging out of the side of his mouth . He 'll look you over and just say , " C'm on , Babe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother an hour ago and I should stay right here . But even thinking that gets you so excited , you follow him like a magnet out to his Harley , and the two of you go screeching down the Arizona highway to his shack in the mountains . He hands you a beer , but before you can drink it , he 's got you up against the wall and you fuck like crazy animals . After you 've done it everywhere in his tiny shack and you 're oily wet and wiped out , you get the giggles because you feel so free . And he says , " Wan na stay ? " but you say no.So you finish your beers , and he drives you all the way home just so you can run away the next night and meet a married schoolteacher in the supermarket . You do it with him in the back seat of his Saab in the parking lot while all the people are walking by and he 's whispering Shakespeare in your ear that makes you come about fifty times.Next night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he takes you to the bridal suite in Howard Johnson 's . He orders room service  --  champagne , cavier and snails . Which makes you feel nauseated but fancy . He wants you to dance for him , naked , in your sparkling heels . You do , and suddenly he 's all over you and showing you stuff you only heard about . When he takes you home , your whole idea about fucking is rearranged and you can hardly wait to run away again . p. 29 CELANDINE ( Stands and looks out " door . " ) I think it 's going to rain . There 's a moist feeling in the air . Hot and moist . ALICIA No . It 's dry as Death Valley out here . CELANDINE ( Dabbing at her face with handkerchief . ) I never perspire . Not for years .

ALICIA You did n't know me when I was young . I dripped with hope . Puddles , trails behind me on the floor . People followed me , dazzled , drowning in my hope . Inadvertantly , I was responsible for many deaths . CELANDINE I 'm sure . ( Beat . ) I think I shall freeze this melted butter and then sculpt it . PEONY I 've had it . ( Pours more wine for all of them . ) Wine . Then Saran Wrap . ( As she hands out wine . ) Some day I 'm going to go to town in nothing but Saran Wrap . p. 33 CELANDINE That 's revolting .

Why do n't we have a discussion group ? Literary criticism . We could begin with The Golden Bowl because it 's so minutely incomprehensible and work in circles . PEONY Let 's talk about men . CELANDINE Or . I know ! We need Mozart ! ( She runs off. ) p. 34 ALICIA You 're wasting time , tormenting your sister . Have n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment of death .

Someone to cook with , not chicken , but lobster thermidor , steak tartare , asparagus quiche . He holding the bowl and I the spoon , in perfect synchronicity .

I like to open doors , fires are clichd , poetry does not need to be shared , and I adore cotton underpants that make me look like a female wrestler . So I have no pressed flowers in fading photo albums . What if I get no love letters in blue envelopes and the phone stays silent and black . Why have a color phone when there is no man in your life ? What do I care ? I shall never have a broken heart or a vaginal infection . Men always disappoint you , and I choose to be disappointed with no one but myself . There is such freedom in this decision . I am finally an adult , responsible for my own existence .

They hold each other 's feet . ALICIA is not in the room . A giant spiderweb of knitted rope now is stretched diagonally across one corner of the room . The end of the web continues in a knitted line offstage . Perhaps we see ALICIA in silhouette , off , knitting . ) PEONY ( A weary voice . ) Celandine ? CELANDINE ( Also weary . ) Yes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't the foggiest . PEONY She never did it before . CELANDINE What do you mean ? She 's always knitted . Ever since PEONY But not ropes . CELANDINE That 's true . She knitted squares . Before this . PEONY Afghan squares . To make us afghans . CELANDINE So she said . Did you ever look in her closet ? No clothes . Just squares , piled to the ceiling . PEONY Hunh. p. 63 CELANDINE She 's getting peculiar . Do n't you think ? Her wedding dress and now a rope ? PEONY Listen . She could buy a rope . If she needs one . CELANDINE I suppose.if you knit a rope , it's.more personal . PEONY Why ? CELANDINE Well , anything handmade PEONY But for what ? CELANDINE Why would you knit a rope ? PEONY I would n't . I 'd knit a bikini . CELANDINE Of course . PEONY Or a jock strap . CELANDINE Really . PEONY To give to my lover . CELANDINE You are monomaniacal . PEONY I 'm what ? CELANDINE Obsessed . With one subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEONY But if you could. ? CELANDINE I can . I choose not to . p. 64 PEONY No , I mean , knit a rope . Why would you do it ? CELANDINE I would n't , Peony . Nor would you . So there is no point asking why in the case of either of us . ( She sits up , more energy . ) To ask why you would do something you would n't is like speculating about the number of angels that can dance on the point of a pin . PEONY ( Also sits up . ) Angels dance on pins ? CELANDINE No . That is precisely the point . ( Beat . ) No pun intended . PEONY Okay . So what we need to figure out is why Ma CELANDINE Exactly . PEONY ( Crosses her legs on table , sits facing front , thinking . ) You can tie people up . I 've enjoyed that . CELANDINE ( Same position as PEONY . ) Rope off a room . So no one could touch it . PEONY Tie yourself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tie a piece of antique furniture to the roof of a car . PEONY Lasso somebody . CELANDINE Hang birthday decorations from ropes looped back and forth across the ceiling . p. 65 PEONY You could hang someBODY . CELANDINE From a tree ? PEONY Or from the rafters . CELANDINE You could choke him first . PEONY Unless you wanted him to suffer more . CELANDINE Yes . PEONY And after , you could throw the body in a ditch . With alligators . CELANDINE You could . ALICIA ( Enters with knitting . She is now in all black , a long dress , perhaps a nightgown , and a black turban . ) It 's nearly dawn . CELANDINE ( Peering off to side . ) Is it ? ALICIA ( Sits . ) Birds woke me up . CELANDINE Did they ? ALICIA Spring gets them going . CELANDINE Spring ? ALICIA You did n't notice ? CELANDINE Oh , I must have . ALICIA Sleep well ? CELANDINE I would n't precisely call it sleep . p. 66 PEONY You took off your wedding dress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PEONY Hunh . How 's your rope doing , Ma ? ALICIA I knitted a few feet in my sleep . PEONY We 've been thinking . ALICIA Who ? PEONY Celandine and me . Just sitting here thinking . ALICIA Dangerous business , thinking . CELANDINE Not for me ! I think all the time . Higher thoughts , usually . PEONY She thinks about angels dancing on pins . CELANDINE No , that is exactly what I do not think about . I avoid that subject with the same passionate intensity that I avoid walking into Woolworth 's in Saran Wrap . PEONY She really likes that idea . CELANDINE What I avoid is anything useless that would n't help me to develop my spiritual side . ALICIA Oh . CELANDINE So , Mother We were thinking that the best use for a rope is to kill someone . p. 67 ALICIA Were you . PEONY Especially a hand-made rope . Because it 's more personal . CELANDINE And we were speculating that the most efficient and painful way would be to hang him from the beams in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from the central beam ? So his feet would dangle right over the table where you 're sitting ? CELANDINE ( Involuntarily looking up and shuddering . ) I do n't think so . Would you like to be eating our eternal chicken dinner and ? PEONY We could get so drunk we would n't notice . CELANDINE You would notice . You 'd bend over to cut yourself a hunk of broccoli , straighten up and his feet might graze the top of your hair . PEONY When you spray your hair as much as mine , you do n't feel a gentle touch . CELANDINE I was n't thinking gentle . Besides , there 's the smell . ALICIA You think a side beam would be better then . CELANDINE Oh , I do . Really . Now that we 've considered the subject from a rational point-of-view . PEONY How long do we have to leave him up there ? p. 68 ALICIA Long enough to make a point . CELANDINE To whom ? ALICIA Just a universal statement . But he has to come back first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That helicopter CELANDINE ( Staring at the rope . ) Mother , your rope seems to lead somewhere . ALICIA Does it ? CELANDINE ( Her eyes follow the rope back to the giant spiderweb . ) Look at that ! In the corner there . ( They all turn and stare at web . ) ALICIA No wonder I 'm tired . I seem to have been busier than I thought . PEONY You should n't do that , Ma . You need your sleep . CELANDINE That web is going to be very difficult to clean . And I 'll be the one to do it , no need to tell me . ALICIA Just leave it . It might come in handy . CELANDINE I doubt it . Perhaps if you took sleeping pills , you would n't do things like that . PEONY ( Pounds the table . ) How could he not come ? I heard him ! Right over the house . p. 69 CELANDINE He 's done this before , you know . ALICIA You noticed ? PEONY He promised ! CELANDINE Apparently promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot ! He cares about us ! ALICIA You have evidence ? PEONY Well , not recent . ALICIA How long , would you say , has it been since you had any  --  even slight  --  manifestation of his caring ? PEONY Come on , Ma . There were the letters and the ( Long pause . ) I do n't want to think about it . CELANDINE But perhaps we should think about it . We should focus our minds and allow some clarity ( She sits in an elaborate " thinking " pose . ) ALICIA How many presents has he sent ? CELANDINE Do n't bother me , Mother . I 'm thinking . ALICIA Any money ? Plane tickets to visit him in the last ten years ? CELANDINE Time is so nebulous . And when one is as busy as Father , it must be difficult p. 70 ALICIA I know what your father is doing . And why you have n't heard from him . CELANDINE Odd . When one has been thinking higher thoughts all her life , it 's difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he hasn'tsome incident , perhaps , when we made him.angry ? ( Long pause . ) Wait ! Something has finally come to me . Do you remember Peony 's ducklings ? ALICIA Yes , I certainly do . PEONY I do n't remember . CELANDINE Oh , never mind . It 's an unpleasant memory . Peony would n't want to hear it . ALICIA No , go ahead . PEONY What ? CELANDINE I take no responsibility . ALICIA That 's okay . I do . CELANDINE ( To PEONY . ) You were five , I think , when you found these eggs out by the pond and brought them home . PEONY I do n't remember a single thing from when I was little . CELANDINE Well , some duck mother had abandoned them in the grass . Perhaps she was killed and eaten by a fox . p. 71 ALICIA So you and your father built this wooden box with a glass top you could lift off CELANDINE And you put the eggs inside , wrapped in blankets , with a light bulb to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father said if you were careful and checked them every day CELANDINE That soon the eggs would hatch , and you would be the mother of your own baby ducklings . ALICIA You were so excited and proud ! Each afternoon , when you came home from kindergarten PEONY I went to kindergarten ? ALICIA Yes , at the little schoolhouse on Kings Highway . And when you came home , you would run in the door , toss down your jacket and the drawings you 'd made , and run to check the eggs . CELANDINE You 'd say , " They 're still warm ! When am I going to be a mother ? " ALICIA And your father would say , " Soon , very soon , you 'll have your own babies to hold and feed . " CELANDINE But one day there was a party at school and you came home late ALICIA And when you ran in the door to check the eggs , the box was gone . p. 72 PEONY Oh , no ! What happened ? CELANDINE The light had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother . ALICIA You shouted , " Where are my babies ? " And your father took your hand and led you outside , and there was the box , all broken , the glass lid smashed , and the eggs PEONY Do n't tell me . ALICIA The eggs were cracked open , the dead babies lying in the grass , their eyes still closed PEONY NO ! ALICIA And your father said , " You killed them ! " PEONY I did n't kill them ! Not me ! ( She is crying . ) No , I did n't do it ! CELANDINE Father was teaching you a lesson . Because he ALICIA Could have put in another light bulb and saved the babies for you . But because you were late , he assumed you were being irresponsible CELANDINE Well , she was . PEONY ( Wailing . ) I was only five ! CELANDINE Oh . Oh , yes . Now I remember . That 's what I said . What I screamed . " She 's only five ! " p. 73 PEONY I 'M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Yes , baby . Yes , yes . PEONY ( Still sobbing . ) I remember when he drove too fast and I was scared . Only him and me and snow all over . So I could n't see . Because it was night and slippery , those roads , turning , and I crawled in the back and got down on the floor CELANDINE He 'd been drinking . Had n't he ? ALICIA ( Rocking PEONY back and forth . ) Yes . PEONY But he yelled , " Get back in the front with me ! " And I did n't want to ALICIA But you did . PEONY Yes , because he screeched the car and we almost hit a tree , but the car stopped . And he waited . So I climbed over the seat and he CELANDINE He hit you . Did n't he ? He hit us , Mother . At least I think he PEONY And everything was dark and freezingOh , Ma . CELANDINE And whenever he came home , like that , I hid under the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? " I was so frightened , Mother , and sometimes he p. 74 ALICIA Sometimes he found you . CELANDINE No . I wo n't remember that . PEONY ( Sitting up and glaring at her . ) What did he do ? What ? CELANDINE That 's not part of my memory . PEONY CELANDINE , TELL ME . CELANDINE It 's the wrong memory . I made a mistake , I ( Dropping to floor . ) PEONY What do you mean ? CELANDINE ( Crawling to ALICIA 's feet . ) Absolutely nothing . PEONY You 're lying , Celandine . I know when you tell lies . CELANDINE How can you breathe ? Have you noticed ? When you have no mouth , you ca n't smell or hear.Everything 's gone . ALICIA I know . CELANDINE You know ? What do you mean ? ALICIA You can know something that you do n't know . Because if you know , you 'll have to do something . If you loved him , you 'd have to say , GET OUT ! How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew ! p. 75 ALICIA I was thinner than a broom straw . So delicate . I needed him , I had to believe . Life is so precarious , the floor could give way at any moment , a door you 've always opened is suddenly locked.or it disappears and there 's just a blank wall . How could I face that ? CELANDINE You could 've called the police . ALICIA My breasts were getting smaller and smaller . At night I could feel them dissolving . I knew after my breasts , my whole body would evaporate . CELANDINE If you cared for us at all ALICIA No one left in the bed , waiting for him . Because he did come to me , although he did n't quite see me . His mind was somewhere else when he was drinking . ( PEONY begins pacing around . ) CELANDINE You should never have been my mother . ALICIA I should n't have been anyone 's mother . And if I had n't , he would 've loved me longer . CELANDINE It 's a shame you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , if we had children , he And he did love me . He built this house for me . PEONY ( Kicks chair over . ) Look at it . It 's a piece if crap . p. 76 ALICIA He taught me to read poetry . And then every evening he insisted I read poems out loud while he made love to me . ( PEONY continues pacing . ) CELANDINE You should be executed . ALICIA He brought me books  --  Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky , Tolstoy , Camus , French and Latin grammars . All stolen out of libraries . CELANDINE Traitor ! ALICIA And he told me it was all right that I had no family , because he would never leave me . CELANDINE Executed in front of a firing squad . ALICIA I had no friends . I lived out here where the world ends and there was no news . There was no one to say , when I needed to hear it , " You can survive if he leaves you . " CELANDINE Without a blindfold . ALICIA So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , until I knew more than he did . He hated that , coming home and finding me sitting at the kitchen table late at night , conjugating Latin verbs . " What are you doing ? " he 'd say . And I 'd know that for those lonely hours my books had become my lovers . But after his anger , he 'd start caressing me PEONY DO N'T TELL ME THAT ! He brought me presents , because he loved me so much . He DID ! He told me , all the time he said such sweet things to me ! p. 77 CELANDINE Oh , Peony ! PEONY Okay , so when I was little he got mad at me . I screwed up . That 's natural , I was a kid . But later , I understood what it really was between us . ALICIA You did n't . And you still do n't understand . PEONY Oh , yes , I do ! He said he never loved you , Ma , only me , because I was cute and you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALICIA Shut up , Peony . CELANDINE No , I was the one he loved . I 've always believed that it was I who was his precious one . It 's true he ignored me , yelled at me , but still PEONY That 's because he made a mistake with you . And with Ma . Men get carried away sometimes . Then they see the truth . ALICIA You 've gone too far . PEONY Wan na know something ? ALICIA No . PEONY I really want you to hear this . ALICIA I warned you . CELANDINE We do n't want to hear it . PEONY You ready ? ALICIA I 'm going to get you , Peony. p. 78 PEONY I felt like a woman because he loved me . I felt better than you , Ma . ALICIA Your father never cared about you . PEONY Oh , yes , he did . Does ! ALICIA Did he ever want to know your feelings ? Your thoughts ? PEONY I do n't think ! ALICIA So . We 're not going to talk about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ropes ? ALICIA I do n't want to think about it . PEONY He told me secrets . ALICIA Old clichs . And there I was CELANDINE Oh ! I 've got to take a shower ! Wash my hair ! ( She rushes out . ) ALICIA Imagining what might be going on PEONY That 's jealousy . ALICIA ( Lost in her own thoughts . ) I was too cowardly to admit it . PEONY Are you still jealous ? ALICIA Jealous ? Of you ? p. 79 PEONY Okay , I 'm sorry . I should n't have talked about Daddy and me . ALICIA There is no " Daddy and you . " PEONY C'm on , Ma . I know it 's hard for you .
