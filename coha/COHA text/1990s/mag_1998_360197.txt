Almost exactly five years ago , Akio Morita  --  Mr. Sony  --  fell to the ground during a game of tennis . The co-founder and chairman of the board had suffered a stroke . He has since been in a wheelchair . This is particularly sad , as Morita had never been able to sit still and relax . At 72 , he was playing tennis at 7 a.m. each Tuesday . I know this well because I would practice on the court next to him . My tennis , however , was very different from his . I played with an instructor , and if I was tired , I would just take a break . Not him . He challenged everybody , including young athletes . <P> This was in keeping with a man who created one of the first global corporations . He saw long before his contemporaries that a shrinking world could present enormous opportunities for a company that could think beyond its own borders , both physically and psychologically . And he pursued that strategy with his relentless brand of energy in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , according to a Harris survey , Sony is rated the No. 1 brand name by American consumers , ahead of Coca-Cola and General Electric . <P> The best way to describe Morita 's extraordinary drive is to scan his schedule for the two-month period immediately preceding his stroke . He took trips from his home base in Tokyo to New Jersey , Washington , Chicago , San Francisco , Los Angeles , San Antonio , Dallas , Britain , Barcelona and Paris . During that time he met with Queen Elizabeth II , General Electric chief Jack Welch , future French President Jacques Chirac , Isaac Stern and many other politicians , bureaucrats and business associates . He attended two concerts and a movie ; took four trips within Japan ; appeared at eight receptions ; played nine rounds of golf ; was guest of honor at a wedding ceremony ; and went to work as usual for 17 days at Sony headquarters . Morita 's schedule had been decided on more than a year in advance .

Unlike so many executives who remove themselves from the rest of the corporate pyramid , he was always in the middle of the action . <P> Morita had been groomed since the third grade to become the successor of a 14-generation family business : a prominent sake-brewing company in Nagoya . In true entrepreneurial spirit , however , he traded this life of comfort and privilege for the uncertainties of a start-up , called Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering , Inc. , in the rubble of postwar Japan . <P> From the outset , Morita 's marketing concept was brand-name identification and brand responsibility : that the name would instantly communicate high product quality . This is a marketing concept widely used by companies today . But at that time most companies in Japan were producing under somebody else 's brand name . Pentax , for example , was making products for Honeywell , Ricoh for Savin and Sanyo for Sears .
