Danforth Pewterers has come a long way since 1975 , when Fred and Judi Danforth set up housekeeping and a small studio in an old farmhouse in Woodstock , Vermont . The couple put out a sign , and the work sold . " It was like providence , " says Fred . " Our lives changed rapidly from then on . " Chance , change and commitment seem to characterize the lives of the Danforths , who , in 1995 , will celebrate 20 years of marriage o each other and to pewter . It was chance that each found an apprenticeship in a New Brunswick studio , where Fred discovered his fascination with the spinner 's lathe , and Judi realized a dream that began in the metal shops of the Rochester Institute of Technology and the Penland School of Crafts . And it was chance that Fred is descended from a line of 18th-century pewterers  --  " a tradition , " he says , " I had not foreseen reviving . " Now the rampant lion , an adaptation of the touchmark used by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves as the company logo . Change came in 1978 with a move to the mountain town of Lincoln , away from the main roads : the business went from retail to largely wholesale . The couple added a line of case pewter buttons , earrings and ornaments , and in 1988 opened a shop and studio in Middlebury . The business " grew like wildfire . " Today Danforth Pewterers boasts a spacious workshop and retail store , a staff of 40 and a mail-order catalog , and it sells its distinctive holloware at more than 100 retail outlets . The cast line " feeds " the business , but the handcrafted , lead-free holloware remains a major commitment . Using the purest alloy of tin , antimony and copper , Fred spins the work on a century-old lathe , one piece at a time . With a " free spinning " technique developed over the years , he shapes each piece with handmade tools such as the steel " spinner 's finger . " Each item is slightly different  --  because it is handshaped  --  and sanded to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as important as the design ; he likes to see light " dance " on the pewter . Like the work of his forebears , the pieces are classic in design , and wholly functional . At present the holloware line is limited to 20 models , and orders can be filled on demand . Because " it 's important t-o keep quality high , " Fred wants to expand the line slowly . There are Pear vases with gleaming bodies , and courtly candlesticks made with a combination of techniques  --  he " stick " is case in a bronze mold , a time-honored technique that results in a truer casting than a rubber mold can achieve  --  and welded to a spun base . There is a line of children 's cups , bowls , and porringers , including the Classic Pooh Collection baby gift set , which the Danforths make under a licensing agreement with the Walt Disney Company . The Danforth " signature " design , though , according to Fred , is the oil lamp , one of which  --  his elegant Mariner design  --  won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pewter Guild , a trade association . Fred is the only one to spin the entire line , but some of the pieces are spun by three talented helpers , whom he has trained from scratch . " Not everyone can do it , " he says . " You have to nurture toward a keen eye . " The Danforths hire mostly local people , who are " at home in the cold Vermont winters . " The pay for a trainee may begin at $5.75 an hour , while an experienced spinner can take home $12 for that same hour . All Danforth employees join in the profit-sharing and incentive programs , which are based On the end-of-year profits and can boost a salary by several thousand dollars a wear . And each receives full health care coverage for the outlay of five dollars a week . " We wan to be progressive , " Fred says . Neither Fred nor Judi was trained in business , but as they began to delegate authority " we nor only gained back , bur learned in the process . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is open communication among managers and artisans  --  something one notices at once inside the 3,000-square-floor workshop , which gives off an atmosphere of creativity and good cheer . " Fred and Judi are wonderful to work for , " says Judith Versweyveld , the general manager , a former director of the Frog Hollow Craft Center . To address major issues and map our strategies , the management " team "  --  around 11 people  --  meets for two days annually at a Vermont inn . " This time away From the hubbub is invaluable , " Judi maintains . " The long-range view of Danforth Pewterers is important to the whole company . We 've been growing so fast that we have to keep redefining our roles , as well as those of our managers . " But growth stimulates change . And Fred and Judi are always in search of new markets for their holloware . This year they will exhibit at the Rosen Group 's Buyers Markets of American Crafts in Philadelphia , and elsewhere . And Danforth Pewterers makes lamps and bowls as prizes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rut the greatest volume comes through sales to craft galleries and gift and museum shops , principally along the East Coast and in California . Each holloware piece is shipped in a flannel pouch , along with a card about the process , the care of pewter and its colonial history . " People respond to the story behind the work , " Judi notes , " as well as to the aesthetics "  --  a fact that was verified in a recent survey of their customers . As a result , Danforth lamps , bowls and vases have been increasingly sought after by connoisseurs of fine pewter . Yet because pewtersmithing is such a time-consuming craft , " it 's hard to make a profit , " says Fred , who admits that income from Danforth holloware is only " modest . " Moreover , he observes , there is still the problem of educating the public about pewter . He is amazed that " even the encyclopedias call it an alloy of tin and lead ! " Some pewterers can undersell the Danforths by using lead or stamping our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Danforth Pewterers has " a commitment , " declares Versweyveld , outlined in the company statement of mission , " not only to keep the craft alive , but o preserve the quality of life through a lead-free environment . " To this end , the Danforth Pewterers donates a percentage of profits each year to an environmental concern . Of course , there are sacrifices to make for the craft , and for the growth of the business . " There are times when it 's very stressful , " Judi admits , although she is adamant about " guarding time " for the marriage and their two daughters . Bur there is less time for creativity : the one-of-a-kind work and experiments with lighting for Fred , and for Judi , designing holloware in addition to the more lucrative cast line of ornamental items . " There is n't time anymore to come home at noon and feel the grass under m feet , " Fred says . " Yet I sill feel he old values and idealism I had before the company grew . I still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't compromise the craft . " " All of us here are responsible for quality , " Versweyveld says . " People do n't realize how unique these holloware pieces are . In another hundred years they 'll be collector 's items . The way the old Thomas Danforth pewter is now . Absolutely .
