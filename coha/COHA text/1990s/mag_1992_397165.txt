" ... Beautiful children ; couples enjoying a day out ; friendly adults and teenagers of all races and creeds . The racial mix has changed over the years , but the laughter , levity , and camaraderie of those spending a day " at this once major beach attraction are still pervasive . Coney Island 's Boardwalk " sweeps along the ocean for two and a half miles from Brighton Beach all the way to Seagate , and it still supports an endearing mongrel culture all its own , " writes Ric Burns , who directed the documentary " Coney Island " for the Public Broadcasting System 's " American Experience " series . " ... Here you will find pensioners , artists , lovers , idlers , bicyclists , boom box impresarios , photographers , joggers and off-season members of the Polar Bear Club .... The lure of Coney Island was always the lure of the place where opposites met : city and country , land and sea , men and women , children and adults , the natural and the machine-made , almost , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all converging along a bristling strip in a lurid hybrid riot of color , form , light , sound , smells and humanity . " It was the humanity that attracted Myrna Handel Elfenbein to the place once labeled " Sodom by the Sea " because of the violence , decadence , and prostitution found there . Her exhibition of photographs of Coney Island enjoyed a six-week run at Nova Studio in Roslyn , N.Y. , in the winter of 1991 . It 's slated to appear in New York City later in 1992 , though no venue has been set . " I chose Coney Island because I wanted an area where I would encounter people from different backgrounds living in all sections of the city , but all coming to the beach area to relax and get away from their everyday environment . " I really try to capture people in their natural setting before they notice me . I do n't like to set shots up , " she says of her picture-taking method . " The photos that come out best seem to be the ones I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to other people , but I also like to have people relating to their environment . I once took this wonderful shot of children jumping in the waves along the shoreline . Now , obviously , there 's a relationship going on among the kids , but the focus is on the children reacting to the water . " Elfenbein 's initial reaction to Coney Island , after having not seen it for many years , was one of fright . " I was taken aback by how much the place had changed . The reality of dilapidation and neglect of the neighborhood streets , lots , and homes confirmed all that I had heard and read . The concessionaires and locals repeatedly warned me to conceal my camera because it might be stolen . It was frightening . But that fear disappeared once I began shooting . The people were very friendly , very open . I realized there was much more to the place than the run-down buildings or the teenagers on drugs and the many unsavory sorts who were wandering around . There were other people as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; friendly adults and teenagers of all races and creeds . The racial mix has changed over the years , but the laughter , levity , and camaraderie of those spending a day at the beach have remained the same . " When looking to capture a certain person 's mood or a particular place 's atmosphere , Elfenbein usually eschews the use of color film . " Black and white photography creates a different mood . I prefer black and white because it allows me to concentrate on feeling , instead of being concerned about getting the colors right . Also , black and white is n't strictly black and white . The shades of gray in between effectively create different moods . " Elfenbein , whose work has been featured in more than a dozen exhibitions over the last eight years , ca n't help but laugh when admirers ask her detailed questions concerning her photographic equipment . " So many people ask me what camera I use , or what lens , or what F-stop . All that does n't matter . No one would ever ask a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . Everyone seems to think the camera makes the photograph , but it 's the eye that makes a good picture . " My goal , " she adds , " is to photograph those " inexpressible " instances , which is that " something " you really ca n't describe , that fleeting moment of communicating an emotion or concept to another person . If you do n't shoot it , it may pass by without anyone ever noticing it . But if you click the shutter at just the right instant , you 've preserved something special . Oftentimes , a photographer sees ordinary things , but by shooting them at just the right moment and just the right angle , can make them extraordinary . " There certainly is something extraordinary about Coney Island , as well as Elfenbein 's images of the people who still play there . " Coney Island today is one of the great haunted wrecks of our culture , " concludes Burns . " ... There is a kind of majesty to the island 's dereliction .... A lot has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect , at least , the wind-blown stretch of sand at the foot of Brooklyn remains what it has always been : one of the most gloriously seedy and wistful places on Earth , washed by the sea , by the memory of something lost , and by an irresistible optimism about the future .
