<p> At 13 , Lorrie Morgan sealed her destiny by singing from the stage of the Grand Ole Opry . She got more than she bargained for . <p> More than any of her male peers , Morgan has lived and endured the fabled fast-and-bumpy life of country stardom . <p> In some ways , she 's emerged much like her songs , which generally fall into the emotional categories of Hurt and Tough . <p> " I think I 've experienced both of those feelings quite a bit in my life , " says the striking-looking and strikingly direct blonde . " I 'm a person that if I love somebody or if I 'm into something , I want to give it my all . And , more times than I 'd like to remember , I got hurt from it . " <p> True country fans can cite the personal rundown : Her Opry star father , George Morgan ( Candy Kisses , Room Full of Roses ) , died when she was 16 , a year or so after she had begun singing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel guitarist and at 21 was a divorced mother . Then she married country prince Keith Whitley , who died of alcohol poisoning despite her arduous efforts to save him . Then came a third marriage to Clint Black 's bus driver , followed by a divorce and a highly public romance with Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman . <p> These days , the pedigreed country star is seen beaming on the arm of U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson , R-Tenn. , a sometime actor she describes as " a very caring and deep person . " <p> " She 's a very special person in my life , " said Thompson Monday . <p> Morgan indeed appears to be on the upswing in both her personal and professional lives . And art imitates life once again in her new single , I Did n't Know My Own Strength , which leads into her Greatest Hits album , due June 27 . The package draws from a string of four top-selling albums that followed years of frustration and three failed record deals before the singer finally clicked on RCA . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Hal Durham , who was the Opry 's general manager when Morgan sang Paper Roses on the Opry stage and " knocked the audience for a loop . " <p> " A less determined person than Lorrie would never have made it , " Durham says . " She had the grit . " <p> Of her strength , Morgan says she sometimes " did n't know I had it until I had to use it . " <p> And like any good country female singer in a world of hard-headed men , Morgan , 35 , knows you have to bluff and tough your way through . " Sometimes if you look that way on the outside , it starts to filter into the inside . " <p> How Morgan looks on the outside also marks her as country 's sexiest beauty , while her chin-out attitude wins respect from female fans . In her case , women seem to understand the downside of being knock-down gorgeous . In a country universe that portrays women as sweet-tempered and hoping to find or hold onto the right man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Do n't You Understand ) , in which she says flat out that she 's not looking for anybody and shows no mercy to a barroom Lothario . <p> And when she goes a'stalking in her signature Something in Red or sings a weeper like A Picture of Me ( Without You ) in a low-cut dress , it works for about everybody . Both hormones and heartaches rage . <p> In video and concert , Morgan dresses to kill , though the familiar catsuits have been replaced in her current tour by tailored suits and bustiers . The upcoming hits album will feature photos of her in a variety of slips . <p> " I do n't consider myself a sexpot or anything like that . . . but I do n't think there 's anything wrong in dressing and looking like a woman . " <p> Whatever Morgan is doing works . After failed record deals , and more managers than husbands , her last three albums - Leave the Light On , Something in Red and Watch Me - were million sellers , while the latest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit single , an unusual accomplishment in today 's hit-driven country-music industry . <p> Besides the Greatest Hits album , with three new songs that include a reprise of Billy Joe Spears ' vintage country hit Standing Tall , Morgan is this month 's featured artist on Country Music Television and is currently shooting an ABC-TV movie The Enemy Within with Major Dad 's Gerald McRaney . Morgan previously starred in Proudheart , The Nashville Network 's first movie project , and shot a TV pilot in which she played a daytime cop and nighttime singer . <p> She 's speaking in the expansive dining room of her hilltop home , filled with photos of country greats she 's known since she was a child . The dining room contains a gothic-styled dining table , a suit of armor , a couple of her dark and brooding paintings , plus a framed red coat that a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman sent her . <p> Some fans , though , are too zealous , which is why she 's bought a new home for her and daughter Morgan , 14 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My kids get real nervous up here , and to be honest with you , I get a little bit scared , too . There 's nights people try to get in the gates . " <p> In many ways , Morgan is a throwback both musically and personally , and her delivery and style have much in common with such veteran stars as Tammy Wynette , a Morgan heroine . Morgan 's deep-country sensibilities were recognized long before she became a star when she was inducted into the Opry in 1984 . And like many of the plain-spoken legends , she 's often bared her soul to interviewers and fans on everything from her hysterectomy to her love life . <p> " There 's things in my past I 've talked about very freely , because I felt like people wanted to know and deserved to know . " <p> That was particularly true of her marriage to Whitley , a binge drinker who hid alcohol around the house . At one point , Morgan tied her leg to his in their bed to prevent him from drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder on the person who is n't the alcoholic , when you have to sit up and you 've got kids to take care of and they 've got school . Sometimes , you 've just got to get some rest , and that was the only way I could find to get any rest . " <p> Whitley died in 1989 at age 33 while Morgan was touring to promote her debut RCA single , Dear Me . <p> " I do n't feel guilt , because I feel like I loved Keith Whitley more than anybody ever could have , " she says . " But there 's days I think about him , and I miss him . " <p> The bust-up with Aikman , who was eight years younger , was very painful , she says . " Our life was totally in the spotlight . " <p> She and current beau Thompson , she says , are " dating " and have a " very mature relationship . " <p> " It 's difficult . Fred spends a lot of time in Washington and a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on weekends , I 'm on the road . There has to be a lot of strength there to work schedules out and make time for each other . " <p> Thompson has appeared in more than a dozen movies , portraying a presidential chief of staff in In the Line of Fire , head of the CIA in No Way Out and an air-traffic controller in Die Hard 2 . <p> Morgan says the relationship comes at a time when " I finally feel like my life is headed in the right direction . " <p> " I still am a firm believer in fairy tales . I feel that I 'm very fortunate that with all the tragedy and hard things I 've been through , I still believe in romance and I still believe in happily ever after . "
