<p> Judging by the cows grazing quietly beneath the cottonwoods , everything seems peaceful out here on the outermost frontiers of science . But where the farms end and the excavations begin , there is no masking the excitement and the tension . <p> This is a critical spring for the biggest and most expensive piece of scientific laboratory equipment ever contemplated , the $ 8.25 billion Superconducting Super Collider , or SSC . <p> If the project survives technological , political and diplomatic tests in the next few months , the science can move ahead  --  or , rather , move back , toward the first instant after the Big Bang , 15 billion years or so into the universe 's past . <p> Construction is underway , equipment is being delivered and tested , and hundreds of scientists from around the world are already coming here to devise experiments they hope to perform in the next century . <p> All for a project whose completion is by no means inevitable . <p> " At the end of this fiscal year , we will be confident or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which calls for completion in 1999 , said Joseph R. Cipriano , SSC project manager for the Energy Department . Any indication that the SSC is faltering in timetable , technology or expense would strengthen the hand of its foes in Congress , who are preparing for their annual attempt to kill it . <p> Despite its high cost and technical complexity , the SSC is not a mysterious venture . Often described as a " giant atom smasher , " it is essentially a laboratory instrument , which will be capable of observing and recording phenomena that can not be tracked by any existing implement . <p> To high-energy physicists , who are trying to understand the nature of matter and the structure of the universe by analyzing the behavior of infinitesimal particles , the SSC is seen as an essential tool for moving their work from theory to observation . Without it , they are like astronomers without telescopes or archaeologists without digging sites ; they can theorize and postulate , but they can not observe or demonstrate . <p> " Everyone agrees the science is essential , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , director of the Energy Department 's SSC laboratory . " You have to test your ideas against nature . " <p> With existing equipment , such as particle accelerators at Fermilab in Illinois and at Stanford University , " experimentalists are reduced to testing well established theory at higher and higher precision " but can not break through to new ground , according to the journal Science . <p> Most critics of the SSC agree with Schwitters that it would be a useful tool . But they question whether it will work , whether the Energy Department is competent to develop it , whether cost projections are realistic , whether Japan and other countries can be persuaded to pay for part of it and  --  even if the answer to all those question is yes  --  whether the nation can afford it . <p> Sen. Robert C. Byrd ( D-W.Va. ) , chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , recently described the SSC and the proposed $ 30 billion space station as " exotic luxuries that perhaps ought to be put off or canceled until we can shore up our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House voted to kill all funding for the SSC . Opponents , led by Reps . Jim Slattery ( D-Kan. ) and Sherwood L. Boehlert ( R-N.Y. )  --  who says the SSC " will make the infamous $ 600 toilet seat look like a bargain "  --  are expected to try again to delete the $ 650 million budgeted by the Bush administration for fiscal 1993 from the Energy appropriations bill . <p> But budget-conscious politicians are not the project 's only critics . Russell N. Grimes , a chemistry professor at the University of Virginia , wrote last summer that " the SSC ( which stands to benefit primarily a handful of high-energy physicists and the North Texas economy ) is far more threatening to basic research in the sciences than is the space station , since the SSC competes directly for basic science funding . " <p> Grimes was expressing a widespread view that " big science " projects such as the SSC are funded at the expense of " small science " projects done by individual researchers or in less expensive labs . <p> Energy Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to William Happer , the department 's energy research director , President Bush 's proposed 1993 budget provides more than $ 30 billion for scientific research and development , " including nearly $ 8 billion , an increase of more than 9 percent over 1992 , to support individual researchers . " <p> Further fueling the SSC debate is the fact that the project has no known practical benefit and is not designed to have any . The SSC is what is known as " pure science , " to be done for its own sake . It 's as though Columbus had sailed just to prove the world was round , without any prospect of gold and spices . <p> The SSC will consist of a 54-mile circular tunnel buried about 200 feet below ground , surrounding this town 30 miles south of Dallas like a subterranean Beltway . Beams of protons fired in opposite directions at nearly the speed of light will collide with each other at four crossover points  --  about 100 million collisions a second  --  at energy levels far higher than achievable with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collision creates a near-replication of what is believed to have been happening in the first fractions of a second after the " Big Bang " set in motion the forces that created the universe , detectors installed in giant underground chambers along the accelerator tunnel will track the behavior of the particles . <p> It is possible that such observations could confirm the well-established theoretical structure of particle behavior and the forces that govern it , known collectively as the " Standard Model . " More likely , Stanford particle physicist Michael Riordan wrote recently , the SSC would confirm the existence of hypothetical new particles that would " help to resolve bothersome anomalies , quandaries and problems that have turned up in the Standard Model and its various possible extensions . " <p> These include some of the most profound questions imaginable , including : What force in nature gives matter its mass ? What is the unit or particle that conveys that property ? And how is it related to the other fundamental forces and to the groups of particles  --  known as quarks and leptons  --  that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SSC lies in development of more than 10,000 superconducting magnets that will line the tunnel . Electric current flowing through the magnets will create the magnetic field required to control the shape and direction of the beams of protons . Superconductivity  --  a state in which electricity flows without resistance  --  is to be achieved by running the current through a filament of niobium and titanium cooled by liquid helium to 452 degrees below zero . <p> Magnets of this size and capacity have never been mass produced . The first group , or string , of the magnets is scheduled to be hooked together and tested in a corrugated metal shed here in June or July . Tests of individual magnets have been successful , SSC officials said . <p> General Dynamics Corp . and Westinghouse Electric Co. are to manufacture the magnets . <p> Rep. Howard Wolpe ( D-Mich. ) , chairman of the House Science , Space and Technology subcommittee on investigations and oversight , has expressed strong skepticism about whether industry can " mass produce these in a manner that will meet the costs and schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But officials here , working feverishly to install the liquid helium plant and place the first magnets , have no doubt . <p> " We have every confidence , " said Edward Siskin , the construction chief . " There is no basis to think there 's a problem . It 's belt and suspenders . We 'll be running in the tests exactly what we are going to install . " <p> Successful completion of the magnet tests would get the project over a huge hurdle , but it would not end anxiety over funding . The Energy Department has promised Congress that the federal share of the $ 8.25 billion total cost will be no more than $ 5.6 billion . The rest is to come from the state of Texas , which contributed the land , and a still undetermined roster of foreign countries . <p> This promise has proved difficult to keep . The biggest problem has been Japan , which agreed to set up a joint working group to study participation in the project but has shown no rush to come up with any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The non-federal objective can be achieved in fiscal 1993 without Japanese participation , but can not in fiscal 1994 , " Happer told a House appropriations subcommittee last month . <p> A laboratory in Russia is expected to provide magnets for a low-energy , first-state booster system to accelerate the particles , Happer said . South Korea has agreed to supply $ 30 million in the form of scientific personnel . India has promised $ 50 million , and China and Canada are considering participation , he said . <p> According to Boehlert , who was part of a House Science , Space and Technology Committee delegation that visited Japan earlier this year , Japan has " no interest " in the SSC and is feigning interest to please Bush . <p> It is not clear what Congress will do if the foreign funding commitment is not met . According to Siskin , construction will not reach the " point of no return " before 1996 . Until then , it would still cost less to scrap the project than to complete it . <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have next year , " Cipriano said . " The people working on this are very talented . We ought to let them get on with it , or we ought to let them go do something else . "
