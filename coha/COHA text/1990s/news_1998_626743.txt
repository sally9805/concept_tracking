<p> There is sawdust all over the floor inside Howard R. Gmelch Jr . ' s boat-building workshop , a wood-cluttered space next to his Bacliff-area home . <p> This makes him very happy . <p> A former shop teacher , he 's always loved the sight of sawdust on the floor , the way it provides tangible evidence of purposeful work accomplished . More than that , today 's sawdust is further proof that his dream is proceeding on course , moving along like some stately , smooth-sailing vessel . <p> Gmelch ( pronounced gah-melch ) , decked out in a blue bib apron , loudly drills a nail into a triangular-shaped slab of wood as his circle of male cohorts , all fellow passengers in that dream , look on . They hold jars of epoxy , brushes and the expectant expressions of people caught up in a vision . <p> It 's a balmy Saturday morning . Gmelch and companions , as they have done twice weekly since October , work diligently on the Scow Schooner Project , the prime goal of which is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once-common sailing ships that traversed Galveston Bay from around 1850 to 1936 . Shallow , squat and sturdy , they were the workhorses of the Gulf , said Gmelch , used for hauling charcoal , cotton , wood , vegetables and other heavy-load necessities from places such as Anahuac , Double Bayou , Clear Lake and the Trinity River area to Galveston Bay , a hub . <p> Able to navigate the shallow waters of the bay before the creation of the ship channel , the schooners were an indispensable part of 19th-century life . Floating two masts and staffed usually by a man and a boy , said Gmelch , the schooners were common in estuaries along the Gulf Coast , thus the name , as well as in rivers throughout the South and in the San Francisco and Chesapeake bays . " Scow , " these days a somewhat derogatory word , denotes boats that do n't come to a point . The one Gmelch is replicating , probably built on the Trinity River , was smaller and speedier than most scows . <p> The replication is painstaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven men - all engineers and computer types - are working on the bow transom , an end piece . The building jig of the boat - a sort of removable skeleton the boat itself will be " wrapped " around - is already complete and rests collapsed against a wall until needed . The crew is currently at work translating mathematical calculations deduced from an archival set of blueprints into three-dimensional , pine-wood reality . Soon , it will be time to assemble all the various parts around the jig , and - voila ! - a boat is born . <p> The " splash date " for the vessel ( the name remains a secret ) is July 1999 . Sure to be impressive , the schooner is nonetheless only the centerpiece of a much larger vision . Gmelch , an ardent nature lover , has far bigger plans indeed . He and members of his nonprofit Galveston and Trinity Bay Maritime Conservation Education Society hope to create a host of programs radiating from the boat - a maritime museum and nature center , a boat-building school , educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more . <p> The goal is to raise awareness of the need to preserve and protect the fragile Bay area , but Gmelch said he 'll avoid any heavy-handed , **25;684;TOOLONG approach . <p> " We 're not going to do any soapbox preaching , " said Gmelch , 51 , a wiry , intense man with clear blue eyes and the driven air of someone on a mission . " We 're just going to present the history of the Bay , show how it 's changed through its different uses . Those who come will get the message . " <p> At the heart of the project lies Gmelch 's firm belief that children , if they 're to grow into adults who respect the environment , must experience nature first hand . Classroom instruction on ecology is fine , he said , but it only goes so far . What he envisions is an after-school program where kids build their own kayaks or small boats , then paddle out into the salt spray , with an adult guide . <p> That 's how Gmelch gained his love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exploring Great South Bay under the tutelage of a boat-loving grandfather . He waxed poetic about the time he nosed his canoe into a marsh , looked down in the rippling water and spied fiddler crabs gamboling just beneath the surface . <p> These days , he said , many children lack this sort of wise grandfather-guide , as well as a safe way to revel in nature . That 's what he wants to re-create for them : The smell of sea air . The rise and fall of tides . The dance of crabs . <p> " Studies show that if you expose children ages 8 to 11 to the natural world , they will develop a sense of stewardship , " said Gmelch . " They will take what they see into their hearts and make it a part of them . " <p> So , 1 1/2 years ago , Gmelch - who 'd learned woodworking and boat-building as a boy from a second grandfather - put his boat restoration company and boat-building school on hold to give his attention full-time to the project . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fellow history , ecology or boat-building buffs . Among the crew ( heavy on caps and beards ) is a NASA subcontractor who does computer research on " space consumables , " a planning director for a pipeline company , a librarian , a corrosion engineer and a member of the negotiating team for the international space station . One man drives twice a week from Freeport , an hour away , to help build the boat . <p> " I 'm doing it for my grandkids , " said Bob Lindveit , a retired mechanical engineer in cap and mustard-yellow jumpsuit . He stands under a ceiling lined with gleaming , Gmelch-built kayaks . <p> They 're drawn , they said , by fellowship and the challenge of eking something magnificent out of raw wood . <p> " What I do on a daily basis , I do n't get to work with my hands , " said Duard Franklin , an electrical engineer who serves as chief of the building crew . " I do n't get to create something , to stand back and look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also all signed onto Gmelch 's dream of the larger project , which he laid out to them one stormy night in February 1997 at a rented room inside the Seabrook Shipyard Clubhouse . <p> The seeds for the dream took root decades ago , when Gmelch was a young man and just out of the military . It was the Vietnam War era , and he 'd grown disillusioned with American society , he said . Dispirited , he retreated with a woman companion into the wilds of the Cibola National Forest in New Mexico , where they lived for a decade in a house he built with his own hands , complete with a water and sewer system he created . For entertainment , they played musical instruments he crafted out of wood . <p> Eventually , Gmelch rejoined society and became a shop teacher in New Mexico , developing his own program to teach woodworking to special education students . After awhile , the school administration wanted him to teach shop only part-time , and to serve as a part-time coach , as well . Gmelch ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development studies department . All the while , he said , he felt something inside of him dying . Something connected to those fiddler crabs back on Great South Bay . <p> What if , he said to his wife , Jonnie Gmelch ( not the woman who retreated with him to the forest ) . . . what if he tried to replicate for children the experiences he had growing up ? Something that would also express his own deep beliefs in conservation ? <p> They would need to live near the water , he said , someplace where his idea had n't already been established . He began doing research on bays in need of help . He learned of Galveston Bay , the seventh-largest estuary in the United States and the only one lacking its own maritime museum exclusively devoted to bay ecology . Estuaries , explained Gmelch , are areas where freshwater and saltwater meet . They are nurseries , or " wombs of the ocean , " as he calls them , where 70 percent of all sea life gets its start . They represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet Galveston Bay , he said , has been hard used by civilization , polluted , developed and overharvested with little regard for the life growing there . <p> " The bay needed me , " he said . <p> That Jonnie had been born on Galveston Island and had family going back at least five generations cinched the deal . They moved to Bacliff in 1989 . His soft-spoken , smiling wife of 10 years said she has n't doubted her spouse 's vision for a moment . <p> " Nope , I know he can do this , " said Jonnie , now a special education teacher of seventh- and eighth-graders in the Dickinson school district . <p> Gmelch spent years building his business and " treading water " - gathering information he would need to pursue his dream . He saw other bay conservation projects begin and fail . When he launched the Scow Schooner Project ( by default in his own shop ) , the first project of the society , which boasts about 50 members , he had no money and no credentials as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has run up against certain **28;711;TOOLONG attitudes and " a sort of Catch-22 that says if you do n't have the money , we wo n't give you the money . " <p> Last November , however , he won a federal matching grant that will pay for half the schooner 's construction . He gets the check in July . ( So far , members of his crew have purchased the required yellow and white pine out of their own pockets . ) Gmelch recently returned from a weeklong tour of boat-building projects in the Chesapeake Bay area , and said his guys are way out front . <p> " They 're peerless , " he said proudly . <p> Like most visionaries , Gmelch is a perfectionist , not keen on compromising his ideals for expediency or gain . But the crew has made a few nods to modernity for the boat 's sake . They 've used epoxy - a petroleum derivative that did n't exist in the 19th century - and a few other modern techniques on the schooner 's exterior to make it easier to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down inside the boat , it will look exactly like it did back then , " said Gmelch , who pictures the boat as a " floating classroom , " anchored close to the museum for visitors to paddle out to and board . <p> These days , he spends much of his time not in his shop but on the telephone , computer and fax machine , wrapped up in grant writing , fund raising and promotions for his project , working 16- to 20-hour days . He gets help from daughter Shauna Berardinelli , Jonnie 's child from a previous marriage and an attorney in Bacliff . What the Scow Schooner Project needs now , he said , is a good computer . Even better : a person willing to donate his or her house on the coast to the project . That 's how all the major maritime museums got started . <p> " And with someone like me , " he said . <p> The crew will display its 37-foot hull-in-progress at Bay Day , an annual bay ecology festival sponsored by the Galveston Bay Foundation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Scow Schooner Project , he said , will only complement the efforts of other conservation groups working in the area . <p> He will succeed - he 's sure of it . People told him he could n't survive alone in the back woods of New Mexico . He did . They told him he could n't teach fine wood craftsmanship to mentally retarded students . He did . Some have scoffed at the idea that a humble boat-builder can help save Galveston Bay . <p> " But it 's not just the boat . It 's conservation , it 's boat-building , it 's a museum , " he said passionately . " It all fits .
