" It 's sounds a lot like your cafe . I mean i love your cafe , but I would n't want to spend an eternal Sunday in it.But I kinda like that idea , that we 'll all be together when we die.My daughter moved away to Seattle . But my lover and I have some piece and quiet now . And believe me , when you get older , the sex , it does get better and better . But funny , that 's not the important thing anymore .

Never thought I 'd act like my mother either , I started acting like her right away . My grandmother did everything she wanted to do in life . See , she was sick in the hospital with cancer . Doctors said she was gon na die . And she 's lying there and she looks straight at my mother and says , " I 've faced death , and I 'm not afraid to die . " And then , boom , she checks out of the hospital , goes home , and gets well.And after that she did everything she wanted to do . She went to see all her friends , she visited the Mayan pyramids , she even took this senior citizen cruise to Alaska.See my grandmother had this idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LA . Do you remember back in 70s , when we had to conserve water , everybody had those cacti and alovera for front lawns , and we could n't flush the toilet ? Grandma used to say , " I do n't see why the government does n't just go up to Alaska and get one of thosewhat you call themicebergs and pull it down here on a tug boat , put it in a lake . Then there would be plenty of water for everyone . I do n't see why not . " I said you could n't do that because by time you pulled an iceberg all the way down from Alaska , it would be the size of an ice cube.She 'd say , " I think it 's a good idea . " Now , why did I bring that up . Oh , yeah . Beacause I 'm dying . I mean , not right this second , but someday.And I before I go , I want to visit this land of the icebergs , to see these ice giants for myself , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights , like the reflection from an iceberg shine on her from offstage right .
