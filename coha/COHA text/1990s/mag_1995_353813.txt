" It 's a round world , " says a calm , philosophical Alfonse D'Amato , " and every thing comes back . So treat people the way you want to be treated . " The New York Senator is performing for a journalist in his Washington office . He 's playing the New D'Amato  --  the same gracious character who has been seen on TV running the Senate Whitewater hearings and promoting a new autobiography . This is the persona designed to dim the memory of the Old Al , a cunning machine politician who was rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee in 1991 after a dozen influence-peddling scandals had thoroughly soiled his name . " Be generous and fair , " the New D'Amato says in conclusion , " not malevolent and meanspirited . " <P> Then the phone rings , and the Old Al is back . " Philly ! " he barks at Philip Smith , his finance director at the National Republican Senatorial Committee , where D'Amato is in charge of recruiting , promoting and bankrolling Senate candidates nationwide . Smith is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " D'Amato roars . " Get with the program ! No ! Get your brain in synch . " He tries to restrain himself , but it 's hard . He cracks the whip about fund raising  --  " I 'm not happy ! Speed it up ! "  --  then checks on an event . " How much we gon na gross ? Hell , you got ta do better ! Fifty percent of that ? All right . It 's better than a stick in the eye . " He hangs up , looking fully alive . He ca n't keep the Old Al down . <P> Ask a Senator from either side of the aisle to name the reigning king of Washington 's money game  --  the lawmaker who symbolizes what most people ca n't stand about the process  --  and Al D'Amato will get the nod . His new prominence derives from his simultaneous hold on three top positions : chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , head of Bob Dole 's presidential steering committee and chief of the G.O.P. organization that raises money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unrivaled  --  and , many critics say , unsavory  --  and make him one of the most powerful politicians in Washington . This week three of his Senate colleagues plan to challenge D'Amato 's power , but the odds are against them . He is a bare-knuckle player even by the raucous standards of Capitol Hill , a club fighter who lives for the ring . He curses and cajoles , bestowing favors and exacting revenge , cutting his endless , beloved deals : a compromise to push through a bill , an infusion of cash for an ally 's campaign , a raise for someone else 's staff member  --  anything to prove his power and display his reach .
