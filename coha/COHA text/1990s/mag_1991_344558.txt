At this time four years ago , the Democratic presidential contenders were roundly derided as " the seven dwarfs . " Ten months later , Michael Dukakis began the general election campaign with a double-digit lead and George Bush seemed doomed . " It is always volatile , " says Roger Ailes , the media magician who helped guide Bush 's comeback in 1988 , " and it is sure to be volatile again . If 75 years of communism can collapse in three days , anything is possible , anywhere . " <P> Ailes ' caution is not surprising . Overconfidence is congenitally avoided so far in advance of an election . But G.O.P. strategists privately point to eight potential pitfalls capable of crippling the President next year , either singly or in combination : <P> 1 . Iran-contra disclosures suggesting that Bush knew more than he has admitted . <P> 2 . Proof that the late CIA director William Casey conspired to have U.S. hostages held by Iran until after the 1980 election . <P> 3 . A Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions that cause large numbers of female Republicans to defect to the Democrats . <P> 4 . A foreign policy tangle that negates the high marks Bush has won for his handling of the gulf war and the Soviet Union 's failed coup . ( Upheaval in China is No. 1 on the watch list . ) <P> 5 . Renewed concerns about the President 's health that accentuate qualms about Dan Quayle . <P> 6 . A combative Democratic candidate who wages an " in your face " campaign that ties Bush closely to his patrician roots . After New York 's Mario Cuomo , who still appears disinclined to run , Bush 's advisers most fear Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa . Their public glee at the prospect of an old-fashioned liberal leading the Democrats is tempered by Harkin 's populist rhetoric and slashing stump style . <P> 7 . A halting , flustered debate performance that diminishes Bush 's strongest suit , his image of competence . <P> 8 . A sagging economy . This trumps every other fear . Administration officials admit they do n't have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall of ' 92 and that it wo n't matter what the economic indicators really prove . " If the polls continue to show that almost 60% of the electorate thinks the country is on the wrong track , " says a G.O.P. aide , " we could be on the track out of here . " <P> To some degree , these scenarios prove that political aides are paid to worry ; most Bush advisers are confident about the outcome of next year 's election . " Even with bumps in the road , " says Rich Bond , the Republican consultant who engineered Bush 's startling upset of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 Iowa caucuses , " at some point the President will stare straight into the camera and remind people that the world is still a very messy place and that he , rather than the other guy , has proved he can manage America 's role in it . When all is said and done , that should be enough . "                @ @ @ @ @
