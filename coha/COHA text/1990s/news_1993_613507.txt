<p> Stuttgart , Germany - After they scraped him off the track at the Olympic Trials last summer and stuck his injured leg into a cast it did n't need , sprinter Andre Cason was afraid to wear track shoes again . His father , William , offered encouragement by telling him to screw those spikes in his shoes right now . Go mow the yard . Walk around the house in them until he felt comfortable . <p> Then , once back on the track , he would flinch during practice runs after 35 meters , the stage at which he collapsed in the race with a torn calf muscle . <p> " I heard doctors saying , ' He wo n't be the same again , ' " said Cason . " I thought , ' I 'm going to show you , you and you that I 'll be back . ' I always said that : I 'm going to be back . " <p> He is not only back , but Cason is rolling again . The sprinter who moved to Atlanta in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite to win the World Championships 100-meter title this weekend , even with sprint kings Carl Lewis ( 1984 and ' 88 Olympic gold medalist and world record holder ) and Linford Christie of Great Britain ( 1992 gold medalist ) in the field . Preliminaries begin Saturday , with the finals on Sunday . <p> Cason , 24 , won the recent USA/Mobil Track and Field Championships with wind-aided times of 9.79 and 9.85 seconds . Only Lewis has run faster , a wind-aided 9.78 in 1988 . The official world record is 9.86 by Lewis . <p> " I 'm just picking up where I left off last year , " said Cason , who joins longtime Decatur resident Gwen Torrence in making metro Atlanta a sprinter 's hotbed . " I feel like I 'm the golden child . " <p> Thirteen months ago , he felt jinxed . He was about one-third through with his first-round race at the trials in New Orleans when he felt excruciating pain and crumpled to the track .

' said his wife , Charisse , then his fiancee . " I said , ' Things happen for a reason and you 'll have your chance next year . ' I knew he could do it . " <p> Cason had his doubts . " I did n't want to accept what happened because I knew I should have won the Olympic gold medal , " he said . " But now I can let that go and chalk it up to experience . " <p> However , he did n't let the nightmarish race go until two weeks before the ' 93 nationals . At that stage , he said , " I had a beam just shining over me . " <p> Despite aspects of the finals that he described as technically poor - " I was running like a duck from five meters to 20 meters " - the series of 100s was Cason 's finest ever . In fact , it was the finest ever by anyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the trials , he was diagnosed with a torn left Achilles tendon and his leg was placed in a cast . Later , he went to the Hughston Clinic in Columbus , Ga . The doctors who had taken care of Dominique Wilkins told him his Achilles was fine , but he had torn the soleus muscle in his lower calf . The cast had been unnecessary and had caused atrophy , leaving his leg in a weakened condition . <p> During his recovery , he was encouraged and inspired by his family , including his grandmother who had recovered from a heart attack and a stroke . He also got a lift from a couple of athletic pals , welterweight champion Pernell Whitaker and Buffalo Bills linebacker Bruce Smith . <p> " It was a learning experience , " said Charisse . " It 's like when you have money , everybody 's around , and when it 's gone , everybody 's gone . He found out about different people , about who will stick with you .

The rest had caught up . <p> Now 5-foot-7 , Cason said , " I 'll tell any little kid that if somebody tells you you ca n't do something , they 're lying . People say ' He 's too short . He does n't have the distance per stride as Carl Lewis who is 6-2 has . ' I can say anything is possible . " <p> Cason burst onto the international scene with a world junior championship in 1988 . He won in the World University Games in 1989 while at Texas A &M,; where he turned down coach Jackie Sherrill 's personal request to play football . He won the World Indoor Championship at 60 meters in 1991 , was second in the Pan American Games and ran a race in 9.88 seconds that was declared wind-aided even though there was no gauge . He did set a world mark at 60 meters and ran on the world-record 400- meter relay at the 1991 World Championships . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He left the West Coast because he felt John Smith , who also coaches Kevin Young and Quincy Watts , was n't giving him enough attention due to his injury . <p> In 1990 , Cason predicted to Seagrave , who at the time was coaching Ben Johnson , " You know someday you 're going to be my coach . " <p> The time was right late last year . " He told me I had my best races ahead of me , " said Cason . " I told him , ' You be my coach . ' " <p> One of Seagrave 's first challenges was to help Cason overcome his disaster at the trials . <p> " There are people I have worked with that have never been able to let it all hang out again , " said Seagrave . " It took him a while psychologically to get past the 35-meter barrier in training sessions . " <p> Seagrave 's highly technical approach did n't mesh with Johnson , whom he left after a short period , but it fits Cason 's temperament .

A team of trainers and doctors takes care of Cason 's aches and pains , studies periodic blood samples and oversees nutrition . <p> " He has improved on his start , which many people thought was not possible , " said Seagrave , " and there are big changes in terms of acceleration , top speed and speed maintenance . " <p> And reputation . <p> " My life has changed but I have n't , " said the deeply spiritual Cason , who lives in a Buckhead condo with Charisse . Their first child is due in September , while Cason 's 2-year-old son , Cameron , lives with his mother in Alabama . <p> " I know that when I 'm healthy and I 'm at my best , there 's no one in the world that can beat me . " <p> Cason is critical of Lewis for attempting to play mind games before a race . <p> " I 've caught him staring at me . I look back and do a double-take . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said .
