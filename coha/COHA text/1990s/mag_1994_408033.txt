Friday morning in a Toronto preschool . Fourteen children , two teachers , a volunteer ; no surprises yet . Nor do the children seem different in the way they interact . In one corner a boy and girl are digging in the sand together . Only upon closer glance do you notice that the girl is wearing a thick brace . ( " Spina bifida , " a teacher later tells me  --  a deforming birth defect in which much of the spine and nerves remain outside the body . ) A little boy gets up slowly and staggers awkwardly across the room , his hands waving uncontrollably in a greeting . " Hi Zachary , " responds another boy his age , this one lacking any apparent disability . A grinning , giggling little boy reaches across a table stacked with plastic animals , picks up a purse , carries it over to the teacher and hands it to her . It is only when he turns around that one recognizes that this child has Down Syndrome  --  the mysterious chromosome which can devastate so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to others . It 's just a regular morning at Play and Learn , a fully integrated preschool founded in 1975 by Karen Oster . Oster insists on two waiting lists  --  one for children without disabilities and a second for those with special needs  --  and she maintains close to a 50/50 ratio in each class . So why do parents of kids who are not disabled go out of their way to provide their children with this deliberately 50/50 , integrated learning environment ? Children tend to adapt to those they play with , " says Ilana Nirenberg , who eagerly brought her first child ( " with no special needs " ) to the program . " Some people can be uncomfortable with the disabilities of others , but here they learn that it 's part of everyday life . It teaches both the children  --  and their parents  --  respect for differences . " Dad David Himelfarb echoes Nirenberg 's words , adding proudly , " My son has never articulated any sense that his many disabled buddies have anything " wrong " with them  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl with severe mental and physical handicaps . " The humanity of children , so commonplace at Play and Learn , is remarkable . If you are the parent of a child who is not disabled , try this little test , which inclusion expert Marsha Forest regularly gives to " educators who are also parents " : Imagine for a moment that you have a child who today is happy , healthy , attending his or her local school , and progressing normally . Reflect for a moment on where you would want the child to go to school , should he or she be in a car accident and become unable to walk without assistance and unable to learn quickly ... Forest always receives the same answer : parents would want the child to stay with the family , as well as be with friends at the regular school in the regular classroom , with all the necessary supports . Approximately one in ten Canadian children has special needs  --  that includes physical , mental , learning or behavioural disabilities . Should we care whether they attend the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past few years , so - called mainstreaming or integration has become the goal , if not the norm , for nearly every school board of this country ( see " The Big Picture  --  A Provincial Overview " on page E27 ) , so it makes sense to know more about it  --  How does it work ? Can it fail ? Is it worthwhile ? ( Worthwhile ? Some advocates say it is nothing less than a profound philosophical debate , with a new set of questions : What kind of school communities do we want ? What values will we model for our children ? And even , What do we want the future to look like ? ) It 's pretty clear that not making sure children with special needs have access to their neighbourhood schools is costing us plenty  --  certainly financially , if not morally and ethically ( see " Sobering Statistics on Special Needs " on page E28 ) . And the pendulum is swinging toward full integration . Fair enough . But , like all good things in life , is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be troublesome . States Juli Voyer , executive director of the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada in Ottawa : " The problem is , classes can become a dumping ground where special needs children wo n't have their special needs cared for . So , if they 're all placed in regular classrooms without special programming , they can easily be left behind . " " Will their needs be met ? " echoes Ann LeFresne , former administrative assistant at the Ontario Federation for Cerebral Palsy . " With all the cutbacks going on , we are concerned . After all , integration does not mean just placing a child in a class . " Ah , there 's the rub , as an emotionally disturbed Prince of Denmark once complained . These are hard times . There is hardly a school board jurisdiction in Canada today that is not experiencing cutbacks in funding for education . But need the inclusion of special needs children into regular classrooms be more expensive ? And does it work , for both the child with the disability and the " healthy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with parents and teachers across Canada , appear to be " not necessarily " to the first question and " undoubtedly " to the second . Although it seems self - evident that caring for children with special needs must cost more ( All those computers ! That aide for the kid in the wheelchair ! Those additional teachers ! ) , every advocate challenges this concern . Marsha Forest , co - founder and director of the Toronto - based Centre for Integrated Education and Community , insists that this is just not so . " It 's not more money that 's needed , but rather distributing and reorganizing existing money . " Figure not transcribed Karen Oster of Play and Learn insists , " We do n't need more money . It 's the opposite , really . We need more , better - trained aides , and fewer consultants at the top . " Oster goes on to argue that " we must create classes where people team - teach , rather than have the special - ed teacher down the hall . It 's just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not left with one teacher and 25 students , several of them with disabilities . Then comes the risk of backlash  --  and a return to segregated classes again . I fear this terribly . " Indeed , Oster sees a dangerous pattern emerging from integration that is achieved without good , solid planning . " I hear principals say , " Not in my school ! We do n't have the staff or resources ! ' And while some teachers have the goodwill , many lack experience in dealing with these children , and feel totally inadequate . Because they do n't know what to do with the special needs kids , those children are victimized and left out ... One of our jobs has to be to teach teachers , in their communities , about how to modify their lessons and support these children . " Winnifred MacInnis , a special - ed consultant in Charlottetown , is in agreement with both Forest and Oster : " Kids should be with other children when they are in school , regardless of their disabilities ; that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more on special ed , but if we can get our act together , and with an accepting attitude  --  with a whole school taking on these children  --  we can do it with costs that are similar to those in the past . " She , too , has her fears about the future . " When there are financial cutbacks , you always hear the murmurs , " Who will get the resources ? Who deserves the resources ? ' Unfortunately , we 'll hear more and more of that . So we must make sure that we do n't sacrifice anyone 's individual needs for the sake of integration , as we prepare all our children to be what they can be . " Interestingly , Forest observes that " the most important thing is to involve the other children - - even same - age kids  --  and you build within the classroom . You do n't need a lot of adults . The hidden resource inside every school , and its most under - utilized , is other children . She offers training to teachers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrate their classmates with special needs , and she sees all this as one of the goals of education . " It 's problem - solving  --  if a kid ca n't talk , the teacher and the class can discuss " How do we deal with this ? " There 's a real , live exercise on how to survive in this crazy world . " A good example of what Forest is talking about can be found in Pointe Claire , Quebec , where teacher Brenda Henry is currently integrating a 15 - year - old girl ( let 's call her Tracey ) with William 's Syndrome  --  a condition that strikes only one in 30,000 , giving each child a similar , elfin face . " Tracey operates at a grade - two level , repeating phrases a lot like Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man . " In the same class is another student , who is ten - percent sighted , and one with severe learning disabilities " who has difficulty reading a whole sentence . " What to do ? No problem , says Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class , making sure all are served . " Sometimes parents say to me , " My child is smart , will he be ignored ? ' Well , it does n't happen , the way we do it ... We get a lot of back - up from other teachers and parents  --  and we use grade elevens as tutorial assistants , so no one ever gets left out . " When Tracey first arrived Henry arranged that she go with the teacher 's aide to the library to get a book . She then said to the class : " We have Tracey in our class and I need your help . Who would like to be her tag - team tutor ? " In other words , the teacher gets every student on board  --  " a different child every day will sit with special needs students "  --  and it ends up becoming " leadership training . " Henry had a child design a certificate , and at the end of each term , it is awarded to all the tag - team tutors . Educators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for integration . The parents of children with disabilities appear to be almost universally in favour of placing their sons and daughters into the same classrooms that kids without disabilities attend ( although there are some interesting exceptions , as noted below ) . This has n't always come without a fight  --  even a court case . Ian Rowett , now living in Cambridge , Ontario , is a social worker who helps run the 400 - member provincial organization , Integration Action Group . He had to fight through the courts for the right to have his daughter Jaclyn , born 16 years ago with Down Syndrome , attend regular classes in the neighbourhood public school . It became a major Charter of Rights case . " Children used to go to one - room schoolhouses  --  to local schools . Now we have labelling , and special - ed classes , " says Rowett . " But all we wanted was that our daughter and son go to the same school together . We did n't see why , due to these labels , there had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Jaclyn did n't feel that she needed to be with other so - called handicapped children . " When asked if the other children in the regular school his daughter now attends are upset by her presence , Rowett replies , " In my experience , most children are very accepting of any difference . It 's not kids who need to be convinced of this ; it 's some adults who have the fears ! They fear it will take away from their children 's education . But that 's not so . When you have children with special needs who are integrated , it can change the atmosphere of the entire school . It moves the children away from intolerance ; after all , most intolerance is the fear of the unknown . It gets kids looking at the person , first ; not at the label . It 's not a cerebral palsy kid , or a Down 's kid ; it 's an individual . " Rashmi Nathwani , a consultant and single parent in Toronto , went through similarly painful experiences with his now - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autistic . Like so many other parents , Nathwani found that " under the guise of helping us out , " his child was put into segregated classes with " strictly developmentally and physically handicapped kids . " Now , says Nathwani , " after a long battle through elementary and secondary schools , I 'm finally pleased with his placement at Danforth Tech , where he 's integrated into half his classes . " The results have been overwhelmingly positive . " My son 's socialization skills are much better , in just one year . And he shows signs of real independence ; he now takes the subway by himself . I 'd say that 80 percent of the kids treat him very well . " How about the ones who do n't ? " A couple of kids hassled Ravi in the library , where he stacks books , and made fun of him . A teacher then sat the kids down and explained autism to them , and talked about his involuntary actions and tics . There was real shame on their faces , and they now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Success stories among younger children are equally easy to find . Vancouver lawyer Rose Raven , a board member of the Canadian Down Syndrome Society , has four children . The oldest , nine - year - old Natalie , has Down Syndrome . She has been in regular classes in her neighbourhood school since kindergarten . " From the time Natalie was born , " says her mother , " I wanted her to be accepted by the community in the same way as she was accepted by our family . And the only way that could occur was if she were in the community , going to the same school , the same recreation centres . " Raven has been pleasantly surprised by Natalie 's acceptance by her peers , and teachers . " She 's invited to all the birthday parties and sleepovers ; she sells cookies door - to - door , and goes on camp trips . " At school , Natalie is given her own individual education plan to work with , and there is a half - time special - ed assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's parents " to discuss her strengths and weaknesses . We put together goals in academics , social , and behavioural areas . " Raven admits that " I seem to have an unusually satisfying story ; so many other parents have to bang their heads against brick walls to get their kids integrated . " Are teachers fighting battles , too ? If so , the words of several teachers suggest that there is no better , more worthwhile war to be won in education today . Angela MacDonald , a specialed consultant with Regional School Unit #1 in western P.E.I. , recalls how her nine - year - old son recently referred to a friend with cerebral palsy who is in his class . " All my son declared was , " He does n't write good . " My son does n't look at the differences , like we did as kids . My son is not brilliant , but he realizes , through this contact , that he does n't have to be good at everything . This knowledge allowshim to make mistakes , and not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I placed a multi - handicapped boy in one local school , and the teachers keep telling me , " It 's been great having him here . ' ' " That child , it should be noted , is tube - fed , visually - impaired , wheelchair - bound , and has no language . " The school wanted him , " MacDonald points out , adding that in a six - hour day , the boy is with his " healthy " peers for up to five hours , and taken out only for physiotherapy . Yet there is no sense of altruistic do - goodism here : " We do n't see it as integration or inclusion . We just see it as meeting everyone 's needs as best as we can . " Patricia Hatt , a program leader for special needs adults in continuing education with the North York ( Ontario ) Board of Education  --  who has severe learning disabilities herself  --  sees " inclusion " as meaning how we treat those students as well . " When a student is identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; others must not decide how he must learn . The student has to say to the teacher , " I ca n't do the assignment that way ; can the 20 pages be on tape ? Can it be in point - form ? ' You have to look at how you perform well , given your limitations . " Hatt feels strongly that , with proper support , inclusion is positive for every kind of child . " A child in a rarified atmosphere wo n't be a moral person . A rich environment teaches you that the most beautiful and the brightest are n't necessarily the best . " Referring to the new employment equity laws in her province , she adds , " What if we have never been exposed to those who are different ? How does one work with a fellow worker in a wheelchair  --  a person who was once seen only as an obstacle and as an object of pity ? Today 's children will someday be in the workplace , and will supervise  --  and be supervised by  --  people with disabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reflect the real world . " In my day , if children in school were different , they were teased and mocked , because no one ever explained to us why they were different , " she says . " My attitude is , tell the class the truth ... Kids really are kinder than we think , when we let them in on it . " She recalls how , once , a visually - impaired student in her class bumped into an older boy in the hallway , who then shoved the student really hard . Another teacher simply sat down with the boy and explained , " That student has only ten percent ofthe sight that you have , and bumps into people and things because the student sees only shadowy shapes . " The boy was mortified : " Oh , I did n't know that ! I 'm really sorry ! " As Henry observes , " You let the kids " in , " and attitudes change . " As for teachers who are reluctant to deal with special needs children : " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So I just tell them , " No one ever trained us for our mid - life crises or for divorce , but we came through them ! ' ' " Are there legitimate arguments against total integration of kids with special needs ? Of course , and they come from groups and places you might not immediately expect . Sonjia Common , an instructor at the Canadian National Institute for the Blind , says that the CNIB has no " blanket statement " or position on the question . " It 's an individual choice . Many blind students and their parents feel that it 's better to be in a specialized school . It depends upon each family 's situation . " Joe McLaughlin , principal of the Alberta School for the Deaf , who proudly describes himself " as the first deaf principal in Canada in this century , " is adamantly opposed to wholesale integration of his community . Speaking through an interpreter , he explains , " Deaf children are different . Those with physical disabilities can do well , because they can communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaf children in mainstream classes end up being segregated more than those in an all - deaf class . " Thus , for the deaf , " integration is not a goal . In a regular classroom , there is no deaf role model , and no deaf culture . Think of the harm of all - white schools on native children . I feel that specialized schools for the deaf are very important . " In Saskatchewan , an earlier government phased out special schools for the deaf in 1989/90 , and " there are groups in our province who would like to see such schools brought back , " admits Pat Atkinson , Minister of Education , Training and Employment , who is a former teacher of special needs students . In other words , people with disabilities  --  and their parents  --  should have the right to access all services , and have the right to decide that certain placements are not for them . Wally Cooke , the assistant superintendent for the Board of Education in Antigonish , Nova Scotia , argues that " regrettably , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every child . We do n't see the classroom as the place where the handicapped child has to fit . The concept of what a classroom is has to change to make integration work . " Cooke suggests that " all children in our system are mainstreamed to whatever extent possible , " but he quickly notes that " some parent groups are aggressively opposed to the closing of Children and Youth Training Centres for the Handicapped , " which still exist in Nova Scotia . These facilities are not publicly funded schools , but private residential institutions . As for the advocates who fight endlessly for the inclusion of all children in regular classrooms , Cooke responds , " Segregation is n't all wrong , and integration is n't all right . People should have options , choices and opportunities . We have no right to say to the parents of handicapped children , " No , your child must be in this class , with these other kids . ' Many children have needs which can not possibly be met under the same set of circumstances as every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , adds Cook , " I am not aware of any data that shows that by increasing the time during which " handicapped " and " non - handicapped " are educated together , there is a corresponding increase in tolerance . Enhancing tolerance is not the strongest argument for inclusive education . " It 's probably impossible to scientifically measure tolerance , but the anecdotal evidence alone is compelling . Just listen to Karen Oster of Play and Learn : " Normal kids learn so much from being with disabled ones ; they learn that there are many different flavours of children - a learning principle that will take them far in life . They learn acceptance , which goes far beyond tolerance . They learn how to communicate with kids who have different skills than they . We see preschoolers who pick up sign language from others ! By just being next to each other , they learn how to gear their level of communication to children with fewer skills than they . " Then , Oster hits you right in the heart : " We see altruistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only three - or four - years - old , going over  --  without being asked  --  to help another child with her braces , or handing a boy an artificial limb after a gym program . You ca n't teach this . It 's part of the experiential learning environment . You see , ifkids grow up together , they learn principles of nurturing and being fair and kind to one another . It 's our role , as parents and educators , to see that this happens . " So , ultimately , it 's not just about having that boy in the wheelchair or that girl with Down Syndrome sitting next to your son or daughter . " That 's only a tiny piece of the puzzle , " exclaims Marsha Forest . " Rather , inclusion is about how we deal with diversity , how we deal with difference , how we deal  --  or avoid dealing  --  with our mortality . The inclusion issue cuts directly to the core of our values and beliefs .

The Big Picture - a Provincial Overview If provincial reports , declarations and brochures from across the country are to be believed , it appears as if everyone is on the mainstream/integration bandwagon . Here 's a sampling . Nova Scotia 's Department of Education proclaims : " Most students who require special education services can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue no longer is whether most students with exceptional needs should or should not be integrated , but what support is needed for integration to be successful . " In British Columbia , a ministerial order from 1989 declared , " Unless the educational needs of a handicapped student indicate that the student 's educational program should be provided otherwise , a board shall provide that student with an educational program in classrooms where that student is integrated with other students who do not have handicaps . " Echoes Alberta 's Education department : " A regular classroom setting should be considered as the first placement option for exceptional students . " Indeed , some provinces take great pride in their moves toward this philosophy . " New Brunswick is considered to be a leader in this area , " exclaims Margaret Smith of that province 's Department of Education . " We 're the only province that hasintroduced legislation in 1986 to provide access to public education for all students , meaning we are moving to full integration . " Smith is adamant about the province 's commitment : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financially or philosophically . We have a legal requirement to integrate special needs students , and we 're living up to that responsibility , and to our belief that all children can learn . " The universal decree  --  at least from the top - is that integration is here to stay . Sobering Statistics on Special Needs Statistics Canada estimates that approximately ten percent of Canadians have some form of disability . That 's nearly three million of us . The Canadian Association for Community Living , a national group dedicated to " developing communities that welcome people with intellectual disabilities , " says 815,000 Canadians have " some degree of difficulty learning , conceptualizing and adapting to social situations "  --  and that one in five Canadians knows one of those people , whether as a friend , relative , neighbour or co - worker . Ultimately , this is an issue that touches us all . Fourteen percent of Canadians with various disabilities who are between the ages of 15 and 40 - - nearly 90,000  --  have obtained only primary - level education , most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true of only 4.8 percent of non - disabled people in the same age group . Over 70 percent of the half - million people with disabilities who have only primary - level education , have dropped out of the labour force , most for 18 months or longer ; many others were never able to enter it in the first place . Over one million Canadians of working age with disabilities never graduated from high school , nearly half of whom ( 47.8 percent ) have been outside the labour force for 18 months or longer . Most of the 220,000 children with severe mental disabilities , such as autism , are still excluded from regular schools , and 80 percent of all adults with such disabilities have annual incomes of below $7,000 . <p>
