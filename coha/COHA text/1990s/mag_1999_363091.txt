It 's the 1950s  --  the last time , we nostalgically think , when the American middle-class narrative was coherent , predictable : everyone in his place and a preordained place for everyone . <P> This was , of course , an illusion , maybe even a dangerous one . It is writer-director Barry Levinson 's business in Liberty Heights to shatter that illusion , pick up the shards and rearrange them into a somewhat more realistic , though scarcely revolutionary , pattern . The result is a loose , lively , lovely film that enfolds everything in its embrace from the death of burlesque to the birth of rock ' n ' roll , but is mostly concerned with the ways in which Jews , blacks and Wasps , most of them more puzzled than angry , take their first wary , halting steps out of ethnic isolation . <P> The setting is again the Baltimore , Md. , of Levinson 's youth , source of Diner , Tin Men and Avalon . This time his alter ego is a smart , sweet-souled teenager named Ben ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Jewish enclave , is astonished to discover that most of the world is not , after all , Jewish . That 's particularly true of Sylvia ( the uncannily cool , wise and beautiful Rebekah Johnson ) , who is one of the token blacks in his newly integrated school . Their relationship is handled with great delicacy ; this is a friendship that yearns to be , deserves to be , richer . But  --  and this may be the most poignant thing about Liberty Heights  --  these kids are ahead of a time that is still waiting to happen , a time when people will be sympathetically supported when they try to speak gently , lovingly across the color line . <P> Sylvia 's doctor father sternly forbids contact between them ; it endangers his hard-won position . Ben 's father Nate ( Joe Mantegna ) is distractedly against it too , though most of his attention is focused on his two troubled businesses  --  a failing burlesque house and a numbers racket threatened by an obstreperous black man named Little Melvin ( Orlando Jones ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a historical nanosecond away . <P> Little Melvin will bring Nate  --  a decent guy despite his shabby work  --  to an uncomfortable end . Indeed , no one in this movie gets what he or she really wants or deserves . Even the romance between Ben 's older brother Van ( Adrien Brody ) and his Wasp princess Dubbie ( Carolyn Murphy ) ends badly , when her ethereal perfection turns out to be only skin- ( and coiffure- ) deep . <P> But somehow that does n't matter . Neither does the fact that Levinson packs his movie with more melodrama  --  including Little Melvin 's kidnapping of Ben and Sylvia from an early rock concert  --  than you would think it could hold . What 's important is the casual , even digressive , movement of the piece . It plays like a memoir , not a conventional three-act movie . There 's room here for Ben to shock his family by dressing as Hitler for Halloween , for a faux-naive stripper to electrify Nate 's theater , for the strange power of a new-model Cadillac to cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Liberty Heights seems to encompass all the humor , sadness and weirdness of ordinary life in an utterly winning , morally acute way .
