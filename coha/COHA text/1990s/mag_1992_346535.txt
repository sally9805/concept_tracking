The Secrets of the Universe may have to wait . Last week the House voted to ax most of next year 's $483.7 million funding for the superconducting supercollider , designed to be the world 's biggest atom smasher . The collider is meant to reveal the mysteries of the sub-sub-atomic world by crashing particles together inside an 86-km ( 54-mile ) oval tunnel that will literally surround the town of Waxahachie , Texas . But it also bears the world 's biggest price tag : $8.3 billion all told , and rising . That was too super for even the House . <P> The Senate may differ , and the President certainly does , so the collider could make a comeback . But mixed feelings on the Hill could scare away the Japanese , whose hoped-for investment in the project has already proved a tough sell . And if it does n't survive , the secrets of the universe could be unraveled anyway : a European lab is working on a collider that is nearly as powerful .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
