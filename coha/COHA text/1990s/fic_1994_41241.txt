They had the air conditioner on Hi Cool and the whole downstairs smelled of roasting turkey . Friday afternoon . Finn sat in the blue armchair , which rested on Teflon wafers to protect the floor he 'd finally gotten around to sanding and refinishing . With spar varnish , not that damnable polyurethane . He was reading , of all things , Timon of Athens , which he had remembered as being much better . So this would probably be the last time in his life he would read Timon of Athens ; that made it seem sad and precious , if not especially enjoyable . As he read , he also worried : that there would be too many leftovers , that Thanksgiving dinner in July was n't charming but simply outre , that none of the guests would know he 'd been interested in American cooking before it had become fashionable , and that he had been boring James by saying so repeatedly . <p> James sat cross-legged in the maroon armchair with his earphones on . Among the few possessions he 'd brought along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape . Lately he 'd been reading  --  if that was the word  --  Edgar Allan Poe . <p> " Plugged-in and passive , " he 'd said . " I 'm the first to admit it . The MTV generation . Before your very eyes . " Affected decadence was one of James 's comic turns . <p> " But Poe ? " Finn had said . <p> " It 's camp , what can I say ? " said James . " I thought all faggots were into camp back in your day . " <p> On the floor by his chair James had set a sweating glass of seltzer . He was forever setting his glass on the floor and Finn was forever nagging ; today especially he should just bite his tongue . He 'd invited Peter and Carolyn , of course , and some people from the Drama Department  --  Bill and Deborah Whitley , Byron Solomon  --  although he 'd told no one it was an occasion . An anniversary , for James and Finn , could only be the anniversary of one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it chickenshit  --  about shoving in people 's faces what they did n't want to know . They 'd decided to make today their anniversary , although it could also have been yesterday ; by the time that had become important it was too late to pin it down . James had gone to the library and looked at the microfiche to check the movie ads in the paper that week . Rebecca and Notorious had been Wed-Thur , but they could n't decide which it had been . For once Finn had n't been teaching summer school and James said ( his decadent routine again ) that he had n't cared what day of the week it was since the last time he 'd held a job . <p> James 's sister Carolyn lived on the next street , one house over from Finn 's : their backyards touched at a single point . A year ago today  --  or yesterday  --  Finn had been out back taking down , at long last , the swing set that had been there when he 'd bought the place . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing in the ground ; it lay on its side like a dog killed by a car , two stiff legs in the air . He was trying to decide whether it could be knocked apart with the hammer or whether he 'd have to take a hacksaw to it when he noticed this  --  Finn hated the expression " young man "  --  dressed only in shorts and running shoes mowing the Sykes 's lawn . Finn nodded and received a nod in return . Carolyn had forewarned him that her brother would be coming up to stay in the house for a few days while she and Peter were in Umbria , and encouraged him to go over and introduce himself . It seemed uncivil not to make use of this opportunity , but the brother 's very good looks made Finn disinclined . That night , Wed or Thurs , he went to what he still thought of as the Central but was now called the Symposium : the musty , velvety old theater in town had become a revival house with air-popped popcorn and a beer-and-wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were getting tired of VCRs . Ahead of him in the ticket line was the young man . When he turned away from the window with his ticket , he saw Finn , smiled and nodded , and walked over . <p> " I think you 're Finn McCarthy , " he said . <p> " Well , that makes one of us , " said Finn . " However . Yes . And I think you 're the person who was so diligently mowing the Sykes 's lawn this afternoon . " <p> " James Chase , " said the young man . " Carolyn 's brother . " <p> " Yes , Carolyn had prepared me , " said Finn . " Somewhat . " Should he have ? Well , it was said now . " I ought to have come over and said hello , but I was preoccupied . " <p> " You did look kind of menacing with your sledgehammer , " said the young man . <p> " That was my John Henry mode , " said Finn . " Otherwise I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking after the old homestead while they traipse around sunny Italy . " <p> " It did n't take much euchring , " said James Chase . " It was this or muggy Manhattan . Carolyn told me I should be sure and look you up . " <p> " Ah , " said Finn . " Here , why do n't we go in ? " Was he overreacting , or was this a bit gauche of Carolyn Sykes , to have steered this obviously gay boy in his direction when the first move , if any , ought to have been Finn 's ? On the other hand , he could n't afford to think ill of Carolyn Sykes : except for poor Byron Solomon , and of course now the Whitleys , Peter and Carolyn were as close as Finn had to friends in this community . As Carolyn undoubtedly knew . Which was why she had taken such a liberty . Although she had surely meant well . ( There : he was coming around already . ) And as to the boy 's being obviously gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing eye ? Did Carolyn herself know it ? One 's family had a gift for not knowing these things , or so it had been in Finn 's family . This brother of Carolyn 's was certainly presentable  --  whatever he meant by that  --  and obviously conversable . <p> When the lights came up at intermission , Finn turned to James Chase and said , " I 'm going to give Rebecca a miss , I think . I remember this as being the better of the two , and even this is starting to show its age . All this malarkey about how magical the two of them are together . Did n't seem so bloody magical to me . Ingrid Bergman reconciles me to living in the age of Julia Roberts . " <p> " It really was n't all that hot , was it ? " said James Chase . " God , I feel like a heretic . " <p> " Bracing , is n't it ? " said Finn . " Tell you what . Since you 're new in town . There happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old features pretty much intacta . And they make a mean rice pudding . And there 's a jukebox thing in every booth , with all sorts of marvelous old songs . It still has ' Ring of Fire . ' Do you know ' Ring of Fire ? ' Johnny Cash ? " <p> " I must have heard it , " said James Chase . " But , you know . I 'm into Garth . Mr. Va Va Voom . " <p> " Well then , " said Finn . " We must educate you . Are you game ? " <p> " Always , " he said . <p> From the diner they went back to Finn 's house , to hear " White Circle " by Kitty Wells , which Finn insisted was a minor masterpiece . He opened a bottle of wine , and soon he heard himself calling Willie Nelson a " nasty old bird , " and was aware for the millionth goddamn time that he tended to sound like an old queen when he 'd been drinking . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finn had stopped doing this kind of thing years ago , and James , it turned out , had promised himself that he had not come up here to cruise . And he had sworn off older men . <p> Later that same night  --  actually it was beginning to turn gray outside the windows  --  when they got around to comparing stories , Finn 's misgivings came back more sharply . James had been vague about his involvements in New York , but from what Finn could gather it was clear that he might really have been taking his life in his hands with this boy . But truly , was n't AIDS simply the extreme , the mortal , instance of what had always been the case : that your new love 's irrevocable past determined your future ? But this James was his first adventure  --  was it possible ?  --  since he 'd moved here . Finn was so out of touch that he did n't even have a condom in the house . James , thank God , had come equipped ( despite what he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the flamboyantly heterosexual boys of Finn 's high-school days . <p> Finn found James 's coming-out story unsettling , too . His own announcement to his parents ( he 'd been forty ; they 'd been too old to hear it ) had been like something out of a sensitive made-for-TV film : the father 's anger , the mother 's self-castigation . James had been in his last year of high school ; he 'd soaked the labels off of a Fibber McGee and Molly cassette and stuck them on a tape called To Sergeant ( which purported to be a recording of randy Marines in the barracks ) , then wrapped it and put it under the Christmas tree . As James told the story , his parents had waited to play it until his Aunt Alice showed up for Christmas dinner , and she had been so shocked that her dentures fell out . Finn suspected he 'd invented at least part of this : Aunt Alice was clearly a stock character , a Margaret Dumont or an Edna May Oliver . And it may or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him across the mouth had been the pretext for James 's quitting school and moving to New York . But true or not , the story made Finn feel both excited and intimidated , the way he had felt as a child when Ricky Morrison had seduced him into playing with matches . From the can Finn 's father had kept in the toolshed , Ricky had poured out a wide circle of gasoline onto McCarthy 's lawn and tossed match after match until it roared up . It left a telltale ring of charred grass which Finn rubbed at in vain with the soles of his sneakers ; he 'd caught holy hell , named his accomplice and that was the end of his friendship with Ricky Morrison . <p> That first night , with Kitty Wells keening , it had been James who committed himself first : he took a deep breath , put a warm hand on the back of Finn 's neck and pulled him close . Yet it had been James who had said , " I want to put this on you , can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had all the power . That is , if you believed it was all about who fucked who . <p> James 's Walkman gave a snap . Finn looked up from his book and saw him take off the earphones , stretch his arms up over his head and stand up . " The willies , " he said . " So what time are people supposed to be arriving ? " <p> Finn , still holding his book , rolled his wrist to check his watch . Ten after four , which of course had no bearing on the question . " I told ' em all six o'clock , " he said . " I hate this malarkey where you have one coming at six o'clock and one at six-fifteen and so forth . " It was endearing that anyone could still get the willies from Edgar Allan Poe . <p> " Six o'clock , " said James . " Listen , if you do n't mind I think I 'm going to go up and nap for a little . Will you come wake me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What time ? " he said , hoping he did n't sound disapproving . He 'd gotten up at three in morning to take a piss ; when he came downstairs for a swallow of wine from the refrigerator he 'd found James in the study watching Star 80 . The room had stunk of pot . <p> " I 'll leave that , " said James , " to your discretion . " <p> Oh . <p> " Actually I might come up and join you , " said Finn . " I 'm pretty much at a stopping-place . Just let me baste Junior again . " <p> " Do n't feel obliged , " said James . <p> " Now what 's all this ? " said Finn . <p> James shook his head . <p> " Nothing , " said James . " I must be on the rag . " <p> Oh fine , Finn thought . So now it was up to him whether to allow James to set in a jab for free or whether to turn this into another battle royale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should just drop it . But . But but but . <p> " Am I being unreasonable ? " said Finn . Like a damn fool . " To want to know what I 'm being told ? " <p> " You 're never unreasonable , " said James . <p> " And what is that supposed to mean ? " <p> " What I said , " said James . " You 're never unreasonable . I am unreasonable . As we all know . " <p> Finn closed his eyes for a count of three and blew out his breath for James to hear . <p> " Now I 've done it , " said James . " Enter the Bickersons . " <p> " Why are you doing it ? " said Finn . <p> " What a reasonable question , " said James . " Why does n't James just go take his nap and wake up cheerful and refreshed ? If there 's anything the world does n't need it 's another scene with the bitchy faggots trying to keep it together in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm concerned about , " said Finn . <p> " Right , " said James . He started up the stairs , then stopped and looked back . " Hey Finn ? " he said . " You would be welcome to tuck me in . " <p> Finn decided . " O.K. , " he said . " Just let me deal with Junior . " <p> James started up the stairs again . As his feet disappeared from sight he called back , " Do n't be too long . " <p> Finn closed Timon of Athens , not bothering to mark his place , and got up . Truly , that turkey smelled splendid . On his way into the kitchen he picked up James 's Walkman from where he 'd left it on the floor . Which story had given James the willies ? Finn hit Eject and saw it was n't the Poe at all , but just a tape tape . On the label someone had written " WORKOUT MUSIC/C . LAUPER ETC . " The name seemed antiquated , even to Finn : was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded , and it was n't James 's . <p> Finn McCarthy was a maker of documentary films . Or had been until six years ago , when he was looking for a place to land and was approached by the college 's Department of Communication Arts . That was the year his film about children 's street games had been nominated for an Academy Award . He 'd meant to show these children ( filmed in Newark , Liverpool , Mexico City and Connecticut ) as members of a savage tribe with alien customs and ceremonies ; it had bothered him , therefore , that two of the three reviews he 'd gotten had called it " sensitive . " For whatever reason , he had n't been able to get going on a new project since . It was his course load , his inability to travel . It was the too-comfortable life here : dinner parties with tolerant acquaintances in a tolerant college town . It was his house , the first he 'd ever owned , which had needed everything done to it . It was James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new project in mind . Which would damn well not be called " sensitive , " either . And which would get him once and for all , at the age of fifty-two , out of the closet , not that he was truly in the closet . ( James gave him guff about that , but that was just James . ) Finn had ignored the whole Stonewall business and everything thereafter ; bully for them , of course , but . He was damned if he 'd be ghettoized as a quote unquote gay filmmaker ; his work was not political . Lately , though , he was beginning to wonder whether avoiding the subject of homosexuality in his films  --  well , not avoiding , just not obsessing  --  had n't been a mistake . A mistake aesthetically . When he looked at his old work nowadays ( which was n't often ) it felt impersonal to him . Put-together to a fare-thee-well , of course . But surely there was a way to get closer in without being either confessional or , God forbid , polemical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What he 'd come up with was a film about the makers of gay porno films . Which , if it worked  --  if he could get the time and the funding and of course the access  --  would be a sort of oblique self-portrait in addition to whatever else . His films had always been about subcultures : American Indians who worked building skyscrapers , a leprosarium in what was then Southern Rhodesia , country-music fans . The children and their street games . But a subculture based on being homosexual and making films : how could this not end up being his best work ? Or so he thought sometimes . <p> He 'd gone so far as to begin collecting videos ; he 'd also written part of a first draft of an essay on the implicit formal conventions of pornography . If he could finish this and get it decently published  --  he 'd try Film Quarterly first , obviously , then Sight and Sound-it might help with the funding . The biggest problem , aside from outright censorship  --  the Mapplethorpe business still had everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only be a downer : even safe-sex porn had a sort of " Masque of the Red Death " feel about it . Which was all to the good as far as the film was concerned . But it made the project a tougher sell , even with the Award nomination . If anyone still remembered it . <p> Another problem was that James was against it ; it would set things back twenty years , he said . ( Finn 's first reaction was to be flattered that James thought a film of his could have any impact at all in the world . ) " What if you were a black person ? " James had said . " Would you make a movie about welfare cheats eating watermelon in their Cadillacs ? " <p> " If I could get a grant from General Motors , " said Finn . <p> James looked at him . " It 's not funny , man . You ever stop and think about where you are ? You drive ten minutes outside this town , man , and you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there , or have n't you heard ? " <p> " You 've lived in New York too long , " said Finn . " I 've never encountered the least  --  I mean I do n't go to workingmen 's bars on <p> Saturday night , but who in his right mind does ? " <p> James was still looking at him . " You are so blind , man , " he said . Finn had never seem him this exercised . And only once before had James called him " man . " <p> That was when James had first moved in . He 'd gone down to the city for a weekend to pick up the rest of his things and the weekend had lasted until Thursday . When Finn came to get him at the airport in Albany , James 's explanation was so carelessly thin that Finn ( who 'd had a half-carafe of vile Paul Masson red wine while waiting in the lounge ) had called him a slut . <p> " Listen , man , " James had said , " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the movies . " James had had a gin and tonic on the plane . <p> " I picked you up ? " said Finn . <p> " You do n't know how lucky you are , " said James . " You 're getting a live-in slut all your own , man , complete with checkered past . Just do n't push it . " <p> This , of course , had been absolute malarkey . Finn knew what it was to be excited by beautiful bad boys , but at his age he also knew better than to let one move into his home . To take a lithe , treacherous animal to bed was one thing ; to wake up next to one was something else again . James 's good looks , in fact , had bothered Finn until he got used to them . ( One thing that had helped humanize James was when Finn walked in on him spraying Right Guard into his running shoes . ) In fact , after the first few days , Finn had been about to hint that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sister 's house . He changed his mind one afternoon when he came inside from mowing the lawn and found James in the darkened study . On the screen the little black girls from Newark were jumping double-dutch . James looked up , saw Finn in the doorway , thumbed the remote control and froze a little girl with her teeth clenched and one foot in the air . " This is amazing , " he said . " How did you get this to be so scary ? " <p> Finn dropped into his Zen pedagogical manner . " Just by looking at it , " he said . <p> " Gol-ly , professor , " said James . He looked back at the frozen image . " I wonder how you look at me , " he said . " I 'd like to be Looked at with kindness . " <p> " Of course when I first saw it listed , " Byron Solomon was saying , " I was quite humiliated . " <p> " Why ? " said Bill Whitley . " God , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Worked flatters the case , I think , " said Byron . " At any rate , I very nearly made a great fool of myself by calling them up and lacing into them about it . Jeannette , of course , talked me around . She said , ' Good heavens '  --  you remember  --  ' Good heavens , how were they to know ? ' Because naturally for mere movies I never used Byron Solomon . Never sullied the great name . " He laughed . It did n't sound bitter , and Finn wondered if that was even more depressing . " So she said , ' How were they to know , for heaven 's sake . ' You remember the way she was . " <p> " I wish I could 've known her , " said Bill Whitley , apparently meaning it as a tactful reminder . <p> " God yes , I can hear her now , " said Finn , throwing in a chuckle to boot , though in fact the imitation had sounded more like Marie Dressler than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been much of an actor . Bill Whitley , like the other newer faculty , tended to treat Byron as if he were senile , which was terribly unfair . It was true that he had slipped a bit since Jeannette died . But the man had to be sixty-five : who did n't slip ? Really , Finn should have exerted himself more to find Byron a dinner partner . But one no longer worried about pairing people of for dinners , just as one no longer worried about going boy-girl-boy-girl at table , although Finn in fact had seated Carolyn between himself and Bill Whitley , and Deborah Whitley between himself and Peter Sykes . <p> " At any rate , " said Byron , " my curiosity of course got the better of me , and down I went . And do you know , I thoroughly enjoyed myself ? In both senses . I was on screen for all of three minutes , and let me tell you I was as bad a bad guy as ever chewed the scenery . " Finn had heard Byron tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And do you know what happened ? " Finn knew . " A rousing cheer went up ? The house lights came on ! And there stood my entire class , applauding . Jeannette , it seems , had called one of my students  --  Finn , you remember her , <p> Susan somebody ? Lovely girl  --  who had in turn called the fellow at the theater and arranged the whole thing . Jeannette had been prepared to drag me there bodily , if necessary , sick as she was . Well , let me tell you , it was like the Ed Sullivan Show . Toneet in air steeyewdio audience ... " Even Byron 's Ed Sullivan was no good . <p> James was staring down at his plate for all of this , mixing together his turnips and mashed potatoes with his salad fork . Must he show his boredom so plainly ? Finn had civilized him in some respects  --  he no longer drank Kahlua , for instance  --  but his table manners were still an embarrassment . Not just the elbows , but the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to switch his fork to his right hand after cutting a piece of meat because no one had ever taught him to use his silverware properly . That , of course , was a lost cause nowadays . <p> James began mixing in his cranberries , turning the whole mess gray . Finn leaned over to Carolyn and said , " I think your brother 's attention span has reached its limit . I should never have put him between Byron and Bill . " Before Byron had gotten the floor , Bill Whitley had been holding forth on Simon Callow . Which Finn could n't help but think punningly appropriate , though to say so later to James would be a cheap shot . <p> " But God help me , " Byron Solomon was saying , " if there 's a kinescope floating around of my episode of Judge Roy Bean . Also pseudonymous . ' Law West of the Pecos . ' Now that 's one I do not care to have revealed . " <p> " Edgar Buchanan ? " cried Bill Whitley . Everyone but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose I mobilize him to help me clear , " said Carolyn to Finn . " Meanwhile you can rescue poor Deborah . " <p> Deborah Whitley , whom Finn had seated at his left , had her golden , mostly naked back to him , leaning into her conversation with Peter Sykes . Who had filled his and Deborah 's wineglasses twice now , and was speaking too low for the rest of the table to hear . He made a fist , then stretched forth the fingers like a tenor hitting a high note . Muscles bulged in his forearm : Peter Sykes was a sculptor who 'd spent the past three months working in an auto body shop to sharpen his welding skills . Deborah Whitley laughed . <p> Finn admired Carolyn for her civilized pretense that her husband was a bore , bending the unwilling ear of the large-breasted , precariously halter-topped Deborah Whitley . Carolyn 's intelligence would probably get her through until her looks began to go . Good Christ , one 's friends . <p> After dinner , Byron nodded off in Finn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he guessed he 'd better toddle along . The Whitleys had brought him , but Bill looked so crestfallen  --  Finn was flattered that he was enjoying himself but appalled by his bad manners-that Peter Sykes offered to drive Byron home . This jogged Bill into a belated sense of the decencies , and that was it for the evening : one could n't very well ask Peter and Carolyn to stay on with the Whitleys standing right there . Carolyn offered to help with the cleanup , but Finn would n't hear of it . She said she 'd be glad to . Finn said they had things well in hand . <p> " Oh , do n't be such a macho-man , " she said . " You 'll be up till all hours . " " Well ... , " said Finn . <p> " Shoo , " said James . " No girls allowed . " <p> " If you 're sure , " said Carolyn . <p> James rolled his eyes . " Ve vant , " he stage-whispered , " to be alone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After closing the door on all of them , Finn turned to James and said , " There was no need to be brutal . Could n't you see she was upset ? " <p> " What ? " said James . " What are you talking about now ? " <p> " Oh come , " said Finn . " Even you could n't have missed what was going on at dinner . I assure you your sister took note . " <p> " What , Stanley Kowalski and Little Bo Peep ? " he said . " Oh for God 's sake . Parties are for flirting . That 's what they 're about . I mean when there 's anybody there under fifty . Or was n't it like that back in your day ? " <p> " This was a social evening , " said Finn , hating this tone he was being maneuvered into taking . " I do n't regard that as giving people license to hurt other people 's feelings . " <p> " Ooh , " said James . " Well I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken . " He walked into the kitchen with that walk Finn hated . That goddamn faggot walk , where the shoulders did n't move . The fourth bottle of Montalcino  --  Finn also hated white wine  --  had just about that much left . He picked it up , glanced at the kitchen doorway , and polished it off . What would the Italian be for A meme la bouteille ? He carried the dead soldier into the kitchen , not even looking at James ( who fetched a loud sigh as he bent over the dishwasher ) , and on through into the mud-room , where he dropped it , clank , in with the green glass . All this environmental malarkey was accomplishing exactly nothing  --  Was he the only one who noticed it hardly snowed up here in the winter anymore ?  --  except to give a bunch of small people the power to tyrannize you when you went to the dump .

" Did n't you see me out back with my trusty wheelbarrow ? That bloody sandpile is finally going the way of the swing set . This time next year we 'll have a civilized backyard , by Jesus . " He hated saying " we " to Carolyn , but " I " would have been worse . " Did the Rinaldi children really play on that flimsy little swing set ? " <p> " And every place else , " said Carolyn .

Only the rattle of a matchbook . <p> " There was a message on the machine when we got home last night , " said Carolyn .

Like later on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think he really is very ill . I just  --  something just tells me that . " <p> " I 'll go upstairs right now , " he said . " And you 'll let me know if there 's anything further I can do . " <p> " I will , " she said . " Thank you . " <p> " Ciao , " he said , and stood up to put the receiver back in the cradle . <p> " So what 's going on ? " said James . Finn turned : James was standing , barefoot , in the archway leading to the dining room . <p> " I did n't realize you were up , " said Finn . " That was Carolyn . It seems your father has gone in for some tests , and they 're not certain at this point what if anything is wrong . But apparently your mother is quite upset , and your sister seems to think it sounds serious enough that she thinks you ought to get in touch with them . " <p> " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , Jamie , " said Finn . " That would be up to you . " <p> James went to the refrigerator , took out the carton of orange juice and drank from it . " Sort of tests are we talking about ? " <p> " Again , " said Finn , and spread his hands , palms up . A long ash fell off his cigarette and he saw it shatter softly on the floor . " It seems to be some sort of , colo-rectal thing . " <p> " That figures , " said James . " So we 're talking about cancer . " <p> " Again , " said Finn . <p> James said , " I want to talk to my sister . " <p> The test results were n't in until the following Saturday ; on Sunday morning Finn drove James to Albany . He put James 's ticket on his Discover card , and got him two hundred dollars , the daily limit , from a cash machine . After a goodbye hug at the gate , Finn walked back out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the plane out of sight . Watched himself watch the plane out of sight . <p> The drive down to JFK used to take Finn four and a half hours ; today it had taken five . He no longer had the energy  --  no , the foolhardiness  --  to roll seventy and seventy-five all the way . Even so , he was half an hour early , so he tried to get comfortable on the narrow aluminum ledge of a giant window near the security station , and to involve himself in the last act of Timon of Athens . He 'd deliberately brought nothing else : damned if he would allow himself to get that far and not finish . But how was he to concentrate ? About fifty other people were clustered here , including whole families with whining children ; some sat against the wall , some paced , some just stood and shifted their weight from foot to foot . Only ticket-holders were being allowed to go through security and down to the gates where there were seats . And ordinary people , waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all because  --  well , enough . It was unattractive to be querulous . <p> He 'd driven all the way down here because James could n't find <p> direct flight . Getting to Albany would have involved shuttling from JFK to La Guardia , sitting at La Guardia for another two hours  --  ridiculous . If the lights started to bother Finn 's eyes on the drive back , they could always stop and put up at a motel . He 'd also driven all the way down here because he wanted to make another foray into Times Square . <p> James had seemed in fine fettle on the telephone , but now that it was certain the old man ( he was five years older than Finn ) had only months to live , God knows what buried feelings were bound to come out . Finn was truly sorry for James : he himself had been forty-five before he 'd had to go through this . But he hoped that whatever James had to go through  --  and he was ashamed of how selfish this sounded  --  he hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half James had been gone , Finn had written another three pages of his essay and had composed the covering letter . No doubt James would be upset that he intended to run an errand  --  particularly this errand  --  before going home . Damn : had he not taken so much wine last night , he would 've been able to get up earlier , to finish picking up the house earlier , and to make his stop before coming to the airport . But if there had to be a showdown , then there would be a showdown . This was his only life , and there was only so much of it left . <p> He could n't concentrate on Timon of Athens . <p> At last passengers with suitcases and garment bags began straggling down the long passage from the gates to the security station . No one had even bothered to announce the arrival : the slipshod way everything was run these days would make a saint querulous . Yet he must n't visit this querulousness on James , who would need his support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , his canvas duffel bag slung from his shoulder , and in his other hand  --  what ? A net bag of oranges . <p> Finn gave him a brotherly one-armed hug . James bent to lay the oranges on the floor , straightened up , gripped the back of Finn 's neck and kissed him on the lips . <p> " This is New York City , " said James . " Remember ? " <p> " Forgive an old man , " said Finn , giving his still-one-armed hug another pump . " When ye git my age , sonny .... " <p> " If , " said James . <p> Finn let go . James 's tan , he noticed , was even deeper than when he 'd left . So something more had been going on , apparently , than just the compulsive TV-watching and the silent family dinners he 'd re-created so amusingly on the phone . <p> " Ah , nature 's bounty , " said Finn , bending to pick up the oranges . <p> " My mother insisted , " said James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of us . " <p> " Well well well , " said Finn . " God and sinners reconciled . But would n't pink grapefruit have been more appropriate ? " <p> James began walking . The sight of his firm buttocks under his white shorts made Finn suddenly furious . <p> " Your tan looks splendid , " he said , catching up . " So how are the beach girls down there ? Really stacked , I 'll bet . " <p> James stopped . People went by on both sides , paying no attention . <p> " Hey Finn ? " said James . " Why do n't you give it a rest , O.K. ? I 'm just really not up to it . It 's been a bad week . " <p> " Yes , I can see it must have been hell , " said Finn , appalled that he could n't shut up . <p> " I do n't believe this is happening , " said James . " I 've been off the plane for two minutes and already we 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , Jamie , " said Finn . " I do n't know what the hell 's wrong with me . " <p> " Can we not stand here in the middle of all this ? " <p> " Sorry . Here . " He touched James 's shoulder to guide him . " We 're parked down this way . " <p> They walked a few steps towards the escalator and James stopped again . " Look , " he said , " would you rather I just took a cab into the city and got out of your life ? " <p> " Jamie , I 'm truly  --  " <p> " Because I do n't seem to be making you very happy , and you 're driving me out of my mind . " <p> " You 're shouting , " said Finn . <p> " What , these people have never seen a pair of bickering faggots before ? " Well , he was shouting now , at any rate . <p> " James , " said Finn . " For Christ 's sake . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said James . " Well my parents have a pool , man . In their backyard . Which is where I sat for nine days , man , watching game shows with my mother . She keeps a TV out there so she can work on her tan . She looks like distressed leather . My father , meanwhile , sits in the den with the blinds closed watching , I kid you not , old Super Bowl games on his VCR . He 's got tapes of all but four of however fucking many Super Bowls there are . And he 's scared shitless and he eats so much Valium his flesh is turning to balsa wood . " <p> " I 'm so sorry , " said Finn . <p> " Look , " said James , " do you mind very much if we get out of here ? " <p> In the parking garage , Finn unlocked the passenger door first . James in turn reached over and unlocked the driver 's door , which Finn took as a sign of conciliation . He decided not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stroked the back of James 's head . James allowed it . <p> When they came out into the sunlight  --  it was still only five o'clock  --  Finn put on the air conditioning . James had taught him that it was more fun to keep the windows open when the air was on , even though it was n't fuel-efficient . On the Grand Central , traffic in the other direction was motionless , but inbound it was moving right along . <p> " I hate to backseat-drive , " said James , " but should n't we be in the other lane ? " <p> " Ordinarily , " said Finn . " But I need to make a quick stop-off in midtown . " <p> " For what ? " <p> Finn drew a long breath , let it out . " For something you do n't approve of , " he said . <p> " Oh , " said James . He looked at his watch . " You know it 's going to take hours to get in and out of Manhattan at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your way ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , " said Finn . " I 'll make this as quick as I possibly can , but I get to the city So seldom that I really must n't pass up the chance . " <p> " So this is why you were so anxious to come down and pick me up , " said James . " Tell me something . Do you ever think your tastes might be a little depraved ? " <p> " We 've been over this , " said Finn . <p> " Well let me put it in another light for you , " said James . " Did it ever occur to you that it might be insulting to me ? " <p> They were caught behind a huge yellow school bus . The lanes on either side were n't moving any faster , but Finn cut to the left in front of a cab  --  the driver leaned on his horn  --  just to get behind something he could see past . <p> " You 're not going to provoke me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I respect your view . I 'm asking you to respect mine . " <p> " Project ? " said James . " What project ? This is n't a project , for Christ 's sake . It 's one more old queen who likes to watch young dudes get it on . You can dignify it because you used to be some hot-shit filmmaker . " <p> Finn looked over at him , this idle boy with his dirty blond hair blowing . Who made him waste his time and now held him in contempt for it . He had let himself become an aging man with no family , who no longer prepared before meeting his classes and whose taste for good wines was giving him broken veins in his nose . He was this young man 's sugar daddy . He turned back in time to avoid ramming the BMW ahead of him by lifting his foot quickly from the gas pedal : to hit the brakes would call James 's attention to his bad driving . <p> " For whatever reason , " said Finn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have done almost no work in the time I 've known you . This is going to come to a screeching halt . " <p> " You have n't done any work for five years , man , " said James . Seven , thought Finn . <p> " I 'm not putting it off on you , " he said . The pounding was now in his throat . " But I wo n't allow you to interfere with what I need to do . " James said nothing . " And I might add that it might be time for you to start thinking about what you 're going to do when you grow up . It 's a waste of life , and it depresses me severely . " <p> " Would you like me to go to night school , " said James , " and study hairdressing ? " <p> " That , my dear , is up to you , " said Finn . " What I mean to do is to make a stop in midtown . For one hour , no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're coming . " <p> " Finn , " said James . " It 's your car , it 's your life . I do n't really have anything to say about it . " <p> " Now if you 'd prefer , " said Finn , " it is getting late-ish . We could have dinner in the city , leave when the traffic 's thinned out , and maybe put up for the night somewhere along the way . " <p> James did n't answer . Finn looked and saw that he was crying . Not sobbing , just letting the tears go down his face . <p> " Just please do what you 're going to do , " said James . " All I want is to get home . " <p> James had been back almost a week before Finn had time to sit down and go through the videos he 'd bought in Times Square . Made time , he corrected himself . But James had come down with a summer cold , Finn did have to nurse him , bring him ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug store for cough syrup and Comtrex . And they did have to ask Peter and Carolyn over to hear James 's report and to discuss what might have to be done in the time remaining . Which of course involved preparing a decent meal , and what with the shopping and the cooking that was another day shot to hell . And the lawn had needed another mowing : he 'd neglected it the week before . <p> But now , at last , a quiet day . James , recovered , had borrowed the car for the afternoon . Acting mysterious about it , too . Perhaps out buying a **28;0;TOOLONG gift , since before leaving he had  --  mehercule !  --  done the breakfast dishes and straightened up the bedroom . So Finn , having run out of distractions , sat alone in his study with a notepad , watching something called Hellfire Club . Two men lay side by side on a bed as cheap , nasty music went wacka wacka wacka on the sound track . One , with mustache and short hair , decked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was propped up on a pillow angrily puffing a cigarette . The other , with a platinum-dyed Mohawk , wore only a black leather collar with diamond-shaped silver studs . He lay face-down , his body a uniform dingy white ; you could see the sores on his legs . ( At least this film was n't arty . ) The leather one took a final drag , tapped off the final ash and stubbed his cigarette out on the Mohawk one 's white buttock . The Mohawk one twitched , then lay still again . <p> Finn suddenly felt sick to his stomach : these were only the opening minutes of a sixty-minute film . He hit Stop and the screen went snowy . Was his discomfort a sign that here was something worth his attention ? Had he needed to turn the thing off because it was too powerful ? Or was it just ugly and frightening , period , without significance ? Why did these films fascinate him ? Did they fascinate him , or was he in fact burned out and desperately willing himself to be fascinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions was to work . Unless it was one more way not to work . <p> Perhaps the thing to do was to look at something less harrowing and allow his unconscious to process this . <p> He ejected Hellfire Club , put it back in its case , and looked through the rest of the new ones . Well , what about Sean in Love ? If nothing else , it ought to be sensitive . Perhaps instead of films that were manifestly sordid , you wanted to look at the capital-S sensitive ones and spot the details that showed they were sordid , too . Or was that too easy ? Probably that was too easy . <p> The premise of Sean in Love was that " Sean , " a Wall Street type  --  there was some malarkey at the beginning about " mergers "  --  took an island vacation and kept falling for lifeguards , Rastas and what-not . He would gape at them , then the image would go wavy and dissolve ( harp glissando on the sound track ) to show that what followed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sauna getting fucked by a Nautilus instructor  --  it seemed to Finn that the wooden bench must have been hell on his back and shoulders  --  when there was a cut to outside the door ( through which their stagy moans could still be heard ) where a third young man , in tight shorts , was reaching for the door handle . ( This annoyed Finn : up to now the fantasies had been presented strictly from Sean 's point of view . ) " Oopsy-daisy , " said the intruder  --  and Finn leaned forward . Cut from their surprised faces to the smiling face of the intruder : James , of course , of course , of course . Younger , but James . Finn had never been fool enough to think that particular smile had been turned on no one but him . He watched the scene through to the end , with its combinations and recombinations . All very predictable . <p> Finn was still sitting in his study when he heard the car pull in . He 'd smoked all but one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'd tossed the pack with the last cigarette inside it onto the floor just out of reach ; that way he would n't smoke it until he really needed it . Well , now he would take the keys from James , saying as little as possible  --  he hoped James had n't in fact brought a present  --  drive over to the Cumberland Farms for a fresh pack , and maybe by the time he got back he would have figured out what to do next . He heard the screen door slap and James calling " Hey , anybody home ? " <p> He stood up and felt suddenly lightheaded . He 'd been sitting there ever since  --  ever since . He opened the door and saw James coming through the kitchen . The living room between them , with its narrow glossy floorboards , looked as vast as a basketball court . <p> " So guess what ? " said James . <p> " Suppose you just tell me , " said Finn . <p> " I will , " said James . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was choosing not to pick it up , in order to make his own mood prevail . " You 're looking at a productive citizen . " <p> " A productive citizen , " said Finn . <p> " Well , a soon-to-be productive citizen . I 've got a job . " <p> " Do you , " said Finn . He remained standing in the doorway . James went over and sat down in the maroon armchair , draping one leg over the side and letting the foot swing . <p> " Well , are n't you curious ? " said James . <p> Finn said nothing . <p> " I would 've thought you 'd be pleased , " said James , who now seemed to be catching on . <p> Finn thought for a second . " I can understand that , " he said . <p> " What 's up ? " said James . His foot stopped moving . " Oh Jesus , " he said . " My dad " <p> " Say again ? " said Finn . Then he remembered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no news of your dad . " <p> " Jesus , " said James . " You scared the hell out of me . So listen , do you want to hear this or not ? " <p> Finn stretched forth his hands as if supplicating and let them drop . <p> " Fire away , " he said . <p> " Well , " said James , " There was an ad in the paper that they were looking for an assistant manager at the Symposium . So I went down and checked it out . You know , because I thought it would be like running the popcorn machine . But it 's actually a serious job , like bookkeeping and shit . I will have to run the ticket window , but he said I 'd have some input on the programming and I 'll definitely be writing some of the little synopses in the schedule , and it 's just  --  I think it 's really going to be good . " <p> " You 've taken a job , " said Finn . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , and laughed . <p> " Right , " said Finn . <p> " So anyhow , I promise that every July I 'll get them to run our Hitchcock movies again that we did n't like . God , " he said , " I 'm getting sentimental in my old age . " <p> " Perhaps you could make it a triple feature , " said Finn . " With Sean in Love . " <p> James cocked his head . " I do n't get it . " <p> " Sean in Love , " said Finn . " It 's a video I picked up in Times Square . I think it would interest you greatly . " <p> James took a deep breath and let it out . <p> " Oh , " he said . " Always wondered what they ended up calling that thing . " <p> " So what do they pay for work like that ? " said Finn . <p> " They paid me a hundred dollars . Which I needed very badly at the time . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A hundred dollars , " said Finn . " Did you enjoy your work ? " <p> " Did you ? " said James . " What do you want me to tell you ? That they were holding a gun to my head like Linda Lovelace ? You know , I was eighteen , and this friend of mine asked me if I wanted to be with him in this movie  --  " <p> " Which friend was that ? " <p> " He was supposed to be playing this exercise teacher or something , " said James . " He actually as an exercise teacher . I used to go to his workout . " <p> " I can imagine , " said Finn . <p> " Maybe you ought to sit down , " said James . " You look really pale . " <p> Finn walked to the blue armchair  --  his footsteps seemed to echo and the journey seemed to take a long time  --  and sat down . Sparkles swam before his eyes . <p> " How many of these friends of yours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " are dead ? " <p> " How would I know ? " said James . " This was one afternoon , Like five years ago . Do n't you think I think about it every day ? Plus all the other stupid shit ? " He reached into his jacket pocket and tossed Finn first a book of matches , then an unopened pack of cigarettes . " You know , everybody 's got dead friends , " he said . " Except you , right ? Since you do n't have friends . " <p> Finn got the pack open , worked a cigarette out of it , lit it , took a first deep , wonderful drag and glanced around for an ashtray . The late afternoon sun glinted off the varnished floor . He became conscious of the faraway drone of somebody 's lawnmower ; for a second there he thought of nothing at all . Then he realized he was staring at the overlapping white rings by the side of James 's chair . <p> " So , " he said . " I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my project . " <p> " One reason , yes , " said James . <p> " Why did n't you simply tell me ? " <p> " Because look at you , " he said . " You know , I know about men who like naughty boys . And the bottom line is , that they do n't like ' em to be too naughty . So . " quick shrug . " What ? Would you like me to go over and stay at Carolyn 's while I make other arrangements ? " <p> Touching up just that little bit of floor , Finn thought , would be simplicity itself . <p> " I do n't know what I would like at this point , " he said . " I would like to believe that none of this really happened . " <p> " Oh , " said James . " Well if that 's all . You can manage that O.K. Whether I 'm around or not . I imagine you 've already started . " <p>         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
