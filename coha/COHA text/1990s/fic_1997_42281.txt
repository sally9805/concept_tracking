Of the night that changed the world his memory should be clear-but the boy who nestled against the neck of the lead ox is not sure he really saw all the things he remembered . I can remember everything about that day : the wind , a light stirring of fine , sharp air ; the sky pale blue , the blue sky of a fine winter day ; the earth brown with winter . My father was busy with his brothers Manasses and Eliud . They were staying with us-Manasses with his wife and their baby in the guest room on the roof , Eliud in the room that was mine . Because of them my father stayed home from the vineyard , and for a while I stayed with him ; but I kept thinking what a good day it would be to spend with the shepherds , and after a while he told me to go . I did n't get as far as the fields , though . After I had walked down the hill , was clear of the terraces , the vineyards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shepherds were grazing their flocks on the lower slopes of the hills , I decided that the open fields would be too cold . There was a sunny corner out of the wind where old Aaron was working on his terraces just beyond our own ; he was building rough field stones into a new wall ; and I spent most of the day with him there , helping him where I could and sharing his cheese and olives . But the sun set early on the hillside below the village , and remembering this , I started for home before it began to lip the houses on the edge of the heights ; it was still shining strong and warm when I came to the gateway of our home . There I stopped , for nothing was as it should have been . My elder sister was grinding barley with the little stone mill ; the sound of it was a rich , rutty undertone that I always loved . But they had been grinding barley when I left in the morning just the same ; Leah with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands above Leah 's on the handle of the top stone . Barley enough for ourselves and our guests should have all been ground long before noon ; in our house the women were house-proud and all the public work-the carrying of water , the grinding of corn , the baking of bread and the washing of clothes-was done without interruption from earliest morning . But on this day my sisters were still grinding corn ; there was a strange little donkey in the yard , and there were people I had never seen before . The donkey was small and puny ; my father would never have bought him , for he liked a good beast . This one was tired with a long journey too ; his hoofs were worn too close ; he needed a long spell on good soft pasture . The gateway opened into the courtyard , and opposite this entrance our stable was a cave cut deep into the stone of the hillside , about eight paces deep , as the Romans count paces , and two wide . There was room enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads to the side wall , though we never had so many , and to tell the truth there were only four rings fastened to the limestone wall to take the halter ropes ; and there was no sign that there had ever been others . The living rooms of the house were raised above the courtyard ; the domed roofs of these rooms had been built up to a level to take a guest room higher again , and this had a ladder outside the outer wall to the street , so that our guests could come and go as they wished without the necessity of making polite conversation whenever they passed through the rest of the house . My father and mother were standing away from the others . They were near the gate and I could hear their voices , though they were talking privately . My father sounded troubled . " I hate to put anyone in the stable , " he said . " It 's good shelter , " said mother , deliberately offhand . " My brother deserves better treatment . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should have stayed in Jerusalem , where there are inns . He knows that Bethlehem is small and that there is no caravansary ; he must be prepared to take what we have to offer . " " It is so many years since I saw him , " my father said . " He chooses a bad time to come . Why come now ? At this time ? " " It was the census . " " The census . The census , " my mother said . " The census crowded us out before he arrived . What has the census to do with him , a Nazarene ? The census is of Judaea . " " His family is of this house . " " And Saturninus will seek him out if he does not come ? You must admit it is n't likely . " " The census is ordered by Quirinius , the commissioner ; it has nothing to do with the proconsul , " my father said . " And if it was the census that brought him , why should he bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . " Would it be safe for her to stay behind-in Nazareth ? " my father asked . He nearly sneered ; he would have , if sneering were possible to him . Nazareth had no very good reputation in Judaea . We of Judaea had very little time for any part of Galilee . " Is the highway so much safer than Nazareth ? " my mother asked . My father put his hand on her arm . " Do n't be worried , " he said . " Do n't be resentful . And do n't question what Joseph chose to do . He says the census brings him ; I am like you ; I doubt it . The Lord being good , Joseph hopes for a new son for the House of David ; he would like to see it born in Bethlehem , which was the city of David . There is nothing more than that . " " We , too , are of the House of David , " my mother said . " For my part , I 'd as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . He came through Jerusalem two hours from here ; there must have been room . " " This is the House of Bread , " my father said , " and we are not poor . We will have room for them ; only I am sorry that they must use the stable . We will turn no one away . " By the House of Bread he meant the village ; this was a name that Bethlehem was sometimes given . A tall man was coming from the stable . I had never seen him before , but I guessed this was my Uncle Joseph . He was tall and straight and bearded ; and though he was a Nazarene he had the face of a man of the open air , as though he were a shepherd , or a worker in stone . I learned later that he was a carpenter . " It 's a poor room I have for you , " my father said , but Joseph grinned cheerfully . " We 've slept in worse places , Jacob , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs according to my bed . " " Mary is near her time ? " my mother asked , and Joseph nodded . " Thanks be to God my son was not born on the road , " he said . " You 're sure it will be a boy ? " asked father , lightly . Joseph gave him a strange look . " I 'm sure , " he said . My sisters had ground the meal and now had gone away , taking the mill with them . I did n't see Joseph 's wife , except briefly , before we went for our meal . She looked very young , not as old as Leah ; and she was more quietly dressed . She was not tall , nor was she small ; her face was still , not smiling ; yet it carried the brand of happiness . She walked slowly , with a great dignity . " She is very beautiful , " my mother said , and I was startled . I had not thought of her as being beautiful . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am favored of God . " Our meal was late , very late , and when it was over I was sent straight to a bed in the courtyard , under a little dome that supported the rooms near the outer wall . My sister Leah brought me blankets from their storage in the wall ; thick woolen blankets and more than I was used to , against the chill of the night . I lay and watched the stars and I listened to the sounds : the talk from the house , the movements of cattle in the stable , and once , the tramping of a squad of Romans in the road outside . I thought I would never get to sleep ; then suddenly I was wide awake , and knew that I had been sleeping for hours . It was a cry that had wakened me , I thought , and I waited a long time as though I expected another , but none came . I was wide awake , as though I had never been asleep , and I thought I had never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serene in spite of a confusion of sounds from the stable . There was movement there ; I could see a flickering of lamps from deep inside , and there was a little bustle of people . I puzzled and puzzled ; and then I guessed : my new cousin had been born ; and I wondered whether my Uncle Joseph had been right ; whether it had been a son , for that was important to him . The men were in the house and I could hear their voices . Leah came past me to the store . She hesitated as she went past and looked down at me . I pretended to be asleep and she went on into the store and took a measure of oil from the big earthen jar ; then she picked up a dish and went back to the stable . She came out again , almost straight away , and took salt from the box where we kept it ; so then I knew that the baby had been born and that it was healthy ; because they were ready to rub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies in Bethlehem , for the town was only small ; but I had heard the women talking ; they were forever talking of babies , so that I knew what the oil and the salt were for . After a while I could n't lie there any longer , and when there had been no one moving for a while I got up and straightened the blankets behind me and hurried over to the entrance to the stable . Just inside was a place where , long before , my grandfather , or perhaps his father , had begun to widen the cave . The wall had been cut deeper here ; and then later masons had left a little stack of squared limestone blocks in the cutting , where they would be in no one 's way . It was a play-place of mine and I knew it well , so I watched my chance and when no one was looking , I slipped into the shadows amongst the stones where it would be hard to see me . With all the crowd in the stable it was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our family were all there ; they were tending Mary , my uncle 's wife , away at the end of the cave , and between them and my little alcove the cattle were stabled : our two draft oxen and our donkey ; and the two strange donkeys-the big strong one my Uncle Manasses had brought , and the little footsore beast that belonged to my Uncle Joseph . The oxen were lying down , chewing the cud . They knew me ; it was my regular chore to take them out to graze , and I could walk all over them without them stirring . The yokes and the harness hung on the wall nearby and threw a shadow ; so when I was sure that no one would see me I went up and stood there and watched . I saw the baby . Leah was holding it . It was such a tiny little red and runty thing I felt sorry for my uncle ; it was small and it had a little face and screwed-up eyes , and it was red and blotched , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful baby , " and I jumped . I looked behind me ; it was as though she had heard my thought , but no one had moved . Leah was not looking near me ; she was holding this little baby in her arms and swaying her shoulders back and forth , twisting at the waist . " He 's beautiful , he 's beautiful , " she crooned , and I knew it was a boy . She held it while my mother dressed it ; they put on a tiny shirt , a little cloth coat . They took a strip of woolen cloth and bound it round and round and round ; round his body and round his arms and legs so tight and firm I wondered how ever he could move ; they wrapped him round in another square patterned cloth and tied this on with a tape . He was like a little woolen doll . " Oh , he 's beautiful , " Leah said ; and I tried to believe her . Anna meantime had brought blankets and folded them small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feedbox cut into the limestone at the head of the end stall , where they were all gathered . It was a woolen nest in a bed of stone . I was still looking when I heard the men coming across the courtyard , and I dropped down in the darkness , into the straw . My father and my uncles walked past me to the end stall . I lay beside Speckles , our lead ox , up near his head . My family left after a while so that Joseph could talk to his wife . I would have gone , but there was too much risk they would see me , so I stayed ; but Joseph talked quietly and I could not hear what he said . When Joseph , too , came out he saw me . He stopped , and I think he smiled . I could not see his expression in the dark of the cave , and I thought perhaps he was telling me to leave , and I got up . But he patted me on the crown of my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I had come from , by Speckles " head . I think he knew I would not have cared to have my father find out I had stolen in . All this I can remember as clearly as though it were yesterday ; but from then , from the commotion at the gate that followed , it all seems like a dream , so rich and dreamlike I sometimes think I must have slept again . Yet I know I did n't ; the things happened ; they happened according to the prophecies , as my father has often told me ; and my thinking could not change them . And first were the travelers at the gate ; three simple men dressed as travelers , but in fine cloth and armed with good blades , well jeweled . What company they had I do not know ; the three men came to the stable and there was a traffic of restless beasts beyond the gates , but I do not know how big an escort came with the camels , or what kind of people they were . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the moonlit courtyard they looked like kings , and I have since heard it said that in those far countries from which they came they ruled as kings . They spoke to my father and his brothers ; and they came into the dimlit stable where the two draft oxen were , and the three donkeys , and Joseph 's wife lying in the empty stall beyond , and the babe in the rock at its head . They stood a long time near the manger , and I knelt up in the straw to watch them ; and I think I shall see it always : the great head of Speckles with his horns black against the flickering yellow light of the oil lamps , and the glorious men beyond in the light ; and they knelt to the new baby , so that he seemed to take to himself the glory that the men brought with them . I did not see , but it was true , that others had followed them into the stable . They brought gifts , and departed , quietly , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gifts and left them on the ledge at the head of the stall ; and when at last they went , the little bound figure of the babe was surrounded with frankincense and myrrh , and gifts of gold . I came forward as they were going , I do n't know why ; and stood by Speckles , near his tail . The first two men saw me and passed without saying anything ; though they smiled , I think , as well as I was able to tell in the dark . But the third paused , and put his hand on my shoulder , and said something to me ; but he spoke in Greek , I think . I could not understand it . They spoke in Greek to my father and his brothers , but only Joseph understood them ; the others had not more than a word or two ; but in Nazareth it was necessary to know the Greek tongue , for Nazareth was on the highway to Asia Minor . They spoke for a long while ; then they paid their respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek ? " my father asked . " What were the gifts for ? How did they come here ? " " They followed a star , " said Joseph . " They have followed it a long time from a strange land . " " A star ? " asked Manasses . " What star ? " He looked up at the heavens and all the stars were very bright . " A star stood in the east , and they followed it , " Joseph said . " They followed it here ? " my father asked . From his voice he must have been as I was ; he must have felt it to be a dream . " They followed it to Herod , " Joseph said . " The star was the star of the King of the Jews ; and so they followed it to Herod ; and when they found Herod , they lost the star . And Herod asked the scribes ; he asked what birthplace the prophets had foretold for the King of the Jews , and the scribes said " Bethlehem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without the star ? " Manasses asked . " They found it again , in a well . They found it on the road to Bethlehem . They had forgotten , they said , to watch the skies , and so it was shown to them , reflected in a well . And the star rose up and settled against the edge of the mountain , above this town of Bethlehem , and above this house . " " You take this steadily , that your child should be called King of the Jews , " my father said ; and Joseph answered , " I have known it a long time . " They were silent then , till Manasses , looking up , said , " I see no star ; no star I have not always known . " I came out of the cave then and looked up . The sky was a glory of stars ; but to me it was the familiar sky . My father said , " Not every man can see the same star , always . The star the wise men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It has brought some danger , too , if Herod believes this King of the Jews . " A man that can kill his own sons to keep them from the throne will soon have an army on the road to Bethlehem . " " We are safe a little while , " said Joseph . " For Herod believes the three will return , and tell him the whereabouts of the child . " " And will they ? " " They have seen the danger . Instead , they travel south to Egypt . We have some days . " I felt proud I had an uncle so calm and so strong . The men did n't see me , but went into the house . I thought I might follow them ; but I stayed , instead , looking at the sky , looking above me to see the star that stood above the house ; but in that night every star was glorious . It was near morning by that time ; there was a glow above the valleys to the east . And suddenly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooves of sheep and goats ; and while I listened the shepherds came through the open gate ; all the shepherds that I knew , all those who kept the flocks on the lower slopes of the mountains below the town . I knew them well ; sometimes they let me help them . I held shepherds in the kind of regard that boys will sometimes keep for soldiers ; I had no reason to admire soldiers , for the men of my house chafed under the Romans . They paid their taxes grudgingly ; and when they saw the Roman squadrons , armed and armored as expensively as only Romans could afford , they muttered complaints into their beards . I had no time for soldiers ; but shepherds were my heroes . They came in now , leaving their sheep and goats milling in the roadway outside the walls ; the tall , tough swaggering men of the hills , agile and nimble , willing and able to fight a bear or a pack of dogs , hardy as the goats they tended . Eli was my favorite ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood for a moment inside the gate , leaning on his staff . He was excited , wild-eyed . He had a club thrust through the goat-hair rope he wore for a girdle , a heavy strong wooden club , edged on four corners beyond the hand piece , a club polished with much handling . The girdle also carried his dagger and his sling , and his scrip , made from the skin of a black-and-white kid , stripped whole from the animal , and worn with the hair outside . There was the head of a flute protruding from the mouth of it ; and its body was bulging , so that I knew that , besides his flint and steel , it carried the olives , the figs and the barley loaves that ordinarily , on any other night , he would have finished by midnight . The others crowded in behind him . " The angel sent us all , " Eli told my father . " The angel said , Behold , I bring you tidings of great joy , joy for all people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the hill , praising the Lord . " And the others said , " Glory to God , " and sayings of that sort . The shepherds pressed into the stable , and the two oxen lurched to their feet and moved in against the wall , as though to give them room . But the donkeys in the stalls took no notice . They stood placidly , facing the corner where the light from the lamps lit the child . And it was daylight when we all came out of the stable . In the sky above there was one star shining bright ; and I wondered whether it could be the star the kings had followed , because it stood high above the house , but I could not decide . I thought it might have been a star I had seen before , a star with which I was familiar , but I never saw it so glorious . I watched the shepherds , but they paid it no particular attention . Their flocks had straggled along the road and now , unused to being driven in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleating , the goats calling on a higher note than the sheep . The shepherds separated , going to different parts of the road , and from their stands called out , naming their flocks : " Ho , White-ears ; come , Bandy . " And from the confusion in the road , sheep and goats went each to its own guardian ; and in a few minutes the men all moved off , each with his own band counted and safe . The sun was coming up . I was glad and pressed against the stone wall , for I was freezing in my shirt . When I went back into the yard my mother was talking to my father and wringing her hands . Leah was there , and my sister Anna in the background . " Imagine , " mother said . " To have put them in the stable ! A king of the Jews , the three men said ! " " Hush , woman , " said my father . " But " she said . " It is done . " He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not stay long with us ; he left one night soon after this in great secrecy ; and it was a long time before I heard that he had gone to Egypt away from the threat of Herod . And then came a sad time for Bethlehem . Yet Bethlehem is a small place , and like many of its sons I had to seek my fate away from there , and I was many years gone , so that I did not see my cousin again . But I have the memory of that night in the stable ; and some of it is very vivid , so that I can smell the fragrance of the royal gift as it overcame the sweet grasstainted breath of the oxen , the smell of the beasts , and the stable floor impregnated with manure . I can hear the rustling of mice , and see the peculiar brilliance of the moonlit yard outside , and I can hear the talk , some of the talk . Yet much of it is a confusion . Of a night that changed the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . I can not tell for certain how it was that this happened , or that ; and sometimes what I say of that night is not believed , for there is overmuch argument over simple things . Sometimes I 'm not sure that the boy , nestled against the neck of the lead ox , saw all the things that I remember . But the wonder and the glory of the night in the stable have never dimmed .
