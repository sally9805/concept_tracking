Dalkeith-Upon-the-Sea The Highlands of Scotland 1515 Grimm paused at the open doors of the study and gazed into the night . The reflection of stars dappled the restless ocean , like tiny pinpoints of light cresting the waves . Usually he found the sound of the sea crashing against the rocks soothing , but lately it seemed to incite in him a questing restlessness . As he resumed pacing , he sifted through possible reasons for his unrest and came up empty-handed . It had been by choice that he remained at Dalkeith as captain of the Douglas guard when , two years ago , he and his best friend , Hawk Douglas , left Edinburgh and King James 's service . Grimm adored Hawk 's wife , Adrienne-when she was n't trying to marry him off-and he doted upon their young son , Carthian . He had been , if not exactly happy , content . At least until recently . So what ailed him ? " You 're wearing holes in my favorite rug with your pacing , Grimm . And the painter will never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , " Adrienne teased , jarring him from his melancholy reverie . Grimm expelled a breath and ran a hand through his thick hair . Absentmindedly he fiddled with a section at his temple , twisting the strands into a plait as he continued to contemplate the sea . " You are n't looking for a wishing star out there , are you , Grimm ? " Hawk Douglas 's black eyes danced with mirth . " Hardly . And anytime your mischievous wife would care to tell me what curse she laid upon me with her careless wishing , I 'd be happy to hear it . " Some time ago , Adrienne Douglas had wished upon a falling star , and she steadfastly refused to tell either of them what she 'd wished until she was absolutely certain it had been heard and granted . The only thing she would admit was that her wish had been made on Grimm 's behalf , which unnerved him considerably . Although he did n't consider himself a superstitious man , he 'd seen enough odd occurrences in the world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render it impossible . " As would I , Grimm , " Hawk said dryly . " But she wo n't tell me either . " Adrienne laughed . " Go on with the two of you . Do n't tell me two such fearless warriors suffer a moment 's concern over a woman 's idle wish upon a star . " " I consider nothing you do idle , Adrienne , " Hawk replied with a wry grin . " The universe does not behave in a normal fashion where you 're concerned . " Grimm smiled faintly . It certainly did n't . Adrienne had been tossed back in time from the twentieth century , the victim of a wicked plot to destroy the Hawk , concocted by a vindictive Fairy . Impossible things happened around Adrienne , which was why he wanted to know what bloody wish she 'd made . He 'd like to be prepared when all hell broke loose . " Do sit down , Grimm , " Adrienne urged . " I want this portrait finished by Christmas at the latest , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Only because my work is sheer perfection , " the painter said , miffed . Grimm turned his back on the night and reclaimed his seat by Hawk in front of the fire . " I still doona get the point of this , " Grimm muttered . " Portraits are for lasses and children . " Adrienne snorted . " I commission a painter to immortalize two of the most magnificent men I 've ever laid eyes upon " - she flashed them a dazzling smile , and Grimm rolled his eyes , knowing he would do whatever the lovely Adrienne wished when she smiled like that- " and all they can do is grumble . I 'll have you know , one day you 'll thank me for doing this . " Grimm and Hawk exchanged amused glances , then resumed the pose she insisted displayed their muscular physiques and dark good looks to their finest advantage . " Be certain you color Grimm 's eyes as brilliantly blue as they are , " she instructed Albert . " As if I do n't know how to paint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unless , of course , you 'd like to try your hand at it . " " I thought you liked my eyes . " Hawk narrowed his black eyes at Adrienne . " I do . I married you , did n't I ? " Adrienne teased , smiling . " Can I help it if the staff at Dalkeith , to the youngest maid of a tender twelve years , swoons over your best friend 's eyes ? When I hold my sapphires up to the sunlight , they look exactly the same . They shimmer with iridescent blue fire . " " What are mine ? Puny black walnuts ? " Adrienne laughed . " Silly man , that 's how I described your heart when I first met you . And stop fidgeting , Grimm , " she chided . " Or is there some reason you want those braids at your temples in this portrait ? " Grimm froze , then slowly touched his hair in disbelief . Hawk stared at him . " What 's on your mind , Grimm ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized he 'd plaited the war braids into his hair . A man wore war braids only during the blackest hours of his life-when he was mourning his lost mate or preparing for battle . So far , he 'd worn them twice . What had he been thinking ? Grimm stared blankly at the floor , confused , unable to vocalize his thoughts . Lately he 'd been obsessed with ghosts of the past , memories he 'd tossed savagely into a shallow grave years ago and buried beneath a thin sod of denials . But in his dreams the shadow corpses walked again , trailing behind them a residue of unease that clung to him throughout the day . Grimm was still struggling to answer when a guard burst through the doors to the study . " Milord . Milady . " The guard nodded deferentially to Hawk and Adrienne as he hastily entered the room . He approached Grimm , a somber expression on his face . " This just came for ye , Cap'n . " He thrust an official-looking piece of parchment into Grimm 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to be delivered into your hands only . " Grimm turned the message slowly in his hand . The elegant crest of Gibraltar St. Clair was pressed into the red wax . Suppressed memories broke over him : Jillian . She was a promise of beauty and joy he could never possess , a memory he 'd consigned to that same uncooperative , shallow grave that now seemed determined to regurgitate its dead . " Well , open it , Grimm , " Adrienne urged . Slowly , as if he held a wounded animal that might turn on him with sharp teeth , Grimm broke the seal and opened the missive . Stiffly , he read the terse , three-word command . His hand fisted reflexively , crumpling the thick vellum . Rising , he turned to the guard . " Prepare my horse . I leave in one hour . " The guard nodded and left the study . " Well ? " Hawk demanded . " What does it say ? " " Nothing you need to address , Hawk . Doona worry . It does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend concerns me , " Hawk said . " So give over , what 's wrong ? " " I said nothing . Leave it , man . " Grimm 's voice held a note of warning that would have restrained a lesser man 's hand . But the Hawk had never been , and would never be , a lesser man , and he moved so unexpectedly that Grimm did n't react quickly enough when he whisked the parchment from his hand . Grinning mischievously , Hawk backed away and uncrumpled the parchment . His grin broadened , and he winked at Adrienne . " ' Come for Jillian , ' it says . A woman , is it ? The plot thickens . I thought you 'd sworn off women , my fickle friend . So who 's Jillian ? " " A woman ? " Adrienne exclaimed delightedly . " A young , marriageable woman ? " " Stop it , you two . It 's not like that . " " Then why were you trying to keep it a secret , Grimm ? " Hawk pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and it would take far too long to explain . Lacking the leisure to tell you the full story , I 'll send you a message in a few months , " he evaded coolly . " You 're not getting out of this so easily , Grimm Roderick . " Hawk rubbed the shadow beard on his stubborn jaw thoughtfully . " Who is Jillian , and how do you know Gibraltar St. Clair ? I thought you came to court directly from England . I thought you knew no one in all of Scotland but for those you met at court . " " I did n't exactly tell you the whole story , Hawk , and I doona have time for it now , but I 'll tell you as soon as I get settled . " " You 'll tell me now , or I 'm coming with you , " Hawk threatened . " Which means Adrienne and Carthian are coming as well , so you can either tell me or prepare for company , and you never know what might happen if Adrienne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be a pain , Hawk . " " Relentless . Formidable , " Adrienne agreed sweetly . " You may as well give in , Grimm . My husband never takes no for an answer . Believe me , I know this . " " Come on , Grimm , if you ca n't trust me , who can you trust ? " he coaxed . " Where are you going ? " " It 's not a question of trust , Hawk . " Hawk merely waited with an expectant look on his face , and Grimm knew he had no intention of relenting . Hawk would push and poke and ultimately do exactly as he 'd threatened-come along-unless Grimm gave him a sufficient answer . Perhaps it was time he admitted the truth , although the odds were that once he did , he would n't be welcomed back at Dalkeith . " I 'm going home , sort of , " Grimm finally conceded . " Caithness is your home ? " " Tuluth , " Grimm muttered . " What ? " " Tuluth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You said you were born in Edinburgh ! " " I lied . " " Why ? You told me your entire family was dead ! Was that a lie too ? " " No ! They are . I did n't lie about that . Well ... mostly I did n't lie , " he corrected hastily . " My da is still alive , but I have n't spoken to him in more than fifteen years . " A muscle twitched in Hawk 's jaw . " Sit down , Grimm . You 're not going anywhere until you tell me all of it , and I suspect it 's a tale that 's long overdue . " " I doona have time , Hawk . If St. Clair said it was urgent , I was needed at Caithness weeks ago . " " What relevance has Caithness to any of this , or to you ? Sit . Talk . Now . " Sensing no possibility of reprieve , Grimm paced as he began his story . He told them how , at the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the massacre and wandered the forests of the Highlands for two years , wearing his war braids and hating mankind , hating his father , hating himself . He skipped the brutal parts-his mother 's murder , the starvation he 'd endured , the repeated attempts on his life . He told them that when he was sixteen he 'd found shelter with Gibraltar St. Clair ; that he 'd changed his name to Grimm to protect himself and those for whom he cared . He told them how the McKane had found him again at Caithness and attacked his foster family . And finally , in the tone of a dreaded confession , he told them what his real name had been . " What did you just say ? " Hawk asked blankly . Grimm drew a deep breath into his lungs and expelled it angrily . " I said Gavrael . My real name is Gavrael . " There was only one Gavrael in all of Scotland ; no other man would willingly own up to that name and that curse . He braced himself for the Hawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . " McIllioch ? " Hawk 's eyes narrowed disbelievingly . " McIllioch , " Grimm confirmed . " And Grimm ? " " Grimm stands for Gavrael Roderick Icarus McIllioch . " Grimm 's Highland brogue rolled so thickly around the name , it was a nearly unintelligible burr of r 's and l 's and staccato-sharp k 's . " Take the first letter of each name , and there you have it . G-R-I-M . " " Gavrael McIllioch was a Berserker ! " Hawk roared . " I told you you did n't know so much about me , " Grimm said darkly . Crossing the study in three swift strides , Hawk bristled to a stop inches from Grimm 's face and studied him , as if he might uncover some telltale trace of a beast that should have betrayed Grimm 's secret years ago . " How could I not have known ? " Hawk muttered . " For years I 'd been wondering about some of your peculiar ... talents . By the bloody saints , I should have guessed if only from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hawk , " Grimm said dryly . " Not like yours , Grimm , " Adrienne remarked . " This explains it all , " Hawk said slowly . " You 're not human . " Grimm flinched . Adrienne leveled a dark look at her husband and linked her arm through Grimm 's . " Of course he 's human , Hawk . He 's just human ... plus some . " " A Berserker . " Hawk shook his head . " A fardling Berserker . You know , they say William Wallace was a Berserker . " " And what a lovely life he had , eh ? " Grimm said bitterly . * * * Grimm rode out shortly thereafter , answering no more questions and leaving the Hawk immensely dissatisfied . He left quickly , because the memories were returning of their own accord and with fury . Grimm knew he had to be alone when full recollection finally reclaimed him . He did n't willingly think about Tuluth anymore . Hell , he did n't willingly think anymore , not if he could help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clouds of black so thick his eyes had stung from the acrid stench of burning homes and burning flesh . Children screaming . Och , Christ ! Grimm swallowed hard as he spurred Occam into a gallop across the ridge . He was impervious to the beauty of the Highland night , lost in another time , surrounded only by the color of blood and the blackness of soul-disfiguring desolation-with one shimmering spot of gold . Jillian . Is he an animal , Da ? May I keep him ? Please ? He 's an ever-so-glorious beastie ! And in his mind he was sixteen years old again , looking down at the wee golden lass . Memory swept over him , dripping shame thicker than clotted honey off a comb . She 'd found him in the woods , scavenging like a beast . He 'd be fiercer than my Savanna TeaGarden , Da ! Savanna TeaGarden being her puppy , all one hundred forty pounds of Irish wolfhound puppy . He 'd protect me well , Da , I know he would ! The instant she 'd said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do just that , never dreaming it might one day entail protecting her from himself . Grimm rubbed his clean-shaven jaw and tossed his head in the wind . For a brief moment he felt the matted hair again , the dirt and sweat and the war braids , the fierce eyes brimming with hatred . And the pure , sweet child had trusted him on sight . &lt; Continues ...
