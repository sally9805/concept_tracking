Derek and I came from separate worlds , and I was n't sure I had the courage to take on his sort of life . But even as I started to back away , I knew , in my heart , that it was already too late . <p> I always tell myself that the best season for coming home to Scotland is harvesttime , in August and September , when the shorn fields are golden and there is purple heather on the hills . But then , Christmastime is beautiful , too , with the lacebare trees and the ditches piled with snowdrifts . And in May , the wild white cherry trees flower , cloaking the glen road ; the breezes blow the blossoms like confetti all over the fields , and the grass is green and new . But now it was late April , after a long , cruel winter . There was still snow on the hills , not a daffodil had flowered , and the buds on the trees had scarcely taken form . But still , above the river where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with blackfaced ewes and their lambs , and their bleating was continuous . It was n't warm , but we had found a sheltered dell out of the wind , and the sun had come out for a moment . We should have been silent , drinking in all the peace and rugged beauty , but we were talking . We have always talked , because Jill was my best friend before she married my brother , Fergus , and the nice thing about this arrangement is that she has remained my friend , and I tell her things that I tell nobody else . Now , I was telling her about Derek . " In most ways it 's perfect , " I said . " I mean , we laugh at the same things , like the same food , and we do n't have to talk all the time . " " And you find him attractive , " said Jill . " Yes . " I pulled a blade of grass and chewed the stem . " Sometimes I wish he had frizzy red hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so attractive . " " So what 's the trouble ? " She was lying on her back , her arm over her eyes against the glare of the bright sunlight . Her body was thinner than ever after two children , her breasts as small as a young girl 's . But her face , released from the roundness of extreme youth , was somehow more beautiful . I sighed . " I do n't know . " " I think you do , " said Jill . " All right , I do . " I threw away the chewed stem of grass . " I 'm suffering from the most ghastly inverted snobbery . " There , it was out , and I felt better , but worse too . I turned on Jill in a fury at myself . " What 's wrong with me ? I 've never even thought about such things before . Being brought up here , it never mattered if a person was rich or poor , if they lived in a croft or a castle . There were always friends around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earl , and sometimes it was the shepherd 's wife from down the road , but they were treated the same . They were just people . I thought it would always be like that . I never imagined I 'd sprout a new set of values . " Jill said , " It 's working in London that does it . It 's the rat race of life . " " But it should n't be . " The sun went in . She sat up and yawned and wrapped her arms around her knees . She said , " How did you meet this paragon in the first place ? " " It was at an estate valuation . " " Explain , " said Jill . So I explained . FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS , I 'D WORKED AT BURLING AND FOWLES , an antique gallery on Bond Street , and for the last six months , I 'd been Mr. Lionel Burling 's personal assistant . So , one morning , when he announced that we were off to Gloucestershire to value an estate for probate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea that it was going to change my life . " It 's a house in Eveleigh , " Mr. Burling told me . He was bald , with a long sad face , and half-glasses that made him look like a gloomy Victorian . " It belonged to ... " he glanced at his papers , " a Mrs. Mannering . She died at ninety-two , and apparently her house is full of treasures . " " Who is going to live there now ? " I asked . Photograph <p> " I think it 's going to be sold . She had no children , so she 's left it to her nephew , Matthew Atkinson . It 's he who 's asked us to do the valuation . " Matthew Atkinson . I frowned . " Why do I know that name ? " " Well , he 's an important man in ... commodities , I believe . He and his family live not far from Eveleigh , in another beautiful Cotswold house . Haileway , it 's called . It 's open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The penny dropped . I 'd seen photographs of Haileway in glossy magazines and read articles about the capable and charming Mrs. Matthew Atkinson , who cooked , gardened , entertained , worked for charity , and still managed to look sensational . I remembered pictures of her in a straw hat , standing amid the glory of her rose garden . I wondered if we would meet her . I said , " When do we go ? " " Tomorrow , " said Mr. Burling WE DROVE TO GLOUCESTERSHIRE ON A bleak winter day . Mrs. Mannering 's house was on the main street of the little village . Mr. Burling rang the bell , and the great , carved oak door was opened by a tall young man wearing a checked muffler around his neck , an old green jacket , and a pair of corduroys on his long legs . He introduced himself as Derek Atkinson , Matthew 's son , and we all shook hands . Then Mr. Burling and I stepped inside . The hall was very dark , but a meager gleam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to illuminate the pale highlights in Derek Atkinson 's fair hair and the long line of his check and chin . I thought he was attractive . I took off my gloves and pulled my notebook from my bag . " Where would you like to start ? " Derek Atkinson asked Mr. Burling . " The dining room ? " He went to open a door , and , through it , we saw a long polished table , a candelabra , and portraits on the paneled walls . Mr. Burling gave one of his rare smiles . " The dining room , " he said , and we went through the open door . Usually I 'm detached about other people 's houses , and even more detached about their furniture . But I felt a little sad about Mrs. Mannering 's house . It was old , rambling , mellow , and shabby , yet it seemed to breathe with life . It had the strangest atmosphere-as if its owner had simply gone out for a walk and would soon he back . When we finished the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasures , we went to the local pub . Derek Atkinson insisted on paying for the drinks and brought them to the small corner table where we 'd settled . " You 're driving back to London this evening ? " he asked . " No , " said Mr. Burling , sipping his sherry , all he ever allowed himself . " I 'm going to visit my sister in Pershore . I do n't often get the chance to see her . " Derek glanced at me . " Are you going to Pershore as well ? " " No , I 'm going back to London . Mr. Burling 's going to drive me to Cheltenham , and I 'm catching the train . " Derek frowned . " But that 's miles out of your way , Mr. Burling . Why do n't you let me take your assistant back to Cheltenham ? I 'll put her on the train . " " Well ... " Mr. Burling was obviously happy to be persuaded , " if you 're sure ... " " I 'd drive her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's house this evening . " He looked at me and smiled , and I suddenly thought again how attractive he was , but , still , I had no premonition . I never thought about falling in love . Driving to Cheltenham , we talked . He asked me my name . I told him : Marigold Drummond . He asked where I was from . I said Scotland . He said that he had friends in Scotland . I asked him what he did . He said he worked in London with his father , but that he had his own flat , and was otherwise independent of his family . Then I asked him about his mother 's house . He told me , sounding both amused and proud , amused by the publicity given to his mother , and yet admiring of her achievements . " Of course , " he said , " she has a great deal of energy . It 's amazing what she can accomplish . She makes other people exhausted , just looking at her . " In a way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of her labors could never in a million years qualify as material for a glossy magazine . I never thought about falling in love , and , in retrospect , it 's difficult to say just when this extraordinary development happened . Not the first time he took me out , when we ate at a little Italian restaurant near where I live . We ambled home down the dark pavement , and I told him about my childhood home , and how my father had died two years earlier , and how Fergus had taken over the farm . " My mother still lives in the farmhouse . Fergus and his wife live in one of the cottages . He married my best friend , Jill , and they 've got two darling children . " " Do n't you miss it ? The country , I mean . " " Not as much as I would if I were stuck in London all the time . But I 'm lucky . Working for Mr. Burling , I get out and about . Like coming to Gloucestershire to value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Derek . His hands were deep in the pockets of his overcoat . " Yes . That was a good day . " I did n't fall in love the second time he took me out , when we spent a Saturday in the country , with a picnic hamper filled with delicious food , and it snowed , but even that did n't spoil the day . But perhaps it was the third time , when we went to the theater and had supper afterward , and he drove me home in his luxurious car , and I suddenly realized how rich he was , and what a catch for a poor hardworking girl like me . It was the word catch that caught me . It was a hateful word , scheming and materialistic . And I thought : This is n't what I want . When I married , I wanted it to be solid and familiar , like Fergus and Jill 's marriage . I did n't want a trip to the unknown , like some astronaut , plunging through darkness toward a distant , unexplored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened and started mentally backing away . But , just as suddenly , I knew , with a terrible sinking in my heart , that it was already too late . Over the next two weeks , I tried to analyze what I really felt , failing totally . My work suffered . I forgot messages , bungled calls . Eventually , Mr. Burling asked me what was the matter , and I burst into tears . He was very kind , producing a handkerchief and a cup of tea . I did n't tell him the whole truth . How could I ? Instead , I said that I was feeling run-down and sleeping badly . He said that I needed a little holiday . He suggested that I take three weeks and go home ; he would get a temporary secretary to fill my place . So , I did . And I did n't even call Derek and tell him that I was going . I did n't want him driving me to the station . I did n't want to say good-bye . WHEN I FINALLY CAME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , Jill was silent for a little . Then she said , " I still do n't see what you 're running from . " " From making a mistake , " I said . " I do n't want people saying , " She married him for his money . What a clever girl . What a catch she 's made . " And I do n't want to spend the rest of my life feeling out of my depth . We come from different worlds . I do n't think I 'm brave enough to take on his sort of life . His mother- " " But you have n't even met his mother ! " " I know . But the thought of her terrifies me . Imagine having a living legend for a mother-in-law . The very idea gives me the shivers . " " I think , " said Jill , " that you 're talking like a lunatic . " " I 'm not . I 'm facing facts . You do n't marry a man ; you marry his way of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I love him . " " Perhaps I love Derek , but I still wish he was n't who he is . " " If he were somebody else , " said Jill dryly , " this situation would never have arisen . " She looked at her watch . " I must go and feed the children . " Another woman on the farm had been watching over them while we sat by the river . She stood up . " Do you want to come ? " " No . " I stood up too . " You were sweet to listen . " We eyed each other . " What are you going to do when you go back to London ? " she asked . I shrugged . " I may not go back . " Alone , I walked back up the hill to the farmhouse , through the fields of sheep and across the pastIre that held my mother 's latest passion , her four Jacob sheep . " rhey were very tame , having been hand-fed since their arrival last year , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy with winter wool , horns butting my thighs in the hope of some small snack . " I'here were , as well , four tiny spotted lambs with horns just beginning to protrude from their w(x)lly brows . " IThey skipped , jumped , chased one another , and dashed for their mothers " teats . I stood for a little , watching them . " I'hen I walked on , through the gate and into the farmyard . Laundry flapped on the line by the back door . I unpegged it , put it into the basket , and lugged it indoors with me . My mother was in the kitchen , stirring a pot of soup on the stove . She wore rubber boots and a plastic apron over her trousers . Her hair was beginning to slip out of the casual bun she 'd pinned to the back of her head . She looked as she normally did . When I came through the door , she turned to smile , and all the lines on her suntanned face went tIp at the corners , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of day . She said , " Oil , you dear girl , you 've brought in those sheets . I was meaning to do it , but I forgot . " I dumped the basket in a corner of the littered kitchen . I saw the old dog in his basket , the sewing machine , set up and forgotten , where , two days ago , my mother had been patching pilIc-ases . I saw the geraniums on the windowsill , the cat sleeping on the rack above the stove . I thought of Derek 's mother as she seemed in pictures-ordered , elegant , and beautiful . I thought of Derek with his expensive car and his modern London apartment . And it was like thinking about someone from another world , a world so diametrically opposed to mine , I knew the two could never join , could never even touch . TWO WEEKS LATER , I WAS STILL AT home , still undecided about whether I would go back to London . I had actually drafted a letter of resignation to NIr . Burling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to post it . The alternatives were vague . If I did n't return to London , I could n't stay at home , doing nothing , earning nothing . I 'd have to get another job . Perhaps in Aberdeen or Edinburgh . Every now and then , I perused the local want ads , but my heart was n't in it , and I managed never to find anything remotely attractive . Then came the phone call . If I 'd answered it myself , everything would have been different . But I was out , helping Fergus move some cattle , and by the time I came home for our midday meal , it was too late . " I 've a surprise for you , " said my mother as I came through the back door . " A phone call from Derek Atkinson . " Derek . I stopped dead . I met her eyes across the room . " He sounded so nice . And very surprised that I 'd never heard of him . Why did n't you tell me about him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , anyway , he 's over at Relkirk , with his mother , spending the weekend with friends . " Relkirk was only 20 miles away . You traitor , I thought . You were n't supposed to follow me . I 'm running away from you . " So , of course , I asked them over . They 're coming for tea today . I 've just put a batch of scones in the oven . " " They 're coming for tea ? " I repeated . " Oh , Marigold , surely you would n't have wanted me not to ask them . " " No , no , of course not . " I imagined Mrs. Atkinson picking her way through the farmyard in her highheeled Italian leather shoes . I saw my mother 's house through her cool , appraising eye : the smelly old dog asleep by the fire , the hens clucking at the back door . This morning , in a rush of enthusiasm , my mother had washed the dog 's blankets , and they hung , ragged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atkinson would n't think they were our blankets . I began to laugh . It was either that or cry . " What 's so funny ? " asked my mother . " Oh , nothing . It 's just that ... well , I hope you 'll get on with her . " " Do you get on with her ? " " I 've never met her . " " Then why do you think I wo n't get on with her ? " She sounded both puzzled and a little hurt . I sat down at the table and tried to explain . " She 's rich and rare . " My mother frowned . " You mean , we should lay tea in the parlor ? " I began to laugh again . " No , " I said . " We 'll have it here , just the way we always do . They can take us as they find us . " My mother is no fool . Her blue eyes became thoughtful . After a little , she said , " Do you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ? " " I feel in love with him , if that 's what you mean . " It was a relief to say it out loud , at last . " But I do n't think it 's a good thing to be . " " Is that why you came back from London ? " " Yes. , " Does he feel the same about you ? " " I honestly do n't know . " She thought about this , then said , " I see . " I went on sitting there , silent and gloomy . All at once , my mother smiled . " What you need , " she told me , " is something to eat . " And she opened the oven and took out a steak-and-kidney pie , and the kitchen was instantly flooded with warmth and comfort . I said , " You know , if I 'd looked for a million years , I could n't have found a mother I like better than you . " She slit the crust of the pie with her favorite knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , " she said . IT WAS RAINING WHEN THEY CAME , A spring downpour , flooding the yard and cloaking the hills in a thick cloud . I was in my bedroom , which overlooks the yard , brushing my hair and wondering if I should put on a skirt in honor of the occasion , when I heard the car coming up the drive . Cautiously , like some old village gossip , I peered down from behind the curtain . I saw a big green Range Rover draw up , then a door open . Derek got out , hunched against the rain , and came around the car to help his mother . I had a glimpse of a blowing raincoat and a head covered in a silk scarf . At that moment , the door opened below me and I heard my mother 's voice . " What a day ! Come along in , quickly , out of the rain . " I drew back . I met my own eyes in the mirror , gathered my courage , and went downstairs . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deference to the expected company , but even so it was still full of clutter . One end of the table had been laid with a fresh cloth and the best china . Two wheelhack chairs had been drawn up to the warmth of the stove . There was a delicious smell of hot scones , and my mother 's famous sponge cake was already set out on a fluted plate , ( o ) zing jam and cream and lightly dusted with powdered sugar . Mrs. Atkinson had shed her coat and untied her scarf , and was now shaking out her short hair , which was a subtle mixture of gold and silver . She was tall and wore a tweed suit , with a pink sweater and a long gold chain . " April 's living up to its reputation , " my mother was saying , " bright one moment and streaming the next . " I stepped fully into the room , and Mrs. Atkinson turned and saw me . " This is Marigold , " said my mother . " I do n't believe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my hand in both of her own . Her eyes were the same color as her son 's , and just as smiling ; her nose was small , arched , and very aristocratic . She was immensely pretty . She said , " I 've been so looking forward to meeting you , and here we are at last . Fancy having to come such a long way . And what a lovely place to live . " " I 'm glad you found us all right . Mother 's directions are n't always very clear . " She let go of my hand , and I looked past her and said , " Hello , Derek . " " Hello . " He came over and kissed my check . " How are you ? " " She 's hardworked , " said my mother before I had time to reply . " I never let her stop for a moment . " She lifted the kettle off the stove . " We 're over the lambing , but this is a dreadfully busy time of year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done . " Mrs. Atkinson settled herself , with no fuss , in one of the chairs . " You 've got Jacobs , " she said to my mother . " I saw them when we came up the road . I 've been wanting Jacob sheep for ages . I thought they could eat down the grass in the orchard at Haileway , but my husband thinks it 's a rotten idea . I think he has visions of having to feed them on the weekends . " " Oh , but you wo n't need to feed them , " said my mother . " Not if you 've got good grass . You 'd need to wire off your fruit trees , though , otherwise they 'll eat the bark and kill the trees . And you 'll need high fences , because they 're great jumpers . " " Perhaps , after tea , we could go and look at them . " Derek said mildly , " Mama , you 'll get your feet soaked . " " Not at all . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , of course , " I said faintly , because it was taking some time to get over the shock of realizing that she was not in the least the way I had imagined her . Throughout tea , the mothers talked nonstop , while Derek and I sat on opposite sides of the table . I le ate five scones . I did n't eat anything . I had to keep telling myself that he was here . Those were his hands , his tweed jacket with the patches at the elbows , his long , bony face , his smiling eyes , his pale hair . I had expected tensions , long , awkward silences . Instead , it was as though we had known our visitors all our lives . My mother was onto roses now . " Yes , I can grow them , but , of course , we get the most terrible frosts , and if they 're too exposed , they do n't survive the winter . But last autumn , I planted a Fruhlingsgold . I wonder if you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creamy vellow flowers and a delicious smell . I 'll show it to you when we go to see the sheep . Now , have some more tea . And another slice of sponge cake ... " It was still raining after tea , but Mrs. Atkinson refused to be deterred . She plunged her slender legs into an old pair of boots , buttoned herself into her raincoat , and announced that she was ready . My mother put on her black oilskin with the patch on the shoulder and an old tweed hat , and the two of them set off , splashing across the yard , still talking . I closed the door behind them . The house , all at once , was very duiet . I could hear the ticking of the kitchen clock . Derek and I looked at each other . " Hello , " he said , " You already said that . " " That was a social hello . This is just for you . Why did n't you let me know you were leaving ls ) ndon ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why did you want to leave in the first place ? " I did n't reply . He went on , " I called Mr. Burling and he said you 'd gone home for a holiday . He said he thought you were a little under the weather . But I did wonder ... if it had anything to do with me . With you and me , I mean . With us . " To give myself something to do , I began stacking plates and cups . I said , for he was being honest and the least I could do was to try to match his directness , " Yes , I suppose it did . " " You mean , you did n't want to see me anymore ? " " Yes . Because I felt we were too different , our backgrounds and circumstances . You 're rich , and my family has never had two brass farthings to rub together . I could n't bear for people to think that I loved you for materialistic reasons . I could n't bear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as you could give me . I did n't want to be overwhelmed . There . Are those enough reasons ? " I expected him to turn on me , to become impatient as Jill had , but he did n't . He thought a little while , then said , " Yes , those are reasons . But they 're all wrong . Agreed , our backgrounds are superficially different , but basically they 're the same : solid homes , a mother and father , brothers and sisters . We all work for our livings , albeit in different ways . Our mothers grow roses and are mad about sheep . You 've got an old dog in a basket by the fire . Well , we 've got an old dog , too , but he always sleeps in the best armchair . When I finally get you to Hailcway , you 'll meet him for yourself , and he 'll probably bite you . " He grinned . " He always bites strangers , but it does n't do any damage , because he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And then he was n't smiling any longer ; his face was , all at once , filled with pain . He held out his arms to me and said , " Oh , Marigold , stop fiddling with those plates and come and tell me that you ca n't live without me , because I know for certain that existence without you is quite unthinkable- " He never finished his sentence , because , by then , I had burst into tears , crossed the room , and flung myself into his arms , and the rest of his words were lost in an incoherent babble of apology and reconciliation . " I 'm sorry , Derek . I just felt I was out of my depth , as though I was drowning . I did n't mean to hurt you , but I was afraid . " He kissed my streaming eyes . He was smiling again . He said , " You do n't need to bc afraid ever again . " WHEN THE MOTHERS RETURNED , WE 'D finished washing the dishes and were sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait to tell us that Mrs. Atkinson was going to buy two of my mother 's Jacob lambs as a surprise present for Mr. Atkinson . " That 'll take the wind out of his sails , " Mrs. Atkinson told us , with an endearing giggle . And Derek would have to arrange for them to be transported to Gloucestershire by carrier just as soon as they were old enough to travel , and she would get someone to put wire netting around the trees in the orchard , and perhaps She stopped abruptly , not because she 'd run out of things to tell us , but because our silence had at last gotten through to her . She looked at us , then at my mother , then back again . She said , " You 're very quiet . " " When you 've finished talking , " said Derek politely , " Marigold and I have something to tell you .
