With the richness of brocade and the smoothness of shot silk , Schama 's prose unfurls the life of Rembrandt in all its pathos . From prodigy to pauper , the troubled genius of 17th century Dutch painting is intricately conceived as he rises and falls in a world of war , plague and stolid bourgeois comfort . A galvanic force  --  ambitious , hugely inventive , avaricious  --  he is the portraitist of the poshest plutocrats , nobly aglitter , and the allegorist of human wreckage . Schama 's book is a marvel of storytelling : sometimes heart pounding , always sympathetic and coolly reasoned . Seamlessly joining social history and art , what a triumph of scholarship and imagination ! <P>  --  By Steven Henry Madoff
