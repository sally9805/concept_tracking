Creator David E. Kelley ( Ally McBeal ) is no stranger to provocative , zeitgeisty premises , and in theory this slick private-eye series is a Lewinsky-era doozy : privacy-invading , sexy investigations by sexy investigators using high-tech , extra-constitutional means . But he 's done little more with it yet than find excuses to get his babe-licious P.I.s into halter tops and hooker outfits , a setup spiced up with Moonlighting-style banter between Gina Gershon and Paula Marshall .
