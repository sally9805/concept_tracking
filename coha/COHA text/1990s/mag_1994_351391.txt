She was at her best in the crunch . When disaster struck in Dallas on Nov. 22 , 1963 , those who saw her said she was tearless , perhaps spacy , " with a 50-yard stare . " But she knew what she had to do to fulfill her commitment to her husband , her children and her country . Her bright pink suit was soiled with blood and gray matter , but she would not change it or leave John F. Kennedy 's body . <P> Everyone present tried to get her away from a gory scene , but there was nothing spacy , nothing at a 50-yard remove , about her defiant resolve . When one of several doctors at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas urged her to leave , she said , " Do you think seeing the coffin can upset me , doctor ? I 've seen my husband die , shot in my arms . His blood is all over me . How can I see anything worse than I 've seen ? " <P> Often described as a mannequin , remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality of death by gunshot . At Parkland , where the President was taken by ambulance , every time the Secret Service urged her out , she walked right back in , circling the trauma room . Dr. Marion Jenkins , now 76 , remembers that in the minutes after the shooting , " I noticed that she was carrying one hand cupped over the other hand . She nudged me with her left elbow and then with her right hand handed me a good-sized chunk of the President 's brain . She did n't say a word . I handed it to the nurse . Then they led her out of the room again . " <P> After Kennedy was officially declared dead , the various tubes and his back corset  --  all were removed . His wife approached the body , and , as Jenkins recalls , " she started kissing him . She kissed his foot , his leg , thigh , chest , and then his lips . She did n't say a word .

Then , turning to her husband 's close aide , P. Kenneth O'Donnell , she asked , " The ring . Did I do the right thing ? " O'Donnell told her to leave the symbol where it lay . <P> In the public eye , Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis ' heroism is imprinted through indelible images : at L.B.J. 's side , with a gaze more eloquent than any words , as he took the oath of office ; gripping Robert Kennedy 's hand and then her children 's ; receiving the flag that had covered J.F.K. 's coffin . But what of the woman beyond the camera 's range ? There are no pictures of her heartbreak and bravery at Parkland . Yet that was somehow her way . <P> Last week she died as she had lived , the most private of public persons , a delicate glow in the harshly lit landscape of American celebrity . Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis radiated courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about her crowded life no one knows because , with the exception of interviews granted to Theodore White and William Manchester in 1963 and 1964 respectively , she never spoke about her experiences after the assassination or revealed her reactions or opinions . Tapes of these interviews exist ; White 's will be released next year , but Manchester 's are embargoed until 2064.
