txt // changing ideas of space and matter in physics represent a profound evolution of metaphors . THE LITERAL AND THE METAPHORICAL The idea of metaphor , as used in this and earlier chapters , may seem out of place in a book on physics . In its simplest sense , metaphor refers to a figurative comparison that evokes an ironic , humorous , symbolic , or poetic similarity between two different and unlike things . " Life is a dream " and " crocodile tears " are examples . As poets and artists know only too well , metaphor is the very stuff of creativity . We can hardly think without analogies , comparisons , and metaphors , and metaphors are far more common in science than we realize . Notions of the universe or the human body as a machine and of the mind as a computer have become part of the vernacular . But even such basic physical concepts as space , time , matter , and number have an essential metaphorical character . ' ' To speak of the curvature of space as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest that this comparison represents a precise mathematical equivalence . Curved space and gravity are one and the same in the equations of relativity . Metaphor is a linguistic concept that has no place in mathematics . But if space and gravity are one and the same , then why must we equate them ? Equality implies an equivalence between two different things ; a relationship between two different things is exactly what a metaphor is . Mathematical equations effectively function as metaphors . If we try to sever semantics from mathematics , then we can never interpret an equation or a mathematical theory . Language is as essential to the practice and progress of physics as is mathematics . A sharp distinction between the literal and metaphorical , even in science , is impossible to draw . One scientist 's // meat is another 's poison . Even if we could divest mathematical equations of all metaphorical content , it would still be impossible to discuss , report on , and ? most important ? create science without the use of metaphors . All creative work employs metaphor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought has largely been denied and rejected in the modern scientific age.2 But the curved space-time of relativity and the complementarity of quantum theory have returned metaphor to a central role in the poetry of twentieth-century science . MATTER AS STUFF The idea of tiny impenetrable entities , or particles , as the fundamental constituents of matter dates back to the ancient Greeks in the time of Democritus . Our very word atom comes from a Greek term meaning undivided . At the dawn of the modern scientific era , it was Descartes who made the strongest claim for the motion of particles as the fundamental basis of all phenomena . Although Newton rejected many of the details of Descartes ' work , he retained its basic spirit of a mechanics of particles . By the end of the nineteenth century , all material phenomena were assumed to result from the motion of particles and of electromagnetic waves in space . Although atoms , electrons , and later neutrons and protons were taken to be fundamental at one time or another , the history of twentieth-century physics has been the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ever smaller particles as the elementary constituents of matter . The " indivisible " atom was , split long ago into its electrons and nucleus . The electron has miraculously survived unscathed from the penetrating rays of ever more powerful atom smashers . It remains indivisible and elemental in most current theories of physics . The // nucleus has not been so fortunate . It was broken apart into neutrons , protons , and other exotic members of the socalled hadron family . Neutrons and protons are not themselves fundamental particles . They , in turn , are made of much smaller particles called quarks ? the latest and somewhat elusive candidates for the most elementary subnuclear particles . ' Despite all this dividing and conquering , we have n't yet the slightest idea what elementary particles are made of . Electrons and quarks are the smallest and most fundamental objects we can detect ( quarks only indirectly ) . Quarks are a thousand times smaller than the neutrons and protons they inhabit and one hundred million times smaller than the once indivisible atom . What this means is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particle accelerators , electrons and quarks remain indivisible and without any internal structure . If electrons and quarks are made out of anything else , it 's still too small for us to " see . " Down to the smallest scale of current-day measurement , electrons and quarks are point particles ? that is , they have no size . Now the idea of a point particle ? a tiny bit of matter that has no size or extension in space ? has long been a useful idealization in physics , a metaphor . As a physical reality , it 's an impossibility . How can matter occupy no space at all ? To be truly an impenetrable point object , matter would have to have an infinite density ? a physical impossibility . And if some tiny bit of matter could occupy no space , then why could n't a larger chunk of matter ? or the whole universe , for that matter ? do the same ? Why would matter take up any space at all ? Sooner or later , quarks and electrons will have to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an explanation of the nature of things in terms of a physical impossibility . As a metaphorical ideal , the point particle has been a great boon to physics ; as literal reality , it is a profound embarrassment . Even if we can get around the size problem , what is the stuff that elementary particles ( whatever they may be ) are made of ? Is there anything of substance down there ? As we have seen , the quantum-theory description of an electron is in terms of a wave function , which is neither material nor even physical . Quantum theory gives us some information ( which is only statistical , remember ) about the location of an electron , but it tells us nothing about what it is we find ( if we 're lucky enough ) and what the damn thing is made of . On these subjects quantum theory is mute . Its only concession is the laconic and maddening comment that we have no need of such information . Well , if wave functions are n't matter , they are at least mathematics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does that mean ? And is mathematics preferable to metaphor as the flesh and blood of the universe ? Mathematics , like metaphor , is an artifice of the human mind . We marvel and rejoice over the mathematical structure of the universe . Everything from the cosmos to the quark seems to manifest a mathematical structure or pattern . But if the universe is " made of " mathematics , then what other structure could it have ? And if it is made of mathematics , is t he universe then a product of the human mind ? And is the universe a metaphor for . . . what ? Perhaps we go too far . ( Or is it physics that goes too far ? ) i Hs Too Too SOLID FLESH If we ca n't figure out what the stuff is that matter is made of can we at least get some insight into its solidity and Impenetrability ? The old adage says you ca n't put two things in t be same place at the same time . The quantum174 PHYSICS FOR THE REST OF US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Pauli exclusion principle , which says that two electrons can not both occupy the same quantum state in an atom . So both the solidity and incompressibility of matter and the periodic structure of the chemical elements depend on the idea that atoms or molecules or electrons are impenetrable . But if matter or electrons are n't made of some substance or stuff , then what is it that can not be penetrated ? We need to be careful . The impenetrability of matter is n't just a matter of stuff . It 's also related to rigidity ? to what keeps matter from collapsing and makes it occupy a certain amount of space . There are forces between atoms that hold them in place and keep them from getting too close . These attractive and repulsive forces , as they 're called , are electromagnetic in nature . Their combined action in condensed matter keeps atoms at a certain average distance from one another.4 Thus the shape , rigidity , and extension of objects is explained in terms of interatomic and intermolecular forces . There is a logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relativity , we noted that the force of gravity is never directly observed . We infer its existence from the motion of planets , projectiles , and falling rocks . The hypothesis of a universal force of gravity enables us to explain many different phenomena under one rubric ? from the behavior of galaxies to Archimedes ' principle for floating bodies . We never actually see the force of gravity ? it is known " only by its fruits . " This fact , together with the impossibility of distinguishing gravity from acceleration , was Einstein 's key to the general theory of relativity , which dispensed with the force of gravity altogether . Now matters are essentially no different for the electromagnetic force ( not to mention the other basic forces of nature that operate only inside the nucleus of the atom ) . Forces are observed and measured in terms of their effects . // When we see a compass needle being deflected , we attribute the needle 's rotation to the magnetic force of attraction of the earth . We never see or directly observe this magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character and structure of the earth 's magnetic field is inferential . Similarly , we attribute the rigidity , solidity , and impenetrability of matter to electromagnetic forces , which , of course , are never directly observed . In science , this is not a problem , because the assumed existence of electromagnetic forces explains so many different phenomena that we hardly think of it as an assumption . The theory of electromagnetic forces hangs together as a self-sustaining system of great generality and utility . THE LOGIC OF THE MATTER From the logical point of view , however , there is a problem . To claim that electromagnetic forces explain the rigidity of matter and yet to infer the existence of these forces from the rigidity of matter is a logical fallacy ? a circular argument . Science often gets away with such circular argument . We can infer electromagnetic forces from the observation of colliding electrons , say , and then use the same forces to " explain " solidity . But there is a big stretch here ? using one phenomenon to explain another ? especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction far more complex than the simple repulsion of two electrons . Furthermore , the forces assumed to explain the rigidity of matter are always associated with matter itself , whose form and substance , as we 've already seen , are complete mysteries . Forces and matter go together in physics . We never have one without the other . To explain the rigidity of matter in terms of its internal forces is like saying that matter is solid because it is solid . The forces are not directly observable and can never be dissociated from matter itself . Forces are intrinsic properties of matter . Their existence // and character is no more or less of a puzzle than that of matter itself . The impermanence of forces is clearest in the theory of relativity . There , geometry replaced gravity . All the inferences from planets and falling bodies could not save the force of gravity , once Einstein had made a better and more encompassing theory ( also , of course , an assumption ) . Had Einstein succeeded in the great quest of his final years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we would no longer talk of an electromagnetic force . But , of course , he failed . Quantum theory made its reputation on the basis of its treatment of electromagnetism . Quantum electrodynamics is touted as the most accurate theory in history . And so for the moment , the electromagnetic force is secure ( if illogical ) . In the final analysis , even if forces could be placed on a firm logical , as well as empirical , basis , they could not save the day . For interatomic and intermolecular forces clearly do not explain electrons and quarks . If these elementary particles are not points ( which is a physical impossibility ) , then what holds them together or keeps them from collapsing , as the case may be ? Why does n't the electrical charge of an electron repel itself and fly apart ? If we assume another force to hold it together , then we 're back to the same circular argument.5 Forces are no better at explaining solidity and extension than the abstract descriptions of matter itself . The whole problem was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The matter that we construct is impenetrable as a result of definition : the matter in a place is all the events that are there , and consequently no other // event or piece of matter can be there . This is a tautology , not a physical fact ; one might as well argue that London is impenetrable because nobody can live in it except one of its inhabitants.6 THE HEART OF THE MATTER Physics presents us with a bewildering array of theories , models , and metaphors for matter : Newtonian matter in space , Einsteinian matter as space , gravity as acceleration , gravity as geometry , particles as waves , waves as particles , wave functions , probability distributions ? and there are other examples that we 'll encounter in later chapters . The changing view of matter , first as substance , then as space , and finally as mathematical abstraction or information , demonstrates a profound evolution of metaphors . Our concept of matter becomes more and more ethereal . The objects of the everyday world are evaporating before our very eyes ( our mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguish in physics any longer between space and matter . This strange dematerialization of matter into space , geometry , and information is not unique to science . In Platonic philosophy , the cosmos itself was an organic whole ? a living being . Its space was like a cosmic realm of intelligence , consciousness , and wisdom . There was no sharp distinction between the cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies and the thinking processes of the mind . Motion in space , changes in time , and thinking in the mind were related and intertwined in ways we can no longer comprehend . ' All of this represents a metaphorical state of mind that was still present in medieval astrology but which we no longer experience as a culture . We think of such a consciousness as primitive , superstitious , anthropomorphic . But are n't we begging the question ? In Hinduism , there is also the concept of the akasha , // which is ether or space and yet is a kind of vast warehouse or library of all past , present , and future events . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force itself and , most significantly , the medium of hearing and of revealed knowledge . ' Here is a remarkable blend of space , matter , and consciousness , which despite its ancient primitive origins seems to hint at both the mathematical informational representation of matter in quantum theory and the spatialization of matter in relativity . Hindu philosophy sees the material world as illusion ? and how far is illusion from abstraction and mathematics ? What , after all , are our twentieth-century castles in the air ? Mind , mathematics , metaphor ... ? // Interpretations of Quantum Theory FROM THE OUTSET , THE UNIQUE and revolutionary character of quantum theory provoked a vigorous debate over its validity and interpretation , which has continued throughout the twentieth century . Are the laws of nature ultimately probabilistic ? Is there any reality there between our observations ? Do we actually affect phenomena by observing them ? Einstein was foremost in leading a crusade on several fronts to discredit quantum theory . For one thing , he refused to accept laws of nature that were no different from gambling odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the world . " In a celebrated series of debates with Bohr , Einstein raised another group of criticisms in which he attempted to expose potential loopholes , fallacies , and deficiencies in quantum theory . Bohr ingeniously managed to rebuff all of Einstein 's attacks . But in a 1935 paper , Einstein marshalled a new argument that claimed that quantum theory fails to provide a complete description of nature . According to Einstein , certain physical effects can be observed that quantum theory fails to predict . This challenge ultimately led to a remarkable 1 in // series of experiments by Alain Aspect that were designed to settle the dispute . Aspect 's experiments thoroughly vindicated quantum theory . The theory does in fact predict , but can not explain , some very weird phenomena , which Einstein had assumed were impossible . It seems that information can travel faster than the speed of light ? apparently in direct violation of relativity and the laws of causality . The implications of Aspect 's experiments remain controversial , but they have prompted even more outlandish interpretations of quantum theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had he lived to hear about them . COPENHAGEN REVISITED The Copenhagen view of quantum theory , developed primarily by Bohr and Heisenberg , has generally come to prevail among the majority of physicists , despite continuing controversy . According to this view , the laws of nature are neither objective nor deterministic . They do not describe a reality that is independent of the observer . You can not help but affect the outcome of any observation you make , as the uncertainty principle tells us . The experimental predictions that the laws do make are always statistical rather than deterministic . No trajectories , only probability distributions . The seeming contradiction between electron waves in one experiment and particles in another is an example of the complementarity principle . Quantum theory predicts wave or particle behavior correctly and consistently , but never simultaneously . According to Bohr , the contradictions arise only in our minds when we try to infer an ongoing " behind-the-scenes " picture of an electron , which is no part of the theory . Furthermore , there is nothing else to be learned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory provides . The theory is complete : anything it does not tell us may be interesting conjecture or metaphysics , but it is neither observable nor measurable , and therefore is irrelevant to science . // Nothing about the Copenhagen interpretation satisfied Einstein 's requirements for what a properly objective and deterministic theory of physics ought to be like . Over the years , he challenged and debated Bohr through a series of thought experiments designed to demonstrate some inconsistency or error in the predictions of quantum theory . Einstein would present Bohr with some dilemma or contradiction in quantum theory . Bohr would sleep on it and return the next day with a resolution . Invariably , Einstein had overlooked something or neglected some effect . In one case , ironically , Einstein forgot to take into account his own general theory of relativity . ' Ultimately , Einstein accepted the internal consistency of quantum theory , but he clung tenaciously to one crucial criticism . It was Bohr 's claim that the theory is complete that seemed most vulnerable to Einstein . He could not accept the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality , whether we observe them or not . If quantum theory can not describe continuous elements of physical reality , then clearly the theory must be incomplete . In 1935 , Einstein and two colleagues wrote a paper that challenged the completeness of quantum theory . // The paper by Einstein , Podolsky , and Rosen has become so well known among physicists and philosophers of science that it is usually referred to simply as EPR . The idea of the EPR paper is to offer a thought experiment that could be done in principle but whose outcome can not be predicted by quantum theory . If there is an experimental measurement that can be made but that quantum theory fails to // predict , then the theory is incomplete . A complete theory must be able to predict the result of any actual experiment . I shall present a simplified version of the original argument , which is nevertheless faithful to the spirit of EPR . We imagine two electrons colliding like billiard balls . Now as we know , electrons are not literally particles , but they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually touch and bounce like balls with hard surfaces , but because electrons carry negative electrical charge , they repel each other . Two electrons that approach each other head on will repel and thus slow each other down more and more as they get closer . Finally , the electrons will reverse their motion and fly off from each other in opposite directions . Even though they never touch , they act as if they had bounced apart . In both classical physics and quantum theory , a collision like this between two bodies is governed by the law of conservation of momentum . Applied to this case , a conservation law states that some physical quantity , like momentum or energy , is conserved or unchanged in the course of the collision . The direction and the speed of each electron may change , but the total momentum of the two electrons will remain constant . The total momentum is simply the sum of the momenta of the two electrons . The momentum of each electron is a certain measure of its motion , ' so as the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentum governs their interaction . Their total momentum before and after the collision must be the same . Particles that interact in this way according to the law of conservation of momentum are said to be correlated . The momentum of one electron correlates with the momentum of the other . If , before the collision , one electron has 2 units of momentum and the other has 5 units of momentum , then their total momentum before the collision is 7 units . By conservation of momentum , the total // momentum after the collision must also be 7 units . If , after the collision , the first electron now has 3 units of momentum , then the other must have 4 units . By knowing the correlated total momentum before and the momentum of one electron after , we can find the momentum of the second electron after the collision . This very powerful technique can be used to solve such problems as firing a ballistic missile and tracing the temperature of a gas to the interaction of its molecules . We shall use it now to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought experiment are correlated by conservation of momentum . After the two electrons interact , they fly apart , but their total momentum remains what it was before the interaction . It turns out that the relative position of the two particles is also correlated . Thus , if I measure the position of electron one , I can infer the position of electron two . The two electrons are correlated by both their momenta and their positions . Suppose after the interaction I measure the position of electron one and shortly afterwards the momentum of electron one . I can perform these measurements with arbitrarily high accuracy because I 'm measuring only the position in the first case and only the motion in the second case . ( Recall that the uncertainty principle prohibits us from simultaneously measuring the position and motion ? momentum , to be precise ? of one particle with arbitrarily high accuracy . ) In our thought experiment , let 's assume the measurements are exact . Now , here 's the rub . The measurement of the exact position and momentum of electron one ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and momentum of electron two . ( The method is similar to the calculation of correlated momenta that we did above . ) But I have never disturbed electron two , and therefore I could not have affected its position or momentum in any way . Its momentum ( or simply , its speed ) remains constant as its position varies uniformly . So the position and momentum I have determined for electron two must be its exact position and // momentum at one particular time after the collision . Therefore , I now know the simultaneous position and momentum of electron two . This contradicts the uncertainty principle . In other words , I have made a measurement ? of the position and momentum of an electron ? that quantum theory says is impossible and about which it makes no prediction . Therefore , quantum theory is incomplete . This is the EPR argument in a nutshell . EINSTEIN CONTRA BOHR At first hearing , the EPR argument sounds devastating . Not only is quantum theory incomplete but it 's the uncertainty principle ? the very cornerstone of the quantum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible to measure simultaneously the position and momentum of a particle ( except perhaps in Copenhagen ) . But EPR never fazed Bohr , for the deeper implications of EPR are completely consistent with Bohr 's point of view . Bohr says to Einstein : " So , Albert , you claim you can measure the exact position and momentum of an electron . Let 's see if you are right . Let 's try to measure directly both the position and momentum of electron one in your thought experiment . If we do this , the uncertainty principle will surely kick in and prevent us from making the exact measurements you claim . Do n't you agree ? " Einstein responds with a twinkle in his eye . " Of course I agree , Niels , if I measure the position and momentum of electron two directly . But I can measure the momentum of electron two indirectly by using the correlation of the two momenta . " " But , my dear Albert , have you indeed measured the momentum of electron two indirectly ? Once you measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning , according to quantum theory . You have determined a number , I grant you , but is it really the momentum of two ? The // only way to check it is by a direct measurement , which you have already admitted you can not do . " " Surely , Niels , you can not discount my indirect measurement . I have made two physical measurements of electron one and then used correlations to determine the position and momentum of electron two . This is a perfectly valid procedure , used all the time by experimental physicists . Clearly electron two has a position and momentum , whether I observe it directly or not . " " That is precisely where we differ , Albert . Quantum theory tells us nothing about continuously existing elements of physical reality . It tells us only the results of specific measurements . And you can not measure the exact position and momentum of electron two , or of any other electron , for that matter . The unobserved measurement ' of an electron is a figment of your imagination . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my measurement of electron one implies nothing physical about electron two ? Or , worse yet , are you implying that by observing one , I am affecting two ? Does my measurement of one somehow change the momentum of two and make it uncertain ? This would be an impossibility ? a violation of causality , an instantaneous transfer of information , a case of . . . of . . . of . . . of spooky actions at a distance . It 's completely preposterous ! " " Now , now , Albert , please calm down . We see these matters very differently . You speak of violations of causality , of ? what was it ? ' spooky actions at a distance . ' All of this assumes there is an objective world there ? two electrons interacting according to conservation laws , even when we 're not observing them . " " But , but ... " " Yes , yes , Albert , I know you disagree , but let me go on . Quantum theory tells us nothing of such an objective independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can not break the system down into electron one , electron two , and the instruments of our observation . In // quantum theory these form an inseparable whole . The instruments and how we use them are a part of the system . We have no right to speak of what electron one or two may be doing if we are not directly observing them . And when we make an observation , the experimental apparatus is automatically included as part of the system . We can not separate the parts and say how one part is affecting another . All we can do is make a measurement at any given time and ask quantum theory for the result of that measurement , which it unfailingly gives us . But it gives us the result for the totality of the electrons and the experiment ? a totality that is whole and indivisible . When you measure the position and then the momentum of electron one , that is all you know . Measuring the position and momentum of electron two is a different experiment with a different outcome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first experiment , I do not know the physical state of electron two , period . I can not speak of one part affecting another , nor can I try to correlate the results of the two different experiments . There is no violation of causality because no deterministic causal laws operate within the system . Quantum theory does not describe continuous causal behavior of electrons in space-time . " Einstein , now subdued , sits for a moment nodding his head and then responds : " What you are saying , Niels , is that we have here a deep incompatibility ? and it 's not only between the two of us . If quantum theory is complete , then there can be no objective causal reality . According to you , my argument demonstrates not the incompleteness of quantum theory but rather its strange complementary character . My picture of the correlated electrons interacting causally in spacetime directly contradicts the assumption that quantum theory is complete . Objective causal reality and quantum completeness are incompatible , or , as you would say , complementary . " " Precisely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantum theory do not // apply to an objective independent reality . Your EPR argument simply affirms all of this . It demonstrates the validity of the Copenhagen interpretation . " " But are you satisfied with such a state of affairs ? No physically real electrons ? No causal space-time behavior ? No longer a theory of nature , but merely of information ? " " What can I say , Albert ? I did not make the laws . Quantum theory answers any experimental question we can ask . It has correctly predicted or explained atomic spectra , lasers , antimatter , semiconductors , superconductivity , and who knows ? perhaps in the future the big bang itself . I can hardly ask for more . " " But I must . I must seek a theory that is aesthetically satisfying , too . And it will never be quantum theory . Perhaps I ask for too much , but I seem to have no choice . " We must leave Albert and Niels with their conflict unresolved and go on to see how the physics community at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXPERIMENT In an effort to clarify the confusion surrounding the EPR paper , a British physicist , John Bell , developed a clear mathematical statement of the conflict discussed above by Einstein and Bohr . Bell was able to demonstrate the logical incompatibility between the predictions of quantum theory and any assumed causal behavior among elementary particles . This is often referred to as Bell 's theorem . Based on his theorem , Bell was able to suggest specific experiments that would distinguish unequivocally between quantum probability and space-time causality . For practic al reasons , Bell modified the original experiment suggested by EPR , which was too difficult to do in practice . But the new experiments would demonstrate even more dramatically the same conflict between inferential measurements and the uncertainty principle . A series of experiments based on Bell 's suggestion were carried out in Paris in the 1980s by Alain Aspect and his // associates . Rather than measuring the momentum of electrons , Aspect measured the polarization of photons , which can be done much more accurately . Polarization is subject to a different conservation law ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rotational or angular motion of material bodies . The basic idea was the same ? to observe the polarization of two correlated photons ( rather than the momentum of two correlated electrons ) , and to see whether measuring one photon had any statistical effect on the other . Aspect 's results as interpreted by Bell 's theorem vindicated the probabilistic predictions of quantum theory , beyond any reasonable doubt . The experiments seemed to show that one photon somehow " knows " what the other is doing . Measuring the polarization of one of the photons has an apparent effect on the other , even though there is no mechanism by which they can " communicate . " Uncertainty or probability seems to pass magically from one photon to the other and to affect its statistical behavior . In one of the experiments , there was not enough time for a signal ? even at the speed of light ? to travel from one photon to the other . It seemed impossible for the photons to " communicate " with and influence each other . Yet they did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be real and to occur instantaneously . EPR had always assumed that if a physical quantity ( momentum or polarization , for example ) can be measured without disturbing the system , then that quantity must have an independent objective reality . But neither the inferred momentum of an electron nor the inferred polarization of a photon can exhibit such an independent objective existence . EPR had assumed objectivity and causality and concluded that quantum theory was incomplete . Bell and Aspect , however , had demonstrated the completeness of quantum theory . One must therefore choose to give up either objectivity or causality ( or both ) . Not much of a choice for Einstein ( or for the rest of us ) ! // QUANTUM THEORY A LA MODE The perfect track record of quantum theory is hard to argue with , and yet the Copenhagen view of nature sticks in the craw of many physicists . Many physicists pay lip service to Bohr but secretly sympathize with Einstein . Few scientists can genuinely accept the idea that they are creating their reality as they observe it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments and observations ; we ca n't just be making it up . Yet many of the abstractions of quantum theory have the quality of fantasy and imagination . There 's no arguing with the magical products of quantum theory or the results of such crucial " philosophical " experiments as those of Aspect . Quantum weirdness and illogic are here to stay . And so a number of imaginative and philosophically-minded physicists have proposed new interpretations in an effort to tame the wild quantum beast . Heinz Pagels and Henry Stapp claim that there is no real violation of causality . ' In the Aspect experiments , the polarization of many paired photons is measured . The data for each separate photon is random . We see no pattern or correlations until we compare the data for the pairs of photons . If you examine a mixed deck of playing cards , you will find no special order or pattern . If , however , you should find a second deck with its cards in exactly the same order as the first , you would know that someone had carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any " arranging " until you examined the two decks together . We can never make use of the " communication " between the two photons . Their mutual " influences " are apparent only long after the fact , when we correlate or compare the data from the two photons . Thus no violation of causality occurs in real time , and no faster-than-light effects can ever be observed directly or used to send infor- Igo PHYSICS FOR THE REST OF US mation . Pagels does n't deny the violation of causality , he simply relegates it to the realm of the unobservable , along with electrons in the atom and motion in space-time . An Einstein , however , might still worry about those spooky skeletons in the closet . Of course , for Bohr , all of this is a tempest in a teapot . He always insisted that the components of a quantum system , including the measuring instruments , can not be taken apart or treated separately . The parts can not " influence " each other . Quantum theory deals only with an indivisible unified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any given experiment , including Aspect 's . There is no use seeking the " mechanism " behind the readings . It has nothing to do with science . Bohr 's view is consistent and functional , but a bit Spartan for most people . Abner Shimony , a philosophically minded contemporary physicist , has a different way of interpreting quantum reality . He argues that probability and chance are not mathematical abstractions but objective properties of nature.5 The indefinite location of an electron in an atom is not a matter of limited information but of physical reality . The electron exists in a state that is physically indefinite . It 's as if the odds on a horse race were not a calculation in someone 's mind or in a computer but actually existed somewhere in physical reality ? on the track , perhaps , or in the horses ' hooves ! This differs from Bohr 's view . Bohr says we have only statistical information on the whereabouts of an electron . When we look for an electron , quantum theory gives us the odds of finding it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character in space-time , which we directly observe . It is n't the information that is statistical , but the electron itself . This contrasts with Bohr , who says we know nothing about the space-time character of the electron . // And then there 's the many-worlds interpretation of Hugh Everett.6 There is no contradiction among the various complementary views , nor is there any statistical character to reality . All possible locations of an electron , all correlations of photons , all possible wave and particle manifestations of matter and energy ? all of these are occurring together in parallel space-times . The world splits into infinitely many worlds each time an experiment is performed . The many worlds represent the myriad possible results of an experiment that are predicted by quantum theory . The electron goes through the first hole in one world and the second hole in another . There is no probability . Everything that is possible simply happens . Reality is a superspace of infinitely-many constantly dividing worlds . Quantum theory does not give us the odds in a game of craps but rather a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split apart with each throw of the dice . One wonders which is worse : the malady or the cure ? QUANTUM THEORY VS . CLASSICAL PHYSICS The superior ability of quantum theory to deal accurately and consistently with atoms , lasers , x-rays , superconductivity , and countless other things has allowed the new theory almost completely to eclipse the older classical one . But we still use Newtonian mechanics on the everyday terrestrial scale and even in the space program . The clash persists between the old familiar concepts and the new revolutionary ones . The laws of the macroworld remain stubbornly deterministic , while those of the microworld are ironically probabilistic . Our kinematics of projectiles and comets has a pronounced visual character , while atomic descriptions have none . The world of shoes and ships and sealing wax seems to endure between our observations , while electrons and atoms have no actual or physical status beyond our // measurements . The interpretations of quantum theory that we 've discussed do n't alleviate the conflict ; if anything , they widen the gap between the two worlds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They go right on about their business , largely ignoring the philosophical debates and existential conflicts . After all , physics works : it accurately predicts natural phenomena and permits us to control them . Philosophy is irrelevant . But the anguished protests of such great physicists as Einstein and Erwin Schrodinger belie the complacency of the majority . ( Erwin Schrodinger was one of the founding fathers of quantum theory , but he came to have serious disagreement with the Cophenhagen interpretation . ) The violence that quantum theory does to our deep beliefs and assumptions can not be sustained . The philosophical and spiritual implications of physics weigh heavily on the human heart . We can not forever endure an impossible boundary between two worlds . // Objectivity , Measurement , and Reality QUANTUM THEORY MAY OR MAY NOT describe the inner workings of a " real " microworld , but it certainly makes very accurate predictions about actual experimental observations . Accordingly , most twentieth-century physicists still claim to be dealing with an objective reality . This traditional claim rests largely on quantitative techniques that make possible the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different observers can agree , say , on the length of a table , we infer that the table has an " objective " status , independent of who measures it or how . It seems to exist in physical reality , independent of us and our observations . But the concept of measurement is not entirely free of subjective judgment or of logical fallacies , as we shall see . How then can it be a guarantee of objectivity ? Claims of scientific objectivity are also based on the generality of scientific law . Because the same laws apply to elect runs , jet planes , and stars , we assume that these laws embody a universal truth that is independent of observers and lawmakers . But criteria like generality , consistency , 1QA // accuracy , economy , and simplicity are neither objective nor inherent in nature . They are aesthetic choices , which reveal the subjective judgments and predilections that are inevitably built into science . THE FOLLY OF THE QUANTITATIVE The sciences generally , and physics in particular , pride themselves on their quantitative character . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningful and objective than qualitative ones . This amounts to a bias , which is reflected in our culture at large . Less quantitative fields , such as sociology and literature , imitate physics by trying to be as quantitative as possible . Wars and catastrophes are assessed largely in terms of numbers of deaths and quantity of destruction . Even our primary emphasis on money as a measure of wealth and value is an example of the attempt to reduce everything to quantity . These are presumably the most " objective " measures . All of this amounts to a kind of folly of the quantitative that influences us in many subtle but powerful ways . The organization of our high schools , colleges , and professional lives confronts us with a difficult choice at a fairly early stage in our schooling . We must decide whether to emphasize the sciences or the humanities in our studies . Most of us naturally gravitate toward one or the other . Some lean more heavily on their logical , empirical , quantitative skills , while others depend more on their intuitive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no sharp boundary between the two approaches , nor do we ever use one entirely to the exclusion of the other . People depend and rely on both kinds of abilities . Nevertheless , by predilection , social indoctrination , and schooling , we tend to choose between the sciences and the humanities in our educational and professional lives . On the face of it , there seems to be nothing wrong with this . Variety is the spice of life , and the success of our // society depends on people with a diversity of interests and talents . The problem , however , does not lie in the existence of these differences but rather in our attitudes toward them . We do not treat scientific and humanistic professions as equals . What is it that our society tends to value , support , and reward the most ? It is all the technological wonders and conveniences of modern life ? heart transplants , CAT scans , computers , VCRs , lasers , the space program , the modern automobile , and jet travel . Of course , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not to the same degree as technology . This is reflected , for example , in the difference between the annual budgets of the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities , or in the contrast between the typical salary of an engineer and a dancer . There are four Nobel prizes in the sciences ? physics , chemistry , medicine , and economics , one for literature , none for art or music . This exaggerated emphasis on the quantitative has a dehumanizing effect on all of us . It tends to devalue and discredit many subjective experiences that are emotional , psychological , aesthetic , ethical , qualitative , ecstatic , symbolic , philosophical , spiritual , eloquent , imaginative , lofty , passionate , enlightening , or sublime . Only what is objective matters . The dominance of quantity also contributes to the fears and anxieties associated with subjects like physics and mathematics . But is the reliance on quantity as a guarantor of objectivity justified , even in science ? QUANTITY AND OBJECTIVITY In physics , the quantitative approach reigns supreme . Physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact " and thus the most objective of the sciences . Qualitat ive as well as quantitative descriptions of organisms , rock strata , and compounds may be permissible in biology , geology , and chemistry . But in physics , all natural laws and all objective descriptions of phenomena are stated in // mathematical terms , as are the definitions of all physical quantities . The very word quantity is used in physics to refer almost exclusively to any relevant or important characteristic of the physical world . Temperature may be defined either empirically ? as the length of the mercury column in a thermometer ? or theoretically ? as a measure of the average kinetic energy of molecules . And , of course , length and kinetic energy are themselves defined quantitatively . In fact , the formal definition of any quantity in physics is not an explanation but a prescription for its measurement . Speed is the distance an object travels divided by the time it takes . From the point of view of physics , the definition of speed is an operational procedure , which specifies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such " operational definitions " are the stock-in-trade of physicists . A physical quantity is a useful objective description only when it can be measured . Measuring something implies assigning a number to it , and numbers are what quantification is all about . Once some property of a body or of matter or of space-time is measured and quantified , it can be incorporated into a mathematical statement ? a quantitative law of nature ? and then used to make quantitative tests and predictions in the real world . So the ability to measure and the techniques for assigning numbers to things are central to the methods and applications of physics . Because the laws of physics are expressed almost exclusively in terms of measured quantities , scientists believe that physics describes an objective physical reality , which is independent of our observations and experiments . We have seen that quantum theory raises some serious doubts about this objectivity . But the remarkable track record of physics in dealing with the material world is sufficient proof for most scientists that they are dealing with an objective independent reality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the properties of a semiconductor , or the range and power of a laser beam , it is the agreement between // quantitative predictions and experimental measurements that gives physics its power and reputation . Such consistently accurate agreement is presumably the result of the objectivity of physics ? of the precise correspondence between physical law and the external , objective world . If I measure the frequency of an electromagnetic wave , and if I do it carefully enough , then I know that any other observer will independently measure the same frequency . I naturally assume that we are each observing some aspect of an external independent reality . Anyone observing the same wave will measure the same frequency because that wave is not affected by or dependent on the observer in any way . Quantitative measurement seems to guarantee that the wave is part of an independent objective reality . THE MEASURE OF ALL THINGS But is measurement truly a guarantor of objectivity ? To find out , we are going to examine in some detail the process of making a measurement . We 'll take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We choose the measurement of length for two reasons . First , length is simple to understand , both conceptually and in practice . Second , the measurement of length is basic to just about every other quantity in physics . We know , for example , that speed is defined in terms of the measurement of length and time . All concepts in physics ? force , energy , momentum , temperature , pressure ? are defined ultimately in terms of a few fundamental quantities ? primarily length and time . ' For convenience , the standard system of measuring units in science takes as fundamental a half dozen quantities and defines everything else in terms of them . But in principle , one fundamental quantity is all we need . The quantitative operational definition of all the quantities // used in physics can be based on a single fundamental measurement ? length . Length is fundamental to all measurement in physics and to its quantitative character . But if the procedure for measuring length is not purely objective , then that would repudiate any objective basis for physics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal operational point of view is equivalent to defining length . There are three steps in the process of measuring length : 1 ) defining limits , 2 ) comparing with a standard of length ( a meterstick ) , and 3 ) counting . What we shall discover is that in each of the three steps , one of two assumptions will be necessary ? either a subjective judgment must be made or else we must assume a prior definition of length . Any use of subjective judgment will clearly negate the purely objective character of the process . A definition that is based on itself is circular and therefore a logical fallacy . Furthermore , since a circular definition assumes we know what length is when we 're trying to define it , we are incorporating an element of tacit or prior human knowledge into the definition , which makes it subjective . In either of the two cases , subjectivity is unavoidable . Thus , a definition of length that is formally equivalent to the measurement of length can never be objective . And such a definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length ) can not be used as an objective basis for science . Step 1 : I shall illustrate the three steps by performing a " thought measurement " of the length of a rectangular table ? let 's say of its longer dimension . First , I must determine the limits ( or corners ) of the long edge of the table so I will know just what to measure . For example , I need to know exactly where to place the end of my ruler . How can I specify this limiting point ? I could simply gauge it by eye , but of course , that would be a subjective judgment . I could use a magnifying glass or a blown-up photograph , but ultimately I 'd still have to judge whether the end of the ruler and the table line up . To remove myself from the decision-making process , I might try to specify the exact // position of the corner for some sensing device and computer to locate . But to specify a position , I need to give its distances from some points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengths , and so I must use the concept of length in defining length . ( Not kosher ! ) Alternatively , I might try to specify the end of the table in terms of its atomic constituents . But even if I ( or some device ) could see these atoms , they would be in constant motion , and , in any event , establishing their position or distribution would once again require a prior knowledge of length . I would need to use either human judgment or a measurement of length to decide where the atoms " thin out " enough to constitute the end of the table . There is no way to locate the corners of the table without making a value judgment or else using a previous definition of length . Step 1 is either subjective or circular . ( And a circular definition , as we 've argued above , is also subjective . ) Step 2 : The second step is to compare the specified length of the table to some standard unit of length ? meters or inches or light-years . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of step 1 and assume I have managed somehow to line up the zero end of my meterstick with one corner of the table . In order to compare the length of the table with standard meters , I must now determine the mark on my meterstick that most closely lines up with the other corner of the table . Let 's suppose the end point at the other corner of the table ( however I manage to determine it ) falls somewhere between the 3.25 and 3.26 marks on my meterstick . Either the end point falls very close to one of the two markers or between them . In order to compare with meters and ultimately count them , I must judge the relative posit ion and proximity of the two markers on the meterstick and the end point of the table . For the sake of argument , I 'll call the two marks on the meterstick points A and B and the point at the corner of the table P. I must decide whether P is between A and B and then whether P is closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , make this judgment subjectively by eyeballing the three points . But that would mean my comparison is not purely objective . What other choices do I have ? To determine the order and relative proximities of points A , P , and B , I must do two things : first , identify and distinguish the relevant points from other points , and second , measure the relative distances between them . Identifying points , or anything else for that matter , is something that human beings do very well , but of course by using subjective judgment . To eliminate the subjective element , I might try to use a computer or other automated sensing device . How do you teach a computer to recognize and identify a point , or any object , let 's say an octopus or a particular human face ? This is an extremely difficult task . Computers are no match for humans when it comes to pattern recognition . To the extent that it can be done at all , features and characteristics must be specified by their positions ? a tentacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prior knowledge of length , as we 've seen , which makes our definition circular again . To make matters worse , we are dealing here not with recognizing octopi and people but with recognizing mere points . The computer must identify points A and B on a meterstick and P at the end of the table . Points have no characteristics other than their positions , and positions are specified by distances or lengths . Again we are trapped in a circle that requires a knowledge of length in order to define it . Simply identifying points for the purpose of comparing a length to standard meters requires either subjective judgment or a prior knowledge of length . Once the points are identified , judging their proximity ( or relative distances ) involves the same dilemma ? a choice between subjectivity and circularity ( also ultimately subjective ) . So much for step 2 . Step 3 : The third and final step involves counting . How many meters long is our table ? Surely , there can be nothing subjective about counting . Make no mistake about // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very heart of quantification and scientific objectivity . We base our belief in an objective world on our ability to assign numbers to things unambiguously , consistently , and reproducibly , i.e. , to count . But can we actually count without making subjective judgments ? Defining numbers for the purpose of counting is no easy task . The history of mathematics itself is tantamount to the gradual evolution and refinement of the concept of number , which has grown more and more abstract over the centuries . Numbers are best defined today in terms of the theory of sets . In mathematics , a set is an abstract generalization of the idea of groups or collections of things ? any things at all , in any quantity . A set contains elements , like geese in a gaggle or sand grains on a beach or marks on a meterstick . In trying to size up or measure the elements in a set , we become involved in the definition of number . Assigning numbers to elements in set theory requires that I make a one-to-one comparison between the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the elements of some standard set . A standard set of three elements has its " threeness " in common with any other set of three elements ? three geese , three marks , etc . This may sound redundant , but I can avoid counting or relying on any previously memorized sequence of integers by comparing the members of each set one by one . Suppose my standard " 3 " set contains the elements labeled X , Y , and Z. I make a comparison in which I associate X with goose Gloria , Y with Sebastian , and Z with Ferdinand . I find that each and every element of my standard " 3 " set corresponds uniquely to one and only one goose in my comparison set.Therefore , I know that the two sets have the same number of elements and that I have three geese . In this way , I can establish the sequence of numbers by using my standard sets . I order them by observing which sets have " leftover " elements in my one-to-one comparisons . The great nineteenth-century German mathemati202 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this same procedure to develop an arithmetic of infinitely large sets.2 You never need a number , only a one-to-one comparison to establish the equivalence of sets . I can identify and label the standard sets by beginning with the so-called empty set ( the set with no elements ) and adding one element to it at a time . ( If all of this seems unnecessarily labored and finicky , I can assure you that defining numbers is one of the most difficult of all tasks in mathematics . It 's necessary because we are seeking an objective definition of numbers and counting . And we are by no means doing it fully rigorously . ) So my final task in measuring the length of the table is to count the meters . I must compare the individual meters laid along the edge of the table with the standard sets of 2 , 3 , 4 ( and so on ) elements.3 But before I can make the necessary one-to-one matching , I must first identify uniquely and unequivocally the members of each set ? meters and standard elements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as geese , octopi , meters , points ? is the same obstacle that blocked me in step 2 . Either I rely on my intuitive , subjective ability to articulate and identify objects , or I must use a prior definition of length in trying to instruct a computer how to do the same thing . Even if computers could do well at recognizing patterns , they could n't do so without using length . So even the final crucial step of counting is either subjective or circular . We ca n't even count objectively . Thus at each of the three steps involved in measuring length , which is equivalent to the formal operational definition of length , it is necessary in practice to make a subjective value judgment because a circular definition also involves subjective judgment . There is no purely obOBJECTIVITY , // jective way in practice to define or perform a measurement of length , or of any other physical quantity . SUREFIRE PREDICTION Pure measurement in itself is not objective , which means that science is not objective . We might end the whole matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of objectivity . Scientists can still believe they are dealing with an objective world because of the predictive power and generality of the laws of physics . We can predict an eclipse of the sun or the behavior of superconductors with impressive accuracy . Of course , accuracy in prediction is based on the ability to measure , which as we 've seen is fundamentally subjective . But still , something about the predictive power and generality of scientific laws lures us into believing in an objective world . Such a believer might argue along the following lines : " We may quibble philosophically over the definition of measured quantities in physics , but the remarkable consistency and accuracy of prediction in physics could result only from studying and describing a single objective independent reality . Any other subjective explanation ? a mentally dependent or personally invented world ? strains reason and requires too many accidental coincidences and arbitrary assumptions . If Mars is a figment of your imagination , " the believer in objectivity continues , " then why is it the same as my Mars ? In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why should two imaginary Marses always appear at the same place in the skies and obey the same law of gravity ? Physics works as well as it does simply because it tells it like it is . It describes the real world out there as accurately and faithfully as possible . " But the story of prediction is not quite so simple . Like measurement , it harbors an essential and irreducible subject ivity . When I predict some future position of Mars for you to // verify , I rely on your knowledge of a number of tacit and conventional assumptions . For example , you must use the same system for measuring , describing , and surveying space as I do . It 's no good my giving you the " coordinates " of Mars for a certain future date and hour unless we are completely agreed on how to measure space and time . Is this purely a matter of convention ? After all , the centimeters and light-years and seconds are not built into the fabric of space-time . We impose them . We choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be done purely objectively , as we 've already seen . But the element of choice goes beyond the method of measurement . For example , when I use such concepts ( or quantities ) as distance , velocity , and acceleration in making my predictions , I use quantities that have been chosen for their convenience , reproducibility , and consistency ? characteristics that I desire ( perhaps unconsciously ) to incorporate into my predictive scientific theory . My predictions ( and the whole Newtonian system of mechanics ) are based on a mathematical technique for transforming information about forces into information about motion . Newton 's laws relate the force of gravity on Mars to the acceleration of Mars . The mathematics of calculus enables us to transform acceleration first into speed and then into position ( or vice versa ) . This reversible transformation from acceleration to speed and then to position is central to the whole method of Newtonian physics . It is based on well-known mathematical procedures ( also invented by Newton ) . But it also depends on the definitions of acceleration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the distance a body travels divided by the time it takes ? chosen as the relevant measure of motion ? Why not distance multiplied by time or distance squared divided by time ? Other measures of motion can be defined that are useful in certain applications . ' // But the standard definition of speed is the one that works in the transformation of acceleration to speed to position , which is central to Newtonian prediction . In other words , the conventional definitions are tailored to make prediction possible . My prediction of Mars requires that we agree not only on space-time measurement but also on the definitions and descriptions of motion . The whole system of measurement and prediction is designed and engineered to fulfill the goal of prediction . It 's like designing a game . It 's no surprise to anyone that checkmate is the usual outcome of a game of chess . The board , the moves of the chessmen , and the rules of the game are all designed with the aim of winning by checking the king . But if one chess player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he were playing Monopoly , he 'd be laughed out of the game ( or committed to an asylum ) . Chess was n't designed to do everything . Neither was physics . Physics was designed to make predictions , and in this respect relativity and quantum theory are no different from Newtonian physics . If a theory , together with its defined quantities and methodology , can not make verifiable predictions , then it is not science as it is conceived today ? certainly it is not physics . To argue on the contrary ( as a believer in objectivity might do ) that physics is not contrived but simply describes what is ? physical reality ? is to ignore all the choices , conventions , definitions , assumptions , beliefs , and tacit knowledge built into science , all of which could have been selected in countless ways , other than the traditional ways of science . Even the so-called mathematical structure of the physical world ? the fact that nature imitates equations and geometry ? is something of a hype . What we define today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the choices were made largely by thinkers such as Descartes and Galileo . The physical reality we take for granted is primarily defined by successful physical theories ? theories whose domain of application and methodology have been // created and refined until they fit together like hand in glove . Of course it all works . It was designed to . The system of science is by now so complex , intricate , and familiar that it is difficult to realize that it was the creation of human minds , involving arbitrary and subjective choices and limits . An analogy might help : If you read an airline schedule , you can find out when you will leave Denver and arrive in Cleveland . If the planes fly on time , the schedule is a kind of predictive system . But it ca n't tell you when you will arrive at your sister-in-law 's house in Shaker Heights . If you complain to the airline , they 'll tell you that air travel is limited to designated locations . The schedule was n't made to solve all problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science and the questions it chooses to answer are all part of one self-consistent and self-defined system . It is a remarkably useful and valuable system , but its use and value can not guarantee its truth content or its correspondence to any objective reality . We can not base any objective or realistic status of science on its ability to make verifiable predictions . That is what it was designed to do , just as chess was designed to lead to checkmate . We can not argue that the success of science establishes its validity . That it is successful is undeniable , but the ability to accomplish a goal is no guarantee of truth or objectivity . If a baseball team wins the world series , we say that it is a great baseball team , not that it establishes the validity of baseball . Science is a human activity , and like all human activities , it was created with specific purposes and goals in mind . The purposes and goals were not written down in advance any more than were those of baseball . Science and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in the course of time . But we can hardly use the finely tuned correspondence between science and its goals as a measure of its validity . Predictive power has subjectivity written all over it . It does not prove the objectivity of science or the reality of the physical world it describes . // GENERATING GENERALITIES There remains another last-ditch argument that the believer in objectivity might advance : " Even if measurement and prediction can not guarantee truth , then surely the universality of physical law must . We use the very same laws to describe a falling apple and the orbiting moon . Mars , Jupiter , and ballistic missiles all obey the law of gravity . Is n't that too much of a coincidence to attribute to our subjective choices , designs , and goals for science ? " Here we see the temptation to attribute an objective status to our observations of patterns and coincidences and theories that accentuate them . The ancient Greeks saw a uniform pattern in the motion of the stars across the skies . For them , it reflected the universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the general pattern . The disobedient stars were called planets or wanderers by the Greeks . Planets strayed from the beaten path and seemed to violate the universal cosmic harmony . So great was the faith in this universal harmony , however , that Greek philosophers and astronomers strove through the centuries to " save the appearances " of the heavens ? to reconcile the apparent irregular motions of the planets with what must be the universal behavior of all heavenly bodies . The quest for a universal description of the heavens continued for two thousand years until Newton discovered ( created ? ) the universal laws of planetary motion . Newton went the Greeks one better ? he applied the same laws on earth and in the heavens . The universality of the Newtonian system is one of its most impressive features . Relativity and quantum theory have eclipsed Newtonian mechanics not only because they provide more accurate predictions but also because they are more universal in scope . But do missiles , planets , and stars really move according to the same laws ? Do even the planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other planets // because of its closeness to the sun . Each planet is perturbed differently by the size and proximity of its nearest neighbors . Other correction factors require that we combine observation , calculation , and theory to achieve the accuracy required for the space program . Theory alone is inadequate . In practice , we can not apply one simple general law to describe the detailed motion of the planets . Physicists may argue that the laws are perfectly general but that the number and size of the " corrections " varies from case to case . But once we agree that each case must be treated individually , who is to say what is general and what is particular ? To argue that the underlying laws are general and the corrections are particular is to beg the question . We call psychotics abnormal because it suits us to believe that the " normal " majority is not psychotic ( despite the fact that social behavior on the large scale is demonstrably psychotic ) . We could equally well have a theory of human behavior that treats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generalized . Such a theory might be cumbersome and inconvenient , but that would neither prove nor disprove its validity . Indeed , universality is a utilitarian choice as well as an aesthetic one . As for the missiles and the stars , their motion is affected by so many and such different factors that one could easily raise questions about the whole notion of Newtonian generality . ' The new science of chaos also suggests that for any but the simplest Newtonian problems , the behavior of objects is so sensitive to initial conditions and to prevailing conditions that the universal laws can no longer make meaningful predictions in practice . What we really mean by universality is an ordered // repeated pattern that departs from some background of disorder or chaos . In universal order it is the unexpected departure from randomness that attracts and delights us , and which we choose to favor in our theories . The properties of the chemical elements are not random . They display a repeating order that reflects the universal symmetry of the quantum states of the atom . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasize the similarities in developing a universal theory for them . Nor are the quantum states exactly symmetrical . The many electrons in an atom perturb each others ' states as do the planets in the Solar System . Only through the use of simplified generalizing assumptions can we arrive at approximate descriptions of complex atoms . Even the mighty computer is stymied in the effort to generalize the complex uranium atom from the simple atom of hydrogen . We naturally opt for commonality , analogy , generality . Jules-Henri Poincare , the great nineteenth-century French philosopher and mathematician , says that when we follow our instincts for order , harmony , and universality , we select our facts from the realms of the macroscopic and the microscopic . ' It is much easier to find the exceptional , the improbable , and the general in what is remote . Newton 's generality revealed the unseen order in earthbound motion by studying the remote planets . What could be more unlikely , more universal , than a common law to describe the collisions of electrons , missiles , and stars ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reduce it to its basic elements , and analyze it with an imitative theory from another area . The very processes of simplification and reduction are guided by human values ? by an instinct for unity , simplicity , and generality . ' These are useful , meaningful , and desirable characteristics iii a theory , but they represent creative choices of the human imagination , not proofs of objectivity and reality . Whether we examine measurement , prediction , or // generality , we find the stamp of human subjectivity indelibly imprinted on the methods and laws of physics . It may be convenient in dealing with a certain realm of human experience to assume the existence of an objective science and an external independent reality . But convenience and aesthetic choices , no matter how effective and traditional they are , must not be taken for absolute truth . The criteria for judging the value and validity of science can not be dictated by science itself , but must come instead from a broader region of human understanding and wisdom . // Physics and Consciousness IN CLASSICAL PHYSICS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer could always minimize or remove all of his or her traces from the observation . There was an objective world out there that was unaffected by human observation of it . At the same time , it was assumed that consciousness , like life itself , somehow evolved out of inert matter . Consciousness would ultimately be explained as the result of complex chemical and physical phenomena in the brain . Because consciousness did not affect phenomena and was ultimately a kind of by-product of the laws of matter , it was quite irrelevant to classical physics . In twentieth-century physics , however , the mind seems once again to have reared its ugly head . More prominence is given to the role of the observer . In relativity , this is mostly a matter of language . It is the frame of reference , and not its occupants , that determines the properties of space-time . In quantum theory , the observer seems to affect what is observed . Does this mean that consciousness plays an essential role in physical phenomena ? Is quantum theory really " user friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIND IN NEWTONIAN SCIENCE As a result of Newton 's brilliant synthesis , a new mechanical picture of the world came to prevail in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . The universe consisted of infinite empty absolute space , stretching in all directions . Dispersed through this space were infinitely many particles of matter , whose motions were governed passively by the law of inertia and actively by the law of gravity . The " active " force of gravity had always troubled Newton . He wanted a purely mechanical or corpuscular explanation for the force of gravity ? more like the approach of Descartes . For Newton , the mysterious force of attraction between all particles smacked too much of Aristotelian occultism ? the seeking out by bodies of their " natural " place in the hierarchy of the elements . ' But the great success of Newton 's method carried the day . Most scientists ( including Newton ) believed that the metaphysical problem of the origin of gravity would eventually be solved . ' For the moment , however , all phenomena were to be explained in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conception of the universe left little room for the intercession or influence of any form of mind or spirit , whether divine or human . Possibly , God was needed to set the particles in motion , as in Descartes ' universe of circulating vortices . But once the initial impetus had been given in the creation , neither God nor anyone else was needed to keep the clockwork universe running and developing its myriad forms . Thus we have a clear conception of an objective reality , independent of thought or consciousness . Human beings might observe the workings of the universe , even provide a brilliant description and explanation of them . But human influence on those workings was incidental , // minimal , and decidedly not fundamental . Consciousness enabled us to study and interpret nature but was not central to it . Indeed , consciousness and the life forms from which it evolved were themselves products of the activity of the inert particles . Consciousness was a secondary , derivative phenomenon in the universe . Only the particles and their interactions were fundamental . The notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler fundamental ones is called reductionism . Consciousness can be reduced to biology , biology to chemistry , chemistry to physics , and physics to the activity of the fundamental inert particles . For example , if one had sufficiently detailed knowledge of the behavior of elementary particles , one presumably could have predicted the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall ! The Newtonian scheme fostered and encouraged a deep belief in reductionism , which has largely persisted into the twentieth century.3 Reductionism goes hand in hand with materialism ? the belief that inert matter is the source of all phenomena ? to provide the prevailing " metaphysics " of classical science . Reductionism , together with materialism , excludes consciousness from any fundamental role in the universe . The objective world exists , is independent of us , and is oblivious of our existence . But we and our consciousness are not independent of it . On the contrary , we are a direct consequence of the inert particles . Newtonian physics obliterated the Cartesian separation of mind and matter . Mind is a product of matter . How does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics ? CONSCIOUSNESS IN MODERN PHYSICS On the surface , relativity and quantum theory seem to return consciousness ? in the guise of the observer ? to a // central role in physics . In relativity , the measurement of space , time , and matter is different for different observers . The train and platform observers , as we saw earlier , differ in determining the simultaneity of two events . In quantum theory , Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle tells us that an observer has a random and irreducible effect on any observation . Whether an electron acts like a wave or a particle depends on how you observe it . All of this has rekindled the hopes of some who search for deeper unity and equality between mind and body and who seek more meaning and purpose in the cosmic plan . Advocates of free will , who felt defeated by Newtonian determinism , now feel vindicated by quantum randomness at the heart of matter . Others find a mental structure in the quantum and relativistic worldviews that is reminiscent of the cosmic consciousness of Eastern philosophy and religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see whether it is really any friendlier to consciousness than classical physics was . The role of consciousness in relativity is actually rather superficial . It is not really the observer but her reference frame that determines the outcome of space-time measurements . To speak of an observer in relativity is more or less a linguistic convenience . It does not even imply a live being . For example , an automated observation performed by a computerized telescope on board a high-speed rocket in outer space constitutes a perfectly good observation , which would obey the laws of relativity whether the rocket is manned or not . The theory of relativity does not actually imply that the consciousness of an observer has any effect on measurements of the physical world . In quantum theory , the situation is more subtle . As in relativity , a quantum observation does not actually require a conscious or live observer . In fact , an observation , according to some physicists , requires nothing more than the recording of information irreversibly in time . Some irreversible process ? a chemical change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sufficient for an observation whether it 's ever seen by a live observer or not . ' In contrast to relativity , the choice of the kind of observation has a critical effect on the phenomenon . Choices , however , need not be made by a living being . They can be selected randomly by an automated device from some predetermined alternatives . Some of the EPR test experiments work in this way , with the choice of observing electron waves or particles made arbitrarily.5 Furthermore , the act of observation itself , even if performed by a conscious observer , involves no higher function of consciousness such as thinking , imagination , or will . It is pure dumb and blind raw sentience that affects phenomena ? a passive act of perception by an unconscious ( or , at least , an unself-conscious ) mind . An observing worm would presumably have the same effect on an electron as we do . Thus , as far as pure observation in quantum theory is concerned , consciousness is either completely unnecessary or , if it is involved at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious sensation . Incidentally , according to Bohr , quantum theory does not really distinguish between observations and phenomena , as we have already seen . Quantum laws tell us only the results of specific experiments in which the phenomena and the observational apparatus are treated as an inseparable whole . Quantum theory makes no direct statement about a natural world that is independent of our observations . The peculiarities of our language and of our classic al concepts make it almost impossible to talk of a syntheslied observer-phenomenon . If we take all of this at face value , then we can not properly draw any conclusions from quantum theory about an independent consciousness . Bohr recognized this as a fundamental obstacle in any . // attempt to extend quantum theory to a broader realm of phenomena , which might include consciousness.6 But we shall continue to follow the more conventional approach of reasoning about an objective world that is separate from its observers . There is one final argument ? probably the strongest ? against thinking that quantum theory might assign any essential role to consciousness . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reductionist as Newtonian physics . Whatever role consciousness may play in nature , its ultimate scientific explanation must be given in terms of the laws governing the behavior of matter . The fundamental elements of all natural phenomena are the elementary particles and their interactions . Life and consciousness are simply complex examples of their activity . Consciousness is no independent force or principle in nature ; it is an " epiphenomenon , " an unusual but inevitable consequence of the laws of inanimate matter . It may be a difficult and lengthy road to travel , but the explanation of consciousness ( as of life itself ) will be reduced , sooner or later , to the laws of physics . Taken as a whole , these arguments and considerations make clear that consciousness is not a welcome guest in modern physics . But is this the end of the matter ? Can physics and chemistry ever give a complete and sufficient explanation for life and consciousness ? And can science continue indefinitely to deny the fundamental nature of the human experience of mind and consciousness ? The scientific rift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human heart . It can not be left unattended . SUBJECTIVE ELEMENTS IN PHYSICS Whatever the " official " position of physics toward the human mind may be , there is a great deal of indirect // evidence to suggest more than merely a facilitative role for human consciousness and creativity in science . Many great physical scientists have given accounts of the vital part played by imagination ? and even dreams ? in their scientific creations ? Einstein , Friedrich Kekule , Henri Poincare , Erwin Schrodinger , Paul Dirac , and Freeman Dyson , to name only a few . Einstein underwent a profound change of heart in his attitude toward science as the result of the inspiration and insight that led to his general theory of relativity . His youthful advocacy of the empiricist position ( the laws of science can logically be deduced simply from the observation of natural phenomena ) eventually gave way to his more mature faith in human intuition as the source of scientific theories . As he states it , " Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the external world . " Friedrich Kekule was an architect turned chemist . His discovery of the ringlike form of the benzene molecule was inspired by a dream he had one night in 1865 . In his vision , Kekule saw a snake biting its own tail while whirling in a circle . The benzene carbon ring was the key to the modern structural theory of organic chemistry . Poincare traces the choice of " facts " in science to aesthetic criteria of convenience , simplicity , and elegance . Dirac is famous for placing beauty above factuality in evaluating theories of physics . Clearly , there is more to science than just " getting the facts . " There are also philosophers and historians who suggest a more central role for mind and subjectivity in science . Michael Polanyi , a chemist and philosopher of science , argues that there are always tacit elements or tint unconscious dimensions in scientific knowledge that can never lw isolated from the minds in which they originate . ' Something as simple as using a meterstick or a voltmeter to // make a measurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? tacit knowledge ? that can never be fully communicated or explained and must be passed from one generation of scientists to another through body language , intuition , and imitation . But the tacit dimension permeates all aspects of science ? its definitions , concepts , theories , methods , and assumptions . The physicist and historian Gerald Holton explores the often subjective and irrational motives behind many fundamental ideas in science . ' Kepler , for instance , resisted assigning elliptical orbits to the planets for many years . In vain he struggled to preserve the pivotal role that the Neoplatonic thinkers assigned to the sun . He could not bear to displace the sun from its position at the center of all the circular planetary orbits . Kepler ultimately capitulated when he realized that the focus of an elliptical orbit plays the same role as the center point of a circle . How many pet beliefs , aesthetic choices , and irrational preferences remain incorporated even today in scientific theories ? There is even a maverick effort to combine mind and matter into a single " hologram " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pribram , a psychologist , have attempted to capitalize on the hologram structure of the mind and the physical world.9 Both human memory and the quantum description of the universe share a property in common . Every part contains information about the whole , as in a hologram . Memory is not localized but spread out or diffused in the brain . The wave function of an electron gives a very small but finite probability that the electron can be found anywhere in the universe . Thus , all wave functions overlap , and all things refer and relate to each other . In a hologram , unlike in an ordinary photograph , any section can be cut out and used to regenerate the whole image . Each portion of the hologram contains information about the whole . This led Bohm and Pribram to develop a // theory that proposes that mind and matter have the same structure and in reality are different aspects of the same thing . Finally , we find the physicist Roger Penrose questioning whether a computer will ever be able to do everything that the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being stubborn when he insisted that quantum theory was incomplete . He concludes that deeper laws than those of quantum theory are needed for the functioning of the mind . ' 0 THE EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS The conflict between physics and consciousness is deeper still . Not only may physics be incapable ever of reducing consciousness to the actions of electrons but physics itself , with all its flaws and limitations , may represent a particular stage in the evolution of consciousness . This is the contention of such critics of science as Morris Berman and Theodore Roszak , and especially Owen Barfield . " According to Barfield , the human experience of the world has evolved from an ancient organic participation with nature to our modern objectified separation from it . A study of the language and culture of ancient and primal ivilizations suggests an unfamiliar intermingling and fusion of what we think of as the psychic and physical worlds . In Platonic thought , we have already referred to an apparent equivalence between outer and inner space ? an equation , as it were , of mental and celestial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thought , perception , and sensat inn were forms of motion ? kinesis in Greek . It was as if t he kinetics of the mind and of the stars were one and the same-2 This Platonic sense of participation gradually
