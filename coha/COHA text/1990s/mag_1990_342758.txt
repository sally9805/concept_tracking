When bus drivers in Fez joined a nationwide general strike called by Morocco 's two major labor unions earlier this month , government officials thought they had a simple remedy : they put soldiers and police officers behind the wheel . <P> That proved unwise . First , a group of youths began to stone the strikebreakers ; then the violence escalated . An angry mob of 20,000  --  mostly unemployed young people  --  went on a rampage . They ransacked and set fire to the five-star Hotel Merenids , torched limousines , looted boutiques and banks . Soon disturbances spread to several other towns , including the capital , Rabat . Some witnesses reported that police fired submachine guns into crowds . Authorities say five people died ; union leaders put the toll at more than 30 . <P> Last week government officials attempted to calm emotions with a promise of unspecified increases in wages and improved social benefits . Morocco 's ills , however , are not easily fixed . Under an austerity program drawn up by the badly indebted country , only 15,210 new jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 350,000 young Moroccans who will enter the labor market .
