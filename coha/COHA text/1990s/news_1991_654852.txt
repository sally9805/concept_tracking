<p> WU AI climbs the dirt path rising from Mawen village to a grassy hillside and stops before a pile of shattered stone , the ruins of an ancestral tomb sacred to his kinsmen . <p> " The Wangs demolished it , like all the others ! " says the wiry , leather-skinned village chief , pointing to a dozen barren grave mounds scattered across the misty clearing . <p> " They are savages . But they outnumber us , so we ca n't do anything about it , " Mr. Wu fumes . <p> The deadly feud of Wus and Wangs is raging once more in this remote corner of Guangdong Province , symbolizing a dramatic revival of ancient , patriarchal clans that dominated southern China until the late 1800s . <p> Over the past decade , clans have reemerged to unite thousands of peasants in an embrace of blood , money , and ritual . Challenging the Communist Party 's grip on villages , they inspire loyalty and faith in family-centered Confucian ethics where Marxist dogma has long left a void . <p> Unable to dissolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party appears reduced to the role of mollifying clan chiefs and policing their territorial battles . <p> Strife between the powerful , far-flung Wangs and the close-huddled Wus is rooted in conflicting claims to the tranquil , auspiciously located graveyard at Mawen village . <p> Dominating the hillside is the elaborate , black-stone tomb of the Wang clan 's founding ancestor , a southern duke of the Song Dynasty ( 960-1279 ) . Each year growing numbers of Wangs join a pilgrimage to sacrifice meat , wine , and paper money to his spirit in a celebration of clan solidarity . <p> As part of the ritual " grave-sweeping , " the Wangs pick weeds and repaint the tombstone with bright red characters . They also smash or exhume " rogue " Wu graves and chop down encroaching trees to stop them from leeching the site of beneficial forces known as feng shui , or " wind and water , " in China 's ancient art of divination . <p> Mobilized for battle The feud intensified last month , when Wang elders mobilized 10,000 kin from as far away as neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 600 Wu villagers recalled their young men from nearby towns , arming them with wooden clubs and knives to " meet the enemy , " according to local newspapers . <p> Official reports say both sides sought to avenge lives lost in a bloody clash in March 1990 , when Wu kinsmen confronted some 5,000 Wangs who paraded to the grave site in 53 cars and 1,000 bicycles to celebrate qing ming , the " pure brightness " festival honoring ancestors . <p> To forestall another battle this year , regional party authorities ordered hundreds of armed police and troops to Mawen on March 29 , the date of the Wang pilgrimage . The forces encircled the village , compelling the Wus to remain indoors while they maintained order at the Wang 's festivities , Chinese officials and witnesses say . <p> The growth of such inter-clan disputes is just one sign of a broad revival of the kinship groups , Chinese scholars say . Clans are most active in China 's southern and eastern provinces of Fujian , Guangdong , Hunan , Jiangxi , and Zhejiang , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north . <p> Known as lineages among anthropologists , the groups unite the families of men who descend directly from a common male ancestor . <p> Philosophically , they espouse deep-rooted Chinese beliefs about life and death that are ritualized in ancestor worship . For clansmen , they provide a channel for achieving status , wealth , and power that they feel means the difference between immortality and melting away as a " hungry ghost " in the afterlife . <p> The kinship groups offer members a degree of economic security and a protective buffer against wai xing , or people with other surnames , and meddling government authorities . In turn , kinsmen must obey rules commonly set down in a zupu , or genealogy - a kind of clan " Who 's Who " that glorifies illustrious members and shames detractors by crossing out their names with red ink or expunging them entirely . <p> Party criticizes clans The Communist Party blames the clans for obstructing efforts to shore up its rural power base . Strengthening village party branches has been a priority since the spring of 1989 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In a recent unpublished speech , Communist Party conservative Wang Zhen reportedly criticized clans for weakening the party in rural areas , where three out of four Chinese reside . <p> " Clan power in some areas has already become a kind of private force 201 which is contending with the power of the state , " writes Qian Hang , a historian at the Shanghai Academy of Social Science who has documented the revival of clans . <p> " Peasants are transferring the trust they placed in government leaders to strongmen of the same surname and clan , " Prof. Qian asserts . <p> Chinese and Western experts agree that clans are more conservative than rebellious by nature . Enmeshed in petty rivalries , they are too fragmented to threaten an overthrow of central party rule . <p> Nevertheless , strong Chinese clans have coincided historically with flagging central rule over localities . Today , they exemplify the increased power of social groups after China began easing Mao 's totalitarian controls in 1979 . <p> Resilience of clans Life in a farming settlement of Wangs in Huanglue Township , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clans more than 40 years after the Communist Party took power and officially disbanded them . <p> On the road to Huanglue , bright green stalks of sugar cane sprout from the fields . Peasants on bicycles pass plodding water buffalo pulling wooden carts toward the cluster of red-brick homes and gray tiled roofs . <p> Villagers , all named Wang , crowd around a lively ancestral temple at noon , offering plates of steamed chicken , bowls of rice , and other dishes at the altar before taking them home in straw baskets . <p> The first question asked a stranger , even a foreign one , in the land of Wang , is : Ni xing shenma ? or " What 's your surname ? " <p> In a spacious , two-story farmhouse , Wang Bangzhang , a wizened elder of Huanglue , sits on a wooden bench and carefully opens the worn cover of the latest Wang genealogy , recorded in the Qing Dynasty ( 1644-1911 ) . <p> " Here is our earliest ancestor , " Mr. Wang smiles proudly , tapping a wrinkled forefinger on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his 26th generation descendants . " <p> An entry of bold , hand-written characters in classical Chinese reveals that ancestor Wang Yueyan was a high-ranking Song Dynasty official . <p> He was honored as a successful candidate in the highest imperial examination for Confucian scholars . <p> But around the year 1006 , Wang opposed the orders of a superior and was banished to a minor post in backward Guangdong . He settled in Huanglue , fathered a son , and founded the local Wang lineage . <p> Many strong patriarchal kinship groups like the Wangs emerged following a large migration to China 's southern frontier regions during the Song Dynasty . <p> Far from the dynastic struggles and imperial armies of the north , the self-regulating clans filled a power vacuum at the village level . They organized local militia , controlled marketplaces , and built up huge ancestral estates . By the 19th century , they owned almost 35 percent of the land in south China . Qing emperors and later the Nationalist regime of Chiang Kai-shek attempted to rein them in , but failed . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You had to obey them , " says Wang Bao , another member of the 26th generation , flashing a full set of gold teeth . " If you did something wrong , they would beat you in front of the ancestral hall . " <p> After the 1949 revolution , the Communist Party launched a campaign to eradicate kinship organizations through land reform and political persecution of clan elites . In Guangdong , the last province " liberated , " troops were ordered to enforce the land reform drive and compel reluctant peasants to denounce rich kinsmen . <p> Party vanguards moved into Huanglue , confiscating the property of ancestral trusts and converting the ancestral hall into a school . Kinship rites marking engagement , births , and other celebrations were outlawed , as were local opera performances that dramatized clan history . <p> " When Chairman Mao came , everything was considered feudal superstition , " Wang Bao says . <p> On the surface , it seemed the clan had disappeared by the late 1950s . But recent evidence indicates that many clans survived covertly . <p> Wang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worship at ancestral graves on qing ming . Wang Bangzhang buried the genealogy in a wooden box , saving it from the book-burning sprees of Mao 's radical Red Guards during the 1966-76 cultural revolution . <p> More important , according to Chinese historians , the establishment of collectives and " people 's communes " in the 1950s and ' 60s left intact the traditional Chinese village inhabited by relatives of the same name . Many villages simply became production teams . <p> Suppressed but not uprooted , clans began reviving with the dismantling of communes and establishment of individual , household-based farming under Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in the early 1980s . <p> Today , peasants turn to the network of relations to find jobs , establish contacts for inter-village trade , and gain a competitive edge in the market-oriented rural economy born with Mr. Deng 's reforms . Filling a void Lacking ancestral trusts , clansmen pool their individual savings . Some set up exclusive economic associations that compete with rivals for business , scholars say . <p> Many villages have also resurrected clan rites to fill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wangs donate money for ancestor worship , sacrifices to temple gods , and maintaining the geneology . This year , they renovated the ancestral hall and erected a stage for performing operas about famous Wangs . <p> Kinship groups use their influence to dominate the weddings , funerals and other rituals of members . Punishment for defying the clan can be severe , such as denying a member burial in the ancestral graveyard . Disobeying the state Perhaps most disconcerting to Chinese leaders , many village cadres indulge or encourage clans that break state decrees . <p> " Without opposition , local strongmen can spur on a multitude of clansmen to engage in all sorts of illegal activities , " writes Qian . <p> Clans ignore laws against building tombs on farmland . They forge alliances by betrothing children as young as eight , and hamper China 's single-child birth control policy , Chinese researchers say . <p> " Strong clans can persuade a woman to disregard family planning officials . This is a big problem for the government , " says Yang Zihui , a demographer at the Chinese Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by clans , the party tacitly respects their power and appeal among a traditional-minded peasantry . When party leaders in Zhanjiang learned of the approaching showdown in Mawen village last month , they immediately sent officials to Wang villages across the region to appeal to clan leaders to restrain their men . <p> " In each village we worked with the head of the clan . He has prestige and popular trust , " says Chen Fa , an official at the Zhanjiang Communist Party Committee , which administers the region . <p> The party also appears reluctant to discipline clans , even for blatant violations of law . <p> In Guangdong 's Wuchuan County , hundreds of Li kinsmen surrounded a police station , beating several officers in an act of clan revenge last year . But provincial press reports on the incident mentioned no punishment for the offenders . <p> Instead , party propagandists seek ways to link clan interests with those of the state . <p> For example , Marxist historians laud the patriotic exploits of Wang clansmen against French imperialists in the 1890s . According to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed with white spirits , grasped guns bought with ancestral money , and charged off to fight the French to the last man . <p> A plaque identifying 40 clansmen who died in the battle now graces the Wang 's ancestral hall in Huanglue . But Chinese scholars predict that it will take far more than propaganda , and probably only a long process of modernization could eradicate the millenium-old clans . <p> With the firecrackers of qing ming echoing across the fields , Wang Bao kneels down and kowtows before the tomb of the Song scholar-official . A light rain begins to fall on the tan and rose colored strips of paper anchored around the tomb with stones . <p> " Now the government has let loose , so we can worship again , " Wang laughs . " After all , everyone has ancestors ! "
