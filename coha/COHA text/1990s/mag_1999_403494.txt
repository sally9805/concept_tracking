FLOPPY DISKS ARE almost universally reviled for being too slow and too small , yet almost everyone depends on them for backing up individual files and sharing data among comput Headnote ers . But formatting floppies is a chore . You have to open Explorer , then navigate to the floppy drive , and choose the Format command from a menu . This is where a batch file can come in handy . // If you just want to format a disk , fire up Notepad and type format a : /autotest ( type b : instead of a : if that 's the drive you want to use ) . Save the file to a desired folder as something like fmt.bat , making sure to use the three-letter BAT extension . ( I keep a separate folder just for batch files . ) But be warned : The /autotest switch tells DOS to format a floppy disk without prompting you for confirmations . If you accidentally execute this batch file on a floppy containing data , use the DOS Unformat command to reverse the dire effects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x and DOS 6. x . If you use Windows gx , look for the file mirror.com ' on your hard disk . You may have to dig out your old DOS floppies and find a file called mirror.co ' ' . Start a DOS window ( choose Start.Programs.MSDOS Prompt ) , and at the C : prompt , type expand a : mirror.co c : dosmirror.com ( your path may differ ) , and then press &lt;Enter&gt; . Now open the fmt.bat file in Notepad and add the line c : dosmirror a : above the format line in Notepad . Mirror takes some space on the floppy , but it 'll let you recover data after an unintended format . Note that this batch file wo n't work with NT , nor will it allow for quick formatting . To overcome these limitations , change the format line to format a : /q &lt; c : windowscr.txt ( your path may be slightly different ) . If you 're not using NT , you can include the mirror line as before . Save and close the file . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command line ( here , it 's the Windows folder ) and choose New.Text Document . Name it cr.txt . Double-dick the new file to open it for editing . Press &lt;Enter&gt; twice to insert two carriage returns , then type N followed by &lt;Enter&gt; again . This will reply to the Format command 's prompts . Save the file , and exit . If you prefer to see the normal Windows Format dialog box ( Windows gx and NT only ) , right-click the Start button and click Open or Explore . Double-click Programs , then navigate to the folder from which you 'd like to launch the formatter . Rightclick an empty area and choose New . Shortcut . In the Command Line box , type rundll32.exe shell32.dll , SHFormatDrive , taking note of the lowercase/uppercase letters as shown ( see FIGURE 1 ) . Click Next and type a name for your shortcut ( like Floppy Formatter ) . Click Finish . If you want , you can assign a keyboard shortcut to launch this formatter : Right-click the new icon , select Properties , click the Shortcut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and type a letter or number . The system will automatically add Ctrl + Alt + ' to what you type , and that key combination will be your keyboard shortcut . Whenever you want to format a floppy , just choose your new command from the Start menu or press its keyboard shortcut . LOST IN DISK SPACE FILE MANAGEMENT often requires knowing how much space your files occupy and how much disk space you have left . Here are some quick takes on making assessments : Files only . Need to take stock of the number of files you have and the space they consume in a folder or drive ? You 'll need the status bar handy , so if it 's not visible , choose View.Status Bar ( in Explorer ) or Options.Status Bar ( in File Manager ) . If you 're running NT or Windows gx , make sure no files are selected to get a proper reading . To deselect all files , click an empty area of the folder ( see FIGURE 2 ) . Note that the status bar object count includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size listing does not count subfolders . Files and folders . To get a measure of the files , folders , and subfolders occupying a drive or older . do the following : In Windows 9x and NT , select the objects , rightclick on one , and choose Properties ( or press **25;2060;TOOLONG ) . ( If you care only about how many objects are in your selection , look at the status bar . ) In Windows 3. x , display a folder in File Manager , choose File.Search , and make sure *. * appears in the Search For box ( or change the file spec to analyze only a certain file type ) . Verify that Search All Subdirectories is selected and click OK . Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-/ to select all files in the Search Results window and choose File.Properties , or press **25;2087;TOOLONG to see the Properties box that lists the number of files and the space they occupy . // FIGURE 1 : // FIGURE 2 : // Free space . Often the question is n't how much space your files take up , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window ( the two-pane window in Windows 9x and NT ) or click the left pane of File Manager . Then , with the status bar visible , deselect all objects as explained earlier . Another option is to select a folder in the tree pane to make the status bar show , among other things , the free space available on that disk or partition . Graphic reminder .

Unfortunately , Windows plunks wallpaper files into the Windows folder , amid the million other files located there . In IE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for wallpaper files ( the WebWallpaper folder in your Windows folder ) . But if you already have your wallpaper files stored elsewhere , or for space reasons would prefer to keep them on another drive , you can designate a different folder for those image and HTML files . Prepare to fudge with the Windows Registry to do it , though . Here 's what to do : First , back up the following files in your Windows folder : user.dat , system.dat , user.dao , and system.dao . Next , choose Start-Run , type regedit , and press &lt;Enter&gt; to launch the Registry Editor . Travel down the folder tree in the left pane until you come to " **54;2114;TOOLONG ' ' . With the CurrentVersion folder selected in the left pane , look in the right pane for an icon labeled " WallPaperDir ' ' . Double-click it and edit the path in the " Value data " box to reflect your preferred wallpaper folder . Then click OK and exit the Registry Editor . To see the effect , just right-click the desktop and choose Properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallpapers you see should include all wallpaper-compatible files ( . bmp , . gif , . jpg , and . html ) in the Windows folder and in the folder you designated . And if you dick Browse , you 'll see the contents of the folder containing the currently selected file in the list . Happy decorating . SKIP THE FLOPPY BOOT CHECK AT BOOT-UP , Windows 98 checks to see if a floppy drive is present , which adds a few seconds to the process .
