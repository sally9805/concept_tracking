THE WARDEN ON SILVER STREET <p> Suppose you had been asked by your state to choose its Foster Parent of the Year . What kind of person would you find deserving of the title ? Would you scour foster homes looking for a woman with an apron tied around her waist welcoming her school-weary wards with warm chocolate chip cookies and steaming cocoa ? Would you search for a Harriet Nelson ? Or someone who reminded you of Beaver Cleaver 's mom ? <p> In 1992 , the Vermont Foster Parent Association undertook such a search . But its choice did n't resemble any 1950s sit-com mom . The laurel went to a woman with a rich laugh , a laugh that 's seen some living . She calls herself the Fat Grammy , but the local police have dubbed her THE WARDEN ON SILVER STREET <p> Janet Henry is that woman . She operates out of both sides of a seventeen-room duplex on Silver Street in Bennington , Vermont . In the eight bedrooms live Kris , the four-year-old grandson she is raising ; Jonathan , Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some boys , some girls ; and Henry herself . <p> Everyone eats breakfast together in one dining room , the students head off to school , and Henry , who works the night shift at a residential treatment center for boys , rests . The horde returns in midafternoon . In the evening , everyone sits down together for another meal . Through the interaction at meals , Henry is able to keep tabs on everyone and their activities . The duplex 's second dining room serves only as a pool hall ; Henry uses the pool table to get chores done . " I have my own stick . I used to play in pool tournaments , " she confides . The penalty for losing a game ? Vacuuming , maybe ; the dishes , perhaps . <p> The house rules number twenty-eight and take two full typed pages to explain . Rule number 1 : " All issues will be honestly and openly discussed ; therefore , lies will result in the loss of a night or nights out . " This is followed by " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a C level or higher ( with a reward of $3 per A and $1 per B ) , no swearing , in bed by 10 P.M. " And rule number 15 : " I am always available to talk , if you need help or just want to talk . This home is open to all subjects of discussion . " <p> Other rules provide the particulars that establish Henry 's bottom line : kids will be treated like responsible adults as long as they behave appropriately . The usual consequence for misbehavior is grounding , which means a loss of all privileges , having to be home within a half-hour of the end of school , and no phone calls in or out . <p> In more than twelve years , Henry has housed 152 adolescents . The stories she tells about life in the Janet Henry foster home abound in surprise , humor , and warmth . <p> Like Charlotte 's story . Find the August 31 , 1993 , copy of Globe ( a periodical usually snuggled up next to The National Inquirer at the grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll find the story and stunning photos of Charlotte Lopez , Miss Teen U.S.A. Charlotte was placed in foster care when she was three and routed through several homes before she spent ten years with one foster family . She moved into Janet Henry 's home as a young teen . <p> Henry remembers the girl was quiet and shy at first , " but now she is out , and I feel I contributed to that . " Charlotte 's dream was to model , or be in a beauty pageant . Each of Henry 's foster children may earn special TV-watching time . Whenever Charlotte had hours coming to her , she chose to watch " Star Search " or a beauty pageant . <p> Henry asked Charlotte if she truly wanted to be a pageant contestant . When the girl responded with a breathless , " Yes , " Henry encouraged her to apply for the Miss Vermont contest . The teen had to find sponsors willing to donate $595 ; Henry contributed the last $40 . When Charlotte won the Miss Vermont title in November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teen U.S.A. contest . <p> The Globe painted Charlotte 's Miss Teen U.S.A. crowning as a Cinderella story , but identified the real happy ending as Charlotte 's adoption . After years in the foster care system , sixteen-year-old Charlotte has found a permanent family . For Henry , Charlotte 's story is a personal victory for her as a foster mom , but she confesses that the triumph is bittersweet . <p> " It was hard letting Charlotte go ; the separation is painful . " At the same time , Henry is proud to have helped a young person realize a dream and better her life . And Henry is still Charlotte 's " pageant mom " ! Millions saw Henry on TV , jumping out of her chair for joy as Charlotte was crowned Miss Teen U.S.A. for 1993 . She also attended the ceremony during which Charlotte turned over her crown to the 1994 Miss Teen Vermont in October . Henry and Charlotte stay in touch by phone and still get together for dinner sometimes . <p> The media whirlwind generated by Charlotte 's story has swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-page article , Glamour magazine called Henry for a clarification of her house rules , TV talk shows have aired the story ( " Inside Edition " shot two hours of film in Henry 's home for one minute of air time ) , and Charlotte would like to portray herself in an upcoming made-for-TV movie . Henry has been bombarded with requests for interviews , but she will talk only to those who have Charlotte 's approval first and who will allow Henry to further the cause of the foster care system . <p> Other stories from Henry 's house have received less fanfare but are great successes in their own right . Ray arrived shy and quiet and angry . Before his stay with Henry ended , he was the junior varsity wrestling champ and president of the Youth Council for the state of Vermont . <p> Of course , not every tale is quite so happy . Henry recalls a phone call from the supervisor she 'd hired to stay with the kids while she worked her night shift . Two kids had run away in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl off the second story , and they left a trail of clothes . They stole a car sitting near the house  --  it was my daughter 's car  --  on Mother 's Day . On Mother 's Day yet ! " This part of her story she punctuates with a throaty laugh . <p> Henry labels only one experience from her history with foster children as really bad . One of her favorite girls stole her checkbook . The bank froze Henry 's account , and she had no money for thirty days . <p> So how does Henry handle those who break the rules ? Suppose someone does n't do the dishes . Maybe that someone flat out refuses with an , " I 'm not going to . " <p> Henry responds with an " Oh yes , you are . " If the chore was washing breakfast dishes , these wait in the sink . Meanwhile , those responsible for lunch and dinner dish duty are given a reprieve . Soon lunch and dinner dishes begin to stack up too . Henry takes the reluctant dishwasher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what you 've got to do here ? You 'll get tomorrow 's and the next day 's too . " The reluctance of the wayward dishwasher quickly gives way to panic at the sheer numbers of dirty plates and glasses . <p> " When they run away , I want them back . They owe me grounding time . " One of Henry 's girls , a thirteen-year-old , was kicked out of a school detention . Not wanting to pay the piper at the foster home , she ran away . Henry responded with a call to the police . Henry credits her success , in part , to her good working relationship with the local police . When the girl was caught , she had a choice : go back to Henry 's house and face the consequences of her action or go to a short-term lock-up facility . <p> Henry explains , again with her experienced laugh , that " lots of times , kids choose lock-up . They sit there for two to ten days , and then they call me , begging to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her foster children take their responsibilities seriously . If someone pushes it , Henry says , " We 'll push back . " Interestingly , she chooses to say " we , " not " I. " Henry works for the good of the entire household and expects her charges to do the same . <p> Henry 's strength , however , is in avoiding disasters . With six troubled teenagers living under one roof , the possibilities for conflict are great . If Henry feels the stress mounting , she only has to say , " I feel tension in the house . " Groans follow , because those who have lived with Henry for any length of time know what that simple statement means : family meeting . <p> Everything goes on hold . No night out , no dates , no telephone calls . The household members gather and the residents talk . The issue may take only fifteen minutes to uncover and resolve . It may take four hours . If the problem revolves around only two or three kids and they can not find a solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are getting along again must take place in front of Henry . Kids should not be out in the community , she believes , until they can prove their ability to coexist harmoniously with others . <p> Many foster children who have left Henry 's care stay in touch with her . " I tell them I 'm here ; I 'm always here . They call me from all over the country , collect . They call me with their joy , and they call me with their pain . " And some come back , sometimes with the families they have acquired , and sometimes Henry helps . <p> Despite all the love and support she gives them , Henry 's foster children never confuse her with their own mothers . And that 's the way Henry wants it . " I do n't have the kids call me Mom . I 'm Janet . First I 'm an authority ; then I 'm a friend . My goal for many of them is to reunite them with their biological parents . " <p> Henry feels strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can not return to their families due to physical abuse or other serious problems . Parents who struggle with the consequences of a poor economy , alcohol or drug abuse , or a lack of coping skills also deposit their children in foster care . The system 's seams have burst . Henry 's answer is for parents as well as their children to receive counseling and support . She believes that if the biological parents can be helped to deal with problems in their homes while keeping their own children , the strain on the foster system will ease . Henry 's work for such change within the foster care system helped earn her the Foster Parent of the Year award . Letters of recommendation told how closely she worked with biological families . <p> At first , parents of children in foster care are angry , and they are afraid . Henry works to ease both those damaging emotions . When children are first placed in her home , Henry contacts the parents to educate them about the system . She explains that three hearings will follow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ought to hire an attorney , and that the parents have to trust the social worker , the courts , and Henry . She explains further that she is n't interested in stealing their child and that she will do everything in her power to reunite the family . <p> Henry invites the parents into her home so they may meet her and see their child 's room . She encourages them to bring the child 's favorite things . Henry 's goal is to befriend the parents , because together , she believes , they can all make positive changes . Often she will mediate during meetings between parents and a child , helping them to understand one another . Henry 's work pays off . " I have a very high rate of unmanageable ' kids returning to their parents , " she says . <p> Sometimes local parents who are not at all connected to the foster care system call Henry privately and ask her to take their kids for a week to straighten them out . And she does . " I 'm really tough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying to come home . " <p> In addition to working with their families , Henry actively attempts to empower all of her placement children . They learn something from her to take with them in life . To illustrate the point , Henry tells the story of a teenage girl who came to her from a mother who was mentally ill . The mom was a shoplifter . The teen stayed with Henry for a while and then returned home . When the reunited mother and daughter were out shopping one day , the mom started to shoplift . The girl told her , " You put that back . You 're not allowed to shoplift when you 're with me . " <p> Sometimes when the system for which Janet Henry works presents a wall , she finds a route to circumvent it . Herein lies the story of Henry 's duplex . Because of licensing rules and regulations , Henry could not put an eighteen-year-old ( legally an adult ) in a room with a child fourteen , fifteen , or sixteen years old . Consequently , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave foster care on that birthday . " What is it about the number eighteen ? " she demands . " Getting kicked out  --  what a birthday present ! " <p> Henry first tried putting one of her first eighteen-year-olds in the attic , but that got her into trouble with the local foster care parent office . She and her extended family occupied only half of a duplex at that time . Fortuitously , the other half became available , and Henry took it . <p> Henry 's eighteen-year-olds now live in that other half . The system still supports those who are enrolled in school . So some stay for a month or two until they graduate . If past foster children return , occasionally with a family , and need a place to stay for a while , they can also live in that other half of the duplex . Occasionally , other adolescent centers in Vermont need to find temporary placement for their teens . Because of Henry 's work in the adolescent treatment field , she is known as a haven for their patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation  --  until the assigned center reopens . <p> Henry has also been experimenting  --  successfully  --  with an independent living program . If an older foster child has lived with Henry for ninety days or more , is alcohol- and drug-free , works with a transitional coordinator ( a counselor who helps older kids establish goals , banking skills , and other practical living skills ) , and has independent living as part of the case plan , that young person may live next door while preparing to eventually move to private housing . <p> In the three years of this experiment , Henry has placed six foster children in apartments . Like a regular parent , she 's helped with furniture , bought some dishes , and essentially made the kids ' dreams of being on their own come true . " After conforming to everybody 's rules , they deserve the help , " says Henry . <p> " Foster parenting is the most rewarding , significant thing I 've done in my life . I have joy and happiness on a daily basis , " Henry says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well with troubled adolescents is that she was one herself . <p> Henry 's life experiences have prepared her for almost every problem that she sees . She knows who is stoned and who is not . She knows , from the residual odor on clothing , whether sinsemilla or Colombian red was the culprit . She knows who 's been battered , who 's depressed , who 's cross-addicted . <p> Henry 's own troubles started when she was twelve and a beloved grandmother died . With this devastating loss , by her own admission , she " turned into a monster . " She became truant from school , fought with her parents , beat up her younger sister . By the time she was fourteen , she found herself in a Catholic girls reformatory . She laughs when explaining , " In those days , when you got into trouble , they sent you to the nuns . " <p> The place was basically a jail for unmanageables . Accusing her of sexual promiscuity , " the nuns conducted a physical exam that actually took my virginity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was repeatedly told , " Once a bad girl , always a bad girl ; you 'll end up in jail , for sure . " <p> At fifteen , back with her parents , Henry found herself pregnant and unwed . <p> When she was sixteen , her first-born arrived . Henry 's parents took over raising him when , at seventeen , Henry left home again and wandered to Reading , Pennsylvania . There she worked as a club hostess by night , a gift wrapper by day . Over the next two years Henry managed a bar , modeled lingerie for a department store , and married a GI , leaving him after only three days . She describes herself then as " still in that explosive , adolescent frame of mind . " <p> A USO tour with Bob Hope followed . Afterwards , Henry moved on to Boston , where she became a go-go girl , complete with white boots . At twenty-two , Henry married again . She had a daughter at twenty-three , but the young couple 's financial difficulties sent Henry back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult returning to the clubs because she was twenty pounds heavier . " I laugh about it now . I was all of 130 pounds then , but my boss noticed those twenty extra pounds . I was making twenty dollars more a night , so I told him I was charging a dollar a pound more . " After earning enough money to get through that winter , she gave up her go-go days permanently . <p> Two years later , with a second daughter , abuse from her husband , and another twenty pounds , her marriage soured . Her husband , a long-distance trucker , moved Henry and the girls to the Midwest so that he could visit coming and going between the East and West coasts . Manchester , Iowa , " where there was nothing but cornfields , " isolated Henry from family and friends . " I had a nervous breakdown . I had two beautiful baby girls , and all I wanted to do was die . So I committed myself to the psychiatric unit for six weeks . " <p> During those weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her doctors pointed out that she was allowing herself to be battered . <p> Henry decided to rebuild her life and knew that she had to start by ending her marriage . " I was twenty-nine when I got divorced , and because of that , twenty-nine is my favorite number . It was my stepping-stone to life . " <p> Between the ages of fifteen and thirty-two , Henry was " drinking and drugging . " She defines herself as a cross-addicted alcoholic , but proudly adds that she has been sober since 1976 . After her divorce , she started working on her substance abuse . <p> Henry took the two girls and returned to Vermont . One morning Henry sent her daughters off to school . As they walked to class , her ex-husband picked them up in his car and spirited them back to Iowa . <p> She had to fight through the courts to get her children back . The girls ' father charged that Henry was unfit . Henry was three months pregnant at the time with another man 's baby , and her ex-husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as proof of her inability to raise their daughters . The local Department of Social Rehabilitation Services ( SRS ) was ordered by Iowa to do a home study on Henry . <p> A representative from the SRS inspected Henry 's home and questioned her neighbors and friends . If she had dated a man more than three times , he was interviewed . The woman who conducted the home study concluded that Henry was a good person , a wonderful mother . <p> With this report in hand , Henry traveled to Iowa and returned with her children . <p> The woman who had performed Henry 's home study , Marge Sumner , the resource coordinator of SRS , had also suggested that when Henry was ready to go to work , she should contact the SRS department and see what might be available . Sumner recruited her into the foster parent program . " She made me feel like a valuable human being , " Henry says of Sumner . " She thought I was a good mother , and that was a significant thing for me . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit enough to help with their children . " <p> In 1982 , Henry became licensed for one foster child . The square footage of her house and the number of beds available dictated the number of children she was allowed . Henry wanted a teenager . After years of abuse , older children will " find a way to safety , " she says , and Henry wanted to provide that safety . <p> In 1983 , Henry  --  a high school dropout  --  enrolled in Southern Vermont College , a private school in Bennington , to earn a college degree . She walked a couple of miles to campus , " the Shoe Leather Express , " as she calls it . Within five years , Henry had completed a bachelor of science degree of her own design , a dual major of criminal justice and human services . <p> While in school , Henry was co-editor of the college newsletter , The Chatterbox . " Still rebelling against authority , " her campaign to distribute free condoms on campus earned her the nickname " Mother Condom . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and AIDS awareness . But she pressed her luck when she gave the dean 's secretary condoms to dispense . The dean immediately called Henry into his office . Henry told him that it was really his job to provide students with condoms , that he should be promoting safe sex  --  and she refused to discuss it any further . <p> As her foster license expanded , Henry took two , then four , then five , and eventually six teens in under her care . Then in 1989 , Henry took what she calls her " first real job , " one she continues to hold , as a counselor in a residential adolescent treatment center for boys ranging from thirteen to eighteen years of age . <p> Henry says that her large body is " an asset . I use it as much as possible . The boys call me Fat Grammy , and I love it . If I think there is going to be a physical confrontation with a boy at the treatment center or a foster kid , I say , How are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fat grammy ? What if you miss ? And are you sure you can put this fat grammy down ? This could be very embarrassing for you . ' " <p> More than its usefulness , Henry sees her size as part of herself . " I do n't even think about dieting . I 'm the Fat Grammy . Who would want a skinny , bony grammy ? " This is also the woman who tells people she 's fifty-seven , so they 'll say she looks great . ( She 's only forty-eight . ) <p> Henry snowshoes in the winter and runs in warmer weather . The running started when her son Jonathan was a Little League player and Henry became a Little League mom . One of the dads was running with his son as a warm-up , and the body told Jonathan that his mom was too fat to run . Jonathan 's feelings were hurt . So , Henry explains , " While that brat was laughing , I asked the coach if he would like me to run the boys around the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ignoring the unspoken but obviously derisive answer , Henry took the boys around for a few laps . Some outdistanced her at first , but she reports finishing with the pack . <p> That inauspicious start led to road races . Her boys , who were part of her motivation  --  she needed something she could do with the boys  --  worried that she would get hurt . Their fears could n't stop her , even though their first time out , she finished dead last . <p> Then , one Father 's Day , Jonathan and a few foster sons traveled with Henry to run a race in New York . Henry laughs and says , " There I was , the fat grammy , running a road race with all these jock fathers . I was the only one to bring a trophy back for the state of Vermont . When they called out the winners , I heard my name . I wondered why , and then I discovered I 'd won third in my age category ! " <p> In addition to age categories , some races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry was placed in the Clydesdale Division , for runners weighing 195 pounds or more . She was the only woman in that division . The organizers of the race said they did n't expect a woman in the category . Henry responded , " Well , you got one . Now , where 's my trophy ? " <p> " Weight is not the issue , " insists Henry . " How much you weigh does not make you happy or unhappy . I was my most unhappy , my most depressed , when I was star-model thin . I 'm happy now because I love myself . To get love , to give love , you must first love and respect yourself . " <p> Part of loving yourself involves taking care of yourself . Janet Henry knows that to keep her sanity , she needs to indulge herself occasionally . She takes two weeks of vacation a year , one week in the summer and one in winter . And every other month , she visits the West Mountain Inn in Arlington , Vermont , for a weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejuvenate her . The proprietors of the inn nurture her in the way Henry nurtures the people in her life . <p> Henry needs to keep herself in good working order . In addition to everything else that fills her days , Henry is working to promote her notion of how the foster system should operate . Henry has identified a pool of untapped foster parents : single welfare mothers . She says this group has been kept from fostering because " a single woman is not the traditional family of Mom and Dad in a white house with a picket fence . Well , this is not the reality of needy kids ' lives . They do n't come from that , and they are not going back to that . " If she can convince foster care system coordinators and recruiters to take advantage of this rich resource , the availability of foster homes will grow . <p> Henry is also working to promote FAST ( Foster Parents Allegation Support Team ) , an organization to assist foster parents when they are accused of doing something wrong in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inevitable part of working with troubled children . This team should help keep the system from losing good foster parents , who often close down their homes under the stress of such accusations . <p> Not to be forgotten , too , is Henry 's involvement in helping battered women and with Parents Anonymous , a group dedicated to assisting parents develop appropriate responses when angered . <p> Henry is happy with her full schedule . " I 'm really enjoying my life now . I 'm just like these adolescents I live with : eager to make changes and a little rebellious . So we get along well . They ask me , When are you going to grow up ? ' I say , Never , I hope . Never . ' I like me just the way I am now . " <p> And so the Warden or , if you prefer , the Fat Grammy , stages for her foster children , her children , and her grandchildren , the never-ending story of how " bad girls " do n't have to stay bad ; how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how all the stumbling blocks of life can serve to ripen a laugh that will see you through whatever comes next . <p> Article copyright Radiance . <p> Article copyright Radiance . <p> Photo ( Janet with Charlotte Lopez ) <p>
