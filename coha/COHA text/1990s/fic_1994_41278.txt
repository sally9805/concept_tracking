A WEEK and a half later announcing her engagement , my best friend , Kathleen , brought Kyle over to meet us . At this time we still knew only one thing about him : he worked at Knott 's Berry Farm . My husband , Mark , was pessimistic about it , because he thinks there 's almost no chance an unmarried woman  --  divorced , in this case  --  who 's past the age of twenty-two can meet a decent man . Inevitably she 'll marry the other kind , and spend the rest of her life covering it up . So we wo n't know . <p> He was putting out glasses and ice and dip , all fixed that tidy way I 'd found so jarring when we were first together . He wants to put everything in arrangements . I could never reconcile it with his love of smoking dope . This is a man from a really bohemian family  --  they 'll tell you they had a cousin who was almost blacklisted before you even get through the front door ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noses , such as , for example , Kyle may make  --  but I do mean celery sticks all arranged in a row according to their size and their color . Speaking of Kyle , by the way , Mark claimed he wears shirts with flapping short sleeves , and goes out and buys a new snowblower every two years . He could n't possibly know this ! Also , with no evidence whatsoever , he harped on what he called " the main disappointment of Kyle 's life  --  that rejection by Mensa . " <p> " Kathleen will probably want to stay after he 's gone home , " he was saying . <p> " Why ? " <p> I said " Why ? " but was at that moment reading his mind . He imagined she would be so embarrassed by Kyle all evening that we 'd have to have an hour with just the three of us , to make sure she understood . we did n't think any less of her Of course she was bound to make an occasional mistake in her desperate rush to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desire of any woman he happens to think well of , and in fairness to him I will admit that all women think he is " adorable , " and something about him makes them feel they can and should tell him so . <p> I threw up my hands . " You know he may be great ! He may be perfect for her ! " <p> " Yeah , " he muttered in his preoccupied way over the celery . " We should try to keep an open mind . But she 's always so lonely , and she 's so good-natured  --  you just never know what kind of creep she 'll drag in . " <p> The doorbell rang at that second , as if to say , " I ' 11 show you what kind ! " It was twice as eerie since Kathleen always comes through the back door . <p> " Does n't want Kyle to know about the back door , " Mark said on his way past me ; " I think she 's regretting the whole business already . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hair looked all right , and when I joined them they were standing staring up at an old brass sconce with a worn shade , as if it were a mysterious deity . <p> First I hugged Kathleen while she said , " Another one of your cheerful black outfits ! " Then Kyle and I shook hands . <p> " I was just admiring your light fixture ! " he said . <p> I was n't about to laugh  --  well , that 's not exactly true  --  so I said , " Oh , are you a ... a sconce enthusiast ? " <p> KATHLEEN rolled her eyes at me . She was amused , though . Meanwhile , Mark was staring beadily at Kyle , who had an oval bald head . He was a normal-looking man  --  he looked somewhat like David Gergen . <p> Murmuring something , Mark lifted Kathleen 's raincoat up off her shoulders , so I reached out for Kyle 's . <p> He handed it over , and I took it back to the vestibule and slid it onto a hanger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fantastic house ! " I heard him exclaim as I joined them in the living room . " It really makes one think of the gracious old days , does n't it , when they had plenty of servants and knew just how to live ! " <p> " Thanks , " I replied , seating myself next to him . The other two were on the couch facing us . Kathleen seemed happy , and Mark , I guessed , was going over in his mind what might be the best way to console her . <p> " Kathleen got lost coming back from the airport ! " Mark said to me . <p> " I did , " she said , shaking her head . " It 's the fifth time I 've forgotten the name of my own exit . " <p> " It 's Ridgefield , " Mark said . <p> " I know it now , " she said . " I ' 11 know it next time . You know , I thought it was that , but it seemed so obvious that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , but it 's so obvious , it ca n't be . ' That 's how these things always happen to me . " " Your hair looks great , and that 's the main thing , " I said . <p> " Does n't she have fantastic hair ? " Kyle said . " That hair and that figure ! " Kyle pretended to have an attack of the shivers . " Boy , the guy who could walk out on that ! " <p> He 'd called Kathleen " that . " I could n't help glancing over at Mark . He 'd been gazing at her knee , perhaps musing on the terrible odds she faced , but now he sat up straight , as if he 'd been punched in the stomach . I looked away , wondering if someday there 'd be some horrible repercussion for Kyle . <p> Kathleen herself did n't seem bothered and only remarked that there 's no accounting for people 's tastes . And to really understand that , you have to know she mistakenly believes she has very mediocre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for the billionth time . Then we all chewed awhile on the celery . Kathleen eventually returned to the subject of the exit names , which she thinks are being changed all the time . <p> I said to Kyle , " I understand you work at Knott 's Berry Farm , " and he said , " Ah ! " as if I were just about to win a grand prize . <p> " Yes , I manage the Good Time Theatre there at Knott 's Berry Farm . " He paused to swallow . " Do you know it ? No ? Kind of interesting how it happened . I took a job there in 1981 , just to tide me over till the grad-school semester started . Guess what ? I never made it to grad school ! " <p> " Why not ? " Mark said . <p> Kyle turned three quarters toward me and , slightly chewing , said that it was the only " family-type facility on the West Coast " that does something  --  ca n't remember , I guess , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might be some kind of code for religious views  --  and then he concluded , " I guess I 'm pretty proud of it , the way I go on ! " <p> And then I came down on him for being ashamed of being proud of Knott 's Berry Farm , because I am such a snob and I did n't want him to think he could read my mind . ( And I 'd been thinking , " Boy , you sure are proud of Knott 's Berry Farm . " ) I pretty much said to him , " I may not like your shirt or anything , and I think you 're boring , but by God , I 'm no monster . " <p> I caught Kathleen gazing at me , but it lasted only seven milliseconds . <p> So then I felt so guilty that I really threw negativity to the winds and said , in an encouraging voice , " Are you going to <p> take Kathleen out there to see it ? " " Oh , nothing would please me more ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm . I said nothing would please me more ! " <p> He really looked like David Gergen in a happy mood as he reached over the credit 's and put his hand on her knee for a moment . He sure seemed to be crazy about her , and from her way of smiling back  --  ooh , I ca n't say it . But I was filled with forebodings . Because , other than looking like David Gergen , he did n't seem like a real person to me . That 's going to have to be my excuse . <p> " Want to come out and help me carry in things Mark already made ? " I said to Kathleen . <p> " Now , that 's a skill I 'm going to need , " she replied with a laugh . " Kyle 's such a great cook ! " <p> " Great ! " I said , my heart still sinking , sinking down into my shoes . Clown faces made with olives . It seemed more plausible than ever ! But you know what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the truth was so much worse . <p> GETTING out to the kitchen , we found Mark 's brother Carl standing there dripping rain on the floor . He must have come in through the back door , heard guests , and stood there wondering what to do , as he is very unsociable . It just so happens he has a crush on Kathleen , but that did n't keep him from neglecting to say hello to her or to me . <p> " I came to get that manual Mark borrowed from me . " <p> " Oh , I think he 's still reading it . Mark ! " <p> " I ca n't help that . I need it back . " <p> " Carl 's here , Mark ! " I yelled again , and then turned back . <p> " Where 's Carla ? " ( That 's Carl 's wife ! ) <p> " In the car . " <p> " How 's she been ? " Kathleen said . All the rest of the people in the world have stopped asking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreads out and engulfs time and space , just like the Blob . <p> " She has n't any feeling in her left foot , " Carl replied punitively . " None . " Then he added , " People who are healthy all the time ca n't imagine what it means to be in a situation like Carla 's . " <p> That 's Carl 's way of saying to Kathleen , " I want your body , damn it . " <p> But she actually managed a sympathetic response , and was even asking what the doctor thought it was , when Mark entered with the book . " Word something something User 's Guide ... is this it ? " <p> " Yes ! " Carl said churlishly . " I 'm going to need it myself from now on . " <p> " Fine . Well , Kathleen 's brought someone over , so we 'd better all get back in there . " He started and then turned back to his brother . " Or you can stay and have a drink if you want ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . They do n't make it anymore . " <p> " Moxie ! I remember that ! " Kathleen said suddenly , a faraway look in her eyes . I picked up the next relay of crackers : spirals all laid out perfectly in advance ( not by me ) . <p> These things that happen between Mark and Carl are unpleasant , and often about Moxie , absurd as that is , because as a young teenager , before he knew he was going to be a famous psycholinguist , Carl used to drink it , thinking it was alcohol and that he was getting drunk . He would actually go downtown and stagger around ! <p> I turned back to get Kathleen to come . I no longer wanted to trap her in the kitchen and force her to explain Kyle to me . Right then I felt there was enough unpleasantness in the world ! Of course , I did still feel an unspeakable dread on her behalf , connected with Kyle . I also had to face the fact that she did n't seem curious about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the sink . " Moxie ! Something about Moxie ! Was n't it almost black ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I said with a sigh . " It was a weird drink that made a big impression on everybody . I 'm sorry Carl was rude . I 'm sorry about it . You know the reason  --  the main reason , anyway . " She laughed and said she realized that he was always mad about something or other . And suddenly I could feel it coming that she was about to say , " That 's why I like Kyle so much ! " <p> " That 's what I appreciate about Kyle . You know , Trish , I 've always picked the most demanding guys , and always felt it was up to me to soothe them , for some reason . I did n't even realize I was doing it . Till I met Kyle . You think he 's too much the other way , do n't you ? Never mind . I could tell you did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unexpected feelings of shame invaded my being . I put down the tray . I said , " I did n't know him yet then . " <p> She shook her head and started gazing out the window again . <p> " I just have the feeling I 'm really not going to ever get married again . " <p> " Course you will ! " <p> " Ladies ! " Mark exclaimed from the living room . " How ' bout those crackers ! Not touching the arrangement , are you ? " <p> " No , I wo n't , " she continued . " You do n't like him , and "  --  she laughed  --  " I just could n't stand the strain of it ! " <p> At that moment a smiling Mark reappeared beside us and whispered , " We were over looking at that sconce again and we heard every word you said about Kyle . Just so you know ! " <p> We rushed back into the living room . Kathleen gave a hug to the ever-cheerful Kyle and led him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us about a project he was planning . I supposed it was some kind of new ride at " the farm , " or a new " Las Vegas-type show , " and I begged him to tell about it too , while simultaneously shoving the tray at him . I was ready to do practically anything to get him distracted from what he might have overheard . I wonder I did n't sit down on the other side of him from Kathleen and try to get him engaged to me , as well ! ( I know what he would have said , too : " Hey , are n't you married to Mike ? " ) <p> He did n't want to discuss the project after all , though , because , he said , it would probably come to nothing . <p> " It 's a book , " Kathleen said . " He 's an excellent writer . " <p> " A book you 're planning to write ? " Mark said . <p> " I guess it sounds strange , after all that about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's true . At least it 's something I think I 'd enjoy trying . " <p> " Kyle grew up in Michigan , and it would be a book all about Lake Huron , its history  --  economic history , mainly . And how neglected it 's always been by the rest of the country . His father was a newspaper editor n a small town , so Kyle saw better than most people how it all happened . " <p> " Amazing how we never even think about Lake Huron ! " I said , still feeling a lot of guilt and anxiety . <p> " Huron : The Quiet One , " Mark said in a dreamy voice . <p> " There 's a lot of people hurting up there , " Kyle remarked . <p> " How about a new Knott 's Berry Farm for the place ? " Mark said . <p> " Ha ! I wish ! " <p> " Would you take a leave of absence to write it ? " I said in a riveted voice . <p> Kathleen said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gee , I was ready to extend all kinds of privileges , too ! " <p> I was groaning on the inside . Groaning ! But on the outside we all laughed . I was looking at Kyle 's bitten-down fingernails , but I was seeing the future . A monstrous foursome . Soon our names would be appearing in an article headed " KNOT 'S BERRY FARM NUPTIALS . " Yes ! And then Kyle , the opportunist twerp , would be turning his back on " the farm " and family values to move in with my friend , probably expecting her to buy him a word processor ! Of course it had to happen that way . No way he 'd let her move and give up her little firm that brought in so much money ! Maybe he himself was a con man who 'd never actually worked one day . He was probably from Lubbock , Texas , or something . <p> The snowblowing , family-values man with the flapping short sleeves now receded to a tiny point , while Kyle himself came rushing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand ! At that moment Mark interrupted to say , " Macaroni and cheese ready , dear ? " <p> That was a code , because we do n't like the dish . <p> " Yes , " I said , trying to gather my wits without showing how upset I felt . " I think dinner is ready , as a matter of fact . " <p> " Let me help carry things ! " said our male guest . <p> Kathleen walked out beside me , telling me about her friend Ruthie who had had a nose job , claiming it was an operation for a sinus problem . " And when her friends see her , she 'll have to say something like ' My nose feels so much better it actually looks better ! Is n't that weird ? " <p> " But they wo n't think it looks better , because they think she just had regular surgery , do n't you think ? " I replied . I was interested , but also crushed by something else at the same time , so I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I looked at my hands in my lap . Kathleen was saying it was a subtle kind of change , they pulled in the nostrils a little bit , and I was listening but I was having a hard time . I was trying to bear a picture of my own future , when Kathleen would be all wrapped up in her own life , and I 'd be the sole companion of Mark . <p>
