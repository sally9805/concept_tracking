<p> WALKING back to his office at the Grays Harbor Paper Company after showing a visitor around , manager John McDonald is a lonely figure . He 's the only person in sight at a mill that bustled with activity for more than 60 years , the last one left who heard the rumble of the now-silent machines and smelled the distinctive sulfurous odor only a papermaker can love . <p> This is the story around much of the Pacific Northwest , which has seen more than 100 mills shut down over the past decade . And it is the reason why so many people here are looking to President Clinton to solve the problem with his promised " timber summit . " <p> To see the complexity and especially the human side of trying to balance environment and economy , the Clinton administration would do well to visit Grays Harbor on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State . Here , a timber-dependent community already hard-hit by recession has just seen one of its major employers shut down . <p> Among the reasons why people like John McDonald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a declining supply of wood fiber to make paper , due to environmental restrictions on logging in this area . Limitations are designed to protect the threatened northern spotted owl 's habitat . <p> When the ITT Rayonier Pulp Mill and the Grays Harbor Paper Company mill - owned by ITT Rayonier Inc. and the International Paper Company - closed their doors last November , 626 jobs were lost . Unemployment already was above 14 percent in this county of 65,100 people , a figure Hoquiam Mayor Phyllis Shrauger " fully expects " to pass 20 percent now that 60 days of layoff pay required under federal law have run out and workers are unemployed . <p> Beyond the immediate layoffs , which amount to $ 30 million in annual pay and benefits losses , the economic impact is spreading to other businesses as well . <p> Across the street from City Hall , Al McLeod 's small print shop used to do about half its business with the mill . " That was a big account , " he says , " so it 's been pretty rough not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " Of his five employees , one has been let go , and the others are putting in less than half their normal hours . The " multiplier effect " of the mills ' shutdown could put as many as 1,200 more out of work . <p> The town of Hoquiam ( whose Quinalt Indian name , ironically , means " hungry for wood " ) was getting 25 percent of its municipal income from business taxes on the mills . " That paid for the policemen , the firemen , the libraries , the swimming pool , " said Mayor Shrauger , who taught in the public schools here for 27 years . In all , the pulp and paper mills provided $ 2 million a year in state and local taxes . <p> A visitor to Hoquiam and the neighboring town of Aberdeen does not see immediate evidence of economic hard times , although the " This Family Supported By Timber Dollars " signs in windows of modest homes are poignant . Log trucks still rumble through the towns every few minutes . ( They carry mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal forests , but they are from private land . ) <p> Beneath the surface , however , there is trouble , due to the layoffs and consequent uncertainty for families here for generations . Tough transition <p> " It 's been tough , " says John Hughes , Aberdeen Daily World newspaper editor , who went to high school with many now-unemployed millworkers . " The guys on Grays Harbor have traditionally been blue-collar , hard-working , plain-spoken , breadwinner people . There 's a lot of middle-age crises out there for guys whose father and Uncle Joe also worked at the mill and they never thought it would end . It may be particularly hard on wives . " <p> " We 've seen significant increases in family violence , chemical dependency , adjustment problems , and marital discord , " says Joe Mazzara , a mental-health coordinator at the Evergreen Counseling Center , a private , nonprofit group . " And we anticipate seeing even more problems as the benefits run out in June or July . " Although some longtime mill employees will get a year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay - the average is about six months . <p> " I 've spent a lot of sleepless nights worrying about what 's going to happen , " said Walter Brown , a journeyman pipe fitter . " You work with these people for 14 years and it becomes like a family . I 'm going to miss them . " <p> A well-known figure in the county is Jim Coates , a former millwright electrician and union official now working for the state government " timber team " to help unemployed workers and their families . One state official calls Mr. Coates " a combination of Attila the Hun and Mother Teresa " for his ability to pressure bureaucrats and private social-service agencies for help for those in need . <p> Standing outside the abandoned United States Fish and Wildlife Service warehouse that he badgered federal officials into providing for storage of donated food , Coates ticks off some numbers : 42,000 pounds of canned hatchery fish - acquired through a " glitch " in state law ; 76 percent of all county children receiving government meal assistance at school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 percent of enrollees at the local community college on federal student aid ; 730,000 pounds of food distributed in 1992 , 950 cords of firewood ... <p> Coates has a tough exterior and a weary look , but it 's not logs or canned-food inventories that gnaw at him . " It 's really a heartbreaker when you drive up and the kids are waiting on the porch wrapped in blankets because they have n't had heat in seven or eight days , " he says . " Nobody should have to live like that . " <p> " Everybody focuses on the mill closure , but they do n't realize that the total job loss has been six times that great , " he says , referring to the other jobs that have been lost on the Olympic Peninsula in the past few years . In the five-county area , there are more than 3,000 dislocated timber workers , says Mike Kennedy , who runs a regional government program to help such workers . " And those are the ones we can count . " <p> Although there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national forests , there is also considerable effort to provide support for laid-off workers . ITT Rayonier gave $ 2 million for outplacement , job training , and counseling . The federal government put up $ 2.25 million , in addition to an earlier $ 2.75 million for plant closures in the area . Within a week of the recent plant closing , 80 workers had enrolled for the winter quarter at Grays Harbor Community College . About 100 quickly entered a state-supported program called " New Chance " to upgrade basic skills in math and English . <p> " We 're off to a fast start , " said John Loyle of the Pacific Mountain Private Industry Council , which is helping run the temporary reemployment center at an old ITT Rayonier building in downtown Hoquiam . <p> Dislocated timber workers are among the most-valued outreach counselors . Charles Hargett , who worked in the paper mill for 30 years , has helped counsel many of the 300 workers seeking help here . <p> " I think it 's been a comfort to them to have somebody they can talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " When they say they 've got that ache in the gut , I know what they 're talking about . " Caring counselors <p> " These people care and they 're positive , which is a big plus , " says Mr. Brown , just after huddling with Mr. Hargett in the busy reemployment center . Brown has decided to go back to school and study environmental technology . <p> " I see it as a booming industry , and it 's exciting to get into something new , " he says . He is a bit apprehensive about school , however . " I 'm always on my kids to get better grades in high school , and now I 'm going to have to perform . " <p> The plant had been losing $ 1 million a month due to the high cost of pulpwood and low prices for paper products . The corporations were unsuccessful in their attempts to find a buyer , but a coalition of local business and labor leaders now hopes to form an employee stock-ownership program and attract a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " HarborMill " and hired a consultant to produce a financial analysis and business plan . They are offering a " strike-free " environment , according to a corporation statement , and union representatives have agreed to " some reductions from the previous wage and benefit levels . " All parties have affirmed that " the top priorities are customer satisfaction , quality , and never-ending improvement . " <p> " We 're looking for a new paradigm in labor relations , " said Ernest Hensley , executive director of the Grays Harbor Economic Development Council . Still , most see this plan as a long shot , particularly since it is likely to take millions of dollars in modifications to make the mill competitive . <p> " We 've had some very interesting nibbles , " says paper chemist Bob Martin , who worked here for 17 years and now chairs the HarborMill corporation . " But it 's a long way from a nibble to a full strike and having it flop around in the boat . " While the companies are in no hurry to unload their equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign sources the sale of valuable items like the two paper machines . <p> There is talk of drawing more tourists to an area that is physically beautiful , although tourism jobs rarely pay what millworkers have been earning - an average of $ 37,000 a year . Meanwhile , local leaders are working hard to attract new industries . There have been a few small successes here , but there are big things holding the area back : an hour 's distance to an interstate highway , even farther to an international airport , a lack of warehouse and industrial space . <p> " It 's going to be a rough two years , " Shrauger says , " But in the long run , I think we 'll be better off because we 'll be forced to diversify . " <p> The timber summit to be convened this spring will be the first chance for the Clinton team to prove its campaign assertion that environmental and economic well-being do not have to be at odds . <p> " If Clinton and Gore can bring everybody to the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bless them , " the mayor says . " I really do hope and pray that they are successful . "
