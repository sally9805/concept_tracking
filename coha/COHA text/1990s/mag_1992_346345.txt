TITLE : STEPHEN HAWKING : A LIFE IN SCIENCE <P> AUTHORS : MICHAEL WHITE AND JOHN GRIBBIN <P> PUBLISHER : DUTTON ; 304 PAGES ; $23 <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : He is bound to a wheelchair , but his mind explores the universe . <P> He is almost totally paralyzed , speechless and wheelchair-bound , able to move only his facial muscles and two fingers on his left hand . He can not dress or feed himself , and he needs round-the-clock nursing care . He can communicate only through a voice synthesizer , which he operates by laboriously tapping out words on the computer attached to his motorized chair . Yet at age 50 , despite these crushing adversities , Stephen Hawking has become , in the words of science writers Michael White and John Gribbin , " perhaps the greatest physicist of our time . " His 1988 book , A Brief History of Time , has sold 1.7 million copies around the world . <P> Hawking 's choice of career was most fortunate , for himself as well as for science . Rejecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose instead to concentrate on math and theoretical physics , first at Oxford and then at Cambridge . But at age 21 he developed the first symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS )  --  also known as Lou Gehrig 's disease  --  a disorder that would inevitably render him paralyzed and incapable of performing most kinds of work . As the authors note , theoretical physics was " one of the very few jobs for which his mind was the only real tool he needed . " <P> He has used that tool with consummate skill . While still a graduate student , Hawking became fascinated by black holes , the bizarre objects created during the death throes of large stars . Working with mathematician Roger Penrose and using Einstein 's relativity equations , he developed new techniques proving mathematically that at the heart of black holes were singularities  --  infinitely dense , dimensionless points with irresistible gravity . He went on to demonstrate that the entire universe could have sprung from a singularity and , in his 1966 Ph.D . thesis , wryly noted that " there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fellow at Cambridge , Hawking calculated that the Big Bang , which gave birth to the universe , must have created tiny black holes , each about the size of a proton but with the mass of a mountain . Then , upsetting the universal belief that nothing , not even light , can escape from a black hole , he used the quantum theory to demonstrate that these miniholes ( and larger ones too ) emit radiation . Other scientists eventually conceded that he was correct , and the black-hole emissions are now known as Hawking radiation . <P> Engrossed as Hawking is with his work , the authors say , " ALS is simply not that important to him . " He certainly does not dwell on his handicap . His succinct , synthesized-voice comments are often laced with humor ; he enjoys socializing with his students and colleagues , attends rock concerts and sometimes takes to the dance floor at discos , wheeling his chair in circles . But he can be stubborn , abrasive and quick to anger , terminating a conversation by spinning around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toes of an offender.
