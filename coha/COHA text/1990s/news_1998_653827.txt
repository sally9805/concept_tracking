<p> THE last time Samuel F. Champi was in Vietnam , he was a 24-year-old Army engineer , building a 1,000-foot-long steel bridge across the Ban Thach River on the central coast . The bridge was to be a crucial link on the main north-south highway used by American military convoys , so he pulled round-the-clock shifts to complete it by early 1969 . <p> On a tropical afternoon nearly three decades later , Mr. Champi stood stiffly in a gilded reception room here as the deputy chairman of the People 's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City awarded him a license to build 40,000 low-cost apartment units in the suburbs of this teeming city , once known as Saigon . If completed , the project will be one of the largest American business investments ever in Vietnam . <p> For Mr. Champi , now 53 and a contractor in Bernardsville , N.J. , it would also be a chance to return to Vietnam and pick up where he left off  --  as a builder in a land where Americans mostly destroyed . <p> Not that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few misgivings about his experiences in the Vietnam War . And he rejects the suggestion that he is coming back on a personal odyssey to right old wrongs or to put the war behind him . " I do n't think we owe the Vietnamese anything , because we were doing what we thought was right for them at the time , " he said . <p> Still , he concedes that history hangs over the project . Three of his partners are Vietnam veterans , and so is the retired admiral who brokered the deal , Edward D. Sheafer Jr . Mr. Champi 's company , Point Enterprises International , is named after the United States Military Academy at West Point , where he and two other partners were part of the class of 1966 . Over all , that group suffered one of the highest mortality rates in the war of all West Point classes . <p> " You could say this is an accident , but it ai n't no accident , " said Tom Carhart , a partner and classmate of Mr. Champi 's who was wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a soldier , and I did my duty as a soldier . But we caused a lot of damage in that country . It 's nice to go back and do some good . " <p> Mr. Carhart and Mr. Champi are among growing numbers of veterans who are returning to Vietnam to forge ties in a place where they once fought in battle . Several executives at Vietnam offices of American corporations served in the war ; so did many of the American consultants , entrepreneurs and even diplomats who are now active here . Pete Peterson , the United States Ambassador to Vietnam , is a former Navy pilot who was shot down by the North Vietnamese and imprisoned for more than six years ; Charles A. Ray , the newly appointed consul general in Ho Chi Minh City , served tours in Saigon and Da Nang as an Army staff officer . <p> Most veterans here , like thousands of other Americans who have arrived since President Clinton lifted the trade embargo in 1994 , are hoping to make money in this awakening land . With 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the few economies in Southeast Asia that is still growing , Vietnam is a tempting target for sharp-eyed business people . <p> But for veterans , there are motives beyond the monetary one . Whether they feel at peace with their experience here or are still nursing scars , the war has left a lasting imprint on them . Because they were witnesses to the anguish borne by the Vietnamese , most believe they can play a part in healing the wounds between the United States and Vietnam . <p> " There is a real feeling of happiness on both sides that former enemies can work together in a positive way , " Mr. Ray said . " The best people to bridge the past and the future are the people who were here in the past . That will make it easier for Americans in the future to get on with business . " <p> Certainly , the veterans are dogged in their determination to succeed in a country where many foreign investors have failed . Like most new arrivals , Mr. Champi and his partners have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complicated by capricious regulation , endless red tape and the hostility of Communist bureaucrats to free-market principles . <p> The obstacles are so great that some American companies , like Chrysler , have pulled out of Vietnam , while others , like Procter &; Gamble , have fallen into vicious squabbles with their state-controlled partners . Asia 's financial crisis has compounded the problem by forcing the main investing nations , like Singapore , Taiwan and Japan , to scale back their ambitions in the country . New foreign investment in Vietnam plunged to $1.15 billion in the first six months of 1998 , 15 percent less than in the corresponding period last year . <p> MR . CHAMPI believes that his housing project will be one of the rare successes because it meets a crying need . With a population that has swelled to 5.5 million , Ho Chi Minh City is seriously overcrowded . Families of 10 cram into tiny apartments ; people sleep on the sidewalks on bamboo mats . In 1994 , the government announced a plan to address the overcrowding by moving two million people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that , it must supply them with affordable places to live . <p> " We 're not here to build luxury hotels or take advantage of the labor force , " Mr. Champi said . " We 're here to build something there 's a great need for . It 's not something that we have to sell them on . " <p> Even so , after two years of tortuous negotiations , Point Enterprises could still see its efforts come to nothing . The company has an agreement in principle for the municipal government to buy $321 million of apartments over 11 years . The partners stand to make a profit of $39 million , but first they need financing to build a factory that would churn out the pre-cast concrete slabs for the apartments . <p> To get the financing , they will need a guarantee from the municipal government  --  and perhaps the national one , too  --  that the city will honor the contract terms . On Aug. 18 , Mr. Champi and Mr. Sheafer received a verbal commitment for such a guarantee from city officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " If we 're unable to finance this deal , it 's going to bring the sharks out , " said Mr. Carhart , a gregarious man whose free-flowing pessimism neatly balances Mr. Champi 's reserved confidence . " This is a crap shoot . It 's a high-risk venture thousands of miles from home . " <p> But the partners have not wavered , despite having invested $250,000 so far with no assurance of a return . They have maintained their resolve by drawing on a lifetime of close friendships and a shared experience that makes Vietnam a passion as well as a project . <p> In addition to Mr. Carhart and Mr. Champi , the partners are John W. Morris , a retired Army lieutenant general and chief of engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers ; Vincent Casillo , a New York City contractor , and James P. Fabiani , a senior executive at a Washington lobbying firm . With the exception of Mr. Fabiani , all are West Point graduates , Vietnam veterans or both . <p> Mr. Morris was Mr. Champi 's regimental captain at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Engineers in Vietnam , where he again supervised Mr. Champi . At 77 , with service in World War II , Korea and Vietnam behind him , Mr. Morris is a sort of guiding light for the group . <p> " I 've always felt the Vietnamese deserved a better shake than they got , " he said . " They were caught in the middle of historical forces . " <p> Mr. Casillo played middle linebacker on the West Point football team in the same years that Mr. Champi , who is 6 feet 5 inches tall , played tight end . They graduated together in 1966 , and even though they did not serve together afterward  --  Mr. Casillo was assigned to duty in Europe  --  they stayed in touch . <p> " People who go to West Point are conditioned to be particularly close , " Mr. Casillo said . " When you are with a group of people who came from the same system , there 's a camaraderie that never ends . " <p> Although the West Point contingent had already teamed up to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Sheafer , who put them on the road to Vietnam . A bluff , barrel-chested man who had risen to rear admiral and director of naval intelligence , he had been struggling to build a consulting practice in Vietnam since he retired from the Navy in 1995 . <p> Like Mr. Champi , Mr. Sheafer is not one to dwell on the war . But as a career military officer , he felt its lingering effect . He served several tours of duty in Vietnam between 1963 and 1970 , at one time commanding a minesweeper that prowled the coastal waters near the border between South and North Vietnam . <p> In one memorable incident , he said , he watched helplessly as two fishing boats smuggled ammunition across the border from the south . He tried to block the boats , but the Navy 's rules of engagement barred him from firing on them unless they fired first . He ordered an air strike , but the bombers arrived after the boats had landed in the north and emptied their cargo . <p> For years afterward , Mr. Sheafer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure in Vietnam . He said he did not come to terms with the war until 1984 , when he paid a midnight visit to the rotunda of the United States Capitol . The body of an unknown soldier from Vietnam , who has since been identified as an Air Force pilot , Michael J. Blassie , was lying in state there before its entombment at Arlington National Cemetery . <p> " I was standing there in my dress uniform , and suddenly I began crying , not because of my own hostility , but because of the futility of the whole thing , " Mr. Sheafer recalled . " There was no good legacy for these people . What did they die for ? " <p> BY the time he retired , the American military had rehabilitated its reputation with the Persian Gulf war . But to him , Vietnam was still unfinished business . So when a lawyer he knew approached him about starting a home security company in Vietnam , he jumped at the chance . <p> Mr. Sheafer plotted his return methodically . He recruited his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections to senior American officials . <p> But the going was slow . He had trouble making contacts with the right Vietnamese officials . The lawyer who promised to open doors for him failed to deliver . He spent long days in an office set up in the lounge at the upscale but somewhat dreary New World Hotel here , waiting for the phone to ring . <p> Finally , in late July 1996 , he won a meeting with Vo Viet Thanh , the chairman of the People 's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City . As it happened , Mr. Thanh had been a general in the North Vietnamese army and had supervised intelligence operations . Mr. Sheafer and Mr. Thanh chatted about the shadowy world of military intelligence , and a rapport was established . <p> Mr. Thanh told Mr. Sheafer that the city 's biggest need was for cheap housing that could be built quickly . He said he had an immediate need for about 200,000 apartments , with a long-term goal of 500,000 . Mr. Sheafer replied that he would find an American contractor who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neighbor in McLean , Va. , Mr. Sheafer stumbled onto Mr. Champi . AT first , Mr. Champi was fearful about going back to Vietnam . But he made a happy discovery upon his arrival : Younger Vietnamese did not care about his background , while older people , many of whom had fought in the North Vietnamese Army or with the Vietcong , felt a sort of kinship with him . <p> " I think all military people have a bond , regardless of what side they were on , " Mr. Champi said . " We were all doing our jobs for our country . " <p> Over the next 18 months , Mr. Champi and Mr. Sheafer made a dozen trips to Ho Chi Minh City . Their goal was to persuade the municipal government to agree to buy as many apartments from them as possible . Eventually , they hammered out a deal for 40,000 units at an average price of $8,025 each . <p> The apartments , 320 to 860 square feet in size , will be stacked in four-story blocks , using prefabrication technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that process , a factory produces standardized panels of pre-cast concrete , which are then assembled quickly into buildings , eliminating the need for structural steel girders , beams or columns . <p> Despite the Lego-block construction method , Mr. Champi said the finished buildings could last 100 years . To sell the design , he flew a team of Vietnamese architects to Singapore to inspect apartments built with the same technology . <p> The negotiations would follow a serpentine path , with breakthroughs in one session often being erased in the next . <p> Initially , for example , the government pushed foreign investors to establish joint ventures . So Point Enterprises took on a Vietnamese company as a minority partner . But last February , the Vietnamese partner  --  a company that collects bills for the city government  --  petitioned to change the terms of the joint venture in a way that would have relegated the Americans to mere subcontractors . <p> The move stunned Mr. Champi and his partners , who had put up all the seed money for the project . Fortunately for them , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with joint ventures was developing among prominent foreign investors , including Procter &; Gamble . <p> In March , Vietnam 's Prime Minister , Phan Van Khai , agreed to allow foreigners to own 100 percent of business ventures in any industry not deemed strategically important , like oil and gas or communications . Point Enterprises received permission to sever ties with its Vietnamese partner and go it alone . <p> Still , Mr. Carhart said , " there are other impediments to doing business in Vietnam . " Progress is often slow , and " individuals that approve projects have to answer to higher-ups , so no decision is ever final , " he explained . <p> At the ceremony in Ho Chi Minh City where Mr. Champi received his investment license , the deputy chairman of the People 's Committee , Tran Thanh Hai , tried to sound definitive . " We are committed to extend our support for the continuation of the project , " he said as he gingerly raised a glass of champagne . <p> Ambassador Peterson , who had come from Hanoi to attend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Issuing licenses is the easiest part of the job , " he said , " Implementation is the key word . " <p> At a reception after the ceremony , several Americans who live in Ho Chi Minh City handicapped the project 's future with weary cynicism . They predicted that the partners would suffer more setbacks before they broke ground . " They 're about 5 percent of the way there , " said Peter N. Sheridan , a Vietnam veteran who , like Mr. Sheafer , helps put together ventures . <p> Vietnamese officials know all too well that their country has a bad reputation among foreign investors . But they say the Government is working to clear the bureaucratic underbrush . One official noted that when Vietnam decided to open its economy in 1986 , the Government expected to have a decade or more in which to move from central planning to a market economy . But foreign investment began flooding into Vietnam by 1991  --  and with it came calls for accelerated change . <p> " Of course , things are not as smooth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vice director of Ho Chi Minh City 's department of planning and investment . " But they have improved a lot . " <p> ODDLY , given the time and money they have invested , the partners of Point Enterprises seem almost fatalistic about the outcome . Mr. Champi said he would treasure his trips to Vietnam even if he never got to put up an apartment block . " That may sound naive and unbusinesslike , but it 's true , " he said . <p> For Mr. Carhart , the mere act of returning to Vietnam was its own reward . As an infantry platoon leader , Mr. Carhart saw fierce fighting in the war , and was shot twice in 1968 . Then he was recruited into Operation Phoenix , a controversial program supported by the Central Intelligence Agency that sought to root out Vietcong agents working in South Vietnam , sometimes by killing them . <p> " I have terribly mixed feelings about Vietnam , " Mr. Carhart said . " On the one hand , I did my duty . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one of his business trips to Vietnam , Mr. Carhart took a day off and visited the small town south of Ho Chi Minh City where he was based during his tour with Operation Phoenix . The house where he had planned his missions , he said , had been converted into a convent . <p> " Going back to that town put wings on my heart , " he said . " You ca n't go home again , but you can sure close the circle . " <p> Chart : " Fertile Crescent " With an ample supply of cheap labor and one of the few economies in Southeast Asia that is still growing , Vietnam is a tempting target for foreign investment .
