Recapturing our motivation for missions <p> Every year for the last 20 years or more , America 's mainline denominations have cut back on the number of missionaries they send . Why ? Are missionaries no longer necessary ? Or have these churches lost the way ? <p> The question calls to mind a discussion Jesus had with the disciples near the end of his earthly life . Although he had said that he would prepare places for them in his Father 's house , ever-skeptical Thomas asked , " Lord , we do not know where you are going ; how can we know the way ? " ( John 14:5 ) . <p> In this age of skepticism and doubt , Thomas 's plea rings with relevance as today 's mainline denominations similarly lack confidence in the way . The implications are grave for the future of Christian missions . If we have lost the way , how can we expect to show the way to others ? <p> Despite any questions that may have lingered in the minds of the early Christians , they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missions every three or four years . In fact , until the great theological depression in mainline churches , even more recent Christians had no need to ask about the purpose of missions . <p> For these believers , Christ 's command was simple and urgent : save souls from a Christless eternity . Or at the very least , give them the chance to know that they are lost . Faced with this straightforward challenge , the church exploded into the modern missionary movement , a race against time and the Devil for the eternal salvation of humanity . <p> Many people consider this the classic and most familiar theology of mission : salvation free for all , but only in Christ . Solidly evangelical , it was the theology of my parents and is not as old-fashioned and outdated as some may think . This same theology is also today 's theology of the South Korean Presbyterian church , which gains three or four times more members every year than Presbyterians in America lose every year . Moreover , the vast majority of Third World churches follow this theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainline denominations . <p> This theology sent one of my brothers to the inner city , another to India , and still another into medical missions . As for myself , I was drawn into missions by the words of Robert E. Speer , then chairman of the board at Princeton Theological Seminary . In the middle of a talk he was giving to me and my classmates , he stopped , took out his watch , and said , " This watch could tick for nine and a half years without numbering the unbelievers in China alone . " I could not get this picture out of my mind . Five years later , I was in China to find some of those unbelievers . <p> Emphasizing the lostness of the unsaved and redemption in Jesus Christ alone , this theology is responsible for sending more missionaries around the globe than any other theology of mission . Through time , however , the foundations under-girding this theology began to shake . Old urgencies were denied , or at least ignored , and no one seemed sure of anything eternal anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proponents wanted a theology that redeemed the millions upon millions living in misery and filth by providing the life abundant that Jesus came to give them . The challenge became to create a future in , not beyond , history , without hunger and without hate , without sickness and without tears ; where men and women were all brothers and sisters together , justice rolled down like the waters , and the nations studied war no more . <p> Called a theology of the kingdom , this was considered the second theology of missions , a more modern , practical mindset that emphasized " works " over " grace . " In its most popular form , it has become liberation theology . At times , it has come dangerously dose to building the kingdom without the King . But kingdom theology has its merits , and its roots are biblical : the Jesus who said , " I am the way . . . " also said , " I am the life " and " As you did it to one of the least of these "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , the prisoners  --  " you did it to me " ( Matt. 25:40 ) . This is a kind of liberation I can never ridicule . <p> But in recent times , the paralysis of skepticism has struck those desiring to be liberators . Wars , holocausts , depressions , brutalities , scandals , AIDS , drugs , and failed revolutions have created a disheartening crescendo of defeat . Worst of all , these events happened right here in the " Christian " West , in what too many had believed was the kingdom . But the kingdom refused to stay built , and the liberators lost hope . <p> HAVE WE LOST THE WAY ? <p> These are the two familiar descriptions of the missionary : as evangelist and as social activist . One emphasizes the saving of souls ; the other , the building of the kingdom . Both are needed . The problem is that neither alone can motivate the whole church for missions . Critics of the Left still caricature the evangelical promise as " pie in the sky by-and-by , " while critics from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradise-here-and-now " activism of yesterday 's failed revolutions has given us more hell on earth than hope of heaven . <p> Thus the question : Have we lost the way ? How does the church fulfill its mission in this kind of a world , and in our kind of a discouraged church ? Where can we find a compelling motive to unite and renew the whole church in Christian mission ? <p> Both the unfairly caricatured evangelists and the well-intentioned but much criticized builders of the kingdom need to take a step toward a more biblical , Christ-centered theology of missions . Christ should define our mission ; anything more is idolatry , and anything less is no longer Christian . The Bible reminds us that the evangelist can no more save souls than the social gospeler can build the kingdom of God . Souls are saved by the Holy Spirit , whose witness is never separated from Jesus Christ as the only way . And only God can build the kingdom , whose promised King is Jesus Christ , Lord of all of life . <p> In their basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that different . At their best , both sincerely believe that their motive is Christian love . But love has last much of its biblical meaning in today 's post-Christian world . America 's modern culture-captive theologies use the word love in such a warm , loose , or fuzzy way that I question how far we can use it anymore to describe our motivating base in Christian mission . <p> RETHINKING OUR MOTIVATIONS <p> I would like to suggest instead that the original motivation for missions in the church was not love , but obedience  --  more specifically , obedience in love . As C. S. Lewis once observed , " We do not fail in obedience through lack of love , but have lost love because we have never attempted obedience . " <p> Of course , love , as described in the New Testament , is fundamental , still the first and greatest commandment . Love began the mission : " For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son , so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have everlasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father . But what was the motivation of God the Son ? <p> The Son surely came on his mission with no less love than that of the Father . However , it is interesting to note that the Bible does not say so . Although the life of Jesus on this earth was undeniably filled with unbounded love and compassion , we are not told that he came into the world because he loved it . Insofar as the Bible distinguishes between the Son and the Father in reference to the mission , it tells us that the Father founds the mission motivated by love , while the Son goes on the mission motivated by obedience . <p> Paul reveals a rare glimpse into the mind of Christ before the mission of his incarnation . Through the apostle 's writings , we see that it is not love , but humility and obedience " unto death , even death on a cross " ( Phil . 2:5-8 ) that compels Christ to sacrifice himself . He loves the world , but he goes to the cross because he obeys : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Luke 22:42 ) . God is love , but it is obedience that forges , focuses , and incarnates that love into a mission . <p> The same theme applies to the apostles , the first missionaries of the church . Was it love for a despised and rejected race that sent Philip to the Ethiopian ? Not according to the record . " An angel of the Lord spoke to Philip , saying , ' Arise and go ' " ( Acts 8:26 , NKJV ) . And he went . Was it love that sent Peter to the proud and unclean , to the Roman centurion ? Not if you read Acts . The Spirit told him to " Arise and go " ( Acts 10:20 ) . And he did . <p> Was it a passion for millions of lost Gentile souls dying without hope and without Christ in this world that made Saul into Paul " the apostle to the Gentiles ? " He loved his own people , the Jews , too much for that , as the record shows . But the Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them , " and thus the apostle almost reluctantly obeyed to reach the Gentiles . In the " strange new world of the Bible " ( Barth ) , apostles and missionaries are made not by looking at the world in love ( though that they must do ) , but primarily by listening to God in obedience . <p> At this point , many are inclined to change the subject in embarrassment and go on to more practical missionary matters concerning techniques , methods , cross-cultural relations , and fundraising appeals . How can we wait around to listen for the voice of God when there is a whole world out there that needs to hear the good news and see it practiced ? <p> Back in my College days , I knew an earnest and intense young woman who wanted desperately to be a missionary in Africa . But she thought that God had not called her because she had heard no supernatural calls , only silence . So one night a realistic and practical-joking friend gathered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At midnight , they stole into the troubled girl 's room , moaning in hollow tones , " Come to Africa , come to Africa . " <p> This woman , paralyzed in her waiting for the voice of God , was partly right , but partly wrong . Wrong in her stereotyped notion of how God ought to speak to her , but completely right in believing that without the positive assurance of God 's leading she would never be a missionary even if she did go to Africa . And although her joker friends were wrong to pose as substitutes for the voice of God ( a temptation for preachers and professors as well ) , they were right in portraying a God who works in his own mysterious way through imperfect human means . <p> This is especially true in missions , which is why our theology is so important . It keeps us on the fight way . We are only dressing up in white robes and stealing in upon the unwary with false guideposts and lesser challenges if we settle for anything less than truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as according to the Scriptures . <p> OBEDIENT WITNESSES <p> Two years ago we had a surprise call . A Korean pastor from the Sangdo Presbyterian Church in Seoul wanted to fly us to Chile for the ground-breaking of their new missionary project . The churches was celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary and wanted to commemorate it by undertaking a missions project in Chile . Recalling the words of Jesus to be his witnesses " unto the uttermost parts of the earth , " they pulled out a globe , put a pin in South Korea , and stretched a string as far as it would go all the way to the opposite end of the globe , which turned out to be Chile . <p> Although there were already three Korean evangelists at work in Chile , there was no Korean missionary doctor . Remembering the legacy of the first missionaries to Korea , who had initiated a wide range of social reforms , these Koreans said , " Let 's celebrate our twenty-fifth anniversary by building a Christian hospital for the Mapuche Indians in southern Chile . " The hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was as simple as that : having a firm faith and displaying cheerful obedience . If this sounds too simple for us sophisticated , Western evangelicals , I suspect we may be getting too academic , like the professor from Yale who visited our mission in northern Korea years ago . He wanted to preach in a country church , so the mission sent him with a missionary interpreter to a rural Korean village . The professor began his sermon , " All thought is divided into two categories , the concrete and the abstract . " <p> The Korean interpreter looked at the tiny congregation sitting with eager attention on the floor of the little church  --  toothless grandmothers , barefoot schoolboys  --  and made a quick decision . " Dear friends , " he translated , " I have come all the way from America to tell you about the Lord Jesus Christ . " From that point , the sermon was firmly in the interpreter 's hands . <p> I vote for more simplicity and theological integrity in the church 's approach to mission . How will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , " Oh yes , those old churches . They lost it . They gave up on missions . They talked about ' the concrete and the abstract , ' about gods and goddesses , and who knows what else . And no one understood . " <p> More non-Christians , refugees , and homeless live in the world than ever before in history , including in our own cities . At the same time , membership in many denominations is hemorrhaging at a shocking rate . The day of the missionary is far from over . We need to allow the Holy Spirit , the Great Interpreter , take over here and now with grace and power so that the world takes nonce that the church is spreading the good news of Christ . <p> Jesus responded to Thomas 's doubts by saying , " I am the way . " Nothing could be clearer for us than to follow Christ 's example in all circumstances , including our approach to missions . <p> We know the way . God promises the power . Our part is to obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationals . <p> By SAMUEL HUGH MOFFETT <p> <p> Samuel Moffett is Princeton Seminary 's Henry Winters Luce Professor of Ecumenics and Missions , emeritus .
