<p> IT is the perfect meat . It 's low in cholesterol yet high in protein , mild tasting yet rich , matchable with red or white wine , depending on how you cook it , and so easy to digest that doctors recommend it to patients with stomach troubles . It 's a meat that does just about everything , in fact , except jump into the frying pan and cook itself , like the self-sacrificing shmoos in " Li'l Abner . " <p> It 's called rabbit . And Americans do n't particularly want to eat it . <p> It 's not for lack of opportunity . Heaven knows that chefs all over town have done everything to entice their customers , tempting them with rabbit braised or stewed , rabbit lightly disguised in a clever appetizer or rabbit all but invisible in a terrine , the better to win over squeamish diners who tend to think " Easter bunny " or " rodent " when they see rabbit on the menu . Rabbit started out as a taste . Now it 's becoming a cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Lidia Bastianich , an owner of Felidia . " Rabbit is one of them . " <p> With the onset of autumn , the rabbits are multiplying . At Gascogne , rabbit is stuffed with prunes and Armagnac . Rosemarie 's , an Italian restaurant in TriBeCa , offers a rabbit ragu with pappardelle . Molyvos , the new Greek restaurant in midtown , does a rabbit braised in onions and sweet mavrodaphne wine . For at least a decade , Alfred Portale at Gotham Bar and Grill has been serving a marinated and grilled saddle of rabbit wrapped around roasted garlic and herbs , with spinach , white beans and baby fennel . <p> It can be a heartbreaking business . <p> " I only offer it as a special from time to time , " said Pierre Bellon , the chef at Les Halles . " I used to have lapin a la moutarde on the menu , but Americans would n't order it . " Mr. Bellon sighed . " If you make it , and no one eats it , where is the joy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been . A dozen years ago , when Ariane Daguin started her game-supply business , D'Artagnan , the rabbit situation looked grim . <p> " I would beg Andre Soltner at Lutece to take three or four , " Ms. Daguin recalled . " When I 'd call him a week later , he would say : ' Do n't bother me . I had to give the rabbit away to the family . ' " <p> These days , Ms. Daguin is bullish on rabbits . She says she sells about 2,000 a week to restaurants and groceries in the metropolitan area and notes with excitement that wild hare from Scotland seems to be gaining a foothold at places like Gertrude 's , Le Perigord and Les Celebrites , which offer the fiendishly complicated , criminally rich lievre a la royale . The dish is a 100-year-old classic that involves wrapping the meat around foie gras and truffles , and finishing it off with a blood sauce . At Restaurant Daniel , they do a civet of hare with a blood and chocolate sauce . <p> Spend five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that New York is trembling on the verge of a rabbit boom . In truth , the creature has merely nibbled its way from near oblivion to play a marginal if lively role on local menus . <p> A troop of chefs is leading the charge , but the followers seem to be lagging well behind , a source of puzzlement and frustration to the vanguard . <p> This is a shame . Rabbit is easy to work with and absorbs flavors like a sponge . The meat , which is all white , is a little richer and sweeter than chicken but similar enough to win converts easily . <p> So , why this reluctance to feast on a meat that occupies a place of honor in the cuisines of France , Italy , Germany and a long list of other countries ? <p> Rabbit breeders , restaurateurs and even culinary scholars point the finger at Walt Disney . When the French look at a chubby rabbit and see a candidate for a savory stew , Americans see Thumper . <p> In other words , rabbits are simply too cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bouncy little darlings , too , and they go right under the knife . " Unfortunately , Americans seem to have a hard time facing up to what 's on the plate , " Ms. Bastianich said . <p> Ms. Bastianich , who grew up in northeastern Italy , lived in easy companionship with the rabbits , chickens and goats that her grandmother kept in a pen , but when push came to shove , there was no question who was running the show . " The goat had a name , and I 'd tie a red ribbon around it , but when it came time to eat it , we ate it , " she said firmly . <p> The Disney theory has another flaw . Rabbit was already relegated to third-class citizenship long before the motion picture . Sandra Oliver , a culinary historian , thinks she knows why . " It was n't beef , " she said . <p> The colonists arrived in America with nothing but good culinary feelings toward rabbit and hare , but no sooner had they cleared enough land to graze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons . <p> " Rabbit , like most wild game , other than deer or elk , is small , " Ms. Oliver said . " You have to skin it and eviscerate it , and when you 're finished , what have you got ? It 's a lot of trouble for not very much food . " A slaughtered steer yielded hundreds of pounds of meat , a rabbit perhaps three or four . <p> In addition , beef was a high-status meat . Even well-to-do Englishmen could hope to eat beef no more than twice a week . The wide-open spaces of the New World let Americans feast on beef all the time . <p> Cookbooks tell the story . In Lettice Bryan 's " Kentucky Housewife , " published in 1839 , rabbit is roasted , stewed , boiled , grilled , fricasseed , fried and cut up for a salad . The roast rabbit sounds particularly tempting , stuffed with a mixture of sausage , butter and wine-moistened bread crumbs , then basted with butter during cooking and sweet cream after being taken off the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbit recipes disappeared . At finer restaurants , which prided themselves on serving all manner of game , right down to saddle of fawn , rabbit simply did not exist . <p> The kiss of death may have been the First World War , when meat shortages inspired the Government to promote rabbit as an easy-to-raise substitute for beef and chicken . Nothing kills the appetite faster than a Government-sponsored menu suggestion . At any rate , for the last half century , the only American who has pursued rabbit with any enthusiasm has been Elmer Fudd . <p> Now he has company . The bistro boom and the rise of European-born or European-trained chefs have put rabbit back on the plate . All over town , chefs are pushing rabbit , and some of them are pushing hard . At Tapika , David Walzog has revived one of his signature dishes from Arizona 206 , a culinary decathlon that uses the saddle , the leg and the kidney in dramatically contrasting ways . <p> The saddle , two tubes of meat that run from the neck to the tail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice , then wrapped in caul fat and grilled . After being seared and then braised in a bourbon-splashed poultry stock , and seasoned with cinnamon and morita chilies , the leg is minced and simmered in a cast-iron kettle with minuscule cubes of carrot , garlic , shallots and cilantro . The stuffing is presented in a thick cone of fried corn batter , sort of a next-wave burrito , poised on an earthy salad of rabbit kidney , porcini mushrooms and peas . <p> Behold . The silken loin meat , so tender it almost quivers on the plate , sits in a bright slick of cilantro oil dotted with exclamation points of habanero pepper , a cool-hot contrast to the spicy agitation going on inside the sweet corn cone and the rich , gamy kidney . About the only thing Tapika 's rabbit fails to do is grab a microphone and perform a half-hour of stand-up . It 's a challenge thrown down to the American taste buds : If you do n't go for this one , rabbit has no hope . <p> Just tell yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adapted from Jim Botsacos , Molyvos , Manhattan Total time : 2 hours 15 minutes <p> 1 3 1/2-pound whole rabbit , separated into 4 leg-thigh joints and 2 loin pieces Salt Freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 medium red onions , sliced 2 cloves garlic , peeled and sliced 1 1/2 cups cabernet sauvignon 1 cup mavrodaphne ( a Greek sweet red wine ) or ruby port 1 14.5-ounce can chicken broth 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice 1 sachet of 1 bay leaf , 1 cinnamon stick and 3 cloves , tied in a bundle of cheesecloth with string 1 1/2 cups pearl onions , peeled 2 teaspoons butter 1/4 teaspoon sugar Diced fresh tomatoes , for garnish ( optional ) Fried onion rings , for garnish ( optional ) . <p> 1 .
