Three decades after his historic first orbit , 77-year-old Senator John Glenn savors again the joy and challenge of space flight // On June 5 , 1968 , the day that his close friend , presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy , was mortally wounded in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles , John Glenn and his wife , Annie , flew with five of RFK 's 10 children back to the Kennedy home at Hickory Hill in McLean , Va . The next morning it was Glenn , having received the news in the middle of the night , who sat on their beds and gently woke each of the children to tell them their father had died . " It was one of the hardest things I ever did , " he would later say . Afterward , wandering in Kennedy 's study , Glenn found a book on his friend 's desk open to a passage by Ralph Waldo Emerson . He committed the words to memory , and in the years since has often used them as a parting thought in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would desire to be born in , is it not the Age of Revolution ? " John Glenn has not only lived in such a time , he helped define it . On a clear Florida morning in 1962 , 10 months after Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was hurled into orbit , Glenn , 40 , riding in a cramped titanium capsule dubbed the Friendship 7 , electrified the country by becoming the first American sent into space to circle the globe . If all goes as planned , on the morning of Oct. 29 , 1998 , Glenn , now 77 and at the end of a 24-year Senate career , will aim at yet another horizon . Taking his mid-deck seat on the shuttle Discovery and , courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution , carrying a scrap of wing fabric from the plane the Wright brothers first flew in 1903 at Kitty Hawk , N.C. , Glenn will lift off from Cape Canaveral for a nine-day mission as the oldest human being ever launched into space . " It was an exciting time , an adventurous time , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January press conference announcing his return to space . " I ca n't help but stand here before you with a real sense of deja vu .

Photograph " We owe him , and he 's worthy of it , " says NASA chief Daniel Goldin of Glenn ( at a training session in April ) . Photograph // There will be reminders of just how much time has elapsed since his original 4-hour , 55-minute flight . This time around , Glenn will take orders from Discovery commander Curt Brown , who was just shy of 6 years old at the time of Friendship 's launch . And when Glenn returns , he will be welcomed by his two grandsons , 16 and 14 , the very ages Glenn 's own two children were when their father first ventured into space . The flight has not been free of controversy . Glenn and his crewmates have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a public relations ploy by a space agency struggling with budget cuts and flagging public interest . " If we can motivate or excite more people about the space program , that can only help , " says Brown . " But that 's not what this flight is for . " Explains Glenn , a member of the Senate 's Committee on Aging : " The changes-balance problems , cardiovascular changes and muscle breakdown-that happen to astronauts in orbit also occur as a part of the aging process , and I thought it was a very valuable area of research . " To that end he will , during Discovery 's voyage , provide blood and urine samples and wear 21 sensors monitoring everything from respiration to brain-wave patterns . By liftoff he will have spent more than 500 hours in training , shimmying down an escape pole , being dropped ( in full gear ) 25 feet into a pool of water and weathering multiple G-forces in a centrifuge . " Even learning how to use the toilet on the spacecraft is new , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to need it . " Few who know him doubt that Glenn still has the right stuff . " For privacy reasons I ca n't tell you what he went through on his physical , but it was n't just a few blood samples , " says NASA administrator Daniel Goldin , who made the decision to send him . " Let 's just say he 's the most tenacious human being on the face of the planet . " And maybe the happiest . " The guy 's so excited , " says his buddy astronaut Gene Cernan , 64 , " he might as well be 15 years old again . " It was in those simpler times that Glenn , the older of two children , first took an interest in flight . Born in Cambridge , Ohio , shortly before his father ; John Herschel , a plumbingand-heating store owner , and mother , Clara Sproat , a former schoolteacher , moved to nearby New Concord , Glenn spent hours making model airplanes as a boy . " I used to fly them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd put them back together and fly them again . " One day at a small grass airstrip , when a man in a real plane offered them a ride , " Dad decided it would be great if we went up , so he and I sat together in the little back seat , strapped in the open cockpit . I was fascinated with aviation from then on . " That and Annie Castor , daughter of a local dentist . " John was n't popular with the girls , because he only had one , " says childhood friend Lloyd White , a retired Methodist minister . By eighth grade , Glenn and Annie were going steady and marching together in the school band ; he on trumpet , she on trombone . One thing she liked about him was that he was n't bothered by the severe stutter that she later conquered as an adult . " John was always very patient about my speech , " she told PEOPLE in 1980 . " All the time we went together , he never mentioned it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( at 16 , with her future husband in Ohio ) . Glenn 's parents , John and Clara , pose in the ' ' 50s with Annie , his nephew Billy Pinkston ( top left ) and kids Lyn and Dave . // After enrolling at Muskingum , a Presbyterian college in New Concord , Glenn got his pilot 's license and planned to do medical research . But when , during his junior year , he heard about the bombing of Pearl Harbor on his car radio , he came to two decisions : He would enlist in the Marines , and he would marry Annie-which he did , on April 6 , 1943 . " John only made one promise to me on that wedding day , " she says . " He said life would never be dull . " He was a man of his word . After fighter training near San Diego , Glenn was off to the South Pacific , where he flew 59 combat missions . " My plane was hit five times , " says Glenn , who earned 20 medals over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional Space Medal of Honor " Some were single bullet holes , but one took a big chunk out of the leading edge of the wing . " After the war , the Glennsnow with an infant daughter , Lyn , and a 2-year-old son , Davidtouched down at a number of bases , landing in Corpus Christi , Texas . Before returning to war in Korea , Glenn trained on the Air Force 's first jets . He flew 90 missions , and in the last nine days of the fighting shot down three MiGs . After the war , Glenn trained on supersonic jets , and in July 1957 set a record with a 3-hour , 23-minute flight from L.A. to New York in an F8U Crusader . But his biggest flying challenge lay ahead . In 1958 , while stationed at the now-defunct Navy Bureau of Aeronautics , he heard about NASA 's fledgling space program . " They were looking for test pilots , " he says , " and I had just come off that duty . So I applied . " In April 1959 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 130 applicants to become the Mercury 7 astronauts . True to Tom Wolfe 's portrayal in his 1979 book The Right Stuff , the straitlaced Glenn " was very concerned , 24 hours a day , about what our reputation was , " says fellow astronaut Gordon Cooper , 71 , now a Van Nuys , Calif. , aerospace consultant . " It was a bit higher priority with him than some of the rest of us . " Photograph // Despite his eagerness to be the first in space , Glenn was passed over for the first two launches . " When Al Shepard was picked to be the first , John did n't say much . He just got sort of withdrawn , " says longtime friend Tom Miller , now a retired lieutenant general . " When Gus Grissom got the second flight , I was afraid for him , he was so depressed When he finally drew duty , a determined Glenn dropped 40 pounds to meet the capsule 's critical weight limit . " His body was in good shape , but his eyeballs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He looked like death warmed over . " When the time came , Glenn and Annie spoke a farewell practiced over his years in the military . " I 'm going down to the corner store and buy some chewing gum , " Glenn would say . " Well , " replied Annie , " do n't take too long . " Still , according to an account in LIFE , when Friendship 7 blasted off , Annie , who had once witnessed the launchpad explosion of an unmanned Atlas rocket , " put her head against her knees and sobbed . " His takeoff was flawless , but Glenn suffered a serious scare when it looked as if his heat shield might fail ( " I saw big burning chunks of something coming back past the window , " he recalls ) . Despite worldwide acclaim , Glenn did not return to space . Years later he learned that his friend President John E Kennedy was responsible . " I do n't know if he was afraid of the political fallout if I got killed , " Glenn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , he had been dead for some time , so I never got to discuss it with him . " Instead , in 1964 , inspired by the Kennedys , Glenn quit NASA and shifted his focus to a campaign for the Senate-at least until a bathroom fall damaged his inner ear and forced him to withdraw . Afterward , between becoming a vice president for the Royal Crown Cola Co. and an investor in several Holiday Inns , he lost a second Senate bid in 1970 . " I may have been almost too wellknown , " he says . At rallies , " some little kid in the front row would always ask , Mr. Glenn , do astronauts really drink Tang ? " ' He finally won his Senate seat in 1974 , though a 1984 run for the Presidency failed miserably . " He would come to a fund-raiser and stand in a corner talking to Annie or a Secret Service guy , rather than going through the room begging people he did n't particularly respect for money , " says Scott Miller , then his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is one of the worst politicians . " Photograph Glenn called his lackluster keynote speech at the ' ' 76 Democratic convention " a bomb . " Photograph " He 's a very gentle man , " says Annie of Glenn ( at home in ' ' 74 ) . " He has n't changed . " // Over four terms in the Senate , Glenn worked tirelessly as a member of the committees on armed services , aging , governmental affairs and intelligence , on what even he refers to as " MEGO issues-for My Eyes Glaze Over , " ' says former committee staffer Paul Light . In 1991 the only tarnish to his political career came in the form of a mild reprimand from the Senate Ethics Committee , which named him one of two senators who had used " poor judgment " in appearing to arrange political favors for Charles Keating , a California financier convicted of bilking his savings and loan out of more than $2 billion . Having been an effective , if not preeminent , senator , Glenn announced his retirement in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Although my health remains excellent and my passion for the job burns as brightly as ever , " he said , " there is still no cure for the common birthday . " What few knew was that two years earlier he had already begun lobbying to return to space . Initially , the stiffest opposition to Glenn 's final flight may well have come from his wife , who now supports his mission . " You might say I had given John to our country for almost 55 years , " says Annie , now 78 , " and I was ready to take him as my own . " That time will come , Glenn promises , not long after he returns to Washington to vacate his Senate office just across the Mall from where his wellworn flight suit and battered Friendship 7 space capsule are on display at the National Air and Space Museum . Those artifacts , which may soon be joined by items from his final venture into space , will be the things by which John Glenn is remembered .
