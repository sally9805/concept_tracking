<p> ON SUNDAY MORNING , SEPT. 30 , 1990 , Kirk Kerkorian summoned his closest aides and lawyers to his Beverly Hills home for a 10 o'clock meeting . Kerkorian appeared on the dot , barefoot , in tennis shorts . <p> " It used to be that when we wanted to buy some stock , we would just pick up the phone and place an order , " Kerkorian began , " but life has gotten so complicated , with the SEC rules and all , it 's important to cross your t 's and dot your i 's . " <p> The group waited expectantly . <p> " I 'm going to buy 10% of the Chrysler Corp. , or just under 10% , " Kerkorian said . <p> The room was silent . Chrysler ? Nobody present knew much about Chrysler ; it was not the type of business that normally interested Kerkorian . What was he thinking ? <p> The first person to speak was an owlish-looking man in horn-rimmed glasses . Michael Tennenbaum was vice chairman for investment banking at the big Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is going to create some kind of battle , " Tennen- baum said . <p> " No , " replied Kerkorian , " I know Iacocca . He 's going to welcome me . " Kerkorian and Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca had met the previous year at a horse racing awards dinner in Los Angeles . They had hit it off and had later discussed possible investments in each other 's companies . Nothing had come of those private talks , but Kerkorian had come away with great respect for Iacocca . <p> " I never met a chief executive without a 10% shareholder who wanted a 10% shareholder , " Tennenbaum said . " Never . " <p> " Lee 'll be happy because I 'm going to protect him from other people , " Kerkorian replied . " This company is vulnerable to takeover . " <p> " Well , do you think you might want to discuss this with Iacocca ahead of time ? " Tennenbaum asked . <p> " Nope , I want you to buy the stock . " <p> " I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I think . " <p> " I 'd rather you would n't , " Kerkorian said , getting annoyed . <p> Tennenbaum was stunned . Clients usually paid him big money for such advice . Here was one who clearly neither wanted nor needed it . " But , Kirk , we will put the entire Bear , Stearns organization at your disposal . We will do a very in-depth analysis . " <p> Kerkorian leaned across the table , his patience wearing thin . " Michael , if you and Bear , Stearns develop an opinion on Chrysler , please keep it . I 'm placing an order . Do you want it or not ? " <p> Obviously he did . The brokerage commission could be nearly $2 million . Tennenbaum suggested the purchases should be personally handled by Bear , Stearns ' chairman , Alan ( Ace ) Greenberg , a big-block securities trader of legendary skill . <p> " No , no , I want you to buy the stock , " Kerkorian insisted . " I do n't want anybody else involved , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " <p> It was the only argument Kerkorian lost that day . He finally acquiesced to using Greenberg . The meeting spread from the dining room into the adjacent living room before breaking up after a couple of hours . <p> " Kirk may be going crazy , " Tennenbaum told Greenberg later that day by phone . " He wants to buy 10% of Chrysler . " " Do n't ever tell Babe Ruth how to hold his bat , " cautioned Greenberg . <p> Tennenbaum 's concern about Chrysler was shared by Kerkorian 's other advisers , who found themselves agreeing with the then-conventional Wall Street wisdom that Chrysler was a bad investment : slumping car and truck sales , $4 billion in debt , $3.6 billion in unfunded pensions . <p> None of which mattered to Kerkorian , who told Ace Greenberg to place the first orders for Chrysler stock in early October . The shares were purchased under a company name fabricated for the occasion to preserve secrecy . Greenberg began with relatively small purchases  --  share blocks of 50,000 , 75,000 and 36,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares at an average cost of about $10.80 a share . After a week 's gap he began again with small amounts , and over the next month added nearly 9 million shares in amounts ranging from 1,500 shares to 4.6 million . By now , however , the price was rising . With only half the desired amount accumulated , the likelihood of a leak increased . That leak came shortly after Thanksgiving . <p> Iacocca invited Kerkorian to meet in New York on Dec. 7 . Iacocca was not happy . In fact , the Chrysler chairman presented Kerkorian with a so-called standstill agreement , a pledge not to buy more than the 5%he had already accumulated . <p> Though Kerkorian knew such agreements were common , he pretended to be surprised and offended . He said he had bought the stock because of his " high regard " for Iacocca but had no intention of acquiring more than 10% of the company . He refused to sign . " I 'm not going to agree to anything , " he said . " This is America . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promptly bought another 11 million Chrysler shares , doubling his holdings to 22 million , or 9.8% . He then filed the required report , known as a 13D , with the Securities &; Exchange Commission . <p> In an emergency board meeting , Chrysler reduced to 10% from 20% the level of an outsider 's stock purchase that would trigger the company 's poison-pill defense mechanism against hostile takeovers . <p> In portraying Kerkorian 's latest major investment , the media trotted out all the old cliches that for years had mischaracterized Kerkorian . He was an " asset-stripper , " the Washington Post said , " buying companies whole and then selling various parts for big profits . " <p> As many others had , the newspaper had Kerkorian all wrong . <p> The stock began to climb . By the end of 1992 it was around $32 . By mid-1994 it had moved well into the 40s . <p> But Kerkorian still felt that Chrysler management was n't doing enough to increase the stock 's value . Other major financial players were starting to think the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trust Co. of the West , a Los Angeles money manager that owned a big block of Chrysler stock , and his friend Gary Wilson . Disney 's former chief financial officer , Wilson had just gotten very rich recapitalizing Northwest Airlines . Deciding to look into Chrysler , they deployed a financial analyst , Albert Boyer , to take the measure of the firm . <p> Oblivious to these moves , Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton , who by then had succeeded the retired Lee Iacocca , traveled to Beverly Hills on Sept. 19 , 1994 to meet his big new stockholders . Kerkorian told Eaton that to enhance stockholder value he should raise the dividend , split the stock and buy in some shares . Eaton listened , but replied that his first priority was building a cash reserve of $7.5 billion to protect Chrysler in a downturn . Kerkorian did n't think the reserve needed to be that large . <p> Two weeks later analyst Albert Boyer reported to Gary Wilson that a recapitalization of Chrysler , led by its own management , would make sense . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financing , but the underlying value of the corporation would more than support it . It would not be a leveraged buyout in which assets had to be sold . <p> Gary Wilson sought out Lee Iacocca and relayed the notion of a buyout . Iacocca liked the idea and called Kerkorian . " You know what ? " Iacocca said . " Gary Wilson and Robert Day want to do a buyout of Chrysler . They 've done a model . " <p> Iacocca , Wilson and Boyer presented the proposal to Kerkorian at his Beverly Hills office on Oct. 10 . At first Kerkorian spurned them . Kerkorian wanted to push Eaton , not gang up on him . But within days he filed a Schedule 13D that informed Chrysler and the entire investment world that he was now considering a takeover of Chrysler . At that point it was a bluff , but nobody but Kerkorian knew that . <p> On Dec. 1 Chrysler announced a 60% dividend increase , a $1 billion stock repurchase and a lifting of the poison-pill defense trigger to 15% . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million more shares , raising his holding above 10% for the first time . He also turned his attention back to Gary Wilson . <p> Wilson and Albert Boyer had by then broached their top-secret buyout plan , dubbed Project Beta , to Chrysler in private . Chief Financial Officer Gary Valade and Executive Vice President Thomas Denomme seemed receptive , but opposed any role for Iacocca , feeling that as a former chief executive he 'd hamper anynew initiatives . <p> Back in Beverly Hills Gary Wilson briefed Kerkorian on the contacts with Chrysler . For the recapitalization plan to succeed , Wilson felt , Eaton would have to be persuaded to take the lead . That would take time . <p> But Kerkorian was growing impatient . He felt there was a time for every move and the time for this one was running out : The stock was comparatively cheap and he wanted to buy before it went up . So on the evening of Apr. 10 , Kerkorian called Wilson to tell him he was going to make an offer of $55 a share the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shocked , Wilson said he did n't feel Eaton or other top executives were yet on board . <p> When Kerkorian informed Eaton by phone the next day of his plan , Eaton replied , " We ca n't join you in this . " <p> Wilson and Iacocca met with Kerkorian in Las Vegas the following day . Eaton was nervous enough about Kerkorian , but was even more concerned at the prospect of Iacocca 's apparent involvement in what now seemed to be an unfriendly move to take control . Chrysler urgently marshalled a potent defense team  --  the investment banking houses of First Boston and Salomon Brothers and the law firm of Simpson Thacher &; Bartlett . <p> The word went out : Kerkorian is a raider . Kerkorian is a Vegas guy . Calls went out to commercial and investment bankers : Anyone doing business with Chrysler will lose that business if they aid the Kerkorian effort . <p> That slammed the door on Kerkorian 's financing efforts . Still , he bought an additional 14 million shares , bringing his total to 52 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next and to protect his investment , he hired an Iacocca favorite , former Chrysler chief financial officer Jerome York . Kerkorian tried to force York onto the Chrysler board . But he was rejected . <p> Kerkorian finally agreed to sign a standstill agreement in February 1996 . <p> Yes , Chrysler management had won the battle for control . But Kerkorian had won the war . His secret all along was that he never wanted to take Chrysler over , but wanted to influence it for the benefit of shareholders . Just about everything Kerkorian pressured Chrysler to do , it eventually did . It raised dividends multiple times , split the stock 2-for-1 last year and reorganized its management . Kerkorian 's total investment in Chrysler stock was $1.5 billion , $1 billion of which he borrowed . It is now worth $3.3 billion and has earned him $400 million in dividends . <p> Says Michael Tennenbaum , the Bear , Stearns investment banker who was initially skeptical : " All the smart guys , including me , said , ' Do n't get involved in a cyclical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he stuck with it . " <p> Ace Greenberg was right : Kirk Kerkorian knows value the way Babe Ruth knew how to hold a bat .
