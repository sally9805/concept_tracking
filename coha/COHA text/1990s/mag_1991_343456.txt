MISS SAIGON Music by Claude-Michel Schonberg <P> Lyrics by Richard Maltby Jr . and Alain Boublil <P> If spectators can clear their minds of the hoopla about the record $37 million advance sales , the $10 million production cost , the $100 top ticket price , the ethnic controversies over stereotypes and casting , and the residual political furor over the Vietnam War  --  in other words , of all the things that make Miss Saigon an event rather than simply an entertainment  --  they may find that the musical that opened on Broadway last week is a cracking good show . It blends a love story and a spectacle with tragic social commentary about what the West symbolizes to the Third World , which is not peace and freedom so much as money and security . The plot is the sad , simple story of a soldier and a peasant woman , flung together and pulled apart by twists of fate . The stage mechanics feature that famous ( or infamous ) last helicopter taking off from the U.S. embassy in 1975 , leaving loyal Vietnamese servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooker bars , all nighties and neon . But the themes could not be bigger : geopolitical rescue missions that turn into fiascos , whole peoples ' opportunities being thwarted through accidents of birth , the sheer randomness of how riches are distributed on this planet . <P> The blasted hopes of Kim , a country maiden turned bar girl turned bride-to- be turned stateless refugee , are a paradigm for all the promises that Western powers made but failed to keep in Vietnam and other colonies . Her yearning is echoed comically and tragically in her sometime pimp , a Eurasian hustler called the Engineer , whose vision of the U.S. is a pathetic pop mishmash of the Statue of Liberty , big white Cadillacs and Fred Astaire , but whose one certainty is that he was born to live the American Dream  --  a hope he will never fulfill . The propulsive narrative works at all times as both romantic melodrama and astringent metaphor .

The Broadway production has three . Pryce and Salonga are repeating ( indeed , enhancing ) their West End triumphs . She is incandescently in command of the stage ; he still gets the sardonic laughs owed to his Dickensian lampoon of a conniver , yet has transmuted him into a full-blown tragic figure , a victim of global politics all the sadder for being so streetwise . They are joined in the spotlight by Willy Falk in the role of Kim 's G.I. lover , Chris , a part that was a cipher in London . Falk finds charm , erotic fervor and moral confusion in a man who serves as a metaphor for the U.S. 's blundering good intentions at playing global policeman . Salonga used to have to carry alone the idea that this was a doomed love worthy of Romeo and Juliet , not just a one-night stand that got out of hand .
