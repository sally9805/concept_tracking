At a time when most state governments are clamoring for more local control , the District of Columbia wants just the opposite  --  less . In an extraordinary press conference last week , Mayor Marion Barry asked the Federal Government to take over many of the city 's most important services . Acknowledging for the first time publicly that the city is on the verge of bankruptcy , Barry said the District could no longer run itself and asked for $267 million in federal aid to pay off a staggering Medicaid bill . <P> Barry ordered deep cuts in social programs affecting everyone from pregnant women to the homeless . He plans to eliminate 4,000 jobs from the bloated , 42,000-worker bureaucracy . This is a small price to pay for the solvency and noncollapse of the District of Columbia , ' ' Barry said . We should have never taken on all these functions in the first place . ' ' <P> Carrying out those functions used to be a point of pride . Since 1974 , Washington , D.C. , has enjoyed limited self-government under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the District $650 million a year , allows it to function almost like a state . Washington oversees its own Medicaid programs , issues its own license plates and runs prisons . Many residents are fiercely supportive of home rule and suspicious of the Federal Government 's involvement in District affairs . <P> Now , however , Congress may be called in to help right a fiscal and bureaucratic mess . Representative James T. Walsh of New York , chairman of the congressional subcommittee that oversees the District 's financial affairs , said he has already contacted White House officials to hash out bailout scenarios , including the establishment of a board to take control of city finances . Walsh told that his congressional colleagues are leery of Barry 's proposal because the District has failed to make good on promised cuts in the past . The Mayor has basically said we should give him $267 million and he 'll get the books balanced , but Congress is n't going to do that . They did it four years ago , and it did n't work . ' ' <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry increased his base of supporters in the 1980s by expanding government jobs by the thousands and awarding contracts on a no-bid basis . By the time his third term ended with an arrest for cocaine possession , the city was barreling toward financial disaster . When Sharon Pratt Kelly took over in 1991 , she inherited a $300 million deficit , and the city had a higher per-capita expenditure than any other American city  --  $9,516 . She did little to improve the situation . <P> The District has also suffered from demographic factors . In the past 35 years , its population has declined 25% , to its current 570,000 . Middle-class families have moved to suburbs in Maryland and Virginia , depriving the city of millions of dollars in property-tax revenues . For the past several months , the District has been so broke that officials have refused to pay hundreds of contractors for work they have already done . It 's devastating , ' ' says Lori Kaplan , executive director of a Latino youth center to which the city has owed $275,000 since last October . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped out .
