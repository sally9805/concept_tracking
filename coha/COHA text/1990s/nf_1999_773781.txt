txt // adaptive preferences . As Marx recognized , our preferences are often , and perhaps always , adaptations to natural , social , economic , and political circumstances beyond our control . What liberals typically assume to be free and voluntary consent may simply be adaptations to circumstances in which live options have been confined to narrow limits . In recent years some feminist writers have noted this problem and have deployed it in attacks against liberal notions of consent . Their claim is that what liberals take to be women 's free and voluntary consent to various arrangements is spurious when and because it is based on preferences that are adaptive to circumstances over which they have little control . The term adaptive preferences , however , might well be a pleonasm . As we have already noted , all beliefs have causes , even if they do not all have reasons . So in this sense , at least , even the most capricious or whimsical preferences conceivably could be described as adaptations to " nonsubjective " factors , biological , social , or otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jefferson made the connection between pragmatism and the experiment of democracy : N ature has constituted utility to man , the standard and test of virtue . Men living in different countries , under different circumstances , different habits and regimens , may have different utilities ; the same act , therefore , may be useful , and consequently virtuous in one country which is injurious and vicious in another differently circumstanced . " Jefferson also recognized that a particular description of institutions and practices that proves useful to some people may be worse than useless to others within the same country . It all depends on who " we " are . Recognizing this , as we have seen , his pragmatist successors , like his sophist predecessors , have shined a spotlight on " us " and directed the question of who " we " are to center stage . Like Jefferson and James , Rorty acknowledges the nonuniversal , contingent , " historically situated " character of his own normative // views : " What counts as rational or as fanatical , " he notes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary to justify ourselves ? to the body of shared belief which determines the reference of the word ' we . ' Educated inhabitants of what Rorty , following Roberto Unger , has dubbed the " rich North Atlantic democracies " 35 think it is necessary to justify themselves to various " we 's " of different degrees of exclusivity . " We " in the broadest sense might correspond to one 's ethnos , which " comprises those who share enough of one 's beliefs to make fruitful conversation possible . " 36 Within the context of public affairs , then , it behooves seekers of truth to abandon the search for conditions of possibility of experience , and instead to foster as much intersubjective agreement as possible about what is good in the way of belief . Extending the reference of " us " as far as possible in this way may involve not only the persuasion of people with whom one already shares enough in common to engage in fruitful discus:Um , but also the attempt to make oneself understood to more and more people with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged setting aside such " Kantian questions " as " What should I do ? What may I hope ? What is man ? " and fixing instead on " Deweyan questions , " such as " Which communities ' purposes shall I share ? " 37 Reviewing his references to the communities whose purposes he shares , it is possible to group them into two broad categories : On the one hand , there is a " private us , " an " us insiders who share Derrida 's backFound , who find the same rather esoteric things as funny or beautiful or moving as he does , " " educated , comfortably off , cosmopolitan prokssionals " " who have read and pondered Plato , Newton , Kant , Marx , Darwin , Freud , Dewey , etc. , " an " us for whom the discourse of philosophy actually has been important . " On the other hand , there is a ' public us , " as in " we social democrats , " " we liberal intellectuals , " " we modern inheritors of the traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... liberal Rawlsian searchers for consensus , " ' us American liberals , " and " we missionaries of the American Dream . " When he writes that " We should he more willing than we are to celebrate bourgeois capitalist society as the best polity actualized so far , " ' ? Rorty is explicitly addressing the latter " us . " Presumably , the background " we " share with I ) errida is first and // foremost educational : What " we philosophy professors , " " us middleclass intellectuals in American and European universities , " or " we Anglo-Saxon philosophers " have in common with " we Western liberal intellectuals " is having read lots of books.4 ' For Rorty , philosophy with a small p is one form of literature among others and should become or is in the process of becoming " culture criticism . " iz So , in keeping with his views on the aims of philosophy , Rorty 's project would appear to consist , in large part , of " continuing the conversation " with contemporaries and precursors in philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparative literature . Education and the leisure time necessary to read lots of books , of course , are not universally accessible . Slum dwellers in Lima , longshoremen in Lagos , and working mothers in East Los Angeles are not likely to have the leisure time ? let alone the acquired taste ? for reading lots of books by Rorty 's preferred authors . So whether or not we powerful , discursive types " 43 are powerful because we are discursive , we certainly are discursive because we are powerful . Rorty acknowledges this . As it turns out , " we " happen to be " the community of the liberal intellectuals of the secular modern West , " " us relatively leisured intellectuals , inhabiting a stable and prosperous part of the world , " " us ? educated , leisured policy makers of the West , " " people like ourselves ? middle-class American and European readers of magazines like Dissent , " " we American romantic secularists , " " we rich North American bourgeois , " and " we rich , fat , tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unlikely to dispute a critic 's characterization of him as catering to a leisured elite ? intellectual yuppies ? neither racked by pain nor immersed in toil ? whose lives may be devoted to the practice of aesthetic enhancement , and in particular to generating self , other and genealogical descriptions " From the perspective of its public role , this leisured elite would appear to correspond to Alastair Maclntyre 's Managers , and perhaps to some of his Therapists , too . These , together with the Rich Aesthetes ( Rorty 's " private we 's " ) , allegedly dominate " our culture , " both civic and private . // According to this picture , then , there are private communities dedicated to aesthetic enhancement and there are public communities that dominate political culture . Community , however , is preeminently a public category . This is because , according to Rorty , the private sphere is the sphere of aloneness , narcissism , and idiosyncrasy : The point of private life in Rorty 's liberal utopia , as he describes it in " The Contingency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oneself a creature that is not only new but unique . He denies that there is or should be any consensus about competing conceptions of the good life . Accordingly , he does not emphasize private " we 's , " except for " tiny circles of initiates , " 46 small bands of kindred souls drawn together by the private projects they share . Whether public or private , however , what Rorty 's " we 's " have in common evidently is a shared educational background , thanks to leisure , wealth , and freedom from censorship in the North Atlantic . Thanks to this common background , " we " have the freedom to run for office or write novels as we wish , depending on our idiosyncratic conceptions of personal perfection . Self-identification and considerations of audience have a crucial bearing on the manner in which Rorty presents his views and on his evaluation of rational argumentation . He would not agree that he himself ' has provided a sustained argument against the old sort of philosophy . ' " Drawing on the arguments of Quine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reductios of the analytic tradition , he wants to convince his audience that a philosophical defense of liberalism is unnecessary . This is not to say , however , that he does not believe in promoting liberalism . He most emphatically does . Indeed , he describes himself frankly as engaged in apologetics , in the sense of " a circular justification of our practices " which " makes one feature of our culture look good by t ititig still another . " " Mincing even fewer words , he has described his writings on moral and social questions as " a PR job " " " for liberalism . Noting that tier him , as for Wittgenstein , language is a " tool , " not a medium of coniniunication open to rational analysis from a position outside of any particular language , Da ? id Ilan has concluded that : // There is little to be gained from attempting to micromanage , finetune , disassemble , or deconstruct the account Rorty provides . The best one can do is to judge the relative attractiveness of Rorty 's views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conclude that " Rorty 's philosophy is closed to rational analysis , critique or dialectic . " 51 This conclusion is precipitous . The fact that Rorty emphasizes rhetoric over argumentation and deploys a wide variety of rhetorical techniques in making his point does not imply that he has entirely eschewed argumentation , if we use the word as he does , in a sense in which the term rational argumentation is pleonastic.S2 As the reader might have guessed from remarks earlier in this section , Rorty 's only criterion of rationality , if indeed it could be so viewed , is that it is " the way we do things around here . " S3 And as the reader might have guessed from the preceding section , " around here " is , if not exclusively philosophy departments , then at least in large part academia ? that is , an enclave inhabited by people unusually well prepared to produce sentence sequences that conform to the rules of formal logic ; to engage in dialectic and criticism ; to recognize " informal fallacies " when they encounter them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the course of making his positions look good Rorty appears to argue for them much as other writers do.54 Rorty offers reasons for changing certain subjects ; he respects logical consistency as well as the next philosopher , and he attacks opponents when they resort to such so-called informal fallacies as , say , ad hominem arguments directed against the philosopher Heidegger and the genetic fallacy with reference to the iniquitous origins of existing liberal democracies . As we can see , however , his recourse to philosophical argumentation remains justifiable on pragmatic grounds even though he does not address his writings of recent years exclusively to analytic philosophers but to a wider audience in various intellectual precincts . Because the educated intellectuals , philosophers , and professors with whom he identifies himself and to whom he thinks it is necessary to justify himself are specially trained to identify and defer to cogent arguments , philosophical argumentation of the sort one finds in // I'MN and elsewhere is an especially effective rhetorical technique for bringing his audience around to his point of view . True , Rorty 's audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less impervious to flattery and argumenta ad populum than many members of that audience would like to admit : As Rorty points out in his paper " Philosophy in America Today , " " the way things are done in philosophy departments in the anglophone countries today typically resembles more closely the practice of a clever lawyer , juggling briefs , citing precedents and case law , and so on , than that of white-smocked laboratory researchers driven only by the passion for disclosing truth . Nevertheless , what distinguishes " us for whom the discourse of philosophy actually has been important " from a wider audience presumably is that members of the former community are more impressed by the sort of argumentation of which philosophers have long considered themselves to be exemplary practitioners . So Hall may be right when he writes that Rorty 's dependence upon metaphors rather than statements , pictures rather than arguments , and global interpretations , rather than internal analyses of the thinkers he employs , means that the persuasive dimension of his thinking is stressed above that of the strictly logical.56 Ile is mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rorty 's thinking can be promoted effectively without the " strictly logical " dimension . In view of his projected audience , the latter dimension is a pragmatically authorized instance of the former . STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS I his last point might require more elaboration , in the form of a few orcls about my strategy in the following chapters . By way of preview , I should first summarize our political differences : Rorty describes existing liberal democracies as doing the best job of any comparable wt up so far , and the best jol , of any setup fir which we can realistically hope , when it conies to promoting two most precious ideals . These // ideals are personal freedom and ameliorating suffering . According to my account , by contrast , existing liberal democracies do a singularly poor job of it on both scores . Without disputing Rorty 's view that liberal institutions such as independent judiciaries , representative democracy , and a press free from direct state censorship are precious innovations , I make the case in chapters 3 and 4 that state power in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " rich North Atlantic democracies " promote economic inequality and the political powerlessness of the majority domestically , and tyranny and misery outside of their cartographic borders . I then proffer an alternative to liberal democracy , one which I believe holds better promise for advancing freedom and ameliorating suffering . More than one reviewer has felt that this line of criticism begs the question , since Rorty could always parry my attack by invoking the notion of incommensurable descriptive vocabularies : Without the criteria of correspondence to reality or expression of inner essence to appeal to , he could always take refuge in the claim that , outside of our respective vocabularies themselves , there is no court of appeal to adjudicate which set of descriptions of actual liberal practices better pays its way . For his purposes , his descriptive vocabulary is better in the way of belief than mine . End of story . Admittedly , Rorty does provide plenty of fodder for this interpretation , or something like it . In his 1972 paper " The World Well Lost , " and occasional comments in PMN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opined that there is no fact of the matter , and no way the world is . These formulations have led some readers to conclude that he wants to have his cake and eat it , too ? that he wants to be a relativist ( that is , a person who believes that every belief on a topic under discussion is as good as every other ) , " but he does not want to be identified as one . It should not come as a surprise that Rorty denies these accusations . One problem , of course , has to do with the ambiguity of the term " vocabulary , " and the ambiguity of other words that Rorty uses as near-synonyms , including " theory , " " jargon , " and " language . " Unless one were able to distinguish one vocabulary , jargon , or language from another in the first place , it is not clear how one could pronounce two vocabularies , jargons , or languages incommensurable . Still , we do somehow distinguish // alchemy from chemistry , Blake 's manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics from that of Newton . Rather than searching for some sort of formal criteria to account for how we make these distinctions , it strikes me as much more in the spirit of Dewey to look to the consequences or purposes of the language speakers . Thus , if Rorty 's vocabulary and mine are incommensurable , then this is the case to the extent that his is useful for certain purposes which I do not share , and which are irrelevant to the purposes my vocabulary serves . This seems to be the case when we review the examples of incommensurable vocabularies Rorty cites : The fact that Newton 's jargon helps us to predict and control the behavior of medium-sized objects better than Aristotle 's jargon does not make the former better or truer than the latter , because ( according to Rorty , at any rate ) Aristotelians have not been primarily interested in this sort of prediction and control when they have described the order of things , but have had other aims foremost in mind . Likewise , Saint Paul 's soteriological aims were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not the same as Dryden 's , and so on . This observation , however , has a corollary : Although there is no relation of logical entailment here , it is reasonable to assume that , given communicative competence on the part of the interlocutors , it is to the point to compare two sets of descriptions when they are intended to serve the same purposes , or when in fact they do serve the same purposes . This seems to be the way " we , " in some broad sense of the pronoun , tend to do things around here , and it is in the spirit of Dewey 's search for consensus . I should admit at least in passing that Rorty 's manner of expression is not my favorite way of articulating a partisan view . When it comes to my own normative political expositions , I prefer to launch them from the perspective of promoting workers as a class to state power , rather than taking part in what strike me as somewhat vapid ventilations about ameliorating evitable suffering and promoting " freedom " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis : In the present discussion I have explicitly adopted Rorty 's manner of expression ? as well as the two Ain-mentioned ideals or purposes he professes to hold highest - in order to avert the charge that I have merely juxtaposed an incommensurable vocabulary to his . The brunt of my argument in chapters 3 // and 4 is that the existing liberal democracies which Rorty is concerned with defending do not in fact promote these ideals or purposes . Starting with chapter 3 , however , I also counterpoise an alternative vocabulary to Rorty 's ? a vocabulary that includes such key terms as class struggle , political power , and ideology . Aside from considerations of elaborating more comprehensive and elegant descriptions of social transformations , this vocabulary serves political purposes that admittedly are very different from Rorty 's . In chapter 5 , I argue that two distinct purposes exist side-by-side in Rorty 's text , just as two purposes exist side-byside in mine . Rorty 's purposes are : ( a ) promoting freedom and ameliorating suffering , and ( b ) defending existing liberal democracies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) promoting freedom and ameliorating suffering , and ( c ) challenging bourgeois ideological hegemony , one contemporary instance of which is Rorty 's neoliberalism . Rorty wants to convince his readers that in order to do ( a ) one should do ( b ) ; I want to convince my readers that in order to do ( a ) one should do ( c ) . Granted , Rorty 's case for connecting ( a ) with ( b ) and my case for connecting ( a ) with ( c ) may themselves be posed largely in our respective incommensurable vocabularies . Moreover , if one focuses on ( b ) and ( c ) , the vocabulary I counterpoise to Rorty 's may be incommensurable with his . However , this does not change the fact that the brunt of my presentation is concerned with purposes and a vocabulary I have ( temporarily ! ) adopted from Rorty . Setting aside tedious debates about how to distinguish one vocabulary from another , we all admit that there is such a thing as different sets of descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless factually or logically incompatible . Surely we should not take Rorty to be saying that , in an ordinary , nontranscendental , nonphilosophical sense of the term , there is no fact of the matter whether and to what extent , say , the private sphere is a genuine refuge from state power , or whether Uncle Sam has supported more tyrants and bankrolled more bloodshed than the Kremlin , or whether the publicized aims of the founders of the Alliance for Progress ( which Rorty considers to be a salutary example of U.S. foreign policy ) were consonant with their actions and their confidential intentions . " Rorty concedes that " the world contains the causes of our being justified in holding a belief . " ' " To // hold that there is no fact of the matter when it comes to such " ordinary , retail , detailed , concrete reasons which have brought one to one 's present view " 60 is to qualify oneself as the sort of relativist Rorty has spilled much ink denying he is . " It also amounts to resorting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a widely misunderstood passage , he insisted that philosophy should leave everything as it is . Rorty might wish to write off my descriptions of the rich North Atlantic , in good " metaphilosophical relativist " 62 fashion , as one philosophical jargon among many equally good or bad jargons . To do this , however , he would have to show why my descriptions , devoid as they are of transcendental conditions and epistemological heavy breathing , constitute a philosophical attempt to " ground " a scientific explanation , a morality , or some other practice , rather than , say , part of a first-level sociological , anthropological , or historiographical theory . And I do not think he can do this convincingly . So Rorty appears to face a dilemma : If my characterization of existing liberal democracies in the following chapters is worded in a vocabulary or vocabularies commensurable with the vocabulary or vocabularies Rorty uses to defend them , then my criticisms need to be evaluated as logically or factually incompatible with Rorty 's . If , on the other hand , the vocabulary of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it is hard to imagine how anyone could ever engage Rorty in a genuine political debate . In such a case , Rorty would have indicted himself as an irrationalist , a charge against which he has protested more than once.63 So far , I have stated the problem to be taken up in this discussion , indicated what is at stake and located the problem in relation to the larger body of Rorty 's published work , his audience , and his purposes . In the next chapter , I will turn attention to Rorty 's liberal predecessors , Iircusing on his debt to Dewey and differences between the two pragmatists when it comes to their conceptions of democracy and liberty and their proposals fin- allaying the traditional opposition between the public and private . spheres . CHAPTER TWO DEPARTURES FROM DEWEY Of the three main heroes of PMN , Rorty has written that he has come to feel the closest affinity to Dewey . ' He wistfully appreciates Dewey and other engaged American philosophers of the New Deal era who played a significant role in articulating public policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . ' Like Dewey , Rorty has been concerned with defending liberal institutions in the West ? including " a free press , free universities , and enlightened public opinion , " as well as an independent judiciary and electoral representation ' ? against their intellectual detractors . Indeed , he has described himself modestly as little more than an updater of his pragmatist predecessor . ' Rorty 's self-description would appear to be accurate , at least in view of the fact that he has offered little in the way of a positive political vision that Dewey , standing on the shoulders of Mill , Jefferson , and Locke , had not already pro-45 // posed . Acknowledging this , Rorty , with equal modesty , has apologized for his " lack of imagination . " ' Dewey , then , would appear to be a reasonable point of departure for an investigation of Rorty 's social and political views . Comparing the two American pragmatists at close quarters , however , it becomes clear that Rorty is a more original thinker than his self-evaluation would lead one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One reason these differences might not be more apparent from a reading of Rorty alone is that his Dewey is , as one commentator has put it , " a surgically revised specimen , to be sure . " 6 For one thing , the two philosophers differ sharply when it comes to their conceptions of the tasks of philosophers : True , both Dewey and Rorty hold that philosophy , if it is to be anything at all , should be an attempt to see how things , in the broadest possible sense of the term , hang together , in the broadest possible sense of the term . Beyond this , however , they offer divergent views of what the scope and ends of philosophy should be . Rorty disparages defenses of liberalism that rely on high theory ? " philosophical liberalism " of the sort Kant is held to have provided . He prefers instead a defense of liberalism that casts a bright light on cornmonsense liberal beliefs , such as the belief that slavery is bad and the belief that people should be allowed to worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' " Rorty counsels , " and say that when it comes to the communal self-reassurance of the modern democratic societies , most of the work gets done not by deep thinkers ... but by superficial dreamers . " ' Recognizing this , one commentator has noted that what is unique about Rorty 's position on social and political questions is that it " manifests the insight that actually there is not much to be said that is distinctive ! ' Dewey , by contrast , had grander ends in view . As one Dewey scholar , J. E. Tiles , put it : The point of having a broad vision was for Dewey to have a vantage point from which to criticize , judiciously and sensitively , existing cultural institutions . Such criticism was for him the distinctive role of philosophy and it could not be conducted properly without an understanding of the methods of science . To mount such criticism effecDEPARTURES // tively , moreover , requires certain distortions in our conceptions of experience and of reality to be corrected , and it can not be carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals of intellectual endeavor ( such as " truth " ) and how these goals are progressively refined as our methods for pursuing them develop . ' On the same page , Tiles adds that , " All this leaves intact a great deal of what Rorty stigmatizes as Philosophy , ' and moreover presents ' Philosophy ' as instrumental to the proper conduct of philosophy . ' " If Tiles is correct , then he has made it difficult to imagine Dewey as authorizing Rorty 's view of a " postphilosophical culture " and the vision of a liberal utopia presented in CIS . Tiles casts aspersions on Rorty 's claims to Dewey 's legacy : Rorty is in the end no more prepared to take seriously and develop the philosophic position for which Dewey argued than are those who remain firmly within the analytic tradition . He is no more able to see how Dewey 's arguments might achieve what they set out to achieve than are those for whom pragmatism is " an outdated philosophical movement . " 10 Whatever the merit of Tiles 's misgivings about Rorty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public role of philosophy , however , other differences between Rorty and Dewey are more relevant to the present discussion . Two such differences are the two pragmatists ' divergent conceptions of liberty and their different attitudes toward democracy . The balance of this chapter will focus on Rorty 's debt to and departures from Dewey when it comes to their conceptions of liberty , democracy , and alternatives to the diremption of public and private persons . The first section of this chapter consists of a sketch of Dewey 's a ( ( count of the public-private split . This will prepare us in the second and third sections to appreciate Rorty 's debt to him and to take measure of the distance separating the two pragmatists on these issues . As we shall see , these differences have an important bearing on how the younger pragmatist conceptualizes and defends his brand of liberalism. // DEWEY AND THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE SPLIT In at least one important respect , Dewey shared a crucial assumption with his best-known liberal predecessors : All agreed as to the most basic constituents of society . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals : this obvious and basic fact no philosophy , whatever its pretensions to novelty , can question or alter . " " This " basic fact " notwithstanding , it is a mistake , according to Dewey , to think that humans are what they are independently of living in association with others , or to think of humans as creatures who only enter into association as a means of getting what they are quite capable of wanting regardless of whether they live socially or in isolation . Humans both make up and have been formed by " societies , associations , groups of an immense number of kinds , having different ties and instituting different interests . " ' ' To appreciate the last point more fully , it will help to be more specific about these " societies , associations , and groups . " Dewey 's inventory of latter-day examples includes gangs , criminal bands ; clubs for sport , sociability and eating ; scientific and professional organizations ; political parties and unions within them ; families ; religious denominations , business partnerships and corporations ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be local , nation-wide , and trans-national . " Of course , none of these groups and associations have existed in their present form from time immemorial . Dewey noted that defunct forms of association that existed three to four centuries ago restricted trade and shackled inquiry . " The latter point is easy to discern in the cases of , say , guilds , the apprenticeship system , and ecclesiastical education . Those who struggled against the old restrictions formulated their opposition to existing institutions by appeal to the sacred authority resident in the protesting individual . These appeals gave rise to " a theory which endowed singular persons in isolation from any associations , except those which they deliberately formed for their own ends , with native or natural rights . " " // Dewey could see no reason why the political appeal should have been to the individual 's rights rather than to the right of " some primary groupings , " except that similar battles were being fought on several fronts , religious and intellectual as well as commercial and political , and the individual was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make common cause . Thus arose the belief in " the naked individual , " to whom " all associations were foreign to his nature and rights save as they proceeded from his own voluntary choice , and guaranteed his own private ends . " ' , As shall become clear below , the activities of individual members of consensual associations figure prominently in both Dewey 's and Rorty 's characterizations of liberal communities . Nevertheless , they both opposed the picture of the " ready-made and complete individual " making choices and forming these associations , preferring instead to characterize individuals as socially produced , historically variable , and unfinished . Both pragmatists would have agreed with George Herbert Mead 's view that , at least in large part , the self is a social creation . Furthermore , Rttrty would agree with Dewey that " Individuality in a social and moral sense is something to be wrought out , " and that social arrangements , laws , and institutions are means of creating individuals . " Observing that the lines drawn between the activities of different individuals , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are redrawn as circumstances change , Dewey advised against sttetttpting to trace such lines before examining the particular historical eir tttttstances within which the public-private split is inscribed . This reasonable advice , presumably , is an instance of Dewey 's " historicism , " which IZorty applauds.18 Dewey stressed that language makes it possible for interactions to take the firm of collective actions with anticipated consequences or ends , and that these ends often inform or are present in the various stages of ' collective activity leading up to their achievement . To the extent that individuals in a group hold such ends in common , they are unurd into a group with an identity of interest . The anticipation in Ylllllnoll of particular consequences of conjoint activity , the possession a rnmmon iNtenst , " is what makes participants in a collective activity a " Wo " Uni ( y , rather than a mere aggregation of individuals who happen to // be working toward the same end without realizing it . " The planets in a constellation would form a community , " Dewey wrote , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each with those of the others and could use this knowledge to direct behavior. " 20 When such a common interest obtains , there is generated what , metaphorically , may be termed a general will and social consciousness : desires and choice on the part of individuals in behalf of activities that , by means of symbols , are communicable and shared by all concerned.21 Dewey sensibly recognized that persons more and more are joined together not so much because they have voluntarily chosen to be so united , but because " vast currents are running which bring men together . ' Still , unless and until prison inmates , refugees , or bonded laborers came together to form gangs , resistance organizations , unions , or other formally organized and more-or-less voluntary associations , he was not prepared to count them as communities . Conversely , community does not obtain when only one member of a group is aware of what events mean and manipulates them in furtherance of personal , private interests and goals . Thus , child-labor contractors , Elmer Gantrys , and imperious gurus do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wield authority do not constitute proper communities . Nor does community obtain when one member of a group forces others to surrender their interest , as in the cases of slavery , forced religious conversion , or dictatorship . To the extent that neither egregious manipulation nor forced renunciation of self-interest takes place within an organized group , however , associated life therein constitutes community life , however rudimentary . Of course , it may be futile to attempt to draw a sharp line of demarcation between voluntary and involuntary acts of association or to try to quantify coercion or consent . Although there may be no neat way to draw a line between coercion and consent , nevertheless , as Rorty has noted , " the distinction is no fuzzier than most . " As with many other things , one often can distinguish greater or lesser degrees of coercion . One way to do this , for instance , might be to compare particular cases , // with an eye to the extent to which members of a group share common ends , and the extent to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convent may be said to be less coercive than a prison . When people act in association with one another with certain ends in view , their actions often have unintended or unforeseen consequences . Sometimes these consequences , for all practical purposes , are confined only to those who share in the association . At other times , cooperative actions considerably affect people who are not directly engaged in them . Dewey tied his distinction between public and private to the distinction between people who are directly affected by some cooperative activity and others who are indirectly , but enduringly and extensively , affected by i.t.24 This distinction between public and private , it should be noted , is not the same as that between social and individual . Dewey recognized that many cooperative ( and in this sense social ) activities do not have serious indirect consequences for many people . In this sense , these activities remain merely private . On the other hand , people who are not directly engaged in a given activity often recognize that they have an interest in it . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously affected for good or evil may constitute a public. = By this account , a public comes into being as the result of the recognition of a common interest in relation to the indirect consequences of conjoint activity , notably the activities of private associations . So , for example , an association consisting of concerned residents in the vicinity of an oil refinery constitutes a public group , if they are indirecdy affected by the refinery 's operation in an enduring and extensive manner , such as , say , air quality , local tax base , or property value assessment . On the other hand , the board of directors and top echelons of management of the oil company constitute a private group directly engaged in ownership and management of the refinery . It is clear that one and the same act ? say , a decision by executive officers to increase production or to close the refinery down ? can have both a public and a private character . Furthermore , the line between lntblit and private , which is to be drawn on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of acts which are so important as to need ' ontrol , whether by inhibition or by proniotion , " 26 would appear to be highly variable . For one thing , the notion of " indirectly and seriously // affecting for good or evil " may , of course , be interrogated further : Whether or not a collective activity may be judged to affect seriously for good or evil may depend crucially on one 's final vocabulary . Jefferson 's assertion that " it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods , or no God , " 2 ' for example , clearly is at odds with the Hebrew scriptural account of the judgment of nations by a jealous God . This last illustration underscores the importance of consensus to Dewey 's vision of community , and the importance to him of a common interest or a common final vocabulary as explicitly acknowledged ties that hold the members of a public together . According to him , when individuals are not aware that they share a common interest in the indirect consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a potential public . When they are aware but lack any institutional means to control such consequences , they constitute what Dewey called an inchoate public.28 To regulate the activities that affect its interests , a proper public must have some institutional means , however rudimentary or illadapted they may be . An institution that possesses any form of organization allowing some degree of regulation of the indirect consequences of private activities constitutes a public organization . These consequences , of course , are controlled and regulated not by " the public " as " something per se , something intrinsically manifesting a general will and reason , " 29 but by individual persons acting conjointly . Those who are invested with the duty of controlling these consequences in a manner responsible to the public are officials . These officials , taken together , constitute a government , and the public thus organized thereby becomes a form of political state . " Government is not the state , " Dewey stresses , " for that includes the public as well as the rulers charged with special duties and powers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a politically organized public . It is " the organization of the public effected through officials for the protection of the interests shared by its members . " His state , moreover , is not an all-inclusive entity that incorporates the entire life of the community , as does Hegel 's state : Dewey recognizes that one may be a member of many associations , and in most instances these associations do not have consequences requiring regulation . // In chapter 3 , we will see that there is room to doubt some of the formulations in the preceding paragraphs . In the meantime , we will notice that , since Dewey defines a public in terms of indirect consequences of conjoint behavior , what public we define depends on what consequences we have in mind . Accordingly , a state conceived as the politically organized public will also depend on what consequences we have in mind . It might be noted in passing that this picture has prompted complaints to the effect that Dewey flattens out qualitatively different types of association and ties them all together under the heading " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theory of free-floating and equally graded publics might have had a certain semblance of plausibility in reference to a small trading and farming community of the nineteenth century like Burlington , Vermont Dewey 's home town ? MM , where property was more or less evenly distributed and distinctions of wealth and social standing were not too glaring . But it ignores the fundamental fact of life in the highly centralized monopoly capitalism today . " The question then arises how these various voluntary associations , c ( rntrnunities , or publics are to coexist as components of larger national communities . Dewey hoped for a community of communities or " partial publics " in which pulls and responses of different groups reinforce one another and their values accord . For him , the ideal of such a Great Community ? a community in which harmony has been achieved without coercion , manipulation , and domination ? is the idea of " ... a so ( iety in which the ever-expanding and intricately ramifying consequences of associated activities shall be known in the full sense of that word , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This ideal was intended to meet a need to resolve a conflict of interests , to find a framework of purposes that incorporates each conflicting interest and reveals thereby how far each reasonably may be pursued . It is the hope for compromise , class peace , piecemeal reform , experimentation , ? nt1 open debate . Dewey claims that his nu eption of the state and the public " gives // a criterion for determining how good a particular state is : namely , the degree of organization of the public which is attained , and the degree in which its officers are so constituted as to perform their function of caring for public interests . ' In the same essay , he acknowledges that " The forms of associated action characteristic of the present economic order are so massive and extensive that they determine the most significant constituents of the public and the residence of power . " 35 Thus , at times of widespread domestic conflict , it would seem , by Dewey 's account , that a large " constituent of the public " could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as defined by much less numerous but more " significant constituents of the public and the residence of power . " As the wave of broadly supported strikes in western Europe in 1995 and 1996 remind us , such a scenario is not entirely hypothetical , even within the rich North Atlantic democracies . Although Dewey surely did not intend it as such , his vocabulary lends itself to those who would claim that one or another state that is wellorganized enough to defeat a more numerous but less efficiently organized opposition is a good state , protecting the interests shared by its members , and thus acting in the public interest . For Dewey , as for Rorty , human communities bring together those who , by virtue of the contingency of their circumstances , happen to be susceptible to persuasion of the desirability of the community 's aims or guiding purpose . Conscious and voluntary choice , then , is a necessary ( though not a sufficient ) condition for community . It is significant that Dewey appears to view membership in an economic class not , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reference to its relationship to appropriation of the social surplus , ownership and control of means of production , or some other criterion independent of consensual association , but rather as membership in a particular community with shared ends in view . According to this view , in an era of dwindling union membership and declining support for explicitly working-class political initiatives , wage earners would constitute at most an inchoate public . Dewey 's emphasis on the consensual character of political association has important implications when we turn to the rationales he and Rorty have offered for liberalism . Before counterpoising a different DEPARTURES FROM DEWEY tt vocabulary to that which they share , we should register several sigiiili cant differences separating the two American pragmatists . DEWEY ON LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY Traditional English liberalism from Locke through Mill has rested on a fairly simple " negative " conception of liberty as freedom from the constraints of the state , conceived of as a system of public institutions . This is the liberty of classical liberalism , a liberalism that did not go much further than setting its face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with well-defined and limited powers , and at least some degree of control by the ruled . In his Two ' I ' re:ati.res of Government , Locke defined liberty as a state that an indiv idual enjoys when he is under no other legislative power but that established by consent in the commonwealth , and as the progressive elimination of the arbitrary from political and social regulation . Mill , who is often represented as one of the most consistent advocates of negative liberty , mapped the domain exempt from public intervention in broad strokes : It comprises , first , the inward domain of consciousness , demanding liberty of conscience in the most comprehensive sense , liberty of thought and feeling , absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects , practical or speculative , scientific , moral , or theological . " Ile added that " the liberty of expressing and publishing opinions " inseparable from liberty of thought itself , as is the " liberty of tastes d pursuits , of framing the plan of our life , to suit our own character , doing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " combination among indiluals , freedom to unite for any purpose not involving harm to others . " %ill 's " inward domain of consciousness , " free from political and tag legislation , corresponds to the classical liberal representation of prn ate sphere , what Isaiah Berlin called the " inviolable private re , " the domain of IZorty 's strong poets . Many liberals have viewed Inward domain of consciousness as something ; invaluable in itself , // not just as a means to anything else . For them , government regulation of the private sphere is undesirable , since it is pointless at best to regulate or interfere in activities that do not have serious indirect effects for good or evil outside the circle of a voluntary association . Although classical liberals believed , like the decidedly nonliberal Hobbes , that the liberty of particular men depends on " the silence of the Law , " they were a far cry from anarchists . Classical liberal proponents of negative liberty viewed state institutions as a necessary evil , securing what Locke called the " civil interests " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests include law and order at home , defense against foreign invasion , and security of possessions . Even Mill ? who insisted that " ... the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community , against his will , is to prevent harm to others " ? conceded that the state may invade the private domain in order to promote education , hygiene , social security , or justice . English liberals have maintained that the law can also extend the liberties of subjects by curbing and limiting the executive . Like subsequent liberals including Dewey and Rorty , they held that the law should properly reflect a public concern that the public sphere not encroach on the private sphere . Thus , they promoted laws of habeas corpus and bail , and legal restrictions on police entry and arrest . The traditional form of English political liberalism went hand in hand with the classical economic doctrine of laissez-faire . In his first inaugural address of 1801 , Locke 's most illustrious American follower summed up this doctrine in a well-known passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrain men from injuring one another , which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement , and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned . This is the sum of good government , and this is necessary to close the circle of our felicities . ' ? Although Dewey admired Jefferson , he found much with which to disagree when it came to Jefferson 's belief that that government governs // best that governs least , and to the related Lockean conception of liberty . Dewey 's differences with Locke and his followers become especially acute when it comes to the relationship between liberalism and democracy . The American philosopher acknowledged that some public institutions may involve each member of the public in every decision taken ; more commonly , however , decisions will be taken by official representatives of the public on its behalf . In either case , we have what he is prepared to call a form of political democracy . Dewey defined a democratic state as " a public articulated and operating through representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as James Mill and Bentham , viewed political democracy in this sense as one of the chief " immoderate " threats to the common weal . Locke did not propose to make the people into the governing authority , nor to raise the people to the level of coequal with the monarch ; rather , he was concerned with providing a criterion , namely collective community consent , by which to gauge the right of a political authority to rule , while at the same time providing guarantees against " the credulous superstition of the giddy multitude . " 42 Even more famously , the younger Mill identified " the tyranny of the majority " as one of his chief concerns in On Liberty . Montesquieu and the Whigs , as well as such classical liberals as Tocqueville , the Mills , and their conservative liberal successors , all warned of the danger to " the public welfare " when democracy is extended too far , in the form of universal adult suffrage . These early liberals or protoliberals , then , did not portray democracy as an end in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best-known early and classical liberals , if the governors judge democracy to be less efficacious than other means of securing the public welfare , or what Mill called the " interest and will of the nation , " they could be forgiven for limiting democracy , or jettisoning it altogether , as needs arise . In The Life and Times of Liberal Democracy , C. B. Macpherson has pointed out that liberals only began to espouse egalitarian democracy ? the sort of democracy that could be summed up by the slogan " One man one vote " ? when , well within the industrial era , it gradually became clear that extending the franchise did not threaten the propertied classes . As it has turned out , of course , representative democracy with full adult franchise has proven itself , in England , the // United States , and elsewhere , to be a particularly effective means for securing the consent of the ruled , and hence the property and prerogatives of the rich and powerful . On the eve of the French Revolution , as we know , Rousseau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers looked forward to an egalitarian democracy in which the state was not viewed as a necessary evil , but as a servant for the common well-being , an instrument of collective betterment . They embraced a conception of liberty as freedom of opportunity to develop one 's individual capacities , and they viewed the state as a positive instrument for attaining liberty thus conceived . This conception of liberty is conducive to Rousseau 's civic republicanism , Jefferson 's civic humanism , and Dewey 's " community . " The word autonomy sometimes has been used interchangeably with " liberty " so conceived . Subsequent liberals , embracing such a " positive " conception of liberty or autonomy , have portrayed participation in democratic institutions not merely as an instrument for attaining the good life , but as part of the good life itself . Like Hannah Arendt , they view citizen participation in the affairs of the political community as a characteristically free and human activity . Judging from passages such as the following , Dewey also may be counted prominently among these nonclassical liberals : Liberty is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in rich and manifold association with others : the power to be an individualized self making a distinctive contribution and enjoying in its own way the fruits of association " Reading this passage in the light of what has already been said about Dewey 's conception of the public , it becomes clear that what is described here is not the negative liberty of the classical liberals , the freedom of the individual from the state , but something more akin to the Rousseauians ' positive liberty . Furthermore , Dewey distinguished between political democracy as a system of government and democracy as what he called a " social idea . " As he explained , // The idea of democracy is a wider and fuller idea than can be exempli-fied in the state even at its best . To be realized it must affect all modes of human association , the family , the school , industry , religion ' Regarded as an idea , the author states , democracy is not an alternative to other principles of associated life . Rather , as Dewey put it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' There are ways to draw a connection between liberty and democ-racy without invoking the notion of autonomy in the public sphere According to a familiar liberal rationale for American-style representa-tive democracy , for example , experience has taught us that unless there are some widely accepted and enforceable constraints on individua behavior , individuals , each pursuing her or his own irreducibly unique vision of personal perfection , are likely to come into conflict with one another . Thus , individuals find they must have some form of recognized government to adjudicate and ameliorate conflicts among private par-ties , for the good of the larger public . Unfortunately , people in positions of authority , including government officials , have an advantage over others when it comes to procuring the means to realize their nonpolit-ical , private aspirations and aims , while those without authority may find their aspirations thwarted by venal magistrates who take advantage of their positions . Thus , leaving institutions of government in the hands of people who do not have to answer for what they do invites abuse . The most effective way so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions of government answer ultimately to everyone When everyone is subject to the same constraints , at least formally , and those constraints are enforced by authority widely deemed to be answerable to everyone equally , the governed recognize themselves in the government , or at the very least do not consider government to be hostile or externally imposed . Under such a regime of political democ-racy , government takes place peacefully , with the consent , however pas-sive or tacit , of the governed . Political democracy , thus conceived , is an instrument for resolving conflicts between individuals pursuing their own private aims , and liberty is the classical liberal freedom from excel-site government . 11 hatever the merits of . this rationale , Dewey rejected it . " ' In con60 RICHARD RORTY 'S POLITICS trast to many of his liberal predecessors , he viewed participation in democratic institutions not as a mere means to an end , but as something intrinsically good , and good not only for the community as a whole , but for each individual member of the community : For Dewey , public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being not only a responsible citizen , but also a fulfilled private individual . As he put it , Law , state , church , family , friendship , industrial association , these and other institutions and arrangements are necessary in order that individuals may grow and find their specific capacities and functions " Dewey is well known for having viewed elementary education as a creative experience in its own right , rather than exclusively as a preparation for adulthood . Similarly , he viewed participation in democratic institutions as an autonomous activity in its own right . In this respect , then , the inextricably related institutions of democratic participation and public education are as much components or instances of the good life as they are instruments for attaining it . By participating in these and other noncoercive public institutions and identifying herself with policy , the individual-as-citizen becomes a person more securely in possession of capacities and resources that these institutions have helped to foster . Since , as we shall see , Dewey 's evaluation of public life contrasts sharply with Rorty 's , it is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state is a good state , when the officers of the public genuinely serve the public interest , this reflex effect is of great importance . It renders the desirable associations solider and more coherent ; indirectly it clarifies their aims and purges their activities . It places a discount upon injurious groupings and renders their tenure of life precarious . In performing these services , it gives the individual members of valued associations greater liberty and security : it relieves them of hampering conditions which if they had to cope with personally would absorb their energies in mere negative struggles against evils . It enables individual members to count with reasonable certainty upon what others will do , and thus facilitates mutually helpful cooperations . It creates respect for others and for one 's self . A measure of the goodDEPARTURES FROM DEWEY r.I ness of a state is the degree in which it relieves individuals from the waste of negative struggle and needless conflict and confers upon him positive assurance and reinforcement in what he undertakes . This is a great service , and there is no call to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action which states have historically effected " Dewey disputed the view of means and ends that permits us to treat public democratic institutions merely as external means adopted to ensure a fulfilled private life . According to him , the relationship between means and ends , as they are hit upon , refine and enlarge ends . Ends are not pregiven : They are constituted in the course of pursuing means . Nor are there " genuine " or " authentic " ends , in view of which all means , past , present , and future , may be evaluated with respect to how conducive they are to realizing those ends . Dewey urged us to treat our ends as open , so that our means can become " genuine instruments " ? that is , constituents of our ends . Participation in democratic institutions constitutes a particularly important body of shared experience which , in turn , bolsters those institutions , extending and deepening democratic participation . Treating our ends as open helps us to adapt to the contingencies of our existence , thereby helping us to act freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means and ends on the one hand and freedom on the other appears to be tenuous , this is because of a set of presuppositions underlying the familiar rationale , presuppositions that he viewed as distortions of important facts . These presuppositions represent individual human selves and what they desire at something given , something already there . These givens then function as absolute constraints on inquiry , which in turn give rise to fruitless conceptions of our relationships as individuals to political institulions and the larger communities of which we are a part . Thus , for example , debates about psychological egoism versus altruism , about whether or not people always or usually pursue their self-interests and what those self-interests are , quickly lead into familiar philosophical col de-sacs . Recognizing this , one I ) cwey scholar has noted that , // The individualism of " classic Liberalism " has bequeathed to us an opposition between self-regarding and other-regarding , egoism and altruism , neither of which is satisfactory and between which we should not feel we have to choose 4B Dewey refused to enter into such debates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antithesis of the Individual and Social , and the problem of their reconciliation . " 50 For him , as the previously cited source noted , The choice is not between a self-regarding person and an otherregarding person , but between a person whose regard for self is regard for something narrow , trivial , transient and exclusive , and a person whose regard for self is for something wide and inclusive enough to embrace the interests of other people and permanent and significant enough to flourish only in an environment sustained by shared values and cooperative actions ' As we have seen , Dewey 's conception of liberty as autonomy , and his evaluation of democratic participation and public education as ends in themselves , represent significant departures from classical liberalism . In few other places is this departure clearer than in his refusal to endorse the opposition of public and private persons . On the other hand , Dewey 's use of key terms such as interest , government , political state , and political democracy is not noticeably inconsistent with Rorty 's vocabulary . The same is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rorty 's question , cited above , " Which communities ' purposes should I share ? " And , as we shall see , Rorty agrees with Dewey insofar as both rejected descriptions of the narrowly self-regarding egoist and the exclusively other-regarding citizen as irreconcilable opponents . In the following pages , however , it should become clear that Rorty 's way of averting the clash of public and private persons differs significantly from Dewey 's . It should also become clear how much weight the public and private spheres must bear as repositories of altruism and egoism , respectively , to sustain Rorty 's view . // RORTY ON LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY One well-known controversy among classical liberals concerned J. S. Mill and his father , James Mill . The younger Mill came to feel that the liberalism of Bentham and the elder Mill one-sidedly focused on " external culture " ? reason and truth ? and did not take proper account of " internal culture " ? the individual 's feelings , passions , impulses , natural inclinations , and idiosyncrasies . The author of On Liberty was convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prevailing opinion and feeling , " as well as the tyranny of magistrates . His reaction was to insist on reserving as large a space as possible exempt from the intervention of magistrates and the majority . This space is Mill 's " appropriate region of human liberty , " which we encountered in the previous section . J. S. Mill 's liberal successors have thought of themselves as standing in defense of individuality and self-creation , of maximizing and defending the region of individual liberty against others , whether singly or organized as governments or nongovernmental associations . At the same time , however , liberals have also stood for the containment of individuality and self-creation . Thus , for liberals like Benjamin Constant , the task of liberalism is to protect against personal politics and the chaos of unconstrained self-expression . Like Mill , Rorty also prizes idiosyncrasy and individuality , as well as the idea that freedom creates room for self-creation , as ideals that his liberal utopia is bound to count as its chief purpose . For Rorty , as for till , freedom from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pursuit of one 's self-perfection . Consider , for example , Rorty 's approving description of Dewey : Iie assumed that no good achieved by earlier societies would be worth recapturing if the price were a diminution in our ability to leave people alone , to let them try out their private visions of perfection in peace . Ile admired the American habit of giving democracy priority over philosophy by asking , about any vision of the meaning of life , " Would not acting out this vision interfere with the ability of others to work out their own salvation ? " ' ' // According to Mill 's " one very simple principle , " " The sole end for which mankind are warranted , individually or collectively , in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection . " 53 Rorty would agree with Mill that the authority of law should intervene only when it becomes clear that one person 's pursuit of private perfection is interfering extralinguistically with another 's ? only when strong poets and revolutionaries make life harder for others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ideal liberal community is one in which ... the only sort of human liberty which is hoped for is Isaiah Berlin 's negative liberty ' ? being left alone . ' Like many liberals since Constant , however , Rorty also worries about the dangers of one-sidedly focusing on this ideal . These dangers are not limited to whatever cost the community may have to bear for withdrawal or aloofness from public affairs on the part of aesthetes and visionaries . Strong poets may well pose a greater threat when they make politics an arena for heroic or messianic self-display . By placing inordinate or exclusive emphasis on individual self-assertion , we invite into the public arena passionate visionaries intent on realizing their utopian obsessions by any means necessary ( to borrow an expression popularized by one such visionary in the second half of the twentieth century ) . Like Plato , St. Paul , and Kant , Marx allegedly tried in his own way to produce a single vocabulary capable of serving two different purposes , namely making oneself a new creature and establishing justice on Earth.55 And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the envy of all later intellectual movements because it seemed , for a moment , to show how to synthesize self-creation and social responsibility , pagan heroism and Christian love , the detachment of the contemplative with the fervor of the revolutionary.56 Marxist revolutionaries , and other revolutionaries besides , have viewed the public sphere as an arena within which to do two things simultaneously : In the course of building the revolution , the revolutionaries reinvent themselves in the image of the New Socialist Man . " The discontent of messianic radicals , " as Yack describes it , DEPARTURES FROM DEWEY is so intense partly because they believe that the redemption of thc world hastens their own redemption . The fate of the institutions thus hate determines the success of their pursuit of psychic health . ' I'lic destruction of the old order redeems their souls as it cleanses the world . The end of the old world ends their dissatisfaction with themselves. = ' Dr. Wolfgang Huber , of the Psychiatric Neurological Clinic of Heidelberg University , provided a caricature of this view when , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the so-called BaaderMeinhof gang ) , he counseled his patients to " Bomb for mental health ! " After herculean efforts in this century , however , attempts thus to fuse public and private aims have ended in debacle . Self-proclaimed Marxist regimes in the East have either collapsed in the face of popular discontent or , as in the case of China , have thoroughly capitulated , if not to Western-style democracy , then to the profit motive and the " free market " This record of failure in practice is the best argument against attempting to fuse public and private aims in theory . Accordingly , Rorty urges us to stop looking for a successor to Marxism , for a theory which fuses decency and sublimity . Ironists should reconcile themselves to a private-public split within their final vocabularies , to the fact that resolution of doubts about one 's final vocabulary has nothing in particular to do with attempts to save other people from pain and humiliation.58 As Constant 's heirs are quick to point out , the means visionaries in the public sphere have deemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the self-creative acts of others . This is why Nancy Rosenblum has claimed that the romantic sensibility is ttule under no other system but liberalism , with its " regular and pacific liberty . " s ? When politics becomes the terrain of sublimity , narcissism , and the romantic impulse to make it new , and visionary self-asserters rr tempted to merge politics and sublimity , then large numbers of ople may be swept up into the romance of history and deposited at r slaughter bench . Thus , where private projects conflict with miniiaing the possibility of humiliation , these projects should be privatftrd , depoliticized. // Rorty 's examples of dangerous self-asserters prominently includes such " nonpoets " as Lenin , Stalin , Hitler , and Mao.h ? The list is noticeably skewed against Uncle Sam 's betes noires , and at least one commentator views Lenin 's inclusion on it as little more than a gratuitous anti-Marxist political gesture . " In spite of misgivings about his choice of illustrations , however , Rorty 's warning is clear enough : When the aesthetic obsessions of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the chief values in public discourse , the stage is set for evitable cruelty on a grand scale . For Rorty , as for Dewey , thinking of oneself as a member of a community is a necessary part of being a member of a community . Rorty has defined a liberal community as one with no ideal or purpose other than making life easier on strong poets , allowing them to continue to change language In this way he registers his concern with averting the tyranny of the majority . It is difficult to imagine any additional ideal or purpose ( with the possible exception of protection of property rights ) , whether emanating from a public or a private impulse , which would not at least to some extent encroach on Mill 's " internal culture . " Accordingly , Rorty has sometimes defined a liberal community as " one which has no purpose except freedom , " " the freedom that makes room for self-creation . On other occasions , however , he has defined a liberal as a person for whom cruelty is the worst thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or private , is more important than ameliorating suffering . Despite manifest problems with utilitarianism , he sees no better way of stating duty to others than the greatest happiness principle . Vocabularies of public decency in the West are concerned with the alleviation of cruelty , most notably with that peculiarly human form of cruelty , humiliation , or " forced redescription . " In Rorty 's book , ameliorating this sort of cruelty is the defining ideal of liberals.6 ' This manner of putting things underscores his emphasis on the efficacy of linguistic practices , sometimes at the expense of nondiscursive causal processes . At times , this emphasis has resulted in far-fetched formulations , exemplified by his endorse ment of " a Whitmanesque sense that our democratic community is held together by nothing less fragile than social hope . By philosopher Nancy Fraser 's lights , Rorty at one time made the case that these two ideals , making the world safe fir strong poets and // ameliorating suffering , complement each other : The romantic poet and the pragmatic reformer are " natural partners . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures encourage us to cease pinning our hopes on God , reason , human nature , and the moral law , and in this way they direct us away from objectivity to ungrounded soli darity , to clinging together against the night . By redescribing our situa - tion in various and unfamiliar ways , strong poets teach us to view life as a tissue of contingencies , ourselves as finite , and liberal institutions as fragile human inventions . This earlier Rorty , according to Fraser , has emphasized that we only see the practices of earlier ages as cruel and unjust because the poets have taught us how to redescribe them using metaphors and vocabularies they invented . Moreover , by redescrihing and re-redescribing hitherto familiar objects , they teach us tolerance of alternative perspectives and accommodation to the opinions of our fellow citizens . In this light , the freezing-over of culture is a threat to a far broader constituency than just romantic intellectuals . " Thus , by making society safe for strong poets , we make it safe for everyone except perhaps those who aspire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's views on the usefulness of the romantic poet to liberal democracy may be too tidy : Even in more recent work he sounds in some respects like an advocate of the " natural part hers " view " In any case , events since the collapse of the Berlin Wall have brought home very graphically the dangers posed when romantic poets in Russia , the Baltic republics , the Caucasus , Central Asia , the former Yugoslavia and , yes , even the Czech Republic ? are propelled into high political office . Not so long ago Rorty wrote that " ... in contemporary Russia and Poland , poets , playwrights and novelists serve as the best examples of certain ... moral virtues . " " As soon as the former dissident novelists and poets became the acknowledged legislators of the social world , however , the result has often been tyranny and misery worse than worst of their immediate " nonpoet " predecessors . In the course of a short years , the Gamsekhurdias , Sharanskys , and EIchibeys , the Karadthe Talibanis , and a long list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramscian sense of the word iumrl/eeitiaf have embezzled big Nis of dollars , expelled or imprisoned a new generation of dissidents , indicated the cruelest forms of rmsogvnv , bulldozed homes , tortured // and killed detainees , assassinated political opponents , pauperized tens of millions of their compatriots , turned millions of others into refugees , and presided over ethnic-cleansing campaigns in a dozen locales , from Tajikistan to the Trans-Dniester . Examples could be multiplied almost at will . Not even Rorty 's liberal hero Vaclav Havel has remained unsullied : The playwright and first president of the Czech Republic has given his imprimatur to repressive legislation that was objectionable even to the editors of the Wall Street7ournal , who complained that he " ... just signed a new law calling for up to two years in prison for anyone convicted of defaming ' the government , parliament or the constitutional court . " " Developments since the early 1990s , then , have made it ever more difficult to view cultural innovators and seekers of social justice as " natural partners . " By Rorty 's lights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means by which bright youth gain a self-image . " ' ? Even before it became clear to the syndicated columnists that the balance of power in Eastern Europe had irreversibly shifted in favor of Bonn and Washington , D.C. , he had come to discern what Fraser has described as a " selfish , ' antisocial motive in Romanticism , one that represents the very antithesis of communal identification . " On the one hand , as Mill has reminded us , solely focusing on the public welfare or the greater good can lead to the tyranny of the majority and Rorty 's " freezing-over of culture . " On the other hand , as we have seen , the romantic impulse to make it new , when unleashed in public , can lead to evitable pain and humiliation . Thus , to take either public welfare or selfcreation alone and elevate that single ideal to the status of sole definitive purpose of a liberal community is to invite disaster . One of the most difficult tasks of liberal utopians is to negotiate some sort of modus vivendi for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To claim , as Rorty does , that freedom for self-assertion and allevia Lion of cruelty both deserve equal claim to our allegiance , while at the same time acknowledging that there is a constant tension between the two , is entirely in keeping with a long-standing self-image of liberals as promoters of tolerance and compromise . Like Constant , Rorty can think of no better way to achieve a compromise between equal opportunity and the freedom that makes room fir self making than to distinguish carefully between private and public spheres of life as the sphere ! // of altruism and self-perfection , respectively . As he emphasizes , with reference to his book CIS , The core of my book is a distinction between private concerns , in the sense of idiosyncratic projects of self-overcoming , and public concerns , those having to do with the suffering of other human beings . " The distinction between public and private concerns , Rorty hastens to add in the same note , is emphatically not " the distinction between the domestic hearth and the public forum , between oiko.r and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space within which idiosyncratic projects of self-overcoming take place , and the public sphere is the realm of shared concerns of the community . For the latter-day Rorty of what Fraser calls the " partition position , " it is imperative to keep these two spheres apart . It is not surprising , therefore , that he envisions political institutions that will foster public indifference to such issues as theology and metaphysics , the nature of the self , the nature of God , the point of human existence , and the meaning of life , while putting no restriction on private discussion of them . " These most precious liberal institutions include the institutions we have already mentioned : independent judiciaries , free universities , a free press , and so on . ' " A liberal democracy will not only exempt opinions on such matters as theology , metaphysics , and the meaning of life from legal coercion , but will also aim at disengaging discussions of such questions from discussions of social policy . In this respect , he is indeed ? continuator of Jefferson , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon or modify opinions on matters of ultimate importance , the opinions that may hitherto have given sense and point to their lives , if these opinions entail public actions that can not be justified to most of their fellow citizens . " Part of the originality of Rorty 's position is his use of an antiessenlut vocabulary to defend . Jefferson 's compromise between an indiIual 's opinions on matters of ultimate importance and her public auras . The best- if not the only ? way to ensure that the romantic // urge for " total revolution " remains unavailable for political exploitation is to ensure that the ideal of noninterference with the self-creation of strong poets will not be the one and only purpose of a community , but to temper it with the ideal of ameliorating suffering . And a good way to check the tyranny of the majority is to promote the freedom that makes room for self-making . It is not surprising , then , that in Rorty 's liberal utopia , the optimal political synthesis of love and justice may turn out to be what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narcissism and public pragmatism . " 76 It is , of course , unremarkable for the decent citizen and the strong poet to be combined within one and the same biography : If , as Whitman put it , " I contain multitudes " ? many selves , more or less transient and incomplete ? we may expect that members of liberal communities typically will comprise both public and private selves . Furthermore , as we have seen , it is possible and desirable to imagine a liberal utopia that would serve both figures . This utopia would place no ideal higher than the pursuit of self-perfection and the amelioration of suffering . Moreover , thanks to the public/private split , there would be no need , within such a utopia , to elevate one of these two ideals above the other . Despite occasional appearances to the contrary , then , Rorty refuses to define a liberal community ? that is , a public in the broadest sense of the word ? in terms of one overarching goal ( such as , say , the glorification of God , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for self-making ) . This reluctance , presumably , is a feature of his " pluralism . " Instead , he upholds the idea of a community that strives after both intersubjective agreement and novelty . To strive for intersubjective agreement on the need to ameliorate cruelty is to seek liberal consensus , in Shklar 's sense of the word " liberal . " To strive for consensus , when it comes to granting every private self unlimited freedom of opportunity to produce novel tropes , is to strive to ameliorate humiliation in the public sphere , while at the same time promoting toleration of humiliation in words , but not in deeds , in the private sphere . Rorty praises Howe for having taught , during his editorship of Dissent , " how one could combine the contemplative and the active lives without trying to synthesize the two . " He advocates abandoning the invariably unsuccessful attempt to devise an algorithm for determining from case to // case which ideal will prevail . In the utopian future this task of determination will have to take place as it has in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need arises , with the institutions and practices at hand . The closest thing to a guideline he proffers is his recommendation that the strong poet not be hindered from striving as much as he likes for self-perfection ? as long as he does it on his own time . In an interview , he sloganized this ideal as follows : " Always strive to excel , but only on weekends . " Rorty insists on the radical separation of the public and private spheres . Referring to historicist writers concerned with private perfection and those concerned with promoting more just and free human communities , he writes : We shall only think of these two kinds of writers as opposed if we think that a more comprehensive philosophical outlook would let us hold self-creation and justice , private perfection and human solidarity , in a single vision.79 Rorty , of course , is at the farthest remove from those who have held that the private ideal of self-creation and the public-spirited ideal of greatest happiness for the greatest number are realizations of eternally pregiven potentialities latent in humankind , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reformation , the French Revolution , or the Romantic movement . For him , these and all other ideals , purposes , and goals are historically and culturally specific discursive productions . Since his antiessentialism prohibits him from positing a genuine human essence to be expressed , repressed , or liberated , these goals have no lintndation in universal reason . Rorty can not imagine what a non-question-begging argument in favor of these ideals would be like : They have long been part of a form of life prevailing in the North Atlantic , and as such they are elements of what it is to be us . Contemporary inhabitants of liberal democracies would be inclined to dismiss anyone who would deny these ideals ? in words , if not in deeds ? as irrational , rather than taking them seriously . " ? To deny these ideals ? again , in words , but not necessarily in deeds ? is just not the way things are done around here . lorcov-er , Rorty adds , public debate should not problematize these ideals . If there is one thing one should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is such ideals of justice . To the extent that ironism is the stock-in-trade of the strong poet , this returns us to the injunction to exclude the strong poet from the public square . And , to the extent that the strongest theorists are ironist theorists , Rorty concludes that political theory is not very useful to contemporary liberals . ' For the mature Rorty of Fraser 's " partition position , " all attempts to merge public altruism with private egoism into one all-encompassing theory are either futile or inadvisable or both . The separation of public and private persons , of public altruism and private sublimity , should also be a separation in " theory . " In the absence of a universal essence that members of a community share , an essence that can bridge the public/private split , it is futile to try to do justice to these two figures , decent citizen and strong poet , within one integrated theory , or to try , as the stoics and their successors have tried , to combine inward tranquillity and duty to others within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt is ill-conceived at the outset . Since , as we have seen , Rorty denies the value of any notion of human nature independent of what our latest vocabularies put in play , there can be no such thing as grounding a human community in a correct view of human nature . If the notions of an intrinsic human nature from which to be alienated and of authentic needs to be fulfilled fall by the wayside , then it is pointless to reproach institutions and practices because they allegedly defy this nature or these needs . " By Rorty 's nominalist lights , language amounts to little more than human beings using marks and noises to get what they want . One of the things we human beings want to get with language , in addition to food , shelter , and sex , is an enhanced sense of solidarity with other humans ; still another may be to create or enlarge oneself by developing one 's own private , autonomous language . The latter two items are distinct purposes , proper to public and private concerns , respectively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a picture of the self as a space of self-elaboration which can freely generate new self-interpretations ? and hence new ways of being human ? by creating new vocabularies , new forms of " abnormal discourse . " On the other hand , our community-oriented sense of being " one of us " is backed tip by the recognition that abnormal discourse is // possible only at the margins , only against a background of normal discourse that defines our shared identity . These observations have prompted Rorty to conclude that his own antiessentialist vocabulary is more useful to contemporary liberalism than the essentialist rhetoric of natural rights , reason , and so on , which has hitherto been associated with liberalism . As we have seen , it is not very useful to theorize liberalism , to ground it in a correct view of human nature ; however , it is useful to articulate liberalism , to make it attractive to the next generation , not by pretending to ground political practices but by expressing political hopes . When it is possible to bring together elements of a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how rational agreement can be reached on what would settle the issue on every point where statements seem to conflict , Rorty describes these elements , in terminology he borrows from Thomas Kuhn , as commensurable . Normal and abnormal discourses are incommensurable . Rorty 's claim that the private vocabularies of strong poets and abnormal discoursers are incommensurable with the public vocabularies of decent reformers allows him to deny the necessity of placing one ideal above the other , or claiming that one reduces to the other or logically entails the other . For this reason , he agrees with Dewey that we should not feel we have to choose between public altruism and private egoism , in the form of the striving for self-creation . In contrast to his best-known liberal predecessor , however , he believes both are satisfactory , as long as laissez-faire and individualism are reserved for the private sphere , and equality , democracy , and solidarity are reserved for the public sphere . Normal discourse , Rorty continues , is discourse in which commensuration works . This happens when both parties to a conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abnormal discourse , by contrast , occurs in periods of transition from one theory to another . In this transitional or " revolutionary " stage , old terms take on unfamiliar meanings and new words are introduced . Public discourse , the discourse of the dutiful citizen , or discourse which is useful for ameliorating suffering , is incommensurable with private discourse , the discourse of the strong poet seeking selfperfection. // To conflate the two sorts of vocabularies is to run together two distinct language games . Rorty illustrates this with reference to Nabakov 's disdain for Orwell : The Englishman might or might not have tried and failed to fuse decency with sublimity in his writing . What he is rightly praised for , however ? and what appears to have made little impression on Nabakov ? was the manner in which he brought our attention to evitable suffering , and in particular , to officially sanctioned humiliation . Similar misunderstandings abound on the other side , too , as when engaged writers condemn their aestheticist colleagues as irresponsible for describing the color of the dying man 's lips.83 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though we have to choose between either the role of a community-spirited , dutiful public person or a narcissistic private person . Like Dewey , the younger pragmatist rejects the hoary antithesis of the individual and the social . He disagrees with Dewey , however , when it comes to the attempt to break down the distinction between duty to self and duty to others , the private and the public imperatives , respectively . Dewey 's attempt , described toward the end of the previous section , is characteristic of a long-standing tradition in social philosophy since Plato , a tradition which sees the polis as man writ large 84 By Rorty 's account , however ; one of Dewey 's illustrious contemporaries showed us how to break with this tradition : Freud gave up Plato 's attempt to bring together the public and the private , the parts of the state and the parts of the soul , the search for social justice and the search for individual perfection .... He distinguished sharply between a private ethic of self-creation and a public ethic of mutual accommodation . He persuades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universally shared beliefs or desires ? beliefs or desires which belong to us qua human and which unite us to our fellow humans simply as human.85 Pragmatists , in contrast to Plato 's heirs , promote the use of both vocabularies of private self-creation and vocabularies of public welfare , without trying to reduce the one to the other . Accordingly , Rorty proposes a division of labor that a sympathetic commentator has described as follows : // The scientists , technicians , and engineers , with the exception of those very few who are able to serve as paradigms of self-creation , are accorded the task of easing the pains of social existence ; the poet and novelist are to provide new vocabularies which can serve as models of private perfection . " Rorty 's assignment of distinct stations and duties to public and private persons allows him to shunt the dutiful citizen and the divine egoist off to separate and incommensurable spheres . In the course of so doing , he boldly redraws the line between altruism and egoism that Dewey tried to efface . Of course , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same body : One and the same biography may contain the story of a dutiful citizen , concerned with ameliorating pain and humiliation of his fellows , and the story of a strong poet , striving for personal perfection . Moreover , he does not deny that private obsessions occasionally coincide with public needs ; on the contrary , he acknowledges that when a private fantasy finds an audience , the result is sometimes great art.87 Nevertheless , he does deny the assumption that duty to others and duty to self can or should be combined into one multipurpose normative vocabulary , that self-creation and justice can be brought together at the level of philosophical theory . Rorty agrees with Dewey that there need not be any opposition between duty to self and duty to others , but he differs with his predecessor when it comes to the manner in which he wishes to avert this opposition . As we have seen , the elder pragmatist believed that public education and democratic participation could and should play a decisive role in promoting a broader , more inclusive , and permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with common interests of a larger public . Rorty also wants a more inclusive ethno.r , nevertheless , he does not challenge the continuity of narrow individualism . Ile merely urges us to keep the romantic desire for self-creation and " total revolution " out of the public domain , out of politics . He Associates those who yearn fir revolutionary movements , both political end ultural , with self-surrender and the sell-deceptive slogan : " Not my will , but the movement 's , be thine " " Rorty wishes to shunt self-assertion // and narcissism to the private sphere , while holding that " we consciousness " is more appropriate to the public sphere . The exceptions ? tiny circles of kindred souls involved in the same private projects as we are ourselves ? only prove the rule , by virtue of their isolation and elitism . Rorty also differs from his pragmatist mentor when it comes to their respective conceptions of autonomy . As we have seen , Dewey denied that autonomy is something that all human beings have within them and that society can release by ceasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is indeed waiting at the end of the road Michel Foucault was treading . " Nevertheless , Dewey held that public institutions , notably public schools and democratic institutions , should be viewed as " genuine instruments " for creating individuals with more inclusive common interests , and hence a stronger " we consciousness . " This conviction contrasts sharply with Rorty 's . " We consciousness , " for the younger pragmatist , is principally a public concern , not a private one . If you accept the distinction between the public and the private realms which I draw in Contingency , Irony , and Solidarity , then the question of which kind of human being you want to become will divide into two subquestions . The first is : with what communities should you identify , of which should you think of yourself as a member ? The second is ... : what should I do with my aloneness ? 90 Autonomy , the sort of thing some people actually achieve in their aloneness and on their own time , is a private concern , not a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nietzsche , Derrida , or Foucault seek is not the sort of thing that could ever be embodied in social institutions . Autonomy is not something which all human beings have within them and which society can release by ceasing to repress them . It is something which certain particular human beings hope to attain by self-creation , and which a few actually do . The desire to be autonomous is not relevant to the liberal 's desire to avoid cruelty and pain ? a desire which Foucault shared , even though he was unwilling to express it in those terms . " ' // For Rorty , then , autonomy is private autonomy , autonomy synonymous with self-creation . Autonomy is something self-creators in the private sphere seek to achieve , and that some rare individuals actually do achieve . Such rare individuals are the results of incalculable contingencies , accidents , and cosmic rays scrambling neurons . This being the case , public institutions can not embody autonomy and should not be expected to do so . Participation in democratic institutions and public life has no special place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this respect , too , he differs from Dewey . David Hall has noted that , compared to Dewey , Rorty 's democratic sentiments or , at least , his democratic expectations ) are seriously qualified . Democracy is the vehicle for the rise in the minimum standards of life ? increased freedom and autonomy . But the freedom is a formal freedom , empty in the sense that only a very few will be able to exercise it in a meaning creating and , therefore , meaningful manner . And the autonomy is , for most , a blind autonomy , unguided by a sense of relevance.92 For Rorty , as for Hegel and Sidney Hook , democracy , nowadays , is little more than one of the most efficient ways of selecting candidates liar government office and conferring legitimacy on them . It should not be surprising , then , that Rorty would describe his democratic utopia , uninspiringly enough , as one in which " the quest for autonomy is impeded as little as possible by social institutions . " ? As we have seen in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their respective views on autonomy , liberty , and democracy . These differences have to do with the very different manners in which I1 the two American pragmatists view the relationship between the public and the private . For Dewey , public institutions , notably public education and democratic institutions , are indispensable from the perspective of positive liberty or autonomy , as he used these words . Rorty , on the other // hand , has reverted to a classical liberal conception of private autonomy and liberty as exemption from state intervention . Autonomy , for him , does not entail merely a duty to self , but a duty to self that , even at those copacetic moments when it happens to coincide with duty to others , is necessarily in contrast to others . Though Rorty might refuse the neoliberal tag , he ? like other contemporary neoliberals , but unlike Dewey ? views democracy not as an end in itself , but as a means for securing other ends . In Rorty 's case , as we have seen , these ends are amelioration of suffering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that Dewey 's vision of democratic community advances liberal ideals suffices to legitimize it . We have noted that Rorty subscribes to the idea that freedom makes room for self-making . But what of the freedom from want and humiliation which is the concern of his decent , dutiful citizen in the public sphere ? Thugs and the secret police , obviously , are impediments to this freedom . So are corporate managements that promote " lean production , " thereby eliminating the leisure time and energy required for self-creation and autonomy . In the latter case , it is clear that some of Rorty 's celebrated " institutions of large market economies " stand in the way of freedom v4 Rorty recognizes this , of course , but can think of no better remedy than constant adjustment and compromise between state intervention and the market . He also acknowledges more than once that poverty is an impediment to autonomy . Nevertheless , his stress on the role of one particular liberal institution , the institution of " large market economies , " in promoting freedom has prompted one sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his discussion of political theory some reflections upon the relationship between liberal democracies and their economic determinants .... Rorty 's failure to treat these issues in any argumentative detail makes his reflections on political life seem somewhat detached . Viewed in the light of his endorsement of the idea that " cruelty is the worst thing we do , " his programmatic interests come off as rather thinly urgent at best B ' We will return to the question of Rorty 's programmatic interest in ameliorating suffering in chapter 4 . Before that , however , we should // turn our attention to his defense of liberal institutions with reference to the ideal of impeding the quest for autonomy as little as possible . This will be the focus of the next chapter . CHAPTER THREE FREEDOM AND LIBERALISM IN PRACTICE One of the most common representations of modern states ? a representation that has gained even more force since the proclaimed end of the cold war ? depicts political power chafing at an external limit posed by the private sphere . As I indicated in the previous chapter , Rorty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private sphere and political authority . This is most evident when , as we have seen , he celebrates existing liberal democracies as setups which " leave people alone , to let them try out their private isions of perfection in peace . " ' This conventional model may have been an accurate picture of the relationship between the private sphere and political authority in Eastern Europe in the final years of the cold war ; however , I will argue in this chapter that it is not an accurate representation of the state of al lairs in the rich North Atlantic . In the latter case , as the sanctity of the private sphere has been proclaimed ever more vociferously , the scope of HS // surveillance , regulation , and control by agencies of political authority has become ever more efficient and has extended ever further into the private sphere . One account of the latter development immediately presents itself : The accessibility of private life to surveillance and control by state agencies requires a relatively high level of development of information collection , retrieval , and management , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of technological development and centralization of economic practices . A medieval king in his castle can not make decisions about how his peasant subjects will live when he has no way of even knowing how many subjects he has , or where they live , let alone their birth and death rates and levels of productivity . As Marx pointed out , it is capitalism that first develops the forces and relations of production in ways that make a high degree of centralized control possible . Since Poland or Russia , with their " precapitalist " economies , lacked much of " the power that modern technology makes available to thugs , " z it is unsurprising that regimes there would not have been able to mount the sort of massive invasions and manipulations that are standard operating procedure in , say , Germany , Japan , and the United States . This account , of course , has more than an element of truth to it . Certainly , simple access to the technical means of surveillance and manipulation will go a long way in accounting for the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly a U.S. cold war ally that , until the end of the Najibullah regime in Kabul , was a beneficiary of relatively unimpeded computer technology transfers ? as compared with Pakistan 's erstwhile " nonaligned " neighbor to the east . A narrowly technological account of the expansion of state control , however , ignores problems that should not be ignored . For one thing , by portraying innovations in the technologies of surveillance and control as more or less unilaterally determining the scope of state intervention , we risk understating the role of state institutions in promoting or squelching the large-scale deployment of certain technologies . In a state such as the former Soviet Union , for example ? where guards were posted at fax machines , where telephone directories were classified secrets , and where mimeograph machines , photocopiers , and even typewriters were required to be registered with one or another ministry ? it // is not surprising that the productivity of labor would have fallen far below that of the advanced capitalist economies , and that citizens would be deprived of consumer goods and services available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastation of the Second World War , there were at least three reasons for the lack of development and widespread application of these new technologies in the Soviet Union : ( a ) a technology and trade embargo enforced by the West deprived the Soviet Union of credit , foreign capital and labor and consumer markets , and of the opportunity to emulate Japan , the Six Tigers of the Pacific Rim , or China , whose nascent high-tech industries have relied in large part on copying foreign designs ; ( b ) a constant push to increase the productivity of labor through automation would only have made it harder to maintain the charade of constitutionally guaranteed full employment ; and ( c ) new technologies , notably telecommunications and computers , fueled the official fear of the dissident press , the samizdat , the audience for which was burgeoning ? thanks in large part to high literacy rates , state subsidization of intellectuals on a scale unknown in the West , and what , paraphrasing Nabakov , we might call capitalist propaganda , disseminated through Radio Liberty , the Voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The officially imposed fetters on the productivity of labor had a predictably disastrous impact on the All-Union economy . Ironically , what happened in the first workers ' state was exactly what Marx expected would happen when dominant relations of production persistently retard the development of the productive forces . In the rich North Atlantic , by contrast , the story has been very different . There , the rhetorical apotheosis of the private sphere has proceeded in lockstep with increased surveillance , manipulation , and control by institutions both public and private in that very same sphere . In the democracies of this region , we have witnessed an expansion of regulation in almost all aspects of life , while at the same time odes to the inviolable private sphere have become louder and found an ever larger audience . This strikes me as remarkable , and in need of a sort of explanation that the narrowly technological approach can not provide . In considering how it is that those two trends have taken place , surely we ought // to consider whether , and if so in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one hand and the efficiency of political authority on the other hand are related by more than just the common preconditions provided by development of the instruments of production , narrowly conceived along technocratic lines . This is the problem to be broached in the balance of this chapter . It will be helpful to begin by examining at closer quarters representations of the triumph of the inviolable private sphere . DEPICTING THE APOLITICAL PRIVATE SPHERE In an oft-cited article , Francis Fukayama suggested that we " might " have reached the end of history : Western liberal democracy , lately universalized on the stage of world history , is to be " the final form of human government , " while in the domain of the economy ( which evidently has to do with little more than the selection and consumption of commodities that inexplicably pop up on display shelves and showroom floors ) , " easy access to VCRs and stereos " is the actualized ideal of the universal homogeneous state . For Fukayama , then , economic liberalism amounts essentially to the satisfaction of ever more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably in the sense that buying and selling , investment , hiring , and resource allocation decisions are largely in private hands . ' Accordingly , when control and ownership of the means of production are wrested from the state and returned to private hands , the absolutely free will has taken a stride forward in its career of self-actualization . Similar paeans to the private sphere have been voiced by contemporary figures who might be thought to have little in common with Fukayama . Rorty , for example , approvingly quotes Milan Kundera 's announcement that what is most precious about European culture is " ... its respect for the individual , for his original thought , and for his right to an inviolable private life . " ' The hallmark of Kundera 's " Euro pean spirit of freedom , " we are told , is the sanctity of- a sphere of con science , a private sphere protected against incursions by the state . // These paeans have not been limited to the usual anti-Communist millenarians of the New World Order , either . In his address to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Martin Jacques , editor of Marxism Today , suggested that in both the East and the West , " We live in a society which is increasingly driven by civil society rather than the state . " ' As evidence for this development he invites us to " Think of the enormous membership of environmental groups , or the range of cultural activity , or the massively enhanced role of the media . " This postwar development has been a source of crisis for the left , says Jacques , because leftists have always seen the state as the centerpiece of political change . However , if the state at one time used to represent politics in a concentrated form , it should no longer be seen like that : Power has shifted from the state to civil society . According to this picture , then , it would seem that civil society , whatever else it may be , is a pluralistic domain of political power that , at least for the most part , lies somewhere safely beyond the reach of the state . In order to execute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , even Mill , as we have seen , conceded that government must periodically make limited forays into the private sphere . For the sake of preserving freedom , however , these forays must be checked by a vigilant public , a free press , free universities , an independent judiciary , and other agencies independent of the government . A recent emigre writer restated the conventional paradigm well when he claimed that the distinction between the public and private spheres is determined by " the actual intrusion of the state or other organizations into the activity of groups and individuals . " ' In the case of " authoritarian societies like the Soviet Union in which the state controls all major spheres of social life , " the distinction between the public and private spheres lies in " the degree of individual autonomy from government interference . " Thus , in both the authoritarian East and the liberal democracies of the West , activities that belong to the private sphere ? which include a person 's choice of occupation and place of work , marriage partner , religious convictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that the former enjoy a larger degree of independence fr()In interenntion by the state and " other organizations . " It is evident , then , that the t onventional paradigm admits degrees of // privateness : The circle of family and friends , for example , is held to be more private by virtue of being less intruded upon by other institutions , governmental or otherwise , than the sphere of such voluntary associations as , say , chambers of commerce , unions , and sports clubs . The distinction between public and private , then , is not absolute : The picture of a continuum is more appropriate in the application of this paradigm to social analysis . According to this paradigm , With an aggressive state like Stalin 's or Mao 's , private life in a society can be reduced to almost zero , with family and other small groups almost completely exposed to the regular intervention of state agencies , usually the political police . ' In the liberal democracies of the West , by contrast , there is supposedly less intervention by state agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary associations . In the vocabulary of this paradigm , when the government or the state supposedly divests itself of whole domains that it had previously controlled or supervised directly , it is said that privatization has taken place . The degree of privatization that has taken place is " a leading indicator of dynamics in democratic and nondemocratic societies . " ' ? In view of how widespread this paradigm is , it is not surprising that the decisions of central authorities to privatize the Russian and Chinese economies have been hailed by some as the dawn of a new era of democracy , while the same sources have denounced popular victories in Guatemala , Chile , and Nicaragua as totalitarian when they have involved the nationalization of foreign-owned corporate holdings . " As already noted , and as should become even clearer below , Rorty subscribes to this picture of the relationship between the private sphere and governmental institutions in the liberal democracies . I will argue , by contrast , that private individuals , as well as " primary " and " secondary " groups , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented extent by dominant political forces that project power far beyond the institutions of the state proper . The notion of privacy as a distinct right originated in English and // colonial American opposition to arbitrary police intrusion and search and seizure . Louis Brandeis notwithstanding , no such right is mentioned in the U.S. Constitution . Nevertheless , according to a common assumption which contrasts sharply to the view I defend , the legal right to privacy , like the right to property , is a natural relation that has finally come to be respected and protected by the liberal democratic state . In this regard , we may refer to an exemplary " expert opinion " which appears in an anthology published by a prestigious university press : One basic finding of animal studies is that virtually all animals seek periods of individual seclusion or small-group intimacy . This is usually described as the tendency toward territoriality , in which an organism lays private claim to an area of land , water or air and defends it against intrusion by members of its own species . " The author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the long-suffering laboratory rat . Then the cultural anthropologists are trotted out on cue to testify to the universal need for privacy among the Tikopia , the Tlingit , and the Tuareg . Thus , in the figure of the savage we discover once again the requisite link between nature and civilization . The author of this passage has given academic imprimatur to a pervasive prejudice that Karl Marx excoriated a century and a half ago . Referring to the political revolution that resulted in the foundation of the secular democratic republics of his day , the twenty-five-year-old Marx wrote : Its attitude to civil society , to the world of need , to work , to private interests , private law is that they are the foundation of its existence , its own presupposition that needs no further proof , and thus its natural basis . " 1s recent interpreters of " animal studies " confirm , it is still a widely held belief today that natural man is the precondition for civil society , which in turn is the basis of the bourgeois state . Today , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusion that bourgeois social relations and // the relations of domination that they inscribe are as immutable as the natural order . One need do little more than state these assumptions explicitly in order to cast doubt on them . It is tempting to suspect , for example , that the whole history of our species has been retrospectively reconstructed to conform to a historically contingent contemporary prejudice . One would expect Rorty , the historical nominalist , to support Marx 's view . After writing ? perhaps with some degree of naivete ? that " There is not , in fact , much naivete left these days , " he adds : " Tell a sophomore at an American college that something is only a social construct , and she is likely to reply Yeah , I know . So are you , Mac . ' ' 14 Since Rorty views humanity as a product of luck and chance , presumably he views the public/private split , as it is institutionalized in the liberal West today , the same way . When he is explicit about the contingency of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he has called the " historicist , including Marxist , critics of liberal individualism. " ' 15 At crucial junctures , however , he occasionally writes as though he has slipped back into the view Marx criticized . This is apparent , for example , when , as we saw in the previous chapter , he reinstates the egoistic private person alongside the altruistic decent citizen as perennial and ineradicable members of any remotely attractive polity ( any polity , that is to say , that is conducive to Rawls 's two principles of justice ) . ' It is also apparent , though perhaps less obviously so , in his approval of what Berlin and Kundera have referred to as the inviolable private sphere . Whether or not we reject the assumption that the private sphere was ordained by nature , however , we are still confronted with the impression that , in the modern period at least , it certainly appears to be ineradicable . After all , it has reasserted itself time and again , with almost irresistible tenacity , both in contemporary reality and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West , from Hobbes and Locke to Constant , Tocqueville , the Mills , and Dewey . One reason Hegel has attracted renewed attention from liberal thinkers such as Fukayama might be that , while he acknowledged the historical specificity of the private sphere , he also emphasized the inevitability of its appearance . I legel also provides insights into the relationship between the notions of the private sphere and civil society , FREEDOM AND LIBERALISM IN PRACTICE and between the latter and political institutions . In his Philosophy of Right , the author contrasted " the family , " as the embodiment of abstract particularity , to burgerlich Gesellschat , conceived as a " system of needs . " Within civil society , that welter of particular wills , some persons recognize that their particular interests are consonant with the interests of others . On the basis of this recognition of common interests , an association is formed that resembles Dewey 's Great Community . What Hegel calls the political state , as an " objective organization " distinct from civil society , presents itself to the immediate observer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are subsidized through " public funds , " chiefly in the form of tax revenue . In contemporary terms , a system of such institutions is composed of a wide variety of institutions , including : the head of state ; the legislature ; the administration ( which now extends far beyond the traditional bureaucracy of the state to take in a large variety of ministries , committees and other bodies such as central banks , policy planning groups and regulatory commissions ) ; the judiciary ; subcentral , regional , prefectural and municipal governments ; the military , police , courts , and penal systems ; and such ancillary setups as postal services , social services and welfare bureaucracies , public school systems , and so on . The public sphere is sometimes thought of as encompassing the state , conceived as the sum total of these institutions in their specific global organization and interaction , plus all other social institutions not included in the private sphere . Returning to Dewey 's advice encountered in chapter 1 , it might not be worth the trouble to attempt to draw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining particular historical circumstances . In any case , we need not attempt to do so for present purposes . ( For present purposes , we also need not examine the otherwise momentous transmogrification of state institutions , as both a consequence and a contributing causal factor in a number of interrelated processes we may abbreviate here with the word globalism . ) Now that we have at least the rough contours of the " political state " in view , we are in a position to compare the preceding sketch of the private sphere as a refuge from political authority to an alternative description of the relationship bemeen the system of state institutions we have identified and the pm ate sphere Iv aim in the next section is to // present , in as brief a space as possible , some key terms of an alternative vocabulary for conceptualizing this relationship . STATE POWER AND THE PRIVATE SPHERE Let us begin with an underacknowledged but empirically verifiable observation : In the countries of the rich North Atlantic , among other places , a large part of the social surplus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who themselves are not producers . In a Marxist sense of the term , then , these communities are class-divided . " This would not appear to be a terribly difficult position to defend , particularly in view of the enormous and increasing gap between rich and poor , both globally and within the richest countries themselves . The UN Human Rights Development Committee released a report in early June 1997 that concluded that , despite fifty years of phenomenal economic growth , the gap between haves and have-nots has also grown . Not only is one-quarter of the earth 's human population living in " severe poverty , " but , according to the report , the gap between rich and poor in the most highly industrialized countries is wider than it has been since the 1930s . In the last quarter of the twentieth century , the North Atlantic countries have witnessed burgeoning gross domestic products , record-high corporate profits , skyrocketing stocks and bonds markets , gigantic mergers , and eight-digit salaries for top CEOs . They have also witnessed feverish " downsizing , " massive capital flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slipping wages , and slumping living standards for the working population . Even the " press of record " in the United States has acknowledged the latter trends , however infrequently and grudgingly . According to a series on downsizing that appeared in the New York Times in March 1966 , for example , the percentage change in real income for four-fifths of the U.S. population from 1990 to 1994 was between -1 and -5 percent , while the top 5 percent registered a 15 percent rise . Annual median family income , adjusted for inflation in 1994 dollars , decreased from 1990 to 1993 , and only slightly rebounded in 1994 to approxiFREEDOM // mately the 1992 level . Assuming a positive correlation of consumption and income levels , and assuming furthermore that consumption levels play an important role in the determination of living standards , these figures confirm that living standards for a large part of the United States are indeed slipping , and that the enormous gap between rich and poor in America is growing.18 Clearly , these trends are instances and effects of well-organized and invigorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from disorganized and demoralized workers . In view of these trends , the fact that Rorty has only rarely acknowl-edged the class-divided character of existing liberal democracies should count as something of a virtuoso feat of insouciance . For him , it seems , wage earners must explicitly identify themselves as a class in order to count as a class at all . This interpretation is consistent with the l ) eweyan view mentioned in chapter 2 . According to this view , we should recall , a group of wage earners who lack a commonly accepted ends-in-view embodied in distinct institutions could constitute at best only a potential or inchoate public . Viewed in this light , the only prop-erly identifiable class that exists in the rich North Atlantic is " the busi-ness community , " or the monopoly capitalist class , with its multitude of active trade agreements , regulatory commissions , business associations , lobbies , cartels , government connections , research and policy-planning institutes , interlocking directorates , and so on . Regardless of how class-conscious , well-organized , and compact capitalists are ? or , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social divisions , there can be no struggle between classes as long as wage earners remain disorganized , fragmented , and confused . So , for example , when Rorty discusses liberalism as " the attempt to fulfill the hopes of the North Atlantic bourgeoisie , " 19 there is no suggestion that these attempts are tied up with the exploitation of workers , class conflict at home , or imperialism internationally . By Rorty 's lights , the qualifier bourgeois in the term bourgeois liberalism designates little more than unspecified " his-torical , and especially economic , conditions . " This helps to explain how , despite formidable evidence of class divisions and antagonisms in the rich North Atlantic , ' " Rorty has sug-gested that talk of class divisions is " clumsy " or otherwise not worth the // trouble ! ' Indeed , if one is committed at the outset to defending the proposition that in liberal communities there is a " harmonization of diverse impulses into common purposes , " then talk of exploitation , class conflict , and state power may well be worse than clumsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , he typically speaks of it as a thing of the past . At one point , for example , he likens what he takes to be " nostalgia " for the class struggle to nostalgia for les roil faineants , idle kings . " Once we problematize Rorty 's assumption of harmony among diverse impulses , however , a dark shadow begins to fall over his liberal vision . For one thing , assuming that most workers have not chosen to be exploited , his Deweyan picture of a liberal community composed of a multitude of voluntary associations united by common ends-in-view begins to appear either far-fetched or trivial , depending on what one wishes to mean by the adjective voluntary . In his justly influential essay , " Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses , " " Louis Althusser has noted that the institutions that make up the state operate , in large part , by violence or the threat of violence , however attenuated or symbolic the threat may be . Althusser has advanced the following description of the state from a perspective of its coercive function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which enables the ruling classes . . . to ensure their domination over the working class , thus enabling the former to subject the latter to the process of surplusvalue extortion ( i.e. , to capitalist exploitation ) . " This emphasis on the coercive character of the state has a long pedigree in anarchist literature , as well as such Marxist classics as the Communist Manifesto , the Eighteenth Brumaire , and Class Struggles in France , and Lenin : r State and Revolution . Even " mainstream " political theorists come close to certifying the state as a constellation of repressive apparatuses when they represent it as monopolizing legitimate violence . Althusser 's formulation , as general as it is , would of course have to be reformulated in an even more general way to cover most noncapitalist states . A broader formulation from the same functional perspective // might be stated as follows : A state enables at least one class , the appropriating class or classes , to subject other classes to one or more forms of appropriation , which tend to increase the appropriating class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value relative to other social groups . This process of subjection takes the form of coercion , both with respect to internal discipline , cen-sorship , and so on within a given institution , as well as coercion projected outward , beyond the institution itself . The institutions of the " political state " mentioned above play a role in maintaining or extending class domination by enabling one or more classes to subject other classes to extortion of the social surplus . When particular classes are able , thanks in large part to the state , to appro-priate a relatively large share of the social surplus , those classes may be described as ruling classes . By virtue of its relationship to the state as a whole , ' - ' a ruling class may be said , metaphorically , to " wield " state power . Accordingly , state power may be thought of as a special case of polit-ical power : It is the power of one or more classes exercised over other social groups through the state as a whole . James Madison alluded to this political function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the proper aim of government is to protect " the minority of the opulent " against the majority . Of course , the individual agents whose actions directly secure the dominance of a given class typically have remained unaware of their role , and are not even for the most part members of a ruling class . This is confirmed by the drama that workers play out hour by hour , day by day , in the capitalist West , and it was especially poignant in the case of Polish workers , who enthusiastically sacrificed much in the early years of Lech Walesa 's tenure to bring to power a capitalist regime that has rewarded them with lower wages , job insecurity , and the dismantling of social programs taken for granted in the past . When state institutions on the whole have ensured social relations conducive to more than one mode of appropriating the surplus , we may speak of a ruling class alliance . Slaveholding planters and northern indus-trial capitalists , for example , firmed a precarious ruling class alliance in the antebellum United States . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given class alliance . In the years leading up to the ( : ivil 11ar , fir example , church leaders , publishers , and // other professional intellectuals in the North allied themselves ever more closely with the northern industrialists . These considerations complicate the picture , but they do not change the fact that there are ruling classes and subaltern classes.z " State institutions often survive transferal of state power to incipient class forces . This observation , needless to say , does not apply solely to the postal system and elevator inspectors . One may readily discern this point by considering the continuity of a large part of the bureaucratic and military machinery of the former Soviet state in the wake of Yeltsin 's fall 1991 countercoup and the final , full disenfranchisement of Russian workers under Yeltsin 's tenure . Nevertheless , in order to extend their own organization and to hamstring incumbent ruling alliances , newly ascendant class forces have frequently been pushed to restructure , dismantle , gut , and destroy old state institutions and create new ones in their own image " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forego historical illustrations : When a new class alliance achieves state power , it does not as a rule simply take over the helm of a preexisting state that remains the neutral terrain of class struggle . It is also important to note here that individual state institutions are themselves sites of class struggle , however unequal that struggle may be . It might suffice as an illustration of this point to consider that in the final hours of waning class rule , even the ranks of the praetorian guards may split , part of them going over to the side of the insurgency . Moreover , in less tumultuous times , representatives of subaltern classes may capture positions in municipal , regional , and national legislatures , governments , and ministries . Indeed , we have witnessed instances ? most recently in Japan , Brazil , Italy , India , and National Assembly elections in France ? in which representatives of normally militant working class organizations have occupied the highest legislative and executive offices in nonrevolutionary periods of governmental or parliamentary crisis . The fact that a ruling class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , does not imply that its political power is any less effective or emphatic . For one thing , as we have already emphasized , state power , though exercised in large part through state institutions , is not confined to those institutions . One might cone - // pare here the discipline enforced within the ranks of a police department to the violence the police force projects beyond its own ranks . Key institutions of the modern state have projected state power ever further , over an ever wider array of nonstate institutions , including " private enterprise , " the church , and the family . It is important to recognize , moreover , that extending the power of a ruling class is not exclusively the function of state institutions . Many nonstate institutions , both public and private , also mediate conflicts among ruling class elements and enhance their coordination , compactness , and agility , while thwarting , hamstringing , and fragmenting subaltern classes and strata . Obvious examples in the latter category may include such " private " economic associations as chambers of commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I have already indicated , and as should be clear in any case , violence and repression are not the only forms that political domination takes . As Gramsci has emphasized , even the most repressive ruling class would not be able to maintain the social order for long if it were to rely solely on violence and the threat of violence . Without securing at least some degree of consent from subaltern groups , class rule can not be maintained . To gain a more panoramic view of political power and class rule , we need to cast a glance , however briefly , at some of the noncoercive institutions and practices that have assumed great importance in the contemporary West . Gramsci proposed an alternative conception of the state , which is usually thought of as political society ? i.e. , a dictatorship or some other coercive apparatus used to control the masses in conformity with a given type of production and economy ? and not as a balance between political society and civil society , by which I mean the hegemony of one social group over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church , trade unions , or schools.z " Elaborating on this train of thought , Althusser has provided a vivid picture of the role of a wide variety of institutions in the reproduction of the social order . I Ic has noted that such institutions as spectator sports , // churches , and even the family ? forms of association which in the secular North Atlantic are represented as paradigmatically distinct from the state have in fact played a crucial role in the reproduction of the skills of labor power and labor power 's subjection to the established order.29 With reference to the complex and variegated contemporary states of the North Atlantic , then , it does not appear to be possible to distinguish between state and nonstate institutions solely on the basis of the function of ensuring the reproduction of prevailing relations of production . Aside from the many seamless connections between the state and " private enterprise , " another reason for this difficulty is that , as noted , individual state institutions are themselves strategic positions in the class struggle , positions that have been contested and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class character of the state as a whole has not faced a serious challenge . The observation that there is no hard-and-fast line of demarcation between the modern state and nonstate institutions is instructive when it comes to evaluating the conventional paradigm of the relationship between the private sphere and the state . As Gramsci has noted and Althusser has repeated , ' ? the state itself is the precondition of any distinction between the public and the private . The distinction between the public and private spheres is , among other things , a distinction between categories of bourgeois law within what Marx metaphorically referred to as the superstructure . It is a distinction , moreover , which is an effect of political power ? which in turn is always , at least to some extent , contested . In this regard , one might consider the early clashes of the bourgeoisie with the ancien regime around demands for the separation of church and state , protection of personal property rights , habeas corpus , and probable cause . Or one might consider later struggles over public education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , and civil rights legislation . We should keep in mind that the distinction between categories of bourgeois law does not have an immaterial , ideal existence . On the contrary , beyond the material embodiments of this legal distinction ? in legislation and case law , in public school curricula , architecture , and urban design , in the institutional practices and normalization techniques that Foucault describes in Discipline and Punisli , in the actual disFREEDOM // courses of biologically and socially formed subjects ? there is nothing else to point to , outside the realm of theology and idealist metaphysics , as an instantiation of the public/private split . The diremption of public and private spheres accompanied ( but of course does not neatly correspond to ) the progressive separation of the state from the economy in the transition from feudalism to capitalism in parts of Europe . " Peasants were forced into the cities as land was capitalized ; political power was centralized as it shifted from the countryside to the city ; labor markets developed ; the guilds were transformed ; constitutional rights and obligations replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessors ; and simultaneously the private sphere evolved as a legal category . In the rich North Atlantic , at least , the public/private distinction is not a horizontal partition of a community into a lower private rcalm and a higher public realm ; rather , it is present at the " individual " and " primary group " levels , just as much as at the level of the judiciary and the legislature . ' ' Indeed , as Althusser and others have argued , the public/private split is a component of individuality itself : One and the same individual human being is both legal subject , accountable to the law , and private subject , accountable to her creator , her conscience , and the market . Unions , chambers of commerce , sports clubs , fraternal associations , schools , churches , and political parties ? each of these voluntary associations exists by virtue of constituting or reproducing individual humans as subjects , that is , by constituting or reproducing a given mode of subjectivity or selfhood ? either as mother or father , union member , alumnus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of religious believers , of performers of certain rituals , after all , there is no religion . This observation , as far as it goes , resembles the claim , which we have already attributed to Dewey , that individuals both form and are formed by social groups . When we turn to involuntary associations , however , differences between the two views become significant . According to the view presented , political institutions and practices of class rule , including involuntary associations , plav a crucial role in reproducing individuals as legal subjects , wage earners , felons , and so on . " State institutions , in particular , prescribe not omly the character of public selfhood , but also to a // large extent the character of private , nonvoluntary associations , and hence the character of private selfhood . By enforcing the separation of church and state , for example , judiciaries , legislatures , tax authorities , and so on have been instrumental in making religion " purely a matter of conscience . " And this has had a profound impact on the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn has bolstered the Jeffersonian compromise and enhanced the stability of bourgeois social relations . In chapter 2 , we noted that Rorty has abandoned Dewey 's hope that members of a democratic community could be reconstructed to efface the contrast between private selfhood and community-spirited public selfhood . In view of the preceding observations , it is easy to agree with the critic who wrote that , " Rorty 's assumption that there is a private self which can be formulated independently of the public one neglects the social origins and implications of the self . " , ' This is as true of the strong poet as of the decent citizen . In post ? cold war eastern Europe , as in the rich North Atlantic , political power has been reinvested in private associations and nonstate public associations ( notably mafias and , to a far less extent , the muchballyhooed nongovernmental organizations ) , all the while augmenting the power of the new ruling classes . As I have emphasized in this section , however , one important reason for this is the role that nonstate institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " churches , schools , reformist unions , and the bourgeois family , at least in some of its permutations . Even domestic drug-trafficking gangs could count as highly " functional " associations in the latter category , considering their demoralizing and demobilizing effect on working-class neighborhoods . On the other hand , it should be stressed that discourses and activities that subvert prevailing relations of domination are not all the result of dysfunctional public institutions . To take some obvious examples , the most consistently militant workers ' parties , unions , national liberation movements , and Christian base communities have not been public institutions that just did not do what they were " supposed " to do . These institutions have been characterized by internal organizational structures and practices geared for battle against the state and ruling class alliances . These structures and practices may have included clandestineness , democratic or bureaucratic centralism , abstention frenn elecFREEDOM // total politics or the use of elections for merely " pedagogical " purposes , and a preparedness to resort to such militant tactics as general strikes , land seizure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into conflict with coercive institutions of the state when they have done what they were " supposed " to do . It would seem that the demands of a subaltern group can not be launched from a platform beyond the sanction of the state without at least posing a threat to the dominant position of the ruling class force . As long as Jim Crow remained on the books , police and FBI officials viewed even the avowedly nonviolent civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s as a threat to " national security . " By contrast , when legal and extralegal impediments to the activism of subaltern groups are removed and the political struggle is transferred to terrain within the compass of state surveillance and control , the political struggle , however heated , takes place on a playing field which as a rule is steeply inclined in favor of the ruling class alliance . These observations are all the more poignant when it comes to accounting for the resilience of capitalist class rule in the West . In " the most advanced states , " Gramsci noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure , and one which is resistant to the catastrophic incursions ' of the immediate economic element ( crises , depressions , etc. ) . " i6 The modern state and what Gramsci referred to as civil society break up opposition the way a prism breaks up white light . Both state and nonstate institutions channel dissent into myriad legal institutions , and in this way they absorb the shock of opposition into themselves . Gramsci described this process well : The massive structures of the modern democracies , both as state organizations , and as complexes of associations in civil society , constitute for the art of politics as it were the " trenches " and the permanent fortifications of the front in the war of position : they render P , merely " partial " the element of movement which before used to be the whole " of war , etc . " In the Fast , by contrast ( and c%idently Gramsci had Russia foremost in mind ) , " the general econotnit cultural social conditions ( andl the // structure of national life are embryonic and loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " ' It would seem , then , that within the context of the contemporary north Atlantic , both the public and the private spheres must be brought , at least in large part , under the sway of dominant political institutions , state or nonstate , or the continuity of prevailing relations of production and class rule will be at risk . If , for instance , a ruling class attempts to maintain its political domination by proscribing the contest for control of representative institutions from the arena of legal political activity , this struggle may then take the form of a military siege by an enemy which is then , by definition , opposed to the state . According to the account presented so far , we will notice , both the private and the public are political constructs . The private sphere is itself , at least in large part , an effect of politics , conceived broadly not as tinkering aimed at consensus and amelioration of suffering , but as a struggle among classes , the highest stakes of which are state power . Proceeding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the strong poet recognizes a duty as itself largely an effect of state institutions and other public institutions . Thus , one may conclude , pace Rorty , that autonomy , or lack thereof , is to a large extent an effect of social institutions . It should be noted , moreover , that one may accept this conclusion without thereby subscribing to the view against which Rorty convincingly polemicizes , to the effect that autonomy is " something which all human beings have within them and which society can release by ceasing to repress them . " " So far , I have sketched a picture of the state as inseparable from the reality of class domination , of state power as a stake of political struggle , of state institutions as sites of class struggle , and of political power as an effect of nonstate institutions as well as state institutions . This sketch contrasts sharply to Dewey 's picture of the state as " the organization of the public effected through officials for the protection of the interests shared by its members , " to Rorty 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and to Dewey 's assumption , which Rorty shares , that " politics is a matter of everyone pulling together to solve common problems . " ' , We are now in a better position to compare Rorty 's account of ' the apolitical private sphere , presented in chapter Z , with the account of ' the // state and the private sphere sketched in this section . A convenient way of doing this would be to evaluate the very different ways in which the two accounts allow us to compare the defunct nominally socialist states of eastern Europe with the liberal democracies of the North Atlantic . PRIVATIZATION AND SOCIALISM I will begin by making hay of headlines in an admittedly distasteful manner : As late as 1987 , Rorty wrote that " ... time seems to be on the Soviet side , " 4 ' and in a paper published two years later , he wrote , with reference to the " spectacularly successful Communist oligarchs " in the Soviet Union : Orwell was not the first person to suggest that small gangs of criminals might get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stay in control forever.92 A mere two years after Rorty disparaged the " unchanging second World run by an impregnable and ruthless Inner Party , " this " world , " its " intractable , " " monstrous " regimes , and its " ruthless " leaders , collapsed like a circus tent , scattering less debris in Moscow than settled on the streets of Los Angeles the following spring.a ' Since then , the victorious " reformers " and " democrats " apotheosized by cold war liberals have presided over the impoverishment and disenfranchisement of their populations , the worst political repression in Europe in half a century , and blood baths on a dozen killing fields from Kosovo to Tapkistan . Surely it is bad taste to toss an author 's political forecasts in his face from the unfair vantage point of eight-year retrospection . After all , Rorty could easily rally a legion of equally embarrassing prognostications from the same period authored by erstwhile admirers of " existing socialism . " Moreover , he provides us with evidence that he was not entirely oblivious to the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f ' ( rr the I OO I republication of a text first published in 1989 , he acknowledged that %%hat two years earlier he had referred to as " the ? unbreakable grip of the M . li in the Russian people and of the // Soviet army on a third of Europe " has been broken , thanks in large part to Mikhail Gorbachev , " the Abraham Lincoln of Eastern Europe . " " Sometimes , however , bad taste is warranted . There are two reasons why I permit myself to use Rorty 's political prognostications of a nearly a decade ago to motivate the discussion in this section . First of all , he engages in this sort of maneuver himself , and turnabout is fair play . Not only has he gainsaid socialist triumphalists retrospectively , in the light of developments at the beginning of Gorbachev 's tenure , but he also has condemned writers who , twenty years earlier and more , clung to the hope that the Soviet Union could have been reformed 35 Secondly , and more significantly for the present discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West : Whether lamenting the prospect or exalting in it , both sides confidently subscribed to an image of " existing socialism " that was at least in one respect a projection of the image of the liberal political systems within which they lived . According to this image , the Soviet regime was stable , in control , and in possession of lots of resources to stay in control . Nontriumphalists to the left of Rorty could also be indicted for the same offense , including the Frankfurters and Foucault , who , by casting both East and West into the same " technological , " " postindustrial , " or " carceral " pot , greatly overstated the flexibility and resources of the regimes in the East , and in this respect greatly underestimated the differences between East and West . The question we will raise for Rorty , then , must also be directed to many of his critics on the left : How could a person who " has read lots of books " have been so far off the mark as late as 1989 when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Eastern Bloc ? A possible response might be that these cosmopolitan academics have tended to underestimate the central role that virulent nationalism played in their " velvet revolutions . " Faithful heirs of the Enlightenment , including Gorbachev himself , preferred to think of their allies against the old guard as fellow democrats with " normal civilized " goals , rather than as the opportunists , obstreperous megalonianiacs , and ethnic cleansers they so often turned out to be . // Another possible response to this question , one that is more relevant to the present discussion , might entail defending the following claim : Whether or not the Soviet leadership was a gang of criminals in some special but unspecified sense in which the leadership of , say , the United States is not , 46 the Soviet Union most certainly did not exemplify a " modern state , " at least with reference to institutions that generate the consent of the governed . This last point is particularly evident with reference to private forms of association under " actually existing socialism . " Past claims of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear that in Eastern Europe private life had been made public . On the contrary , as a previously cited source has noted , Since the late 1950s the Soviet people have gradually but unswervingly diverted their interests from the state to their primary groups ( family , friends , and lovers ) and to semi-legal and illegal civil society as well as to illegal activity inside the public sector . " As is well-known , this process of privatization had been taking place for a long time , at the individual , family , and friendship levels , at the level of the so-called mass organizations , and even at the level of the highest apparatchiks . Ample evidence of this trend could have been collected by almost anyone with even casual contact with the woefully inefficient state-owned industrial enterprises , or the cooperative and state farms , or the venal state functionaries and party officials who regularly took advantage of their positions for personal gain . Because of their corruption and inefficiency , the old regimes of Vastern Europe were forced to augment their more directly repressive state institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention to quell popular uprisings , as in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 . Predictably enough , these and other repressive measures had the opposite effect . As Nicos Poulantzas wrote at least thirteen years before 1991 : Not only does authoritarian statism fail to enclose the masses in its disciplinary web or to " integrate " them in its authoritarian circuits ; it // actually provokes general insistence on the need for direct , rank-andfile democracy ? a veritable explosion of democratic demands . " These regimes did not just provoke democratic demands , however ; they also created the space both within state institutions and outside them for the formation of subversive associations . What rendered state institutions in Eastern Europe highly dysfunctional was not just inefficiency within their domains of authority , but also the limited scope of their operation . In some cases , such as widespread black marketeering within state-owned enterprises , state power did not even saturate important state institutions , let alone private associations . Rather than being controlled and regulated to a great extent by state institutions , as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large part by fissiparous and increasingly assertive institutions lacking state sanction . These included organized crime syndicates , the church , the samizdat , human-rights watch groups , and later , independent trade unions , nationalist fronts , and full-blown opposition parties . Even the most intimate primary groups were transformed at least partially into subversive institutions . Surveys conducted in the final years of the Soviet period indicate the prevalence of private institutions ? including that sanctum sanctorum of the private sphere , the family ? over public ones , including state institutions , in forming the value systems of the respondents ? Smaller families , a growing desire for economic independence on the part of the younger generation , and rejection of cohabitation with parents after marriage ? all of these developments , and many more besides , testify to increased " privatization within private life , " while at the same time they provide further impetus for extended privatization . ' Similar observations apply to other areas of the private sphere , as well as to other Eastern European states . In one case after another , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a fortress , and then a secure rear base for a frontal assault against the state . However accurate this model of the relationship between the state and nonstate associations may have been with reference to Eastern Europe , however , it does not fit well with reference to the advanced capitalist West . In the liberal democracies , even the most intimate realms of ' activity play an important role in maintaining dominant social relations // of production . For example , Althusser and others have emphasized the role of the nuclear family in reproducing prevailing relations of class domination . ' ' This view may well have been too unilateral with reference to the French bourgeois family under the Fifth Republic , let alone the transmogrified family structures of the contemporary United States , where , thanks in part to a 50 percent divorce rate , the patriarchal nuclear family consisting of a male breadwinner and a female housewife accounts for only 12 percent of the households . Also , the importance of ' the nuclear family in this context has diminished relative to public schools and television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family in the liberal democracies has , in large part , been spared exposure to direct and overt incursions by state agencies , it may simply be because the bourgeois family itself has not required much state intervention to function as a guarantor of the continuity of ruling class power . When , for any of a number of reasons , a particular family structure no longer reproduces dominant social relations efficiently ( as , fir example , in the case of France in the closing years of the nineteenth century , or the United States in the final years of the twentieth century ) , it has been subject to the increased intervention of state institutions . " Poulantzas has argued that the state 's ability to reproduce itself " depends on the institutional integration of power relationships . Ironically , in the case of the highly centralized states of the East these power relationships were far less integrated than in the liberal democratic states of the advanced capitalist West . In view of the diminishing power of subversive institutions in the advanced capitalist West , Poulantzas 's observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made : There is no limit de jure or in principle to the modern State 's encroachment on the private . However paradoxical it may seem , the very separation of public and private that is established by the State opens up for it bound-less vistas of power . " If ' in Eastern Europe the private sphere was continually violated by a handful of ' enormous acrd rnormousIN , unwieldy , corrupt , and incompetent bureaucracies , in the 1rt it is supervised not by one or two centralized bureaucracies , but by multiple networks of overlapping institu110 RICHARD RORTY 'S POLITICS tions , both state and nonstate , public and private , which are not limited to such narrowly repressive state agencies as the FBI , the Immigration and Naturalization Service , and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms . Consider , for example , such private sources of information as employment records , telephone accounts , academic transcripts , credit reports , actuarial projections , medical records , psychodiagnostic assessments , background checks by insurance agencies and private investigators , and omnipresent electronic monitors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white-collar work sites , and cyberspace . In his book The Naked Consumer , Eric Larson describes the formidable private sector information networks that monitor , track , and manipulate consumers . The profusion of examples testifies to the pervasiveness of nonstate surveillance , regulation , and manipulation of private life in the rich North Atlantic . To complicate matters , it is not always a straightforward task to distinguish state from nonstate agencies of surveillance and control . This is true particularly in the West , where , as we have already noted : ( a ) the administration of the state extends far beyond the traditional bureaucracy , to encompass central banks , regulatory commissions , lobbies , nonprofit corporations and foundations , policy planning institutes , and other agencies , each of which has its own resources for information-gathering and control , and ( b ) the power of big business has merged seamlessly with the state . Furthermore , as we have indicated , the scope of state intervention and the compass of state power have been anything but fixed . One generalization to be drawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that multiple sites on terrain contested by state power have been flashpoints of class conflict . Working-class leaders and organizations have fought long and hard to expand state supervision in the areas of union recognition , minimum wage laws , corporate taxes , regulation of industry and commerce , social security , occupational safety , environmental safeguards , and social programs . At the same time , some of the same individuals and organizations have fought bitter battles for a rigorous implementation of the Bill of Rights , to restrict the operation of state agencies , especially repressive ones , in the private sphere . And iii each of these battles , they have encountered much resistance from ruling-class forces . The character and compass of ' state and nonstate // public institutions have been a bone of contention vis-a-vis both institutions of the " private sector " and the " primary groups " of the private sphere . The first category would include conflicts over regulation , antitrust legislation ( which in any case have amounted to little more than pro forma concessions to widespread discontent ) , S4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subsidies to industries , health care , social security , and so on . The second category would include contention over freedom of speech , reproductive rights , due process , sodomy laws , the separation of church and state , " family values , " and so on . In recent years the battle zone has expanded to cyberspace , as opponents have clashed over the Telecommunications Bill , the future of the so-called information superhighway , surveillance of the Internet , and control of the content of multimedia programming . These examples underscore the observation already made , to the effect that the border between state and nonstate institutions and between the public and private spheres are blurry , elastic , discontinuous , and shifting lines of scrimmage which are often , though not always , located on political terrain defined by state institutions . Moreover , at the risk of further complicating a picture that is already exceedingly complex , it is important to keep in mind the class character of the terrain itself and the fact that it also undergoes constant transformation . As the foregoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative rights embodied in documents such as the Bill of Rights as somehow carving a sphere of freedom away from the mechanisms of class rule and political domination . To paraphrase Foucault , we must not think that by saying yes to the private sphere we say no to political power . The contrast-term for private sphere is public sphere , not the state . Moreover , as I have indicated , state power far overreaches state institutions . It would seem , then , that Jacques 's picture of a power shift from the state to civil society is inaccurate , or at least stated in a misleading manner . ' Prue , many functions that , at least at the official level , used to be reserved for public institutions of the state have indeed shifted squarely to the nonstate institutions of what he calls civil society , and to more intimate realms . Isar front detracting from the power of the ascendant ruling class alliance , however , this shift has greatly enhanced that power . // Let us recall the instances Jacques cites to illustrate his claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of cultural activities , " and the massively enhanced role of the media today . As it turns out , each one of these instances could be turned convincingly againstJacques 's claim . One might note , for starters , the co-optation and political neutralization of events such as Earth Day by corporations and state commissions ; the futility of the Rio Summit ; or the political use of the rain forest issue by the IMF to inhibit the development of more independent capitalist economies in the South , to the benefit of the G-7 . With reference to cultural activities , one might consider the monotonous , soporific , and demoralizing effects of increasingly corporate-sponsored cultural activities in the rich North Atlantic , s5 or recall John Foster Dulles 's prescient observation that culture is the leading edge of U.S. foreign policy . Edward Said 's remark might also be relevant in this context : I would like to suggest that many of the most prominent characteristics of modernist culture , which we have tended to derive from purely internal dynamics in Western society and culture , include a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with reference to the enormous influence of the media today , Jacques would do well to consult Ben Bagdikian 's book , The Media Monopoly , for documentation of the rapid and massive concentration of ownership of the electronic and print media in fewer and fewer hands , and the ever closer connection between the corporate media and the government . These observations bring us back to the conclusion that in the advanced capitalist West , the private sphere conforms to and bolsters the liberal democratic state and capitalist class rule : Almost all domestic political opposition is loyal opposition ; the content of the omnipresent and increasingly corporate-owned press and entertainment industries meshes ever more finely with state policy ; and nearly all " cultural expression , " including supposedly subversive art , has been tolerated and even subsidized by the state . As Foucault and I'oulantzas have indicated each in his own way , surveillance in a " pluralist society " ? that is , a setup // in which there is a broad mix of functions of public and private institutions ? reins in nearly the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ominous prognostications about some twentieth-century states miss his intended target . If there are regimes that have stayed in power thanks in large part to modern technology , they were not the member-states of the Warsaw Pact , but rather the rich North Atlantic democracies , including Rorty 's own liberal democratic experiment , the United States of America . The private sphere is not a realm of freedom insulated from political power ? least of all in the liberal democracies of the West , where it is thought to be freest . Like American bison in a theme park , what Rorty has referred to as " Emerson 's American sense of a new kind of social freedom " 57 survives in a much-diminished form , as a simulacrum of a sentimentalized past , within a well-circumscribed and controlled domain . Thus , Orwell 's question , which Rorty approvingly repeats , 58 is aimed one hundred eighty degrees in the wrong direction : The question whether one can remain free inside should be directed in the first place to the rich North Atlantic , where the private sphere functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exploiters . Leninists have been accused of postulating the absence of civil society . Indeed , the apparent reassertion of civil society , and the intractability of the private sphere in Eastern Europe seem to be chief reasons why Jacques and other leftists have claimed that Leninism " has had its day . " It may well be true that what distinguishes the Leninist view of state power from other perspectives is the repudiation in theory of the notion of civil society , as well as skepticism as to whether it is at all meaningful to speak of a private sphere in the absence of the state.59 What has been said so far , however , would suggest that by at least one possible interpretation , Lenin was affirming a great truth when , speaking of the Bolsheviks , he once said " We do not recognize anything private . ' " ? To the extent that the private is a legal category instantiating the system of ownership of the means of production , and to the extent that the state stands above the law ( except , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularizers , and the many under their sway ) , Lenin 's rejection of the notion of a nonpolitical private sphere may well he an advantage for descriptive purposes other than apologetics fiir bourgeois liberalism. // This , however , does not imply that , despite appearances , everything is really public " deep down . " I have presented a case for concluding that nothing is naturally or intrinsically either public or private . Nevertheless , as I have emphasized , the private sphere is not a pure illusion produced by false consciousness , either . It is , rather , an important component or aspect of contemporary social relations , an element that public policy makers ignore at their own risk . The proposals advanced during the period of perestroika confirm the view that Soviet leaders were compelled to acknowledge that a pervasive and vigorous private sphere had long ago become an established fact in the Soviet Union . It is instructive to consider several of their more sweeping proposals , with reference to public institutions of the state : ? Dismantle the unwieldy central planning bureaucracy and attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production more closely to consumer prices ? hopefully , within the context of economic planning . ( As we know , however , Gorbachev 's economic initiatives terribly undermined the well being of direct producers , while at the same time depriving workers of the old mechanisms for redress of grievances . ) ; ? Decentralize production by eliminating state subsidies to inefficient enterprises and legalizing forms of " personal property " and cooperative enterprises which would effectively amount to private ownership of the means of production ( though it would not necessarily amount to large-scale exploitation , as long as cooperatives would be prohibited from hiring large numbers of direct producers ) ; ? Foster independent workers ' unions and legalize the right to strike ; ? Scrap the scores of prohibitions and security measures obstructing access to new technologies , information , foreign travel , and resource allocation ; ? Separate the Party structure from that of the state , and inaugurate a multiparty candidate-selection system ; ' ' // ? Distinguish sharply between the property , rules , norms , and organizational principles of voluntary political organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework of representative democracy ? preferably , as a foundation upon which to build some form of participatory democracy , workers ' and consumers ' councils , and mass organizations ; " ? Put in place more effective guarantees for the negative rights of liberal democracy , while deemphasizing such " positive rights " as workers ' self-management and the right to a job ; ? Strengthen and regularize mechanisms for oversight and accountability , to enforce strict legality both within state institutions and within the Party ; ? Inaugurate a looser All-Union federal arrangement ( perhaps along lines proposed in the democratically ratified March 17 , 1991 referendum ) , granting a greater degree of self-determination to nations within the multinational state , and permitting much greater latitude for economic , cultural , and political initiatives at the republic level . Admittedly , this list is selective : Various constituencies advanced other demands that were less compatible with the point argued here . However partial this list may be , however , I believe it is representative of one dominant trend within the Soviet Communist Party in the late 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Mikhail Gorbachev . ' It would be accurate to characterize the proposals on this list as part of a sweeping movement towards privatization . As I have attempted to indicate , however , it would be incorrect to conclude from this that they amount to moves to diminish the extent of state power . True , most of the proposals listed involve expanding the private sphere at the expense of the public sphere , and state institutions in particular ; nevertheless , none of them requires a retreat of state power from the private sphere . On the contrary , implementation of some of these proposals has arguably intensified and expanded the terrain of political domination // by giving state sanction to large areas of private life previously ignored on the official level , while simultaneously bringing these areas under the authority of the state . Consider , for the sake of illustration , the myriad enterprises which have constituted so-called shadow economies in Eastern Europe : As these enterprises are forced to function aboveboard , they will in time probably become subject to greater state regulation and taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved to be too little , too late for the Soviet Union , it does not follow that they are , in principle , incompatible with socialism . Indeed , as I have suggested , prospects of alternatives to this sort of privatization would appear to be poor in the foreseeable future : If workers are to retain state power after winning it through political struggle , they will have to transform private forms of association into mechanisms of workers ' power , instead of attempting to proscribe them by means of repression . ' ' In the next section I will bolster the case against Rorty 's account of the inviolable private sphere by elaborating on the proposition that social institutions and practices , including involuntary associations and state institutions , play a crucial role in defining not only the character of public selfhood , but also to a large extent the character of private selfhood . My aim is to dispute Rorty 's claim that it is not fruitful to take as a topic of conversation how one 's notions of community and how even private self-descriptions facilitate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of doing this I will argue for a conception of ideology which is immune from his criticisms of Ideologiekritik . PRIVATE SELFHOOD AND IDEOLOGY David Hall has noted that " The grounds for Rorty 's hope and Foucault 's hopelessness lie in the different attitudes of these two thinkers toward the relations of the public and private sphere . ' Hall is repeating a theme of , for instance , the last two-thirds of CIS , as well as the final section of Rorty 's paper entitled " Method , Social Science and Social Hope , " included in CP . I Lill continues : // Insisting upon distinguishing the public and private spheres risks begging what for both Rorty and Foucault is the essentially empirical question of whether there is an efficacious private life for individuals , in liberal democratic societies . " Rorty answers this essentially empirical question in the affirmative , of course . As one might guess by now , however , this answer follows almost trivially from his definition of a liberal society as one which guarantees Kundera 's right to an inviolable private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different view of the private sphere . I have suggested that the state is a condition of actuality of both the public and the private spheres , and that private institutions as well as public ones play crucial roles in bolstering relations of exploitation consonant with capitalist class rule . While I have pointed out good empirical reasons for rejecting Rorty 's picture of an apolitical private sphere , I also have indicated that the private sphere is not a pure illusion of false consciousness , either . So if Hall takes the modifier efficacious in the passage just cited to signify that the distinction between public and private life makes a big nonlinguistic difference , then his " empirical question " may be answered as follows : Yes , of course there is an efficacious private life for individuals in liberal democracies . After all , the sphere of private life and private property is instantiated in architecture and urban planning , individual behavior , patterns of consumption and production , and so on , as well as in thousands of constantly reenacted legal procedures , institutional routines and norms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the context of Hall 's passage , however , that he holds that private life is efficacious to the extent that it is somehow self-sealing , or is prior to politics or separable from institutions of the state . If this is a correct interpretation of his view , then , as I have indicated , there are good reasons not to answer his question in the affirmative . If we take efficacious in this sense , then apparently Hall has failed to distinguish between the public sphere on the one hand and institutions of political domination on the other hand as distinct analytical categories . This would account for his and Rorty 's assumption that wherever there is an efficacious private sphere there is also freedom and the possibility of autononiv , as they use these terms . // For Foucault and many Marxists , by contrast , extensive state recognition of a private sphere is not synonymous with the expansion of negative freedom and the opportunity to achieve autonomy . On the contrary , if private associations and practices play such an important role in securing near-total submission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efficaciousness of the private sphere enables Foucauldians and Marxists to say more nasty things about " actually existing liberalism , " not fewer . It allows them , for instance , to add a new chapter to their stories of class rule or disciplinary practices , a long chapter that could be entitled " How the Private Sphere Enhances Domination by the Bourgeoisie . " I do not propose to write that chapter here . Rather , I want to scrutinize some of Rorty 's objections to such an undertaking . In particular , I want to examine his disparagement , in CIS and subsequent works , of the very attempt to describe the private sphere and private selfhood in a political light . This requires turning our attention to his disparagement of the use of the word " ideology " and its cognates . Rorty would like to convince his readers that " the " notion of ideology is useless . " In the following pages , however , it should become clear that his objections miss the mark when it comes to at least one conception of ideology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the proffered conception may be worse than useless for Rorty 's apologetic purposes ( to which we will return in chapter 5 ) , it should become clear that others who are less prone to such apologetics may well find it useful not only for private purposes of " tracing the blind impresses our behavings bear , " " but also for redescribing personal behavings in a way that is conducive to quite different political purposes . Let us review Rorty 's objections to Ideologiekritik.b9 There are several related criticisms : Speaking in the most general terms , he associates disquisitions about ideology with representationalist accounts of knowledge . He characterizes Ideologiekritik as an attempt to strip away systematically distorted representations of a thing , to unmask the one true description of it , its underlying dynamics. : " Thus , if representationalism goes , so does Ideologiekritik . As noted in chapter 1 , Rorty has convincingly argued that repreFREEDOM // sentationalism should go . He congratulates Wittgenstein for diagnosing the urge to ask " ... questions as to the essence of language , of propositions , of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fixation that " the essence is hidden from us . " Rorty also ascribes to some Ideologiekritiker , namely Marxists , " a fuzzy distinction between ideology ' and a form of thought ( the Marxists ' own ) which escapes being ideology . " ' 72 With a little help , perhaps , from Kolakowski and Castoriadis , he interprets Marx , a man whose favorite motto was De omnibus dubitandum , to have held that , at long last having ascended to the heights of science , it is possible to cast all pre vious knowledge at once into doubt . By this account , Marx would appear to be one of those " committed to the construction of a pernia nent , neutral framework for inquiry , and thus for all of culture . " Further on , Rorty provides an important clue as to what he means I ? ' " ideology " when he writes that the question of whether or not the critique of ideology is central to philosophy , as Habermas and others would have it , " turns on whether one thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ideology ' ? make it mean more than bad idea ! ' Rorty , oI ' course , does not believe that one can make " ideology " mean anything more interesting than " bad idea . " Presumably , a bad idea is an idea that one is warranted in declaring to be false , evil , unjust , or clumsy , because it has proven over time and in a variety of cases to be useless or detrimental fi , r a particular purpose . To the extent that the false is the had in the way of belief , then , Rorty 's " deflated " notion of ideology is truth-functional . Ideologiekritiker claim superscience status when they aspire to adju dicate beliefs in all vocabularies for all time and when they deny they are using a particular historically conditioned and temporary vocahu lary . They have claimed to fulfill the latter role in at least one of at least two ways : ( 1 ) by permitting us to escape " class subjectivism , " thus pro viding us with a putatively objective or scientific knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ( 2 ) by assuming the standpoint of the proletariat , thus allowing us to transcend the class subjectivism of those who , having a great deal more to lose than just their chains , have a vested interest in remaining blind to the sources of their wealth and privilege , the ignominious irrguts of the present regime , and the irra tionality , contingencv , and ttan , rtonness of the status quo. // Both of these ways of claiming superscience status involve revealing the economic class determinants of beliefs , determinants that Marx described in a famous passage from his 1859 " Preface to A Critique of Political Economy " as the " real foundation " to which " definite forms of social consciousness " correspond . Lukacs 's proletariat , for example , is in a position to gain scientific knowledge of its own debasement and the possibility of redemption because , as the objectified subject of history , it is the most thoroughly disillusioned subject heretofore . Rorty might have had some such formulation in mind when he wrote that Ideologiekritik is at the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working class their true situation . " " Against the view that those who remain prisoners of bourgeois class subjectivism remain blinded by ideology , Rorty protests that performing such tasks as sensitizing an audience to cases of suffering that they had not previously noticed is simply a matter of " redescription . " " One way in which the notion of being blinded by ideology differs from " redescription " is that the latter term , unlike the former , is truth-neutral . By Rorty 's lights , then , " the " notion of ideology opposes false imaginings to the real . Accordingly , he criticizes a notion of ideology as : ( a ) False consciousness ; mystification ( Condorcet ) ; socially necessary illusion ; Althusser 's " imaginary version of a real relation " ; " distorted discourse " ( Habermas , Nielsen ) ; Geuss ' " ideology in the pejorative sense , " or what Novosti literature sometimes used to refer to as " illusory ideology , " in contrast to " scientific ideology " The literary output of the vulgar economists exemplifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as do ( arguably ) the fetishism of the commodity and the wage form . This pejorative sense of ideology , however , is only one of several uses to which Marxists and others have put the word . Consider some other meanings of the word , to be found in the works of Marx and/or Marxist writers : ( b ) Constellations of beliefs , attitudes , dispositions , and so on which serve to " mask social contradictions " ; // ( c ) Juridical , philosophical and technical principles of state power , as in the phrases " official ideology " and " the ideology of the state , " or as embodied in , say , Roman law , Shari'a , or the orthodoxy of Stalin 's Russia ; ( d ) Conscious or unconscious rules , based on principles for morality and conduct ; ( e ) * Patterns of behavior ( prominently including linguistic behavior ) , as in Althusser 's formulation , " a lived relation to the world " ; ( f ) Systematic ways of viewing things , in the broadest sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely shared , important , and in some sense highly coherent perceptions or beliefs , as in " the German ideology " ; ( g ) Ideals ; Plekhanov 's " ideology of the higher sort , " consisting of science , philosophy , the arts , and so on ; ( h ) * Noncoercive practices , prominently including linguistic practices , which support the economic system or reproduce dominant relations of production ; ( i ) A social or collective practice distinct from but concerned with ( nonlinguistic ) action ; a collective practice which is " more practical " than philosophy ; 80 ( j ) * A relatively noncoercive field of class conflict or competition for cultural and political hegemony ( as in Gramsci ) ; ( k ) * A social determination which implies a cause , though not a justification . " This list is not intended to be exhaustive . It is not clear to me , for instance , that it can accommodate a view Rorty ascribes to Marx and 1 labermas , according to which " ideology " is contrasted to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human freedom ' rather than any ' external constraints , ' succeeds in being non-ideological . ' The list should suffice , however , to bring home the point that various interpreters and different traditions or schools , Marxist and non-Marxist , have subscribed to different notions of idcologv Rorty is certainly right to observe that // many writers have used " ideology " to mean " bad idea . " Others , however , have provided accounts of ideology that are prefigured in the Marxist classics " ? or for that matter in the works of , say , Karl Mannheim or Talcott Parsons ? and that at the same time avoid the assumption that all contending vocabularies but their own are bad ideas . Consider , for example , the following variation on " functional " definition ( h ) : ( h , ) An attitude , ritual , or set of beliefs , dispositions , or linguistic practices viewed with an eye to its role in the reproduction of dominant relations of production , or alternatively , to its inhibition or subversion of those relations . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items in the list marked with an asterisk , and does not appear to conflict in any obvious way with any other item except ( a ) . ( The reason the recommended definition conflicts with ( a ) is that , in order to fulfill its role in the reproduction of dominant social relations , a belief would thereby serve the purposes of the dominant social group , and thus , at least from a pragmatist 's perspective , the dominant group would not be warranted in asserting that it is false or illusory ) By contrast , Rorty 's characterization of Ideologiekritik does not comport terribly well with any of the items on the list except ( a ) , ( b ) , and possibly ( f ) . " 4 Ideology , according to definition ( h ) , or in the sense of what Geuss called " ideology in a purely descriptive sense , " could include both implicit and explicit discursive elements such as beliefs , concepts , and so on , as well as nondiscursive elements such as rituals , dispositions , attitudes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the habits of loyalty and obedience " that permit a government to rule.NS Thus , ideology as ( h , ) does not appear to be too far from Rorty 's " forms of life , " referred to above , that " . . . have been used to justify the systematic administration of pain and humiliation . " " Ideological attitudes , rituals , beliefs , and so on , constitute and typically are embodied in institutions and institutional practices , both public and private . It will be noted that this conception of ideology trivially proscribes what Nielsen refers to as **26;1232;TOOLONG belie/r : To view a belief ' as legitimizing an institution or political practice is to view it as ideFREEDOM // ology . And the same may be said of a belief that problematizes or challenges prevailing forms of exploitation and domination . Even the most uncontroversially true , pragmatically confirmed axioms can be viewed with an eye to their function vis-a-vis the reproduction of relations of production . Thus , for example , both vulgar political economy and Das Kapital could be viewed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scientificity , or usefulness for a given purpose . If the literary output of the vulgar economists or the fetishism of the commodity or the wage form are more obviously ideological than , say , Euclidean geometry or Boyle 's Law , then this is because of their function vis-a-vis dominant social relations , not because of their alleged cognitive inferiority . Moreover , as Nielsen has pointed out with reference to his own truth-functional conception of ideology , Davidson 's observation about how the mass of mundane beliefs must be true does not impugn the claim that there are systems of legitimating beliefs or discourses that underwrite repressive social orders and reproduce existing relations of exploitation and political domination . " Gramsci 's remarks on ideology are instructive here . The Italian Marxist viewed common sense as comprised of bits and pieces of the ideology of a ruling class at a given moment in its career . At the same time , he recognized that some ? though certainly not all ? widely held beliefs have been pragmatically confirmed by many agents over a long period of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good sense.88 Clearly , there is an overlap of beliefs of good sense and common sense . Thus , we may readily admit that commonsense beliefs are often true , yet still be warranted in asserting that they underwrite existing relations of exploitation and political domination . Ideology , viewed as a social practice along the lines of definition ( h. ) , looks like what a Foucauldian might call " a pluralism of power/discourse formations , " plus nondiscursive attitudes , rituals , and dispositions . Thus conceived , the study of ideology would involve producing lots of what Rorty has called " detailed historical narratives of the sort Foucault offers us , " without positing noncausal conditions of possibility , or constituting the sort of nretanarrative I.votard and Rorty profcss to abhor . ' " ' Ifo view ideology thr wily is not necessarily to subscribe // to Rorty 's picture of Ideologiekritik as " penetrating to the repressed ' reality behind the ideological ' appearances . ' " Nor need the examination of ideology depend in any obvious way ? nor , as far as I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? on the opposition between " true consensus " and " false consensus , " or between " validity " and " power , " either . " Rather , it could be described simply as a particular sort of firstorder descriptive activity , one that consists of generating claims about the effects of discourse , rituals , and so on , as well as the purposes , and hence communities , that are served or frustrated by our ways of talking . Students of ideology so conceived would qualify as naturalists , in Rorty 's sense of the word , as those who believe that all explanation is causal explanation of the actual , and that there is no such thing as a noncausal condition of possibility . ) " Rorty has written that the genre of literature concerned with " unmasking bourgeois ideology " has long been overworked. ? ' It is hard to disagree with his derogatory assessment of the impenetrable and pretentious jargon of many " cultural leftists , " and he is probably right to doubt that they create so much as a ripple outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , a great deal remains to be said about how , say , public school curricula , packaged news , or clinical psychology have either helped to reproduce prevailing social relations or have been appropriated by social forces in opposition to those relations . The same observation applies to religious and nationalist creeds , advertising and popular entertainment , a wide range of technical discourses , commonsense platitudes , and , yes , even Marvel Comics . So when in a rare moment Rorty describes " critique of ideology " as an " occasionally useful tactical weapon in social struggles , but as one among many others , " ? ' we may dispute his use of the adverb occasionally , but otherwise agree with him . In this chapter , I have sketched a picture in which both state and nonstate institutions in the liberal North Atlantic , on the whole , function to reproduce prevailing economic and political relations by producing // individuals as private , as well as public , persons or selves . In the course of sketching this picture , I have not invoked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autonomy . I have made my case , rather , by comparing the scope , scale , and forms of state power within the rich North Atlantic democracies to other cases , notably in Eastern Europe during the cold war . If this account is on target , then existing liberal democracies could hardly be said to embody one of Rorty 's highest liberal ideals , namely , the ideal of leaving people alone to pursue their own idiosyncratic visions of personal perfection . In the next chapter I will turn to Rorty 's public ideal of amelio-rating suffering . I will argue that if we give proper attention to the poli-cies and practices of the richest North Atlantic democracies beyond their cartographic borders , they fare no better when it comes to this ideal than they did with reference to the ideal of individual freedom . I will also recommend an alternative political setup which , I believe , holds greater promise when it comes to ameliorating suffering . CHAPTER FOUR DECENCY AND LIBERALISM IN PRACTICE I f we are to believe Rorty , America will go down in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far to promote what Sidney Hook called the cause of " enlarging human freedom in a precarious and tragic world by the arts of intelligent social control . " ' This prognostication , of course , is probably on target , at least in the medium run . As Rorty reminds us , " To say that we think we 're heading in the right direction is just to say , with Kuhn , that we can , by hindsight , tell the story of the past as a story of progress . " ' Judging from more than ample evidence past and present , however , telling such a story is little more than a perfunctory gesture that may accompany indefinitely large volume displacements of the blood and tears of innocents . The historiographies to which most people are exposed , after all , are written for , if not entirely by , the victors : As a rule , the victors , their heirs and scribes are the " we " who spin stories of the past as histories of progress . // Judging from the context in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be taken not as an observation about the politics of historiography , but as a congratulatory statement about the exemplary moral status of the United States of America and other " rich North Atlantic democracies . " By his lights , these countries represent the best hope for propagating the ideals of freedom from the constraints of the state and amelioration of suffering . As we have seen , these are the highest private and public aims of strong poets and decent citizens , respectively . As ideals they figure prominently in Rorty 's definitions of a liberal community as " one which has no purpose except freedom , " ' and of a liberal as a person for whom cruelty is the worst thing we do . In the previous chapter , by contrast , we saw that in existing liberal democracies such as the United States , freedom from the supervision and sway of state institutions is narrowly circumscribed . This consideration casts serious doubt on the claim that the United States has contributed notably to the cause of enlarging human freedom within its cartographic borders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the most powerful liberal democracies have done a notably good job of ameliorating suffering beyond their borders . This will complete the negative side of my indictment of his description of actually existing liberalism . To make the case that the most powerful contemporary liberal democracies continually promote massive tyranny and suffering abroad , however , is not enough to compromise Rorty 's paraphrase of Churchill , to the effect that the existing liberal democracies are the worst political setups imaginable , with the exception of all the other candidates . ' Defenders of these liberal democracies could always claim , as they have done , that any realizable alternative to liberal democracy in its present form would result in even more tyranny and suffering . As Rorty has emphasized , public criticism gains force by virtue of contrast effects . The effect may be achieved by comparing a past or present state of affairs invidiously with another actual state of affairs , or a past or present state of affairs invidiously with a particular utopian vision , or one utopia invidiously with another . The case of Foucault may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciates the late French author as an ironist theorist who is useful fir tracing the // blind impresses our individual behavings bear . However , he dismisses Foucault as a public thinker , in part because the author of Surveiller et punir ( Discipline and Punishment ) was unwilling or unable to offer an alternative vision to the pervasive disciplinary regimes he described . Acknowledging Rorty 's challenge , then , I will make the case toward the end of the first section of this chapter that it is possible to imagine a political setup that would be more conducive to the aim of ameliorating pain than mere preservation and piecemeal reform of existing liberal institutions and practices . In the second section , I will argue that , pace Rorty , existing liberal democracies do not contain the institutions necessary for improvement along these lines . If my account is on the mark , it will cast a bad light on Rorty 's claim that existing liberal democracies are conducive to the liberal ideal of ameliorating suffering . LIBERALISM AND SUFFERING It is , of course , all too easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , for and in the name of liberalism . Basil Davidson , Noam Chomsky , Eduardo Galeano , and lots of other writers have described the emergence of the liberal democracies as a long litany of slavery , pillage , and genocide . And even if we purge from these accounts all depredations committed during the course of primitive accumulation and high colonialism , and concentrate only on the twentieth century , the list of horrors remains very lengthy indeed . Rorty certainly does not emphasize the causal connections between these depredations and the existing liberal democracies . But he does not dispute the claim that genocide , pillage , and slavery were conditions of actuality of liberalism as it has come down to us today , either . ' Nor does he provide any reason to doubt that claim . Moreover , he acknowledges that liberal ideals of universal freedom and equality continue to be betrayed in contemporary liberal democracies . He is even prepared to concede that they are constantly betrayed . ' Ile also acknowledges from time to time that the same liberal democratic governments that promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in fact have done so . Ile admits , for // example , that poverty in Latin America is " partially due to the deals struck between local plutocracies and North American banks and governments . " ' Thus , he would not subscribe to the first premise in the following simplistic but familiar argument : P , : Any political system which pursues a brutal and exploitative foreign policy can not be liberal ;   : The U.S. political system is liberal ; Therefore , by modus tollens , etc . Yet he remains unflinchingly committed to both liberalism and existing liberal democracies . ' In view of these observations , the question arises : How can Rorty remain a liberal , in Shklar 's sense of the word as " one who believes that cruelty is the worst thing we do , " while remaining unflinchingly committed to the institutions and practices of actually existing liberalism ? Rorty avers a response to this question : In addition to the horrors they have produced , the liberal societies of our century have produced more and more people who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they state their highest hopes ? the contingency of their own consciences ? and yet have remained faithful to those consciences . ' Such recognition , he adds on the same page , is the chief virtue of those who make up a liberal public . Over the past two centuries , these people have created institutions and practices ? free presses , independent judiciaries , legal assemblies , representative political institutions , free universities , and so on ? that have helped to abolish such practices as chattel slavery , child labor , direct colonial domination , and racial segregation . To advocate destroying or superseding these liberal institutions and practices would amount to condemning instruments that have proven to be effective in mitigating cruelty and humiliation . Because the liberal institutions that exist in some parts of the globe ( preeminently , as it turns out , in the countries that benefited most from genocide , // slavery , and pillage in the past ) are a means of ensuring that ongoing horrors will be ameliorated , their continued existence may be viewed as a cony pensation for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view of the magnitude of those horrors , but it is compensation nevertheless . In AOC , Rorty builds a case along these lines for renewed hope fir American liberalism . His case comports with the following two assuntp tions about liberal institutions : ( i ) Free presses , independent judiciaries , and the other liberal insti tutions we have mentioned are compatible with any of a number of dif ferent political and economic setups . We can have these liberal institu tions without the horrors committed by , for , and in their name . Fur thermore , there is no " deep link between capitalism and democracy " or other liberal institutions , nor for that matter between " central econonti ( planning and tyranny . " 10 ( ii ) Not only are these liberal institutions useful as a means of ; tile liorating horrors , but they are the best means at hand for doing so . Neither opponents of liberalism nor anyone else have provided alternatives to extant liberal institutions that realistically could he expected to do a better job of ameliorating these horrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup , but it is less unattractive than any other candidate . fl If these two assumptions stand , Rorty has produced a contpellint defense of actually existing liberalism against its detractors to his left At best , " radical " opposition to liberalism would appear to be a point less exercise in resentment . And at worst , it could , under some circuit stances , come close to reckless endangerment of fragile but supremely precious institutions . As one might have guessed from the discussion of socialism and privatization in the previous chapter , assumption ( i ) appears to he y ell taken . Even if critics of liberalism were to succeed in showing the dependence of actually existing liberalism on betrayal of liberal ideals , they would not have succeeded in showing counterfactually that it this Connection were broken liberal institutions could not be sustained . The observation that ex-colonial powers such as ( ; rear Britain , the Nether lands , and France managed to retain their liberal institutions itt the post colonial era might cast additional doubt on this . With reference to the ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Whereas liberals think of these evils as eventually reformable , radicals are concerned to show that they are somehow integral ' to liberal society . ' A radical , for Rorty , is a person who harbors no hope of improving existing liberal democracies in a piecemeal fashion . If such people turn out to be right , removing these evils will require things being changed utterly , including replacing or destroying ? rather than reforming ? some important institutions in the liberal West . Among these institutions we may count a corporate-dominated " free press , " electoral systems that favor the candidates of big business , reformist unions with promanagement bureaucracies , and , of course , " the market economy " ? that is , capitalism . These are the sorts of sweeping changes advocated by what Rorty refers to as movements , in contrast to campaigns focusing on piecemeal reform of specific institutions and practices . The radicals hold that , as Richard Bernstein has put it , There are forces and tendencies at work , ( e.g. , class conflict , social division , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices but nevertheless foster real inequality and limit effective political freedom . ' ' Rorty 's likely response to this might be to agree with Bernstein 's claim , but to point out that other forces and tendencies compatible with liberal practices are in place , too ? forces and tendencies such as those already noted , which foster equality and expand political freedom . For reasons already mentioned , this is a plausible response . Bernstein , however , has raised the stakes : It is not merely that the institutions and practices of actually existing liberalism are compatible with inequality and political unfreedom ; nor is it merely that the former are results at least in part of past horrors . Rather , the former continue to foster inequality and unfreedom as a condition of their actuality . As Bernstein has put it , " the structural dynamics of bourgeois society systematically undermine and belie liberal ideals . " With reference to the manner in which liberal ideals are betrayed , the difference between Bernstein 's adverb systematically and Rorty 's constantly is pivotal . Bernstein 's adverb implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort , whereas Rorty 's need imply little more than frequent occurrence . Rorty evidently takes the adverb " systematically " to designate a relationship of final causality or transcendental conditionality . He might well view the " structural dynamics " allegedly responsible for the systematicity of the betrayal as synonymous with " essence , " and as yet another example of the spurious discovery by theoreticians of " underlying structures " or " something deep down , " a taproot to be eradicated . He is likely to dismiss the notion of any " dynamics of bourgeois society " as yet another " large theoretical construct " purporting to unmask what is really going on , a construct of the sort that Ideologiekritik is alleged to provide . ' 4 By inveighing against exploitation , class conflict , and imperialism as examples of " deep processes " that theoreticians like to invoke , but that allegedly make no discernible difference to the conduct of public affairs , he thereby preempts consideration of the hypothesis that there is a causal connection between exploitation or imperialism on the one hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to acknowledge that " liberal ideals of universal freedom and equality are constantly betrayed in bourgeois capitalist societies , " as Bernstein put it , while ignoring the question ( which David Hall notes Rorty never raises ) whether his goals of social justice and amelioration of suffering are at all likely to be attained under capitalism . Rorty can lament the shortsightedness of high officeholders in the rich North Atlantic and the greed of middle-class suburbanites , while never raising the question whether his utopian hope for capitalism with a human face is anything more than a will-o ' - the- wisp . For Rorty the historical nominalist , each individual instance of betrayal of liberal ideals has ( efficient ) causes . It is the task of the social engineer and the piecemeal reformer to identify these causes on a caseby-case basis and to eliminate or modify them one by one . A free press , free universities , and other liberal institutions play a crucial role in the performance of this task . In this way , liberal institutions gradually mitigate the betrayal of liberal ideals . These considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolster the second assuntptit n mentioned above , namely that liberal institutions are the best means at hand bit ameliorating the horrors coin142 RICHARD RORTY 'S POLITICS mitted by and for existing liberal regimes . If this assumption stands , it serves as a strong support for Rorty 's claim that " Nothing is more important than the preservation of these liberal institutions . ' There is a parallel here between the institutions and practices of liberalism on the one hand and " technology " on the other . In response to a correspondent 's observation that much of the poverty of the Third World is caused by the West , Rorty impertinently writes : " My hunch is that more Western science and technology is about the only thing that can cope with the results of prior Western science and technology " ' 6 Only more modern technology , not less , will remedy environmental pollution , diminishing resources , toxic waste disposal , and other evils regularly laid at the door of the rich North Atlantic democracies . Rorty 's techno-panacean views chime with maneuvers by protransnational corporate bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GATT ) , which tie access to the latest technologies to the production of " favorable investment climates " in the South . He hardly dispels this impression with such revealingly confused remarks as : " The reliance on Marxism on the part of the people trying to overthrow Third World oligarchies seems to me potentially as dangerous as their grandparents ' reliance on the United Fruit Company or Anaconda Copper . " Rorty acknowledges that liberal institutions often function as tools of local oligarchs . Nevertheless , he claims , if the conditions of actuality of liberalism have so far undermined and belied liberal ideals , then these conditions can and should be identified , one by one , and either reformed or replaced . This replacement , however , need not and should not involve the rejection or abandonment of liberal institutions already in place . As he puts it , " ... the principal institutions of contemporary democratic societies do not require unmasking ' but rather strenuous utilization , supplemented by luck . " Unfortunately , liberal institutions are prey to a number of dangers , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wirtschaft and Gesellschaft ) , part 3 . In addition , in times of sweeping social change liberal institutions have been among the first things to be swept away . Liberal institutions and practices have been easy targets for demagogues , who in times of crisis have focused on cases of abuse and inefficiency to transfi , rm these institutions and pracDECENCY // tices into targets of popular discontent . By inhibiting their operation , demagogues have removed obstacles to their own unchecked authoritarian rule . These observations only underscore the preciousness of these " fragile , flawed institutions . " Their fragility and preciousness only make it more imperative to take care to preserve them . Thus , nothing prohibits Rorty from recognizing that , like the public/private split , liberal institutions also are fortuitous accidents of time and chance , while at the same time he holds that nothing is more worthy of our unflinching allegiance . Without wishing to dispute Rorty 's characterization of liberal institutions as precious , I believe nevertheless that a liberal , as Judith Shklar defines one , could plausibly deny his unqualified assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of making this point in the balance of this chapter , I will assume that no institution , liberal or otherwise , should be viewed in isolation from its larger social context . In order to evaluate whether or not contemporary liberal institutions in fact do ameliorate suffering , we should take special care to examine the larger context of state power and global capitalism . THE SOLEMN COMPLEMENT OF RORTY 'S IDEALS Another reason Rorty can not accommodate the suggestion that liberal institutions be recast within the context of working-class state power is that , as he has made clear in more recent writings , he is committed not merely to the several liberal institutions mentioned above , but also to " the institutions of large market economies . " " Large market economies , " he believes , constitute the " economic determinants " of liberal democracies : The North Atlantic has achieved its measure of decency and equality by relying on " a free market in capital and on compromises between pressure groups . " ' " In this respect , he is once again backing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position closer to that of the English classical liberals who associated liberty with laissez-faire economic policies . // Rorty sidesteps questions about exploitation , class domination , and managerial despotism at the work site . Nor has he much to say about the enormous concentration of capital in fewer and fewer hands in his " large market economies , " or the merging of corporate and state power , or the repercussions of what I have referred to as globali.rm on the notion of government by consent . And even after Achieving Our Country , he does not seem particularly cognizant of the impact , on cities and on the planet as a whole , of what Hall has called the capitalist celebration of " the multiplication of desires and their transmogrification into needs . " ' " Although he has little to say , even in passing , about these defects of " large market economies , " he does identify one or two of its drawbacks : Capitalism , notably , breeds greed and inequality . Still , he can think of no better way to mitigate the greed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare state , together with good will and the patience to muddle through campaigns for piecemeal reform . As luck would have it , the liberal democracies themselves have produced decent public citizens with the requisite patience , toleration , and good will . ' - ' The allegedly greater ability of members of liberal democracies to enlarge their conception of " us " is itself the result of institutions internal to liberal democracies . The greater freedom and decreased pain for which liberal institutions and practices deserve credit compensates for the greed and inequality they spawn , as well as the constraints Foucault associated with them.22 Indeed , the existence of these institutions is reason enough to hope that the rich North Atlantic democracies may prefigure " the utopian world community envisaged by the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki Declaration of Human Rights . " - " Lamentably , bourgeois capitalist society is " irrelevant to most of the problems for most of the population of the planet . "  --  " Rorty decries the impossibility of feeding countries like Haiti and Chad except by massive charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the unbreakable grip of the rich or the military on the governments of most of the Third World . " Continuing in this vein , he invokes Robert Kaplan 's " memorable " image of " people like ourselves  --  middle-class American and European readDECENCY // ers of magazines like Dissent " riding in " a stretch limousine , making its way through a mob of ragged and desperate people moving in the opposite direction . " " Kaplan 's way of describing our situation , " Rorty goes on to explain , amounts to saying that while Europe and America have been worrying about how to go forward from capitalism , a lot of the rest of the world has been hoping to advance to feudalism . ' With a bit of nominalism at this point , one might conclude that there are plenty of ragged and desperate people in Europe and America , too . Surely it is significant , moreover , that among the most ragged and des perate people outside of Europe and America are those subjected not to some prefeudal regime , but to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and superexploiting megalopolies . Kaplan 's image , conjuring up as it does a homogeneously affluent " us " and a hot no geneously ragged and desperate " other , " does little to advance Ron vs professed aim to de-essentialize the West , " to break up the lump . Rorty 's ( rather selective ) disparagement of those who , he says , are constantly on the lookout for " something deep down ' ? something ahis torical and international , " 28 together with Kaplan 's image of limousines and ragged mobs passing each other in opposite directions , complement the claim that bourgeois capitalism is irrelevant to most of the globe . It would be easy to challenge this view , of course . One might point out , for example , that the IMF , the World Bank , and the World Trade Organization ? G-7-dominated institutions that advertise themselves as advancing the ideals of liberal democracy ? explicitly have " planetary projects " of their own , including most recently the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Multilateral Agreement on Investments . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oli gopolies and strategic planners in the leading capitalist centers most assuredly subsume theirhopes2 " ? are instances of centralized cc-mum ) i ( planning on a global scale . " ' Rorty 's insouciance on this point has prompted one commentator to score his " skepticism concerning ' meta narratives ' that disas oss s the movement of world spirit but that seems w illfully ignorant of the mocenarnt of ' World capital . // In AOC , Rorty has managed , at long last , to acknowledge " the globalization of the labor market ? a trend which can reasonably be expected to accelerate indefinitely . ' " A century and a half earlier , however , Marx and Engels described with astonishing accuracy trends that Rorty would only get around to registering in the late 1990s . The twenty-odd pages of the Communist Manifesto bristle with descriptions of " a cosmopolitan character of production and consumption in every country " ; of " new wants , requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes " ; of " intercourse in every direction , universal interdependence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication " ; of " an epidemic that , in all earlier epochs would have seemed an absurdity ? the epidemic of overproduction " ; and of " that single unconscionable freedom ? Free Trade . " These phrases from section 1 of the Manifesto could be headlines from tomorrow morning 's Wall Street Journal . Other passages read like clippings from the latest " postie " journals : Capitalist development , according to Marx and Engels , brings with it a " constant revolutionizing of production , uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions , everlasting uncertainty and agitation . " " All fixed , fast-frozen relations , with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions , are swept away , " Marx and Engels wrote , " all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify . All that is solid melts into air , all that is holy is profaned . " " Modern bourgeois society , " according to the Manifesto , " is like the sorcerer , who is no longer able to control the power of the nether world which he has called up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up with " too much civilization , too much means of subsistence , too much industry , too much commerce . " According to Rorty , " What industrialization was to America at the end of the nineteenth century , globalization is at the end of the twentieth . " " Marx and Engels , by contrast , drew a vivid picture of how , at the beginning of the modern age , capitalism set into motion both " modern industry " and " the world market . " Their account in 1848 could hardly be further from Rorty 's contention that bourgeois capitalism is irrelevant to " the rest of the world , " which , at the end of the twentieth century , is still hoping to advance feudalism . These considerations notwithstanding , and inadequate " foreign assistance " aside , Rorty praises the liberal West tin- its readiness to emDECENCY // brace an ever more inclusive conception of community . By his lights , as we have seen , " contemporary democratic societies are already organized around the need for continual exposure of suffering and injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture of recent times has found a strategy for avoiding the disadvantage of ethnocentrism . This is to be open to encounters with actual and possible cultures , and to make this openness central to its self-image . " By fostering an ever broader recognition of suffering and injustice , liberal institutions make possible the kind of dialogue with foreigners that helps extend solidarity beyond the borders of existing liberal democracies.36 This ever more inclusive conception of a public " we " increases with education , just as the number of communities with which an inhabitant of a rich North Atlantic democracy may identify increases with civilization . Unfortunately , liberal intellectuals do not always manifest a concern to make sure that their fellow citizens notice suffering when it occurs . Far from it . Edward Said has observed that the amazing thing about the fact that the United States continues to try through force and threats to dictate its views about law and peace all over the globe , " is not that it is attempted , but that it is done with so much consensus and near unanimity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressly to represent and explain it . Rorty himself does not exactly disrupt this consensus , as anyone may confirm by reading " Thugs and Theorists , " " The Priority of Democracy to Philosophy , " " The End of Leninism , " much of EH , part 3 of CIS , and AOC . Even when Balslev , Bernstein , and others have directly challenged him to take measure of the demonstrable connection between the domestic political stability of the liberal democracies and the violence they engender abroad , he has demurred . Referring to his colleagues in university humanities departments , Said has written : " There is , I believe , a quite serious split in our critical consciousness wdav , v hich allows us to spend a great deal of time elaborating Car148 RICHARD RORTY 'S POLITICS lyle and Ruskin 's aesthetic theories , for example , without giving attention to the authority that their ideas simultaneously bestowed on the subjugation of inferior peoples and colonial territories . " Rorty has enjoined us to stop worrying about " which theorists to pair off with which thugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold war East , however , he appears willing to accept that some theorists are thugs , not merely contingently , in the manner perhaps of Heidegger at the University of Heidelberg , but in their very capacity as theorists ' ? It should be noted , however , that if we substitute " moral and political " for " aesthetic " in the passage just cited , Said 's observation applies equally well to Carlyle and Ruskin 's contemporary , J. S. Mill , and Mill 's admirer Isaiah Berlin . According to Berlin , the younger Mill opposed the dissolution of the East India Company because " he feared the dead hand of Government more than the paternalist and not inhumane rule of the Company 's officials . " " A number of writers have presented a rather different picture of East India Company rule . " If the latter writers are even close to the mark , Berlin and Rorty have spent time elaborating Mill and Berlin 's political views while overlooking the authority that their ideas simultaneously have bestowed on the subjugation of inferior peoples and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony in favor of Rorty 's claim that contemporary liberal democracies are already organized around the need for continual exposure of suffering and injustice . Instances of liberal institutions ( including " free presses " and " free universities " ) concealing massive suffering and injustice could be cited indefinitely . One further example , however , should suffice to cast serious doubt on Rorty 's claim just mentioned : In consideration of their usefulness in the war against Communism , U.S. officials and more than one administration for decades protected from prosecution high-ranking Japanese military and political leaders , up to and including Emperor Hirohito himself . These leaders were responsible for the deaths of more than twenty million people in China between the years 1931 and 1945 . Thus , a leading liberal democracy played an important role in helping to whitewash one of the most horrendous holocausts in recorded history , measured in absolute numbers of victims : ' ' True , this holocaust eventually has come to the attention of an Anierican audience larger than a handful of scholars . However , in view of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and a shift in U.S. ? Chinese relations ? for this to happen , the 1wle d recognition could hardly be said to redeem Rorty 's pictttu ill Itltrnall institutions continually exposing suffering and injustice . This example highlights a problem with Rorty 's " thin " notion of community as a voluntary association , " one more of Nature 's ' espett ments. " ' 4 ' This problem has less to do with its alleged thinness or t1 11k ness than with its broadness or narrowness . In one respect , Port ' notion of community is too broad : As we have already noted with refer ence to class divisions within the North Atlantic democracies , he runs roughshod over existing conflicts , predatory relationships , and political domination within the formations he defines as communities . Ile assumes not only that the diverse impulses that animate the liberal democracies can be harmonized into common purposes , but that they can be identified as " our European purposes . " *h Noting this , Fraser asks why we should assume , as Rorty does , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a single monolithic and all-encompassing solidarity ? " 1 ' Why , she asks , should we not assume instead " a quasi-Marxian view according to which modern capitalist societies contain a plurality of overlapping and competing solidarities " ? As a good pluralist , of course , Rorty would agree that the liberal democracies contain a plurality of overlapping and competing solidarities . Clearly , however , Fraser is referring to com-peting solidarities that are distinguishable on the basis of a predatory relationship , such as that between exploiter and exploited , or perpe-trator of violence and target of violence . Perhaps the most obvious response to Fraser 's question is tied up with Rorty 's " we 's , " discussed above . The reason " we " should not assume Fraser 's " quasi-Marxian view " is that such a view makes it more difficult to mount apologetics for bourgeois liberal democracy . As Said has noted , with reference to the all-important " we , " this pronoun , almost more than any other word , fortifies the some-what illusory sense that all americans , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commit America to its far-flung fitreign interventions . " // When , in AOC , Rorty writes of the need to foster of new sense of American national pride , rather than identity-group pride ? and , one might add , as opposed to working-class pride ? he runs the risk of feeding into the illusion Said has described . In another respect , Rorty 's notion of community is too narrow : Communities in the rich North Atlantic that establish ties of solidarity abroad have not always done so by first expanding their sense of solidarity to all or even most of their fellow citizens . Often , a community will demonstrate greater solidarity with " foreigners " than with their fellow citizens . In part 1 of his book Solidarity in the Conversation of Humankind , for example , Norman Geras cites many instances of " the righteous of the nations " in central and eastern Europe risking their lives to save supposed foreigners from Nazi persecution . But solidarity with " foreigners " in the face of the apathy or resistance of one 's fellow citizens is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups within the rich North Atlantic joining hands with the wretched of the earth , in opposition to " our European purposes . " On the other side of the fence , corporate officers and top managements of G-7-based transnational corporations continue to join with their brokers in the South to move production facilities to cheaper labor markets , in the face of working-class opposition at home , and foreign policy officers in the North collaborate with their counterparts in the South to create " favorable climates for investment " that result in higher unemployment and lower wages in the North and deeper burdens of debt , urban poverty , and pollution in the South . These examples might suffice to make the point that Rorty 's " quasi-Durkheimian view " is not well suited for describing the reality of transnational capitalist class solidarity at the close of the American Century . Maurice Merleau-Ponty noted that " It is not just a question of knowing what the liberals have in mind but what in reality is done by the liberal state within and beyond its frontiers . " 41 Rorty the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words " Marxists " and " socialist " were substituted for " liberals " and " liberal . " As one critic has noted , however , when it comes to evaluating liberalism , Rorty " ... tends to downplay what has become a major problem fin- liberals , viz. // the disparity between the " ideals " of liberty and equality that liberals profess and the actual state of affairs in so-called liberal societies . ' " s " As we have already noted , Rorty concedes that the existing liberal democracies constantly fall short of their ideals . One important reason for this is that , as he writes in a paper published in the waning years of Gorbachev 's tenure , the social democratic scenario of steady reform along increasingly egalitarian lines ... has been stalled for decades , largely because the political right within the First World ( made up of the people who have no interest in increasing equality ) diverted public attention , money , and energy to combating Soviet imperialism . " " Soviet imperialism , " Rorty hastens to add in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this account is at all in the ballpark , then with the disappearance of the Soviet threat , and all other things being equal , one would have expected to see " moderates " or " the political center " within the victorious First World seize the initiative : One would have expected at minimum to see signs of the resurrection of Rorty 's social democratic scenario , of the expansion of the so-called welfare state , of " steady reform along increasingly egalitarian lines . " In view of Reagan 's enormous military buildup in the 1980s ( a buildup that Reagan promoted by conjuring the image of the Evil Empire ) , for example , one might have expected in the post ? cold war era to have seen deep cuts in military spending , and perhaps the reallocation of tax revenue from " defense " to education , health care , environmental protection , and so on . One might have expected at least to have seen some sort of more or less substantial " peace dividend . " One certainly would not have expected to see hundred-billion-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater spending on the CIA , cuts in nonmilitary " foreign aid , " and the sweeping dismantlement of domestic social programs in the United States , England , Italy , France , and other leading liberal democracies . What we have witnessed , however , is the latter scenario , not the fiinner . In the wake of the cold war , there has been not a decrease but an increase of inequalities of wealth and opportunity within the United // States and other liberal democracies , along with exacerbated inequalities between North and South . More recently , Rorty has registered the calamity ? at least judging from his description in AOC of a supernational dystopia run by a conspiratorial Orwellian Inner Party , with the support of a bribed and privileged " overclass . " " Strangely , however , at a time of almost undisputed U.S. " world leadership , " hundred-billiondollar weapons systems , and U.S. military interventions on four continents , Rorty has lamented " the postwar failure of American nerve , " and " the loss of America 's hope to lead the nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign countries has dropped 40 percent in real terms since the end of the cold war ( one should keep in mind that during the cold war the United States devoted one of the smallest percentages of GDP of any highly industrialized country to such " aid " ) . U.S. arms exports , however , rose to over 60 percent of total arms exports globally ? even before the announcement in the summer of 1997 of new sales of warplanes and high-tech weapons systems in Latin America . It has long been conceded even by observers in the West that the prospect of Soviet retaliation served to chasten U.S. leaders when it came to decisions whether or not to launch nuclear strikes against Korea , China , and North Vietnam . And it is hardly less controversial that the fear of expanding Soviet influence spurred the Marshall Plan and a host of other ambitious foreign aid projects in Asia , the Middle East , and Latin America , and helped to accelerate the postwar decolonization of Africa and much of Asia . As soon as the Soviet bogey dematerialized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to pious sermonizing about the salutary effects of entrepreneurship , " free markets , " and " tough love . " America , " the nuclear superpower which halted the spread of an Evil Empire , " has never less resembled " the leader of an international movement to replace oligarchy with social democracy around the world . " " Turning to the domestic scene , a convincing case could be made that some of the most consequential initiatives benefiting the most disadvantaged at home were , at least in large part , responses to the threat of militancy on the home front , as well as fear of the expanding influ ence of Bolshevism . These initiatives included the New Deal , social security , corporate income tax , civil rights legislation , and the reveal ingly entitled National Defense Education and National Defense // Highway Acts . As soon as the struggle against Communism at home and abroad abated , however , many of the most celebrated achievements of the so-called welfare state were revoked . A host of social programs have been slashed at home , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax burden has shifted ever more squarely onto the shoulders of the working class . These developments , moreover , have taken place despite propitious circumstances for Rorty 's social democratic scenario , including a liberal Democratic administration in Washington , D.C. , quiescent leaders in the South , and an abjectly subservient regime in the Kremlin . These trends , then , do not appear to have been caused because the institutions of liberal democracy are fragile or vulnerable . On the contrary , liberal democracy in practice has been least amenable to self-improvement along the lines Rorty suggests and has diverged most sharply from his liberal ideals precisely when it has found itself without threats from either the Evil Empire abroad or the Militant Tendency at home . There is strong empirical evidence , then , to doubt Rorty 's claim that " . . . contemporary liberal society already contains the institutions for its own improvement . " sh Indeed , if the lessons of the past are any guide , the case could be made that the best hope for the resurrection of the socalled welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of popular insurrection at home or abroad . Rorty advises us to concede Fukayama 's point that , if you still long for total revolution , for the Radically Other on a worldhistorical scale , the events of 1989 show that you are out of luck . Fukayama suggested , and I should agree , that no more romantic prospect stretches before the left than an attempt to create bourgeois democratic welfare states , and to equalize life-chances among the citizens of those states by redistributing the surplus produced by market economies . " Leaving romance aside , events since 1989 have shown that , if you still long for " capitalism with a human face , " you would appear to be out of ' luck , too . As we have seen , the " social democratic scenario " has , to a large extent , consisted not of self- reforming liberal institutions but of forced concessions in the face of fiireign and domestic opposition . And // as the perceived threat to capitalism has disappeared in the final years of the American Century , so have the liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vindicated Marxists on yet another point upon which just a few years earlier there had been a near unanimous consensus that they were wrong . Of course , these observations , taken singly or in combination , do not prove that existing liberal democracies systematically undermine and belie liberal ideals . If this claim is to be corroborated , then the burden of proof still lies with the critics of liberalism . They must identify the dynamics that belie liberal ideals , explain how they work , and argue that they make a big difference . Moreover , by the very nature of the question , they must do this on a case-by-case basis , building up enough of a body of evidence to justify a generalization about bourgeois society as a whole . If they fail to do this , then we are justified , at most , in withholding judgment . It may not be an easy task to meet this burden of proof . But it is not necessarily a transcendental task , either . Surely it is possible to determine ? in a first-order , nontranscendental sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalist class rule and imperialism are compatible with liberal political practices but nevertheless foster inequality and cruelty and limit effective political freedom . Rorty 's public vocabulary may not be particularly well suited to this task . " Fortunately , however , alternative vocabularies are available , and at least one of these alternative vocabularies , namely the one introduced in chapter 3 , does not involve specifying transcendental conditions of anything at all . Describing the international scene in this vocabulary , it becomes apparent that massive violence and exploitation have constituted not only causal conditions for the appearance of the liberal democracies , but conditions of their ongoing actuality . Merleau-Ponty 's observation continues to be as poignant in the final years of the American Century as it was in 1947 : Judging from history and by everyday events , liberal ideals belong to a system of violence which , as Marx said , are the " spiritual pointd'Gonneur , " the " solemn complement " and the " general basis of consolation and justification . // DECENCY BEYOND LIBERALISM We have already granted that , at least to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter of fact mitigated the ongoing depredations committed by , for , or in the name of liberalism . Nevertheless , in view of the sheer scale , persistence , and frequency of these depredations , it should not be surprising that some parties ? especially the targets and victims themselves ? have come to suspect that there must be more efficacious means of ameliorating suffering than those of the rich North Atlantic democracies . Rorty , however , claims that neither the " radical " opponents of liberalism nor anyone else has offered a workable alternative to liberalism that would be better at ameliorating pain and making the scene safe for strong poets . For one thing , few of these left-wing opponents , except the Marxists among them , have registered any notable success at even tabling a sustainable program for sweeping social change in the twentieth century . Moreover , the alleged attempt of Marxists to abolish private property ? a proposal that Rorty describes as " just about the only constructive suggestion Marx made " 60 ? did not work . This record of failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up to be a socialist , I no longer want to nationalize the means of production ( because the experience of Central and Eastern Europe suggests that nationalization is , to put it mildly , no help in redistributing wealth and power ) . I suspect we are stuck with market economies ? which means with private property ? for the foreseeable future . ' On those occasions when Rorty acknowledges that the word " socialism " has a use ? and as we have seen , he sometimes advocates abandoning the term ? he uses it to mean something like " attempts to fmster institutions conducive to liberal aims . " He contrasts this with what he ( perhaps under the influence of Kolakowski ) apparently takes to be a Marxist use of the word , to designate " nationalization of industry " or abolition of private propertv . It is worth noting that the experience of the 1990s has , " to put it // mildly , " cast suspicion on Rorty 's suspicion about nationalization and redistribution of wealth : At the date of this writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union in which de-nationalization of the means of production has not coincided with ever wider disparities of wealth and deeper poverty for the majority . Setting these doubts aside , however , Rorty prefers Alan Ryan 's suggestion that the best we can hope for is " a kind of **35;1260;TOOLONG , not easy to distinguish from a socialism ' with a big role for private capital and individual entrepreneurs . " 63 It should be pointed out , however , that the two " isms " that Ryan 's hope invokes would not be hard to distinguish if one were to define socialism as state power of workers rather than capitalists . As we have seen , however , Rorty does not wish to draw sharp distinctions along class lines or to emphasize political domination . To do so would clash with his Deweyan vision of the Great Community as a voluntary association of publics united by shared interests . It might even raise the question of the legitimacy of capitalist class rule in the rich North Atlantic . As we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political landscape with , at best , pointless resentment . He expresses the hope that our successors in the next century will agree that " history is an endless network of changing relationships , without any great big climactic ruptures or peripities. " 64 Rorty gives the impression that , by dismissing the Marxist competition , he has dispensed with all programs for abrupt , sweeping change that need to be taken seriously . Foucault , who is sometimes described as an anarchist , offers little or nothing in the way of an alternative to liberalism . Various brands of " progressive nationalism " have either felicitously resolved themselves into liberalism ( as in , say , India , the Philippines , or Tanzania ) or ? more typically ? have been commandeered by thugs ( or both , as in , say , Mexico , Algeria , or Egypt ) . Unger might represent a more attractive option , but he is working within the liberal tradition . Whether or not Rorty is right on this point , there is reason to believe that he has not in fact dispatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to the abolition of private ownership of the means of production , of course , Marx made at least one other suggestion which many people have considered to be constructive : Front the Communist // Manifesto ( 1848 ) to the Critique of the Gotha Program ( 1875 ) , he insisted that the first step in working class revolution is , as he and Engels put it in the Manifesto , " to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class , to win the battle of democracy " With this in mind , an obvious response to Rorty 's defense of liberal institutions could be : All right , let us accept that the many betrayals of liberal ideals are only contingently related to such institutions and practices as an uncensored press , free universities , an independent judiciary , multiparty elections , and so on . And let us assume , furthermore , that these institutions and practices are effective instruments for ameliorating suffering . Let us have them , then ? but let us have them within the context of working-class state power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalists in the rich North Atlantic democracies , this would appear to be a recommendation for a more democratic setup than exists under even the most liberal capitalist regimes . It also comports with a long-standing Marxist emphasis on democracy and republicanism as the most appropriate forms of political rule under the dictatorship of the proletariat . If indeed liberal institutions are not a priori incompatible with noncapitalist alternatives , then it is natural to ask why such institutions could not be combined with , say , working-class state power or armed defiance of U.S. domination . In a paper published in 1987 , Rorty came as close as he has ever come to posing this question : " There is one question I wish Marxists would discuss more than they do : Why can we not yet point with pride to a noncapitalist democracy ? " " Without pausing for a response from Guatemalans , Chileans , or Nicaraguans , he immediately adds , apparently with a straight face , Is the only answer that you can not , in the present situation , be a Marxist government without becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let its clients encourage a free press , free universities , and so on ? Does this entirely explain the absence of such institutions in , for example , Cuba ? " Escalating U.S. aggression against the Republic of Cuba in the postSoviet era suggests a rather different answer to these questions : U.S. // leaders and their agencies have resorted to sponsorship of massive terrorism , unilateral acts of war , and economic blackmail ? frequently in violation of international law and numerous agreements of which the U.S. is itself a signatory ? to destabilize dozens of countries and impoverish their people , precisely in order to foment political instability , thereby obstructing the development of " a free press , free universities , and so on . " Sometimes this aim has been surprisingly explicit . For example , Edward Korry , the Kennedy-liberal U.S. ambassador to Chile during the Unidad Popular years ( 1970-1973 ) , stated that the U.S. would " do all within our power to condemn Chile and the Chileans to utmost deprivation and poverty , a policy designed for a long time to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chile . " 67 For three decades ? until pliant leaders in Moscow bowed to Washington 's demands that Russia abrogate mutually beneficial trade agreements with Cuba ? Washington has viewed socialism in Cuba not as a failure but as an alarmingly workable example to others . When it has come to health care , nutrition , infant mortality , literacy , worker self-management , and other important components of social welfare , Cuba has demonstrated its clear superiority over the so-called democratic regimes Uncle Sam and the graduates of the School of the Americas have foisted onto people elsewhere in Latin America and the Caribbean . Indeed , in a number of important respects , such as infant mortality and public healthcare , Cuba has ranked higher than the United States itself . Moreover , as Uncle Sam 's eventually successful campaign of enforced impoverishment of the island reminds us , Cuba 's thirty-year record of achievement was won in the face of vicious and unrelenting foreign aggression . Rorty has written that , " Only if one refuses to divide the public from the private realm will one dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' or dream of total revolution . " ' ' The foregoing discussion , by contrast , should at the very least have indicated that one can indeed imagine going beyond social democracy , while also retaining many of the liberal institutions that Rorty is concerned with preserving . Having said this , however , it should be acknowledged that the struggle to achieve and build workers ' power might well involve sweeping or convulsive social change , including perhaps the overthrow of one or another reigning liberal regime , or the dismantlement OI // some of the existing liberal institutions which , according to Rorty , are supremely precious . Of course , this goal , if achieved , is bound to fall short of what Bernard Yack has dubbed " total revolution , " or " a world without social sources of dissatisfaction . " 69 This , however , would hardly have bothered Marx or Engels . The founders of Marxism , after all , were at least as thoroughly critical of utopianism in the perjorative sense of the word as is Yack . In chapter 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest purposes of two paradigmatic figures , the strong poet and the decent citizen . These figures personify two liberal ideals : leaving people 's private lives alone and minimizing suffering , respectively . Rorty believes there should be no aims higher than these . In chapter 3 , I suggested that Rorty seriously underestimates the role social institutions , including political institutions , play in defining the private sphere and private selfhood . Taking this into account , the rich North Atlantic democracies do not appear to exemplify Rorty 's ideal of leaving people 's private lives alone . In the present chapter , I have suggested that Rorty likewise has failed to take full measure of the extent to which his favorite liberal democracies project power beyond their cartographic borders . Once we do so , however , it becomes clear that he has not provided convincing evidence that liberal institutions are the best means at hand for ameliorating the suffering liberal regimes continue to cause . In view of these considerations , actually existing liberalism could hardly be said to exemplify Rorty 's ideal of public decency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be warranted in concluding from this that " a free press , free universities , and so on " are incompatible with a vision of the future in which minorities of exploiters no longer wield state power . Indeed , a vision of these institutions within the context of workers ' power might well satisfy Rorty 's pragmatic requirement for an alternative vision that more closely approximates his public ideal than eithet the status quo or his liberal utopia. // As the title of one of Rorty 's better-known papers would indicate , he advocates placing politics before philosophical considerations . Before bringing this discussion to a close , then , it would be wise to take a look at his public and private vocabularies from the perspective of his explicit political commitments . CHAPTER FIVE OF LIGHT MINDS AND HEAVY HANDS e W have already noted that existing liberal institutions and prac tices are incompatible in important or systematic wavy with Rorty 's two highest liberal ideals . In the balance of this discussion , we k i l l contrast his public role as an apologist for actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should become clear that R n t v the ironist is similarly at cross-purposes with Rorty the apologist . A CIRCLE WITHOUT CIRCUMFERENCE Increasingly , Rorty has written as though pragmatism is not and should not be merely " an anti-representationalist account of experience and ail anti-essentialist account of nature , " but also , as Dewey has put it , " a poject for a social-democratic utopia . " ' In a footnote , he avers that // Dewey would have endorsed Unger 's slogan , " everything is politics . " Unger 's slogan , he says , follows from Dewey 's admonition that we " start with our social hopes and work down from there to theories about standard philosophical topics . " " Working down from there " does not involve the futile exercise of trying to provide philosophical justifications or foundations for one 's social hopes . Rather , as Rorty indicates in " The Priority of Democracy to Philosophy , " among other places , it involves redescribing things , past , present , and future , in terms that will make one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . This being the case , says Rorty , " it would be well for us to debate political topics explicitly , rather than using Aesopian philosophical language . " ' With reference to the suggestion that he ought to have some theoretical justification for the claim that freedom and equality are " the West 's most important legacy , " for instance , Rorty has written : I do not have any philosophical backup for this claim , and do not feel the need of any . The claim is little more than a hunch that the way in which the recent West differs most interestingly from other cultures that have existed is in the utopian social aspirations which it has developed . ' Theory is useful for public purposes when it comes to thinking through these utopian visions . Accordingly , " the philosopher of liberal democracy may wish to develop a theory of the human self that cornports with the institutions he or she admires . " ' Rorty stresses , however , that " such a philosopher is not thereby justifying these institutions by reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is putting politics first and tailoring a philosophy to suit . In keeping with this view , he acknowledges promoting a particular account of selfhood , namely the Davidsonian-Freud account glossed in chapter 1 , primarily because it suits the political purposes of " us social democrats . " ' As the reader will recall from chapter 1 , Rorty refers to this sort of tailoring operation as philosophical articulation of a political vision . Liberal democracy does not require philosophical justification or backup , though it does stand to gain from philosophical articulation . In // this context , " apologetics " ? a word we have already encountered above , and to which we will return in the final section ? could be used interchangeably with " articulation . " Both words have been put to paradigmatically ideological use , as I defined this word in the final section of chapter 3 . At times , Rorty has identified himself as a " leftist intellectual " addressing what he supposes to be a left-wing audience . This is apparent , for example , when he has recommended Roberto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of leftist university students to adopt Vaclav Havel as a hero , or lamented the overtheoretical obsessions of left-wing Americans , or collegially chastised " the Cultural Left " for worrying so much about such topics as the Meaning of Modernity that it has failed to help get liberal Democrats elected to office ( as if this goal were uncontroversially acceptable to " leftists " ! ) . ' Although he expresses impatience with what , following Harold Bloom , he dubs " the School of Resentment , " he betrays a somewhat bemused sympathy for " the Cultural Left " and a more sober sympathy for some feminists . ' Perhaps in part because of the last two considerations , some commentators have claimed that his occasionally alleged cultural conservatism is not backed up by political conservatism . ' Key terms in Rorty 's cultural conservatism that would be easy to confuse with political conservatism are elitism , aestheticism , ethnocentrism , and Eurocentrism . Indeed , he has made it so easy for " third-rate critics " to conflate his own cultural use of these words with prevalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , he is inviting them to score quick but illusory points . There is , of course , no hard-and-fast factual connection between the two conservatisms : Lots of political " radicals " have been cultural conservatives , and at least as many cultural radicals have been political conservatives . As Rorty 's social and political views have become more explicit , however , his 1987 statement that " fortunately " he has received " as much flak from the right as from the left has become increasingly doubtful . Witness not only the generally hostile reception he has received from his fellow social democrats , " ' but also the increasing sympathv with which he is ieNe ( l kw such neoconservative luminaries as Dines ) I ) ' Soui.a.
