<p> It 's one of the key stories of early modern painting : Paul Gauguin , a stockbroker , throws away his lovely wife , his well-paid job , his five young kids , and gives up all for art . At 35 , he sets off for the farthest shores of decadence and beauty . He befriends Vincent van Gogh . He sails for Tahiti , sinks into a paradise of perfumed hues and nut-brown maids , and dies in the South Seas , broke as well as broken  --  but not before extending , and altering forever , the history of art . <p> " Gauguin and the School of Pont-Aven , " the less-than-great but telling show opening today at the Walters Art Gallery , casts a raking light on that " Moon and Sixpence " legend . The Gauguin encountered here is less a loner than we used to think , and less a color painter , and more a kind of gang chief leading painters whose names we scarcely know . <p> When the exhibition opens , Gauguin is at the depth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now his poverty is fierce . He 's just shown 19 pictures in the eighth and last Impressionist Exhibition , but hardly anyone has noticed . He has n't found his style yet  --  he still paints like Pissarro . <p> When Gauguin departs from Paris in June 1886 , he has not yet become the man of the myth , the daring solo voyager heading for the hinterlands . Rather , like a banjo picker on his way to Nashville , or a TV actor L.A.-bound , he 's going where the action is . He 's off to Pont-Aven . <p> " The School of Pont-Aven "  --  when that phrase is heard these days , Gauguin looms so large , his flat colors burn so brightly , that his many colleagues somehow vanish in the glare . This show is a corrective . It reminds us that long before Gauguin arrived , that little town in Brittany already was a center of up-to-date French art . <p> Pont-Aven ( population 1,500 ) was far away from Paris , but the river village in far-western France was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , they had been going there in droves for a generation . It is easy to see why . Brittany was cheap and beautiful  --  and strange . <p> Sea mists wrapped the standing stones that stood beside the dunes . The language spoken there was not Parisian French ; it more resembled Welsh . Breton Christianity , with its old folkloric rituals , seemed ancient and mysterious . The clothes were different too . The men in their black hats , the women in their starched white coifs , wore native Breton dress of high-contrast picturesqueness . Artists of all sorts , French as well as foreign , left the inns each morning with easels on their backs , seeking the exotic . <p> But then significant French painters had been seeking the exotic for the past 50 years . French artists of Napoleon 's day had filled their works with pyramids and sphinxes , eerie images of Egypt . Ingres had evoked the languors of the Turkish baths , Manet had painted bullfights , Delacroix had marveled at the scimitars and flowing robes of the horsemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Pre-Raphaelites of England  --  admired costumed exotica just as much as the bohemian avant-gardists . The hunger for the " primitive " that one feels so clearly in Picasso 's borrowings from sub-Saharan Africa , and Matisse 's from Morocco , had been a staple of French painting long before the South Seas journeys of Gauguin . <p> When he first came to Pont-Aven , painting out of doors still was much in vogue , but Barbizon School landscapes had begun to look old-fashioned , and impressionist objectivity had begun to seem , well , tired . The pendulum was swinging . One could sense a wave of newness , invention and rejection , moving through French painting , and Gauguin was prepared to ride the edge of that change . <p> He discovered it in Pont-Aven . But he did n't ride it solo . Instead he was the leader  --  and sometimes a student  --  of a complex , shifting band . That group dynamic is the central subject of this layered 21-artist show . <p> Young progressive painters , then as now , were eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train stations and cafes , the look of modern life , so Gauguin and his pals would stress imagination . Instead of broken brushwork and strokes of myriad colors , they 'd lay down their colors in flat , uninflected planes . Seurat and the other pointillists of Paris sought semi-scientific methods . The youngsters would instead go for the romantic . The impressionists had caught the flicker of the instant . Gauguin and his friends  --  Emile Bernard , Charles Filiger , Jacob Meyer de Haan and Jan Verkade among them  --  would instead place the timeless , the ineffably mysterious , at the center of their art . <p> Modernism 's internationalism was prefigured by that band of romantic color painters . Mogens Ballin , whose rich and loving parents encouraged him toward painting , was a Jewish boy from Denmark . Cuno Amiet was Swiss . Jan Verkade was Dutch , as was de Haan . Wladyslaw Slewinski was Polish , and blue-blooded as well . Jens Willumsen was Danish , Roderic O'Conor Irish , Robert Bevan English . These painters , who together circled in on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' inns of Pont-Aven . <p> Bohemians often orbit some older , fiercer leader , attractive , charismatic , self-confident and stern , who tends to be regarded by others in the group ( almost always wrongly ) as a genius of some sort . Gauguin , who was older than the others , tougher , more experienced , played that role in Pont-Aven . <p> He pontificated . He instructed . When he taught Paul Se'rusier how to hint at landscape forms and liberate pure colors , he did so with such verve that the near-abstraction resulting from the lesson  --  it was painted on a cigar box lid  --  was known thereafter as " The Talisman . " It so awed Se'rusier , and the friends to whom he showed it , that some would claim it changed the whole tenor of their art . Maurice Denis was one of them . Though he never met Gauguin , he knew " The Talisman " by heart , and understood its teachings , which he eventually conveyed to Vuillard and Bonnard . <p> Defiant Paul Gauguin was not just older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also more courageous . And more outrageous . He let it be known that he was a duelist who if crossed could kill . He 'd fight sailors on the quay . When returning to his Breton haunts after trips to the Pacific , he 'd bring wonders with him  --  a painting of a ghost , or a monkey on a string , or that pliant teenage beauty known to gaping Bretons as Annah the Javanese . <p> The painters he inspired accepted certain rules : Paris slickness should be shunned . Colors should be untethered from appearances  --  so that a sea of blue might be shown as yellow , or a meadow of deep green might be painted blood-red . Crudeness was no crime . Indigenous and tribal images and cultures  --  Breton or Egyptian , Peruvian , Polynesian  --  should be granted respect . Pictures were expected to strike in the viewer 's soul a deep religious chime . Colors , outlined clearly , should be put down on the canvas one block at a time . <p> " There was a bevy of schools " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One , called the Stripists , painted in stripes with vivid colour as nearly prismatic as possible , all the scenery around . Then , there were the Dottists , who painted in a series of dots . There were also the Spottists  --  a sect of the Dottists , whose differentiation was too subtle to be understood . " Despite the twinkle in her prose , she was speaking of a truth : What later would become abstract color painting was to a large degree born in Pont-Aven . <p> Many painters until then had treated the canvas as a window , a kind of deep-space stage surrounded by a frame . Now flatness became acceptable . Maurice Denis , in 1890 , boiled down the teachings of the school of Pont-Aven : " It is well to remember that a picture  --  before being a battle horse , a nude woman , or some anecdote  --  is essentially a plain surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order . " <p> That instruction has been stamped on modern art . To make the point explicit , scholar Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Vuillard , Matisse , Milton Avery and Mark Rothko . By stretching only slightly , he might have added Lichtenstein and Warhol , Washington color painting , the austere grids of Mondrian , even supermarket logos . <p> The technologies of Pont-Aven  --  the acknowledgments of flatness , the cut-out blocks of color with dark lines between them  --  have been given much attention , but more needs to be paid to the religiosity of this art . The young painters around Gauguin were n't visual engineers . Many of the best of them held spiritual convictions ; they were seeking in the Breton mists not some chic new style , but truths . <p> It is 300 miles from Paris west to Pont-Aven  --  and the first two times that Bernard made the journey he did n't ride , he walked . Ballin was so moved by peasant pieties that he abandoned Judaism , took the name Francesco and became a Roman Catholic . Verkade became a monk . Gauguin was a pilgrim too . One feels him searching in his paintings for his own savage god . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pont-Aven , who could not hold the faith , spiraled into ruin . Jacob de Haan , a hunchback , impregnated his innkeeper and disappeared . Emile Jourdan became a drunk . Ernest de Chamaillard died in penury . Charles Filiger killed himself . Yet in the 1880s they all were filled with hope . Risk-taking , committed , they had everything that artists need  --  except , perhaps , great talent . When looking at their pictures one believes in their belief more than one admires their accomplishments . <p> This is not a show of masterworks . Almost all the paintings come from one collector , Samuel Josefowitz , who likes to term himself , coyly , anonymous . In spite of focused buying that 's consumed much time and cash , Josefowitz has assembled mostly pictures of the second tier . There are more than 100 in the Baltimore exhibit . They 'll travel to Montreal , Memphis and San Diego after " Gauguin and the School of Pont-Aven " closes at the Walters on Jan. 15 . <p> Admission is by reserved-time ticket only . Tickets  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on weekdays and $ 7 on
