<p> Journalists , the cliche runs , write the first draft of history . If that is indeed the case , future generations will look to reports about the Whitewater affair and scratch their heads . <p> To most Americans today , the story is as twisted as the roiling White River for which the Clintons ' failed investment is named , in part because the coverage itself has been so confusing . <p> But the reporting has revealed , perhaps more than any other current event , many of the difficulties inherent in journalism 's " search for truth " : remaining impartial , sorting through documentation , determining the trustworthiness of sources , and framing the story in a coherent and fair manner . <p> Those difficulties are heightened in Whitewater because of high-stakes partisanship and complex financial dealings . Add to that a sharpened appetite for scandal , and gleaning " the truth " may be impossible . Still , the coverage raises questions about the current state of journalism . <p> The latest entry into the debate is Gene Lyons , a columnist for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fools for Scandal " ( Franklin Square Press ) , Mr. Lyons charges that some of the nation 's most prominent reporters engaged in " journalistic malpractice " in a single-minded pursuit of scandal . He claims they omitted or ignored exculpatory facts , put others in misleading contexts , and fed a partisan fury determined to keep the controversy alive . <p> Lyons attacks with the same zeal that New York Times columnist William Safire displays when he goes after public officials whose veracity he doubts . The result has been indignation in the media and a counterattack on Lyons 's credibility . <p> The columnist acknowledges making some mistakes , but stands firmly by his overall analysis of the coverage . He is also somewhat dismayed by press reaction . " It 's the worst case of ' They can dish it out , but ca n't take it , ' I 've ever seen , " he says . <p> Whitewater , as most people know by now , is the name of a failed real estate investment the Clintons made with Jim and Susan McDougal in 1978 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press in 1992 , it has developed along two radically different lines . In each , many of the " facts " are not disputed , but people 's motivation and the context surrounding events are hotly debated . <p> In one version , the Clintons appear to be selfish , manipulative , and short on ethics . In the other , the president and his wife are the victims of a fraudulent land deal and a national press so bent on scandal , it looked past the truth . <p> Lyons , very clearly , falls into the " Clintons as victims " camp . From his perspective , they were cheated by their flamboyant and unstable partner Jim McDougal , who , when in need of money , sold the Clintons ' Whitewater investment , apparently without their knowledge , for pennies on the dollar . Mr. McDougal then turned around and told his version of the story to Jeff Gerth of The New York Times . <p> Setting the stage <p> Mr. Gerth is one of the country 's leading investigative reporters . He met McDougal when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs of the little-known governor who had suddenly appeared on the national scene . <p> His story set the stage for future Whitewater coverage , and Gerth continues to stand by it . He notes that the " two seminal questions " it raised - that the Clintons were business partners with the owner of a failed S &L; regulated by the state , and that Hillary Clinton did work for the company - have never been disputed . <p> " The piece did not say there were quid quo pros , that this was illegal , or bribery , " says Gerth . " The questions were framed as an association piece ... how people comport themselves . " <p> He is adamant the facts in his story stand up to scrutiny . <p> But Lyons contends that the context in which many of those facts are written is often misleading , and information that was available to Gerth , which would have cast a less sinister pall on events , was omitted or ignored . <p> As an example , he points to this sentence from the original 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's savings institution , Madison Guaranty , was insolvent , meaning it faced possible closure by the state , Clinton appointed a new state securities commissioner , who had been a lawyer in a firm that represented the savings and loan . " <p> Lyons contends the sentence clearly implies that Clinton appointed the commissioner , Beverly Bassett Shaffer , for the " purpose of protecting McDougal . " That implication , he says , is incorrect and Gerth knew it . <p> Before the article was written , Ms. Bassett Shaffer had provided Gerth with a lengthy memo that documented the steps she and federal regulators had taken to reform the S &L; - which at the time had not yet been declared insolvent . They included ousting McDougal from Madison for " self-dealing and insider abuse . " <p> " Jeff Gerth had that information available to him . The question is , why did n't he use it ? " asks Lyons , noting that McDougal , Gerth 's acknowledged source for much of the original story , was convicted on bank fraud charges earlier this year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Bassett Shaffer , who was never accused of any wrongdoing and has been supported by federal regulators , Gerth 's defense of the " facts " without recognition of the context , is a " narrow and shaky defense . " <p> She says the innuendo in his articles , and those of other reporters who followed his lead , ruined her reputation . <p> " I just think it 's incumbent on journalists to be more careful , " says Bassett Shaffer . " It just takes that one time , and a life spent building a reputation for integrity is gone . And there 's nowhere to go to get it back . " <p> Others have also criticized what Richard Parker calls the " Joe Friday - just the facts , ma'am , " style of contemporary investigative reporting . Mr. Parker , a senior fellow at the Shorenstein Center for Press , Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University , notes that that is very different from the muckraking investigative journalism of the turn of the century , when reporters like Upton Sinclair were driven by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being neutral and objective . <p> " Facts need to be read in the light of motivation , " Parker says . " It frustrates people when they 're given data without context . It would be as if a neutral Virgil led Dante through the Inferno without explaining why people were there . " <p> Bassett Shaffer also criticizes the press for what she calls a " carelessness ... a tendency to just repeat what has already been in print " without checking its veracity . <p> Lyons maintains the reporting on Whitewater is full of such instances . In a March 18 , 1994 article , Gerth wrote that the State of Arkansas had given Tyson Foods a $ 9-million loan after a Tyson lawyer , who was also a friend of Mrs. Clinton 's , helped her make almost $ 100,000 trading commodities . The loan never existed . Gerth says he misread a chart on deadline and greatly regrets the error . It was corrected a month later . <p> Meanwhile , many in the national press had written columns and editorials questioning Mrs. Clinton 's integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lawyer , Robert Bennett , came upon another example in James Stewart 's book " Blood Sport " ( Simon and Schuster ) . In the story about last-minute negotiations to avoid a sexual harassment suit brought by Paula Jones , Mr. Stewart states as fact that Clinton " got to the point where he agreed to read a statement that apologized but did n't concede Jones 's version of events . " <p> Mr. Bennett claims that never happened and is dismayed that Stewart did n't call him to check the contention . " I told him , it leads me to question other things in the book as well , " Bennett says . <p> Stewart , who is a Pulitzer Prize-winning former editor at The Wall Street Journal , says he based his statement on published reports about the failed settlement talks . <p> A Nexus search found two stories . One in The Washington Post quotes only Ms. Jones 's lawyer saying the proposed settlement language had Clinton " conceding he may have met the woman " and that he " regretted untrue assertions " about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other article , in The New York Times , does quote Bennett stating very clearly : " I was not prepared to have the President apologize for something he did not do . " <p> Scrutiny is ' healthy ' <p> Mistakes are not uncommon in journalism , and Stewart clearly did extensive research for his book . And while he is offended by many of Lyons 's criticisms , Stewart also believes the scrutiny around the Whitewater coverage is " a healthy thing . " <p> New York University 's Edwin Diamond says the " truth " about Whitewater does lie somewhere within all of the conflicting reports and interpretations . The challenge is to sort through them all and find it . " Was Jeff Gerth had ? Was Lyons sloppy ? There 's right and wrong mixed up in all of it , " he says . <p> Lyons and others contend that it is incumbent on the press to be more cautious and responsible . As for the historians , they 'll have their work cut out for them . <p> WILFREDO LEE/AP
