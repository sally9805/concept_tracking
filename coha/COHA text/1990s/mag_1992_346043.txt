You have money in the bank earning 3.5% , and it 's killing you . <P> It 's not even that the interest rate is so low , it 's that it 's so . . . embarrassing ! You feel  --  well , let 's face it  --  you feel a little like an idiot . After all , 3.5% is n't even 3% after taxes . And with inflation running at whatever it 's running at , say 4% , you 're actually losing money ! <P> Of course , it was no better a decade ago , in 1982 , when banks were paying 12% but tax rates and inflation were higher . You could have been losing money back then too , but at least 12% seemed like a lot . And with the Dow groveling around 800 , what was your alternative ? Certainly not stocks  --  everybody knew stocks were no place for smart money . <P> Now , 10 years later , with the stock market nicely recovered  --  quadrupled , actually  --  it 's safe , finally , to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market or buy bonds . <P> Or that 's what everyone seems to be doing , anyway , and who am I to quarrel with multibillion-dollar monthly capital flows ? <P> Yet quarrel I do . When friends call to ask which mutual fund to plunge into , I make the following speech : " It 's great that you 're thinking about stocks , " I say , " because , over the long run , stocks will outperform safer investments . And it 's great that you 've decided to go the mutual-fund route , because that 's almost always wiser than picking the stocks yourself . ( Do yourself a favor , though , " I remind them , " and choose a fund with low annual expenses and no sales fee . ) But are you sure now is the time to jump in ? Now , when stocks are more expensive than they have ever been in the history of the world ? " ( I allow myself a certain cosmic license here , for effect . ) " Is n't the concept to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high ? " <P> They get my drift , they thank me , they take one more look at that 3.5% , and they call their brokers to buy mutual funds . <P> And they could be right ! Just because something 's overpriced does n't mean it wo n't become more overpriced . Look what happened in Japan . But as often as not , things ultimately right themselves . ( Look what 's happening in Japan . ) <P>  --  If you already have money in the market , either through a long-standing program of periodic investments in mutual funds or through your retirement plan at work , bully for you . Keep it up . The habit is such a good one , I would n't recommend breaking it , even though the market is overpriced . ( If you 're anywhere near needing some of those funds , though , lighten up . ) <P>  --  If you do n't have a long-term periodic-investment program and want to start one with a small nibble now , that 's fine too . It 's more important that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Otherwise , steer clear . My guess is that a lot of people , fleeing a safe 4% return , will find ways to lose 40% . ( In the ' 70s it was n't low interest rates but high tax rates that drove sensible people to do silly things . Desperate to avoid forking over 70% in taxes , they lost 100% in limited-partnership tax- shelter deals instead. )
