BURL , B. GORDON , AND I HAD SAT DOWN in B. Gordon 's living room for a moment , just to take a load off , and before we knew it we were hashing through the O.K. City bombing again . Though , being good Christians , we were aggrieved over the thought of anybody injured or dead or covered with debris or in any sort of discomfort whatever , we all had independently come to the opinion that the bombing was a wake-up call to liberal government to get in line with the will of the people . The end was drawing near . You could tell from the way the globe of the world in Levi 's living room was pincushioned and bristly with signs of the times  --  wars and rumors of wars , famine and flood , all manner of disaster . You get a few beers in you , then you look at that porcupined globe and it sobers you just to think of all that God-driven death , so you reach for another can . <p> We had had a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soulmobile . He calls it the Soulmobile because it is an old bus with Jesus ' face on the side and he employs it to herd people up on Sunday and convey them relentlessly to church . It is also his solitary means of transport , and often he can be found grousing to God , begging him to stretch forth his hand and give him a vehicle with style to drive around town during the week . <p> He is going to WalMart , he tells us , and he 's trying to park , but the Soulmobile is too big for a single place or even two places , and the whole parking lot is stopped up . There is no place to park the Soulmobile that 's not going to leave it jutting across lanes , so he thinks it over and ends up parking out on Virginia . While he 's there , damned if he does n't get a ticket . <p> " It 's like ticketing Jesus , " says B. Gordon . " Whether you do it to Him or to the righteous vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask you : who would have the nerve to fine the Lord God of Hosts ? " <p> " I thought all the police in this town were Christian , " says Burl . <p> " I thought so too , " says B. Gordon . " I 'd been led to believe just that . " <p> " So you 're saying we got an atheist squirreled away among the police ? " I ask . <p> " Could be , " says B. Gordon . " Could be . But let 's not forget , " he says . " Where 'd the problem start ? Who tempted the police ? " <p> " Well , " I say . " Far as I can see , you tempted the police through your style of parking . " <p> B. Gordon shakes his head . " You know that ai n't it , Leon , " he says . " That 's just the superficial view . Me , I 'm but the intermediary . The problem is WalMart . " <p> This draws Burl and me back some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : everybody knows they 're controlled by the government , which in turn is just a puppet of the New World Order , so that even if most police are Christian they 're caught up in a non-Christian conspiracy of apocalyptic proportions . But WalMart is a different story . You do n't talk lightly or poorly when it 's a question of WalMart . WalMart is one of the two biggest things that happened to this town , the O.K.C. bombing being the other , and pretty much everybody is convinced WalMart is first on the list . <p> " Hey , " Burl says . " Lay off , B. " <p> " Now do n't misdefine me , " says B. Gordon . " I have nothing against the store . " <p> " That ai n't what it sounds like , " says Burl . <p> B. Gordon puts on his stern hellfire look . " Burl , we 're all brothers , are n't we ? Are n't we ? " <p> Burl starts scuffing his feet . When B. Gordon starts talking like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are n't we ? " B. Gordon says again . When Burl still does n't answer , he looks up at me . " Hell with it . We 're all brothers , " he says absently . " Brothers in Christ Jesus . Do you judge your brother ? " He looks to Burl . " I ask , do ye judge him ? " <p> " Should n't , " says Burl . <p> " Damn right , " says B. Gordon . " Now let me finish before you start blurting and spouting . " He reaches from where he 's sunk into a secondhand but still perfectly good couch and takes hold of his beer , takes a few sips while we all wait . <p> " You go to Amish country , " he says . " Not that anybody in their right mind would , but theoretical now . All the WalMarts in Amish country , they got wagon parking . " <p> " Naw , " says Burl . <p> " I shit you not , " says B. Gordon . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started asking questions . B. Gordon , ' says I , this is n't Amish Country , it 's God 's country . So should n't there be parking for God ? ' " <p> When he states it that way , by comparison and all , it makes sense . That 's the strength of old B. He manages to look at things and discern the logic that everybody else loses track of . When it 's told us that way , we ca n't help but see the sense in it . But in this case , sense alone does n't quite span the gap . <p> " But it 's WalMart , B. , " says Burl . <p> " They even got a McDonald 's inside , " I say . <p> " It 's not just any ordinary WalMart , " says Burl . " It 's a Supra-WalMart . Open 24/7 . They got a grocery store and a video rental and a hair salon and even a bank  --  not just a cash machine but a whole fuck-all bank . They got a tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deer , and there 's an electronics center and a shitload of toads and frilly hats and God knows what else . " <p> " You could live there , " I say . I am thinking Toads ? <p> " They got everything but a goddamn church , " says Burl . <p> " Well , why not ? " asks B. Gordon . <p> Burl , drawn up , looks at B. Gordon . " What ? " asks Burl . <p> " Why do n't they have a church ? They got every damn thing else . " B. Gordon reaches out , pulls both of us in close . " Brothers , I ask you , " he asks us . " Has WalMart been saved ? " <p> That 's how it gets started . B. Gordon does n't say he 's going to be the one to bring the Lord to WalMart , but he does n't have to say it  --  we know him too well . We know we got to keep half an eye on him , waiting to see when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Monday Burl and I fill the truck with tree clippers and look for work for a few hours and even batter on a few doors . Nothing 's doing . As Burl says , this town is treed out , and all we can hope for is to live a few months on welfare and wait for attitudes concerning the trimming of foliage to change . If it gets bad enough , I can fire Burl and he can fire me , and then the both of us are legal again for unemployment , more or less . <p> By noon we are back to B. Gordon 's , drinking beer . The next day , Tuesday , we reach B. Gordon 's at 11:38 by Burl 's watch , on Wednesday at eleven sharp . The rest of the week we do n't even pretend to drive around . We just save ourselves a little gas and head straight to B. Gordon 's at nine and set about drinking before B. is even out of the shower . It makes for a tough week , all that serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break and sleeping in , so Burl and I do n't go to B. Gordon 's but instead spend half the night discussing the problems of a federal-government domination . By Sunday morning we are nigh unto dropping and throw ourselves face-first into bed . <p> Or at least I do . I ca n't speak for Burl after he stumbles out my door . What I can speak for , though , is how it seems like I 've only had my eyes closed about two goddamn seconds when there 's a sound going off and I think it 's my alarm and I keep trying to grope around on the dresser and turn it off while my face is still pressed into the pillow . It takes me a few to realize it 's not the alarm at all , but a horn . <p> I stumble up and open the door . Light hits me right in the hangover , and I feel sick . Damn if it is n't the Soulmobile , Jesus ' cracked and peeling face smiling on the outside . <p> " Bout time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sluggard . " <p> Burl is already aboard , scruffed up and blinking , looking like something the cat coughed up . I groan . " Hop in , " B. Gordon says . " Start praising Jesus . " <p> On the way to the church we stop at WalMart . The lot is mostly empty , and B. Gordon parks where he damn well pleases . He tells us to wait . He rushes in , and Burl and I do what we can to get back into sleep . I am nearly there when the Soulmobile door springs and B. Gordon is in , red-faced and disturbed . He is talking about the Whore of Babylon and her splendid finery . <p> " I did n't ask them for their days , " he says . " I only asked them for God 's day . " <p> " What 's up , B. ? " asks Burl . <p> But he just starts the Soulmobile and lurches through the parking lot , whispering under his breath , Hellfire , hellfire . <p> At the church we handpick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of holy . We sit in the back , the far left corner pew , where B. Gordon does n't have a clear view of us . That way we can sleep . Which is what we do , me leaning against the wall and Burl leaning against my shoulder . When we wake , the sermon is up and running , not sputtering either but in full swing , with B. Gordon getting a slap-rhythm going on the pulpit with his palms and driving it in with his Jesuses and Hellfires . We half-watch , even though we have seen it countless times before , Praise God , and know where it is all leading : straight to the collection plate . He waits until he has the crowd at its height , then passes the plate while the blood 's still tingling . It 's a proven fact that 's the best way to get people to turn out their pockets to Jesus . <p> Sure enough , it 's Hellfire , hellfire , then the plate going about a jiggle with money , but it is different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , B. Gordon keeps talking instead of sitting at the piano and letting the closing hymn strike up . He is saying how money is good but what Jesus needs of each of us right now is one of those fishing vests with all the pockets . What the hell ? I am wondering . Burl , being a catfish trawler of no common repute , stiffens beside me , and I can see him drop his head so B. Gordon wo n't catch his eye . <p> Jared Barnes , who works at Jock 's Nitch Sporting Goods , and who gets a 30 percent discount , is n't so lucky . Suddenly B. Gordon begins to recount a parable about adultery , in the abstract at first but then in more detail , and Jared properly senses that it is becoming an anecdote that will in the end concern him and Myla Phipps . So when B. Gordon takes a pause and licks his lips and asks again who wants to donate Jesus Christ a fishing vest , Jared Barnes figures his marriage is worth 70 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoots his hand up . Jesus usually gets what he wants . <p> In the same way , B. Gordon angles some free photocopying , some posterboard , two card tables , and ( probably this one is for himself , not Jesus ) one case of premade hamburger patties . When he finally strikes up the closing hymn , everybody breathes again . They are afraid of coming to church , but more afraid of staying away . <p> On Monday I make the mistake of actually getting a job . I 'm not quite sure how it happens . I go in just as lackadaisical as always , knowing they will not hire me , but they do , and the only interview question they ask is " Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior ? " When I say yes , I 'm given the job . <p> Worse still , it 's a government job . It involves coming to a different city park every day and picking up litter and throwing it away . At each park I 'm supposed to turn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then shut them off . Somebody who gets paid more will cut the grass . If there are hoodlums , I am supposed to tell them to behave or I will call the police . <p> The job keeps me busy . It 's not that any part of it is difficult , but it just adds up . I last eight days , which for me is none too bad . The problem is that on the second day , in Couch Park , I turn on the water and then forget to turn it off . It stays on all week , until on Saturday the Little League fields are pretty thoroughly flooded and about a hundred uptight parents leave complaints on the office answering machine . To top it , on Thursday I come into Tower Park and there , sitting on a picnic table , are a group of what I judge to be hoodlums . I go up to them and tell them to behave or I 'll call the police . They respond , " Huh ? " This is about as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell " huh " means in their private language , probably some new jive form of disrespect , so I make an executive decision and start kicking their asses . Pretty soon the park is hoodlum-free . When my boss calls me in on Monday about the flooding , he also tells me that nobody under the age of twelve can be defined as a hoodlum , and that I should never take it upon myself to kick someone 's ass while on the state clock . Then he tells me I 'm fired . <p> Which is fine by me . It gives me more time for the important stuff . Besides , a man 's got to be a fool to work for the government these days , with the end of the world coming on . <p> I drive down to B. Gordon 's and find the door locked , though a sign tacked above the door reading Jesus Always at Home is still posted . I knock ; no answer . I go around to the back door and pull the handle , but it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow a beer . <p> I hop into the truck and spend some time cruising the town . I go up 6th and then Main and then Hall of Fame . I go by Burl 's , but he is n't in either . <p> I 'm halfway down Perkins , driving slow and careful , just passing the WalMart , when I look over and see the Soulmobile . It is parked not in the lot but smack on Virginia , which reduces Virginia to about three-quarters of a lane . One line of traffic is going straight , edging against the ditch , while the other has to take a detour through the WalMart lot . <p> When I walk into the store , the first thing I see , right next to the carts , is B. Gordon . He 's sitting at a card table , wearing the fishing jacket ( now embroidered Fishing for Souls over the pocket ) , pamphlets spread before him . A sign in violet marker reads First Jesus Church . There is a coffee can , Give unto the Lord scrawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he sees me , and nods . <p> " B. , " I say , and do the same . Then I say , I do n't know why , " I went by the house . " <p> " I was n't there . " <p> " No , you was n't , " I say . " That 's why I came here . " <p> " You come to the right place , " he says . <p> " I can see that , " I say . <p> We rest awhile , me with my hands in my pockets and both of us looking poker-faced . <p> " What you doing ? " I finally say . <p> " What does it look like I 'm doing ? " <p> " Sitting there . " <p> " That 's half of it , " he says . " The other half is bringing religion to WalMart . " <p> " They let you do it ? " <p> " Not a question of let , " he says . He gestures with his chin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know if he 's telling me to check on Burl or not , but since I do n't have anything else to say , I walk down . I find Burl playing with the coin-return slot of the pay telephone , a folded card table next to him . <p> " Burl , " I say . <p> He looks at me nervously , thrusts his hands into his pockets . " Leon , " he says . <p> " I thought you were supposed to set up shop , " I said . <p> " They shut me down . " <p> " That did n't stop B. Gordon . " <p> " B. Gordon 's an ass . " <p> We stand there for a minute , and then Burl picks up the table , tucks it under his arm . We walk back to where B. Gordon is  --  or I should say was , because by the time we get there he is being dragged off by blue-vested WalMart employees . He is not going easy , is cursing WalMart and the federal government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have heard before , except that before WalMart was n't implicated . He curses them as they carry him and his card table all the way across the parking lot , keeps cursing even after they drop him in the gutter . <p> We wait until the guards are gone and then saunter over . <p> " So they kicked you out , " says B. Gordon to Burl . <p> " Something like that , " says Burl . <p> " They 're godless , " says B. Gordon . " Do n't they see the signs of the times ? The country 's going to the dogs , and WalMart 's leading the pack . The conflagration 's coming unless we can nudge them back on the religious track . " <p> Burl rests the table against his thigh , scratches under his arm . " But they kicked you out , " he says . <p> B. Gordon looks at Burl , disgusted . " So ? Did Jesus give up when they kicked him out ? " <p> " Kicked him out of what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no WalMarts back then , " says Burl . <p> " That 's right , " says B. Gordon , pointing at Burl . " All they had was dust and scrub and other misery , and they had to scoop a living out of it , and here we are with all the advantages in life . If Jesus could do it then , we can do it now . " <p> " What did Jesus do ? " I ask . <p> " Shut up , " says B. Gordon . " Get faithful . Get on your knees and pray for WalMart to open its heart and let Jesus rush in . " <p> Five minutes later the card tables are stowed in the Soulmobile , which has a ticket on the windshield . B. Gordon tears it up and scatters the pieces , and then we have linked arms , B. Gordon in the middle , and are marching back to WalMart . " We shall overcome , " B. Gordon is singing softly through the lot , but as we reach the doors he stops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipping in incognito . <p> B. Gordon goes straight ahead , walking the long aisle along the edge of the grocery department , back toward the rows of milk coolers and the McDonald 's . I pass the registers , then curve slightly to the right , through the men 's clothing and then , with eyes averted , women 's clothing , and then , accidentally , the women 's underwear , which I swear I do not even look at . I hurry on through to the watches . <p> When I look over my shoulder , I see Burl right behind . He is shadowing me . I try to shake him by going up and down through the baby clothes , but he does not shake . <p> " Burl , " I hiss . <p> He is grimacing at a pack of diapers , pretending not to hear me . <p> " Burl , " I say , loud . <p> He puts one finger over his lips . <p> " Quit following me , " I say . <p> He looks puzzled , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and raise my fist as if to violence him . <p> He lurches away , looking back once at the end of the aisle . <p> I walk through the books section , then spend some time regarding teapots . They only have two styles , shiny and not-so-shiny , so it does not take up much time . I wander through sporting goods , running my hand along the dimpled , curved skins of a row of basketballs , then through the pinking shears and to the large aisle , back toward McDonald 's . <p> When I get there , I find B. Gordon set up at a table , the pamphlets out of his fishing jacket and all over his table and the one next to it . There are two WalMarters in blue vests standing nearby with their arms crossed . <p> " They 're going to shut you down , " I say . <p> " They do n't have no authority here , " he says . " This is McDonald 's , not WalMart . " <p> " But it 's a McDonald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " It 's like the Vatican being in Italy but being its own country . Not that I 'd ever compare something in this fine state to the evils of papacy . " <p> I do not know for certain what papacy is , but I know better than to ask . It does not matter anyway , because as soon as B. Gordon starts setting up his signs , the blue vests are on him . <p> " I 'm going to have to ask you to leave , " one says . <p> " You ca n't ask me to leave , " B. Gordon says . " I 'm pleading the sanctuary of McDonald 's . " <p> " Do you want me to call the police ? " <p> B. Gordon just keeps arguing , trying to show them the light . He is still trying when the police drag him away . <p> I go to unemployment and get bawled out by Ralph Jenks , of all people , for keeping my job only a week . Eight days , I correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps acting like he is going to refuse me benefits , keeps shaking the form in my face , which makes me remind him yet again that the federal government has rendered us all foolish in more ways than one , and him most of all . That makes him wave the papers around a while more , but in the end he signs . <p> Later I go to the park and loiter around in the manager 's office until they write out a check just to get rid of me . I take my eight-day check to Checks Cashed and Pawn down on 6th , then divide the cash into four pants pockets and squirrel some into the bottom of each boot . I am short of comestibles like eggs and sausage and beer , so I go over to WalMart and get a cart and start pushing it through the grocery aisle . Somehow I end up filling the cart with chewing tobacco and crap like maraschino cherries , and I know I 've got to cut it out or else by the time I get to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars and cents from my boots . So I go around putting things back . <p> I am looking through cartons of eggs , trying to find ones without cracks , when I hear someone behind me saying under his breath Jesus-Jesus Jesus like he is selling drugs . While it 's a proven fact you can get high on . Jesus , Jesus is definitely not a drug . When I turn , I see that it 's B. Gordon . He 's wearing the fishing jacket , the pockets stuffed with pamphlets , a button pinned to the front reading Jesus Is Lord , only Lord is misspelled Lored . <p> " Got them now , " he says . <p> " What ? " I say . " Who ? " <p> " I 'm a mobile church , " he says . " God always wins in the end . " <p> " You have n't won yet , " I say , and gesture . Behind him , at a little distance , pretending not to watch him , are two employees in blue vests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He undoes the top two buttons of the vest , pulls it quickly open to reveal pale red cylinders duct-taped around his chest like giant firecrackers . <p> " That is n't what I think it is , " I say . <p> " Sign of the times , " he says . " The conflagration 's coming . " <p> He keeps moving , two blue-vests trailing him . I head straightaway to the checkout and then abandon my cart there and step outside . Leaning against the cart return , I wait for the explosion . History is in the making . I know it will be the biggest thing this town has ever seen . For months , nobody will talk about anything else . All over the country , people will be pushing more pins in their globes and maps , drinking more beer , shivering with the realization that B. Gordon has pushed us one step closer to the final end . <p> <p> By Brian Evenson <p>                  @ @ @
