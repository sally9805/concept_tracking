Section : MONEY UPDATE News about your money <p> If you need a short-term loan , do n't get stuck paying 16.4% for an unsecured personal loan from a bank or 21% on a typical credit card 's cash advance . Instead , if you 're one of the 35.6 million people with Sears ' Discover credit card , you can use a new , little-known technique and borrow up to your credit limit for 50 days at an annual rate below 2% . ( The typical initial credit limit is about $2 , ( 100 , but you can apply for a higher one by calling 1-800-DISCOVE . ) And you can repeat the procedure six times a year , 12 times if you or your spouse gets another Discover card . <p> I 've borrowed on the cheap this way since hearing about the Discover program that began in February . It lets cardholders get cash advances up to their credit limit without owing interest if they pay back the money within a 25-day grace period . Discover has no annual fee in 48 states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks to obtain advances . To avoid owing Discover 's normal 19.8% finance charge , you must pay your purchase-balance in full the month before the cash advance appears on your statement and the month after . Otherwise , the interest you will owe could easily exceed a year 's worth of your anticipated low borrowing costs . <p> The only catch is a transaction fee equal to 2.5% of the cash advance , with a minimum charge of $2 and a maximum of $10 . This fee makes cash advances of a few hundred dollars or less prohibitively expensive . For example , a $200 advance paid off in 25 days would have a $5 fee  --  a 36% annual interest rate . But you can turn this wooden nickel into a golden opportunity by increasing the size of the advance and the number of days that you keep the money . Here 's how a recent cash advance worked for me : <p> JULY 24 : It 's the closing date for my July statement , and I write a $4,000 cash advance check to my money-market fund . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hundred dollars in purchases and no cash advance . I pay off the balance before the grace period ends on Aug. 18 . <p> AUG. 30 : My August statement arrives , showing the cash advance . I owe $4,010  --  the advance plus the $10 fee . <p> SEPT 10 : I write a $4,010 check from my money-market mutual fund , which clears three days before the end of the grace period for Discover 's August billing cycle . <p> The result : The annualized interest rate on this 50-day , $4,000 loan was 1.83% . On a $5,000 advance , the rate would have been only 1.46% . Can this great deal last ? It looks like it . Says Beth Metzler , the card 's public relations manager : " Discover definitely plans to keep this feature forever , as far as I know . It 's not just a limited-time offer . " Hope she 's right . CONSUMER COMFORT POLL TABLE Gloom reigns <p> The MONEY/ABC Consumer Comfort index dropped to - 28 , its lowest level ever , soon after Iraq invaded Kuwait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back a bit to - 24 after our poll respondents had become slightly more confident about their personal finances . But Americans are now skittish about spending money . Some 71% of those polled said now was not a good time to buy the things that they want and need .  --  Jordan E. Goodman <p> THIS JUST IN <p> While U.S. Savings Bonds are widely available at banks , some bankers and customers are starting to complain about new rules required to sell them . In 19 states and Washington , D.C. , you must now wait up to three weeks after paying for the bonds before receiving them in the mail . By 1993 , nearly all banks will have to go along . First Pennsylvania Bank has already stopped offering savings bonds . The news is significant because Washington has tried to beef up EE savings bonds as a way to finance college . <p> By Michael E.
