<p> There were days in the past when the Oilers ' secondary should have been the recipient of a roast-and-toast banquet . Under former coach Jerry Glanville , cornerbacks were sacrificial lambs about to be slaughtered while the other members of the defense were kamikaze pilots blitzing their way to the quarterback . <p> Then came defensive coordinator Jim Eddy 's schemes , in which man-to-man coverage was as rare as a cool Houston day in August . <p> The secondary usually stuck to the basics of a two-deep zone , which worked well most of the time . Aside from the Buffalo debacle , the defense did n't give up a lot of big plays , but it also did n't make a lot of big plays . <p> Most people view Buddy Ryan 's " " 46 " defense as being something closer in philosophy to Glanville 's system than Eddy 's . <p> " " This defense is totally different than when Jerry was here because we had no help then , " cornerback Cris Dishman said . " " This defense is aggressive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's fundamentally sound . " <p> In Ryan 's system , defensive backs are sometimes expected to line up and cover some of the NFL 's fastest players while the guys up front are blitzing to try to make hamburger meat out of the quarterback . <p> If things do n't go right in certain situations , a defensive back can look bad in a hurry as a fleet-footed receiver races past for an easy touchdown  --  a sight all too reminiscent of the Glanville days . <p> But the Oilers ' defensive backs believe those comparisons are unfounded . <p> " " I do n't believe we 're going to get beat as much as everybody seems to think , " strong safety Bubba McDowell said . <p> " " This has only come up because of what happened at the end of the New Orleans game ( last Saturday ) . But those were backups , and that 's not going to happen with our starters . " <p> The Saints completed a 57-yard touchdown pass when they caught the Oilers blitzing . Quarterback Mike Buck found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle in man-to-man coverage with cornerback Emanuel Martin . Once Dowdell was past Martin , it was clear sailing to the end zone . <p> For some Oilers fans , that one play brought back ugly thoughts of plays under Glanville when Houston defenders consistently got burned deep while Glanville was blitzing seven or eight players . <p> " " Under Jerry , it was bump-and-run all the time , " Dishman said . " " It was like , " You 've got this guy , and everyone else blitz . ' <p> " " But now , we cover up for each other . We usually have free-safety help over the top , and sometimes we have linebacker help underneath . " <p> Ryan does n't deny his defensive backs will sometimes have to go one-on-one , but he also says there are few similarities between Glanville 's blitz-happy philosophy and the 46 defense . <p> " " It 's not even close , " Ryan said . " " We run 20 different coverages , and a lot of those are doubles where the corners are getting all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's true in any defense . <p> " " It 's much different than what they do in Atlanta ( under Glanville ) . When I was doing the CNN show , I would say Atlanta had a hell of a chance to win a lot of games if they would play defense where they were n't always giving things away . " <p> Backup free safety Bo Orlando believes Ryan 's defense is the perfect balance between Eddy 's conservative approach and Glanville 's all-out gambling tactics . <p> " " With Jerry 's system , there never was any help for the corners , " Orlando said . " " In Buddy 's system , it 's half and half . <p> Sometimes you do , and sometimes you do n't . It becomes a guessing game for the quarterback as opposed to playing against Jerry , where the quarterbacks knew to throw deep routes up top . Here , it 's much more difficult to read whether it 's one-on-one or whether someone is rolling over to help out . " <p> The Oilers ' defensive backs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten deep in the 46 , but they also believe the positives far outweigh the negatives . <p> " " You 're not going to play man-to-man with blitzes and not get beat a few times in a year , " Orlando said . " " But you 're also going to create mistakes by the offense . What we want to do is cause more big plays for us on the other end . We want to cause three or four turnovers a game . It 's a give-and-take situation . " <p> And it 's a situation Orlando says all of the defensive backs prefer over Eddy 's system . <p> " " We 've wanted this more attack-type system , " Orlando said . <p> " " There 's too much talent in the league to expect to sit back and stop people all the time . You have to put pressure on these NFL quarterbacks because any time you give a guy like Dan Marino or John Elway time , I do n't care what kind of coverage you have on them , they 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not a coincidence that Orlando would mention Elway , who two years ago engineered an incredible drive from the Broncos ' two-yard line that propelled Denver to a playoff victory over the Oilers . <p> Had the Oilers been playing the 46 that day , maybe things would have turned out differently . The same can be said about Buffalo last January or any of the games under Glanville that were lost on defensive mistakes . No one knows for sure if Ryan 's defense would have made a difference . <p> " " That 's true , " McDowell said . " " But there 's another thing involved , and that 's how much pressure you put on the quarterback . <p> In the past under Jerry , we did n't have the guys up front on the defensive line we have now . <p> " " When Buddy was at Philadelphia , their defensive backs were good , but I do n't think they were better than what we have here . <p> The key was that great pass rush they got . They forced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The Eagles ' secondary was considered one of the best in football when Ryan was the head coach , but Ryan said Houston 's secondary is " " the most talented I 've ever had . " However , the 46 requires more than talent ; it relies on the corners to make good decisions in critical situations . <p> " " We did n't get hurt on blitzing ( against New Orleans ) except for one time at the end , " Ryan said . " " The rest were mental errors that would have happened whether we were blitzing or not . We had two mental errors by Dishman and two by ( Darryll ) Lewis . " <p> Dishman is a veteran who is n't likely to make those kinds of mistakes in the regular season , but Lewis is a third-year player who is starting for the first time . Mental mistakes in man-to-man coverage can become six points on the other end . <p> " " That 's what people keep saying , " Dishman said . " " But Darryll and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as everyone thinks we are . Believe me , this defense will work . " So the Oilers ' defensive backs are n't worried . They firmly believe they are going to look good a lot more than they are going to look bad . <p> " " Buddy has taken this defense to the Super Bowl , " Orlando said , referring to Ryan 's tenure as defensive coordinator for the 1985 Chicago Bears . " " He knows what it takes . "
