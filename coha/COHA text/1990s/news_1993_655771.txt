<p> RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin and his United States counterpart , Bill Clinton , meet this weekend in Vancouver , British Columbia . Foremost on the agenda will be ways the US can help Russia keep the transition to democracy and a market economy on track . In the run-up to the summit , the Monitor asked Russians from various professions and regions , as well as longtime Western residents here , for suggestions on what Clinton could offer Yeltsin in Vancouver . Here 's what they said : Sergei Plotnikov , economics professor <p> First of all , President Clinton must decide whether he wants to help Russia or Yeltsin . It is not one and the same thing . If he wants to help Russia , he should make efforts on providing guarantees for American investors . We certainly will survive without American investments , but then the process of economic development will take much longer . <p> If President Clinton wants to help personally President Yeltsin , he should make some urgent infusions like a food credit . Alexander Malchik , Russian- American entrepreneur in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't to give money to Russian businesses or anyone Russian . It should give it in the US - to US businesses in order to develop business in Russia - including loan guarantees , low-interest loans , and government insurance . <p> Large US companies have already come here , but medium and small companies ca n't afford the risks . Yet , only small businesses can move quickly here . Imagine if 20,000 individual companies set up businesses here . What it would do for the Russian infrastructure ! What it would do for the American economy ! And it would be a power involved in Russia from the start . Involvement of medium and small businesses here in large numbers will help establish confidence and strengthen the government . Peter Derby , president , Dialog Bank , Moscow , US-Russian joint venture <p> I think that if the US is going to do anything , it should translate the entire US fundamental law into Russian , everything from the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to commercial codes . Let the Russians use the foundation documents as something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that , to explain the foundation bricks a country is built on . To a great extent here , you have to start from scratch . Somebody needs to assist in answering questions , such as what does the vice president do . Konstantin Mezentsev , Russian Association of Farmers and Agricultural Cooperatives <p> We private farmers are at the starting period of our development . We are setting up real agricultural cooperatives , based on private ownership and formed by the free decision of farmers . We need to establish a network of agricultural cooperative banks . Our farming is developing quickly , but we have no money to establish capital . We desperately seek equipment for food processing because our farmers want to develop cooperatives to process and market our food . <p> We also need concrete assistance in educating our farmers . We are trying to establish our own network of agricultural extension services , as you have in the United States . Your services are run by the government . But here in Russia we are the only organization which is trying to set up this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example video equipment to show educational films to our farmers . Aleksei Osipov , newspaper editor , Karelian Republic <p> Clinton should organize a meeting to get all our leaders together , not only the Russian president , but leaders of the parliament and others . The sides here are so far apart that there is no way they can find agreement on their own . <p> Such a meeting should be held on so-called neutral territory , perhaps in Washington . If he Clinton tries to help only Boris Yeltsin it will cause big problems with the Russian parliament . Clinton must try to involve everyone ... It could be something like what former US President Carter did at Camp David to help bring peace to the Middle East . <p> Another thing Clinton can do is help Yeltsin form a proper presidential apparatus , by providing advice on how the president 's team can function smoothly . Yeltsin has made a lot of mistakes because his team is so disorganized and his aides are giving bad advice . Charles Blitzer , chief economist , World Bank Moscow office <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide scholarships for large numbers of Russian students , at graduate and undergraduate levels , to get MBAs , degrees in economics , and so on . The benefits that other countries are getting from American training are significant . These include countries such as China , India , and Mexico . There should be 10,000 scholarships available a year for Russia and the other former Soviet republics . Andrei Richter , journalism professor <p> One way the West can help is to give supplies to non-state television stations - something that would help create diversity in the distribution of information . Good equipment and transmitters are needed . Helping to create an independent , nationwide television channel would be important . If such a channel existed it would then be hard for the state to reestablish control over the mass media . Konstantin Borovoi , founder of the Russian Commodity and Raw Materials Exchange and leader of the Economic Freedom Party <p> There should be no aid free of charge , no charity ... I 'd like to see not charity but commercial participation , using commercial banks , commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it paves the way for communism 's comeback . Americans should consult with private entrepreneurs , not with state officials , otherwise they strengthen the command-administrative system which still exists . Mikhail Berger , Izvestia correspondent <p> Clinton should stop considering Russia a communist country . In trade relations with the US , Russia is still figuring as a communist country . First of all , I mean a number of legal acts like the Jackson-Vanik amendment a US law that links most-favored-nation trade status to the emigration of Russian Jews and others . All of these measures were passed during the cold war . <p> Rescinding these laws is a minimal , simple , concrete , and cheap thing that Mr. Clinton could do . Ilya Konstantinov , co-chair of the hard-line National Salvation Front <p> Russia needs a huge amount of financial aid , but I feel Clinton wo n't be able to provide enough . First of all we need aid to help reduce the painful effects of economic reform . We need a line of credit . Right now America is interested in providing aid for disarmament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . What we need is aid for the purchase of food and consumer goods . Viktor Bezotosny , history professor <p> Today , the humanities are in dire straits . It 's become almost impossible to do research and publish the results of scholarly work . The state ca n't help , it just lacks money . <p> So I think the US can provide financial aid to help establish independent cultural foundations administered by boards of prominent public figures and scholars , which will be able to support humanities that , under present conditions , are simply withering away . <p> And secondly , these foundations can help our libraries get foreign language scholarly publications to which they can not subscribe now because of the lack of hard currency resources . Alexander Bazayev , regional Chelyabinsk official <p> Talk about humanitarian aid gives us heartburn . If America really wants to help , it should give not humanitarian aid , which for many people is humiliating , but it should promote investment in concrete programs , concrete business plans with the obligations of both the donor and recipient properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in military conversion or agriculture but specifically - to Chelyabinsk Oblast region , for introducing Dutch technology for producing potatoes , by giving a five-year loan at a such-and-such interest rate . There should be a clear responsibility for all credits . Otherwise money just seeps into the sand . <p> And one more thing : Mr. President , do n't create idols ! The experience with Gorbachev should be enough of a warning for the West . Yevgeni Svyatsky , artist <p> I believe that the larger part of financial aid allocated for Russia should be spent on organization of trips to the States for as many Russian people as possible , and at that , not so much for Muscovites , but for the people from the provinces . Judging by my own experience of traveling to the US I must say that in contrast to Europe , where life is overloaded with historical and traditional phenomena , the American way of life clearly demonstrates superiority of the democratic and market-economy system .
