Chaco Canyon , New Mexico DAMNED RATTLERS . Ashley Carter knocked trail dirt from her boots before climbing into her rusted Chevy pickup . She threw her dusty cowboy hat on the seat next to her and swiped a handkerchief across her brow . Leaning over the gear shift , she popped the glove compartment and removed the snakebite kit . With a knuckle , she tapped the radio . Static rasped from the handheld receiver . Humming , she peeled back the wrapper from the syringe and drew the usual amount of venom antiserum . By now she could gauge it by sight . She shook the bottle . Almost empty . It was time to run into Albuquerque for more . After cleaning her skin with an alcohol swab , she jabbed the needle into her arm and winced as she administered the amber fluid . Loosening her tourniquet a notch , she wiped iodine over the two punctures in her forearm , then applied a bandage . Cinching her tourniquet a bit tighter , she glanced at the dashboard clock . Ten minutes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio handpiece and pressed the button on its side . " Randy , come in . Over . " Static as she released the button . " Randy , please pick up . Over . " Her neighbor , Randy , was still on disability from a back injury at the mine . For the past ten weeks , he had earned a few extra bucks under the table by supplying day care for her son Jason . She started the engine and pulled back onto the parallel ruts that constituted a road . The radio belched agarbled blast of noise , then she heard , " ... up . Ashley , what 's going on ? We expected you back an hour ago . " She raised the handpiece . " Sorry , Randy . Found a new room in the Anasazi dig . Hidden by a rockfall . Had to check it out before the light went bad . But a diamondback had other ideas . I 've got to check in with Doc Marshall now . Be back in about an hour . Could you pop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receiver back on the radio . A squelch of static . " A bite ! Again ! This is the fourth time since Christmas . You 're pressing your luck , Ash . This solo venturing is going to get you killed someday . But listen , after you get checked up by Doc Marshall , hurry home . There 's some Marine types here waiting for you . " She furrowed her brow . Now what did she do ? She groaned and grabbed the handpiece again . " What 's up ? Over . " " D'know . They 're playing dumb , " he said , then added in a lower voice , " and they 're damned good at it . Real G.I. Joes . You 'd hate ' em . " " Just what I need . How 's Jason handling it ? Over . " " He 's fine . Eating it up . Talking the ear off of some corporal . I think he almost got the jarhead to give him his gun . " She smacked the steering wheel with the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing guns into my home ? Damn , I 'll be there straightaway . Hold the fort ! I 'm out . " She never carried a gun . Not even into the badlands of New Mexico . Damned if she was going to allow some overgrown boys to bring weapons into her home . She slammed the truck in gear , her wheels clawing at loose rock . * * * Ashley jumped from the truck , arm tucked in a blue sling , and crossed through her cacti garden , hurrying toward a group of uniformed men huddled under the small green awning over her porch , which offered the only shade for a hundred yards . As she stomped up the wooden steps , the men in front backed up . Except for one man , who sported bronze clusters on each shoulder and stood his ground . She strode right up to him . " Who the hell do you think you are , barging in here with enough arsenal to blow away a small Vietnamese village ? I have a boy in there . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned back to remove his sunglasses , revealing a cold blue stare , void of any emotion . " Major Michaelson , ma'am . We are escorting Dr. Blakely . " She glared at him . " I do n't know any Dr. Blakely . " " He knows of you , ma'am . He says you 're one of the best paleoanthropologists in the country . Or so I 've heard him tell the President . " " The president of what ? " He stared at her blankly . " The President of the United States . " A sandy-haired juggernaut plowing through the uniformed men covered her surprise . " Mom ! You 're home ! You got ta come see . " Her son eyed her sling , then grabbed the sleeve of her other arm . " C'm on . " Even though he stood only a little higher than their belt buckles , he ushered the military men aside . Glaring , she allowed herself to be dragged through the door . As the screen door clapped shut behind her , she headed toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . It was n't hers . The scent of garlic from a baking lasagna wafted toward her from the kitchen . Her stomach responded with a growl . She had n't eaten since breakfast . Randy , armed with stained oven mittens , was attempting to extract the bubbling lasagna without spilling it . The sight of such a bear of a man , dressed in an apron , struggling with a pan of lasagna , brought a smile to her lips . He rolled his eyes at her . As she opened her mouth to say hello , there was a sudden urgent tugging at her arm . " C'm on , Mom , see what Dr. Blakely has . It 's bitchin ' . " " Watch your tongue , mister , " she warned . " You know we do n't allow that sort of language here . Now show me what this is all about . " She waved at Randy as she was tugged toward the family room . Her son pointed to the briefcase and whispered , " It 's in there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her attention . The door opened and a tall black man , thin as a pole and dressed in a three-piece suit , entered the hallway . He was older , his close-cropped hair graying slightly . He pushed a pair of wire-rim spectacles farther up the bridge of his nose . Spotting Ashley , he broke out in a sudden smile of recognition . He stepped toward her quickly , hand proffered . " Professor Ashley Carter . Your picture in last year 's Archaeology magazine failed to do you justice . " She knew a snow job when she heard one . Caked with trail dirt , arm in a sling , clad in mud-stained jeans , she was no beauty queen . " Can the crap , Doc . What are you doing here ? " He dropped his hand . His eyes widened a moment , and then he smiled even broader . He had more teeth than a shark . " I like your no-nonsense attitude , " he said . " It 's refreshing . I have a proposal to " " Not interested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your entourage can hit the trail now . Thanks anyway . " " If you 'll only lis " " Do n't make me toss your butt outta here . " She snapped her arm toward the screen door . " It pays a hundred grand for two months ' work . " " Just get your " Her arm dropped to her side . Clearing her throat , she stared at Dr. Blakely , then raised an eyebrow . " Now I 'm listening . " Since her divorce , she had been struggling to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads . An assistant professor 's salary barely covered their living expenses , let alone her research projects . " Wait , " she started . " Wait a minute . Is it legal ? It ca n't be legal . " " I assure you , Dr. Carter , this offer is legit . And that 's only the beginning , " Dr. Blakely continued . " Exclusive authorship of research garnered . Guaranteed tenure at the university of your choice . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How can that be possible ? There are university statutes ... rules ... seniority ... How ? " " This is a project advocated by the highest people . I have been given free rein to hire whomever I want at whatever salary I desire . " He sat down on the sofa and crossed his legs , arms spread the length of the sofa . " And I want you . " " Why ? " Ashley questioned tentatively , still suspicious . Leaning forward , he held up a hand , begging patience . He reached for his briefcase and clicked it open . Using both hands , he carefully lifted a crystal statuette from its interior . He turned it upright toward her . It was a human figurejudging from the pendulous breasts and gravid belly , a female figure . The fading light caught the crystalline structure and reflected radiant bursts . He nodded for her to take it . " What do you think ? " She hesitated , afraid to touch its fragile beauty . " Definitely primitive ... Appears to be a type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously . " Right , right ... Here , look closer . " He raised the heavy statue , arms shaking with the strain . " Please examine it . She reached to take the statuette . " It 's sculpted out of a single diamond , " he said . " Flawless . " Now she understood the armed escort . She withdrew her hands from such a priceless object as she pondered the implications . " Bitchin ' , " she whispered . * * * Across the kitchen table , Ashley Carter watched as Dr. Blakely flipped the cellular phone closed and returned it to his breast pocket . " Now , Professor Carter , where were we ? " " Is anything the matter ? " Ashley asked , sopping up tomato sauce from her plate with a piece of garlic toast . The two of them sat at her green metal kitchen table . The doctor shook his head . " Not at all . Just confirming the addition of one of your potential teammates . An Australian caving expert . " He smiled reassuringly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him warily . " Who else will be joining the expedition ? " " I 'm afraid those names are confidential . But I can tell you we 're talking to a leading biologist in Canada and a geologist from Egypt . And a few ... others . " Ashley could tell this line of questioning was futile . " Fine . Back to the diamond statue , then . You never told me where the artifact was discovered . " He pursed his lips . " That information is also confidential . Only for those involved with the research . " He folded the gingham napkin on his lap . " Doctor , I thought this was going to be a discussion . You 're rather lean on your answers . " " Perhaps . But you still have n't given me a concrete answer yet either . Are you willing to join my research team ? " " I need more details . And more time to reorganize my work schedule . " " We 'd take care of such minor concerns . " She thought of Jason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the television . " I have my son . I ca n't just up and leave . And he 's no minor concern . " " You have an ex-husband . A Scott Vandercleve , I believe . " " Jason 's not staying with him . Forget it . " Blakely sighed loudly . " Then we do have a problem . " This point was going to be a stickler . Jason had been having trouble at school , and this summer Ashley had vowed to spend some time with him . " This is not up for debate , " she said with as much conviction as she could muster . " Jason accompanies me , or I have no choice but to decline . " Blakely studied her silently . She continued , " He 's been on other digs with me . I know he can handle this . " " I do n't think that would be prudent . " He smiled wanly . " He 's a tough and resourceful kid . " Blakely grimaced . " If I agree to this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused , removing his glasses and rubbing at the indentations on the bridge of his nose . He seemed to be thinking aloud . " I suppose he could stay in Alpha Base . It 's secure . " Replacing his glasses , he reached across the table and held out an open palm . " Agreed . " Relieved , she let out her breath and shook his dry hand . " So why so much effort to get me on your team ? " " Your specialty . The anthropology of cliff-dwelling primitives . Your work on the Gila dwellings was brilliant . " " Still , why me ? There are other paleoanthropologists with similar interests . " " Several reasons . One " he began ticking off the points on his fingers " you 've demonstrated you can manage teams on other digs . Two , your nose for detail is superb . Three , your perseverance in solving mysteries is bone-hard obstinate . Four , you 're in excellent physical shape . Five , you 've earned my respect . Any other questions ? " Satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She fought back a blush . Rarely did one hear praise in her field . Uncomfortable , she changed the tack of the conversation . " Now that we 're partners , maybe you can tell me where you discovered this unique artifact . " She rose to clear the dishes . " Somewhere in Africa , I 'd guess . " He smiled . " No , in Antarctica , actually . " She glanced over her shoulder , trying to judge if he was testing her . " There are no primitive cultures on that continent . It 's a barren glacier . " Blakely shrugged . " Who said on it ? " She rattled a dish in the sink . " So where , then ? " She turned to him , leaned back against the sink , and dried her hands with a damp dish towel . He just pointed a single finger toward the floor . Down .
