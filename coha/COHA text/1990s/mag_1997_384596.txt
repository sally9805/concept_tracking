In search of singletrack heaven in the land of Deliverance . // Religious experiences are commonplace in the South . I myself have had several , usually while I 'm on my mountain bike tunneling dogspeed through green and goldenrod , thorny stems nipping at my forearms . Of course , communing with your god is not something you can plan or schedule ( church revivals excepted ) . The best you can do is set aside some time , open yourself up to divine intervention , and hope he/she makes the call . Or , you can ride Tsali , a series of impossibly skinny singletrack loops perched in the forests of North Carolina 's Smoky Mountains , a place where the spirit always moves and even the most stiff-necked skeptics emerge glossy-eyed believers . This is the real South , a place of Christ , collards and country . An area where you might meet snake handlers , good old boys , and women in Kyle Petty T-shirts . Unlike the gloss of Nashville or urban sprawl of nearby Atlanta , Tsali rests in the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mecca ( though there are plenty of antique shops to be found on the drive in ) , and no Starbucks . Instead there are A-frame cracker houses in the woods , modest clapboard Baptist churches , and the sporadic BBQ shack , leaning precariously on its cement-block props . The rest is green , thanks to Nantahala Gorge , a stretch of National Forest land that is famous for its hiking ( the Appalachian Trail runs straight through the Nantahala Outdoor Center ) and paddling ( the Olympic slalom canoe and kayak races were held on the nearby Ocoee ) . Whitewater rafting is bigger than Elvis here , and the NOC offers trips down four local rivers , including the Class IV and V Chatooga which kicked Burt Reynolds ' toupee in the movie Deliverance . Of course , if Burt were smarter , he would have had a mountain bike , been spared the sliced quadricep he suffered on the river , and been ripping up Tsali 's singletrack , arguably some of the best mountain biking in the world . About a three-hour drive from Atlanta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more than 40 miles of rolling singletrack that border Lake Fontana . Across the lake the Smokies roost , all blue mist and bosomy smooth-scoops of whipped cream amid the clouds . As you ride , you catch glimpses of the mountains through Nantahala 's ever-present breaths of fog , which spiral up geyserlike from dense snatches of trees and hover like woodland angels or benign haints . Wildflowers cluster trailside , shrieks of color surrounded by the brown of fallen leaves and wood . Moss covers the ground in a carpet of kiwi green . True , the trails are barely technical , a buffed version of Vermont with less mud . But they are , thanks to the undulating knolls and dales , fast . We 're talking Nintendo fast . Rapid-fire stimuli pelting your brain like hail on a carhood . Or , as my pal Lee put it , staccatostyle , after his first Tsali ride , Root , rock , tree , mud puddle Root , rock , tree , mud puddle ! Root , rock , tree , mud puddle We began on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laurel , sharp switchbacks and stream crossings . We climbed gradually , ebbing and flowing up the hill , sucking in the thick , damp air . We passed only a few other riders , and stopped often to soak in the view or clean crud from our derailleurs . We talked a lot about food , specifically fried chicken and biscuits and how best to make them . It was that type of ride , the kind that does n't require surgeon-like attention to the trail-only a modicum of respect . With just little , wheel-seizing detritus on the trail , your mind is free to think about everything , nothing and biscuits . We finished two hours later , eyes teary from the wind . Even though the rain had resumed , the parking lot was full . Rain is irrelevant at Tsali . As is Lycra . The predominant rider here is gung-ho country boy meets organic-green-eatin ' eco hippie . Denim and fleece are the ensembles of choice . I felt dorky in my jersey . More dorky than usual . Photograph TSALI : where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Photograph TSALI : where the singletrack is sweet and whitewater rafting is bigger than Elvis . Photograph // Not that anybody cared . Unlike in Boulder or Moab , looking the part matters little . Because Tsali is a multisport destination , the attitude meter stays low . Everyone mountain bikes , and canoes , and hikes . No one activity is deemed cooler than another . Even the local paddling legends such as former U.S. Canoe and Kayak Team member Wayne Dickert and ESPN Survival of the Fittest winner Julie Dauphine are low-key , hang-about folks . The energy is unalterably mellow , a product of a Southern pace and blindingly divine geography . On our visit , about half the plates in Tsali 's lot were from out of state . As we washed our bikes at the complimentary wash center , we met a Wrangler-wearing Texan , and a woman from Portland who prefers Tsali 's trails to anything in the Northwest . When we asked a couple of locals where to get good fried chicken , we ended up with more recommendations than we could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the booze . In our soggy , mud-caked way , we all felt cleansed , happy and hopefulbaptized by Tsali . Even my formerly dour bud from the Northeast was grinning . It was a goofy smile that stayed put for two days , one that smacked of fervor and evangelism , crazy looking , truth be told . But no one in the Nantahala woods found it the least bit peculiar .
