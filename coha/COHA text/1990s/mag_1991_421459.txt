Scientists battle an invasion of zebra mussels <p> Dreissena polymorpha must seem downright unneighborly to the residents of Monroe , Mich . In December 1989 , for instance , thousands of these little mollusks , commonly known as zebra mussels , clogged the sole intake pipe of the town 's water treatment plant , forcing a two-day shutdown of Monroe 's schools , industries and businesses . <p> In this and other cities on Lake Erie , water intake pipes provide ideal feeding grounds for the stripe-shelled bivalves , which sift microscopic nutrients from passing water . While the mussels may relish their easy access to this aquatic buffet , they are viewed as unwelcome trespassers by Great Lakes utilities and industries , which expect to spend up to $4 billion this decade to unclog mussel-infested intake pipes . <p> Zebra mussels also pose a threat to the food web of the Great Lakes and surrounding waters . Because zebra mussels reproduce rapidly  --  an adult female produces up to 50,000 eggs a year  --  and eat massive amounts of phytoplankton , they have the potential to overwhelm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which dine off the lower end of the food chain . <p> Scientists believe D. polymorpha , native to the Caspian Sea , arrived as a stowaway in the ballast water of a transatlantic freighter in 1985 or 1986 . Flushed into Lake St. Clair , which lies sandwiched between Lakes Erie and Huron , the immigrant mollusk has since spread into all five Great Lakes and other inland waters , including the Erie Canal and the New York State Barge Canal . And because they face few , if any , natural predators , the North American communities of these mussels have experienced explosive growth . <p> Tiny zebra mussel larvae can ride water currents for hundreds of miles . Adults , however , attach themselves with a powerful glue to any hard surface , including buoys , pipes and piers ( SN : 1/5/91 , p.8 ) . Because the bivalves can survive out of water for several days while attached barnacle-style to the hulls of boats , they already have been inadvertently portaged to many inland lakes and rivers . <p> These mussels also colonize the rocky bottoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If allowed to take over and despoil these species ' spawning grounds , the mollusks could jeopardize the walleye fishing industry ( valued at $900 million a year in Lake Erie alone ) and thwart efforts to reintroduce lake trout to the Great Lakes , just as the trout have begun to recover from massive predation by another Great Lakes invader , the sea lamprey . <p> Simple filters can not stop the near-microscopic zebra mussel larvae from entering water intake pipes , where they eventually anchor along interior surfaces . As a result , these homesteaders are infiltrating and fouling everything from the cooling systems of nuclear power plants to the engines of powerboats . Environmental engineers have begun fighting back with a range of toxic agents , including chlorine . But because chlorine combines with organic matter to form carcinogenic hydrocarbons , it can be safely used only in tightly contained spaces such as the interior pipes of power plants . Paying an underwater diver to scrape away the mussels  --  a costly time-consuming and dangerous task  --  constitutes the best available alternative . <p> However , killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; incoming water soon brings more larvae , and the control efforts must begin again . Moreover , toxic molluskicides can not be dispersed in open waters to keep D. polymorpha from overwhelming habitats of other aquatic species . So scientists are investigating safer control measures . <p> Fearing the mussels will spread throughout most of the United States and southern Canada , researchers have mobilized to control this small but destructive bivalve . Since biologists did n't discover D. polymorpha in the Great Lakes until the summer of 1988 , they are only beginning to plan their strategy to combat it . If the battle with the sea lamprey proves any guide , zebra-mussel researchers can expect full-time employment for many years to come . The eel-like , ocean-dwelling lamprey  --  which became a Great Lakes scourge after the 1959 opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway provided it entry  --  went uncontrolled until the 1970s . <p> " There wo n't be one answer to the zebra mussel problem , " says Daniel P. Molloy of the New York State Museum Biological Survey Field Research Laboratory in Cambridge . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Several scientists are focusing on manipulating the sex life of the marauding mussels . <p> For instance , Jeffrey L. Ram of Wayne State University in Detroit and David W. Garton , a zoologist at Ohio State University in Columbus , hope to capitalize on the fact that these bivalves spawn when they detect an explosive growth , or " bloom , " of phytoplankton . This timing ordinarily ensures sufficient food for the larvae that hatch several hours later . <p> But Ram and Garton want to trick the mussels into spawning at less opportune times , since the larvae are very vulnerable to starvation . <p> " Once you get the males to spawn , the presence of sperm in the water rapidly triggers the females to release eggs , " Garton points out . There are at least two ways to exploit this , notes Ram . If he and his colleagues can discover an agent that triggers premature release of sperm  --  and out-of-season spawning  --  they may be able to starve the larvae . Toward this end , Garton and Ram will test extracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Alternatively , if Ram can identify what constituents in the sperm initiate female egg release , he and his coworkers might develop a water treatment program that essentially puts the male and female spawning cycles out of sync with one another . <p> " At this point , " Garton says , " we really want to find something that 's very effective at manipulating the males to spawn . " <p> In experiments last year , Ram and Susan J. Nichols of the US . Fish and Wildlife Service in Ann Arbor , Mich. , discovered one such chemical serotonin . Male D. polymorpha released their sperm when injected with this natural neurotransmitter , present in everything from snails to humans . Though the discovery ensures researchers a good supply of mussel sperm for their laboratories , Ram and Nichols caution that this potent nervous-system messenger affects too many other animals to safely release it in the wild as a weapon against zebra mussels . The researchers are now planning to investigate whether chemicals extracted from sperm might provide more environmentally benign and species-specific agents for controlling mussel spawning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zebra mussel 's sex life : hunger . <p> To get the energy they need to produce sperm or eggs , mollusks feed voraciously just before spawning . By forcing zebra mussels to close their shells at the right time , Garton hopes to shut down the important feeding frenzy that fuels successful spawning . Right now , he is looking at the effects of spreading an irritant over a colony of zebra mussels . The challenge , he says , is finding a selective irritant that causes D. polymorpha to clam up but does not shut down its more benign bivalve neighbors . <p> Such sex-cycle manipulation might prove sufficient for controlling zebra mussels if the aquatic pests spawned just once a year , during a relatively brief period . However , Nichols says , with year-round access to ample food supplies , many of these mollusks do n't appear to wait for the typical midsummer phytoplankton bloom before they spawn , but instead may release small amounts of sperm and eggs throughout the summer . <p> Moreover , she notes , because the characteristics of zebra mussel colonies even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically assume that any one control method will work equally well for all colonies . " They do n't call these things polymorpha for nothing , " she says . <p> Nichols is particularly concerned about a zebra mussel colony she 's studying near Monroe in the Raisin River . These waters receive plentiful supplies of organic nutrients from the rainwater running off nearby farmlands . The fact that the Monroe mussels " get 750 million gallons of food-filled water an hour being shoved right by them " helps explain why they can carry ripe sperm and eggs all year and produce larvae anytime between May and October , she says . Indeed , she suggests , biologists may have no " window of vulnerability " to exploit for controlling zebra mussel colonies in this kind of environment . <p> A molluskan propensity for changing sex may also complicate the biologists ' task . <p> Whenever the environment strongly favors one sex over another , many mussels of the unfavored sex begin changing their gender , Nichols notes . Though she has never observed this phenomenon in zebra mussels , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be very fertile , Ram says , because a few males can produce enough sperm to fertilize most of the females ' eggs . And in the Monroe colony , females currently outnumber males five to one . <p> Nichols says biologists could doom such a colony to extinction if they could inhibit the community 's relatively small number of males from releasing their sperm . Ram hopes to explore whether inhibiting the serotonin-controlled male sexual response might accomplish this . <p> Though perhaps less intricate than interrupting the animals ' sex life , a strategy suggested by Susan W. Fisher may lead more quickly to mussel control . <p> Fisher , a toxicologist at Ohio State , is very good at killing zebra mussels . In her studies , she subjects them to all manner of poisons under a wide variety of conditions to determine , among other things , the minimum lethal dose of each toxicant . <p> To Fisher 's surprise , zebra mussels died when she put them in distilled water made to match the recipe of EPA standards for " pure " water . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution killed the mussels by destroying their gill tissue . Since the toxic substance came from water that EPA considers innocuous , Fisher immediately concluded that she had found the perfect molluskicide . <p> Further testing tempered her enthusiasm . She found she needed fairly high concentrations of potassium to kill large numbers of adult zebra mussels  --  and at such doses , the metal also began killing bivalve mollusks closely related to D. polymorpha . <p> However , potassium may still have a role , Fisher says , because it is a lot less harmful to species unrelated to mollusks than currently available mussel poisons . Her data also indicate potassium may prevent zebra mussels from attaching themselves to surfaces , thereby keeping the mollusks from clogging pipes and engines . The concentration needed to do so might be " substantially lower than the dose that kills them outright , " says Fisher , who plans to test that hypothesis this summer in Lake Erie . If her hunch is confirmed , low levels of potassium might be continuously released around pipes to prevent zebra mussels from colonizing them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in adding potassium phosphate into its marine paint to discourage the mussels from adhering to the hulls of boats , Fisher adds . If effective , this coating might prove a safer alternative to today 's copper- and tributyltin-based " anti-biofouling " paints , which poison other species . <p> At the New York State Museum , Molloy is searching for a natural microbe to control D. polymorpha . <p> The best way to find zebra mussels infested with a naturally occurring parasite , Molloy says , is " to go where the zebra mussels have spent centuries , if not millennia . That would be the Caspian Sea . " However , since he does n't expect that costly proposal to win funding , he is screening soil and water microorganisms native to North America , hoping to find one that produces a substance toxic to this pest . <p> Although the odds of discovering such a microorganism may seem daunting , Molloy points out that an earlier systematic screening of soil bacteria identified a microbe that kills black-fly larvae . The bacterium was a variety of Bacillus thuringiensis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages over currently used chemical molluskicides such as tributyltin and chlorine , according to Molloy . First , microbial secretions often prove toxic only to a few species , he says , so one that kills zebra mussels might largely ignore the mussels ' aquatic neighbors . The species-specificity of the bacterium active against black-fly larvae , for instance , " is extremely unusual for an insecticide , " Molloy notes . <p> Second , a naturally occurring North American microorganism might present less risk of environmental harm  --  an important concern in getting regulatory agencies to approve commercial use of such control methods . <p> Molloy recently began screening spore-forming bacteria , which generally produce toxins , hoping to find one toxic to zebra mussels . Both zebra mussels and black-fly larvae are aquatic filter-feeders , Molloy says , which makes him optimistic that if enough scientists join the search , they will eventually find a microbial toxin for D. polymorpha . " It 's a question of screening enough of them , " he asserts . <p> Though the zebra mussel 's invasion of the Great Lakes threatens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit . Because each of these voracious feeders can filter microscopic algae from up to 1 liter of lake water per day , the bivalves have dramatically cleared Lake Erie 's water . <p> " It 's hard to dismiss the fact that when you go up to Lake Erie now , you can see to the bottom , " says Fisher . " And that 's only come about in the last three or four years  --  which is precisely the time at which the mussels invaded .
