Tired of looking like a sausage ? Here are 15 loose-fitting shorts that look-and feel-good // If you 've ever stumbled into a redneck saloon to refill a water bottle , you know skintight , spandex cycling shorts have liabilities that sometimes outweigh their , um , assets . In the saddle , they 're unbeatable for comfort , aerodynamics , and breathability . Off the bike , though , they can make you feel like you 're from planet Dweeb , arriving aboard rocket ship XL . Sure , you could throw a pair of hiking or gym shorts over your sausage-skin cycling garb . That 's fine for a trip to the store . But on more ambitious rides , obtrusive seams tend to tenderize your tender parts . Unto the breeches come baggy cycling shorts-loose-fitting garments with a sewn-in inner short and chamois . They first appeared about 5 years ago , appealing mostly to young mountain bikers who wanted a hip look and a way to distinguish themselves from roadies . At first only a few small companies produced baggies . But the trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us whose body poundage exceeds our weekly mileage total . We found 27 companies with at least one model of baggies . Many make 2 or more . We evaluated more than 40 pair , selected the top 4 ( see " Best of the Test " on page 82 ) , plus 11 other good ones ( see chart ) . To make the cut , shorts had to have a thigh-length inner short rather than a brief , which puts seams in contact with your crotch . They also had to include at least some of the following features : a lightweight , soft outer short that 's comfortable and not too hot ; breathable inner short with leg grippers to keep it from riding up ; seamless crotch on the outer short for durability and comfort ; and a pocket you can close for INSPORT OFF ROAD 800/652-5200 CoolMax carrying keys , money , etc . And , of course , the shorts had to be comfortable for at least moderately long rides ( an hour or 2 ) . We also considered style , a completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' inherent fashion component . To be honest , even the best baggies we tested do n't match the cycling performance of a good pair of spandex shorts , though some come surprisingly close . Besides being hotter than traditional shorts , baggies can at times snag on the saddle , ride up on your thighs , bunch in your crotch , and flap on fast descents . Advantages include more crash protection and water resistance than spandex-qualities mountain bikers especially will appreciate . More important , baggies are much more flattering . If selfconsciousness is restricting your riding and these shorts help you feel better about your appearance , then they 're worth the fairly small compromise in performance . * BEST OF THE TEST 1 . InSport Off Road If there 's a pair of baggies we 'd wear on a long ride , this is is it . In Sport 's Off Road Shorts are comfortable , lightweight , and stylish . At $55 they 're a good value , too . The nylon/spandex inner short fits as well as a spandex short , the DuPont CoolMax chamois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the extra layer of the outer short . The cotton shell is durable but also soft and lightweight . We also like the zippered rear pocket , roomy front pockets , seamless crotch , and attractive belt with easy-to-adjust buckle . Another plus : The inner short is slightly longer than the shell , so the shell does n't rub your thigh as you pedal . The simple design and earth-tone colors remind us of a nice hiking or sports short . They even have men 's and women 's sizes , unlike most baggies , which are billed as unisex . Our only quibble : no gripper elastic on the inner shorts ' legs to keep them from riding up . 2 . Zoic Gusseted It 's virtually a toss-up as to which of our next 3 shorts is better . We 'll take the $56 Zoic , primarily because its brushed-cotton shell makes this one of the softest , best feeling shorts we tried . The shell also boasts a stretchy Spandura crotch panel that qualifies these shorts as among the least constricting . Thumbs up , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets , and CoolMax liner . Unfortunately , that comfy shell is a bit heavy , making these shorts less breath able than some with a thinner outer . 3 . Dark Continent Nylon Lycra Dark Continent has been making baggies longer than most . It shows . This welldesigned , $62 short features a light Supplex nylon shell , a DuPont Lycra-brand inner short equal in quality to top spandex models , seamless crotch , and CoolMax chamois . We also cottoned to the understated cool of the hieroglyphics-inspired leg bands . We just wish these shorts had one closable pocket and a more lightweight inner short . 4 . Bellwether Sanded Cordura Bellwether is just one of many larger , established cycling companies getting into the baggy market , but it 's doing a better job than most . These $65 shorts fit well and look good . There 's a lot to like here : stretch nylon mesh liner with grippers , deli ciously soft Ultrasuede chamois , zippered rear pocket ( plus 2 hip pockets and inner key pocket ) , seamless crotch , tough Cordura shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust , and the shell 's a bit heavy . <p>
