TARRANT FOUND THE blind man in the back of the cave . Sitting against the rear sandstone wall , the man was naked , his milkywhite eyes open and unblinking . His thick-lipped mouth hung open , and dirt-streaked saliva trailed from his chin to his soft thighs . At first Tarrant thought the man might be dead , but then he saw the slow , deep intake of breath - chest filling , nostrils quavering - then a few moments later a long , slow exhalation . <p> It was nearly a full minute before he took another breath . <p> Tarrant crouched in front of the blind man , gazing at him . The cave was small , in the lower foothills just outside Los Gatos ; though Tarrant had often hiked through the area , he had never seen the cave before . Today he had taken a long lunch-break from the lab , had driven to the base of the hills as he often did , and had set off on one of his regular treks through the trees . A half hour into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to the side of a large boulder , where he was certain that before there had been only dirt and brush . The rainstorm the day before , Tarrant decided , must have opened the cave . <p> As he crouched in front of the motionless figure , Tarrant wondered how long the blind man had been sitting in this place . The ground under the soft flesh was packed hard and worn smooth , as though he might have been sitting there for weeks ... or even longer . Tarrant leaned forward , inspecting the naked man , and a sudden chill traced over his face and arms - the blind man 's long pale hair seemed to have rooted into the surface of the cave wall behind him . <p> How long had this man been here ? How had he stayed alive ? Had someone been caring for him , feeding him ? Tarrant looked around at the loose dirt of the cave floor . There were only his own footprints . <p> Tarrant waved his hand back and forth in front of the man 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tarrant said . " Hey ! " Still no response . Was the man deaf as well ? Or maybe asleep . Did blind people sleep with their eyes open ? <p> He should do something , Tarrant thought . Bring the man back to town , to a hospital , or call an ambulance , something . Tarrant reached out and touched the blind man on the shoulder . The skin was cool , nearly cold , and unnaturally smooth . The man did n't move , did n't even flinch . Tarrant took a firm hold of the blind man 's shoulder and gave him a brisk shake . " Hello ? Can you hear me ? " <p> The blind man cried out , arched his body , and the cave walls moaned as rubble shook loose and crumbled away , showering down on Tarrant and the blind man . Tarrant released the man and staggered back . The blind man twisted where he sat , head anchored to the wall by his hair , then vomited up a black chunky fluid . The ground shook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cave walls , and the blind man jerked his head back and forth , making a choking sound . <p> Then , just as quickly as it had begun , everything calmed . The blind man went silent and settled back against the cave wall , motionless . The ground stopped shaking . Except for Tarrant 's heart pounding in his ears , everything was quiet . <p> Tarrant remained on his hands and knees for a few moments , staring at the dead eyes of the naked blind man , then got to his feet and ran out of the cave . <p> The large , black sphere - hovering high above him in its stasis field - trembled slightly , then shook once with an enormous jolt . The Regulator noted the movement ( two circles flashing red on the wall console before him , then quickly fingered a keyboard , and brought the sphere back to relative stability . <p> He looked over the vast chamber , at the huge dark sphere above him , and confirmed with his own eyes that it continued to tremble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of displays and readouts and light columns on the wall . His breath was smoke in the cold air . Only his hands and head were visible outside the bulky , convoluted black pressure suit . <p> His attention shifted constantly between the sphere , the readouts and displays and light columns , and his suit monitor . Occasionally his fingers flicked across one of the keyboards , or brushed a strip of glowing squares . A droplet of ice formed on the tip of his nose . <p> The Regulator turned and gazed at the sphere , and wondered what had caused the instability of the system . <p> In a dark Berlin apartment , Ulrike Walter woke with a start . A sharp pain arced through her belly , but she thought it was a sound that had awakened her , not the pain . Somebody crying out ? <p> Ulrike lay in bed , listening , but could hear only traffic sounds outside , loud and regular . She sat up . The lighted crucifix at the end of the bed cast flickering dark shadows across the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her donations to the International Ministries of the Heart , the shadows had frightened her , but she was familiar with them now and could easily pray herself back to sleep when she awakened . <p> The pain eased somewhat but continued to pulse through her . She lay with her eyes barely open , murmuring the secret IMH prayers she had received by mail . <p> In the middle of the Third Prayer of Repose , a loud thought broke into the middle of everything . I must go to America . <p> America ? That was crazy . What made her think that ? She resumed her prayers . <p> Go to America . <p> Although it made her fear for her soul , she ceased praying for a moment . What about her job , she thought , and what about money ? And how long in America ? She did n't know anyone there . She had thought that someday she might make the trip , but certainly not now . <p> The knife-pain in her stomach flared up . She stifled a moan and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the pain gouged into her at every syllable . <p> Why was this ? What was happening to her ? <p> She knew she was a weak person , perhaps prone to hysteria , but the pain .... <p> A pale globe seemed to form out of the ceiling over her head . She knew it was only some trick of her tired eyes and the shadows from the crucifix light . She prayed and the sphere made a noise like a sudden exhalation of breath . Her eyes opened wide , convinced the figment would now vanish , but it did n't ; <p> It was a face protruding through the plaster of her ceiling , a thick lipped moronic-looking face , and though the eyes were open , there was nothing in them . <p> Ulrike prayed rapidly , knowing that everything in her life was at the desire of Jesus , all things , the fall of every sparrow , and she prayed rapidly , not taking her eyes off the face , until something wet and slow and thick dropped onto her cheek , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ in her body was being attacked with thoms . <p> Go to America . <p> " Yes , " Ulrike gasped , " yes , yes , I 'll go , I 'll go . " <p> And as easily as that , the face and the pain were gone . <p> Ulrike murmured the First Prayer of Acceptance , over and over until morning , and then she packed a small bag and went to the airport where she joined the other haggard , sleepless travelers who filled up the seats near her , all waiting for the first available flight . <p> When Tarrant got back to the med lab , Muskie and Vang were cleaning up . The place was a mess - glassware broken , fluids spilled , electrical equipment down or sputtering smoke . Something had blown up , and over in the corner , brown liquid dripped from the ceiling . <p> Muskie was laughing , and waved as Tarrant crossed the room . " Man , you really missed something , " Muskie said . " It put us back about three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Vang 's expression when he pulled all his fried little cultures out of the incubator . You shoulda seen it . He looked like he 'd lost his best friend . Knowing Vang , he probably did . " <p> " What , an earthquake ? " Tarrant asked , thinking of the ground shaking inside the cave . <p> " Nope . That would have made more sense . Nothing shook at all , exactly , but all hell broke loose . First thing that happened , the coffee pot exploded . " He gestured at the dripping brown stains . <p> " A good thing , " Vang grumbled from the back corner , where he had the cover up on one of the centrifuges . " Save us from pancreatic cancer . " <p> Through the heavy glass partition that separated the pathology lab from Electrophysiology , Tarrant saw Pascali bent over one of his new digital 12-lead EKG units . Through the open glass door , Tarrant heard the old Italian cursing the machine . <p> " Pascali was speaking in tongues for twenty minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his colleagues , feeling like his announcement would be an anticlimax . " I found something a little strange during my walk today . Does the phone still work ? " <p> " Forget the phone . Check the waiting room , straighten it out , all right ? " Muskie said to him . " We do n't want our subjects to come in here and get their bowels in an uproar . " <p> " I found a guy in a cave , about a quarter of a mile from here . Blind , deaf , maybe , and - " <p> " Hobo , " Vang said , dropping the remains of the coffee pot into a trash can and watching the pyrex disintegrate . " Big deal . " <p> Tarrant could see Muskie and Vang had no interest in his find . Looking at the mess in the two labs , he could understand . He crossed the room and stuck his head into Pascali 's lab . <p> " Hey . Pascali . " <p> Pascali looked up , frowning . " What the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants something . " <p> " I just want to borrow one of your portable 12-lead ERGs tomorrow at lunchtime . I 've got something I need to check out . " <p> " What , find out if your girlfriend 's got a heart ? " <p> " Pascali ... " <p> The old man nodded . " Sure , sure , if the damn thing still works . Just take care of it , all right ? " Pascali turned back to his new EKG unit , cursed again , and kicked the table it sat on . <p> " Thanks , Pascali . I 'll take care of it . " <p> " Hey ! " Muskie called . " Tarrant ! The waiting room ? " <p> Tarrant nodded . " All right , I 'll see what I can do . " <p> The Regulator paced slowly along the banks of displays and readouts . He had been unable to bring about complete stability , and the fluctuations continued - a number flashing , a light column circling erratically , a depression pulsing when it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tapped at keyboards . <p> He had , hopefully , set in motion the processes which would return the sphere to complete stability , but he did not know how long that would take , and until then he had to prevent the deviation from worsening . <p> The Regulator stopped for a moment and glanced at the huge black sphere . It continued to tremble . <p> HALFWAY INTO the flight , the pilot announced goodnaturedly that because of unforeseen factors they would be arriving in San Francisco two hours early . Ulrike 's concentration had been numbed by exhaustion , and at first the announcement meant nothing to her . <p> Then it struck her that the flight was supposed to go to Los Angeles . She sat up for a moment , looked around to see if anyone else was surprised . Everyone in the plane , including the stewardesses , looked numbed and dull , the same as she felt . <p> The attendants would listlessly mumble to the passengers , probably asking them what they wanted to drink . The passengers would not respond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it was picked up and thrown away . <p> Ulrike tediously dug through her purse for her ticket - it was so much work . She was almost sure the ticket listed Los Angeles as the destination . When she found it , she took it out and flipped it open . The destination slot was blank . So was the rest of the ticket . The right half of the ticket had nothing at all on it - the print had faded away . <p> For a brief moment Ulrike was terrified , but then , just as quickly , she realized it all had to be a part of her Lord 's plans . She breathed slowly and deeply several times , calming herself . Then , staring at the empty ticket , she silently began the Fourth Prayer of Contemplation of the Mysteries . <p> Tarrant entered the cave , breathing heavily from carrying all the equipment up the hillside - portable 12-lead , blood pressure cuff , phlebotomy tray . He stood just inside the cave , shoulders aching , and let his eyes adjust to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , motionless against the cave wall , eyes open , and saliva continued to string from his thick lips to his folded legs . Tarrant laid out all his equipment on the cave floor , and began setting things up . <p> Simple things first , Tarrant told himself . Blood pressure , run an EKG . Then ... then try to stick him for a little blood . <p> Tarrant was careful andgentle as he wrapped the cuff around the blind man 's left arm . He had a hell of a time picking up the man 's pulse , mainly because it was so slow-like his respiration - down to about six or seven beats a minute . Once he felt it , he started pumping air into the cuff . <p> As the pressure increased , slight tremors moved through the blind man , then through the cave floor . <p> " What the hell ... ? " <p> Tarrant stopped pumping , placed the stethoscope , and twisted the air release valve . At that moment , the floor of the cave calmed . Tarrant waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first tone came through . More waiting . Eventually he felt the second tone , but never did hear it . Jesus . Thirty-four over palp . The guy should be about dead . What was he , in hibernation ? <p> He removed the cuff and set things up for the EKG . He placed half a dozen electrodes on the man 's chest , struggling to get them to stick to the almost slimy skin , strapped bands around the man 's wrists and ankles , then plugged everything into the 12-lead . Tarrant turned on the power and started the EKG , watching the tracing feed emerge from the unit . <p> He 'd expected odd tracings because of the low pulse rate , but not as strange as he was now getting . All three lines in the AVR lead were completely straight , as if the electrodes were n't picking up anything at all . Even the lines in leads I-III were strange , with dozens of tiny jumps between peaks of the QRS complexes , as though the ventricles were fibrillating constantly between beats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , then shut everything down and packed it away , tucking the printouts into his coat pocket . He 'd have Pascali take a look at them . Something was wrong with this person . <p> Now , though , came the difficult part . Blood . <p> Tarrant prepared a drawing syringe and several vacuum tubes , though he had a feeling he 'd be lucky to get even one . The blind man trembled , his arm twitched , and he moaned softly when Tarrant tied the tourniquet on the left arm to bring up a vein . Tarrant felt like shouting at the man , yelling at him to knock it the hell off , he was trying to help him . <p> Another tremor ran through the floor of the cave . <p> A vein gradually appeared , fat and dark . Tarrant swabbed with alcohol , placed the needle point on the skin , braced himself , and drove the needle in . <p> The blind man howled and bucked , twisting violently , but Tarrant held tight and kept the needle in the vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the syringe as Tarrant pulled back the plunger . The ground convulsed , the blind man moaned and howled , yanking and twisting in Tarrant 's grip . Dirt crumbled and fell from the cave roof . <p> Losing control , Tarrant released the tourniquet , jerked out the syringe and stumbled back , landing on his butt . The earth tremors and the blind man 's own convulsions continued , and Tarrant was afraid to move . <p> Then , like the first time , the shaking abruptly ceased . The blind man became still , and the haze of dust slowly settled throughout the cave , except where it landed on the blind man . There , strangely , it danced and slid away , as if the dust and the skin carried opposing electrical charges . <p> Tarrant got to his feet , syringe still in his hand . He quickly pumped the blood into a vacuum tube , packed up everything then with one last look at the blind man , hurried out of the cave . <p> The fluctuations were getting worse . Another massive jolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to soften the subsequent vibration , the sphere continued to shake , and threatened to destabilize completely . <p> The Regulator moved more quickly now , from one danger point to another , keying corrections into the keyboards , running his fingers along strips of light , depressing glowing plates he could barely reach . Behind and far above him , the sphere trembled and shook . <p> The pilot announced that they were passing over New York City . <p> Ulrike sighed heavily , but otherwise did not react much . Several hours earlier , the plane had left New York City . She glanced out the window now and saw the Statue of Liberty waist deep in the harbor . She wondered for a moment if there would be enough fuel to keep flying all the way to San Francisco , but then assured herself that Jesus would provide . Ulrike looked back at the movie screen . <p> She thought they must be playing the third or fourth movie now - a comedy , as nearly as she could tell , about a man reincarnated as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodically broke into images of grotesque violence , cannibalism , and blood-drinking . <p> Abruptly and without explanation , the screen blanked and the stewardesses again began lethargically distributing drinks and food - the second full meal of the flight . <p> Like the other passengers , Ulrike observed passively , sat quietly , accepted what was given her , and waited only for her arrival in San Francisco . Or wherever . <p> Tarrant barely made it back to the lab . His car kept dying , and if it had n't been downhill most of the way , he 'd have had to walk back . All the new potholes , which had n't been there on his way up , did n't help much either . As it was , he coasted into the tiny parking lot and just managed to get the car into one of the spaces . <p> When he entered the lab , Vang and Muskie were , as usual , bent over their work , Muskie staring through his microscope , counting blood cells , and Vang putting a few numbers at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen . <p> " Listen , " Tarrant said , putting the case on a stool and talking to their backs , " either this EKG 's blown its little mechanical mind , or I 've found someone who 's got only part of a heart and the weirdest looking blood I 've - " <p> " We 've been discussing how to murder you , " Muskie said , making a few more checks on his eosinophil column . <p> " What ? " <p> " You know , " Vang said , " planning your demise , separating your various pieces in a lethal manner . " <p> " What are you guys talking about ? I 'm trying to tell you , I 've found someone extraordinary , someone who 's honest-to-god unique . " <p> " Vang suggested keeping you half-sedated and cutting off little parts over a long period of time , " Muskie said , putting a big check in the basophil column . " I told him his ethnicity was showing . " <p> " We agreed to keep it simple and shotgun you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen . " The American way . " <p> " Yeah , " Muskie agreed . " Ten gauge to the head . " <p> Tarrant noticed Pascali standing in the doorway , glaring at him but not saying a word . <p> " What 's going on here ? What 're you guys talking about ? " <p> " Because , " Muskie said , " every time you walk out of here , everything goes to hell . You see what I 'm counting here ? Look at this . " He held up the chart . <p> Tarrant looked at it a moment and said , " Jesus Christ , what did you test , your tuna sandwich ? " <p> " He looked like a person to me , " Muskie said . " But I could 've been wrong . " <p> " Aliens , " Vang said . " We got an alien infestation . Look at what Pascali 's got . " <p> Pascali waved Tarrant over to a terminal just inside his lab . " Here in front of me , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EKG of Miss Ravinder Chilatavong . Care to glance at it , Tarrant ? " <p> Across the screen were nine parallel scribbles , all of them dense and nasty-looking with dozens of fluctuations between the complexes , lines that should n't have come out of the EKG box - and an AVR series that was utterly blank . <p> Tarrant looked at Pascali , at Vang , and then at Muskie . <p> " What is all this ? " he asked quietly . <p> " Take a look at our new coffee pot , " Vang said . <p> Over in the corner , the wall and the floor were splashed brown . Shattered pyrex had blown across the counter and lay in the sink and in the puddle on the floor . <p> Muskie wadded up his count-sheet and dropped it on the floor . " We 're a tiny lab , guys , and if we turn in results like this , the docs are going to think we 're over here having ether parties . We 'll be selling aluminum siding next month . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cave gave me the same kind of reading . Maybe something happened to our equipment . " <p> " This , " Muskie said , " is a microscope . You look through it and you see what 's at the other end . What can go wrong with that ? We 've got something very serious here , Tarrant , and I do n't know what it is , but two days now , you leave for your postprandial stroll and about half an hour later , the coffee pot blows up and everything turns to shit . " His face was red now . " What the hell are you doing out there besides destroying our lab ? How are you doing it ? " <p> " That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . Look , for Christ 's sake . " He held up the tube of blood he 'd managed to draw from the blind man . It was dark indigo in color , nearly black . <p> " What 's that ? " Pascali asked . " Ink ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy I found in the cave . " He looked at Vang . " The guy you said was a hobo . ' Big deal , ' you said . " <p> Vang shrugged . " I still say big deal . We measure reality here , not make up stories for the National Inquirer . " <p> Tarrant shook his head and proceeded to tell them the whole story , everything that had happened since he 'd first seen the open cave . They did n't believe him . <p> " You want to tell us some halfwit moron is causing all this crap ? " Muskie said , gesturing at the lab messes . " What 's he supposed to be , some mutant with paranormal powers ? Or-what is it , Vang-the thing about Shiva dreaming the world , and if he wakes up , we 're all history . Maybe you found Shiva - in California . That make sense to you , Tarrant ? Bullshit . Bums and earthquakes - no connection . " <p> " And it blows up our coffee pot just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You white people are crazy . " <p> All Pascali said was , " I 'd like to run an EEG on this guy , see what 's going on inside his head . " <p> Tarrant nodded . " That 's exactly what I want to do . Just check it out . What could it hurt ? I mean , what could it hurt ? " <p> The Regulator was losing control . No new disruptions had hit the system , but the sphere continued shaking . The air around him crackled and hissed , and he thought the temperature in the chamber was rising . <p> The Regulator could not quite keep up with the warnings that flashed at him across the wall , though he moved quickly from one trouble spot to the next , pounding at the keyboards , flicking charged toggles , adjusting dials and strips and elevated columns . He was sweating heavily now , and the suit 's cooling units kicked in . He did not know how long he could maintain stability . <p> ULRIKE WALTER stood in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many other passengers remained quite calm . Apparently flights were coming in inexplicably late or early . The electronic nerve-net on which the airport depended had begun to behave erratically , and passengers by the hundreds were blithely walking through security checks without pausing . <p> At one point , Ulrike glanced up at an arrival-departure monitor , and instead of seeing the usual text naming cities and flight numbers , she saw a human shape being consumed in flames . The monitor cabinets changed colors , shifting randomly from one glowing hue to another . <p> As she moved through the terminal , a dense fog began to drift along the floor , passing unhindered through the solid glass windows . It floated around Ulrike , cool and comforting . <p> She was not disturbed . She thought nothing . She went out the hissing doors and , with hundreds of other calm baggageless passengers , she waited for the bus she knew would take her south and into the mountains . <p> Vang stayed in the lab while Tarrant led Muskie and the grumbling Pascali back through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voltmeter they 'd hooked up to the lab 's electrical supply and examine a few blood samples both now and after they returned . They 'd borrowed a coffee pot from Vang 's mother , and when they 'd left , Vang was eating a sandwich and counting Muskie 's leukocytes , the smell of fresh coffee filling the air . <p> Up on the hill , however , there was no aroma of fresh coffee , only a faintly rancid smell . Pascali looked at the cave opening . " We 're supposed to go in there ! " he said . " Jesus . " It was late afternoon by now , and storm clouds had rolled in , blocking out the sun . Inside the cave it was dark , quiet . <p> Tarrant said nothing but stooped low and stepped under the bushy outcropping and into the gloom . Muskie followed him with the portable EEG module in the aluminum case , and Pascali came last , muttering about bats . <p> When Tarrant shined the flashlight on the naked man , Muskie gasped and Pascali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " Pascali asked , his voice now low and professional . <p> " This is the third day that I know of , but the first day , the floor showed no footprints but my own , and I saw his hair had grown into the sandstone wall behind his head . " <p> Muskie stared at him a moment , muttered , " Bullshit , " and then snapped the case open . " Shine that down here , I ca n't see what I 'm doing . " <p> In the half-light Pascali knelt and began hooking the battery to the oscilloscope . <p> " He does n't like to be touched , " Tarrant told Muskie as he pulled out the contact pads and untangled the wires . " I mean , he really does n't like to be touched . " <p> " What 's he going to do , " Muskie said , " drool on met Get the light on the side of his head . " <p> " Just go easy , " Tarrant whispered . <p> " Scope 's ready , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its light . Tarrant looked down and saw the smooth lines suddenly spike and dance , filling up the small screen . <p> The blind man moaned softly - Muskie had the first contact above the left ear . <p> Pascali clicked several knobs . " This does n't look right , " he mumbled . <p> " I ca n't see this , " Muskie complained as he tried to part the man 's hair for the second contact . " Get the light here . " Tarrant moved the flashlight . When the second electrode touched skin , the oscilloscope flared brilliantly , filling the cave with green light . <p> Pascali gasped . " I saw - ! I saw something ! " <p> " Good , " Muskie murmured . " We know your retinas are functional . " <p> " No , I mean .... " Pascali was pointing at the screen that now fluttered and flashed erratically . " I saw a man with a ... wearing a pressure suit or something ! " <p> Muskie breathed heavily , working on another electrode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get too weird , all right ? " <p> Pascali stared into the green light . " His face was ... it was n't human . " <p> " Jesus Christ , " Muskie said , " I ca n't see a god damned thing back here and you 're down there on the ground hallucinating . " He bumped the naked man 's head and the idiot moaned . " Maybe I can just hold these in place . What are you getting ? " <p> Tarrant thought he felt the cave floor tremble . <p> Pascali 's face was bright with sweat . " This is n't ... I think this must have been knocked around on our way up here . It 's not giving me .... " He turned the dials , the soft clicks sounding gauzy and unreal in the musty air . He cranked up the gain , tried adding and dropping frequency filters . <p> " If it is working right , " Tarrant said , " what does it mean ? " <p> " It means .... " He took a deep breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition approaching brain death , but here - " He kept playing with the dials , making adjustments . " But ... I do n't know , at the same time it indicates some kind of intense , organized activity . It does n't make any - " <p> The screen fluttered and flashed again . <p> " God damn it , " Muskie said . <p> " I saw it again ! " Pascali said . " He was there again ! " <p> " You did n't see anything " Muskie snapped , pulling away the contacts . " We ca n't get shit with me holding these things in place-it screws everything up . " <p> " But I saw - " <p> " Let 's get the goon out of here , " Muskie said . " This is ridiculous . I was n't trained to work in the dark . " <p> Pascali still stared into the screen , which now showed only smooth lines . " If we took him back to the lab we could arrange to image his head with the MR over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got here . " <p> Muskie had already stuffed the contacts back in the aluminum case and had moved to the far side of the naked man . " Get his other arm , Tarrant . Let 's get him out of here and get some light on the subject . You gather up our stuff , " he said to Pascali . <p> " We have to be careful , " Tarrant said . " Every time I moved him - " <p> " Just get him under his other arm , " Muskie said . <p> Tarrant reached down , hesitated , then took hold of the blind man 's arm and shoulder . <p> " Now , " Muskie said . <p> They lifted . The ground shook violently for a moment , and dirt fell from the cave roof . <p> " Let him go ! Let him go ! " Tarrant shouted . " Every time I 've moved him , that 's happened . " <p> Muskie glared at him through the falling dust . " It 's an earthquake , asshole . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The tremors had ceased and the dirt settled , but they could n't move the blind man any farther - his hair was still rooted firmly in the cave wall . <p> " Tarrant , " Muskie said , " pull his hair out of the dirt there , will you ? Then we can get him out of here . " <p> " No , " Tarrant said , " I do n't think - " <p> " Jesus . You brought us up here . Just yank his god damned hair loose and we can get on with this . " <p> " I do n't think - " <p> Muskie stepped around the naked man and swept his hand between head and wall . <p> Tarrant heard a ripping sound as the blind man 's hair tore free of the cave wall . An electrical jolt burst through Tarrant , and suddenly he could n't see a thing . He heard Pascali , or perhaps it was Muskie , screaming something about his eyes . Everything seemed milky , muffled , and very slow . <p> Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grasped ? ... whatever it was had turned hard and knobby , like an old tree limb , and something dribbled from his hands down his arm and dripped off his elbow ... why could n't he see ? Why did n't he care ? He tried to release what he was holding , but his hands would n't come free . Krazy Glue , he thought absurdly . Where was he ? <p> He thought he was moving , staggering , dragging something in some direction , though he could n't feel his feet , and at the moment he at last realized something had gone terribly wrong , at that moment , he was hit by a wall of light and slammed to the ground . <p> Red erupted across the wall . <p> Light columns pulsed rapidly with angry crimson , circles of glaring red flashed at the Regulator . Alarm bells sounded , clanging through the chamber . <p> The stasis field was malfunctioning . <p> The Regulator turned , looked up at the black sphere , which now trembled violently . Tiny filaments of electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suit monitors blinked red into his eyes ; the Regulator hit the emergency panels and he heard the clicks and hissing of the vents opening in all the walls , heard the rush of the clear blue gel-fluid pouring into the chamber . The Regulator held his hands away from him , fingered the green tab inside his left wrist . <p> The clear helmet emerged from his neck collar , quickly formed a bubble over his head , then sealed ; air hissed , the suit 's internal circulation and heat systems kicking in . Two more flexible , contoured bubbles emerged from the wrist collars , sealed over his hands like gloves as the gel fluid poured into the chamber at an incredible rate and reached as high as his waist . <p> The clear blue fluid continued to flood the chamber , and the Regulator watched it rise , watched the sphere shaking above him , watched the swirl of electric color around it as the stasis field weakened , sputtered , threatened to completely collapse . <p> The fluid rose to his neck , then a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up toward the sphere . <p> Ulrike sat quietly in the bus as it rounded the mountain curves and lurched over deep black potholes . Ahead of the bus , like a great metalbacked caterpillar , other buses trailed each other at high speed with no more than half a meter separating them . She looked down at the limp purse she held in her lap and began reciting the Second Canticle of Trust . Her fingers , neatly folded over the black leather , separated from her hands and crawled over her lap like worms . <p> Her mouth opened , but no sound came out as she broke off her murmuring , in desperation she began saying to herself the Hymn of Horror ... no , that was n't right . The Hymn of Heaven . Yes . The Hymn of <p> As she began the opening lines , she looked up and saw a wide , black chasm crossing the narrow road . It could not have been caused by an earthquake - it could n't have been caused by ... anything . It was like an erasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the asphalt , and beyond it rose up a milky vagueness , without trees or sky or ground . <p> She tried to call from memory the Prayer of Failure , no , of Feigningshe was so confused ! The Prayer of Fantasy - no , not right either . <p> Her fingers melted into gobs of red slime and the man next to her began frantically tearing his clothes off his body . He had black scales over his chest , and his lips became hard and thin with sharp nubs of teeth behind them . <p> The bus was enveloped in whiteness and silence , and when Ulrike screamed , there was no sound , not even a whisper . <p> The Regulator rose from the floor , adrift in the thick fluid . He thought he could feel the cold seeping through the suit , overwhelming the heating units , but he knew that was impossible . <p> He drifted slowly upward , gazing at the dark sphere now shaking violently , the gel-fluid not quite high enough yet . Then a few seconds later the fluid reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly enveloped it , and rose the rest of the way to the ceiling . The chamber was full . <p> Nothing moved . The sphere , its stasis field completely neutralized , no longer shook , no longer trembled . It floated without rising , its buoyancy perfectly neutral . <p> The Regulator 's new sea-like world was nearly silent . The air circ system hummed quietly inside the suit ; his own breath was a series of regular hisses . He moved his legs and arms , awkwardly swimming upward . <p> Figures glowed brightly on the sphere , delicate patterns of bright green that might have been letters or ideographs . He swam toward the sphere , then drifted in front of it for a minute , staring at the glowing markings , trying to make some sense of them . Then he moved forward , stretched his arms and legs wide ; the Regulator drifted , spread-eagled until he made contact with the sphere , then wrapped his limbs across the dark black metal and green glowing figures . He pressed his helmeted face against the sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain worked like an erratically flashing light bulb . For a few moments it would work and he could think , more or less , and then his thoughts would black out , and when he could see again , everything had changed . <p> In the moments he was conscious , he kept getting momentary flashes of bizarre images , of vast violence , of cannibalism and blood-drinking , of screaming mobs tearing bodies apart with their hands , of thundering destructive earthquakes , and of a world drowned in blood that would quench none of the endless fires . <p> He seemed to be ... in the mountains , standing in the open air , with Muskie and Pascali , and at their feet lay the smiling , unconscious body of .... <p> ( torrents of fire swelled from the earth like virgin springs , incinerating the screaming helpless who stood lashed tight to stakes ) <p> Tarrant 's feeble attention was drawn to movement below him , down the mountainside . Gleaming silver buses disgorged hundreds of passengers who walked as though they were numb and half blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embankment and began clawing their way up toward them . <p> Tarrant wanted to ask Muskie , beside him , why this was happening .... <p> ( holding a knife high above his head , in the perfect air , the man shouted , " My obedience , my honor , my love , my life , my God ! " and brought the blade down in a violent strike , burying it with a ripping slash in his own intestines ) <p> " Muskie ? Where are you ? Pascali ? " <p> In blinks and flashes , he saw the exhausted mass slowly making their way up the mountainside . They were dressed in odd , colorful clothes , many of the men wearing narrow-brimmed canvas hats and shorts , some in heavy coats , while the women were dressed in everything from expensive formal wear with glittery jewelry to jeans with daypacks . <p> Tourists , Tarrant thought . Tourists in tour buses ? What in hell is .... <p> ( men in chain mail , on rearing horses inside a cathedral , slashing at screaming worshippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bellies ) <p> At his feet sprawled the naked idiot , legs bent like the figure 4 , and his eyes slightly opened , but with only white showing . Through his parted lips , passed a dull " Uhhhh .... " <p> As Tarrant stared down at him , trying to imagine what he had done to cause this , reality began flickering in and out rapidly , fibrillating , and in the spaces between seeing the sprawled idiot and the approaching , dullfaced tourists , Tarrant saw what Pascali must have seen in the oscilloscope . <p> Against a field of blue , floated a pressure-suited black figure , and inside the bubble that blossomed out of the shoulders was a face that was not human - there was a stiff look to the skin , and something strange about the eyes . <p> Tarrant could see its lips moving , but the clattery voice faded in and out . Theblack figure touched a lightedbar on his chest and his words came in more clearly , in English , at least . <p> " Return ... return the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cave . " <p> Tarrant gave up all pretense of self-control and assumptions about the rational world following known rules . <p> As quickly as the black figure had appeared across his vision , it vanished , but everything around him , the mountains , the trees and brush , the tourists , Muskie and Pascali , everything had a queer heaving quality to it , as though the reality-screen on which everything was projected was about to rip . <p> Tarrant struggled to move toward Muskie , and when he looked into Muskie 's stunned eyes , he knew he was seeing the same distorted world . <p> " Muskie - " <p> No response . <p> " Muskie ! " He grabbed a handful of his shirt collar and gave it one shake . " Help me move him ! " <p> Muskie 's eyes focused on Tarrant 's face . " What did we do ? " he mumbled slackly . <p> " Help me move him ! " He pulled Muskie forward by the shirt collar . " Take his arm . Reach down , god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they first moved him , light and darkness flickered around Tarrant , but he tried to keep his feet under him and his hands on the soft flesh of the moaning idiot . <p> " Pull , Muskie ! " Tarrant yelled into his face . " Come on ! " Muskie whimpered , his eyes widening and then squinting as he looked down at the soft body they dragged toward the cave mouth . Suddenly Muskie yanked his hands away , staring at the idiot , his teeth bared and his breath rough in his throat . <p> " Muskie- ! " <p> But then Tarrant saw that the thing they carried was now roughscaled , black , more reptile than human , and it looked up at them with helpless and malignant eyes . Tarrant wondered if it was still blind . <p> Across Tarrant 's perceptions , the pressure-suited figure reappeared and commanded , " Return the god to His place of meditation . " <p> Tarrant reached across and slapped Muskie . Muskie looked up at him , eyes wide , then backed away and dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tarrant shouted . <p> Muskie did n't respond . But then Pascali appeared at Tarrant 's side and said , " I 'll help you . " The old Italian seemed quite calm . Pascali moved around to the other side of the idiot , bent over and took an arm . <p> The idiot hissed at them as they began dragging him toward the cave . Sharp , metallic teeth glinted in its mouth . Then the scales began multiplying , shrinking in size and increasing in number , rippling across the idiot 's body as they changed color from deep black to pale white . <p> Just as they reached the mouth of the cave , extra limbs sprouted across the thing 's body-pale and fragile arms emerged from the neck and chest , and short , thick legs grew from the belly and thighs . It refused to be one thing , as though its reality had become unsettled . <p> Tarrant almost released his grip , but Pascali shook his head and said , " Hang on . " Tarrant hung on . <p> On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long thin toes and fingers sprouted and waved gently , mesmerizing Tarrant . Pascali called to him , breaking him out of a trance . And then , as Tarrant and Pascall resumed dragging the naked thing , the extra limbs melted away and the body began to glow , illuminating the interior of the cave . <p> The scales began rippling again , turning a deep , blood-red . Fingers and toes transformed into dark , sharp claws , and it hissed at them again . The milky white film over its eyes faded , then returned , glowed bright crimson like the scales , then turned white once more . <p> The ground rumbled , and the light around them flickered . Tarrant did n't know if it was the beast 's glow that flickered , or his own vision . He and Pascali dragged it deeper into the cave , toward the wall that had held its hair . <p> The thing no longer struggled , but it continued to hiss at them . The scales melted away , replaced by a rough , knobby hide . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn by an incredibly clear , plastic-film skin . Arteries and veins , muscle and organs , cartilage and bone - all of it abnormally shaped and linked - were clearly visible inside the body . <p> They finally reached the back wall , and Tarrant and Pascali propped the blind idiot into a sitting position , head and back against the sandstone wall . The thing 's hair snaked away from its head and rooted itself in the wall . Tarrant and Pascali released its arms , and backed away . <p> The idiot seemed to grow larger as they watched . The flabbiness of its limbs smoothed away , and the muscle increased , flexing , firming . One last time , it hissed through its metallic teeth . <p> " Jesus . " Tarrant stood motionless , staring at it . The clear vinyl skin turned milky , became shiny and solid , yet still it gave off a bright glow . Even the film over its eyes glowed . Limbs and digits flexed . Its teeth clicked together , growing longer and sharper even as Tarrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the hell out of here , " he said to Pascali . He backed away toward the cave mouth , but Pascali did n't move ; the old Italian just stared at the monstrous thing glowing and hissing and clicking in the darkness of the cave . " Pascali , come on . " <p> Pascali finally turned and looked at Tarrant . He nodded once , then with a long look back at it , he followed Tarrant out of the cave . <p> Outside , a strange , strobe-like flickering illuminated the growing darkness . The tourists from the buses , led by a tall , blonde woman , were climbing up the hillside , headed directly for the cave . Muskie still crouched in the dirt , whimpering . <p> " Go back ! " Tarrant shouted . " For Christ 's sake , go back ! " <p> They all stopped except for the blonde woman in the lead . She continued up the hill , making for the cave mouth . Tarrant moved in front of her , blocking the way . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's ... there 's something horrible inside . " <p> The woman just smiled gently at him . After a moment , she said , very softly , " My Lord awaits me . " <p> The woman started forward again , and , feeling helpless , Tarrant stepped back and let her pass . Unable to move , unable to utter a sound , he watched her enter the cave . <p> ULRIKE ENTERED the cave , then paused for a moment . The glowing light pulsed gently from the rear of the cave , and she could feel it enter her with a healing warmth . The light and heat coursed through her , bright and glowing . <p> She moved farther into the cave . The heat and light increased , washing over and through her , enclosing and purging her at the same time . The cave walls shimmered , and an incredibly soothing warmth rose from the cave floor . <p> When she reached the back of the cave , she stopped in front of a brilliant white presence ... her Lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but the Heat . Both increased around her and within her , and she realized she was becoming One with her Lord . <p> Heat and Light , Light and Heat , growing and cleansing , swelling inside her . Then it all came together and blossomed in glory . <p> Tarrant stood by the cave mouth , watching the light flickering inside it . Muskie , though still on his hands and knees , seemed to have regained some of his senses . <p> " Why did n't you stop her ? ' he asked Tarrant . <p> Tarrant opened his mouth , but had trouble speaking . " I ... I ... " <p> " He could n't , " Pali said . His voice was still calm " No one could have . " <p> Tarrant knew Pascali was right , but he did n't take much comfort from the old man 's words . <p> A tremendous roar erupted from the cave , followed by a rending scream that was quickly choked off . A wet crunching sound came from within , then quickly ceased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists on the slope below . They stampeded , not down the hill as Tarrant had expected , but up the hill and toward the cave . Pasted on their faces were ecstatic smiles , eyes were open wide and glittering , and they held their arms out , ready to embrace ... what ? <p> Tarrant scrambled out of the way as the tourists converged on the cave and rushed inside . It was a screaming frenzied mob , and Tarrant knew there was no stopping them . He stood beside Pascali , watching the tourists fight their way inside . Muskie got to his feet , swayed unsteadily for a few moments , then put his hand on Tarrant 's shoulder for support . <p> " What the hell is going on ? " Muskie 's voice was hoarse . <p> Tarrant shook his head . How could he know ? How could any of them know ? <p> Another roar erupted from within the cave , long and continuous , now intercut with cries and screams and shouts of joy . Joy ? Yes , that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The tourists continued to shove and push their way into the cave , maybe three or four hundred altogether , all of them still smiling as they clawed their way inside . Already more people had pressed into the cave than it could possibly hold , Tarrant was certain of that , but they continued to stream into the glowing interior of the hillside . And the roars and screams and shouts sounded from the cave . <p> Madness , Tarrant thought , utter madness . The light and sky continued to flicker around them , and when he looked down the hill he saw that the empty buses hovered a few inches above the ground . He wondered how he could see so well when it was almost night . The sky above , when it was n't flickering white , was nearly black and filled with the immense contours of thunderheads . He thought he could hear rain falling , but he felt none and saw none . <p> The three of them stood on the side of the hill , watching the sky and watching the tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening to the screams , the roars , the choking sounds and cries and shouts and all the rest of the madness . Tarrant felt helpless , frozen by a strange , overriding inertia , overwhelmed by confusion . What could he do ? Nothing but wait until it all was over . <p> Time passed in a kind of numbness . The number of tourists dwindled as they continued to disappear into the cave . No one emerged . Tarrant could no longer focus on what that meant . He turned away from the cave and gazed up at the flickering sky , his attention dissipating in the clouds above . <p> And then , catching him by surprise , silence fell . The last tourist was gone , and when he looked at the cave , it seemed to be empty except for an intense glow of white light coming from the back . <p> The ground lurched once , then swelled and sank , like a long , rolling earthquake . A loud crack sounded , followed by a rumble , and the side of the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending in a small avalanche . <p> The ground stilled , the flickering light above them ceased , and then a heavy downpour drenched them in cold rain from the thunderheads . But less than two minutes after it began , the cloudburst stopped , and the thunderheads rolled away , clearing the sky and revealing bright thickets of stars and a nearly full moon above them , illuminating the hillside with a clean , silver light . <p> Tarrant looked once again at the cave ... except there was no cave anymore . The hillside had collapsed to completely cover its opening , and in fact it looked as if there never had been a cave , and that there had never even been an avalanche . <p> " Down there , " Muskie said softly , pointing down the hill . Tarrant turned , but did n't see anything . Then he realized that was just what Muskie meant : the buses were gone . Trees , earth , sky , all looked as it had earlier in the day . <p> Everything appeared to be back to normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vanished , and without leaving a trace . <p> " We should go back , " Muskie said . " Back to the lab . See how Vang is . " <p> Tarrant nodded absently , still burdened with inertia . <p> " I 'm staying up here for a while , " Pascali said . <p> Tarrant turned to look at the old Italian . <p> Pascali shrugged . " I 've seen some things tonight , " he said . " And I need to think about what I 've seen . So I 'll be back later . " He paused . " I need to think . " <p> " You 're out of your mind , " Muskie said . <p> But Tarrant understood , and he nodded to Pascali . Things were back to normal , but they could never really be normal again . " Let him be , " Tarrant said . " I 'll go back with you . " <p> Muskie started to say something more , but Tarrant abruptly shook his head , cutting him off . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . Tarrant turned to Pascali . " We 'll see you back at the lab . " <p> Pascali nodded . Tarrant and Muskie started down the hill , and as they entered the trees Tarrant stopped and looked back . He saw Pascali sit on a flat rock in front of the spot where the cave had been and stare at the hillside . How could any of them ever see the world the same way again ? What was the world ? He turned back and followed Muskie down the hill , the question ringing over and over in his thoughts . <p> The Regulator stood and gazed out over the chamber , at the wall banks , and at the dark , motionless sphere suspended in the air above him . There was not a trace of movement in the sphere , not a glimmer of abnormal readings anywhere . Everything was stable . Everything was in equilibrium once again . <p> Overall , the disturbance had actually been quite mild . Less than four hundred people destroyed . Nothing compared to some of the disturbances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had occurred before he could intervene to regain stability . This time had been practically nothing . <p> The Regulator turned back to the banks of readouts , checking them all , satisfied . For a while , now , he knew he could relax . <p> He retracted his helmet into the collar of his protective suit , thinking about the inevitable Final Disturbance . As he slowly drew apart his eyelids , he contemplated the fury of the idiot 's dream and the elaborate silence of non-existence.CT <p> Author Affiliation
