I was fourteen that summer . August brought heat I had never known , and during the dreamlike drought of those days , I saw my father for the first time in my life . The tulip poplars had faded to yellow before September came . There was no rain for weeks , and the people 's faces along Eleventh Street wore a longing for something cool and wet , something distant , like the promise of <p> balmy October . Talk of weather was of the heat and the dry taste in their mouths . And they were frustrated , having to notice something other than the weather in their daily pleasantries . Sometimes , in the haven of afternoon porch shade or in the still and cooler places of late night , they drank and laughed , content because they had managed to make it through the day . <p> What I noticed was the way the skin of my neighbors glistened as they toiled in their backyards , trying to save their gardens or working a few more miles into their cars . My own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker and darker , my hair lightening , dispelling my assumption that it had always been a curly black  --  the whole of me a new and stranger blend of browns from day after day of basketball on asphalt courts or racing the other boys down the street after the Icee truck each afternoon . <p> I came to believe that it was the heat that made things happen . It was a summer of empty sidewalks , people I knew drifting in and out of the alleyways where trees gave more shade , the dirt there cooler to walk on than any paved surface . Strangers , appearing lost , would walk through the neighborhood , the dust and sun 's glare making that place look like somewhere else they were trying to go . Sitting on our porch , I watched people I 'd never seen before walk by seemingly drawn to those rippling pools of heat glistening above the asphalt , as if something must be happening just beyond where that warmth quivered down the street . And at night I 'd look out from the porch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scan the neighborhood , wanting to see some change , something besides the nearby rumble of freight trains and the monotony of heat , something refreshing and new . In heat like that , everyone sat on their porches , looking out into the night and hoping for something better to come up with the sun . <p> It was during such a summer , my mother told me , that my father got home from the third shift at the bottling plant , waked her with his naked body already on top of her , entered her before she was able to say no , sweat on her through moments of whiskey breath and indolent thrusting , came without saying a word , and walked back out of our house forever . He never uttered a word , she said , for it was not his way to speak much when it was hot . <p> My mother told me he left with the rumble of the trains . She was a wise woman and spoke almost as beautifully as she sang . She spoke to me with a smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of someone else , and it was strange to me that she might have wanted to cry at something like that but did n't , as if there were no need anymore . <p> She said she lay still after he left , certain only of his sweat , the work shirt he left behind , and her body calming itself from the silent insistence of his thrusts . She lay still for at least an hour , aware of two things : feeling the semen her body would n't hold slowly leaving her and dripping onto the sheets , and knowing that some part of what her body did hold would fight and form itself into what became me nine months later . <p> I was ten years old when she told me this . After she sat me down and said , This is how you came to me , I knew that I would never feel like I was ten for the rest of that year . She told me what it was to love someone , what it was to make love to someone , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all three do n't happen at once . When she said that , I did n't quite know what it meant , but I felt her need to tell me . She seemed determined not to hold it from me . It seemed as if somehow she was pushing me ahead of my growing . And I felt uncomfortable with it , the way secondhand shoes are at first comfortless . Soon the pain was n't greater , just hard to wear . <p> After that , she filled my home life with lessons , stories , and observations that had a tone of insistence in them , each one told in a way that dared me to let ' it drift from my mind . By the end of my eleventh year , I learned of her sister Alva , who cut off two of her husband 's fingers , one for each of his mistresses . At twelve , I had no misunderstanding , of why , someday soon , for nothing more an a few dollars , I might be stabbed by one of the same boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At thirteen , I came to know that my cousin Dexter had n't become sick and been hospitalized in St. Louis , but had gotten a young white girl pregnant and was rumored to be someone 's yardman in Hyde Park . And when I was fourteen , through the tree-withering heat of August , during the Watertown Blues Festival , in throngs of sweaty , wide-smiling people , my mother pointed out to me my father . <p> For the annual festival , they closed off Eleventh Street from the downtown square all the way up to where the freight railway cuts through the city , where our neighborhood ends and the land rises up to the surrounding hills , dotted with houses the wealthy built to avoid flooding and neighbors with low incomes . Amidst the summer heat was the sizzle of barbecue at every corner , steamy blues from performance stages erected in the many empty lots up and down the street , and , of course , the scores of people , crammed together , wearing the lightest clothing they could without looking loose . By early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blues would have dominion over the crowd . <p> The sad , slow blues songs my mother loved the most . The Watertown Festival was her favorite social event of the year . She had a tight-skinned sort of pride through most days of the year , countered by the softer , bare-shouldered self of the blues festival , where she wore yellow or fiery orange outfits and deep , brownish-red lipstick against the chestnut shine of her cheeks . More men took the time to risk getting to know her , and every year it was a different man ; the summer suitors from past years learned quickly that although she wore that lipstick and although an orange skirt never looked better on another pair of hips , never again would she have a man leave his work shirt hanging on her bedpost . With that kind of poise , she swayed through the crowds of people smiling at many , hugging some , and stopping at times to dance with no one in particular . <p> When I was younger than fourteen , I had no choice but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me shower and put on a fresh cotton shirt . You need to hear the blues , boy , a boy needs something to tell itself what 's good and what 's not . At fourteen , my mother approached me differently . She simply came out to the yard where I was watering her garden and said , You going ? and waited for me to turn to her , and say yes . I did n't know if I liked the blues or not . <p> We started at the top of Eleventh Street and worked our way downtown over the few hours of the festival . We passed neighbors and friends from church , my mother 's boss from Mills Dry Goods , and Reverend Riggins , who was drinking ; beer from a paper cup instead of a can . Midway down Eleventh , in front of Macky 's Mellow Tone Grill , I bumped into my cousin Wilbert , who had sneaked a tallboy of Miller High Life from a cooler somewhere up the street . A Zydeco band was warming up for Etta James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense heat and shared sips of that beer while we watched my mother , with her own beer , swaying with a man twice her age to the zip and smack of the washboard . <p> Etta James had already captured the crowd when Wilbert brought back a large plate of ribs and another beer . My mother came over to share our ribs , and Wilbert was silent after deftly dropping the can of beer behind his back . I stood there listening , taking in the heat , the music , the hint of beer on my mother 's breath . The crowd had a pulse to it , still moving up and down the street but stopping to hear the growl of Etta James 's voice . The sense of closeness was almost too much . My mother was swaying back and forth on her heels , giving a little dip to her pelvis every so often and mouthing the words to the songs . At any given moment , one or two men would be looking at her , seemingly oblivious and lost in the music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closeness of the people . She was looking away from the stage , focusing on a commotion of laughter in front of Macky 's where voices were hooting above the music . She took hold of my shoulders and turned me towards the front of Macky 's . In a circle of loud men , all holding beer , all howling in laughter  --  some shirtless and others in work clothes-stood a large man in a worn gray suit , tugging his tie jokingly like noose , pushing the men into new waves of laughter each moment . His hair was nappy like he had just risen from bed . But he smiled as if that was never his main concern anyway , and he held a presence in that circle of people which made me think he had worn that suit for just such an appearance . My mother held my shoulders tightly for a moment , not tense or angry or anxious , just firm , and then let go . <p> " There 's your father , " she said , and turned away , drifting back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage , I felt obligated not to follow her . When I could see her no longer , I looked back to the circle of men and the man that my mother had pointed out . From the way he was laughing , he looked like a man who did n't care who he might have bothered with his noise . Certainly his friends did n't seem to mind . Their group commanded a large space of sidewalk in front of the bar . People made looping detours into the crowd instead of walking straight through that wide-open circle of drunken activity . The men stamped their feet , hit each other in the arms , and howled as if this afternoon were their own party I turned to tell Wilbert , but he had gone . I watched the man who was my father slapping his friends ' hands , bent over in laughter , sweat soaking his shirt under that suit . <p> He was a very passionate-looking man , large with his laugh , expressively confident in his gestures , and as I watched him , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazy thrust of his which my mother told me had no passion in it at all . I wondered where he must have been all those years and realized how shocked I was to see the real man to fill the image my mother had made . She had made him up for me , but never whole , never fully able to grasp . I was thinking of his silence , the voice I 'd never heard . And wanting nothing else at that moment but to be closer , I walked towards that circle of men . I walked as if I were headed into Macky 's Mellow Tone , and they stopped laughing as I split their gathering . The smell of liquor , cheap cologne , and musky sweat hit my nostrils , and I was immediately aware not only that I had no reason for going or chance of getting into Macky 's , but that <p> was also passing through of a circle of strangers . I stopped a few feet from the entrance and focused on the quilted fake leather covering the door 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at that for what seemed a long time , because I was afraid to turn back into laughter . The men had started talking again , slowly working themselves back into their own good time . But they were n't laughing at me . I turned to face them , and they seemed to have forgotten that I was there . <p> I looked up at my father , who was turned slightly away from me . His mouth was open and primed to laugh , but no sound was coming out . His teeth were large , and I could see where sometime before he had lost two of them . Watching him from the street , I had only seen his mouth move and had to imagine what he was saying . Now , so dose to him , dose enough to smell him , to touch him , I could hear nothing . But I could feel the closeness of the crowd , those unfamiliar men , my father . Then he looked down at me . His mouth dosed , and suddenly he was n't grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as my mother might have told me to do . I arced my hand out to slide across his palm , but he pulled his hand back , smiling  --  a jokester , like he was too slick for my eagerness . <p> He reached in his suit jacket and pulled out a pair of sunglasses . Watertown is a small town , and when he put those glasses on , he looked like he had come from somewhere else . I know I had n't seen him before that day . I wondered when in the past few days he must have drifted into town . On what wave of early morning heat had he arrived ? <p> I looked at myself in the reflection of the mirrored lenses and thought , So this is me . <p> " Them 's slick basketball sneakers you got , " he said . " You a bad brother on the court ? " <p> I could only see the edge of one eye behind those glasses , but <p> decided that he was interested . <p> " Yeah , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just watch . " And I was sure we 'd go inside Macky 's and talk after that . We 'd talk about basketball , and then he 'd ask me if I was doing well in school , and I 'd say not too hot , and he 'd get on me about that as if he 'd always been keeping tabs on me . Then we would toast to something big , something we could share in the loving of it , like Bill Russell 's finger-roll lay-up or the pulled pork sandwich at Round Belly Ribs or the fact that I had grown two inches that year , even though he would n't have known that . We might pause for a moment , both of us quiet , both of us knowing what that silence was about , and he 'd look real serious and anxious at the same time , a man like him having too hard a face to explain anything that had happened or had n't happened . But he 'd be trying . He 'd say , Hey , brother , cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I might say , It 's cool , or I might say nothing at all but know that sometime later on , we would spend hours shooting hoop together up at the rec center , and when I 'd beaten him two out of three at twenty-one , he 'd hug me like he 'd always known what it was like to love me . <p> My father took off his sunglasses and looked down at me for a long silent moment . He was a large man with a square jaw and a wide , shiny forehead , but his skin looked soft  --  a gentle , light brown . My mother must have believed in his eyes . They were gray-blue , calm and yet fierce , like the eyes of kinfolk down in Baton Rouge . His mouth was slightly open ; he was going to speak , and I noticed that his teeth were yellow when I saw him face to face . He would n't stop smiling . A thought struck me right then that he might not know who I was . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's roll , bro , Tyree 's leavin ' ! " <p> He jerked free and threw his friend a look that made me stiffen . <p> The man read his face and then laughed nervously . " Be cool , nigger , break bad someplace else . We got ladies waitin ' . " <p> " I 'm cool , brother . I 'm cool .. I ' My father looked back at me . In the mix of the music and the crowd , which I 'd almost forgotten about , I could barely hear him . " I 'm cold solid He crouched down , wiped his sunglasses on a shirttail , and put them in my pocket . His crouch was close . Close enough for me to smell the liquor on his breath . Enough for him to hug me . Close enough for me to know that he would n't . But I did n't turn away . I told myself that I did n't care that he was not perfect . <p> He rose without saying anything else , turned from me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where his friends were waiting . They were insistent on him hurrying , and once they were sure that he was going to join them , they turned down the alley . I did n't cry , although I would n't have been embarrassed if I had . I watched them leave , and the only thing <p> felt was a wish that my father , on this one day , had never known those men . He started to follow them , but before he left , he stopped to look over the scene there on Eleventh Street . He looked way up the street , to where the crowd thinned out , and then beyond that , maybe to where the city was split by the train tracks , running on a loose curve around our neighborhood to the river ; or maybe not as far as that , just a few blocks before the tracks and two streets off Eleventh where , sometime earlier than fourteen years ago , he might have heard the train 's early morning rumble when he stepped from our back porch . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
