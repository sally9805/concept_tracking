" Sisterhood of the Skin " is Arinn Dembo 's first sale . She attended the Clarion West Writers ' Workshop in 1990 , and has written some science fiction criticism . She 's from Seattle , and has two children . <p> " I wrote ' Sisterhood of the Skin , ' " she writes , " after absorbing a lot of horror stories from people who had worked on fishing boats in Alaska . The life of the merchant seaman is atrociously brutal and dangerous , even in this modern age , and there is little or no legal protection for men and women working in international waters  --  even less protection than there is for the waters themselves . I suppose l was trying to capture my sense of commercial fishing as a continuous state of violence , not only against Nature but against the finer feelings which make us human . " <p> Ones cut a silkie out of the net today ; I came up from the hold to find him trying to kill it on deck with a length of pipe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving him a wide berth ; their eyes were hollow and black in the rain . No one wanted to be too near him . He made a broken , high-pitched sound as he struck , squeals of rage wringing out of him in bursts  --  as if it were him being beaten . <p> It looked like a female . It made no sound , ribs already broken over vital organs but nowhere near death  --  that flesh is too tough , flexible , packed thick onto bones like rock . The breasts were swollen . It may have been nursing a calf , down there somewhere in the black water . The golden pelt was spattered with blood , so red and dark that it seemed almost purple . Its mammalian blood , based on iron but thick as gravy , the veins in those sleek , supple bodies are like drain pipes . <p> For just a second its eyes caught mine . I drew my gun and shot it , erasing the eyes , the winged nostrils , the lion 's mouth , the misery . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like my own . <p> Jones looked up at me , frozen in his simian squat with the bloody pipe still in his hand . He was beyond speech . I had an endless moment to hold the targeting beam on the center of his chest and wonder if it would n't be best to kill him , drop him over the side and try to cut our losses . His eyes were clear , blue , and utterly vacant  --  a berserker . <p> In the end it was simply the fact that I wanted to kill him that decided me against it . I let the barrel of my pistol twitch toward his weapon ; he caught the gesture , looked down stupidly at the bent pipe in his hand , and relaxed his grip for long enough to let it slip out of his fingers and fall to the rusting deckplate with a clatter . He lowered his head and wiped at his mouth , like a man wakened from a nightmare. ; one of the men kicked the pipe away , another touched his shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for what it was worth . <p> " Let 's get this operation back on line before the Captain notices , shall we ? You  --  Gallegos , is it ? Get the rest of your crew together and get that thing down to the lab for me . Do n't drag it , either . I do n't want blood on those stairs . " I looked at Jones . What to do with him ? He was moving slowly , stiff and numb , to pick up his gear . " Jones , good work . That 's a thousand dollar bounty on the silkie , plus the time and a half . You better clock out and spend some time in the hold , or we wo n't be able to afford the bill we 're running up on you . " He rubbed the stiff white bristles at the top of his head with his palm and then nodded , once , in my direction . I watched him go below , his arms swinging dead from the shoulder sockets , like a marionette with half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowsprit far below , boiling away from the prow like surf smashing against the base of a cliff . I went to the rail to smoke a naval cigarette , furtively biting the end to light it . They 're supposed to be pinched alight with your fingernails , but the sparking fluid they dip the paper in is mildly hallucinogemc , much more potent than stale tobacco . A lot of the men do n't bother smoking them at all , just sit around sucking the ends , pleasantly stoned on the spark . <p> On the horizon I saw a silkie leap . Perhaps it was a male ; it 's difficult to say yet whether there are such things as silkie males . I 've had only two specimens on the table so far , the one I shot today and the other that drowned in our deep net , which must have been a calf . There were hints in the immature physiology which are echoed in the adult ; it may be that all the silkies are basically hermaphroditic . It 's only because of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked out over the rain-ragged swells and saw it clear the waves completely , a thick golden are far out over the green-black sea . <p> It leaped over and over , until it became exhausting to watch . That fabulous strength . <p> She was too big to fit easily on the operating table . As the men shoved and dragged the great golden corpse this way and that , trying to get it on the slab , I had to think of Wayland Jones  --  Jones the Younger  --  or rather , the pitiful remnant which I had examined a few weeks ago ; there was nothing left of him but his arm . <p> I 've drawn my pistol twice on this voyage . I had to force Benito " Bunny " Vicarro to shinny out to the end of the bowsprit at gunpoint in order to recover that arms it was frozen to a steel safety rung , and the fingers had to be pried off with a knife . Vicarro cried through the whole operation . I 'm sure he thought it was vengeance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the natural choice . The man is as graceful as a gibbon . <p> Wayland Jones came out on this trip with his father . He 'd never been fishing " off the rock " before  --  that is , off his home planet . I do n't remember much about him , sadly . He shared his father 's terse , powerful genetic code : thick body , heavy arms , bandy legs , mastiff 's jaw . A product of unusually high gravity . He had all of his father 's virtues as a seaman and a fisherman , without the temper so far as I could tell . He also had dark , curly hair  --  a gift from his mother , whoever she may have been . <p> Hazing is the rule on a first voyage . I 'm sure that Jones , Vicarro and Templeton thought nothing of making the poor kid crawl out on the bowsprit to knock off the icicles forming on the gigantic pole  --  without telling him that it would all melt off in seconds if we sent out a burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones Jr . gamely hugged the pylon and bumped his way slowly out over the sea : a hammer in one hand , finding his grip with the other , while the freezing spindle plunged sickeningly over the waves . <p> I was in the foc's'le tower , looking over our satellite photographs of the area , trying to locate the next school of " fish " in the feeding grounds . I saw Jones Jr . when I happened to look out the window ; he had already gone quite a distance from the main body of the ship . He was hugging the transmitter and flailing at the underside with a mallet . <p> I went to the com to tell him to get the hell off before he got himself killed . The waters of this planet are full of fluorocarbons ; they freeze at an extremely low temperature , and even in full gear a man is not likely to survive for more than five minutes overboard  --  also , we were making at least thirty knots , and he might very well have been sucked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the drink . <p> He seemed to see something in the sea beneath him . He lost a toe grip and he was suddenly hanging by one hand from the bowsprit , dangling over the swirling water ; on deck his father and shipmates jumped up and down in silent glee  --  a tribe of victorious chimpanzees dressed in men 's clothes . From the foc's'le I saw what they could not : the pale shape , skimming fast just under the translucent green surface  --  I reached for the controls of the forward ice cannon , but I was much too slow . <p> The silkie reared from the water like a golden-bronze geyser . In the flood lights the men on deck saw it at last , all four meters of the enormous flexing body completely clear of the chop , dancing backward on its tail . . . reaching for young Jones with long , slender flippers open like arms . The monitors did not catch his shriek of terror when its body struck him ; twirling him around on the pivot of his wrist like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapes you only see his open mouth , gaping wide for a soundless scream . <p> It caught him , one limb over his shoulder and the other around his chest  --  it hugged him like a girl leaping on to her lover 's back , wanting him to carry her  --  and sank its muzzle into the muscle layered over his collar bone , tusks shearing through tendons , shattering bones . For a moment , his arm heroically supported them both . The silkie 's weight was so tremendous that the arm ripped free at the shoulder before his grip could weaken enough to drop him into the sea . <p> The elder Jones lunged over and over against the men restraining him , howling , clawing at them ; he would have gone overboard if they had lost hold of him . Several cubic centimeters of thorazine were required before he could be quieted . It was not the best drug for the purpose , but it was handy in the psych cabinet and I had no time for subtleties ; it took six men just to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have liked to try and trace the silkie : not possible Jones distracted me for a few crucial minutes , and this ocean smothers our maximum sonar output within three hundred meters of the ship  --  our loudest shout is lost in the roar of the seismic tide . The Captain belayed my order to submerge the Albatross and search . The silkie took her prey unseen and unhindered down into the dark . <p> I finished my autopsy of the creature sometime during the first shift this morning , rinsed off my isolation gear under a spray of green antiseptic in the lab and then hiked wearily up the narrow iron staircase to my quarters . The suit had to be stripped off piece by piece and dropped into the autoclave , and my skin scrubbed until my body stings all over and I 'm half-boiled  --  still , I feel a fever coming on ; my teeth are already starting to chatter with anaphylactic chills ; there must be elements in that thick blood which can penetrate my skin . The passage of my throat is narrowing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult to breathe . My body is attacking itself  --  and good riddance . <p> I never have wanted this body . I 've applied a dozen times for improvements , been denied every time  --  even the simplest things , like full spectrum eyes . Some of the crew have them . Or a simple immune enhancement ; if I had one I would n't be suffering like this now . My False Counselor always relays the same message : <p> " We 've found that implants are inadvisable in cases like yours , Ms. Tso . These improvements are poorly suited to a personality motivated by feelings of inadequacy . I ca n't recommend the procedure , based on your record . " One does n't have the luxury of hating that placid , smoothly animated face ; the computer is perfect , it can not err . The Counselor program is so realistic that it took me six months to realize that I was n't actually seeing a human therapist  --  a good one . It provided all the encouraging noises and probing questions I 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk , you know I 'm always available . " <p> The hate belongs at home . If you have to hate anything , hate this weak , flabby , fallible shell ; hate the personal failings that have trapped you inside it . <p> At any rate , I ca n't sleep with my breath being squeezed away ; might as well record my impressions of the silkie for future reflection . <p> This was apparently the one that got Jones . I found a naval wristwatch and three old copper coins on a chain  --  a good luck charm !  --  in its digestive tract . These were in one of several secondary stomachs which surround the much larger primary digestive cavity . I ca n't determine the purpose for these subsidiary organs : at first I thought I might have stumbled on a second reproductive system  --  those nine egg-plant shaped stomachs were beribboned with blood vessels and glands , much more suggestive of a uterus than any kind of gastric organ . The presence of Jones ' personal affects seems to suggest that they serve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recovered stones from two of the other stomachs ; these are coated with a thick , nacreous fluid . Do the silkies form pearls in order to protect the delicate alimentary canal ? <p> The intestines are fascinating and also very unusual ; the walls are covered with filaments , which seem to serve a double purpose : they absorb nutrients from digested food ( an ungodly amount of " fish " in the silkie 's gut , in various stages of digestion , they must feed several hours a day ) and they also seem to " feel " the food , palpate it as it passes through the digestive tract . The filaments are loaded with nervous tissue , and the area is incredibly blood rich and sensitive . ( NOTE : An ingestible poison may be the best way to deal with these animals , should they become a serious problem . ) The spinal cord is only inches away from the gut ; the nerve fibers are dense in the area , a thick springy webbing which I was not able to examine in fine detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I killed it may have been a blessing in the end . If there had been a brain intact , I might have spent all my available time examining it , trying to determine its potential intelligence  --  I might not have gotten to the rest of the body at all . The Company xenobiologists would have plumbed the secrets of its carcass in a lab many light years from here . <p> I 'll send a full report to the Captain , along with my recommendations : I do n't think the elder Jones needs to be informed of the silkie 's payload . The man seems to be teetering dangerously ; I 'd hate to think that the revelation would destabilize him further . I 'd like to keep him functioning for another three weeks , until we can bring the load in . It 's the biggest haul on this circuit , our first virgin ocean . Even after three hundred years ( subjective time ) to restock themselves , the fish parks ca n't yield the bounty that we 're taking now ; four cubic miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brimming every week . . . A world never yields its maidenhead twice . <p> * * * <p> Woke up after the first shift when my fever broke . Still weak . I ca n't face the Captain ; I 've logged my report . <p> I dreamed of my father . I saw his face , the two paradoxical halves of it ; I was sitting on his lap , very small  --  small enough again to touch his hard cheek , to polish his glowing golden eye , and feel its heat through a chamois cloth . His flesh eye never seemed as human or real as the other ; it was nothing but a sad brown relic . Just so , his flesh hand never seemed as gentle or skilled as the cybernetic one . <p> My mother was in the dream as well . <p> My father came to us in the hogan . He walked in without speaking and sat heavily at the table ; the chair croaked under him like an old woman carrying a load of firewood . He opened his battered pectoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candy showered onto the tabletop . He looked down on me , his daughter , and smiled . <p> Mother stood by the stove , wrapped in blankets and ropes of silver . She was a wealthy woman who married outside her own tribe ; my father was a half-breed Lakota before he became a god of destruction . She poured out a bowl of blue corn mush and set it down in front of him , her lips pressed tight . He looked down at the bowl and suddenly went still , shut off like an automaton . <p> It was too much for her . She went to the comer and bent to pick up his portable generator , because he did n't have a saddle and she had to throw something out the door ; I found out later that this is what the women on the reservation do to declare a divorce . He slept , sitting upright at the table with his head bent slightly , as if he were studying his scorched armor . His chest did not move as he breathed . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its weight , while I sat eating my candies two at a time , heedless of the flavors mishmashed in my mouth . . . afraid she would take them away from me . My mother grunted , freeing one hand to open the screen door . She threw the generator out into the red dusty yard . It exploded in a shower of sparks as it hit the ground , and my father snapped upright in his chair , his movement so swift and well-oiled that it could never be mistaken for human . <p> I do n't think he even recognized her . She had cut off his power when he was weak and exhausted ; she was a threat . He fired two scissoring beams which plunged into her belly and chest , and she burst into a hot , stinging cloud of superheated red steam . Her four limbs were lost in four directions , and I lay on the kitchen floor , burned and crying  --  her blood was so hot . <p> He had great difficulty remembering sometimes who the enemy was . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden eye trained on me , sights open . I begged him not to shoot , calling him Poppy the way I did when I was four ; he went back to bed , shaking his head slowly from side to side . It took weeks sometimes before the Company repaired the damage to his brain . <p> They separated us after my " incident . " Better for both of us , they said . <p> Things on deck look good . I 've brought miso to the foc's'le and the mid shift reports a school in the nets . There are men on the winches , easing the deep net into the hold to let the seawater drain . I 've assigned a few dozen slimers to a watch on deck and on the sonar ; I do n't want to lose any more chances at a silkie . The women seem grateful for a break from cleaning fish . The machinery can handle it for a few hours ; the humans are really only there to maintain standards of quality . <p> Fascinating creatures , these silkies  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted them along with our prey . They would n't have sent us here if there were any visible Samoans . Bad policy . <p> This planet is sometimes very beautiful . If only there were any land , someone would colonize it ; the waters are loaded with life . Inuit or Norwegian settlers would do well . I can imagine their hide boats on the water , slipping easily over these beds of vegetation where the Albatross can not venture  --  curachs and kayaks following that trail of twisting green fire which dances on the skin of the sea . They would hunt the silkie as they hunted the orca , with bone-tipped spears . <p> Lost another man . Still not sure how . Gunther Jones is being held accountable at the moment . <p> Sometime during first shift today , the crew went in to gas the drained catch in the hold . Simple enough procedure ; we 've done it a dozen times . The fish are too strong to be gutted live ; they have teeth sharp enough and jaws strong enough to snap off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are susceptible to ethylene gas , which is generally harmless to the men , once it disperses ; it asphyxiates the fish within minutes and dissipates quickly enough that they can be processed and packed without danger of spoilage . The crew goes through the job in about twenty minutes , firing their gas hoses into the net . <p> They claim that this time , the fish fired back . <p> I 've watched the tapes , I attended the interrogations . . . the officers scoured the hold with everything but an electron microscope . There was no weapon . No perpetrator . No fish , either ; the net was unmoored in the fracas and dropped back into the ocean . Half a million dollars rained back into the soup and swam as fast as fins could carry them to the deepest , blackest crevasse in the sea . It reflects on us , not the cyborg officers ; despite their general disinterest in shipboard affairs , the Company holds them to be infallible . <p> The tapes , as usual , are useless . Nothing but gouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ethylene canisters howling out their contents without hands to control the flow , men screaming , James Freedman burning . It was obviously a nasty little T-rod that did the job , the sort of laser mining torch that sailors can buy in any port in the system  --  nastier than most . I 've got a man laid out in my lab who 's missing most of the left side of his body . Your average black market laser ca n't generate that kind of power . <p> It does n't matter . Jones has gone insane . He must have dropped his weapon into the water after firing it at Freedman  --  or perhaps , much less likely , after firing at a man standing on the other side of the hold . The walls are polished steel ; it 's not strictly impossible that they could have reflected the energy , some kind of ricochet effect . Jones was standing one man over from Freedman at the time . This is the current consensus : the beams coming out of the net would be just an illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense can be extracted from Jones at all . After the last frenzied assertion that someone in the net was shooting at him , I put him down . His constitution is such that no tranquilizer will hold for long ; it may be more economical to put him back into suspension for the duration of the trip . Of course , the extra time will partially drain his tank , but it 's more than possible to transfer him to his son 's berth for the journey home . Or Freedman 's , for that matter . <p> We 're behind , thanks to this appalling accident . We 'll have to bring in another load before we can climb the well and get off this spinning ball of slush , and then take the short way home in order to make it in on schedule . The cargo is already promised to half a dozen hungry worlds . If we do n't deliver , I can say goodbye to any chance of leaving this kind of duty ; for that matter , I might pull worse . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth  --  an officer , despite the fact that I 'm all meat and no metal . <p> I 'll take the obligatory look at Freedman , although I 'm sure there is n't anything else to find . I 'm getting very tired . <p> A man crossed himself before obeying my orders . Such a familiar gesture that I stood gaping at him for a few seconds , while he eyed me sidelong his eyes long dark , dubious . The gesture was so pervasive throughout my childhood and youth that seeing it ripped me out of time : Spanish women crossing themselves at my father and me as we ate ice cream in front of the Palace of the Governors . For a moment , I felt what my father must have felt ; contempt , indifference , shock . Shame under it all , the nagging shame of one who has surpassed the species in some grotesque way . <p> There are n't enough places to lay out cadavers in this scabby little kitchenette/laboratory . The silkie occupies the operating table , Freedman 's body I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only need the one side anyway . Jones is still in the tank , and there should n't be any need to lay him out anywhere , if he 'll just cooperate . The tank is unwieldy , blocks the door to the lab , who cares ? A crowded little den of science . <p> Damned glad I managed to get a bead on this silkie when she cleared the water . Of course , I was only being professional ; I did n't think I 'd hit her , but I knew I would n't get another shot at her . That 's the second time I 've been lucky . It 's statistically unrealistic to expect t he luck I 'll need to get away with this  --  these investigations of mine are pure indulgence . I should be carving up fish , not hunting mermaids . <p> She does n't look much like a silkie now . The flippers have become articulated into five digits , one of which looks distinctly opposable . Coincidence ? Impossible . The bones are much more plastic than previously ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in contrast to the first adult Jones brought in ; she had bones like granite . The skull is also softened , unknitted ; it has to be . The thing was growing a new face . I ca n't imagine how it was happening but I intend to find out . <p> I questioned Jones before he was fully awakened from his deep sleep , still lying half-buried in the shining shock get of the suspension tank . He stirred feebly as I wiped the cold jelly from his face and peeled away the mask so that he could pull his own oxygen . <p> " Hello , Gunther . Can you hear me ? " <p> Jones blinked his eyes , slowly and rhythmically . It took me a moment to realize that there must be a film of the jelly coating his corneas ; perfectly clear , but it would distort his vision . He opened his mouth , sticky threads stretching between his parted lips , and drew in a rattling breath . I had to lean close to catch his word . <p> " Dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did look dead ; worse , hideously resurrected . It was not pleasant to be reminded . <p> " Am I dead . " <p> His barrel chest seemed to buckle ; his shoulders folded together and he sank deeper into the tank . I caught his chin and held his face out of the glistening ooze , not wanting him to drown . <p> " You 're not dead , Gunther . " It took some doing , but I kept my grip on his jaw and pulled him further from the tank without actually having to immerse my hands . The suspension medium is perfectly inert and harmless , but very unpleasant to the touch when chilled . <p> His eyes rolled up in their sockets , leaving nothing but the sickly blue-white sclera staring out of the parted lids , and he began to speak poetry . I believe the first word was a man 's name : Norm , or perhaps Norms . The language was old , some gutteral , wet Scandinavian tongue . <p> Jones opened his eyes again ; he seemed to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not awakened from his psychotic nightmare . " Oh , he 's dead , all right . I 've seen you . You and your metal men . Dragon 's teeth in the water . " His lips pulled back from his teeth and he began a mnemonic exercise , one of the simplest , which fishermen are often taught to help control their panic responses when they lie in the suspension tank , waiting to lose consciousneess . It was the one which begins : <p> " I rowed and rowed until I knowed there was n't no more to row , For I 'd come to the place where the water and waves turn into the ice and snow . . . " <p> * * * <p> " Gunther , did you see Wayland in the net ? " <p> He looked at me , cut off in mid-verse . His mouth moved very slowly into the most malicious smile I have ever seen . <p> " Was he there , Gunther ? Did you see him ? " <p> "  --  It was all very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He continued to recite it until I turned down the temperature of the suspension and pulled the mask back over his stiffening face . It 's useless to try to extract information from the man . His mind is broken and I do not have the professional skills or equipment to mend it . <p> It 's a shame , really . I wanted to know whether he had seen his son bite off James Freedman 's arm . <p> Apparently my assumption about the last silkie was incorrect . This one was carrying many small bones in her gastric pouches , all of them recognizably human : a few carpal bones , metacarpi , and the terminal digits of a human hand . There almost seem to be too many of them , even given my previous hypothesis that a silkie in the net succeeded in biting off Freedman 's arm when he was killed . The bones were coated in a shimmering calcium secretion , which is very similar in nature to a terrestrial mollusk 's  --  spectrographic analysis reveals nothing more unusual than a few skeins of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom . It looks very much like mother-of-pearl , although the dominant colors seem to be yellow and red . There must be infinite variation from silkie to silkie . <p> I could spend days dissecting one of these ladies , but there were important matters at hand . I unceremoniously ripped apart her head , examining the contents with my microscopes and spectrometer ; eventually the tissues were nothing but a blurry , garish soup which I stirred with black pipettes , and I forgot from moment to moment what it was I had been looking for . <p> The muscles are blood-rich and full of organic compounds , aldehydes , ketones and lactic acid . The silkie must have been using them to fuel its transformation . Opening the skin was remarkably easy ; she had lost many layers of dense subcutaneous fat , which made her pelt hang like a loose robe . I had to gather up a fistful of it and pull it almost half a meter away from the solid flesh beneath to make a neat incision . <p> I cut the savage golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulleys which bound her skull , the face of Wayland Jones was beneath it . The likeness to a human was so startling that the scalpel dropped from my hand and I had to turn away for several moments , holding my own face in my hands  --  as if I had suddenly thrown back a coffin lid , squatting in the bottom of a rudely opened grave , and found that the occupant was my own brother . <p> Only the huge , dark eyes had not changed , all pupil but for a rim of muddy brown-black . The orbital ridge was so flexible that I could depress it with my finger , and the upward curve of the cranium was no longer so sleek and dynamically sloped as it must have been before ; the curving forehead suggested a more developed cerebral cortex , and the bone of the pate was wobbly , almost cartilaginous . I found the new neural growths forming over the old , folded tight just above the structure which is so like a mammalian limbic system . They looked like buds , densely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the petals of a mum . <p> Gallegos finally distracted me from my investigation some time during my fourth consecutive shift in the lab . I did not hear him come in . <p> " Madre de Dios , " he said . <p> I looked up from the roaring centrifuge and into his wide , staring eyes . I watched , detached , as his face crumpled from shock and disbelieving horror to intense dismay , grief , fear  --  and a narrow-eyed , shifting look of guilt . <p> " Way ? " he asked , pointing with a finger which he held close to his own chest , as if afraid the corpse would snap at it . <p> I stared at him , unable to understand him , for what seemed like several minutes . He offered nothing more , only stood looking at me , obviously waiting for an answer , while the gears in my brain ground slowly , trying to process that one enigmatic syllable . A silent , glazed eternity , two faces as blank as bowls of milk locked in a contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way . . . land Jones ? No . . .

" <p> Gallegos crossed himself with one hand and used the other to yank a tarp over the glistening peeled face of his shipmate . His lips pulled back in a grimace . " It needs to be covered . A la Verga . . . It needs to be buried . " <p> Sharp , naked fear washed over my skin . He was right , of course  --  in a manner of speaking . Gallegos was willing to believe that I 'd removed this head from the silkie 's stomach , but anyone could have entered the lab during my autopsies and seen the thing  --  the men are coming in constantly with cuts , colds , fevers ; in my delirium , the reaction that they would have to this spectacle had never entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I looked up at Gallegos and let him read my face  --  the man is quite literate in the language of expression and gesture , for all he signs his name with a leering devil glyph . He looked away , tense and awkward . <p> " I 'll be needing a few men from your crew , sailor . Send them down in an hour . " I looked down at the corpse . " I 'll be finished by then . " <p> " Aye . " He turned and left , rubbing the back of his neck fiercely with one hand as I started up the bone saw . <p> I had an extremely strong allergic reaction to the silkie 's blood ; my fever has broken now , but I 've been burning for the past several hours . Had strange dreams . <p> I was holding a tremendous bowl in my arms , filled to the brim with pearls  --  pearls as big as a naked skull lay half-buried in seed pearls no bigger than drops of honey . A brown woman stood running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white sand trickle through her long , slender fingers . <p> She hefted the biggest pearl in two hands and dropped it into a goblet of wine . The cup seemed small , but it grew as big as a vat to receive the pearl . Thick , dark red slopped over the sides and onto her dress ; I smelled hot iron and salt . I dropped my bowl ; pearls spilled over my bare feet , and the ground split opens water gushed from the floor , achingly cold . She offered me the edge of her goblet , which she was somehow still able to hold ; her hand was gigantic , golden . <p> " Drink , Beloved , " she said , " and you will be transformed . " I looked down into the cup , and everything was obliterated but the red reflection of my own face . The red fluid was not wine . It had never been wine . It was silkie 's blood , red-violet silkie 's blood , with threads of the great pearl in it . A cloud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like milk in a cup of tea .

Blood ran down from the comers of her mouth as she lifted her head . <p> She put a hand behind my neck and drew me in for a kiss ; as our lips met she pushed smaller pearls out of her mouth with her tongue , forcing them into mine . <p> I swallowed them . <p> I had other dreams , some even more confusing some more painful . I dreamed of my " incident " again  --  it happens often enough when I 'm in good health , much more so when I 'm sick or over-tired . I 've learned how to wake myself up instantly if the dream begins , hauling myself out by the scruff of the neck the moment I see the signs  --  that light buzzing above the bathroom mirror , my own trembling rust-brown hands in front of my face . This time , I could n't free myself ; I was too weak to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while I watched it all again . <p> It was the final dose of mnemonic booster that did it , combined with the stimulants I had taken on my third morning without sleep ; I was trying to study for my mid-term exams in quantum mechanics . I saw metallic flashes in the corners of my eyes ; I became convinced that my eye sockets were made of metal . If I could only peel off this layer of covering flesh , the rubber mask of brown woman-face , I would find my true face beneath it , gleaming ; I could recover my birthright , clean away the blood and polish my own eye with a chamois cloth . <p> The bathroom , the white basin , the razors my Polynesian roommate used to maintain ritual scars on her arms and thighs . I picked one up , holding the little ceramic wafer awkwardly between my fingers , and made an incision at the hairline . <p> I watched this for the hundredth time , my own hands working to peel away my brow . In reality there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , red again , an Indian girl down to the marrow of my bones . In my dream , I pulled it all away easily , staring at the steely beauty beneath , my jaw elegantly hinged and socketed . I was delighted , and yet somehow I kept pulling at myself , and the steel came away in pieces , like the peel of a strange metal fruit . <p> Underneath it all was a silkie 's face . She opened her lion 's mouth , her soft brown eyes shining . The lips pulled back to reveal her black tusks and purplish gums ; she was smiling at me . <p> " Mother , " I said , and at last pulled free of the dream . The Captain 's face hovered above mine , gleaming like a steel moon . I looked up into the silver eyes of his hologram , and made some effort to compose my own features . <p> " Report to the bridge in one hour . " <p> The officers ' quarters are much larger than those assigned to human crew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform ; a chair had been placed on the platform for me , facing the eight central screens . <p> " Mister Tso , please sit . " The Captain and his staff hung in the rungs and struts all around me , each of them bigger than my cabin . Steam rose from the dripping , trembling hulk of the First Mate  --  he squatted below me on a dais , all sixteen legs splayed out to dry . <p> " I would prefer to stand , sir . " Gallegos had betrayed me to them , surely ; I was prepared for discipline . <p> " Mister Guon has made several sweeps outside the ship since you submitted your last report on the native predators . He discovered a group of them at the furthest edge of his patrol and recorded their behavior from a distance . We can not classify the footage . Respectfully request your opinion . " <p> I turned away from them and sat , fighting to control the sudden weakness of relief which swept my body . " It would be my pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The curving screen shimmered into a huge curtain of sensuous blue-green , so filled with light that the film could not have been shot more than twenty meters from the surface . Silkies materialized in the softly glowing water , arching their backs . Even at full speed they would have been swimming slowly , gently looping over and over in the water . They swam together , brushing flippers and flukes : I did n't realize until they separated that one of them was partially humaniform  --  the flippers bent at an unnatural angle when she reached for the others . <p> I froze . " One of them seems to be injured , " I said . My chest was tight , constricted  --  I could hardly breathe . It was ghastly to have to lie to them ; but I was suddenly certain of what I was about to see , and the need to protect the silkies was uncontrollable . Tears filled my eyes ; I 've never been in such conflict before . " Perhaps the others are providing aid or comfort . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be , yes . But this is certainly not conclusive . " <p> " Continue watching . " <p> Other silkies were dimly visible beyond them , pale and dark circling together in the blue gloom . The group separated and swam one after the other , spiraling down into deeper water . The humaniform silkie rolled over and hung nose down in the water , while the others nuzzled at her flukes and the curve of her anterior surface . <p> " We found these gestures curious . " <p> I knew what was coming they swam past her one by one and kissed her , rooting in her muzzle for the pearls . I took a deep breath , turned to the council of titans behind me , and lied again  --  hoping they would mistake the changes in my vital signs as stress and amazement . " These patterns are similar to others I 've studied . A high probability of sentience . They must be Samoans , and we 've already murdered three of them  --  God only knows how many will starve . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its circling forum . " The scoop will have to be aborted . " <p> The Captain and his staff sat in silent communion , exchanging frequencies beyond my hearing . At last he spoke : " I concur . We will climb the well at O-eight hundred hours . Please prepare the crew for flight . All scoop operations will be shut down immediately . " <p> I had very little trouble making my escape . <p> I loaded Jones myself into a new berth for the trip home . The crew was more than willing to hit the tanks ; it was the work of two hours to prepare them for the long sojourn shock jelly and double check their life support systems . There are only fifty-three humans aboard the Albatross , most of them second or third generation fishermen . Getting into a suspension tank is as easy as pulling a blanket over themselves . <p> I made my own preparations at dawn . I unbolted one of the portside ice cannons and loaded it onto Launch Sixty-three , The Red Shoes , along with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sampling sea life in a variety of conditions ; the generator will continue providing power and heat long after I 'm dead of old age . It will still be running when the next ship comes , if it comes  --  three hundred years from now , or a thousand . <p> The timing of the drop was delicate . I could n't give the Captain any time to abort the launch and retrieve me , so I had to eject during the actual lift-off  --  wear and tear on the drive mechanism , waste of fuel is worth more than the launch and any ten of the cyborg officers , much less a human one  --  but <p> I also had to be free of the Albatross and the heavy seas she would cause when she cleared the water . The bed Shoes has her own static envelope , but nothing would prevent my body being pulped if she tumbled end over end in a tidal wave . <p> In the end I jettisoned the boat at about t-minus three minutes and opened up the engines full bore for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about three hundred km/hour . I submerged to fifty meters and gunned the rotors to fight the turbulence ; it was milder than expected . The Albatross lifted off on time . My little boat shivered in her inertial bubble and wafted through the sea , trembling under the impact of the violent tides . <p> To you , the someday reader of this journal , to you I offer this explanation of my acts : <p> All of my life I have been in exile in my own body , forced to live in a stranger 's house . Begging , pleading , straggling availed me nothing ; I remained a nubbin of helpless flesh surrounded by machines  --  an insect scurrying among metal giants . To thrive I needed a titanium shell to cover my nakedness ; this was not allowed  --  if anything , because I wanted it too badly . <p> The silkies are not so judgmental . My hands still feel strangely soft ; I put on gloves last night to counter the effects of the silkie 's blood on my own physiology : Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry an appropriate DNA pattern , my own body does n't know what to do with itself . My carpal bones have softened somewhat in readiness for change - they may firm again by the time I 've determined how difficult it will be to achieve my transformation . <p> The pearls are the primary form of communication among silkies . If they had a song , it could n't be heard for long distances , and their numbers are small . They developed a language which they could swallow and pass along ; a language which prevents them from being out-adapted by any other organism ; any feature which gives an advantage can be absorbed . The story of man 's advent is spreading , illustrated among them by blossoming brains and branching flippers . <p> They seem quite capable of using weapons , given the digits to manipulate them ; Freedman was almost certainly shot by the same silkie which ate Jones . She must have been caught in the net with the fish  --  armed with Jones 's intellect , Jones 's opposable thumb , Jones 's weapon  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; whatever they can swallow , they can become . The DNA sampling kit I have on board should be quite interesting to them . <p> A pod of silkies approached the boat today . I went out on deck to face them . I 've killed and dissected them with my own hands , and I knew perfectly well how serious a threat to my personal safety they could be  --  but my reincarnation can never succeed without them , and I think they know what I 'm trying to do . They dove and leaped all around The Red Shoes for over an hour , caressing the hull and peering through the observation ports . At last one of them surged up on the starboard side and caught the rail in her gigantic hands ; the ship listed heavily to one side until the envelope was able to compensate for her tremendous weight . She threw one elbow  --  an articulated elbow !  --  over the icy rail and held out the other hand to me ; her outstretched fingers were easily long and thick enough to wrap around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pearl . <p> Among my own people I was nothing , trapped on the receding shore of evolution . Here , I am the matriarch of a new race . There are always silkies alongside my ship , listening to my voice , to the hum of my engine ; they seem to come and go in shifts . I think they 've been driving fish into my net . Sometimes they trade pearls with me ; if I use the saw , I can easily cut the pearls in half , insert a slip of biomass and return it . I 've seen the thickening of a larynx here and there ; in my dreams , I hear them singing . . . and although the sound is strange , I know that every voice is my own . <p> The day will come when I am able to slide naked into the sea , and swim among my new people as one of their number . I will shed this body and grow strong , golden , a ring of rippling muscle and bones like rock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these waters again - men will not find them helpless to defend the schools which feed them , the precious pearls of transformation for which Homo sapiens would gladly slaughter them . I give them what they need . When tales of me are passed from mouth to mouth , they will call me The Changing Woman . When men and machines are dragged screaming down m to the depths , it will be in my name . <p> I will make them ready , my sisters , my children , my people . Meet us as equals , stranger  --  or do not venture into the sea . <p> <p> By Arinn Dembo <p>
