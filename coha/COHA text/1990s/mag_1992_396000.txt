In the era of mass communication , the television commercial has become the principal form of political speech . Citizens who once saw their candidates behind podiums or on railroad cars now see them in cleverly edited 30-second television spots accompanied by uplifting music and a soothing voice-over . From Lyndon Johnson 's " Daisy " to George Bush 's " Willie Horton , " political ad makers have shown their genius for discovering the electorate 's emotional undercurrents . The advertisers who make the right guesses about the hopes and fears that sway the public mind lead their candidate to victory . The 1992 presidential campaign offers two candidates toward whom the American public feels deep ambivalence , which means that the election will most likely turn on perceptions of character rather than on questions of government . The prize will go to the candidate who presents himself in the fairest light and his opponent in the darkest shadow . The work of casting smoke and lights is the work of the media consultant , and with the hope of teaching its readers a few tricks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design commercials for Bush and Clinton and explore the advertising strategies of a presidential campaign . The following forum is based on a discussion held at the Canterbury Hotel in Washington , D.C. , in April . Robert S. Boynton and Paul Tough served as moderators . ROBERT S. BOYNTON is senior editor of Harper 's Magazine . PAUL TOUGH is an associate editor of Harper 's Magazine . REPUBLICANS STUART STEVENS is the director of the Stuart Stevens Group . In 1990 he was a media consultant to William Weld 's gubernatorial campaign in Massachusetts . He occasionally writes for the CBS TV program Northern Exposure . IAN WEINSCHEL is the president of River Bank , Inc . He and his wife , Betsy , were media-strategy consultants for Pat Buchanan this year . PAUL WILSON is the president of Wilson Communications . He produced ads for Gerald Ford 's presidential campaign in 1976 and Howard Baker 's in 1980 . DEMOCRATS CARTER ESKEW is a partner at Squier/Eskew/Knapp/Ochs Communications . He produced ads for Jim Florio 's 1990 gubernatorial campaign in New Jersey . KEN SWOPE is the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced ads for Tom Harkin 's presidential campaign this year and Michael Dukakis 's primary campaign in 1988 . JOE TRIPPI is a partner at Trippi , McMahon &; Squire . He produced ads for Jerry Brown 's presidential campaign this year . THE REPUBLICANS LOOK FOR WONDER YEARS RESONANCE ROBERT BOYNTON : It 's Labor Day , and George Bush is the Republican nominee for president . As his campaign manager , I have gathered you , my media consultants , to help me plan our advertising strategy for the general campaign against the Democratic nominee , Bill Clinton . The political season has just begun in earnest . It 's time to put out our first ad . This is the ad that 's going to give the public its first post-primary , post-convention sense of George Bush . What do we do ? STUART STEVENS : We have to show that the extraordinary change that has taken place all over the world is relevant to Americans ' everyday lives . So my first spot would open with the famous " duck and cover " film , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show schoolchildren what to do in case of nuclear war . This will have a sort of Wonder Years resonance with the baby boomers , who are the real battleground in this election : Clinton has to win them or else he 's dead . The first half of the ad would be in black and white , and in the second half I 'd go to color and use contemporary shots  --  footage of the Berlin Wall coming down and of American troops coming home from Europe . The second half would be about how a generation of kids wo n't have to fear nuclear war . The first shot would be of the " duck and cover " stuff playing on a vintage television , and the last part would be contemporary scenes on a much more modern set , some sleek television . It would be a 60-second spot . I would do it  --  and all of the Bush ads  --  with a hand-held camera . That gives it a more documentary feel . BOYNTON : Why ? STEVENS : Bush 's problem is that when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas if you put him out in the open , everyone 's always struck by what a big , athletic guy he is . To capture that we need to go hand-held , maybe even use a 16-mm camera for a grittier feel . We need to make him as alive as possible , as real as possible . BOYNTON : So you 'd get him in crowds ? STEVENS : Well , I 'm very leery of that kind of shot , because it just screams " Politician ! " That is exactly what Bill Clinton is  --  he 's the quintessential political mutation ; it 's like they constructed him in a lab . All this guy has done is run for office . We must distinguish Bush from that image . The most successful stuff that was done with Bush in 1988 was stuff shot up at Kennebunkport with his family . I 'd do variations of that with small groups . BOYNTON : What kind of music should we use ? STEVENS : I 'd open with period music from the early Sixties  --  whatever the number-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television would be crucial  --  along with the music  --  in defining the period . The image of the television will also help the spot 's general credibility , because people believe something when they see it on television . TV is our window on the world . BOYNTON : How do you convey the ad 's message other than with the visuals ? Do you have a voice-over ? STEVENS : Yeah . We need a voice-over , but it wo n't say much . Maybe twenty seconds of voice-over . The ad will work because of the images . BOYNTON : What kind of voice-over would it be ? STEVENS : I 'd use this guy that was used a lot in the last Bush campaign . He has the voice of God , if you think of God as a benevolent preacher . And the combined message of the visuals and the soothing voice would be : " It 's safe now . And George Bush made it that way . " If we can establish our credibility on that one point , we 've got our base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our other messages . It 's crazy for Bush not to use foreign policy  --  the area where he has had the most success and the thing he truly cares about  --  just because people are concerned about the economy . We must dictate the terms of the campaign . BOYNTON : Do you put the candidate in the ad or is it all just footage ? STEVENS : There is very little Bush , probably just in the last ten seconds . BOYNTON : A still picture of him ? STEVENS : No . We should never use Bush in a still . God , he looks so wooden when he 's not moving ! I would shoot Bush very , very tightly . People say , " But he looks tired . " That 's okay . People do n't mind if the President looks tired  --  it means he 's working . I 'd make sure the spot has a gritty , rustic look . The more vulnerable Bush looks , curiously , the more real and appealing he is . BOYNTON : Is Bush in a suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't put him in a Red Sox sweatshirt , but I 'd give him something you 'd believe he would wear . PAUL WILSON : I 'd take a different approach . I would n't start so far back in the past . It 's very hard to jerk people back in time  --  it 's much better to work with what you have . And I would n't give up the economy issue . Instead , I would use the images and metaphors of our successes and pair them with our weaknesses . I would intersperse shots of the Berlin Wall , even Panama and Desert Storm , with positive news about the economy . My spot would be elaborate and probably quite expensive , but it would dramatize the tremendous changes that have taken place . The metaphor for the spot  --  the central image  --  would be a tall ship in the ocean , a re-enactment of Columbus discovering America . The idea would be that Bush is setting our course in a new direction , with as much significance as the very discovery of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ship throughout the shots . You 'd have long , glorious shots of the ship cutting through the waves , and next to that I would juxtapose a guy in a house under construction saying , " Housing starts are up 6.5 percent . " Then right after showing Desert Storm footage I would have a farmer from the Midwest saying , " We 're shipping more grain than ever before " or " We 've seen an explosion in our exports . " I 'd take what we like about Bush and pair it with a selective account of what we are uneasy with  --  the economy . BOYNTON : What if housing starts are n't up 6.5 percent ? Do we lie ? WILSON : They will be somewhere , during some period . That 's why we have a research department . BOYNTON : In this ad , is the sea stormy ? WILSON : No . It 's a gorgeous shot of the ship , but it 's not overdone . You might see twenty seconds of the ship . I 'm using Columbus as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to say that we are pointed in the right direction . You also have the analogy of the captain , of somebody in charge who makes things happen , but that would be left to the viewer to supply . The point of this is to start with something that 's bigger than life , because the presidency is bigger than life . I would do the whole spot with a Steadicam so it looks smooth and seamless to counteract the herky-jerky movements associated with Bush . Unlike Clinton , Bush needs all the smoothness he can get . BOYNTON : Would you have music in the background ? Is there a voice-over ? WILSON : It would be original music . Something that conveys a sense of newness . Lots of horns . And you have the voice saying : " We 're headed in the right direction . It is a new direction , but it is the right one . " And under the narrator 's voice I 'd drop 4-to 5-second snippits from the State of the Union address and people talking to us about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your first spot ? IAN WEINSCHEL : I would open with Desert Storm footage , rescues in helicopters and war footage , to a soundtrack that was something like Top Gun  --  very uplifting music , very dramatic . Then I would segue into another section over which the President 's voice would be saying something like , " What we 've been able to accomplish in the world we now have to harness back here in this country . We need to take the kind of leadership we had in Desert Storm and bring it home and make America first again . " And then , to give it some credibility , I would put in a couple of very specific issues , like term limits . I would use the President 's voice and put in an echo to make it inspirational . I 'd let Bush do the comparison about how the world has changed . I 'd use that patriotic inspiration and bring people together , which is what a president can do . BOYNTON : Do you show the President ? WEINSCHEL : I 'd show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes . It 's almost like Reagan 's old " Morning Again in America " spot , but with more of the President mixed into it  --  rolled-up shirtsleeves , with people , not large crowds , doing physical things . You 'd put him in crowds of ten or fifteen people , working with them , whether they 're dockworkers , people in high-tech industries , in assembly plants . I would surround him with women in some shots too . STEVENS : I think Desert Storm is the wrong way to go . If this campaign is a referendum on Desert Storm , the Democrats can start picking out their offices in the White House . It will be a disaster . The war has very short coattails and is Bush 's most obvious achievement , so it 's wrong to overplay it . Also , these ads wo n't work if they look like political ads . That 's why I want to do stuff that has n't been done , like hand-held shots . These ads have to break from the stiff , formal tradition of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts out to sell its goods . THE DEMOCRATS LOOK FOR THE BIG IDEA PAUL TOUGH : I 'm Bill Clinton 's campaign manager and I want to plan our first ad . We 're behind in the polls , and there is a big segment of the American population that distrusts our candidate . So I want our first ad to convince those people that Clinton is not a bad guy . KEN SWOPE : I disagree with your strategy . TOUGH : What am I doing wrong ? SWOPE : We 've got to start off on the attack . I worked for Dukakis in 1988 and saw what happens when you do n't go negative . Presidential politics is like nuclear war : he who strikes first wins . There are sixty days until the election : I 'd do an attack ad every four days and let it play on the news so that Bush has to respond . We 've got to use things against Bush that are worse on a personal level than anything Bush has on Clinton . Then people will say to themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Bush , Bill Clinton is wonderful . " TOUGH : Joe , do you think we can win if we just convince the voters that Bush is even worse than Clinton ? Or do you think we need to build up Clinton ? JOE TRIPPI : The country does n't particularly like either one of them , but it 's our guy they do n't trust . And if it 's a choice between a guy they do n't trust and a guy they do n't like , we 'll end up losing . We 've got to define this race vis-a-vis Bush , vis-a-vis the economy and the need for drastic change . But we also need something that defines Clinton in a positive fashion . Our negative track should be a spot that juxtaposes foreign policy issues and economic problems . We ca n't just hand the Republicans a foreign-policy advantage . We have to put them on the defensive right away with a barrage of attacks , but do it with four or five different spots , each tailored to a specific region of the country : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills shutting down . We show people the problems in their region , show them shots of how the world has changed , and ask them why their lives are going down the toilet . TOUGH : Those are attack ads . Ca n't I make a positive ad off the top ? CARTER ESKEW : I think we can . To the extent that people distinguish issues from character , I would want to open with an issue ad . We have to confront the incredible cynicism with which people view ads these days . If we spend lots of money producing beautiful ads , like Paul Wilson 's tall ships , people are going to look at them and say they 're all bullshit . The American public has become an extremely sophisticated audience for commercials . I guarantee that in three years people in focus groups will be saying , " That 's a Ken Swope ad . " " That 's a Stuart Stevens  --  he likes to use hand-held . " " That 's Paul Wilson because he has wonderful ships . " The curtain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind it . Frankly , I think what you say is a hell of a lot more important than how you say it . If you look at the Clinton campaign in the primaries , the ad that worked best for him was his opening ad in New Hampshire where he said , " Call for my plan . " People actually called . That was about information . The other thing that worked was his half-hour ad , which was a longer format that let people see him relating to people in a more " real " way , which he is pretty good at . Clinton 's problem is that he is so good on camera that it reinforces his whole " Slick Willie " problem . It 's ironic : for years we 've craved a candidate who could talk , and now we have a guy who 's almost too good . We have to first get a couple of big ideas for the country , and then run spots that explain them . " As president , I will do three things : I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut the defense budget by 50 percent instead of 30 percent , and I 'm going to put the money we save into this program and that program . " People want that . One of Clinton 's problems is that he designed his campaign when the mood of the country was ambivalent  --  he did n't need big ideas for change . Now 70 percent of the country thinks we are in terrible shape , which is driving the Jerry Brown , Ross Perot , and Pat Buchanan campaigns . The good news is that people want a big change and Bush does n't have a clue . The bad news is that Clinton does n't have enough zing in his ideas . He needs the big idea . If he comes out for , say , doubling the money we spend on education , that would be a big idea for the country . Does it win the campaign on its own ? No . But it gets people thinking , " Is this guy credible ? I like the idea , but can I trust him to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make that a way of addressing the character problems . TOUGH : But we 're the media team . Are n't we supposed to work with the ideas the candidate 's got ? ESKEW : I do n't think we can work with what we 've got . The ideas have to be bigger . TRIPPI : I agree . We ca n't just tinker around the edges . People do n't want that . They do n't want to choose between two guys arguing over a capital-gains tax cut . They want drastic change . I 'd do a spot that said , " Thomas Jefferson thought we should have a revolution every nineteen years . We have n't had one in two hundred years and it 's starting to show . I 'm not perfect , but I know our country needs real drastic change . That 's why , as your president , I 'll do bam-bam-bam . " That 's the positive spot . Then you do a negative track that plays into " There 's a revolution going on everywhere but here . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And I would take the chance on Clinton delivering it to the camera . I agree with Carter : we have to at least get people to ask themselves whether they trust Clinton . We 're going to win or lose on that question . TOUGH : Look , Clinton does have ideas . Ca n't we sit him in front of a camera , have him talk about the issues he 's got , and explain that these programs are a real change ? ESKEW : We can take the platform and try to hype it into drastic change , but I do n't think people will buy it . TRIPPI : Not the stuff Clinton 's talking about these days . TOUGH : Ken , do you think we can sit Clinton down and have him talk to the camera ? SWOPE : No . Clinton was created and destroyed by the free media . He was anointed . It was n't his commercials that got him there . They were boring and no one paid any attention to them . The only message he had was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ESKEW : The spot doubled his points . SWOPE : Well , I do n't know if the ad did that or the press did that . I do n't think you can have a candidate talk about issues to the camera until the very end of the campaign , when people suddenly really want to know what the candidate is about . Before that , you 've got to use the power and the language and the emotion of television to make people watch the commercial . TOUGH : Can you do that in a positive way ? SWOPE : Well , I agree with Carter that the jig is up on political advertising . All the artificial stuff , all the drama techniques  --  Jack Kemp throwing the football to the Norman Rockwell townspeople  --  everybody knows it 's fake . Remember Dukakis 's " packaging of George Bush " ads , with actors playing Bush 's strategists ? By trying to point out Bush 's duplicity , those ads revealed their own . People see right through that . The American people may be politically uninformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue they 're going out of their minds because they 'll spend a million dollars just producing a commercial and their ratings show that nobody watches it . So for us to believe that everyone 's sitting there with bated breath to see what our boring candidate has to say in our relatively low-budget commercials is the height of hubris . TOUGH : Hold on . We 're trying to write our first ad , and you guys are telling me that ads do n't work ? SWOPE : No , but we have to take the old ideas about political ads and throw them out the window . What 's turning people off is all the artifice and fakery . For my ads the speech would be the key . I start by writing Clinton a beautiful speech filled with great 30-second clips , each on one single , compelling , dramatic idea  --  whether it 's rebuilding infrastructure or pro-choice or child care or putting people back to work  --  strong ideas , all of which we choose based on our polling data . Clinton works on the speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days I film him giving it live . He 's excited . His speech gets better and better . I pluck out the best 30-second pieces and intersperse shots of Clinton with faces in the audience , as well as dramatic cutaways of other footage to illustrate what he 's talking about . TOUGH : Carter , does that work for you ? ESKEW : Well , not exactly . I do n't see why that 's necessarily less artificial than anything else . TRIPPI : Clinton has crossed the threshold of believability . We 've got a candidate who , when he wins the bloody New York primary , says , " I had a ball here , " and everybody thinks , " Give me a break ! " At some point he 's going to have to look people dead in the eye , and either they 're going to trust him or they are not . Given that , I would start his spots with him speaking directly to the camera . THE REPUBLICANS GO TO ARKANSAS BOYNTON : Well , I 've got some bad news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do so well . Bush still has these very high negatives , and I 'm coming back to you for help . STEVENS : It 's time to go negative . There is a tragic flaw to the Clinton candidacy that we have to exploit : it 's Arkansas . If his mandate is to bring economic change to America , we have to look no farther than his home state to prove he ca n't do it . Were it not for the dedication of my home state of Mississippi , Arkansas would be last in every imaginable category . Here is a guy who has run Arkansas since the late Seventies with a legislature controlled by Democrats . And he wants to bring economic change to America ? It 's like the punch line to a bad joke ! So my first negative ad would show the Arkansas delta , one of the more bleak , depressing places in the world . I 'd have a caravan of limos driving a Clinton look-alike around . He 'd be visiting sharecropper shacks , quoting the exact words from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot of him at one of those miserable schools where they pay teachers $16,000 a year and have him say something about education . And I would intercut this with statistics about what terrible shape Arkansas is in . The spot would end with a closeup of the real Bill Clinton . It would play to two points : First , here is a guy who is good at one thing , which is promising and not delivering . And second , here is a fellow who throughout the Reagan-Bush era had one little corner on the world in which he was king . This is what he has wrought . WILSON : Rob , let 's assume that you 're right and that our first spots did n't work . They will work , eventually . In communication theory we call this the sleeper effect . Your message just waits while people think about it and then actually comes back stronger than when you put it out . While we 're waiting , I too would do an Arkansas ad . My Arkansas ad would have the camera follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out of its engine . It would be driving through some godforsaken part of the Ozarks . You let the camera do the talking : the car passes decrepit shacks , poor kids , deteriorating schools . I would also put in images of chickens being slaughtered , which is one of the biggest industries in the state and the only thing Bill Clinton managed to get for it . And then I would pan over a group of out-of-work men . Then the announcer would say , " Bill Clinton 's dream for America has been cooking in the Arkansas sun for ten years and it 's still half-baked . After ten years as governor , Arkansas is forty-ninth in per capita income , fiftieth in teachers ' salaries , forty-eighth in employment . This is n't a dream for America  --  it 's a nightmare . Re-elect the President . " STEVENS : I would never use the word " re-elect " for George Bush . BOYNTON : Why is that ? STEVENS : The Democrats are going to attack on the change issue , so to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , I 'd say , " Elect George Bush and elect change . " WILSON : But the main point of either of these spots would be to make the Democrats eat that line of Joe 's  --  " We can do it here . " They would be gagging on it before the campaign was over . " We can do it here " would become a mocking phrase pointing out that Clinton did n't do it in Arkansas . Clinton 's only theme is " It 's time for a change . " So we have to strip that theme from him by saying , " The Clinton promise does n't match with the Clinton reality . " THE DEMOCRATS GO TO HOLLYWOOD TOUGH : We 're running an ad that 's got Clinton talking about changes and how he 's going to accomplish them . But the Republicans have hit us with some pretty brutal ads about Arkansas . How do we respond ? ESKEW : One way would be to run an ad that says : " Look , the reason Arkansas is screwed up is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's who 's really to blame for the condition of this state . " By this time the press would have gone down to Arkansas and seen that Clinton 's been an okay governor and done some good things , so they would be sympathetic to our defense . It gives you an opportunity , as Dukakis had , to come back and say , " It 's true Boston Harbor is a disgrace . You know why ? Because the federal government wo n't fund sewage cleanup . " It gets you back in the game after a very powerful attack . TRIPPI : I would take this back to Washington and to George Bush being there for forty years , and use it to refer back to our change theme . I would end the spot with a narrator saying , " There are fifty governors in America , and their state economies have all gone in the toilet . Maybe they 're all bad  --  or maybe the place for real change is in the White House . " That would turn it back on them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all having to cope with higher taxes , education problems , etc . Everybody knows that . ESKEW : I agree with that response . I think that Bush 's attack will be initially effective but also gets him onto very dangerous ground . TOUGH : But Boston Harbor worked . Why wo n't Arkansas ? ESKEW : Boston Harbor worked in a very different atmosphere . It was in a year of economic optimism , and it worked because it was never responded to . TRIPPI : Another spot might be to show newspaper headlines of different states in deep , deep trouble as an announcer asks , " Where 's the real problem ? " Right now people are convinced the problem is Washington , D.C. , whether it 's the President or Congress . Bush is an animal of the " place . The Republicans are more embarrassed about that than Clinton is about Arkansas . TOUGH : Ken , would you respond to Arkansas or do a new ad ? SWOPE : You can make cases for Arkansas both ways . You could say that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot . In the speech spots I 'm going to do there would be lots of bio information , which would include all the positive stuff about Arkansas . But we 've got to get it out there before the Republicans run their negative Arkansas spot so that the issue is already neutralized . Otherwise , we 're going to be vulnerable . TOUGH : So instead of saying , " Arkansas sucks and it 's George Bush 's fault , " we just say , " Everyone knows Arkansas is a poor state  --  Clinton 's done a pretty good job with what he had " ? SWOPE : Yes . You explain that he was voted governor of the year for a reason . TOUGH : Let 's make our first ad about Bush . Where do we start ? SWOPE : I 'm leaning very heavily on doing commercials that have " all natural ingredients "  --  that have no fake elements to them . I would select a dozen well-known people from Hollywood , like Kirk Douglas , James Earl Jones , Michael Douglas , Burr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit them in an extremely well-lit room , casually dressed , just talking . They would do the attack ads on Bush in a way that would make an issue out of Bush 's character and integrity . Jack Lemmon could talk about the fact that when , as vice president , Bush was chairman of the Regulatory Relief Task Force he blocked regulations for almost two years to put warning labels on aspirin to treat Reye 's syndrome , causing hundreds of children to become brain-damaged or die . I would cut away to some very emotional images and then cut back to Jack Lemmon , who would say , " What kind of character does that show ? " People would say , " Who gives a damn if Clinton cheated on his wife ? Compared to this ? Jesus ! " I could come up with twenty different ads like that : " As president and vice president , George Bush did the bidding of the NRA , blocking legislation to regulate automatic weapons and cop-killing bullets . " I 'd get Kirk Douglas to talk about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were brought up to trust them . The older Reagan Democrats , especially , trust people like Kirk Douglas . It would be even worse than Willie Horton . That 's how you get free media coverage . The ad is so sensational they have to keep reporting on it and Bush has to keep responding . You want foreign policy ? How about showing toys coming in from China with import duties reduced and then cutting away to the Chinese slave-labor camps and the Tiananmen Square massacre ? There 's foreign policy and the character issue . TOUGH : And each time it 's one of these Hollywood figures who does the voice-over ? SWOPE : Yes . I would choose them very carefully from the ranks of the Hollywood Democrat crowd . They raise tons of money for politicians , and I know from my experience with Dukakis that they would do these ads . TOUGH : Do you pay them ? SWOPE : Yes , we pay them union scale because they 're members of the actors ' unions , and we say so in the ad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we 're worried about media artifice , to be using paid actors ? SWOPE : Who does n't trust Spartacus ? TOUGH : And as these spots come out accusing Bush of these awful things , do you have Clinton mention them in his speeches or does he ignore them ? SWOPE : Clinton never mentions the ads . We keep him some distance from them . TOUGH : Joe , do these attacks on Bush work for you ? TRIPPI : They do n't bother me , although I would probably go with a direct-to-the-camera shot with the candidate for the spots . TOUGH : Even the negative spots ? TRIPPI : Sure . TOUGH : Is there a more general ad that we can use to blame Bush for the country 's malaise ? ESKEW : We have to tap into the sense people have that they are falling behind and that Bush just does n't understand or care . He is on the record saying he 'd just as soon " do nothing " on the economy . So I 'd do a spot that started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and so on  --  to remind people of Bush 's culpability . A spot that gets at economic and character issues will work . If we run some of the attack ads that both the Democrats and Republicans are describing , the public will say , " Wait a minute . You 're saying Bush is killing children ? You 're saying Clinton is in favor of illiteracy and poverty ? That 's ridiculous ! " Those ads do n't resonate as true . But people really do believe Bush has an empathy problem , so it 's something we can use . TOUGH : Ken , how would you do an attack ad on the economy to bring out the fact that Bush does n't empathize with the common man ? SWOPE : I would find a person whom polls show our target voters really trust and have him say , " This is what George Bush said about the economy . This is what he did . He lied . I trust Clinton to do what he says he 's going to do . " TOUGH : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SWOPE : Abandoned factories or empty warehouses , people in unemployment lines . Newspaper headlines would be good , too  --  things like General Motors announcing massive layoffs . TRIPPI : I like that spot , but Ken 's notion of ten different people saying all this negative stuff worries me . I might shoot just a few of them in one spot docu-style and straight-up . If we go with too many of these attacks , people are going to see so much meanness that they 'll be disgusted . You 've got to hook into what people already believe . Our negative spot has to say , " This guy 's been there forever . It 's time for a change . " ESKEW : I wonder , though , if these ads will really work . We 're talking about tactics that have been around for twenty years . Maybe they 'll work again , but I have a sense that maybe they wo n't . We keep pushing the button , but the public 's response is no longer there . THE REPUBLICANS BAKE COOKIES BOYNTON : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions to do it . Should we be worried ? STEVENS : Attacking Bush by saying that Clinton 's been governor of Arkansas but it 's not really his fault is crazy . That 's as ludicrous as putting Spartacus on the air to elect the next president . Saying how bad things are can get you only so far . It 's a one-trick pony , and you ca n't ride it across the finish line . The Democrats ' attempt to make Bush 's tax flip-flop into a character issue will be as successful as their accusing Bush of having a mistress . If you compare Bush with Clinton and ask the voters , " Who do you believe has slept with more women ? " no one 's going to pick Bush . People just do n't naturally distrust his character . WEINSCHEL : When it comes to character , the President has a substantially larger catalogue of good things he 's done . All people know about Clinton is that they do n't trust him and he 's been governor of Arkansas . He has to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional ways a politician rebuilds himself is to tell his real story . But the trouble is that Clinton has no story . All he 's done is run for office . Clinton writes a letter that the Vietnam War is terrible and he 's gaining all this weight worrying about it . Sort of the bulimic 's answer to Vietnam . Whereas George Bush is a legitimate war hero . He actually does have a story that people find compelling . At eighteen he was the youngest commissioned pilot in the Navy . These are facts . BOYNTON : So what does your ad do ? Does it point out the lack of a Clinton story or does it tell George Bush 's story ? STEVENS : What their life stories reflect are the choices the two of them have made . You can parallel their lives choice by choice , and people will find Bush 's story much more appealing . BOYNTON : How do you point out that difference ? STEVENS : You can compare lives . This question of the military draft is perfect  --  just compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Vietnam . The idea that when Clinton was twenty-three years old he was worried about his future political career makes him sound like the twelve-year-old who does n't go out for Little League because he 's studying for the bar exam ! That just rubs people the wrong way . BOYNTON : So do you sit Bush down and have him tell his life story ? STEVENS : No , I 'm against having candidates staring into the camera . We do it only at the very end . There are much more compelling , interesting ways to tell stories . If you have ads that look like political ads , people will be turned off . There 's a reason people respond to ads by AT &T,; Nike , and Coca-Cola : they know how to tell a story . WILSON : The economy is Bush 's most vulnerable spot , and we 've got to defend it . Our first ads said we were pointed in a new direction ; our second set of ads said that when Clinton had his chance to change Arkansas he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where we question whether Clinton can accomplish what he is promising . This is where we pair him with Jimmy Carter  --  we marry them inseparably . The memories of the economy during Carter 's presidency are much worse than anything that has happened under Bush . I 'd do a series of spots with people in Arkansas telling us they think Clinton 's a lot like Jimmy Carter . Our spots will get across the message that " If you let Clinton try to improve the economy , it may actually get worse . " These spots will be devastating . They should be reinforced with some companion spots that show there are sectors of the economy that are improving . From the first attack ad on we have to show that things are improving . STEVENS : I disagree . People will find it insulting if you tell them that things are actually better than they think they are . People will hear , " You think things are terrible , but you just do n't understand . " And they 'll think , " There 's someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goddamnit , why not me ? " BOYNTON : How do you do the Jimmy Carter comparison ? WILSON : We do interviews in which each person tells us , " He reminds me a lot of Jimmy Carter " or " Clinton is just like Jimmy Carter in many respects . " Then we go to people from Arkansas saying , " It 's funny  --  he has an idea for everything , but nothing really works . " And in the same spot have people remind us that Carter gave us 10 percent unemployment and astronomical interest rates . Now we 're layering the message . We 're adding pieces of information to a very direct line that at the end says , " Vote for Bush . " STEVENS : Although I 'm not a big fan of using the Gulf War , I want to do one ad that uses it . It is a 60-second spot that reminds people of the negatives involved when George Bush first decided to go to war . It was an unpopular stand . Bush was willing to be a one-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preposterous statement that he would have voted with the majority in Congress for the war but supported the minority against it  --  that is Bill Clinton in a nutshell ! At the defining moment of our time , Clinton stands up and waves both arms ! I would not say , " Remember the Gulf War ; remember how popular it was . " I 'd say , " Remember the Gulf War ; remember how unpopular it was . But George Bush was willing to fight . " WILSON : It 's time for a curve ball to the Democrats . We now interject a different element and take advantage of another of Bush 's strong points . We bring in Barbara . As hokey as it might sound , I would have Barbara Bush with her grandkids making cookies . It would be a terribly contrived spot , but it probably really happens . It would be the warmest ad you could imagine . Barbara would do a very short narration  --  it would be mostly licking bowls and eating the cookies and putting them in the oven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come right at the question of Hillary Clinton . STEVENS : It could have a soundtrack of Tammy Wynette singing " Stand By Your Man . " WILSON : And Barbara could talk about change , but also say : " The simple experiences that enrich lives are important , too . " THE DEMOCRATS MAKE FOG MACHINES TOUGH : They 're hitting us on Jimmy Carter , they 're attacking us with a comparison of the two candidates ' life stories , they 're saying we 're going to make the economy worse , they 've got Clinton 's indecision on the Gulf War , and they 've got Barbara making cookies . What do we do ? TRIPPI : I would n't do a Hillary ad . It 's a mistake to put Barbara and Hillary in a head-on competition . What I would do is run a straight pro-choice ad to bring the issue of choice into the election . Barbara Bush is pro-choice , and we could do something with that . ESKEW : You might have fun with the kitchen spot . You could run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara talks about in the kitchen with George ? It 's probably not just cookies . Maybe they even talk about whether or not women should have the right to choose . Barbara Bush happens to think they should . She 's right . " SWOPE : We also need a commercial to counteract their ads setting up Bush as the candidate of change . We ca n't let them get away with that . I usually use only all-natural ingredients , but on this ad I would n't . It 's called " Mirrors " and would feature a black box , inside of which would hang a collage of several strangely shaped shards of glass turned slowly by a motor . They would be backlit and give off a weird glow . Onto the shards we project an image of Bush making a speech , so when you rotate this thing you see fragments of his image distorted by the mirrors . It looks sort of like a Picasso  --  an eye here , a mouth moving there . I 'd add some fog too . Over this you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only time his voice comes through clearly is when he screams , " Cut capital gains ! " Then we 'd have Michael Douglas do the voice-over . He 'd say : " It 's so strange . Bizarre . Suddenly , George Bush is rearranging his image , selling himself as a candidate of change . Change ! And he says Congress is stopping him from making the changes he wants . You know what the biggest change he wants is ? More tax cuts for the rich and big business to stimulate the economy , more trickle-down economics . Is n't that precisely what got us into this mess in the first place ? So George Bush 's idea of change is more of the same . It 's all smoke and mirrors , folks . " TOUGH : Do we respond to any of the other Republican attacks ? What about the Jimmy Carter ad ? ESKEW : Jimmy Carter probably has a higher positive rating today than Bush . I do n't believe in responding to every ad , but maybe there 's an opportunity there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn it back on them . This time we go to Jimmy Carter at one of his Habitat for Humanity projects and have him say , " They 've been beating up on me for a long time . I can take it . But ask yourself , what 's happening to this country ? I 've tried to do the right thing for this country . Now let 's talk about things that matter  --  like where we 're going . What are they so scared of ? " THE REPUBLICANS USE RACE BOYNTON : What about Gennifer Flowers and Clinton 's golf game at the all-white country club ? Do we touch these ? STEVENS : No , I do n't think you bring up either . Bush ca n't credibly use the golf issue . And I do n't think we should ever bring up anything about infidelity . Ultimately , people do n't care . BOYNTON : What about getting an outside group to do ads on those issues ? ( See page 45 . ) So-called independent-expenditure groups were able to say a lot of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you see a role for them in this case ? STEVENS : No , it would be a disaster . Outside groups just confuse our message . We ca n't control them . BOYNTON : Did the Willie Horton ad , which was made by an outside group , help or hurt Bush in the last election ? STEVENS : I think that Willie Horton not only hurt Bush but continues to seriously hurt him today . WEINSCHEL : I do n't agree with that at all . That ad basically won the campaign for him . Independent expenditures can bring up issues you do n't want to be associated with . You can sit back and say , " We think it 's awful and they should take it off the air , " yet it 's out there in everybody 's mind . Once the ad is out there , the campaign and the news media can play with it . WILSON : There 's a couple of uses for independent expenditures  --  with Gennifer Flowers , for instance . There 's a vast malleable segment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from day to day , depending on how the argument is phrased . Gennifer Flowers can counter a sliver of the pro-choice women . If you had an ad that started with Clinton 's abominable , stumbling denials on 60 Minutes , and then had woman after woman saying , " I do n't believe him , " you could start whacking away at that segment . They could also make use of the country-club issue . We know that Clinton 's going to win 90 to 95 percent of the black vote . So an independent expenditure could do a country-club ad showing that Clinton is racially insensitive . It would say to black voters , " You do n't have a player in this race . " It would discourage black turnout . Every black vote that stays home would be two votes for Bush . THE DEMOCRATS USE ROE V. WADE TOUGH : Democrats , is there a way to counter the country-club ad ? ESKEW : You do a spot saying that Bush is dividing the country , race against race : " First there was Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a strong statement that the idea that Clinton is weak on civil rights is ludicrous , so let 's just stop this horseshit . That would be a powerful spot . TRIPPI : We 'd respond , maybe on the radio , with some credible black spokespeople saying that a lot is at stake and it is important to vote . TOUGH : That Republican ad came from an outside group . Are the Democrats going to have any outside groups this year ? ESKEW : I 'm sure the National Abortion Rights Action League is going to be doing something on the choice issue . Environmental groups will do something . TOUGH : But can we use them the way the Republicans do to bring up issues we do n't want associated with our campaign , like race ? TRIPPI : Nobody 's going to get away with that this time . Voters just are n't going to buy it . TOUGH : Let me give you a scenario . Roe v. Wade is substantially undercut by the Supreme Court . In response , Congress passes the Freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vetoes it . Clinton is in favor of it . There 's a march on Washington , and a million people show up . What ad do you run ? ESKEW : We do n't need to run an ad . TRIPPI : I agree . Just the fact of the ruling will get us two zillion points of information from the media . We wo n't have to pay for it . SWOPE : I 'd consider doing an ad saying , " If you care about your right to choose , it 's now or never . " But we 'd do it in the context of the Supreme Court and any appointments the next president might make . You do n't frame it in terms of abortion . TRIPPI : I 'd make an ad that showed Clarence Thomas and the other Reagan and Bush appointees . I 'd run it right after the decision and let it ride the wave , but I would n't spend lots of money . THE REPUBLICANS APPEAL TO CHARACTER BOYNTON : Clinton 's people do their ads on abortion , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dropping in the polls . What do we do ? STEVENS : Bomb Libya and make sure we 've got good video ! WEINSCHEL : Are you going to hand-hold that shot too , Stuart ? WILSON : I would do two things . First , show it as a strong character decision by Bush and , second , in a strange sort of way , drop it on Congress as an example of how out of touch they are with the people and how incapable they are of making a decision . My ad would start with the most violent Operation Rescue footage I could find , perhaps from Wichita , Kansas . Then I 'd go to Fargo , North Dakota , where the Lambs of Christ have been protesting . STEVENS : Is this your ad for the Democrats or for the Republicans ? WILSON : For us . Then I 'd have the President in the White House saying , " For over twenty years the country 's been divided on the issue of abortion . I pray it must stop . But you must stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I vetoed the abortion-rights bill not to frustrate this nation , not to anger people , but to give you the chance to make a decision yourself , in your state , in your community . I have no confidence in the Congress of this country to make this important decision for you . They are completely out of touch with your lives and your values . As Abraham Lincoln said of slavery , this issue of abortion tears at the very fabric of our nation . As President , my decision is for this issue to be decided by each state . " STEVENS : If the election turns into a referendum on abortion , the Democrats win it . It 's that simple . To join the issue at all is a losing scenario . In the free media I would have Bush say , " Here 's what I think on this issue , but I respect others who disagree with me . " The abortion issue is most effective when it is seen as resonating within the larger issue of how one feels about women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward women , voters will be more accepting of different opinions on a specific issue . THE DEMOCRATS TALK CHANGE TOUGH : Democrats , we 're in the last week . We are pulling even with the President . What do we do ? SWOPE : We continue and intensify with very strong imagery against Bush , questioning his integrity and framing it as a trust issue . So the thought people have before they vote is , " I do n't trust either of these guys , but I sure as hell do n't want any more of what George Bush has been doing . That 's worse than who Bill Clinton is sleeping with . " TRIPPI : I would go the same way we started  --  that this is a choice about drastic change . I do n't think we can base the final ads on character , because people are much more comfortable with Bush . They 've known him longer , they 've grown up with his dog , Millie . It 's got to be about drastic change . The American people are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are going right now , I think they will . SWOPE : It 's sad , because the election is going to come down to people saying , " Who 's the worse bum  --  the one who I kind of trust or the one who I sort of like ? " SLICK WILLIE HORTON ? TONY FABRIZIO is a partner at Fabrizio , McLaughlin &; Associates . FLOYD BROWN is the chairman of the Presidential Victory Committee . In 1988 Fabrizio and Brown produced the " Willie Horton " ad . Last fall Fabrizio also produced the " Who Will Judge the Judge ? " ad in support of Clarence Thomas . PAUL TOUGH : Let 's say you 've set up an independent group to make ads supporting the President 's re-election . What will your role be in the fall campaign ? TONY FABRIZIO : We 're going to fill in the gaps . We can handle topics that the Bush campaign , for political reasons , either wo n't or ca n't do . For instance , because of all the conflict-of-interest charges against the Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising questions about Hillary Clinton 's law firm 's dealings with the Arkansas state government . But an independent group can ask those questions all day long . We 're not the candidate , so we do n't pay the price for using hard tactics . TOUGH : Suppose that in the general election the Bush campaign is running ads about Bill Clinton 's integrity . What ad would you make to help ? FABRIZIO : There has n't been enough information out there on who Clinton really is . Sure , everybody knows about Gennifer Flowers . But there are still a lot of questions about the draft , marijuana , and so on . So I 'd do an ad with a 900 number . It would start with a voice saying , " Call this number to find out the things Bill Clinton does n't want you to know . " And when you called the number you 'd be offered a menu : " Press 1 to hear Clinton talking to Gennifer Flowers ; press 2 to hear Clinton flip-flop on the draft ; press 3 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear about Hillary Clinton and her law firm 's dealings with the state . " Each selection in the ad would be accompanied by an appropriate image . TOUGH : How much do you charge ? FABRIZIO : Ninety-nine cents a minute . The spot would pay for itself . Every reporter in the country is going to call it , and go through every number on the menu . TOUGH : Would you do an ad about Hillary Clinton ? FABRIZIO : Ah ! My pet peeve . She is as big an albatross as he is . She 's one step away from destroying the campaign . She is arrogant , she 's aloof , and she looks down her nose at other women . So I 'd do an ad on family values . I 'd get a grandmotherly looking woman to say , " Bill Clinton says he supports traditional family values . Yet his own wife says , " I do n't stay home and bake cookies . ' What 's wrong with baking cookies , Hillary ? " Or I 'd have an exhausted-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . She slams down her briefcase and says , " I 've had it with Hillary Clinton . I work . I love my family . I wish I could afford to stay home with my children . But I ca n't , because the Democrats keep raising taxes and taking all of my money . Now she says she 's going to help her husband run the country ? Hillary , maybe you should stay home . " TOUGH : You 're not going to have as much money as the Bush campaign . Are there any techniques you can use to stretch your ad dollars ? FABRIZIO : When we do a controversial ad , the money we spend to air it is inconsequential next to the free media coverage we get for it . FLOYD BROWN : When we did the first Willie Horton ad in 1988 , we spent only $200,000 on airtime . But we were featured on the CBS Evening News , which is time you just ca n't buy . We got over a million dollars in free exposure . ROBERT BOYNTON : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story ? FABRIZIO : First , you 've got to be timely . Second , the story 's got to be credible . Third , it 's got to be documented . BOYNTON : How would you get free media for the 900-number ad ? FABRIZIO : We have a press conference the day we put it on the air . TOUGH : What if the Bush campaign comes out publicly and says , " These guys are a menace . We want them to stop " ? BROWN : We keep running the ad . TOUGH : Do the Bush people really want you to stop running it ? BROWN : Well , in 1988 Jim Baker came out against us , demanding that we pull Willie Horton . But right after the election Lee Atwater told me , " The only thing wrong with the Willie Horton ad was that you did n't run it twenty-four hours a day . " <p>
