<p> IT 'S another sign that Mars and Venus are taking over the earth : John Gray is coming to Broadway . <p> Mr. Gray , the relationships guru who preaches that men and women think and communicate so differently that they might as well come from different planets , has become as ubiquitous as Bill Gates . <p> With 5 books , 12 videotapes , 30 annual weekend seminars , 22 counseling centers and 50 more in the works , and 2 Web sites ( not to mention a coming film and television show ) all dedicated to explaining Martians ( men ) to Venusians ( women ) and vice versa , Mr. Gray has created a Disneylike multimedia empire . <p> Gentle in mien , ernest in demeanor , he is , like the famously nerdy Mr. Gates , an unlikely seeming empire builder . Fastidiously and expensively groomed but with a suburban-dad style , Mr. Gray , 45 , is a former teacher and marketer of transcendental meditation , who spent nine years working for Maharishi Mahesh Yogi , who began studying psychology because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who later became a marriage counselor . <p> But tomorrow night , there he will be , bringing his therapy-as-theater one-man show to Broadway 's most capacious auditorium , the 1,933-seat Gershwin , to begin a weeklong engagement . " Men Are From Mars , Women Are From Venus , " also the title of the 1992 best seller that has sold upward of 10 million copies , is an updated version of the traveling show that Mr. Gray , who is on his intermittent way around the world , brought to Carnegie Hall last year . Several of the eight performances ( $20 to $55 a ticket ) are nearly sold out . <p> Indeed , Mr. Gray , probably more than anyone else , has given talking about relationships in public a middle-class sheen of mundane decency . What Mickey did for mice . <p> " What I 'm good at is stand-up , talking , sharing , telling funny stories , " Mr. Gray said last week at the Rihga Royal Hotel after arriving from his Mill Valley , Calif. , home on his private plane . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . I have the ability as a counselor to mediate between people . " <p> In this confessional age , theater is , perhaps , a natural extension of the Mars-Venus universe . What Mr. Gray does in print is deliver verbal balm for relationships in crisis . He does the same on stage , through storytelling , gentle wheedling and audience interaction . In some ways , his act is a confluence of the soul baring encouraged by Jerry Springer , Jenny Jones and other talk-show hosts and the artful confessional practiced by the likes of Spalding Gray , Charlayne Woodard and Claudia Shear that has made the personal monologue a staple of the stage . And also , it is a time that seems focused on marital affairs . <p> " Couples have become more and more appreciative of the complexities of long-term relationships , " said Annabeth Benningfield , the president-elect of the 23,000-member American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy . " They 're looking for assistance to make it work . " <p> On Wednesday , Broadway 's other **29;503;TOOLONG , " Defending the Caveman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over for the show 's originator , Rob Becker . After 545 performances , a Broadway record for a one-person show , Mr. Becker temporarily closed the show on Jan. 4 and took it on the road . <p> It 's a success story in a similar vein , but Mr. Becker is not a therapist or a psychologist like Mr. Gray . Mr. Becker began his performing life doing stand-up comedy , then brought to his act some academic research on sex roles and sex differences . His theme is that today 's men and women instinctively recall prehistoric hunting and gathering societies . " Defending the Caveman " is presented in narrative form , a tale of Mr. Becker 's own self-discovery . It 's a story with a message , theater as therapy , the opposite of Mr. Gray 's approach , delivering a message with stories , therapy as theater . <p> Speaking last week from Miami , where he was performing " Caveman , " Mr. Becker said : " Every once in a while people will ask me , ' Will you give me advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , I 'll give you advice , but you have to remember I 'm a comedian . ' " <p> Mr. Gray 's work has evolved along a converse path . As a marriage counselor with a doctorate in psychology from Columbia Pacific University in San Rafael , Calif. , he developed theories and wrote about them , beginning in a somewhat academic vein . Then he quite consciously hammed it up . <p> " I used to be very serious , " he said , adding that " Men Are From Mars , Women Are From Venus , " which has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 192 weeks , is easier to digest than his " Men , Women and Relationships . " <p> " It 's a great book , people love it , " he said of that earlier book , " but most people never finished it . " His goal in writing " Mars-Venus , " he continued , " was to make it sort of easy reading , so you could flow right in , not have to think much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , this one for singles ( " Mars and Venus on a Date " ) , is due from HarperCollins in May ; why 20th Century Fox is preparing a Mars-Venus feature film for release next Valentine 's Day ; why ABC is planning a prime-time Mars-Venus special the first Sunday in June  --  Marriage Day , Mr. Gray said , adding that he created the holiday last year  --  and why a weekly show featuring him working with three couples an episode is in the works for ABC in the fall . <p> Mr. Gray , an avowed fan of " Caveman , " said that when he saw Mr. Becker 's show , he felt a sense of validation . " But the difference between us is very clear , " he said . " He 's a comedian who I think also helps men and women understand their differences better . And I 'm a teacher who uses comedy to convey the message . I try to bring out the dignity in men and women . Sometimes humor does n't do that . " <p> Whether either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Becker 's show is immensely popular , but has been reviewed largely without enthusiasm ; reviews of Mr. Gray are coming . Whether either is good therapy is also up in the air . <p> " The approach to helping couples understand each other based on a more general , gender-related style is probably a very good one , " said Ms. Benningfield , who allowed that she is more a fan of Mr. Becker 's less prescriptive approach . " It helps release tension for couples , allows couples to laugh at themselves . They feel they 're not alone . John Gray 's emphasis on different communications styles is very helpful for some people , but it 's a very complex undertaking to understand why two people who care about each other ca n't get along . <p> " There is a risk to oversimplification , " she said . " If it 's seen as , ' This should explain our problem , ' and it does n't , that can lead to pathologizing : ' Well , then there must be something wrong with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are differences between people makes it easy to live with them . " <p> Mr. Gray said it was the seminars he began giving in the early 1980 's that led to the generalities at the heart of his current wisdom . <p> " A man would make a complaint about his wife , and I 'd ask my audience : ' How many men here feel that way ? ' And sometimes there 'd be this big , ' Yeah ! Yeah ! ' Or sometimes a woman would say something , and all the women would clap . <p> " I would know that 's a gold mine : This is something men do n't understand about women . An example : A woman in the audience would say , ' I just want to complain to him , I do n't want him to fix it . ' And all the women would go ' Yeah . ' And the next talk I 'd give , I 'd say to the men , ' What you have to realize is that she does n't want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , there were few mixed-sex workshops , so there had yet to develop a useful language with which to teach men and women together . <p> " If you went to women-only seminars , for example , you could say : ' O.K , you have to understand your men . They 're like dogs . You reward them , you feed them , they love you . ' Now , there 's a certain element of truth there . If you just love a man , do n't give him a hard time , he 'll just love you . We 're simple creatures . But you ca n't say that in front of an audience of men ; you 'll offend the men . Men have dignity . They do n't want to be compared to dogs . You had to find ways to make the point so you could be in a room of women and men and neither will feel offended . " <p> THE Broadway show is the latest manifestation of that strategy . It is in two parts , the first half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material on Mr. Gray 's videos . " The most funny and entertaining stories , " he said . After intermission , three men and three women will be brought on stage to work out a problem with Mr. Gray , something of a prototype for the proposed television series . ( Some of these will be celebrities , chosen in advance , like Cindy and Joey Adams and the model Frederique and the rapper Q-Tip . The others will be audience volunteers . ) The idea is that one of the participants will ask a vexing question about his or or her mate  --  Why wo n't he ask directions when he 's lost ? or some such  --  and then Mr. Gray will lead a discussion on the way to answering it . <p> " It 's pure entertainment , " Mr. Gray said . " People come in and have a good time , feel good about themselves and do n't leave feeling that when they leave they have to do something about their relationship . In a sense they leave feeling they 've been let off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as it is theatrical . <p> " I do n't think there 's any question it 's entertaining , " said James B. Freydberg , producer of both Claudia Shear 's and Julia Sweeney 's one-woman shows and also of the Broadway musical " Big . " " But it 's not a theater piece at all . It 's from some other planet . "
