<p> ON a recent Wednesday evening , white stretch limousines crowded the parking lot at Andersen Consulting 's headquarters in Palo Alto , Calif . The drivers waited to take the firm 's top partners and their counterparts at Arthur Andersen , the accounting firm , to dinner at Spago , an elegant restaurant downtown . <p> Even though the sister firms had been feuding for months , George T. Shaheen , managing partner at Andersen Consulting , had planned for the top partners on both sides of the Andersen Worldwide family to dine together . <p> But the limo drivers never saw their expected passengers . The first official meeting between the Andersens since December , when Mr. Shaheen told the world that Andersen Consulting wanted to go its own way , had quickly gone sour . <p> Like most family feuds , this one is about money . Lately , the consultants have begun to earn more than their peers on the accounting side , and they do n't want to hand over any of that money to the accountants . Moreover , they are furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of giving advice . <p> In recent days , the bad blood has boiled over , creating an all-out brawl . Divorce , both insiders and outsiders say , is almost inevitable . Little more remains than a division of the spoils and deciding who keeps the Andersen name . <p> It 's a perilous business being the largest professional partnership in the world . And the startling thing is that the feud involves experts whose trade is advising executives on how to run their businesses . " They should all be embarrassed , " said Tom Rodenhauser , president of Consulting Information Services in Keene , N.H. " People are saying : ' Ca n't they figure this out ? Is n't that what they are paid to do ? ' " <p> Even though it may be years before the feud is settled , the two sides already act as separate firms and fierce rivals , with top partners snarling at one another over clients like lions eyeing the same gazelle . <p> At Andersen 's offices around the world , Andersen Consulting employees are making plans to separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done so . <p> In New York , at joint offices at 54th Street and the Avenue of the Americas , Mr. Shaheen and Jim Wadia , Arthur Andersen 's top managing partner , had sat in adjoining offices whenever they were in the city on the same day  --  a situation that employees said grew more and more tense . When Andersen Consulting remodeled the 18th floor in January , Mr. Wadia 's office was moved to the 12th . <p> In Chicago , while the two sides still share space at 33 West Monroe Street , the security card of an Arthur Andersen employee will not open the doors leading to Andersen Consulting . <p> Even the two units ' Web sites are not linked . <p> " They are beyond the point of no return , " Gresham T. Brebach , a former senior consulting partner , said recently . " There is no way they can reconcile . They have lost the partnership spirit . " <p> Inside Andersen Worldwide , the umbrella organization for the two businesses , partners have grown concerned that they may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Andersen Consulting , which hired 12,000 people last year , many of them M.B.A . ' s , recently sent letters to top business schools , trying to reassure students that the firm 's future was bright and giving them a phone number to call if they had concerns . <p> THE feud comes at a precarious time for Andersen Worldwide . The firm is on the brink of losing its place as the world 's largest accounting and consulting firm to Price Waterhouse and Coopers &; Lybrand , which received Justice Department approval for their merger Thursday . ( They still need European regulators to sign off . ) <p> Analysts say they know of no clients that the Andersens may have lost as a result of their bickering . But one competitor , the Deloitte &; Touche Consulting Group , recently began running newspaper ads saying that while Deloitte was " focused " on clients , Andersen Consulting was " distracted by in-fighting . " <p> The two sides of Andersen do agree , however , that their brawl can not be good for business . They agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , they are arguing behind closed doors before an independent arbitrator at the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris , following Mr. Shaheen 's request in December for binding arbitration to settle the Andersens ' future . <p> But more details of this private war leaked out late last month at a court hearing in New York . Andersen Consulting had filed a lawsuit to try to blunt a resolution , passed by the accountants who comprise a majority of the 27-member board that manages Andersen Worldwide , asserting their control . The resolution was passed on Feb. 12 , the day after the dinner plans at Spago were abandoned , with the Arthur Andersen partners deciding to dine separately . <p> At the hearing , Barry R. Ostrager , a lawyer for Andersen Consulting , told Judge John G. Koeltl of the Federal District Court in Manhattan that the resolution created a " protection committee , " made up only of Arthur Andersen partners , that would essentially take over Andersen Worldwide . <p> " What we have here is hardball tactics of the most naked and unreasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Mr. Ostrager said that Arthur Andersen was trying to put its consulting brothers and sisters " out of business , " James Quinn , a lawyer for Arthur Andersen , told the judge that the contention was " absurd . " The two sides are tied together financially , Mr. Quinn said , and any attempt by Arthur Andersen to hurt Andersen Consulting would be " self-destructive . " <p> Addressing the judge , Mr. Quinn referred to Dec. 17 as " a day that will live in infamy in the history of Arthur Andersen . " For that was the day Andersen Consulting fired off press releases to newsrooms around the world contending that Arthur Andersen had breached its agreement with the consultants by going after the same clients  --  a contention that the accountants say is " false and misleading . " <p> Partners on both sides refuse to talk publicly about the fracas . They do say , however , that business has never been better , with Arthur Andersen 's revenues growing at a 17 percent clip and Andersen Consulting 's revenues up 25 percent last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who say they are nervous , " Mr. Shaheen said . " We have not lost a stride in the marketplace . " <p> Matthew P. Gonring , Arthur Andersen 's managing partner for communications , added : " This filing has not changed Arthur Andersen . Our view is that the interests of clients , partners and employees come first . Our business is fundamentally sound . " <p> IF he were alive , the firm 's founder might well be breaking his pencils . In 1913 , when Arthur E. Andersen , an accounting professor at Northwestern University , founded what was then called Andersen , Delany &; Company in Chicago , his motto was that every accountant should work not for himself ( they were all men in those days ) , but for " one firm . " <p> Later , the firm would install the same style of wooden doors in every Andersen office around the world to give clients and employees the impression of walking into a unified organization . <p> Two months before he died , in January 1947 , Mr. Andersen wrote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , a united family . " A half-century later , the firm is anything but . <p> A matter at the heart of the dispute is who created Andersen Consulting : Did it grow out of the accounting firm or did it spring forth fully formed , a decade ago ? The accountants say the consulting business goes back at least to 1952 , when the accountants helped install General Electric 's first computer system . <p> Privately , the Arthur Andersen partners say that they have invested millions of dollars and more than three decades into building the consulting practice , adding that they are not about to let the consultants get away without collecting a hefty return . <p> The accountants say the partnership agreements  --  which are read by each side in a different way  --  require Andersen Consulting to pay 150 percent of its annual revenues , or nearly $10 billion , to the accountants if it wants to separate . In addition , the accountants say , the agreements require the consultants to drop the Andersen name and to return any technology they have developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their history by beginning with 1989 , the year the firm was split into Arthur Andersen , which would offer traditional accounting services , and Andersen Consulting . <p> The Andersen Consulting partners say that they have since built their side into the world 's largest consulting firm . They owe no money to the accountants , they say , because Arthur Andersen breached the partners ' agreement by jumping into consulting , too . The consultants point to papers the firm filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1990 that said that Andersen Consulting , and not Arthur Andersen , would do computer consulting , which makes up the bulk of the consulting work . <p> The consultants are most frustrated by a term in the agreement that requires the more profitable side to transfer money to the other . While the accountants once paid the consultants money , in recent years the consultants have started writing ever bigger checks to the accountants . <p> Last year , Andersen Consulting paid Arthur Andersen $173 million  --  an average contribution of more than $150,000 from each of Andersen Consulting 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each of Arthur Andersen 's 1,700 partners . Larry Levitan , a senior Andersen Consulting partner who retired six months ago , explained how he felt about the payments he had made : " I pick out a partner at Arthur Andersen that I know and I say , ' I 'm buying you a new Mercedes Benz every single year . ' This year I bought him a down payment on a very nice home . " <p> The consultants contend that the accountants are using the money to build a rival consulting practice . <p> " Our partners say , ' Why are we sending our money to a competitor ? ' " Mr. Shaheen said on Dec. 17 after he had filed the request for arbitration , arguing that the two sides should separate because of " irreconcilable differences . " <p> The accountants say the Andersens never agreed that the accountants had to remain accountants and could not consult . Indeed , the accountants have ventured so far from their traditional role of auditing corporate financial statements and preparing tax returns that Arthur Andersen now ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consulting is No. 1 . ARTHUR ANDERSEN 'S consulting ranges from installing software to training employees for overseas assignments to managing a company 's spending on environmental concerns . The firm has even irritated lawyers recently by offering legal services overseas . So it rankles the accountants whenever someone calls Arthur Andersen an " accounting firm . " <p> " Calling us an accounting firm is like calling Disney a cartoon maker or G.E . an appliance manufacturer , " John S. Vita , a spokesman for Arthur Andersen , said recently . " While we were founded on accounting , as Disney was on cartoons and G.E . on appliances , we have outgrown that . " Arthur Andersen should be called , he said , a " multidisciplinary professional services firm . " <p> Some former partners and industry analysts say the hard feelings might have been soothed long ago if it had not been for the egos of the men leading the two sides . " The battle seems to be a battle of wills , " said Mr. Rodenhauser , the New Hampshire analyst . <p> Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last summer when Mr. Shaheen , outspoken and hard-driving , and Mr. Wadia , a soft-spoken lawyer and accountant , each campaigned to become chief executive of Andersen Worldwide . ( Andersen Worldwide , with about 1,600 employees , oversees the administrative affairs of Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting and officially ties the two together . ) <p> The top post opened up after Lawrence A. Weinbach resigned to become chief executive of the Unisys Corporation . In eight years as chief executive , Mr. Weinbach tried , but failed , to bring the Andersens together . He declined to comment last week on the schism . <p> But neither Mr. Shaheen nor Mr. Wadia received the necessary two-thirds vote of all Andersen partners , and the board elected an interim chief , W. Robert Grafton , an Arthur Andersen partner who was then chairman of Andersen Worldwide 's board . <p> The rift has been growing wider ever since . Some observers say Mr. Shaheen made a mistake when , six months after losing his bid for chief executive , he filed for arbitration . One former partner , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris arbitrator decided that the consultants must pay a hefty price to leave , " some partners could choose to stay , and some could leave , and Andersen Consulting could be no more . " <p> MR . BREBACH , who was managing partner of the firm 's North American consulting business until 1988 and worked with Mr. Shaheen , said the Andersen rift would probably be settled peacefully if it were not for Mr. Shaheen . <p> At first , Mr. Shaheen had seemed to be a " mild-mannered guy " from central Illinois , Mr. Brebach said . " He was not one you would say had an ego problem , " he said . " But things change with power . " <p> In an interview , Mr. Shaheen defended his actions , saying he had not acted recklessly by filing for arbitration . He said he had acted in the best interests of all Andersen Consulting partners , not out of his own ambitions . " How could this be reckless ? " he asked . " What would be reckless would be to let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feb. 20 in New York , Andersen Consulting 's lawyers placed the blame on Mr. Wadia , with Mr. Ostrager portraying him as a man who was " full of himself . " Mr. Wadia , who was born in Bombay and now lives in London , is the firm 's first managing partner who has never worked as an auditor  --  making his promotion consistent with Arthur Andersen 's move away from auditing and into consulting . <p> Mr. Ostrager , a lawyer with Simpson Thacher &; Bartlett , which is handling the matter for Andersen Consulting , recounted what happened in Palo Alto on Feb. 11 and 12 , during a meeting of the board of partners . <p> Mr. Ostrager said he had confirmed the meetings ' events by taking sworn depositions from Mr. Wadia and Mr. Grafton , who has found himself in the middle . <p> Near midnight on Feb. 11 , after the dinner that was n't , Mr. Wadia and one other Arthur Andersen partner met privately with Mr. Grafton , Mr. Ostrager said at the hearing . Mr. Wadia showed Mr. Grafton a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said he planned to present it to the board the next day . <p> But Mr. Grafton told Mr. Wadia that he believed the resolution was inconsistent with advice he had received from the firm 's lawyers , Mr. Ostrager said . Mr. Grafton said board members could not vote on any matter related to the arbitration proceeding in Paris because each member was a party to that divorce filing and , therefore , had a conflict of interest . <p> The next day , though , Mr. Wadia ignored Mr. Grafton 's warning and put the resolution before the board . It passed , even though Mr. Grafton and all the Andersen Consulting partners voted against it . The resolution states that the arbitration request was a " scheme " by the consultants " to avoid all duties and obligations they owe to their fellow partners . " <p> The next day , Feb. 13 , Mr. Wadia sent a memo to Arthur Andersen 's partners saying the board had " put on record their intention to pursue and investigate Andersen Consulting 's behavior . " <p> Mr. Wadia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an attached letter that said the consultants were trying to " inflict pain " on Arthur Andersen in December when they publicized the feud . " Was it really worth it ? " Mr. Wadia wrote . " That misconduct , more than anything else , has galvanized Arthur Andersen and has made it more resolute than ever before . " <p> Mr. Wadia declined to comment on the events , citing the continuing litigation . <p> While it may be years before the Andersens settle their differences , it is clear that life at Andersen Worldwide  --  where most partners were hired as college graduates  --  will never be the same . <p> One former consulting partner remembers the anxiety he felt years ago , when there had been talk of the consultants ' going their own way . <p> " I had spent a lot of time and effort becoming partner , and I was thinking that all that hard work and my future were over , " he said . " There must be a lot of that same anxiety now . " <p> Graph showing yearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through 1997 .
