Unlike certain other mythical creatures , the griffin has never gained acceptance as a suitable domestic companion . <p> A dragon raised from the egg can be very useful around the house , especially for lighting a fire quickly on chilly mornings . The only drawback to a dragon , aside from size , is the risk of a cough or sneeze setting off an unintended conflagration . But preventive measures can be taken . Early removal of the fire-breathing organs ( a painless alteration if done in the creature 's first half-century ) renders a dragon not only safe but sleek , docile , and affectionate . According to experts on the subject , the procedure also improves general health and extends the life span . Altered dragons are said to be especially good with children . <p> A troll , if taken young and raised within a caring family group , can be an invaluable help , particularly in the kitchen . Close supervision is required until it learns to follow recipes exactly , but a properly trained troll is fit to serve as chef to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picky about living conditions , can be a pleasing and useful home companion . Unicorns require constant attention and firm handling , but they are clean , attractive creatures and discourage lions from hanging about . <p> A griffin is something else entirely . For one thing , a griffin is very big . It is also very noisy . It has few social graces and makes no effort to acquire any . Its disposition is unpredictable , its strength awesome , its anger terrible . Even the spelling of its name can lead to controversy : disputes are frequent among those who spell it griffin , griffon , and gryphon . Granted , a griffin will keep a home free of rats and mice ; but its appetite is not satisfied by small creatures . It considers a dog or cat an appetizer , and a pony a light but satisfying supper . A pair of well-fed Belgians seventeen hands high would be no more than a filling meal . People of sense and good judgment do not attempt to domesticate a griffin . They keep their dealings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them altogether . <p> Thus Kedrigern 's surprise at the content of an urgent communique from an old client . He unfurled the scroll with interest . The message was gorgeously rubricated , formal in style and diction , but the intent was plain and unmistakable . <p> To the justly famed and powerful wizard Kedrigern , master of counterspells and disenchantments , from his friend and comrade Tyasan , Lord of the Misty Marshes . <p> Whereas Cecil , our cherished household griffin , has not eaten in three weeks , is molting in an unsightly way , and does not respond to treatment ; and <p> Whereas the physicians and chirurgeons of the court are unable to find the cause of this noble creature 's suffering , much less a cure for it , and <p> Whereas the aforesaid Cecil 's condition manifests signs of magical origin , viz. a malediction placed upon him by enemies of the kingdom with the aim of distressing , discomposing , and discomfiting Our Royal Self and the Royal Family , <p> Therefore your presence is urgently required at Castle Contrecoeur . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , where it promptly rolled itself up . He paced about the room , muttering and kicking the scroll before him , and at last he snatched it up , dropped into a chair , and glared into the fire . <p> His wife looked into the doorway . " What is it now ? " <p> He thrust the scroll at her . " This . It just arrived . From Tyasan . " <p> " I do n't recall the name . Do we know him ? " <p> " He has a small kingdom off to the north of the Dismal Bog . I did him a service nine or ten years ago , and now he wants me to drop everything and run to his aid again . " <p> Princess took the scroll and opened it out on the table , placing heavy candelabra at top and bottom to keep it from rerolling . She read it over and said , " It seems reasonable . He 's got a sick griffin on his hands , and he wants you to help . Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A very highly specialized physician . I 'm a wizard . I do n't do griffins . " <p> " Griffins are mythical creatures . Maybe they require treatment by a wizard . " <p> Kedrigern reflected on that for a moment , then shook his head . " Not so far as I know . I 've heard of griffins being cured by holy men , but not by wizards . " <p> " This might be a special case . " <p> Kedrigern scowled . " Kings always think their problems are a special case . " <p> Placing her arms akimbo , Princess gave him a straight look . " My father was a king . " <p> Kedrigern was willing to give a bit , but not too much . " I 'm sure he was a very nice king . But I never met your father . Most of the kings I 've met have been . . . well , just look at that note ! The arrogance of the man ! As if he need only snap his fingers and I 'm to drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ griffin 's talon and pour syrups down its throat . I 've just come back from working a very difficult counterspell , and he  --  " <p> " If you 're going to call yourself a master counterspeller , you ca n't complain when someone asks you to work a counterspell . " <p> " It 's the way they ask . " <p> " Well , if Tyasan 's an old friend  --  " <p> Kedrigern flung up his hands in frustration . " He 's not ! That 's what annoys me most , this pretense that we 're old pals . He did n't say a dozen words to me when I was there last , and now he tries to sound like a boyhood chum . " <p> " Do n't be impatient with him . The man 's desperate . It 's possible to become very fond of a pet . " <p> " My dear , no one knows better than you that I 'm a patient man . The soul of kindness . I am filled with love for all living things , griffins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ griffin as a household pet , and I resent being summoned to the aid of a silly man because the consequences of his silliness have finally caught up with him . " <p> Princess raised an eyebrow , but said nothing . She returned her attention to the scroll . <p> In a milder tone , Kedrigern went on , " I do n't like to refuse help to an old client  --  even when he 's presumptuous and demanding  --  but I do n't know anything about healing sick griffins . " <p> " Tyasan says that the griffin might be spelled . You know about despelling victims of wicked spells . " <p> " I 'm sure the reference to a spell is a desperate guess on the part of the physicians . It 's highly unlikely that Cecil has been spelled . If anyone with sense wanted to discompose the royal family , they 'd put the spell on them , not on their griffin . " <p> " Would they ? " said Princess . She pointed with a delicate fingertip to a handwritten addendum far down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had unrolled it . He rose , grumbling , and joined her at the table . The postscript read : <p> Please come , Dear K. The children will be heartbroken if they lose their Cecil . <p> Your old comrade , Tyasan . Kedrigern gazed long at the message . He looked up helplessly and sighed . <p> Princess let the scroll furl and tapped the ends into neat alignment . " I 'll tell Spot to start packing . We 'll leave in the mornings " she said . <p> " We ? " <p> " You do n't think I 'm going to pass up a chance to visit a royal court , do you ? Even if it means sitting up with a sick griffin . " <p> The castle of Contrecoeur was five days ' unhurried ride from the cottage on Silent Thunder Mountain , and the weather was ideal for travel . The skies were clear , the sun bright . The roads had dried after the spring rains , but summer had not yet encumbered the land with heat and dust and small insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woods were splashed with shadings of green highlighted with the brightness of flowers . Fragrance and birdsong filled the air . All appeared tranquil , but Kedrigern felt increasingly ill at ease . Finally , on the morning of the fifth day , he reined in his horse and dropped back to Princess ' side . <p> " There are people nearby , " he said . <p> " It 's the season for traveling . " <p> " I know it is , and yet we have n't seen a soul on the road so far . Now I sense a large crowd , and they 're not in a friendly mood . Probably robbers and marauders . " <p> " Are you sure ? There 's not much to rob out here , is there ? " <p> " There 's us . " <p> Princess looked thoughtful . " Well , I 'm sure you can handle a band  --  " she began , when an arrow whistled between them , others zipped overhead , and a loud shout came from the wood . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick shielding spell around them as he dug his heels in . They galloped to the last bend in the forest road , where a barrier blocked their way . No sooner had they halted than a score of archers , bows at the ready , emerged from the surrounding wood and six pikemen advanced on them , led by a swordsman . <p> " It 's all right , my dear . These are Tyasan 's men , " said Kedrigern . <p> " Stand and unfold yourselves ! " the swordsman demanded . <p> " We are friends to this ground , come at the request of King Tyasan . I am the wizard Kedrigern , and this lady is my wife and colleague . " <p> At the name , the swordsman sheathed his blade and said , in a much more cordial tone , " Welcome to the Kingdom of the Misty Marshes . You are fortunate indeed to have come this far in safety . " <p> " We encountered some bandits in the forest . " <p> " Not bandits , wizard , but enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chief Defender of the Realm has become known , our enemies have grown bold . Three outlying hamlets have been raided . An invasion may come at any moment . " <p> " Tyasan did n't mention that . We 'd better hurry . " <p> " I will provide you with a guide . " <p> " No need , no need . I know the way , " said Kedrigern , urging his horse forward . " Just raise that barrier . " <p> They reached the castle in the early afternoon , and were welcomed to Contrecoeur and the Kingdom of the Misty Marshes by Tyasan himself . The king was wreathed in smiles , and greeted them warmly . <p> " My good old friend , we knew you would come . Our troubles now are over , " he said , embracing Kedrigern . " And this must be your wife , as famed for her magical talent as for her beauty and wisdom . " <p> Princess rose from her saddle with a flutter of her gauzy little wings and flew lightly to Tyasan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She curtseyed gracefully . <p> " We have heard you praised for many qualities , my lady , but we knew nothing of your ability to fly , " said Tyasan . <p> " It 's just something I picked up on a quest , " she said with a delicate gesture of dismissal . <p> " The royal children will be delighted to meet someone at once so lovely , so charming , and so gifted . You must be kind to them . They are much troubled by Cecil 's condition . " <p> " How old are they , Tyasan ? They were n't even born when I was here last . " <p> The king beamed upon them . " I remember the occasion well . I had only recently wed my fair queen Thrymm . She was sorely afflicted , but you came to her aid , old friend . " <p> " What was her problem ? " Princess asked . <p> " Spiders . " <p> " Is n't it customary to call an exterminator ? " <p> " These spiders popped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . <p> " It was especially unpleasant when she talked in her sleep , " Tyasan said with a slight shudder of distaste . " A single oversight in drawing up the guest list , and it caused us no end of inconvenience and distress . You can imagine how punctilious we were in sending out invitations to the royal christenings . " <p> Kedrigern , not having received an invitation to either christening , was about to speak , but Princess silenced him with a stern glance . He held back his retort and instead asked , " This problem with the griffin , Tyasan . How long has . . . ? " <p> Oblivious , Tyasan went on , " Ah , those were the good old days , were they not ? How I miss those long walks , those stimulating games of chess , those late night conversations over a goblet of excellent wine , with the fire roaring . Many a time have we seen the sun rise after a night of fine talk . " He heaved a nostalgic sigh and clapped Kedrigern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in touch , old friend . " <p> Tyasan 's cozy memories were pure fiction . Kedrigern again started to speak , but Princess asked , " And what are the ages of the little prince and princess , your highness ? " <p> " Please , my dear , call me Tyasan . Better still , call me Ty . All my close friends do , and I count you both among my closest friends . " <p> " And your children ? " <p> He gave her a puzzled look . " I count them as family . " <p> " I meant their ages . How old are they ? " <p> " Ah , yes , of course . Their ages . Eldry is the older by a year . She 'll be about eight or so very soon . And that would make Ashel about seven . Give or take a year or two . Yes , that sounds right . " <p> " And they 're fond of this griffin ? " <p> " My lady , they dote on the creature , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . . . one or the other . I ca n't recall now . The three of them have grown up together . " <p> " An unusual christening gift , is n't it ? " <p> " A most unusual gift indeed , my lady . He was sent by a distant cousin from the land of the Scythians . They have many strange customs in that part of the world . " <p> Kedrigern , recalling that one of the nastier Scythian customs had something to do with feeding unruly children to a griffin , felt a twinge of alarm . " Your cousin , or Queen Thrymm 's ? " <p> " Mine . Charming old fellow , Gulberan . Soul of generosity . Immensely fond of children . Everyone loved him . We were very close . " <p> Tyasan 's word were reassuring , but Kedrigern wanted more . " Have you many Scythian relatives ? " <p> " None at all . Never did . Gulberan only went to Scythia for the climate . That and the gold . Gold all over the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peasants thatch their hovels with it . Birds use it to build their nests . But enough small talk . You must come inside . Thrymm is around the palace somewhere . She 'll want to meet you , unless she 's resting . This business with Cecil has her depressed . Makes her sleepy . " <p> " The prospect of invasion must be upsetting for her , " said Kedrigern . <p> " Oh , that . Yes , I suppose so . No cause for concern , though . Once Cecil is up and about , the neighbors will quiet down and there 'll be no more talk of invasion . " <p> Kedrigern nodded . He tried to look confident . This was a far more serious matter than he had anticipated . <p> Tyasan took Princess ' arm and said in a confiding way , " You 'll meet Thrymm when we dine , in any event . I expect you 'd like to wash up and take a nap before dinner . Travel is so fatiguing , and we 've got quite a night planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , performing dogs . Just like old times . eh , Kedrigern ? " <p> Princess brightened at every word Tyasan spoke . By the time he was done , she was fluttering a full hand 's breadth off the ground . " It sounds wonderful ! " With a sharp glance at Kedrigern , she added , " One does sacrifice certain amenities when one lives in isolation on a mountaintop . " <p> Kedrigern did not share her exhilaration . If he could not cure Cecil , he knew , he would be obliged to help defend Tyasan 's little kingdom against invasion , and he disliked such work . It was always unpleasant . Sometimes it was downright nasty . " I 'd better have a look at Cecil . " <p> " He 's in his shed on the wall , next to the north tower . " <p> " I 'll go now , if you do n't mind . Care to come along , my dear ? " <p> " I leave it all in your hands , " said Princess , practically glowing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for this evening . " <p> Cecil Dwelt in a spacious , well-constructed shed on the lee side of the tower . As Kedrigern approached , he saw a boy and a girl sitting beside the entry . From a distance , their posture suggested dejection ; up close , their expressions confirmed it . But the moment they caught sight of him they sprang up and ran to his side to welcome him with joyous shouts . <p> The girl cried , " You 're the wizard Daddy sent for ! Are n't you ? Tell us you are ! " <p> " Of course you are ! You 'll make our Cecil well again so he can go out and tear our enemies to bits ! " said the boy , taking Kedrigern 's hand and tugging him toward the shed . <p> Clearly these were Eldry and Ashel . Kedrigern was impressed by the children 's perceptiveness . He made it a point to dress plainly and avoid displaying indications of his profession . It avoided complications . " I 'll do everything I can . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Daddy sent for a wizard . You had to come , " Ashel said . <p> " And besides , nobody but a wizard would dare to come near Cecil . The others are all afraid of him . Especially the physicians . " <p> " You do n't seem afraid of him , " Kedrigern said . <p> " Cecil is our friend and protector . He 's really a very nice griffin . He always sounds cross , but he 's not the least bit nasty , not really . " <p> They stopped at the entry and the children released his hands . " You 'd better go in alone , " Eldry said . " We 'll be right outside . " <p> " Do n't be afraid , " said Ashel . " He wo n't hurt you . " <p> Cecil lay sprawled on a thick bed of straw . His breathing was a loud wheeze . His mouth , once red as a roaring furnace , was a pale pink . His eyes , big as basins , were glazed and bloodshot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer , appeared dusty and faded and very patchy . Flies clustered about sores on his tawny hide . His ribs were clearly visible . Huge black , red , blue , and white feathers were scattered everywhere . He appeared to be in worse condition than Tyasan had claimed . <p> His disposition , however , was still griffin-like . As soon as he became aware of the wizard 's presence , he raised his head , opened his fierce hooked beak , and in a grating voice said , " What do you mean , bursting in here like that ? Go away ! If I catch you prowling around my lair again , I 'll dismember you ! " <p> Kedrigern was unintimidated . " King Tyasan has asked me here to see what can be done about your condition . " <p> " Get lost , butcher . I 'm in perfect health . " <p> " I will not leave until I 've examined you . " <p> Struggling unsteadily to his feet , Cecil said , " That 's what you think . Try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose your own . All of it . " <p> " I 'm not a physician , I 'm a wizard . " <p> " Prove it : make yourself disappear . " <p> " Tyasan thinks there 's a possibility you 've been spelled . " <p> Cecil gave a quick snarling laugh . " Fat lot Tyasan knows . I can take any spell they throw at me . I 'm a griffin . " <p> " All the same , I have to check . " The griffin hissed and snapped his beak , but made no further hostile move . Kedrigern drew out his medallion and inspected Cecil through the Aperture of True Vision . He found no trace of enchantment . <p> " All right , you checked . Now run off and collect your fee . " <p> " I want to do a few more tests , " Kedrigern said . He reached out to give Cecil a reassuring pat . <p> " Lay a hand on me and your name is Lefty . " <p> " Cecil , you have to cooperate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom is in danger . Eldry and Ashel  --  " <p> Cecil raised a thick foreleg and flexed four wicked-looking talons . " Leave those kids out of it , you hear ? Anybody messes with those kids , he answers to me . " <p> " I 'm here for their sake , Cecil . They 're worried about you . " <p> " Shut up . " <p> " If anything happens to you , they 'll be heartbroken . " <p> " Shut up , I said ! All I need is a good rest . Go away and maybe I can get it . " <p> Kedrigern could see that he was going to get no more out of Cecil . He had already learned that no magic was involved , and that was useful to know . And Cecil was apparently as fond of the children as they were of him . That might provide an approach . But griffins are short tempered ; to press Cecil further would probably do more harm than good . " All right , Cecil , I 'll leave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be back . " <p> " Do n't hurry . " <p> " I 'll be back tomorrow . " <p> " Maybe I 'll be lucky and die in my sleep . " Cecil slumped down in the straw , turned his back on the wizard , and almost at once began to snore . <p> Once outside , Kedrigern was confronted with two expectant , hopeful faces . <p> " Is he well ? Did you make him better ? " Ashel demanded . <p> " It 's too soon to say . But I 've learned a few things . Maybe you can help me . " <p> " We are at your service , " said Eldry with queenly dignity . " Anything for our dear Cecil . " <p> " How long has he been like this ? " <p> " Since the spring , " Eldry said , and Ashel nodded and added , " Early in the spring . " <p> " Has it ever happened before ? " <p> " Never , " they said in one voice . <p> " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an injury ? Did you observe any odd behavior ? " the wizard asked , receiving an unequivocal negative each time . <p> Eldry began , " He was perfectly fine . At the end of winter he gave his lair a thorough cleaning and built himself a lovely new nest of fresh straw  --  " <p> " And then he got sick , " Ashel broke in . <p> Kedrigern nodded and stroked his chin thoughtfully , doing his best to convey an impression of confidence . " Thank you both . You 've been a help . " <p> Ashel tugged at the wizard 's sleeve . " Do you know what 's wrong ? " <p> " Can you fix it ? " Eldry asked . <p> " I 've narrowed my field of inquiry . I 'll be back to see Cecil in the morning . Perhaps then I 'll be able to determine the exact problem . " <p> " Please do it , wizard . Save our Cecil , " Said Ashel , looking up with moist eyes . He turned away , unwilling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kedrigern , " You must . Poor Ashel would never get over it if we lost the dear creature . And we 'd be invaded , besides . " <p> " I 'll do everything in my power . And if I ca n't help Cecil myself , I 'll do my best to find someone who can . Now let 's all go back to the castle and have a nice snack , and let Cecil get some rest . " <p> There was no time , and little inclination , for shop talk before dinner . Throughout the evening , over one elaborate and superbly prepared dish after another , amid the singing of minstrels and the whirling of dancers and the tumbling of dogs and acrobats , the drinking of toasts and the bursts of merry laughter , Kedrigern pondered the case . He was able to do so without interruption ; Princess , looking her loveliest , was the center of all eyes . No one paid attention to a moody wizard , nor to the haggard , dusty messengers who turned up at frequent intervals with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ponder . Griffins were famed for their rugged good health . He had never read or heard of griffins ' ailments , and knew no griffins personally , so he had no ready source of information . Griffins , so far as he knew , were not prey to sickness . And yet Cecil was definitely sick . Could he be some odd species of griffin ? Had he succumbed to an illness unknown in Scythia ? Was he getting the proper food ? Enough to drink ? Could the climate of the Misty Marshes be affecting his health ? These were all questions to be asked tomorrow . <p> Princess settled beside Kedrigern , breathless and happy . " I have n't had such a delightful time in ages ! The courtiers are charming . And the musicians are excellent . And everyone dances so well . " <p> " I notice you 've been dancing every dance . " <p> " Yes . And you have n't left your seat . " <p> " You know I 'm a terrible dancer , my dear . And I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not the least bit cooperative . " <p> " Griffins are n't , as a rule , are they ? " <p> " I do n't like to think of the children losing their pet and then having the kingdom invaded . " <p> " Is he that bad ? " <p> " I 'm afraid so . Come and see for yourself tomorrow . " <p> She rose and took him by the hand . " I will . And I 'm sure you 'll think of something . Now come and dance . It will do you good . " <p> " Oh , I really do n't . . . " <p> " Come . It 's a very easy one . You 'll pick it up in no time . " <p> They slept late next day . It was mid-morning when they climbed to the platform where Cecil 's shed stood . Kedrigern had expected to find the royal children awaiting them , but Cecil was alone . <p> " You again . I told you to keep away , " he said in welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants me to look after you . " <p> " Who 's this ? Your assistant ? " <p> " I am a princess , " said Princess with dignity . <p> Cecil yawned . " Good for you . Who asked you to butt in ? " <p> " There 's no need to be rude , Cecil . We 're here to help you . We want to get you back to normal . " <p> " If I were feeling normal , I 'd be a lot ruder . Now go away and leave me alone . It 's bad enough to feel rotten without having nosy intruders barging in on my privacy . " <p> Kedrigern was not to be put off . " Where does it hurt , Cecil ? " <p> " None of your business . " <p> " I 'm just going to keep asking until I get an answer . " <p> Princess frowned at Kedrigern . " Do n't be so inconsiderate to the poor dear creature . " She turned to Cecil and said in her sweetest voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet your poor head is aching terribly , but you do n't complain . " <p> Cecil glared at her for a moment , then muttered , " I can take it . " <p> " Oh , you poor brave thing , " she said . <p> " Stop pooring me , lady . I 'm a griffin . We 're tough . " <p> " Of course you are . Tough , and brave , and decent . And loyal to King Tyasan . And devoted to the royal children . And all this time your head is throbbing , throbbing , throbbing . " Princess wiped her eyes . <p> His voice somewhat less rasping , Cecil said , " Not really . The headache comes and goes . It 's the loss of appetite that bothers me the most . And the general lassitude . " <p> " Dear good Cecil , " said Princess . She reached out cautiously to stroke the griffin 's forehead . He did not shrink from her touch . She dug her fingers into the feathers and scratched the broad expanse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of creaky purring . " Do n't you want anything at all to eat ? " she asked . <p> Dreamily , Cecil said , " Not a thing , lady . Just keep scratching . Get the back of my neck . " <p> With a quick wink to Kedrigern , Princess leaned closer and applied both hands to her work . Cecil sank down , his eyes closed contentedly , and his purring grew to a reverberating drone that filled the shed . Princess knelt at his side and scratched . After a time , Cecil said sleepily , " You know , lady , I could go for a nice basin of horse meat broth . Maybe they could put a few chunks of meat in it . " <p> " We 'll have it brought up right away . " <p> " Send the wizard . You stay here and keep scratching . " <p> She turned to Kedrigern and shrugged . He nodded and tiptoed from the shed . <p> On his way to the kitchen he met Eldry and Ashel . They looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're late . " <p> " Your father does not encourage early rising on the part of his guests . And I 've made progress . Cecil has asked for a basin of broth . " <p> " Is that all ?

" <p> " Is your wife pretty ? He likes to have his head scratched by pretty ladies . " <p> Kedrigern smiled at the image of Princess , resplendent this morning in a deep maroon gown trimmed at wrists and neckline with gold embroidery ; no jewelry but a golden circlet around her gleaming black hair and a long gold necklace that hung to her waist . " She 's very pretty indeed . Look here  --  why do n't you supervise the making of the broth ? You know how Cecil likes it . I 'll go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were off at a run , and Kedrigern returned to the hut . He stood in the doorway for a time , looking on in silence as Princess scratched Cecil 's great neck and his upper back between the shoulders . Her treatment was working wonders ; he had shown improvement from her very first touch and was now reclining peacefully , snoring with a faint , not unpleasant , whistling sound . <p> It was strenuous work for Princess . She was forced to lean forward awkwardly . From time to time she paused to ease her back and flex her fingers , but the pauses were brief and she quickly resumed her work . She was a picture of selfless dedication , and Kedrigern felt proud of her . Not many princesses would be so considerate of a griffin . <p> But why was it working ? Surely mere head-scratching , even by the hand of a princess , could not be the cure . As Kedrigern watched he noticed that as Princess bent over Cecil , her gold necklace lay against the griffin 's side . Something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite grasp it . Something about griffins . . . and gold . . . . Griffins and gold . . . Scythia . . . thatching . . . and the making of nests . <p> And that was it . <p> He hurried to Princess ' side and whispered , " You can stop scratching . I 'm going to put your necklace around Cecil 's neck . He 'll be all right now . " <p> " He will ? " <p> " For a while , anyway . " <p> " That 's not a magic necklace , you know . " <p> " It 's gold . That 's all that matters . " <p> She rose stiffly and wrung her hands . " Good . I would n't want to do that for much longer . Cecil has very rough feathers .

" <p> " I 'm pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how much Tyasan thinks of his griffin . " <p> They gathered in an antechamber just off the throne room . Tyasan and Thrymm , having heard the wizard 's explanation and Princess ' anecdotal support , exchanged a long silent glance . Tyasan turned to his guests . <p> " A nest of gold ? " he said . <p> Kedrigern nodded . " That 's what it will take . " <p> " A nest for Cecil would require a huge amount of gold . I would n't have anything left to pay your fee . " <p> With a generous wave of his hand , Kedrigern said , " We 're willing to accept gems and silver . Your Cecil is suffering from acute gold deprivation . If you want him to be his old self , you 'll have to provide him with a nest of gold . " <p> Tyasan looked pained . " Are you absolutely sure ? " <p> " As soon as Princess ' gold necklace touched him , Cecil relaxed and his appetite returned . That 's when I realized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his neck ? Maybe if all my subjects took turns scratching . . . . " <p> " It was n't my scratching that did it , " Princess said , " although I 'm sure it helped . Long after I had stopped , Cecil finished his basin of broth and called for a haunch of horse meat . " <p> " He spoke of flying out to the borders tomorrow , and seeing what the neighbors are up to , " Kedrigern added . " I think you can stop worrying about an invasion . " <p> With a sigh of relief , Thrymm said , " Cecil 's himself again . " <p> " But it wo n't last unless he stays in contact with a substantial amount of gold . Once griffins reach a certain age , it 's essential to their health . That 's why they use gold for nesting material back in Scythia , " Kedrigern said . <p> " They only use it because it 's so easily available . There 's gold lying all over the place in Scythia . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be wrong . How much gold did your cousin Gulberan amass during his stay ? " <p> Tyasan reflected for a moment , then looked at them with an expression of discomfort . " None , as a matter of fact . Poor old chap died penniless . " When neither Kedrigern nor Princess made reply , he went on desperately , " What if we used brass ? I 'd have it polished up . It could pass for gold if we kept it polished . " <p> " Griffins are rude , but they 're not stupid . Cecil would n't last long , and he 'd be a mighty angry griffin toward the end . " <p> " Could n't you hypnotize him , or create an illusion of some sort ? " <p> Kedrigern shook his head . " It has to be real gold . Substitutions wo n't work . " <p> They sat in silence , pondering the problem , and Princess looked up brightly and said , . " Just as a temporary measure you might try gold leaf . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kedrigern added . " But only until you can get enough gold together for a nest . " <p> " We 'll demand reparations from our neighbors , " said Thrymm . " They ought to do something to make up for all the annoyance they 've caused with their talk of invasion . " <p> Tyasan stared dejectedly at the ground , slowly shaking his head . " They have n't got a thimbleful of gold among them . All we 'll get from that lot is hides and firewood . " <p> The four sat silent for a time . Thrymm raised her eyes to the heavens and said , " Why could n't Gulberan have sent the children a dog ? " <p> " Maybe there are no dogs in Scythia . " <p> The queen shrugged . " All right , a cat . Even a monkey would be less trouble . " <p> " As protection , Cecil is worth a brigade of guards . He 's devoted to Eldry and Ashel . They could n't have a better companion . Once he has his strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dogs and cats ca n't do that , " Kedrigern pointed out . " Or monkeys . " <p> " But all that gold . . . . " <p> Princess said , " It 's not as though he 'll eat the gold , or squander it foolishly . It will all be right there in his shed . " <p> " That 's true , " said Thrymm without much enthusiasm . <p> " And well guarded , " Princess added . " Too well guarded , " said Tyasan . <p> " If you really need it , Ty , I 'm sure Cecil will let you have some , " the queen said . <p> Tyasan looked at his wife , his face a mask of gloom . " I know you 're trying to console me , Thrymmie dear , but it 's unpleasant for a king to contemplate asking household help for a loan . It 's demeaning . " <p> A long silence followed , broken at last by Kedrigern . Putting his fingertips together , gazing into the middle distance , speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " Since Cecil is in the nest-building mood , it probably wo n't be long before he 's ready to settle down . He 'll return to Scythia to seek a mate  --  " <p> " What will I do for protection ? " Tyasan cried . " Without Cecil , I 'll have to hire an army ! Either way , I 'm ruined . " <p> " Cecil will be back . He 's very content here , and I doubt he 'd leave the children . With a family to look after , he 'll want to build a bigger nest . That means  --  " <p> " That means I 'll have to find even more gold ! " Tyasan wailed , burying his face in his hands . <p> " Griffins are proud creatures . He 'll go out and get it himself . Lots and lots of it . Griffins know where to find gold . And if Eldry and Ashel ask him nicely  --  " <p> " He 'd do anything for the children , " Thrymm said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two for them . . . . " <p> Tyasan looked up . His expression was that of a man who had clutched at the last straw and caught the whole bale . <p> " . . . And their parents , " Kedrigern concluded . <p> <p> By John Morressy <p> When writers ask why we do n't publish more wizard stories , I point to our John Morressy 's Kedrigern series ( which we have published for over a decade now ) and respond , " Why should we when we already publish the best ? " Only a handful of wizards can compare to Kedrigern . Even that mythical favorite , Merlin , sometimes has trouble keeping up <p> " Nest Egg " is Kedrigern 's most recent adventure . Enjoy . <p>
